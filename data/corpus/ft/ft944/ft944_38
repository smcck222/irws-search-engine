FT  01 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: An unpalatable fix for some European
regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RODDY CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Jackson, (Letters, October 26) correctly states that moving
to irrevocable fixed exchange rates is a more attractive option in many ways
than moving straight to a single currency. Cocaine is also a lower health
risk than heroin, and I suspect he would find the medium-term effects of
either fix unpalatable.
The basic economic argument is clear, and cannot be repeated too often. It
is that fixed exchange rates in an environment of less than free capital and
labour markets, both in mobility and price, worsen regional recessions.
Europe's labour markets are far from free, and we are facing a big
employment challenge now and for the foreseeable future.
The introduction of fixed rates can only make that challenge harder.
As Germany will not accept a common currency, but would accept fixed rates,
I expect we will get them, and the unemployed somewhere in Europe will be
paying for Mr Jackson's 'relief from the cost and fuss of changing
currencies'.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sharpening of public scrutiny is
vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JON STERN and RICHARD PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Fundamental Expenditure Review of the Treasury has inevitably
generated widespread debate. As ex-Treasury micro-economists now working as
economic consultants in the private sector, we strongly endorse your
concerns (Leader, October 20) about the implications for public expenditure
control.
In essence, there are two ways of effectively controlling public
expenditure.
The first is the traditional British way in which a central agency (the
Treasury) controls all aspects of public expenditure by active and detailed
monitoring and control over the composition, as well as the volume, of all
public spending programmes.
The second way is to decentralise, setting overall financial targets but
opting out of monitoring the composition of expenditure. This requires
setting and enforcing hard budget constraints on all public sector bodies.
Those that cannot cover their costs from the revenues allocated from the
centre then have either to cut back their activities, to increase revenues,
or to borrow on capital markets without central government guarantees. This
is the model on which states and local authorities operate in the US and the
Lander operate in Germany.
As a relatively centralised, unitary country, Britain has consistently opted
for the former model and the Treasury has traditionally been its strongest
advocate. The Fundamental Review, however, marks a significant shift towards
the decentralised model. The main worry must be that devolving
responsibilities as proposed will not, in practice, be accompanied by an
effective hardening of budget constraints on government departments,
agencies and quangos.
Your leader is also right to point to the Treasury's role in dealing with
departmental advocacy of vested interests. Your recent article ('Helicopter
makers in a spin', October 6) on important forthcoming defence procurement
decisions, demonstrated the pressures that powerful industrial groups can
wield.
The Treasury has played an important role in forcing proper examination of
the economic choices underlying such decisions. It would be a big loss if
the proposed Treasury functional and staff cutbacks led to a reduction in
the power of the appraisal process and an increase in the influence of
'do-it-yourself' economics.
As the chancellor has accepted the review as the basis for action, the key
question is how to ensure that these potential dangers are minimised. The
answer must involve increased public scrutiny. In particular, the role of
systematic evaluation becomes even more important in the new system, both in
assessing the economic effectiveness of programmes and in comparing outcomes
against their objectives.
Progress in public scrutiny will be a big factor in determining how far
private sector financial disciplines can be applied to the public sector,
including the decentralised bodies developing in areas such as health and
education.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JUDITH CHURCH, MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'France ponders superhighway gamble' (October 27), raises
important issues which need to be addressed in this country.
France Telecom's reluctance to accept the central financial role recommended
in Mr Thery's report is in direct contrast to the position of British
Telecom, which is one of the leading players in the information superhighway
dialogue in the UK and has already made a commitment to a Pounds 15bn
investment in the infra-structure.
The technology, the financial means and, crucially, the vision to develop a
UK plc information superhighway exist, but our main obstacle is the
government's lack of a strategic policy.
As stated in the trade and industry committee's report on optical fibre
networks, published in July: 'There appears to be little sense of urgency
and a lack of a clear sense of vision about what broadband communications
could do for the UK and its people.'
We need urgent action to address the implications of the developing global
information infrastructure and the role of the private sector in this
process. Removal of the asymmetry principle is one example of what is
needed.
The telecommunications industry waits for no person. Labour recognises that
government has a crucial responsibility in propelling UK plc into the lead
in the development of a European and global information infrastructure. At
the moment it's on everyone's agenda except this government's.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Personal View: Party politics of growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT J. BARRO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK politicians have recently begun debating the economic theory of
'endogenous growth'. For a visiting economist from the US, it is hard to
know which side in the discussion to prefer.
The Labour party's shadow chancellor, Gordon Brown, seems serious in his
attempts to understand and apply the idea. However, he uses it in a confused
way to rationalise government intervention in the economy.
On the government side, chancellor Kenneth Clarke dwells on the funny sound
of endogenous growth and depicts it as some sort of econo-babble that he
need not try to understand. I suppose if it really were 'indigenous growth',
as he recently joked, he would be correct.
With some temerity, I venture to explain the origins of endogenous growth
and its relation to the older neoclassical theory of economic growth.
The neoclassical model, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, assumed that
technological change was needed if growth of income per head were to be
sustained in the long run. Without it, growth would slow as the returns on
capital such as machines, buildings or skills diminished.
The rate of technological progress, however, could not be explained by the
theory, so it was treated as an exogenous influence. This was not as a
matter of principle but because the necessary theoretical advances had not
been made. As a consequence, the economy's long-run growth rate was
exogenous: the theory could not explain what drove it.
There was a role in the neo-classical model for investment and government
policy in stimulating economic growth. Growth can be increased for a long
time by more investment and better policies such as lower marginal tax
rates, more productive infrastructure, better enforcement of laws and
contracts, price stability. But in the very long run, the neoclassical
theory cannot explain what drives growth.
In the late 1980s, Paul Romer, an economist at the University of California
at Berkeley, came up with a theory that appeared to explain the factors
behind technological advance. He postulated that it was commercial research
and development which led to the discovery and adoption of new technologies,
products and ideas. By explaining the rate of technological progress in
economic terms, the factors behind a country's long-run growth rate were
endogenous, contained within the model.
A crucial element in technological progress in this theory was the reward
given to innovators. In the absence of some prize, would-be entrepreneurs
have no incentive to carry out costly and often unsuccessful research
projects. Typically, the reward is a temporary period of monopoly power,
during which a new product or the fruits of an improved technology can be
priced above the competitive level.
This process is clear for pharmaceuticals, where discoveries are protected
for a period by patenting - a fact that appears to escape US health
reformers such as Hillary Clinton. She wants to force competition on
pharmaceuticals companies that produce successful drugs without worrying
about whether any new drugs would ever be developed.
In Romer's model, the growth rate may be lower than is desirable and there
may be a role for government in promoting growth. Many observers have taken
this conclusion as a licence to advocate government intervention, such as
trade restrictions, support for favoured industries and regulation of the
labour market.
In fact, the main policy implications from the endogenous growth model are
that the government should support basic research (especially that by
economists at American universities]) and take a more favourable view of
monopoly in high-growth sectors.
Some analysis by endogenous growth theorists suggests that many kinds of
government intervention - such as industrial policies aimed at picking and
subsidising technological winners, distortions of international trade, and
restrictions of labour markets - are especially damaging because they reduce
long-term growth rates. Endogenous growth theory cannot be used to justify
minimum wage rates, strong labour unions, housing subsidies or large welfare
payments.
From an empirical standpoint, the most successful framework for
understanding growth has proved to be a combination of the new, endogenous
growth theory with the older, neoclassical model. The new theory explains
the growth performance of technological leaders; in particular, why these
countries - and therefore the world as a whole - can grow for very long
periods without tending to slow down. The older model shows how lagging
countries can catch up by accumulating capital and copying the new
technologies developed elsewhere.
Statistical analysis of data from about 100 countries from 1960 to 1990
reveals a number of variables that influence the growth rate of real GDP per
head. The growth rate tends to be higher if the government protects property
rights, maintains free markets and spends little on non-productive
consumption. Also helpful are high levels of human capital in the forms of
education and health, and low fertility rates.
More public investment in infrastructure such as transport and
communications may be useful. But the present evidence indicates that
returns are typically no higher than those from private investment.
If two countries pursue similar policies, the country that starts with a
lower level of real GDP per head is likely to grow faster. In other words,
if a poor country can maintain good policies and accumulate a reasonable
level of human capital, then it tends to catch up with the richer countries
(as has happened with east Asian tigers such as South Korea and Taiwan).
However, countries are likely to remain poor if their governments distort
markets and fail to maintain property rights.
Overall, the new theory and empirical work on economic growth supports the
general thrust of the economic policies such as privatisation and
deregulation undertaken by the Tories during their long tenure in office.
Thus, it is all the more surprising that chancellor Clarke chooses to
ridicule this recent research with anti-intellectual jokes.
Even worse are the remarks of UK trade and industry secretary Michael
Heseltine, who apparently referred to endogenous growth as Balls, in a
reference to Edward Balls, Gordon Brown's economic adviser. I suppose that I
will never understand British humour.

If you have not seen The Crying Game, with which Channel 4 begins a new
season of 'Film Premiere', and if you still do not know about the twist in
the plot (I was taken entirely by surprise) it is worth watching. Not that
it is as good a movie as they thought in the US where it won the Oscar for
best screenplay. Americans confuse America's fight for independence with the
activities of Irish terrorists so that the IRA becomes a right-on
organisation on their side of the Atlantic. Still, this odd story of a black
soldier from the British Army who is held hostage by the IRA and asks one of
his captors to look after his lover back in London, does have an unusual
sense of style (10.00). The last episode in BBC2's likeable drama series
about mental patients, Takin' Over The Asylum (pity about that dropped 'g')
clashes with C4's superior culture series, Without Walls. Today this
includes an attack on television news values and what sounds like a
mick-take of 'The Late Show' (known here as 'The Night Show') where they are
trying to interview a chap called Shakespeare about one of his plays (9.00).

FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: The Romantic spirit revisited - Opportunities have
been missed in this rehang of German art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is usually nothing more tedious than to review a show twice, for all
that it might be currently the most brilliant thing in the world. But there
are exceptions, especially in those cases where doubts or questions were
raised by the initial experience. Autres temps, autres murs: a show rehung
is in many senses a new show, and to give such a one the benefit of those
doubts is no bad thing.
I first saw The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1770-1990 at Edinburgh in the
summer, and found it something less than the sum of its parts, fascinating
and beautiful though many of those parts undoubtedly were. It was a case, I
felt, of curatorial ambition over-reaching itself. Two hundred years'-worth
of any nation's art would be problem enough in the simplest chronological
presentation, let alone in the sustained exposition of a dense and complex
argument. What a brave idea it was and, in the event, what a frustrated
opportunity.
The move from the grand and ample Classical spaces of the Royal Scottish
Academy to the more tortuous and constricted plan of London's Hayward
Gallery, was bound to entail a certain concentration of material and
trimming down. Would it bring with it a refocusing of the show's essential
rationale, and with it a more comprehensive and integrated view of the
subject as a whole? Not at all.
Too late, of course, to expect that any of the more obvious and inexplicable
gaps would now be plugged (we knew there was to be no Beckmann, no Schad, no
Hubbuch, no Corinth, no Menzel) but surely some of the more obvious and
direct comparisons across the period, which the very premise of the
exhibition invites, would now be made - Beuys with Klee, Dix and Radziwill
with Rethel, Baselitz with von Marees and Bocklin, the Bauhaus practice with
the early theorisings of Goethe and Runge. Not a bit.
But scholars and curators are stubborn beasts, for whom any idee fixe is
fixe indeed. The bare fact is that not a single concession has been made, in
terms of editing or reconsideration, in what was manifestly the weakest part
of the Edinburgh showing. There the work of the last 30 years, represented
by a mere six artists, was shown apart in the Fruitmarket Gallery. At the
Hayward these same six have been given the entire mezzanine and the entrance
gallery, which must amount to nearly 30 per cent of the area available for
exhibitions. Small wonder then at what else has been left out.
What this says of the judgment and priorities of the organisers shouts for
itself. It is but the current orthodoxy that a room-size sculptural
installation by a Beuys or Polke must take precedence over any other
consideration, even in so historical a context as this. I would only say
that the showing on a sensible scale, and in a proper context, of Beuys,
Kiefer and Baselitz, would have been entirely justifiable. As it is they
stand with their three fellows as though there has been no other Deutsche
Romantik art in a generation - nothing of recent East German realism, for
example.
All that aside, the show holds many beautiful and rewarding things, albeit
fewer of them, from the Friedrich landscapes at the outset, so eloquent in
their gentle melancholy, to the abstracted, lively refinement of the Beuys
drawings at the end. The run of early 19th century self-portraits and small
paintings - Janssen stripped to the waist, Friedrich's wife leaning out of
the window, Kersting's pretty 'wreath-maker' sitting sad beneath the trees -
is a delight.
And what does all this tell us of the romantic spirit in German art in all
this time? That there was ever a soulful yearning for the ineffable, the
unreachable, the sublime? That the fond quest for purity and perfection took
with it, too, a more doubtful sense of destiny and foreboding? That in the
dark night of the soul, darker and more troublesome spirits walk abroad -
Bocklin's shaggy unicorn deep in the forest, Dix's ravens that tumble from
the winter sky? What quite does the nymph fear, in von Marees' painting,
from the horseman who turns away to pluck the fruit from the dark tree?
Such questions are proposed, but no answers offered. Some paintings of the
Nazi period are shown, but only a few, a mere gesture towards a subject that
by now requires proper treatment. Controversy flared briefly on the matter,
as though by Friedrich's noble yearners we might see that the enormities of
Hitlerian barbarism were inevitable. Nonsense, of course, in any particular
sense, but more general questions remain. What, if indeed it exists at all,
is this peculiar quality of national sensibility, this soulful,
contradictory agonising and self-searching, that distinguishes the German
from the Romantik of other kinds? This exhibition, over-ambitious yet
stretched as it is so thin, does little more than ask.
The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990: the Hayward Gallery, South Bank
Centre, London SE1, until January 8, then on to the Haus der Kunst, Munich:
sponsored by Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Urenco, with assistance from
Lufthansa: part of the South Bank's Deutsche Romantik Festival.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: British fanfare for Beethoven - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under orders to help promote new music, the London orchestras have each come
up with their own solution. The Philharmonia has introduced a series
entitled 'Music of Today' timed at 6pm before the evening's concert - a
clever idea, as it can draw on a captive audience, while leaving the
orchestra free to programme the standard classics in its main concerts.
So far the new music seems to have been concentrated on weekends. On
Saturday a reasonable number of Beethoven-lovers, gathering for the start of
the symphony cycle that night, was attracted to the earlier event: three
short pieces by British composers all in their mid-30s. An opening fanfare
was provided by James MacMillan. Then came Mark-Anthony Turnage's jazzy
romp, Release, and Steve Martland's Shoulder to shoulder, a more disciplined
exercise in post-Stravinskyan rhythmic battery. Each was a useful thumb-nail
sketch of its creator, though not more.
None of them will have stolen the thunder from Nikolaus Harnoncourt's
Beethoven cycle, which started its two-week journey that evening. For the
Philharmonia, which went down in history as the orchestra that marked the
Beethoven bicentenary with a symphony cycle under the revered Otto
Klemperer, this was quite a jump.
On the face of it Harnoncourt is the antithesis of everything Klemperer
stood for: a former standard-bearer of the 'authentic' brigade, tireless in
overturning accepted ideas, controversial, dynamic. His Beethoven with the
Chamber Orchestra of Europe, both live here in London and on record, has
made a name for itself with its drive and clarity. Teamed with the full-size
Philharmonia, Harnoncourt is able to replicate the drive, but the clarity
does not come so easily.
The First Symphony opened with two unexpectedly thick-sounding, heavy
movements. Then the scherzo and finale exploded with energy. 'Authentic'
Beethoven conductors - especially Norrington - have found a Haydn-like
humour in this early symphony, but as far as Harnoncourt is concerned,
Beethoven bursts forth fully-formed, a tempestuous symphonic composer
heading for battle.
The 'Eroica' is more Harnoncourt's piece. He relishes its determination to
fight until the issues are resolved. Some of the climaxes reached a high
pitch of intensity. Although there were rough patches of playing, one can
imagine Harnoncourt in rehearsal, knowing exactly what he wants and going
over every passage until he has stamped his authority on each note. His
Beethoven is entirely his own, which should make the rest of this cycle one
to recommend. In that respect he is as worthy a successor to Klemperer as
the Philharmonia could have found.
Beethoven symphony cycle at the Royal Festival Hall in London and Symphony
Hall in Birmingham until November 13.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: How to play second fiddle - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disarmingly, the great Itzhak Perlman's Barbican recital on Thursday began
not with a solo violin sonata, but with a keyboard sonata 'with violin
accompaniment'. That was Mozart's K296 in C, from the transition-period in
the late 1780s when composers were starting to imagine that a single violin
might actually do more than just accompany a harpsichord or piano.
It might have made too tame a start, or have seemed at best a relaxed way
for Perlman to play himself in. The result was quite different. The violin's
role is indeed subordinate to the piano's, and with the admirable Bruno
Canino at the latter instrument there was not the slightest chance that it
would dwindle against his 'accompaniment'. But Perlman gave us a miraculous
object-lesson in how to play second fiddle: never overweening, always
answering to the pianist - but rewarding him with the most subtle and richly
varied responses, even in the mostly 3-note descant of the Andante and his
scrubbing, clucking accompaniment in the Rondo.
The sonata acquired vital depths and breadth beyond anything one expected.
As it turned out, the real partner-sonatas that followed - Faure's op. 13,
his First, and Poulenc's only one - were less well balanced, though entirely
engaging. Perlman was faultlessly stylish and easy; Canino, whose pianism is
quick, light-fingered and very sparing with the damper-pedal (which Poulenc
loved to excess), sounded appreciative but distinctly spidery. There is as
much elan vital in Faure's sonata as in the famous First Piano Quartet that
came on its heels; here, we missed any real thrust from the bottom of the
keyboard, and therefore some of the sonata's radiant, importunate drive.
There was still plenty of art, as also in the Poulenc. The composer aimed to
write something that would do justice to Ginette Neveu's tigress-powers; but
tigerishness was never in his nature, and Neveu had to be content (we don't
know whether she was, but Poulenc himself was dissatisfied) with his
racketty, mercurial operetta-style in the outer movements, and measured
sentiment in the Intermezzo. Though Canino was again too wary to allow full
resonance to the piano-sound, everything he did was impeccably pointed - and
Perlman devoted himself to realising the exact character of every movement,
rather than exploiting their virtuoso potential.
On paper the programme looked short, and it was. Perlman was reserving a
surprise, however: after the Poulenc, without much feinting, he launched
briskly into five encore-size pieces - evergreen Sarasate, Kreisler and
Heifetz, haunting Faure and Stravinsky (the Berceuse and the little 'Chanson
russe'). We had to be delighted, and were almost satisfied.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: Olga Borodina sings Tchaikovsky - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Olga Borodina's all-Tchaikovsky programme at the Wigmore Hall on Thursday
launched the Maryinsky-Kirov series of recitals that will run there until
the middle of next year. Like the parallel Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra-Maryinsky series, also under the artistic directorship of the
Kirov's chief, Valery Gergiev, it is a celebration of St Petersburg's
cultural heritage, past and present.
On Thursday the 'present' was personified by Borodina, who along with the
soprano Galina Gorchakova (to appear later in the series) is a leading lady
of the Kirov Opera. In the space of a few years she has established herself
as one of the most exciting mezzo sopranos around today, not only in the
Russian repertory in which she excels; as her recent Cenerentolas at Covent
Garden testified, she is not an artist to be pigeon-holed.
Borodina possesses an individuality of voice all too rare among her
contemporaries. The sheer beauty of her tone was enough to hold the full
house rapt, in spite of the relatively unvaried programme. She has the
burnished Slavonic glint that distinguishes Russian singers, but nothing of
the 'edge' that can detract from some of them; she also boasts admirable
dynamic control, with wispy pianissimos and reserves of power.
Even so, the first part of her recital was a little short on communication:
perhaps she was relying too much on the lustre of her voice, but the dark
and wonderfully lugubrious sequence of songs needed greater definition.
'None but the lonely heart' - the most famous Russian song, ironically a
translation from Goethe - cried out for legato phrasing: even when notes
were joined, Borodina did not always seem to be thinking in long lines. She
redeemed herself with seamless legato in her first encore, Pauline's aria
from The Queen of Spades.
There was more variety to the second half of Borodina's programme -
virtually a repeat of the mezzo's recent recital disc for Philips - and she
found the mood of each number, helped by the flexible, fluent accompaniments
of Semyon Skigin (replacing the announced Larisaa Gergieva). The 'Gipsy
girl's song' was sultry, 'Gentle stars were shining for us' evocative; she
caught the bursting emotion of 'The first meeting' and the eroticism of 'The
sun has set'. Borodina put her all into the concluding 'Again, as before, I
am alone' - Tchaikovsky's last song, whose haunting strains reveal almost as
much about the composer's mental state during his final months as does the
whole of the Pathetique Symphony. Performances of this stature make the case
for Tchaikovsky as a major song composer, one which unfortunately still
needs arguing. His output of over 100 songs is undeserving of its continuing
and condescending neglect.
The Maryinsky-Kirov Series, sponsored by the Regent Hotel, London and
British Airways (St Petersburg), continues with recitals by Valentina
Sedipova (November 16) and Irina Arkhipova (November 24).

FT  01 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Pain-saving incentives - The latest
insolvency rules for partnerships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For many of the top commercial law firms the recent recession had little
impact on gross revenues. That has been particularly true for firms with
strong insolvency, banking and internationally based practices.
Inevitably, however, the economic downturn threw up its fair share of
casualties on both sides of the Atlantic. Some firms' troubles were more
public than others. In the US, Boston's Gaston &amp; Snow went to the wall. In
the UK, D J Freeman was one of the first to acknowledge publicly that it had
financial problems - difficulties which, by all accounts, are now behind it.
For others the pain is not yet over. Much has been written about the
problems of City law firm Turner Kenneth Brown and its failure to clinch a
merger with Alsop Wilkinson. And in the US last month, Lord Day &amp; Lord
Barrett Smith, one of New York's oldest law firms, dissolved its
partnership.
Rumours continue to circulate in London about the precarious financial
health of several well-known City law firms. But although many firms were
open about laying off staff during the recession, few are prepared to follow
D J Freeman's example and acknowledge financial difficulties in public.
That is understandable, says Mr Christopher Honeyman Brown of accountants
Binder Hamlyn. 'There is tremendous prejudice against professionals unable
to manage their affairs, to the extent that they get into a money muddle.
Accountants would certainly be discredited. Lawyers probably also,' he says.
Fear of publicity also appears to have prevented many firms from confronting
their financial difficulties and attempting to restructure. 'People do tend
to bury their heads in the sand, especially partnerships with problems. They
just hope they will go away,' says Mr Steve Hill of accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand.
Part of the reason why partnerships in financial trouble prefer to soldier
on rather than confront their problems is that, until now, they have had
little incentive to restructure.
When the 1986 Insolvency Act introduced new rescue procedures for companies
and individuals, partnerships were left out. But this gap, long criticised
by insolvency practitioners, is about to be filled.
On December 1, the Insolvent Partnerships Order 1994 will extend the rescue
culture to partnerships, allowing those in financial difficulty to make use
of voluntary arrangements and administration orders for the first time.
Under the old rules, an insolvent partnership could only be liquidated
compulsorily or wound up by the partners' trustee in bankruptcy. Therefore,
partnership rescues that have taken place tended to be through the use of
serial individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) for the partners.
Under an IVA, any individual owing money can propose a scheme to their
creditors to pay off their debts in whole or in part. For a voluntary
arrangement to be accepted, 75 per cent by value of the creditors need to
agree to it.
This procedure has been used successfully for some partnerships, says Mr
Hill. Serial IVAs were used for the partners of the London and Oxford
branches of UK accountants Halpern &amp; Woolf, now merged with Casson Beckman.
But in general they are too cumbersome for all but the smallest
partnerships.
'The Halpern &amp; Woolf case would probably have been easier, cheaper and
smoother under the new system,' he says.
According to Mr Chris Hughes, head of Coopers' insolvency practice, the new
law will make it easier to help medium and large partnerships, allowing some
to survive which would not have done so before. It will aid professional
partnerships such as solicitors, accountants and estate agents, where the
main asset of the business is the ability to earn future profits. Such
businesses are worth far more alive than dead, Mr Hughes says.
But he adds the courts should allow the use of IVAs for small partnerships
to continue, rather than force insolvency practitioners to use the panoply
of corporate procedures for the husband-and-wife corner shop. That would be
costly and of no benefit to creditors, he says.
Mr Hughes is also concerned by the Department of Trade and Industry's
insistence that partnerships should be treated in exactly the same way as
companies, so far as is possible. An administration order - an interim
arrangement to give a company protection from its creditors while it
reorganises (often combined with a voluntary arrangement whereby creditors
agree to compromise their claims) - does not provide any protection for
individual shareholders.
By implication, orders against partnerships will not provide any protection
for partners either. But, he says, shareholders do not need protection, as
they are not personally responsible for the companies' debts. Partners are,
however.
The other big change concerns the ranking of creditors. For more than 200
years, when a partnership has gone into liquidation or bankruptcy, each
partner's private creditors have to be paid in full before any of their
assets can be used to meet partnership debts.
From December 1, as recommended by the Cork Committee as long ago as in
1982, the deficit in a partnership will now be a claim in each partner's own
bankruptcy, and rank equally with the partner's private creditors.
Mr Hill says the effect of this change could be dramatic and private
creditors may no longer get paid in full. 'It means the local plumber is
going to have a lower chance of getting paid if he deals with a businessman
who is in partnership than he would if he dealt with a similar businessman
who is a company director,' he says.
So the new rule will favour creditors of the business over those of
individual partners. But, Mr Hill says, that may be the incentive needed to
keep the business alive. In the case of solicitors, where banks and
landlords tend to be the main creditors, it may help to persuade banks not
to pull the plug on financially troubled law firms.
Will the new procedures work or be much used? If they give a partnership
with a viable underlying business time to cut out dead wood, tighten cash
management and present itself as a suitable candidate for merger, then they
could prove valuable, says Mr Honeyman Brown.
Mr Hill says it is difficult to gauge how much use will be made of the new
rules. Insolvency practitioners are aware of several professional firms
still in some difficulty, so if the new procedures get positive results, 'we
may find, by demonstrating we have more strings to our bow, that we
encourage some partnerships to confront their financial problems and use the
new procedures to restructure'.
Others are not so convinced. Mr Alan Perry, a partner of D J Freeman, says
that any whisper of insolvency in a professional firm in the past has tended
to lead to the rapid collapse of the business. 'Apart from isolated cases, I
think the jury is still out on whether, and in what circumstances, a
substantial professional partnership could go through an administration or a
voluntary arrangement and survive,' Mr Perry says.
There is also the hint that, with the recession over, the timing of the
introduction of the new rules smacks of shutting the stable door after the
horse has bolted. Mr Hill is not sure that matters. 'There's definitely less
insolvency about. But that gives us plenty of time to de-bug it before the
next downturn.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Canary Wharf to appeal against TV
reception ruling - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Canary Wharf, the London Docklands development company, is to appeal against
a High Court ruling earlier this year in an action brought by a group of
Docklands residents claiming damages for interference with television
reception.
Canary Wharf maintains that interference with television reception should
not be an actionable nuisance under English law. If the ruling is allowed to
stand it could result in similar actions against existing developments, and
could threaten urban regeneration and city-centre developments, the company
says.
It says interference with television reception is analogous with loss of
view, citing an 1881 case that there is no right to a view under English law
otherwise 'there could be no great towns'.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Court rejects tractor appeals -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Court of First Instance has dismissed the appeals of three tractor
manufacturers against a 1992 European Commission decision condemning the UK
Agricultural Tractor Registration Exchange agreement.
The Commission said exchange of information on tractor registrations
infringed Treaty of Rome competition rules, because it resulted in an
exchange of information identifying sales of individual competitors, dealer
sales and imports.
The agreement concerned an information system based on UK Department of
Transport tractor registration data. In the UK, all vehicles must be
registered for use on public roads. Systematics International (SIL), a data
processing company responsible for processing and handling registration
application forms for the department, was permitted to send certain
information to the parties to the agreement.
The Commission said the information sent to members of the agreement could
be divided into three categories:
Aggregate industry information, including aggregate industry sales broken
down by year, quarter, month or week;
Information on each member's sales, including number of units sold by each
manufacturer and market share for various geographical areas; and
Information concerning sales made by dealers in each member's distribution
network, in particular imports and exports in their respective territories.
Until September 1988, parties to the agreement received part of the
registration application forms filed by independent importers from SIL.
Thereafter, the Commission said they continued to receive sufficient
information to enable parallel imports from other member countries to be
identified, mainly through the use of tractor serial numbers. Dealer
territories could be identified because the registration procedure required
customer postcodes to be given and the manufacturers defined territories by
postcode.
The eight agreement companies had about 87-88 per cent of the UK tractor
market, the Commission said. It refused exemption from the competition rules
largely because the information exchange system did not benefit consumers
but exclusively suppliers.
The Commission claimed it had never accepted either that exchanges of recent
and detailed information were indispensable to achieve the commercial
objectives of the members of the agreement or that such exchanges offer
advantages, in particular for third parties, which would compensate for
their restrictive effects on competition.
The CFI rejected the tractor manufacturers' arguments that the agreement did
not restrict competition or affect trade between member countries and, if it
did, it should have been exempted.
The Court said the provision of the information to all suppliers joining the
system presupposed an agreement, or a tacit agreement, between the parties
to define the boundaries of dealer sales territories by reference to the UK
postcode system, as well as an institutional framework enabling information
to be exchanged between the parties through their trade association
(Agricultural Engineers Association).
The Court said the frequency and systematic nature of the information also
enabled a trader to forecast more precisely the conduct of its competitors.
The Commission's decision was the first time it had prohibited an
information exchange system concerning a single-product market in the
absence of directly related anti-competitive conduct, such as price fixing.
However, the CFI confirmed the Commission had applied the same criteria it
always applied.
The CFI agreed with the Commission that in a narrow oligopolistic market,
where four companies had a dominant market share, the exchange of
confidential information restricted the hidden competition which would
otherwise exist in such a market and formed a barrier to new market
entrants.

Paddy Linaker, former managing director and deputy chairman of M&amp;G, the City
fund manager, is taking over as non-executive chairman of FISONS as from
yesterday.
He replaces Patrick Egan, 64, executive chairman, who in March signalled his
intention to step down and was known to have been keen to step down as soon
as a replacement was in place.
Stuart Wallis, 48, the chief executive since September, takes over executive
control of the company. His predecessor, Cedric Scroggs, was sacked in
December and the company since shed jobs and sold off some businesses.
Fisons says the changes are ere taking place with immediate effect because
'the handover to Wallis has gone exceptionally smoothly'.
Linaker, 60, joined the Fisons board in July as a non-executive director
after he left M&amp;G. He is also a non-executive director of the TSB Group.

FT  01 NOV 94 / People: Pru picks Sir Martin from its board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer and biggest
investment institution, is expected to announce shortly that Sir Martin
Jacomb, one of the City's best-connected merchant bankers, will take over as
its non-executive chairman following next May's annual general meeting.
The expected choice of Sir Martin, chairman of Postel Investment Management
and a director of the Bank of England, means that the Prudential is
reverting to its traditional habit of picking a chairman from its outside
non-executive directors.
Sir Brian Corby, 65, the current chairman, is unusual in that he joined the
Pru in 1952 and worked his way up to be group chief executive, before
becoming chairman in 1990. Sir Brian's two predecessors were Lord Hunt of
Tamworth, a former Cabinet Office secretary, and Lord Carr, who had been Sir
Edward Heath's Home Secretary in the early 1970s.
Although Sir Martin, who turns 65 next week, is a more traditional type of
insurance company chairman, he differs from his predecessors at the Pru in
having strong ties with the City. He worked as a barrister before joining
Kleinwort Benson in 1968 where he rose to be vice-chairman and was often
regarded as a contender for the chairman's post.
In 1985 he quit the family-dominated merchant bank and was appointed a
deputy chairman of Barclays Bank. He was the first chairman of Barclays de
Zoete Wedd and is credited with making BZW one of the more successful
merchant banking operations of the big clearing banks.
When he took on the chairmanship of the British Council in 1992 there was
speculation that Sir Martin was preparing to bow out of City life slowly. He
stepped down as deputy chairman of both Barclays Bank and Commercial Union
at the end of last year and his term as a Bank of England director expires
at the end of next February.
However, he joined the board of the Pru last March and retains a clutch of
non-executive directorships which include Marks and Spencer, RTZ, and The
Telegraph. He also took on the chairmanship of Delta last year and was last
week appointed to the Nolan committee set up to examine standards of conduct
in public life. (See Observer)

FT  01 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Price of turning green -
In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Chambers of Commerce estimates that businesses with up to 50
employees are spending up to Pounds 1.85bn a year between them complying
with environmental legislation. These costs are not being offset by
efficiency savings, according to Richard Brown, deputy director-general of
the BCC.
The estimate is drawn from a survey which shows that smaller companies are
turning greener because of legislation rather than market pressure.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): The cheque's in the wild
excuse - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
You have heard of the excuse that the cheque's in the post. But what about
'the cheque's in the goat'?
Pressed for payment, one South Wales engineering firm told the insistent
caller from a factoring service that its invoices and cheques books had been
eaten by a goat that had climbed into the building.
The story comes from Barclays Commercial Services, the factoring and invoice
discounting subsidiary of Barclays Bank, from a list of imaginative excuses
offered it in 30 years of collecting payments.
Other evasions included 'my managing director is abseiling down our building
for charity, can he call back tomorrow?', and 'I'm sorry no one can help
you, the accounts department are on a credit control course'.
Then there were the calls indicating all was not well: 'I'm sorry, the
finance director has taken the cheque book to pay the bail of the sales
director.'
The most outlandish excuse came from an independent financial adviser who
claimed that 'the building was ram-raided last night and our accounts
records are under a Ford Cortina in the front office'.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Business Link for London
 -The start of an umbrella advice organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greater London's 200,000 businesses are about to get their own Business Link
organisation after more than a year of acrimonious turf battles between the
agencies supposedly supporting them. To be precise, the capital is likely to
be getting 10 Business Links.
On November 23, a national assessment panel will review the first bid, for
Business Link London, which will act like its counterparts in England and
Wales as a one-stop shop providing advice and support services. Business
Link London will act as an umbrella over nine local Business Links
throughout the capital.
The case for a unified Business Link system bringing together the myriad
support agencies in the capital was forcefully articulated last week by Earl
Ferrers, the new minister for small businesses.
'In London there are 33 chambers of commerce, 26 local enterprise agencies,
nine training and enterprise councils, 32 local authorities and all the DTI
support services,' Lord Ferrers told the London Chamber. 'All of that can be
pretty daunting to a humble minister and one wonders if it is not pretty
daunting to the customers too.'
These 'customers' have not been uppermost in the minds of all support
networks as they shaped Business Link London. The partnership has been
fashioned against the wishes of a number of chambers of commerce, fearful
they might lose members and their raison d'etre. And some Tecs are only on
board after the DTI wielded a stick and refused to let them provide their
support services independent of a Business Link organisation.
One of the philosophical debates concerned whether London's Business Links
should be helping regenerate economically depressed areas, as some local
authorities wanted. Brian Wright, chief executive of the London Enterprise
Agency, says the opposite view has prevailed - that Business Links should be
concerned with supporting businesses with growth potential.
Irrespective of which organisations wither and which adapt, London's
businesses should have a clearer idea where to turn for advice by next July
when Business Link London hopes to open its doors.
As the proposals currently stand, the London-wide organisation will have
responsibility for those support areas where local duplication would not be
cost effective. So, the Business Link London will look after information
services and the new information technology network which will require
extensive investment. Specialised services, such as export support, will
also be organised centrally.
At the local level, the Business Links will look after the personal business
advisers who visit companies, assess their needs and refer the businesses to
a specialist. These local operations will also develop local specialities -
a knowledge of the rag trade in the east of London, for instance.
David Grayson, chairman of the national assessment panel for Business Links,
believes London's businesses will finally receive the kind of
customer-focused service they require if they are to be internationally
competitive.
One area that might suffer in Business Link's new world are start-up
companies and other micro-businesses; while there will be exceptions, the
Business Links network is targeting businesses with 10-200 employees.
Wright agrees this is potentially a problem. But he believes these companies
can be served by Local Enterprise Agencies.
This may be possible for organisations such as the London Enterprise Agency,
which are partly funded by private-sector sponsors and have freedom to
decide which start-ups to support.
But many Enterprise Agencies are dependent on funding from the government's
Enterprise Initiative programme and as a result mainly support businesses
started by the unemployed.
From next year, the budget for this initiative will disappear into the
government's new single regeneration budget for inner cities. Enterprise
Agencies recognise their start-up support programmes may receive meagre
rations from this pot.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Management (The Growing Business): All change at the factory
 -A DTI project to encourage innovation surprised companies with its success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Robin Enderby was phoned by the Department of Trade &amp; Industry to ask
if his company would take part in a pilot programme intended to encourage
innovation, he was sceptical.
'I detest red tape, bureaucracy, planning departments, consultants and
banks,' says Enderby, chairman of Blow Moulding Controls, a Gloucestershire
manufacturer employing nearly 50 people and with annual sales of Pounds 3m.
'I was very reluctant to get involved - I was the last guy in the world who
wanted to know about it.'
The DTI caller, Doug Ponsford, persuaded him that a company could be
transformed by the programme's method of managing continual and incremental
change. In consequence, Enderby's company was one of 12 in Gloucestershire
to participate in the pilot, Profit from Innovation, funded by the county's
training and enterprise council at a cost of nearly Pounds 50,000.
At a DTI-sponsored seminar in Cheltenham last month, Blow Moulding Controls
and five other companies reported back in such positive terms that the Tec,
probably in conjunction with two other south-west Tecs, will fund another
programme this month. It will also discuss teaching more trainers to expand
the regional coverage, and the DTI innovation unit will shortly consider
promoting the programme to Tecs on a national basis.
The subject of the enthusiasm is essentially a simple concept. It aims to
improve a company's competitiveness by involving its staff in identifying
the need for innovation, and then in implementing the necessary changes. It
was devised by Clive Jones of Mentra, an innovation management expert, and
Paul Ryan of the consultancy Business Logistix. Jones told the seminar: 'In
too many companies, change is an announcement from the managing director,
'As from tomorrow. . .'.'
The programme consists of six sessions to teach techniques to senior
managers on how to run staff workshops, followed by support visits to the
company. A 'driver' in each workshop encourages a flow of ideas to identify
threats and opportunities, while a 'scribe' uses flip charts to record these
and also keeps discipline.
Techniques include asking people to list all conceivable faults of a
product, and then stimulating suggestions for putting these right. Another
approach is to forecast 'supertankers' - such as social changes affecting a
market - and 'blockbusters' - described by Jones as 'a supertanker that
comes in a hurry'.
All this sounds sensible but is it effective? Enderby said the package
'seemed to boil down to one massive questioning technique'. It had decreased
his business's quality problems and increased profitability.
'By involving all the workforce, we had guys coming forward with lots of
ideas - some of them very good.' One outcome was that his company had
rethought its US marketing strategy.
Derek Morris, chairman of DM Foundries, with 25 staff and a turnover of
nearly Pounds 1m, had been as dubious as Enderby. 'We're plagued by
consultants who think they know it all. But we were amazed.' His foundry
worked in a difficult environment, in which many customers had gone bust,
and staff thought they were used to problem-solving. But the workforce came
up with 'tremendous' suggestions. In one example the cause of a rapid
production drop in one section was resolved.
AT Poeton, an engineering company with 100 employees and Pounds 3.5m sales,
also suffered in the recession. 'We made considerable efforts to find new
customers but we didn't do so fast enough,' Anthony Poeton, managing
director, says. 'Turnover dropped as did the profit to sales ratio.' The
package had made a tremendous difference. New markets had been identified
and profit to sales improved.
In contrast, success caused difficulties at Invertec, which makes transport
lighting equipment. Charles Valentine, managing director, said its sales of
Pounds 3m were up 100 per cent in two years. 'The main problem hit us
earlier this year when our order book exploded and we weren't ready for it.'
Invertec found the programme 'incredibly useful', he said. The company
realised it had poor communications with its customers and internally. 'We
needed to listen to what the shopfloor and junior management were saying. I
used to have a plaque in my office saying: 'As managing director I'm
entitled to my bigoted opinions.' I now listen to people and have thrown the
plaque away.'
One identified weakness was that Invertec's information technology was
'woefully poor'. The company was now investing in an integrated software
package. The 'supertanker' technique had helped to analyse other issues such
as the impact of transport air conditioning on its products.
Brian Bennett, managing director of Plastex International, a recycling
company with 35 people and a Pounds 5m turnover, said it too had rapidly
expanded. When his telephone call came from Ponsford, he said: 'I was
probably the most sceptical - I felt we didn't have time, and would it
really benefit us.' But in the workshops, he said, there were 'staggering
comments'.
The management discovered, for example, that staff did not feel motivated by
the bonus scheme - which has now been scrapped - and did not understand the
business. 'The techniques improved our ability to identify problems and make
decisions.' Productivity had risen and there was a different attitude by
both management and shopfloor.
Enderby voiced one concern, shared by others, about how to maintain the
initial enthusiasm. Jones acknowledged not all companies gained equally  -
for example, when management tried to institute big changes first, rather
than small changes where employees could see immediate results.
The attitude of the workforce was crucial. 'Some took to the programme
immediately,' he said, 'but a lot were very, very suspicious and almost
hostile. But once we started and the ice was broken, it went very well.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Technology: Healthy records / A look at a computer system
that helps doctors offer patients a better service - Software at Work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After 30 years as a general practitioner in Britain's National Health
Service, Michael Shapland is still developing new skills. He has to respond
to medical and pharmaceutical developments, to health service reforms and,
not least, to the demands of patients in his Oxford practice.
In Shapland's consulting room, a box of patient notes is on the desk next to
the computer, ready for afternoon surgery. His computer is a standard PC,
but it supports a system called Horizon, which runs the practice.
Shapland still uses paper records but patients coming into his room are
likely to find their records on screen. These can be updated with any
information, such as about a smoking habit, that has changed since their
last visit. Referrals or other relevant details are also in the system.
Shapland's portable laptop computer is a vital source of information on
emergency visits. The data it holds on pharmaceuticals and prescriptions
alone forms a vast database, including all the generic and proprietary drugs
in the GP's compendium.
Unlike most software built for GPs, the 'intelligence' built into Horizon
cross-references any drug to the individual patient, alerting the
prescribing doctor (who may not be the patient's usual physician) to
allergies, side-effects, or reactions to other medication. The combination
of warfarin with aspirin, for example, throws up an alarm: both drugs thin
the blood, in different ways.
The system also deals with administration, including statistical returns to
the Family Health Services Authority and repeat prescriptions for the 4,500
patients cared for at the Donnington Health Centre, where Shapland's
practice is based. Three practices share the centre, along with its nurses
and other clinical resources.
Horizon's unusual dynamic facility means the the system can 'learn' from
changes in a pattern. For example, it can note the sudden popularity of a
newly-prescribed drug, and add it to the list it presents as optional
treatments for a particular condition.
This artificial intelligence, known as a neural network (because it mimics
the way the human brain makes connections), makes the system attractive to
researchers and hospital clinicians, who make up the majority of Horizon's
100 or so users worldwide. The system is available in several languages.
In Switzerland, Horizon is used for reporting on epidemiological studies and
for microbiological research. Kurt Eggenberger, a paediatrician in private
practice in Yverdon, outside Lausanne, uses the system in his own clinic,
and for research into viral and respiratory infections in children, working
with research groups in Geneva. 'Nothing else I have found can carry out
such versatile clinical analysis, and report on disease occurrence in this
way,' he says.
At their Oxford practice, Shapland and his partner David Thurston cover
areas including Littlemoor and the Blackbird Leys estate, where there have
been big job cuts in the car industry.
'Unemployment has caused some hardship. The computer doesn't improve your
gut feel after 30 years here, but it enables you to analyse it and produce
real figures to prove your case,' says Shapland.
Thurston says Horizon has helped with his special interest in psychology.
For example, an analysis of suicide rates showed him that of 65 intentional
overdose cases, more than half were aged between 14 and 30. Nearly twice as
many of them were female as male, about 15 per cent are unemployed, and a
high percentage live on the Blackbird Leys estate.
A seasonal pattern emerged: extremes of weather trigger an upturn in suicide
attempts. 'Things that may not seem obvious become significant as you play
with the data,' says Thurston. 'Once you have spotted a pattern, you can do
something about it, like monitoring vulnerable patients more carefully in
July and January.'
The system also enables the practice to verify its targets under National
Health Service reforms. These include preventative measures, such as checks
on people over 75 years old, immunisation for infants, and cervical smears.
Targets are based on percentages: a 50 per cent reach for cervical smears
earns less for the GP than the government's 70 per cent target. Scaled
payments to GPs are based on performance.
Shapland also runs clinics for asthmatics and diabetics. With a few
keystrokes, he shows a list of asthma patients and a graphic breakdown, by
age, showing the percentage of the 255 sufferers that are in the toddler to
teenage range.
It was this complexity and power, coupled with simple access, that impressed
Shapland when he saw the Horizon system at a medical computer show in 1989.
'I realised I wouldn't have to lose my staff for endless weeks of training
because this system tells them what to do as they are doing it.'
Horizon replaced a Meditel system, in use since 1986. It operates on four
linked - or networked - 286 PCs. The system sells on a 'turnkey' basis with
hardware, software and support in a provided package by the Leicester-based
developer Horizon Software. It costs the practice Pounds 3,000 a year on a
lease basis, plus a Pounds 1,600 yearly maintenance charge.
Linda Gardner, the practice manager, sees time-saving as the greatest
advantage. 'It's invaluable for the annual statistics we have to return
every June,' she says. 'You could never plough through all the notes by
hand, but we can analyse our patients' records from any angle, which is
invaluable.'
Horizon users can access records by patient name or names, or addresses,
useful where a family has several surnames under one roof. There is a record
of medication, whether the patient lives alone, and a notes section for any
extra information. Drugs and diseases are coded for quick access and
analysis, so that users rarely have to type in complex names.
For the sector as a whole, Shapland believes the NHS has taken a piecemeal
approach to computerisation, slowing the move towards umbrella systems that
would enable GPs and hospitals to exchange information via computers and
telephone-linked networks. Not one UK hospital, in his opinion, has a really
good all-embracing system in place.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Technology: Cast in a new strength / A look at a method of
reinforcing ceramics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH SHAPLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clay has been fired into many different objects since ancient times. But
even the loveliest Greek urns were of limited use because ceramics, although
hard, chemically stable and heat resistant, lack toughness. Ancient urns did
not corrode as they lay under the sea or buried on land, but they broke, so
that archaeologists often find them as pieces.
Modern science has improved on the ancient clays, but in manufacturing,
ceramics are still passed over for metals which are rarer and more costly
but stronger.
Aluminium does not oxidise, or rust, under normal conditions. But it can be
oxidised into hard, irregular blobs when it becomes molten, under certain
conditions in a furnace. In aluminium smelters these are sometimes found as
coral-like growths along furnace walls. Furnaces have to be shut down while
the blobs are drilled off. That is the rub: the oxidised aluminium is
transformed into a tough ceramic.
In the 1970s, Marc Newkirk, a young engineer working in his father's
furnace-making business in New England wondered if this natural growth could
be directed to produce the ultra-strong ceramics long sought by science.
Newkirk created the Lanxide Corporation in 1983. Today it makes items for
industries including electronics, steel processing, mining, semiconductors,
sports and automotive. The group is capitalised at Dollars 350m (Pounds
219m) and sales in fiscal 1994 were Dollars 20m. Its partners include Alcan
and Du Pont.
Lanxide's work, presented in Washington recently at a symposium* on
materials, is one of the leading US advances in ceramics.
Newkirk first directed the oxidised aluminium growth through ceramic fibres,
making a ceramic version of fibreglass. He then tried to make blocks of
cheaper reinforcing material such as silicon carbide, placing them next to
the aluminium and heating both. He discovered that the hot aluminium
oxidised into and through the reinforcing material, filling all pores like a
glue.
When cooled, the block of silicon carbide had become a reinforced ceramic,
with particles dispersed throughout, strengthening it uniformly.
Coatings for the reinforced materials were discovered that stopped the
oxidation process at the boundary. These processes opened the way for
large-scale, cheap production of tough ceramic items in very precise shapes.
By varying the reinforcing material and metal (titanium works, too),
'engineered ceramics' can be produced to pre-determined weight and strength.
The second important invention came from a failed experiment, when a Lanxide
inventor heated aluminium next to a ceramic preform in an atmosphere of
nitrogen instead of air. The metal failed to oxidise. Instead it shot
quickly into the adjoining ceramic. This proved to be a remarkably simple
way to make a ceramic-reinforced aluminium.
Among many objects, Lanxide now casts avionics chassis for US military
aircraft in a single piece, which are a third the weight of ordinary
aluminium chassis - the reinforced material is actually heavier, but because
it is stronger, it can be crafted into much smaller components.
Lanxide spins off applications of its core processes into separate
businesses with partners who bring resources and experience.
Alcan of Canada was Lanxide's first important partner, Alanx, makes pumps
and ceramic 'chokes' that link pipes carrying slurry from mines, which the
company says last eight times longer than standard ceramic pipe chokes. In
Japan, Lanxide and Kanematsu formed Klanxide KK, as the focus of future
business there. 'Talks are under way' with possible European partners, adds
Newkirk.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Technology: Making a costs diagnosis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Patients in the UK are getting used to seeing a computer on their doctor's
desk. Eighty per cent of general practices in Britain have a computer to
help manage patient records.
While some sorts of data have always been demanded by authorities - on the
occurrence of certain diseases, for example - additional requirements have
resulted from the cost-conscious reforms of the 1980s. The NHS had formerly
required few costs measurements, and doctors were inexperienced in
'budgeting' patient care and drug costs. Almost overnight, a new market for
software suppliers appeared, selling systems to doctors who were novices at
both computers and business administration.
Doctors suddenly had to monitor costs, especially prescription expenses, an
exercise that would have been impossible based purely on paper-based notes.
Many doctors installed their first systems in the late 1980s, aware of an
increasing need to measure drug-related costs, and other resources used by
patients. The two most widely sold systems, Vamp Health (2,000 sites) and
AAH Meditel (1,289 sites), were both developed by British companies that
were acquired by pharmaceuticals companies.
The recent emphasis on preventative medicine has put extra tasks on the
doctors' agenda. Their pay levels are now linked to fulfilling preventative
duties, including immunisation, cervical smears and check-ups on the
elderly. Doctors must be able to satisfy their local Family Health Service
Authority that they have achieved set percentages of their patient quota to
qualify for performance-related pay.
Practices can now apply for fundholder status, which allows doctors a budget
for patient care, and gives them control of how it is allocated. To qualify
for fundholder status, doctors must be able to deliver the appropriate
statistics, which means computerisation must take place at least a year
beforehand.
GP fundholders get all software expenses and 75 per cent of hardware costs
reimbursed by the FHSA. Non fundholders get up to half of entire system
costs, including maintenance.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Mersey area set for Pounds 176m aid fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 176m package of European Union and UK public and private sector
spending on 780 projects to start reviving Merseyside's economy will be
announced today. More than 400 projects were rejected.
The money is part of a Pounds 1.6bn six-year programme, underpinned by
Pounds 630m of EU grants. Merseyside is entitled to special 'Objective One'
funds because its output per head is less than 75 per cent of the EU
average.
The Pounds 176m - made up of Pounds 75m each from the European Commission
and UK public sector and Pounds 26m from industry and commerce - will go to
provide 25,000 training places, 3,900 new jobs and 341,000 sq ft of modern
industrial space, as well as preparing 291 acres of land ready for
development.
Fifty-six per cent of the EU grants will go to regional development with the
rest going to social funds, a marked shift from government proposals earlier
this year which would have used most of the money for social purposes such
as training.
Projects include:
A Pounds 43m programme to improve industrial estates at Haydock on the M6,
Kirkby on the M57 and in Bootle, Liverpool, Birkenhead and Wirral. A grant
of Pounds 1m will help fund an initial Pounds 2.78m campaign by a
partnership of local authorities, universities, colleges, industry and
commerce to improve Merseyside's poor image.
A grant of Pounds 3m for the port of Liverpool to improve facilities and
speed up access to the docks.
More than Pounds 4m to be spent on Queen's Square, an area of Liverpool city
centre blighted by abandoned property development schemes.
Pounds 2.5m to improve 'Atlantic Avenue', the A565 trunk road linking
Liverpool, the docks at Bootle and the coastal towns of Crosby, Formby and
Southport.
An initial Pounds 100,000 to help establish a fund to support new products
and processes among small and medium-sized enterprises. Training and
enterprise councils will run a Pounds 4m scheme to assist business
start-ups. The initial target is 1,300 new businesses.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Heseltine has to deliver the back benches: Andrew Adonis
says the cabinet has yet to be convinced of the merits of a Post Office
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week could see the final act in the long-running saga of government
dithering about the future of the Post Office.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has to convince his
cabinet colleagues that he can carry Tory backbenchers in support of
privatisation. If he fails - as appears increasingly likely - then a year of
preparatory work may have been in vain.
If the status quo continues it will be partly as a result of the fears
raised by opponents of privatisation.
But it will also be a consequence of the government's failure to give
serious consideration to the 'middle way' option of granting the Post Office
full commercial freedom in the public sector.
The government is looking at such an option, but has spent the last four
months deriding it as impractical.
The government tried to meet many of the concerns raised by opponents of
privatisation in its consultation paper published in July.
A Labour party leaflet delivered across north London at the weekend says
that the government's plans 'will lead to local post offices facing closure,
an increase in the price of stamps and cuts in postal deliveries'.
In fact, under government plans the Post Office's counters division - which
is responsible for high street and village post offices - will remain in the
public sector. So the future of post offices - urban or rural - would be a
matter for the government if they appeared to be under threat.
As for the price of stamps, the latest increase - 1p on first and second
class letters last November - followed a sharp increase in the Treasury's
levy on the nationalised industry's profits.
Last year the Post Office had to pay the Treasury Pounds 182m. This year it
is Pounds 226m, a sum higher than the Post Office's post-tax profit for
1993-94 and nearly twice as much as a reasonable dividend payment if the
industry were in the private sector.
The government is also proposing to establish a postal regulator to ensure
that price increases are justified by costs. Oftel, the regulator of the
privatised telecoms industry, is imposing sharp price cuts on British
Telecommunications - whose charges are substantially less, in real terms,
than they were at privatisation a decade ago.
It is arguable that the government's proposal to split the counters division
from the Royal Mail will make rural and high street post offices more
vulnerable than they are now. Some critics have called for more detailed
regulation. The government could offer further guarantees on both fronts.
But as one Tory MP put it yesterday: 'Unfortunately, such adjustments don't
really matter. The fears our opponents are deploying so successfully would
not be reduced.'
He added: 'The experience of water privatisation, which remains bitterly
unpopular and probably should not have gone ahead, has not helped.'
The government could still, however, call the Labour party's bluff and
propose to give the Post Office full commercial freedom in the public
sector.
Mr Bill Robinson, a former adviser to Mr Norman Lamont when chancellor, has
set out such a course in a paper for the consultancy London Economics. He
says that privatisation of the Post Office will not necessarily make it more
efficient, and criticises the government for not looking hard enough at the
case for a publicly-owned future for the Post Office.
Having examined previous privatisations, London Economics concludes:
'Privatisation itself is not a fundamental driver of efficiency improvement.
Competition, effective regulation and a determination to restructure the
business when necessary matter more.'
The Treasury has until now been resolutely opposed to granting the Post
Office full commercial freedom in the public sector - however categoric the
statutory and regulatory safeguards.
The Treasury justifies its stance by citing rules on the compilation of the
public accounts, and by arguing that a public-sector company could not, in
practice, be allowed to float free while the government acted as ultimate
guarantor for its debts.
Mr Robinson cited the cases of New Zealand and Sweden, where state-owned
postal services have been granted full commercial freedom and are
flourishing.
He said: 'It would be a major new departure in Britain, and the Treasury
fears it would open the floodgates. But there isn't much else left in the
public sector to come flooding through.'
The Post Office has in any case been run for years as a profitable
commercial organisation.
It now faces 'the worst of all possible worlds', as one senior Post Office
executive put it. Having dissipated its energies on a politically impossible
privatisation scheme the government might simply leave the Post Office where
it is.
'And that does nothing to meet our original concerns about survival in an
increasingly competitive market,' he said.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Mayhew acts over 'IRA roadblock'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday called for a
report from the Royal Ulster Constabulary on reports that armed and masked
men purporting to be from the IRA mounted checkpoints on roads in
Londonderry at the weekend, Stewart Dalby writes.
If the reports are true they could have a bearing on the timing of talks
between British government officials and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, on how Sinn Fein might enter peace negotiations.
However, the RUC said: 'We have only had one anonymous phone call saying he
saw someone with a gun. Several people said they saw masked men. But we are
now inclined to think this was the work of Hallowe'en pranksters.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Council reform faces further setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Plans to abolish five county councils are likely to be abandoned after NOP
public opinion surveys revealed strong hostility to change.
But Herefordshire and Worcestershire, merged in the 1974 local government
reorganisation, now seem certain to be split again.
Last week the Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham,
abandoned plans to replace six county councils with all-purpose unitary
authorities after opposition in the surveys.
The cross-party Association of District Councils, which backs unitaries,
said the commission had put too much emphasis on the surveys. Low turn-out
figures demonstrated widespread ignorance, it said.
The survey results published yesterday were:
Hereford &amp; Worcester: A unitary Herefordshire received overwhelming support.
Fifty-nine per cent supported a two-tier system for Worcestershire. Turnout
was 17 per cent.
Nottinghamshire: The single most popular option was to make no change at
all, favoured by 38 per cent. Turn-out was 12 per cent.
Staffordshire: A new unitary combining Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under
Lyme was most popular, with 45 per cent support. Turnout was 12.67 per cent.
Surrey: Keeping the status quo was favoured by 77 per cent of respondents,
with only 19 per cent backing the commission's original preferred option of
splitting the county into five unitaries. Turnout was 12.5 per cent.
Warwickshire: Only 20 per cent backed the commission's preference for two
unitaries. Turnout was 13.2 per cent.
Wiltshire: Making Thamesdown, centred on Swindon, a unitary had virtually no
opposition. Outside Thamesdown 60 per cent favoured the status quo. Turnout
was 10 per cent.
The commission is expected to make final proposals next month.

FT  01 NOV 94 / BT plans 50% reduction in personnel staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is cutting nearly 50 per cent of its 4,000
personnel staff as part of its shake-up.
A large part of the cut will come in the areas of training and general
administration.
Some less specialist training functions will be contracted out and line
managers will take on more personnel functions.
Under the reorganisation, known as Break-out, different parts of BT test
their contribution to the company and assess whether it would be more
effective for their function to be contracted out.
Mr Peter Archer, head of personnel at BT, said: 'We thought for a long time
that we should be able to run at about half of our current size.
We then had extensive discussions with our internal customers about what
they wanted from us and what they were prepared to pay for, and we have
decided that a cut of between 40 per cent and 50 per cent is about
appropriate.'
He said that specialist training would remain in-house but 'generic'
training, such as welding or computer skills, could be done more effectively
by external trainers.
The personnel function has played a leading role in the reduction in BT's
employee numbers to 148,000 from 230,000 in 1990.
The company has said it will seek to avoid compulsory redundancies for both
managerial and non-managerial staff and so far it has succeeded in doing so.
It said that exactly the same rules would apply to employees in the
personnel area.
The Society of Telecom Executives, the main union representing managers, is
not happy about the way in which personnel numbers are being slimmed.
Union officials fear that if more personnel functions are devolved to line
managers national uniformity in terms and conditions will be eroded.
BT has said that it is keen to retain national rules on issues such as pay
and redundancy procedures but union officials said that there is a growing
tension between the centre and the divisions.
Mr Archer said: 'There will be some tension but I think it is generally a
healthy one. The personnel function may have been too dominant in some
areas.'
Union officials said that the recent dispute between the company and the NCU
communications union over the customer service improvement programme -
designed to introduce more flexible shift patterns - showed the sort of
tensions arising in the company.
The NCU said it reached a compromise with the company's industrial relations
specialists but found the agreement undermined by operational directors.

FT  01 NOV 94 / ITV urges division of activities at BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The independent television network has expressed concern about the potential
conflict between the BBC's status as a publicly-funded body and its
commercial interests.
Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of both the ITV Association and Central Television,
said the association had stressed the need for the BBC to have 'a genuinely
arm's length relationship between its public service activities and
increasing commercial activities'. The concern was voiced in response to the
white paper on the BBC.
The paper recommended that the BBC should retain its status as a public
service broadcaster while expanding its commercial activities.
The ITV companies welcomed the decision that the BBC should continue to be
funded chiefly by the licence fee, but warned of the need for transparency
in its accounting procedures and activities such as programme sales.
The Independent Television Commission will today invite applications for the
Channel 5 licence. The licence was last advertised in 1992 but attracted
only one bid.

The Office of Fair Trading has welcomed a Royal Mail plan to introduce a
scheme to assist independent producers of first-day covers, Michael
Skapinker writes.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said the plan followed
talks between the OFT and the Royal Mail after independent producers
complained about how much they had to pay for stamps.
Mr Anthony Buckingham, managing director of Benham, an independent first-day
cover producer in Folkestone, Kent, said he had complained to the OFT that
Royal Mail was charging almost the face value of the stamps.
Mr Buckingham said the Philatelic Bureau, Royal Mail's in-house operation,
had to pay only the production cost of stamps for its covers.
Sir Bryan said the Royal Mail would introduce a scheme to enable independent
producers to claim a rebate on stamps affixed and cancelled on their
first-day covers.
He added: 'I understand the Royal Mail will be consulting the independent
producers about the handling of their first-day cover business with a view
to introducing a rebate scheme early in the new year.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Daily Mail group to bid again for Midlands titles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Daily Mail &amp; General Trust is to try to find a compromise solution to
overcome the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's objections to its Pounds
92m bid for the T. Bailey Forman newspaper group.
The MMC said yesterday that it was opposed to DMGT's bid for Bailey Forman,
which owns the Nottingham Evening Post and is one of the UK's biggest
family-owned regional newspaper groups.
The commission said that the bid could act against the public interest by
giving DMGT too high a concentration in the east Midlands area. It already
owns the nearby Leicester Mercury and Derby Evening Telegraph daily papers
through its Northcliffe Newspapers subsidiary.
The Department of Trade and Industry suggested a compromise could be struck
to allow DMGT to pursue the bid while allaying the MMC's concerns. It has
given DMGT until December 5 to produce acceptable proposals.
Mr Peter Williams, finance director of DMGT, said: 'We've spent six months
working on this. It's our first significant acquisition in regional
newspapers for 20 years . . . and we'll be working very hard with the DTI to
find a solution.'
The Bailey Forman group was put up for sale this summer in an auction
organised by BZW, the merchant bank. DMGT won the auction against
competition from rival publishers including Emap and Midland Independent
Newspapers.
The Daily Mail group was criticised in the newspaper industry for the scale
of its Pounds 92m bid for Bailey Forman, which was significantly higher than
trade estimates of the company's value. DMGT also plans to invest heavily in
modernising the Bailey Forman titles if the bid goes through.
If DMGT fails to satisfy the MMC the other auction participants - which also
included Reed International and Thomson Regional Newspapers - are expected
to renew their bids for Bailey Forman.
Express Newspapers plans to print the Scottish Daily Express and the
Scottish edition of the Daily Star in Glasgow at DC Thompson's printing
plant. The two papers will then be able to increase their coverage of
Scottish news and sport.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Milk price rises swiftly: First day of deregulation sees
some doorstep deliveries up 2p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Deregulation of the milk market has already hit consumers with an increase
of 2p per pint in some doorstep deliveries yesterday and a similar rise
today in some supermarkets.
Tesco, the supermarket group, announced that a pint of fresh milk would go
up by 2p, or 7.7 per cent, to 28p because of the rise in the cost of raw
milk resulting from the new marketing arrangements which take effect today.
It said it would keep cheese price increases to 5 per cent in spite of a 20
per cent rise in wholesale milk prices to cheese makers. British cheddar
will rise shortly by 10p a pound to Pounds 2.05 and butter by about 8p a
pound in a few weeks' time.
Tesco blamed the increases on 'inflationary pressure' caused by the new
marketing system, which sees the abolition of the statutory Milk Marketing
Board and its replacement by a voluntary producers' co-operative, Milk
Marque.
The dairy trade, which plans to complain to the competition authorities in
London and Brussels, says Milk Marque, with 66 per cent of supplies in
England and Wales, is abusing its monopoly position by pushing up wholesale
prices sharply.
However, Mr William Waldegrave, agriculture minister, said yesterday there
was no justification for retail price increases of 2p or more on a pint of
milk as a result of deregulation.
'I suspect that some dairy companies have been preparing price rises which
are unrelated to the cost of milk and are seeking to blame these on the
changes,' he said.
Deregulation nevertheless continued to attract fierce criticism yesterday,
with the Safeway supermarket group saying the changes 'could be catastrophic
for some UK dairy product manufacturers', jeopardising jobs and leading to
more imported dairy products.
'Although we will continue to buy British where it is commercially sensible,
we fear continental producers will become more competitive on price in some
product areas', it warned. Safeway expects to raise prices by 2p to 3p a
pint.
The Labour party said the survival of the doorstep pint was under threat.
'The government's plans will be bad for ordinary families, as the price of
milk and dairy products goes up,' said Mr Gavin Strang, agriculture
spokesman.
Unigate, which delivers to 1.6m households in south and south-west England,
raised its prices yesterday by 2p a pint to 40p. It said this covered higher
wages and packaging costs and two previous raw milk price rises, as well as
higher costs associated with deregulation, which had triggered the overall
increase.
The government argues the new system will lead to a shake-out of excess
capacity devoted to low-value commodity products such as butter and skimmed
milk powder. This will create a more efficient industry and benefit
consumers in the longer run by reducing Britain's reliance on high
value-added dairy imports, it says.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Prices index hints at inflation rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further hints of rising price expectations and a slow-down in the rate of
manufacturing growth were revealed in a business survey yesterday.
The prices component of the Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 70.2 per cent
in October from 70.1 per cent in September, as the overall index fell to
58.3 per cent from a seasonally adjusted 60.5 per cent last month. Any
figure above 50 per cent indicates growth from the previous month.
The prices index was above 70 per cent for the fourth consecutive month, and
was particularly affected by upward pressures on general commodity prices.
The most significant price rises were seen by purchasers of plastics,
chemicals and various types of paper and steel.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply, which commissions the
survey, said the drop in the overall index was largely attributable to a
fall in the rate of growth in the output index, which eased to 59.3 per cent
from 64.3 per cent in September.
Although the rise in the prices index in October was marginal, analysts said
it suggested incipient inflationary pressures.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The index is
much higher than the readings earlier this year or last year.'
Almost every other component in the overall index, which is compiled from
data on stocks, output, orders, delivery times and prices, registered only
slight changes from the previous month.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Banks seek to counter EU rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leading City investment banks fear a European Union directive aimed at
cushioning securities firms against shocks in the financial system will
force them to hold more capital than competitors in other countries.
They are asking the Treasury to interpret the Capital Adequacy Directive,
which takes effect in January 1996, in a manner which will allow some firms
to hold less capital than that required by Brussels.
Mr Kit Farrow, director-general of the London Investment Banking
Association, whose members are the City's biggest firms, said: 'These issues
are particularly acute for London, given the nature of the business here.
'It is in the UK where the trading activity is more developed. Even
Continental banks tend to run their trading books out of London. It may not
be very difficult for them to book the business elsewhere rather than in
London.'
London firms have been particularly critical of the directive, which they
say reflects a political compromise between member states where securities
industries vary greatly. It is understood to have been heavily influenced by
German universal banks, which typically have much more capital than is
required by regulators and which do not take large trading positions.
The directive says the 'trading book' of an investment bank should be
separated from the 'banking book', with a more liberal regime applying to
the former. Current UK rules do not make such a distinction and view the
risk activities of investment banks in their entirety.
In particular, the association is concerned about the directive's rules
which, unlike those applied by UK securities regulators, do not lower the
capital requirements for firms with diversified portfolios. Also, the
directive does not reduce capital requirements for holding securities which
offset each other's risks.
The association today will receive a boost from publication of the Bank of
England's quarterly report, which is highly critical of the directive. The
article, by Professor Richard Dale of Southampton University, does not
represent the view of the Bank.
Yet The Bank will release its own interpretation of how the directive will
apply to the securities activities of banks later this month.
Prof Dale says: 'The idea of segregating one part of a bank's business - its
securities trading operations - and applying separate and distinct
definitions of capital and capital adequacy to the different parts, appears
to make little prudential sense.'
He says the directive encourages banks to use their deposit base to
subsidise their riskier securities activities, giving the securities
activities of universal banks an advantage over non-bank securities firms.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Start-up boost for Scottish business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banks in Scotland are to offer small businesses medium-term loans with a
rate of interest which will not rise by more than 1 per cent, under a scheme
backed by Scottish Enterprise, the official development body.
The scheme, launched yesterday by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, is unique
in the UK and is said to be the only one of its kind in Europe.
The small business loan scheme will make Pounds 100m available in the next
two years on a pilot basis. The money will be advanced for up to seven years
by any of the four Scottish clearing banks, with the interest rate being
guaranteed by Scottish Enterprise.
The scheme is one of several initiatives by the enterprise board under a
strategy to remedy the low level of business formations in Scotland.
Research showed that people were deterred from creating businesses or
expanding existing ones by fears of volatile interest rates.
Surveys found that many small businesses either did not borrow or financed
their companies through overdrafts, which the banks could terminate at short
notice.
The new scheme, which involves the Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland,
TSB Bank Scotland and the Clydesdale Bank, will be available only to new and
growing companies employing fewer than 250 people in manufacturing,
construction - excluding property development - and business services.
The loans should be used for spending on capital equipment, expanding
markets and developing new products or services. There will be a limit of
Pounds 500,000 per transaction with Pounds 2.5m per business and a minimum
level of Pounds 20,000.
Scottish Enterprise will arrange insurance of the interest rate charged on
the loans and expects the scheme to cost it about Pounds 5m. It had to
overcome opposition from the Treasury.
Companies will approach banks after being vetted by their local enterprise
companies. Scottish Enterprise officials expect there will be demand for a
similar scheme in England and Wales.
Mr Bruce Pattullo, governor of the Bank of Scotland, who conceived the
scheme with Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, said:
'The problem for the newly formed business is to survive the first economic
cycle, when order books drop and interest rates rise.'
The banks hope the scheme will lead to longer-term relationships. But the
scheme's Pounds 100m is small compared with between Pounds 3bn and Pounds
4bn per year which Scottish banks lend to small and medium-sized businesses.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Speedy growth in money supply causes concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The narrow measure of the money supply last month grew at its fastest annual
rate since January 1989, causing increased concern about inflation and the
prospect for further increases in interest rates.
M0 rose by a seasonally adjusted 7.3 per cent in the 12 months to October
and by 0.5 per cent over the month, according to figures released by the
Bank of England yesterday.
The less volatile notes and coins component grew 0.4 per cent between
September and October and 7.1 per cent over the 12 months.
In both cases seasonal adjustment factors were entirely responsible for the
monthly rise. In unadjusted terms M0 and notes and coins were unchanged
between September and October.
Nevertheless, the Bank of England, which issues its latest inflation report
today, is likely to be concerned at the continued strength of M0, which
remains stubbornly above its monitoring range of between zero and 4 per
cent.
In its August inflation report the Bank said: 'If M0 growth remains at its
present rate throughout the rest of the year, concerns over future inflation
would increase.'
At that time the annual growth rate of M0 was 6.5 per cent, lower than its
current level. The report noted that 'in the past, increases in the growth
of M0 have tended to lead to increases in inflation'.
M0, which includes banks' operational deposits as well as notes and coins,
is seen as a rough guide to activity in the high street, since higher
consumer spending is linked with the need for more cash. But some have
explained the recent strength of M0 by pointing to low interest rates, which
have reduced the effective cost of holding cash.
In contrast to M0's strength the broad measure of money supply growth - M4 -
has remained close to the lower end of its monitoring range of between 3 per
cent and 9 per cent. This leads some monetarist economists to argue that
there is little immediate danger of inflation.
The growth rate of M0 is likely to be a discussion point when Mr Eddie
George, the governor of the Bank of England, meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, tomorrow. Some analysts expect the governor to
press for an increase in base rates.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Farmers fight National Grid over pylon upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today sees the start of a marathon of public hearings at which National Grid
Company is fighting landowners and farmers over the biggest upgrading of
Britain's electricity grid network since the 1950s.
The government has given National Grid approval in principle for a Pounds
200m plan to erect 400,000-volt powerlines through 50 miles of Cleveland and
North Yorkshire, but no work can start unless it has landowners' and
occupiers' consent to the installation of new pylons and lines.
The upgrading, requiring 240 pylons, each 150ft high, has provoked
opposition and the formation of a pressure group, Revolt - Rural England
Versus Overhead Lines Transmission.
In return for way-leaves - the licence required to erect pylons and overhead
lines - NGC has offered annual site rental payments of about Pounds 80 per
pylon, plus - as a incentive to prompt agreement - one-off sums of Pounds
300 per pylon and Pounds 200 for overhead lines.
In spite of this it has obtained by voluntary means only 25 of the 138
way-leaves it needs.
Now it wishes to resort to compulsion. The result is a seven-week programme
of hearings, starting today in Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, and moving later
to North Yorkshire. At these hearings independent Department of Trade and
Industry inspectors will weigh the conflicting views of NGC and the
way-leave refusers.
One of those refusing way-leave is Mr David Dugdale, a farmer and Revolt
member. He said: 'The general feeling is there's no semblance of any sort of
national need or national good about this proposed route. It's purely
related to private gain by shareholders and senior executives of the
electricity companies.' NGC insists upgrading is critically important to
allow transmission of more, cheaply generated electricity from gas, hydro
and nuclear stations.
The protestors' objections include the pylons' visual impact and the
hindrance they create for modern farming methods.
There is also deep unease about the possible link between electro-magnetic
fields and cancer. NGC, which is funding research into this, said that while
a possible connection existed with childhood leukaemia, the National
Radiological Protection Board had not issued any precautionary guidelines on
electro-magnetic fields and high-voltage transmission.
Mr Dugdale and other NGC opponents insist that potential risk should not be
ignored. 'It must be a policy of prudent avoidance,' he said.

FT  01 NOV 94 / PIA orders its first suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new watchdog to protect the private investor drew its first blood
yesterday when it suspended the investment business of Bayliss &amp; Co, an
independent financial adviser.
The Personal Investment Authority, which became operational in July, said it
made its first intervention after discovering inaccuracies in the company's
application to be regulated by it. These related to information in the
management accounts.
The PIA does not suggest that investors have been wrongly advised.
Mr Clive Rosier, who runs Bayliss, said yesterday that he had lodged an
appeal against the suspension.
Suspensions, which resulted either in a termination of membership or a
reinstatement, were common under the previous regulatory arrangements in
which Fimbra was the self-regulating organisation for independent financial
advisers and Lautro was the self-regulating organisation for life insurers.
Mr Rosier denied that the information he had given the PIA had been
materially misleading and said he was confident that he could meet the
membership requirements.
He also expressed concern that the suspension notice had been issued without
giving him more opportunity to deal with the regulator's questions.
The company is based in Oxfordshire and has about 400 clients. It deals
mainly in individuals' endowments and pensions but also has some small
corporate clients.
One of the PIA's tasks in bringing about a 'step change' in investor
protection was to introduce greater consistency to the different regulatory
approaches across the retail financial services sector.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Bidders for Coal Products chosen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Coal yesterday announced the four companies it has shortlisted to
bid in the second stage of the sale of Coal Products, its smokeless fuels
subsidiary. It said it expected to complete the privatisation in three
months.
The shortlisted companies are: Anglo United, which already has a significant
share of the market through its Coalite product; a management buy-in team
led by NatWest Ventures; a management buy-out team led by Mr David Foster,
Coal Products operations director; and Coal Developments, a company set up
by Mr David McErlain, former chairman of Anglo United, and Sir Harry
Solomon, former chairman of Hillsdown Holdings.
Coal Products is British Coal's second-biggest non-mining subsidiary, making
products including Homefire for the domestic market and Phurnacite for
industry. Last year it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 16m on turnover of
Pounds 131m.
The company estimates that it has 30 per cent of the UK solid smokeless fuel
market and 60 per cent of the UK foundry coke market. It has four main
plants.
The shortlisted companies were selected from 10 which made preliminary
offers. Final offers are due to be submitted by mid-December.
British Coal and its adviser Price Waterhouse Corporate Finance will then
choose a bidder with a view to competing the sale by mid-January.
The government said yesterday that Pounds 200m worth of work on new
technologies to burn coal more efficiently and make it more environmentally
acceptable had been initiated under its clean coal technology programme.
Mr Ian Taylor, technology minister, said the development of clean coal
technologies was important to maintain a central role for coal in meeting
the UK's long-term energy needs.
The government yesterday published a report setting out its objectives in
the clean coal programme.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Inspectors want urgent action on GNVQs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Urgent action is needed to improve the new General National Vocational
Qualifications, which ministers hope will be taken by a quarter of all
16-year-olds, government inspectors said yesterday.
The Office for Standards in Education, the schools watchdog, said the
qualifications - dubbed 'vocational A-levels' by the government - needed a
more manageable assessment of standards, better course design and tougher
external checks.
It said that the rate of improvement since Ofsted last reported on the
qualifications during their pilot 12 months ago was 'far too slow'. Advanced
GNVQs completed their pilot earlier this year, and were attempted by only
3,800 students.
Mr Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, said: 'We are concerned
that if urgent action is not taken then the credibility of the
qualifications will be undermined. That would be a tragedy, given the
possibilities which now lie before us.'
He pointed to problems in the way the National Council for Vocational
Qualifications, the quango which administers the new qualifications,
assessed standards.
He said that external assessors did not check that different institutions
used the same gradings when setting assessment, and the curriculum had not
been defined with sufficient clarity.
The national council stresses that it measures competencies, using the
driving test as an analogy. Mr Woodhead rejected the comparison, pointing
out that employers wanted some idea of how well students had performed,
rather than whether they had managed to pass.
The inspectors said the coursework produced for advanced GNVQs - taken in
the sixth form - was equivalent in its standard to two academic A-levels, in
line with government intentions. However, 25 per cent of work for
intermediate GNVQs did not come up to the intended standard of four GCSEs.
The Further Education Funding Council for England published a report on
GNVQs in colleges, which have a stronger tradition of training and
vocational education than schools. It found that the strengths of GNVQs
outweighed their weaknesses but identified 'teething problems'. These
included variable assessment practices and too little attention to the 'core
skills' of literacy and numeracy.
Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, said the reports 'powerfully
reinforced' the list of demands for improvement which he gave the national
council earlier this year. He said that reforms were now needed 'with still
greater urgency'.
Mr John Hillier, chief executive of the national council, acknowledged
'inevitable teething problems' with the qualification. He said the council
was 'working very hard to accelerate the development of our quality system'.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Companies plan policy shift over directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Listed companies plan to make more use of non-executive directors and
already increasingly use them in important meetings and on powerful
committees, according to a survey published yesterday.
Nearly 600 big companies were asked by Pro Ned, the employment agency for
non-executives, and the Board for Chartered Accountants in Business, about
their attitudes to non-executives and the work they do.
The survey concluded: 'Britain's major listed companies are leading a trend
towards a more professional and hard-nosed approach to the selection and use
of non-executive directors.' More than 80 per cent of the companies said
they expected non-executives to be more active and spend more time
understanding the company's business in the future.
There are still some indications that the old system lives on, however.
About 60 per cent of chairman admit their last non-executive appointment was
made through personal connections.
In contrast more than 40 per cent expect that their approach will change
with their next appointment and that the search for non-executives is now
more rigorous.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Workers at Rover accept 10.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover Group car workers have voted narrowly to accept a pay deal which for
most of them is worth 10.7 per cent over the next two years.
In a postal ballot 11,993 backed the package - seen by many outside the
company as over-generous and a dangerous pointer for pay deals elsewhere -
and 11,102 voted against it.
Mr Tony Woodley, the TGWU national officer for the car industry, said: 'The
closeness of the result reflects the complexity of the deal and the
frustration among the workforce still undergoing major changes. The company
should take nothing for granted.'
Rover said it welcomed the result.
Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analyst,
said: 'The narrow result reflects the fact that people are looking for a
little bit more on top of proposed pay offers.'
Although the deal provides a 3.7 per cent general pay increase from next
month and a further 4 per cent in November 1995 or inflation if higher, most
Rover workers will gain extra pay as a result of changes in the grading
structure that replaces five manual grades and six non-manual grades with
three joint grades. The unions have calculated that this will produce
increases of about Pounds 5 a week in the first year and a further Pounds
1.86 a week in the second.
Mr Hatchett said the recent rejection by Jaguar workers of a pay offer worth
7.5 per cent over two years may have hardened resistance among Rover Group
workers. A strike ballot is being held among Jaguar workers, although talks
are continuing between the company and the unions and neither side believes
they are on course to conflict.
Shopfloor unease reflected at the two companies seems likely to add to
pressures at Nissan and Peugeot-Talbot, which are about to negotiate deals.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Bonuses boost boardroom pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's top company directors are continuing to enjoy earnings rises
substantially higher than either the rate of inflation or the increases
awarded to their employees, says a survey published today.
The number of companies where the chief executive earns more than Pounds 1m
a year doubled from eight to 16 in the past 12 months, according to the
study by Monks Partnership, the independent remuneration adviser.
It found that the highest-paid directors in the country's biggest industrial
companies - with annual turnovers of more than Pounds 400m - secured 9.0 per
cent median earnings rises, three times the level of rises received by the
employed workforce as a whole.
While the best-paid chief executives in the financial sector enjoyed total
median earnings increases worth 7.3 per cent, rises of 5.8 per cent were
recorded for top directors in companies in industry and commerce, taking
their remuneration from a median of Pounds 130,000 to Pounds 137,000 a year.
The survey points out that the rate of increase in executive pay in the
industrial sector has slowed to its lowest for five years. More than a
quarter of commercial and industrial best-paid directors received no rise at
all - on the other hand the top quarter enjoyed total earnings improvements
worth at least 18.9 per cent.
The growth in executive pay reflects an increase in annual bonus payments.
In companies with annual turnovers of more than Pounds 400m these amounted
to median rises of 4.1 per cent. In enterprises with turnovers of between
Pounds 30m and Pounds 100m they were only 1.1 per cent.
Bonus payments make up an average 18 per cent of total remuneration and
contribute just over 15 per cent to the remuneration of the best paid
directors. In the finance sector they amount to 22.4 per cent.
The biggest earnings growth has been in the retail and distribution sector
with a 9.1 per cent improvement in earnings (6.0 per cent in basic pay plus
3.1 per cent from bonuses), followed by electrical engineering and
electronics with 8.4 per cent and leisure and services with 7.7 per cent.
The smallest earnings rises were found in the building materials and
construction sector, where top executives averaged only 2.7 per cent rises.
Mr David Atkins, editor of the survey, said yesterday the results showed
that there was 'a much closer relationship between company performance and
total earnings' for top executives.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Fayed lists bill 'discrepancies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohamed Fayed yesterday renewed his onslaught on Mr Jonathan Aitken, the
chief secretary to the Treasury, by alleging that there were 'discrepancies'
in Mr Aitken's account of how he settled his FFr8,010.90 bill for a weekend
at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
Mr Aitken last week faced allegations in The Guardian newspaper that he had
allowed a businessman, Mr Said Ayas, to pay just under half the cost of his
stay, without declaring this alleged gift.
He then attempted to defuse the allegations by saying that the bill had been
settled in full, but in two stages. An initial payment of FFr4,257.00 in
cash had been made by his wife, who had not been staying with him at the
Ritz, when Mr Aitken checked out of the hotel on September 19.
She had paid less than the full FFr8,010.90 because of a billing error, Mr
Aitken said. The balance was then settled by Mr Ayas, to whose hotel bill
the costs of Mr Aitken's stay had been transferred.
Mr Aitken said that once he realised that his wife had paid too little, he
paid Mr Ayas what he owed him.
Mr Fayed, who owns the Ritz and is conducting a campaign to destabilise the
government, yesterday attempted to pick holes in Mr Aitken's explanation in
two respects.
He said he had checked with the cashier at the Ritz and had been told that
the 'brunette lady' who settled Mr Ayas's bill with a cheque for FFr117,008
'was the same person who paid the cash sum Mr Aitken says was paid by his
wife'. This 'brunette lady' also said to the cashier that she had been
paying 'other bills at the George V and the Intercontinental'.
Mr Fayed added 'Unless Mrs Aitken was also paying the other cheques to the
other hotels, the brunette in question was working on Mr Ayas' staff'.
Mr Michael Cole, speaking for Mr Fayed, said there were also peculiarities
about the documentation Mr Aitken had produced as evidence that he had paid
the balance to Mr Ayas.
Last Friday Mr Aitken reproduced copies of a cheque for Pounds 426.88,
roughly the amount owed, which was made out to Mr Abdul Rahman, an associate
of Mr Ayas.
The details on the cheque did not, however, appear to be a perfect match
with details on Mr Rahman's bank statement, which was reproduced in the
Daily Mail last Saturday.
The statement of Mr Rahman's account at the Arab Bank (Switzerland) says
that a cheque 'du 31.3.94' was paid in to Mr Rahman's account. This seems to
imply that the cheque was dated '31.3.94', though Mr Aitken's cheque is in
fact dated '21.2.1994'.
The statement also apparently says that the amount deposited was Pounds
426.80 - though the final '0' is unclear on the reproduction - compared with
the Pounds 426.88 of the cheque.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Manager denies multiple share bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The contracts manager for City-based Gartmore Investment Management
repeatedly breached signed declarations designed to prevent multiple
applications in the power industry privatisation, a court was told
yesterday.
Mr Richard McGregor-Johnson, prosecuting, told Southwark Crown Court in
London that Mr Stuart Fisher used the names of colleagues to obtain hundreds
of shares he was not entitled to.
He said that Mr Fisher's allegedly dishonest dealings involved the 1991
privatisations of the English and Scottish electricity generating companies.
Mr McGregor-Johnson said: 'The prosecution say that this defendant was not
content to apply only once for his own benefit, but dishonestly made
multiple applications for shares in those two flotations.'
The prosecution alleges that Mr Fisher knew he was breaking the law.
Mr McGregor-Johnson said Mr Fisher, of Borough Green, Sevenoaks, Kent, had
denied four counts of obtaining property by deception and three of
attempting to obtain property by deception. He told the court that each
charge represented applications for 300 shares made either in the names of
people he worked with or knew.
He said: 'The crown says the defendant persuaded them to allow him to use
their names and put them forward for those applications on the basis that if
he was successful, they would get a few beers or a curry as a reward but he
would get any profits he made for the shares.'
Mr McGregor-Johnson said that all the applications were supported by cheques
drawn on Mr Fisher's account, although not all were successful. Mr Fisher
sold the shares he obtained through his company's dealing department.
The trial continues today.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Heath wants part of cash probe in public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister, last night raised
the pressure on the Commons committee of privileges to hold at least part of
its inquiry into the 'cash for questions' affair in public.
He said that the departure from precedent this would involve was necessary
in order to redress the slump in public confidence in the Commons. Sir
Edward told the Commons that the presence of Sir Nicholas Lyell, the
attorney-general, as a member of the committee should ensure that witnesses
were not unfairly treated.
He declined to go as far as Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, who
wanted the views expressed by committee members as they debated their
conclusions to be heard in public. Mr Benn made clear that while he remained
a member of the committee he would provide his own report on all its
proceedings.
Mr John Prescott, Labour deputy leader, called on MPs to accept it was in
their interest that 'malpractice is rooted out and guidelines devised which
are easily understood by both us and the public'.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, said that all the evidence heard
by the committee would be published, along with its conclusions, and then
debated by the Commons.
Commenting on the possibility of a 'half-way house' with some of the
committee's proceedings being conducted in public and others in private, Mr
Newton said: 'I do not see how such an arrangement could be made to work.'
A Labour motion urging the committee to examine witnesses in public, except
when reasons of natural justice dictated otherwise, was defeated by a
majority of 37 (301-264). A government amendment reaffirming the committee's
right to decide for itself whether to sit in public or private was carried
without a division.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Fayed renews attack on Aitken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohamed Fayed yesterday renewed his onslaught on Mr Jonathan Aitken, the
chief secretary to the Treasury, by alleging that there were 'discrepancies'
in Mr Aitken's account of how he settled his Fr8010.90 bill for a weekend at
the Ritz Hotel in Paris.
Mr Aitken last week faced allegations in The Guardian newspaper that he had
allowed a businessman, Mr Said Ayas, to pay just under half the cost of his
stay, without declaring this alleged gift.
He then attempted to defuse the allegations by saying that the bill had been
settled in full, but in two stages. An initial payment of Fr4257.00 in cash
had been made by his wife, who had not been staying with him at the Ritz,
when Mr Aitken checked out of the hotel on September 19.
She had paid less than the full Fr8010.90 because of a billing error, Mr
Aitken said. The balance was then settled by Mr Ayas, to whose hotel bill
the costs of Mr Aitken's stay had been transferred.
Mr Aitken said that once he realised that his wife had paid too little, he
paid Mr Ayas what he owed him.
Mr Fayed, who owns the Ritz and is conducting a campaign to destabilise the
government, yesterday attempted to pick holes in Mr Aitken's explanation in
two respects.
He said he had checked with the cashier at the Ritz and had been told that
the 'brunette lady' who settled Mr Ayas's bill with a cheque for Fr117,008
'was the same person who paid the cash sum Mr Aitken says was paid by his
wife'.
This 'brunette lady' also said to the cashier that she had been paying
'other bills at the George V and the Intercontinental'.
Mr Fayed added 'Unless Mrs Aitken was also paying the other cheques to the
other hotels, the brunette in question was working on Mr Ayas' staff'.
Mr Michael Cole, speaking for Mr Fayed, said there were also peculiarities
about the documentation Mr Aitken had produced as evidence that he had paid
the balance to Mr Ayas.
Last Friday Mr Aitken reproduced copies of a cheque for Pounds 426.88,
roughly the amount owed, which was made out to Mr Abdul Rahman, an associate
of Mr Ayas.
The details on the cheque did not, however, appear to be a perfect match
with details on Mr Rahman's bank statement, which was reproduced in the
Daily Mail last Saturday.
The statement of Mr Rahman's account at the Arab Bank (Switzerland) says
that a cheque 'du 31.3.94' was paid in to Mr Rahman's account. This seems to
imply that the cheque was dated '31.3.94', though Mr Aitken's cheque is in
fact dated '21.2.1994'.
The statement also apparently says that the amount deposited was Pounds
426.80 - though the final '0' is unclear on the reproduction - compared with
the Pounds 426.88 of the cheque.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Blair announces whips' office team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour last night announced eight new appointments to its 16-strong whips'
office in the last stage of Mr Tony Blair's shake-up of the party's
frontbench team.
The injection of new blood - all eight newcomers come from the ranks of the
1992 parliamentary intake - was in keeping with the Labour leader's strategy
of giving the whips' office a fresh role as a training ground for promising
MPs.
The announcement, expected last week, was delayed after Mr Don Dixon, the
deputy chief whip, complained that he had not been consulted.
The newcomers include Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's former communications
director, Ms Tessa Jowell, MP for Dulwich, Ms Estelle Morris (Birmingham
Yardley) and Ms Barbara Roche (Hornsey and Wood Green). The other
appointments are Mr Stephen Byers, (Wallsend), Mr Eric Clarke (Midlothian),
Mr Geoff Hoon (Ashfield) and Mr George Mudie (Leeds East). Mr Gordon
McMaster (Paisley South) was promoted from Scottish whip to deputy chief
whip's assistant.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US rules threaten tanker groups -
Shipowners fear new pollution regulations may halt oil shipments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough new rules imposing unlimited financial liability on tankers sailing
into US waters could cause severe damage to the tanker industry and halt oil
shipments to the US, according to shipowners.
The new regulations were first proposed in the wake of the sinking of the
tanker Exxon Valdez off the coast of Alaska in 1989, and repeated appeals to
the US Coast Guard to relax the new rules or delay them have had no effect.
A decline in domestic oil production has made the US more dependent on
imported oil, with about half of its total needs coming from the Middle East
and other overseas oilfields.
Owners of tankers entering US waters after December 28 will be required to
show they can provide unlimited compensation in the event of an oil spill.
Although this deadline is still two months away, vessels are often chartered
well in advance.
In return for proof that they could meet a claim, shipowners will be issued
with a 'certificate of financial responsibility' by the Coast Guard.
The conventional method by which shipowners arrange insurance cover -
through protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) clubs of owners who share risks -
cannot be used because the P&amp;I clubs are unwilling to take on unlimited
liability.
'The Coast Guard has created a claim structure which is unsustainable with
existing insurance systems,' said Mr Miles Kulukundis, chairman of
Intertanko, representing many of the world's tanker owners.
Only 41 tankers, all American and including Mobil Oil Corporation's 24-ship
fleet, have obtained certificates to allow them to sail into US waters. But
at least three other shipowners, including Knock Tankers, an Oslo-based
company with 13 vessels, have announced plans to withdraw from the US trade.
The total world oil tanker fleet is more than 7,000 vessels, of which at
least 1,000 serve US ports. The loss of US business would be a severe
setback for tanker owners.
The International Chamber of Shipping, a London-based shipowners'
organisation representing more than half the world's merchant tonnage, said
that it was a matter of 'deep concern' that the US Coast Guard had 'not
attempted to solve any of the serious problems' posed by its rules.
The shipowners believe the P&amp;I clubs should remain the main method of
covering risk, but said they 'unreservedly' supported them in their refusal
to take on the risk of unlimited liability. Alternatives such as surety
bonds, self-insurance and financial guarantees required the shipowner to
provide large amounts of collateral and were only an option for the largest
corporations.
The alternative for most smaller shipowners was insurance but there were no
insurance schemes available to provide the cover needed. 'In the absence of
insurance cover, oil shipments in US waters will largely cease as from
December 28,' Mr Chris Horrocks, secretary general of the international
chamber, warned.
Mr Kulukundis said shipowners hoped the insurance and financial communities
could devise a means of providing cover. 'The financial community is hungry
for this business,' he said. Failing that, the oil industry might be
persuaded to provide financial backing to ensure sufficient oil for its
refineries.
The requirement for certificates of financial responsibility forms part of
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which will also progressively require tankers
to be doubled-hulled to reduce the risk of pollution. A US court recently
awarded Dollars 5bn in punitive damages against Exxon following pollution of
the Alaskan shoreline by the Exxon Valdez in 1989.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Clouds over Australia-NZ trade relations -
'Open skies' freeze is latest sign of slower integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by the Australian government last week to freeze moves towards
'open skies' with New Zealand underlines the extent to which progress in the
broader trade relationship between the two countries has stalled.
Precisely why the Australian authorities chose to deny Air New Zealand's
right to fly domestic Australian routes from today, which it was not, in any
case, planning to do immediately, is not clear. The official explanation is
that the two countries have yet to set up the borderless visa and customs
arrangements which were due to accompany 'open skies' and to reach an agreed
stance on airline ownership and control matters.
But this is not the whole story. One possibility is that the Australian
government wants to protect Qantas, the country's flagship carrier, before
floating its 75 per cent interest in the airline next year.
A second view is that the Australian authorities are more interested in
achieving a further rationalisation of Australasian air services - perhaps
via an alliance between Air New Zealand and Ansett, the Australian carrier
that already flies domestically within New Zealand. This would extend the
duopoly in the Australian market across the Tasman.
The stalling in the broader trade relationship between the two countries is
in sharp contrast to the 1980s, when big steps were taken towards the
creation of a single trans-Tasman trade bloc. In 1983, the two countries
signed a 'Closer Economic Relations' (CER) pact under which they pledged to
create a trans-Tasman free-trade zone for manufactured goods.
The CER was reviewed in 1988 and the date for free trade brought forward by
five years to July 1990. At that stage, the two countries also agreed to
free trade in services, except for certain exempted sectors such as aviation
and telecommunications. They also promised to deepen the trade relationship
through the harmonisation of business law and quarantine/customs procedures,
and pledged to remove technical barriers to trade, such as product standards
laws.
Since then, the tempo has slowed, leaving some important issues unaddressed.
There has, for example, been no visible progress on key taxation matters -
such as mutual recognition of franking credits to stop double taxation of
dividends paid by trans-Tasman companies - or on corporate/business law.
Explanations for the change in pace are various. First, while benefits of
the CER have accrued to both countries, New Zealand is widely thought to
have been the greater beneficiary. Australia is New Zealand's biggest buyer
of manufactured goods, taking about a fifth of its exports. By contrast, New
Zealand accounts for about 6 per cent of Australia's exports.
Indeed, five years ago Australia's Bureau of Industry Economics forecast
that New Zealanders would get around eight times more benefit per head than
Australians.
On a longer-term view, 30 years ago, Australia exported to its neighbour
four times the amount that it imported. The balance has shifted dramatically
in New Zealand's favour: in the year to June, Australian exports to New
Zealand were ADollars 4bn (USDollars 2.9bn) and its imports were ADollars
3.2bn.
That said, the rate of growth in Australian exports to New Zealand (about 19
per cent) has outstripped import growth (15-16 per cent) over the past two
years. Nevertheless, some New Zealanders suspect Canberra may have decided
that the uneven benefits had gone far enough and that, in the case of the
'open skies' policy, separate though it is from the CER, it was time for
redress.
A second factor is more political. The relationship between Mr Paul Keating,
Australia's prime minister, and Mr Jim Bolger, his New Zealand counterpart,
is supposedly cordial. Nevertheless, Sir Frank Holmes, professor emeritus
with the Institute of Policy Studies in Wellington, thinks that the last
Australian election, when the Liberal party endorsed much of New Zealand's
hard-nosed economic reform programme, soured Mr Keating's attitude towards
Australia's neighbour. There is a feeling that Mr Keating would now like to
widen the gap between the two.
A third factor may be that both countries are looking towards the
fast-growing Asian markets for further export growth. This tends to
dim-inish the significance of the trans-Tasman relationship - although the
CER has been promoted as a model for the region and there are joint efforts
to link it to Afta, the free trade agreement between the Association of
South-East Asian Nations. At the same time, New Zealand and Australia are
competing to sell themselves as English-speaking gateways into the region.
In New Zealand there is some disquiet. There is talk of a new lobby group to
give the CER a new push. Mr Ted Woodford, the former New Zealand high
commissioner in Canberra, said recently that it had lost its momentum and
that it was important for moves to be made at a political level to reinforce
its good features. The aviation dispute seems a step in the wrong direction.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China signs deal with S Korea to develop
airliner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Korean and China yesterday agreed to develop a 100-seat passenger
aircraft by the end of the decade in the latest of several proposed Asian
aerospace projects.
The Dollars 1.5bn Sino-Korean project is meant to meet growing demand for
regional airliners in Asia. Taiwan and Indonesia have already announced
similar programmes.
The aerospace agreement was signed during the first day of a visit by
Chinese premier Li Peng to Seoul, following a memorandum of understanding
reached in June.
China and Korea will equally share between 70 per cent and 80 per cent in a
joint venture to be formed next year. Western partners providing engine and
other advanced technology would be given a 20 per cent share, while other
Asian aviation companies, possibly from India and Indonesia, would be
granted a 10 per cent stake.
Samsung Aerospace was recently selected to head the project's Korean
consortium, which also includes Korean Air, Daewoo Heavy Industries and
Halla Shipbuilding &amp; Heavy Industries. Chinese participation is being led by
Aviation Industries of China.
The joint venture is expected to select the aircraft type and foreign
technical partners by early next year.
The aircraft programme has been promoted by the Korean government as one of
the nation's main industrial goals over the next decade.
However, Korean aerospace companies and airlines have privately expressed
scepticism about the project because of the availability of similar and
cheaper western aircraft.
Korean officials argue that a domestic airliner is needed to reduce the
country's dependence on imports of foreign aircraft and parts, which are
expected to cost Dollars 3bn a year by 1997.
The project's development target date of 1998 is also considered unrealistic
by some analysts because of the lack of aerospace expertise, particularly in
Korea.
China is expected to provide most of the basic aerospace technology, while
Korea's contribution will be mainly financing and production technology.
But the Sino-Korean partners still disagree over which country will be
responsible for final assembly of the aircraft. China is also understood to
be interested in collaborating in a proposed project to develop a 70-100
seat regional aircraft with Japan in partnership with Boeing of the US.
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan have
all sought to expand their presence in the aerospace industry through
increased collaboration with western airframe, aero-engine, components and
systems manufacturers as well as through their own programmes.
Western aerospace groups have also been keen to seek joint ventures with
Asian partners to strengthen their presence in the growing regional market
for commercial and defence equipment.

<TEXT>
Coca-Cola yesterday sought to register its bottle as a trade mark on the
first day of applications under the UK Trade Marks Act 1994. The act allows
three-dimensional shapes, sounds and smells to be protected as registered
trademarks for the first time in the UK. Eight years ago, Coca-Cola failed
in a test case under the old Act to register the shape of its bottle. Its
new attempt is expected to be accepted.
In the first hour yesterday at the Patent Office in Newport, south Wales,
373 applications were made. They included the shape of the chocolate in a
Toblerone bar, the red telephone and jingle used in advertisements for
Direct Line, the British insurance company, and the smell of roses
impregnated into Sumitomo tyres. In all, about 800 applications were made
yesterday.

Mr Rusli Noor, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation
(Apec) secretariat, yesterday expressed confidence that the November 15 Apec
summit in Indonesia would help accelerate plans to liberalise trade in the
Asia-Pacific region, despite the reservations of some members. 'There are
certainly some sorts of concerns (on the free-trade plan) among the members
of Apec,' he said. Although it was not possible to assess the impact of such
concerns on the summit, Apec's goals of trade liberalisation could
eventually be realised.
Apec groups Australia, the US, Canada, Mexico, Japan, China, Hong Kong,
Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Singapore, Thailand, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. Chile will become a
full member in November. At the summit, in Bogor, Indonesia, leaders of the
18 economies will discuss ways to remove rules that hamper trade. China and
Malaysia have said they will not accept a binding timetable for free trade,
while a Japanese trade official has said that, although Tokyo basically
supports freer trade, it is not ready to accept blindly all proposed
liberalisation measures.

FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Nations queue to join WTO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Three countries have formally applied to join the World Trade Organisation,
even though it has yet to come into existence. This is in addition to the
125 nations which took part in the Uruguay Round global trade negotiations.
Slovenia, which became the 124th member of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade at the weekend, has already opened negotiations to join the WTO,
which is due to start work on January 1 next year. Gatt will be absorbed by
the new organisation.
Croatia, which applied for Gatt membership last year, now says it wants to
join the WTO directly. And Sudan last week became the first country not to
apply for Gatt membership at all, but to aim straight for WTO entry. WTO
membership requires applicants to sign up to fair trade rules covering not
only goods, as Gatt does, but also services and intellectual property. In
addition, members must submit schedules of market opening commitments for
goods and services agreed after bilateral negotiations with trading
partners. Some 19 nations are continuing to negotiate Gatt accession,
including China and Algeria which took part in the Uruguay Round. The
assumption is that they will all apply to join the WTO in due course. China
and Taiwan are already negotiating on services and intellectual property in
readiness for WTO membership.
Among the others, the most advanced is Mongolia, where agreement on Gatt
membership terms is close. A four-day meeting of the working party
considering Mongolia's draft protocol of accession starts today. Ecuador has
also begun tariff negotiations marking the final stage of the Gatt entry
process.

FT  01 NOV 94 / India aims to curb currency inflows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India has ordered companies raising funds on international capital markets
to keep the money abroad until it is needed for specific projects, in a move
designed to curb a huge foreign currency flow into the country.
Groups will also be banned from issuing warrants, instruments which give
investors the right to buy shares at a fixed price at a future date, to
increase the authorities' control over Euro-issues.
The policy announced at the weekend comes after an unprecedented surge in
India's foreign exchange reserves from about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 617m) at
the time of the 1991 balance of payments crisis to Dollars 19bn. The inflow
has been primarily caused by foreign fund managers investing funds in the
Indian stock market and in the overseas stock and bond issues of Indian
companies.
While the reserves, covering the cost of nine months' imports, have given
India a valuable cushion against shocks in oil and other international
markets, the rush of money into India has fuelled domestic inflation.
The annual rate of increases in wholesale prices has fallen from a high of
about 11 per cent earlier this year to 9 per cent, but the finance ministry
wants it below 7 per cent.
Indian companies, which raised Dollars 1.4bn in the year to March from
international equity offerings, have collected a further Dollars 1.1bn in
the first six months of the 1994-95 financial year. Applications for issues
worth another Dollars 5bn are waiting for government approval.
A finance ministry official said the new rules would enable India to manage
its balance of payments more easily. A senior official said the country was
importing inflation through the sustained inflow of foreign exchange from
Euromarket issues. In future a sudden rush of issues would no longer affect
the foreign exchange accounts.
The ministry, which approves issues under guidelines established in May,
said companies would be required to submit quarterly audited statements on
their Euro-issues and the uses to which the funds were being put. This is to
prevent money being diverted for unauthorised purposes such as financial
market investment.
As for the ban on warrants, officials said the restriction was being imposed
because tight rules had recently been established on the domestic issue of
warrants to prevent business families, which control many Indian companies,
issuing warrants to themselves at low prices. The ban on overseas warrant
issues would prevent companies circumventing the domestic rules, said the
officials.
In a separate measure, the ministry relaxed a ban on financial institutions
tapping the international markets, giving long-term development banks the
right to make issues.
India plans further to ease foreign currency dealing rules and cut more of
the red tape that has deterred some foreign investors, Reuter reports from
New Delhi. 'We may introduce new products for dealers to manage their
foreign exchange risk,' Mr OP Sodhani, executive director of the Reserve
Bank of India, said, mentioning cross-currency options as the broad area in
which changes were desirable. India switched to market-based foreign
exchange dealings in 1992 by making the rupee fully convertible on the trade
account under a three-year-old economic reform programme.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Bakhtiar murder trial starts in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The alleged assassins of Iran's former prime minister, Mr Shahpour Bakhtiar,
will go on trial in Paris tomorrow in a case which is likely to further
strain relations between France and Iran.
The trial will focus on whether Mr Bakhtiar, the last prime minister of the
late Shah of Iran, was killed on the orders of Tehran's Islamic government.
Three Iranians, including a relative of Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the
country's president, will answer charges for the 1991 assassination. Six
others will be charged in absentia.
The Iranian government has denied any involvement in the killing, which was
one of dozens of assassinations of opponents of the Tehran regime over the
past decade. But Mr Jean-Louis Bruguiere, a senior investigating judge,
claims that Iran's secret services were involved in the crime.
The French government has implemented tight security at the Palais de
Justice, where the trial will take place. The case, to be heard by seven
magistrates, is expected to last about a month.
Relations between France and Iran have been damaged by Tehran's support for
Moslem fundamentalists seeking the overthrow of the military-backed regime
in Algeria, a former French colony, and by a French crackdown on Islamic
fundamentalism.
Following the assassination of five French nationals in Algeria in August,
the French interior ministry introduced sweeping stop-and-search operations
and interned 26 suspected Moslem militants. Last week the government said it
would enforce a ban on wearing Islamic headscarves in secular state schools.
Twenty-five students have been expelled from French schools for wearing
headscarves. Mr Francois Bayrou, the education minister, said he had ordered
schools to bar 'ostentatious religious symbols' and said there were few
alternatives to expulsion when persuasion failed.
The move has brought an angry reaction from Iran and from other Islamic
countries.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Wary businessmen welcome Mideast progress: Casablanca talks
offer good contacts, but doubts remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International businessmen and bankers yesterday lauded recent political and
macro-economic changes in the Middle East but delivered a hard-headed
assessment of further reforms needed to open economies and stimulate large
flows of investment into the region.
While more than 1,000 businessmen have come to the Middle East and North
Africa Economic Summit in Casablanca, most are likely to go away with a pile
of business cards and the seeds of future investments rather than signed
contracts. 'We've made some good contacts here, though whether anything will
actually transpire only time will tell,' said Mr Abraham Glezeman, president
of Inter-Power, a US company seeking to develop a power plant in the Gaza
Strip. 'But it exceeded my expectations.'
For most businessmen at the Casablanca casbah, peace moves in the region are
a necessary but not sufficient condition for greater investment and better
integrated economies. They want further reforms, including speeding up
stalled privatisation programmes, removing trade barriers - among them the
Arab economic boycott of Israel - abolishing excessive import restrictions
and laws which restrict foreign equity holdings, reinforcing intellectual
property rights, guaranteeing full repatriation of profits and dividends,
granting better tax holidays and ensuring international mechanisms for the
resolution of disputes.
Mr Tom Vaughan, a director of Unilever, said: 'Most businesses have many
places where they can invest their money and they are looking for a business
environment of reasonable risks and good returns. It's still too early for
specific deals but its very good to see Arab and Israeli delegations
together talking about business, trade and economics.'
Mr Sandy Allan, president of Coca-Cola Middle East, said his company had
invested Dollars 350m in the region in the past five years and was seeking
further expansion: 'There are problems but the potential for profitable
businesses in the Middle East and North Africa is still excellent.'
Some bankers said they were enthusiastic about the strengthening of emerging
markets in the Middle East especially in Morocco, Jordan and Israel. Mr
Daniel Smaller of Union Bank of Switzerland's emerging equity markets
division, said the conference 'supports the view that these are exciting
markets going through positive changes. For the first time the additional
risk of geopolitical instability has been reduced, so price/earnings rations
are expanding, providing investors with opportunities to participate.'
However, Sir William Ryrie, executive director of Barings, said that of a
total Dollars 62bn of equity flows into emerging markets last year, only
Dollars 200m went to the Middle East. 'The peace process slightly improves
our type of business,' he said. 'But the Middle East is way behind the
game.'
It emerged yesterday the first merchant bank to be set up in North Africa
has just received approval from the central bank in Tunis. International
Merchant Bank will have capital of between Dollars 3m and Dollars 5m and
brings together individual shareholders from North African countries,
institutions like the World Bank's International Finance Corporation which
has contributed Dollars 300,000, and two European commercial banks - Societe
Marseillaise de Credit and Creditanstalt Finanziaria, the Italian subsidiary
of Austria's Creditanstalt Bankverein.
But potential investors in the tourism sector are most likely to leave
Casablanca with real deals in their pockets. Unfolding Middle East peace has
increased public perceptions of regional stability, opened borders and
unlocked the development of multi-destination packages. Delegates are
expected to establish a regional tourism promotion and marketing body.
Mr Basil Jardaneh, chairman of Royal Jordanian, Jordan's state-owned
airline, said it was adding 20 flights next month.
Mr Peter Till, a vice-president of Marriott, said he was spending time at
the conference consolidating a planned project in the Gaza Strip for a hotel
with a private Palestinian company. He said Marriott was aggressively
seeking opportunities in Israel and looking at other Middle East countries.
'We are seeing increased stability and an improved business climate and we
want to do more business.'
Some companies are concerned about appeals by Israeli and Palestinian
leaders for the private sector to alleviate poverty in Palestinian areas.
'How do we square this with seeking good returns on investment?' asked Mr
Peter Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone investment bank of the US.
The extent of the difficulties ahead for the Middle East in attracting
private capital was demonstrated by the absence of Japanese companies. Mr
Riki Kogure, head of Middle East division of Itochu, the large trading
house, said only 1.2 per cent of total Japanese investment overseas went to
the Middle East, largely due to a cultural gaps between Arabs and Japanese
and the absence of high-level political links.
Japanese and other foreign companies will be critical to financing and
executing the multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects being put forward
at the summit. Mr Anthony Pellegrini, manager of the World Bank
infrastructure unit, said money from domestic budgets and concessional
finance was 'nowhere near sufficient to deal with the infrastructure needs
of the region'.
Mr Eberhard von Koerber, president of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish
engineering combine, said the region needed Dollars 80bn over 10 years to
meet basic power generation needs alone and warned: 'If the regulatory
environment does not allow capital to make adequate returns, then we have to
be very cautious.'

<TEXT>
Australia posted a budget deficit of ADollars 4.511bn (Pounds 2.05bn) for
the first three months of the fiscal year to June 30, 1995, against ADollars
2.962bn for the same period a year ago, finance minister Kim Beazley said.
'The relatively high cumulative deficit to the September quarter of ADollars
4.511bn mainly reflects lower revenue collections, largely due to timing
factors,' Mr Beazley said. Spending for the year to date was ADollars
31.619bn, up 4.5 per cent from a year ago. The May budget forecast of a
full-year deficit of ADollars 11.7bn assumes full-year spending growth of
5.7 per cent. Three-month revenue to September was ADollars 27.108 bn, down
0.7 per cent, compared with 8.4 per cent budgeted growth.

Mr Alex Arena, director-general, telecommunications, said video-on-demand

government freed 10 jailed separatist guerrillas. Police said they captured
one militant and injured another in a shootout at a militant hide-out in
Ghaziabad, near New Delhi. The police freed a fourth hostage, an American,
who was being held there.
The American, Bela Josef Nuss, said he was abducted from a guest house in
New Delhi and told by his captors about the seizure of the three Britons.
Police said they were not certain whether the Britons were also being kept
in Ghaziabad. The Britons were named as Paul Benjamin Ridout, Christopher
Myles Croston and Rhys Partridge.

The Angolan government and Unita rebels initialled a peace accord yesterday
to end almost two decades of civil war. The agreement caps a year of
UN-sponsored negotiations in the Zambian capital aimed at ending a conflict
that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and left millions homeless.
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita
leader, are expected to sign the accord in Lusaka later this month.
A peace agreement in 1991 led to elections the following year. They were won
by Mr dos Santos and his MPLA party, but Mr Savimbi rejected the results as
fraudulent. Fighting erupted again, continuing throughout the peace talks
and intensifying in recent weeks.
Under the accord, Unita fighters are to be demobilised eventually and either
sent home or incorporated into the national army. Unita will get some
government posts, specifically at provincial and municipal levels. A
commission representing the government, Unita and the UN will oversee
implementation of the accord.

<TEXT>
Algeria's military-backed government is to hold a presidential election by
the end of next year - in an apparent gesture to Moslem fundamentalists. The
decision, announced yesterday by President Liamine Zeroual, will cut short
his term of office by at least a year.
Algeria has been convulsed with conflict since parliamentary elections were
cancelled in January 1992, when the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) appeared
on the verge of victory. In the ensuing turmoil, the FIS was banned and
thousands have been killed, including 68 foreigners targeted by Moslem
extremists.
The Algerian government recently opened contacts with militant Islamic
leaders, but President Zeroual said at the weekend there was an impasse
because they still supported insurgency. 'The moment has come to remove the
obstacles to people's expression and to allow them to speak directly,' he
declared yesterday. 'I have decided that the presidential elections will
take place before the end of 1995.'
Mr Zeroual stressed his 'determination' to pursue the 'eradication of
terrorism and violence'. His willingness to move towards elections appears
to be a gesture of conciliation to the more pragmatic fundamentalists, as
well as to Algeria's legal opposition parties. He said the elections would
be free but did not specify whether the FIS could run.

FT  01 NOV 94 / China reveals money supply for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
China's central bank yesterday took a leap into greater public disclosure
when it published up-to-date money supply figures for the first time since
the Communist revolution.
These revealed that the broader M2 measure of monetary growth accelerated in
the third quarter in spite of the government's proclaimed tight credit
policy aimed at calming an overheating economy and curbing inflation.
The People's Bank of China, through the Financial News, its house journal,
reported that M2 grew by 37.1 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter
compared with 29.7 per cent in the second quarter. The M2 growth target for
1994 is 24 per cent.
Mr Dai Xianglong, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, expressed concern
about the M2 outcome. 'This shows that money supply is accelerating. . . and
inflationary pressure is growing,' he said.
The central bank official attributed the excessive monetary growth to higher
than planned capital spending by state enterprises, lack of budgetary
restraint, a blow-out in wages and salaries to government employees and
increases in payments to farmers.
Mr Dai made a plea for restraint, saying that for monetary policy to work in
the fight against inflation government departments would have to play their
part in curbing expenditures.
It seems that one of the People's Bank's motives in breaking with tradition
by publishing timely money supply statistics is to strengthen its argument
for restraint. The central bank is seeking to transform itself from a
passive state institution into a leader of the fight against inflation.
Consumer prices nationwide were up 27.4 per cent in September compared with
a year earlier. This was in spite of measures adopted earlier this year to
stiffen price controls on basic commodities and services. The bank also
published figures showing narrow M0 money supply growth of 26.4 per cent in
the third quarter, and M1 growth of 32.5 per cent.
It also reported foreign exchange reserves figures of Dollars 39.8bn at the
end of September, an 87 per cent increase on 1993. This was partly
attributed to an improved trading performance with exports exceeding imports
by Dollars 1.38bn in the first nine months.
Mr Dai said the decision to release the financial data was part of the
central bank's attempts to bring its operations into line with similar
international institutions. 'This will help the opening up and reform of our
financial system and make for better international exchange (of
information),' he told the Financial News.
Mr Dai indicated that publication of money supply figures would become
standard practice. He described the disclosure as 'an important step'.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Pin-up will help re-shape Japan's politics: The nine main
opposition parties are seeking a new name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese politics has become enlivened by Ms Fumie Hosokawa, a former pin-up
whose curvaceous shape elicits the envy of half the electorate and the
admiration of the rest.
Ms Hosokawa, unrelated to the former prime minister of that name, has been
chosen by Japan's nine main opposition groups to join a panel to choose a
name for the mega-party they plan to form next month.
They hope it will deliver the final blow to the conservative Liberal
Democratic party's weakened monopoly on power. It may mark a step from the
present arcane wranglings, which has left nearly 45 per cent of the
electorate unable to support any political party, to a more coherent balance
of power between two or three evenly-matched players.
Ms Hosokawa, a television personality who whimsically confesses she knows
nothing of politics, is a walk-on player in the newest of the series of
realignments that have over the past 18 months, opened cracks in Japan's
power structure and let in much fresh air in the process.
The starting signal for the latest realignment came on Sunday, when the
party that triggered the present upheavals, an LDP breakway group called the
Japan New party, disbanded two-and-a-half years after its formation, in
order to pave the way for a merger with its eight opposition allies.
The marriage of the nine is due to take place at what is billed to be a
spectacular celebration on December 10 in Minato Murai 21, a futuristic
complex around the world's most expensive building in Yokohama. The
organisers no doubt hope it will symbolise the new party's trend-setting
aspirations.
Ms Hosokawa and the other 15 members on the opposition's party-naming panel
are due to announce the title of the new group, to an orchestral fanfare in
Minato Murai 21, conducted by Mr Tsutomu Hata, former prime minister and
karaoke supremo. The opposition nine formed a parliamentary voting bloc last
month under the name of Kaikaku, or renovation. They have been provisionally
named by the local media as Shin-Shinto, or New-New party.
Nobody has suggested a catchier alternative, though a Y200,000 (Pounds
1,273) mystery gift from the opposition and a tour of parliament awaits the
winner of a public competition to find one. The razzmatazz surrounding the
birth of the New-New party, or whatever it will be called, is a consequence
of the sharper competition for power emerging ahead of a new electoral
system and tougher controls on fund raising to take effect from January.
The old system, in which assiduously cultivated personal relationships are
what counts, is being challenged by the vote-catching smile of Ms Hosokawa
and the public image of her professional political colleagues. Ideologies on
each side are about the same, so presentation is what matters. This is
starting to look like a US election campaign, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun daily
complains.
To accuse Japanese politics of becoming like the US may be looking a long
way ahead. Yet it is true that the the present 13-party Babel that inhabits
Japan's lower house of parliament is embarking on the final stage of the
search for a more orderly balance of power. It might even, say supporters of
reform, pave the way for an ideological debate about Japan's future.
All involved in Japan's political realignment know they must complete their
regrouping soon. This is partly because the new system, which favours large
parties, will take effect (barring the unexpected) in two months. To add to
the urgency, Japan faces local elections next April, followed by elections
for half the upper house in July. A general election could come at any time,
depending on the whim of the government and the New-New party's skill in
wooing defectors from the ruling side.
So it is that the old and some new relationships on both sides of parliament
have been melted fast by Ms Hosokawa's smile and by the political heat to
come. Soka Gakkai, the influential Buddhist movement, announced last week
that it will abandon its traditionally exclusive support for Komeito, the
Clean Government party, which Soka Gakkai formed 30 years ago and is now a
mainstay of the opposition.
Mr Koshiro Ishida, Komeito's leader, even said he would support a former LDP
man as candidate for leadership of the New-New party , so removing one of
the main obstacles to agreement on a leader for the opposition nine. Main
candidates include Mr Hata and Mr Toshiki Kaifu, another ex-prime minister.
Both are former LDP heavyweights.
Existing alliances are similarly up for renegotiation among the three-party
ruling alliance of LDP, Social Democratic party and New Harbinger party,
former enemies who joined forces last June to oust Mr Hata's coalition
government. The shared interests of the three government parties are
surprisingly strong, thanks to the SDP's decision to dump most of its old
foreign, defence and fiscal policies. Yet, gutted of its core ideologies,
the SDP now looks ready to implode.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the first SDP prime minister in 47 years, admitted as
much recently when he assented to plans by his party's majority right wing
to form yet another new party. This would embrace like-minded politicians
from government and opposition, of obvious interest as a potential ally for
the new-new party.
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, power behind the scenes of the New-New party, is
tentatively seeking to woo the SDP defectors to cross the floor of the house
and rejoin him, just as the SDP did, to its regret, in the previous two
coalition governments.
According to Tokyo political gossip, Mr Sadao Yamahana, leader of the
defectors from the right-wing of the socialists, might be offered the chance
of becoming prime minister of a future New-New party government, to help him
make up his mind whose side to join.
The prospect of a new government under a prime minister from the same party
as the old one might sound fanciful. Yet it illustrates the high-stakes
bargaining now under way as Japan's fragmented political factions struggle
to reorganise along clearer lines.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Criminal gun rules 'free' Cambodia: After 23 years of civil
war nearly everyone is armed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Benoit Duchateau-Arminjon's La Casa restaurant in Phnom Penh set up the
Cambodian capital's first pizza delivery service in September. The trouble
is, last orders have to be phoned in well before 8pm because even La Casa's
pizzas are not worth dying for.
Mr Duchateau-Arminjon says it is too dangerous for his staff to be out on
their Hondas after eight. The pages of the Phnom Penh newspapers testify to
the alarming murder rate in the capital. Just about every day people are
shot dead just for their mopeds.
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the senior prime minister, has tired of what he
sees as the negative reporting of security in his country. He frequently
lectures journalists on comparative crime rates around the world. Violent
crime in New York, he asserted recently, was 10,000 times worse than in
Cambodia.
But such dubious statistics provide cold comfort to those unfortunate enough
to be caught in one of the capital's terrifying regular gun-battles. Last
month an attempted motorcycle robbery erupted into a small war outside this
correspondent's house in suburban Phnom Penh. It was the third shooting
incident in the street in as many weeks.
For 15 minutes, bullets ricocheted off the road and gateposts. A waiting
taxi was caught in the gunfire. Its windows were shot out and it was riddled
with bullets. Local residents who did not join the fray threw themselves
down on their floors. Amazingly no one was hit.
In modern Cambodia, gun law rules: nearly everyone owns one, and to prove it
they all fire into the clouds during thunderstorms. After 23 years of civil
war, it is a buyers' market when it comes to procuring weapons, ammunition
and explosives. Anyone can buy a Kalashnikov assault rifle and a clip of
ammunition for Dollars 50 on the black market.
The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Cambodia finished just over a
year ago. It was hailed as a success because the UN had supervised elections
which installed a democratic government. But the UN failed to deliver on its
mandate in one vital area: its peacekeepers did not demobilise the four
factions, whose armies were still armed to the teeth.
The Khmer Rouge have returned to the battlefield and remain a threat to
national security. But the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces - an amalgamation of
the three other factions - are just as dangerous. Unpaid and undisciplined,
they roam the countryside, terrorising villagers, extorting money, running
protection rackets, robbing, looting and killing.
Last month a report by Mr John Holloway, the former Australian ambassador to
Cambodia, was leaked to the press. In his assessment of the security
situation he wrote: 'Rural villagers are more scared of government forces
than they are of the Khmer Rouge.' Few informed observers would disagree.
'Power belongs to those who have guns,' says a human rights investigator in
Phnom Penh. 'The military are predators in this country: 60 to 70 per cent
of abuses against the population are committed by the armed forces, but they
are outside the law.'
Earlier this year, a UN human rights report alleged that the powerful
military intelligence bureau was involved in organised crime, contract
killing, torture and extrajudicial execution in the north-western province
of Battambang. Senior military officers were directly implicated.
None of those named in that report was sacked. Human rights groups say
government investigations have been nothing but whitewash. Their conclusion:
that the lack of political will to stop such criminal activity reflects the
government's fear that it will not receive western military aid if the
allegation sticks.
The many local and international human rights groups operating in Cambodia
say the army is out of control. Many of the reported motorcycle and car
thefts in the capital involve men in military uniforms. Last month a Land
Cruiser was stolen from one UN agency. It turned up in a villa owned by a
colonel from military intelligence.
What is more worrying is that bundles of documented circumstantial evidence
point to the fact that the rise in violent crime is being used to camouflage
politically motivated killings. The outspoken editor of a popular
Khmer-language newspaper was shot dead in broad daylight recently as he rode
his motorcycle along a busy Phnom Penh street. Local journalists live in
fear.
The next day, a car belonging to a UN human rights centre employee was
stolen at gunpoint. The employee's five-year-old daughter was abducted and
shot in the leg. The centre concluded that the attack was more than a car
theft gone wrong. Other human rights groups believe the incident was in
reprisal for the centre's report on military abuses in Battambang.
No one has been arrested for either crime. 'And no one will be,' says a
human rights worker. 'Because the problem is, they'll say who ordered them
to do it.' There are rumours that those behind the killings occupy
untouchable positions within the political or military hierarchy.
The hands of police investigators might be tied, but the forces of law and
order also have a pitiful reputation. The police run protection rackets too
and some local residents find they have been mysteriously burgled when they
do not pay up. Drunken officers are often trigger-happy too.
Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world and the rewards of
violent crime are considered worth the risks - which are not so high given
that criminals can buy their way out of a murder charge for less than
Dollars 3,000. The cost of hiring a contract killer is much less.
As one Cambodian political analyst puts it: 'Today we have democracy, a free
press and a free market, but people now ask how free we really are.' The
Cambodian people - who for successive generations have lived under god
kings, military dictators, fanatical Maoists and communists - have been left
to conclude that liberty is anarchy.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Japan's TV ratings row worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A row in Japan over television audience ratings is set to intensify with the
launch today by Nielsen Japan, the Japanese arm of the US research group, of
an automated system which measures individual viewing.
Although Japan has the world's second largest television advertising market,
marketing techniques used by advertising agencies and corporate advertisers
are said to be unsophisticated compared to other developed markets, as
television ratings have been based on viewing households rather than
individuals.
Nielsen's plan, announced in August, has met strong opposition from the
country's large television networks and leading advertising agencies, which
own shares in Video Research, a television ratings company which has held a
virtual monopoly of the business.
Some networks, including Nippon Television Network, are threatening to end
existing contracts with Nielsen which supplement Video Research's data,
unless the ratings group backs off from its plan.
Advertisers and foreign advertising agencies, on the other hand, are
supporting Nielsen's move. They have been frustrated by the lack of market
research and feel the changes, which will give them timely data on the age
and gender group of programme viewers, are long overdue.
Bates Japan, part of the Saatchi and Saatchi advertising group, became the
first advertising agency to subscribe to the Nielsen service being offered
from today. 'We simply owe it to our clients to give them the most accurate
information available about their media investment,' said Mr Kim Walker,
president of Bates Japan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Solomon Islands was without a prime minister yesterday after Mr Francis
Billy Hilly resigned 18 days after refusing to step down when sacked by the
governor-general. 'I have decided it is finally time to allow for a change
in the leadership of the government,' Mr Hilly told parliament in the
capital, Honiara. It is unclear who will become the new prime minister. The
former prime minister (now opposition leader) Mr Solomon Mamaloni had been
sworn in as a caretaker premier on October 25. But it was unclear if Mr
Mamaloni's caretaker role remained valid following Mr Hilly's resignation.
Governor-General Moses Pitakaka was yet to make a statement on Mr Hilly's
resignation, and is now expected to call for nominations. Political analysts
say Mr Hilly's stance against alleged exploitation of tropical forests by
foreign logging companies had caused his loss of support. His resignation
ended almost three weeks of political crisis, which at times meant the
country had two prime ministers.

Newport News Shipbuilding said yesterday it had become the first US shipyard
since 1957 to win a foreign commercial ship order when it signed a contract
with Eletson Corp, a Greek shipping company, for two 46,000 ton tankers. The
contract also includes an option for two more tankers, and follows the US
Transportation Department's approval of a loan guarantee to Eletson. The
first of the two vessels, which can carry up to 343,000 barrels of oil, is
due to be delivered in 22 months. Newport News has been heavily dependent on
naval shipbuilding orders, but Tenneco, its parent company, has been seeking
to diversify into commercial shipbuilding.

A flamboyant philosophy professor appears to have wrestled the mayoralty of
Colombia's capital Bogota from the ruling Liberal party in the biggest upset
in Sunday's municipal and provincial elections. Partial results showed Mr
Antanas Mockus, beating his Liberal opponent by a wide margin. Mr Mockus
conducted an unconventional campaign, placing no paid advertising and
erecting only four advertising hoardings in a city of nearly 7m people. He
also cancelled all public appearances during the past week saying people
were saturated with elections. Early returns from the rest of Colombia
showed the Liberal party holding on to power and remaining the dominant
political force in this country of nearly 36m people. However, the
traditional Liberal and Conservative parties lost a number of cities to
candidates backed by civic fronts.

<TEXT>
US personal income rose in September for the eighth month in a row, the
Commerce Department reported yesterday, but consumption spending, though
still increasing, showed some signs of weakening. Personal income rose by
0.6 per cent in September from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of Dollars 5,756.7bn as wage and salary income continued to advance.
Disposable income, after deducting tax payments and some other non-tax
payments, also rose by 0.6 per cent. Personal consumption expenditures,
however, rose only 0.2 per cent in September after gaining 0.8 per cent in
August. Spending on durable goods, which had surged in August, fell slightly
as car purchases tailed off, while spending on services and non-durable
goods continued to rise. In a separate announcement the Purchasing
Management Association of Chicago said its index of business activity rose
to 64.3 per cent in October from 63.3 per cent the previous month. The
association said its index of prices paid by businesses rose to 72.5 per
cent from 72.1 per cent in September.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Cuba opens up to more investment from overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PASCAL FLETCHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba is to open up more of its recession-hit economy to foreign investment,
including real estate, services and sugar production.
Vice-President Carlos Lage told a news conference in Havana at the weekend
that the government was also preparing a new foreign investment law that
would give more protection to overseas investors, who are already active in
Cuba in activities ranging from oil exploration to citrus production.
Cuba began opening up its state-run economy to external investment after
1989 to offset the devastating impact of the collapse of its preferential
trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc.
'From now onwards, no productive sector will be excluded from investment by
foreign capital,' Mr Lage said. Up to now, raw sugar production,
traditionally the island's biggest export earner, had been explicitly closed
to foreign investment. But the sugar industry is in deep crisis and has
suffered two consecutive disastrously low harvests.
Mr Lage also announced that, in defiance of a continuing US economic embargo
against Cuba, representatives of more than 69 US companies had visited the
island in the first half of this year to discuss business prospects.
In some cases, letters of intent for future contracts had been negotiated to
take effect when the US embargo was finally lifted by Washington.
Representatives of two British sugar companies, Tate &amp; Lyle, and ED&amp;F Man,
have held talks this year with Cuban investment officials.
Shortages of essential inputs previously supplied by the former Soviet
Union, such as fuel, spare parts, fertilisers and herbicides, have crippled
Cuba's sugar production since 1990.
On Cuba's economy, Mr Lage said it was still too early to talk of recovery.
But he cited some positive signs, such as the growth of foreign investment,
particularly in tourism and oil exploration, improvements in construction,
cement and nickel production and progress in the government's efforts to
stabilise the country's internal finances.

FT  01 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Clinton seeks to stem
party losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton yesterday launched a week-long drive to minimise
expected Democratic party losses in the mid-term elections on November 8. Mr
David Wilhelm, the party's national chairman, travelled with the president
to Philadelphia and proclaimed 'the tide is turning.' But he added that he
was under no illusion how tough the elections would be.
Indeed, in the first three states on Mr Clinton's itinerary - Pennsylvania,
Ohio and Michigan - polls found Democratic candidates falling behind
Republican opponents in seats the party already holds.
In Pennsylvania, a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette survey gave Congressman Rick
Santorum, the Republican, a 46-35 point lead over Senator Harris Wofford.
Though the poll had a small sample, with a margin of error of plus or minus
5 per cent, and was dismissed as unreliable by the senator's campaign, the
two had previously appeared neck-and-neck.
As an indication of the importance Republicans attach to the state, Mr
Santorum was chosen to give the party's official response to the president's
regular weekly radio broadcast on Saturday. He charged that the Democrats
had secret plans to raise taxes and said 'it is time for you to tell
Washington that you want to keep your hard-earned income.'
In Michigan Mr Spence Abraham, the Republican, was given a 46-34 lead over
Congressman Bob Carr. Another survey a week ago had given the Democrat a
small lead, but the popularity of Governor John Engler, the Republican
certain of re-election, appears to be pulling Mr Abraham along.
All the recent Ohio surveys show Lt Governor Michael DeWine with a double
digit lead over Mr Joel Hyatt, who is bidding to succeed his father-in-law,
Senator Howard Metzenbaum. Mr Hyatt has started to dig into his own
considerable private resources to finance a last-minute drive but most
experts consider it too little and too late.
But both Mr Hyatt and Congressman Carr are to campaign with Mr Clinton
today, in contrast to the president's previous visit, when both shunned him.
Mr Mark Singel, now apparently trailing as the Democratic candidate for
governor in Pennsylvania, also appeared with the president yesterday having
failed to show up last month at a Washington fundraiser on his behalf at
which Mr Clinton was present.
The president's upwards move in the polls on the strength of foreign policy
achievements may help his party, though by how much is unclear. Mr William
Schneider, political analyst for the CNN-USA Today-Gallup national poll,
said recently that every 2 point rise in the president's popularity was
worth a seat in the House and every 8 points one in the Senate. By that
logic, Mr Clinton has just saved four House seats and one in the Senate.
In New York the Democrats were able to take heart from the latest large
sample New York Times/WCBS-TV poll out yesterday which gave Governor Mario
Cuomo a 44-34 point lead over Mr George Pataki.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Nicaragua limps back to life: The first expected growth year
since the 1970s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD ORLEBAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicaragua is expected to grow this year, a rare occurrence for an economy
that has been in almost unremitting decline since the late 1970s, as a
semblance of political stability gains a foothold.
But the economic expansion remains anaemic and there is little confidence
that the economy has taken a decisive turn for the better. Growth is
unlikely to exceed 1.5 per cent this year, less than population growth at
around 3 per cent. Unemployment is 60 per cent.
Relative peace, and measures aimed at developing a market economy after the
defeat of the left-wing Sandinistas in 1990 have not, so far at least,
brought the economic benefits that the government has periodically promised.
Mr Oscar Rene Vargas, an economist, points to a drop in income per head of
48 per cent in the last five years. 'This is the 'Africanisation' of
Nicaragua,' he says. 'We won't be able to return to the levels of 1989 for
25 years.'
The country's foreign debt - at Dollars 11bn, more than eight times gross
national product - is still a heavy burden. The government secured in June
an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility with the International Monetary
Fund, which gives it access to Dollars 150m a year until 1997, and the
possibility to renegotiate debt with Paris Club creditors. But about 80 per
cent of liquid foreign loans go towards debt service.
Meanwhile, Nicaragua is running a large trade deficit, has negligible
reserves, an agricultural sector suffering from drought, and a virtually
non-existent industrial sector. Even the machetes, the essential tool of any
agricultural labourer, are imported from El Salvador.
But observers say there are some signs of encouragement. Although, many
rural areas in the north are still plagued with banditry, the last group of
organised rebels negotiated an agreement with the government in April.
Congress has passed a military code which strengthens civilian authority
over the armed forces and gives the president the right to dismiss the
defence chief.
Higher international coffee prices should push revenue above Dollars 100m in
1995 and total exports to more than Dollars 300m. Some foreign investment
has begun to flow towards the energy sector, tourism, and gold mining.
The national telephone company, Telcor, which has markedly improved its
service, is expected to be privatised by the end of the year. The sea-food
industry grew by 60 per cent last year.
'We believe there are significant opportunities here,' says Mr Eduardo
Montealegre, general manager of Bancentro, one of nine private banks to open
since 1991. 'We have changed the direction of things and the direction we
are going in is the right one,' he says.
Some analysts, however, still see fundamental change needed in other areas:
in the unreformed public sector - a loan to cover this is being negotiated
with the World Bank - and in the financial sector, where the state banks are
in desperate condition.
Furthermore, though the country's political divisions are less marked than
they appeared a couple of years ago, there is concern that presidential
elections in November 1995 are already beginning to sour the political
climate.
A split has emerged among leading members of the Sandinista National
Liberation Front between a modernising wing of the party and the
authoritarian leadership of Mr Daniel Ortega - a probable presidential
candidate - and other hardliners who have maintained left-wing rhetoric.
One manifestation of this is a division within the party over a proposed
constitutional reform intended to make the executive more accountable to the
legislature. The reform would among other things prohibit the immediate
re-election of the president, shorten the term from six to five years, and
ban close relatives from standing for election.
Observers say Mr Ortega wishes to negotiate a property law which would
legalise Sandinista ownership of some properties confiscated during its
administration in the 1980s. In return, they say, he would be willing to
support the removal of the proposed bar on presidential relatives seeking
re-election. This would allow the man described as Nicaragua's de facto
prime minister, Mr Antonio Lacayo - the minister of the presidency and
President Violeta Chamorro's son-in-law - to run for office too.

<TEXT>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma yesterday consolidated his grip on
economic policy by naming a radical reformer, Mr Viktor Pynzanek, as first
deputy prime minister for economics. The appointment of Mr Pynzanek, who
quit the same post in frustration last year when Mr Kuchma was prime
minister, undercuts the conservative prime minister, Mr Vitaly Masol. Mr
Masol, who was strongly criticised by Mr Kuchma yesterday for trying to
obstruct last week's unification of the currency exchange rates, had said
any appointment to that economics portfolio would weaken his own position.
Mr Kuchma promised further austerity measures soon and progress toward a new
constitution. He commented: 'I'm ready to compromise on all issues except
economic reform and executive power.' He also urged parliament to ratify the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty because, he said, economic help from both
Russia and the west depended on it.

Mr Boris Yeltsin has proposed that Mrs Tatyana Paramonova, presently acting
governor of the Russian Central Bank, be confirmed in her post. He has sent
his recommendation on her candidacy to the state duma for debate and
ratification in the latter half of this month. Mrs Paramonova, the youngest
member of the bank's senior management and the sole woman member, was named
acting governor after the resignation of Mr Victor Gerashchenko from the
governorship last month following the dramatic fall in the rouble. An
investigatory commission specially appointed by the government is due to
report tomorrow on what caused the plunge in the Russian currency.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
More than a third of Russia's industrial workforce is in 'hidden
unemployment' and many others are not being paid or have had their wages
cut, according to a report published yesterday by the International Labour
Organisation. Moreover, open unemployment in Russia - based on standard
international definitions - is at least five times as high as the official
figures, based on registrations of under 2 per cent, the report said.
Enterprises have cut jobs for the fourth year running from mid-1993 to
mid-1994, by an average of more than 8 per cent. However, 35 per cent of
those still 'in work' had no job to do. These included those on involuntary
short-time working and those - a fifth of all industrial workers - on
long-term 'administrative leave' receiving little or no wages. The existence
of hidden unemployment was a rational response by managers who would
otherwise have to pay wages or severance pay, said the report's author, Mr
Guy Standing. Even so, nearly half the enterprises surveyed by the ILO were
in wage arrears and more than 60 per cent had not paid wages in full. Mr
Standing said official figures showing a rise in average real wages referred
to contractual wages and not those actually paid. 'Across the board, many
workers are taking home much less, if they are taking home anything,' he
said. Mr Standing called for enforceable labour contracts and a more
comprehensive and generous social protection system to aid the process of
enterprise restructuring and to cushion hardship.

Poland's foreign minister, Mr Andrzej Olechowski, who resigned last week
after being placed on a list of top government officials who also hold
directorships, has suspended his resignation while the courts clarify if he
was breaking the law. Asked in a newspaper interview what he would do if the
courts decided against him or the issue was not clarified by the end of the
year, he replied: 'I will leave.' The list of 68 senior officials was
published last week by Mr Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, justice minister, who
argued that they contravened a 1981 law banning government officials from
accepting pay from other sources. Mr Olechowski, who was nominated by
President Lech Walesa, has also denied that he will run against him in next

Norway's current account surplus for the first eight months of 1994 fell to
NKr13.853bn (Pounds 1.3bn) from NKr16.757bn in the same 1993 period,
according to the country's national statistics agency. The 17 per cent fall
reflected a drop in the value of oil and gas exports, to NKr68.6bn from
NKr70.1bn, as well as lower net exports of ships and oil platforms. Imports
have also risen strongly on the back of the recovery in the Norwegian
economy, which will grow by around 4 per cent this year. In August, the
current account swung to a deficit of NKr570m, compared with a July surplus
of NKr1.833bn. The turnaround was due to oilfield maintenance work which
pushed down the value of Norway's August oil exports to NKr6.6bn from
NKr8.5bn in the same 1993 period. Christopher Brown-Humes, Stockholm
Wholesale sales in Germany in September dropped a real 1 per cent
year-on-year and fell a calendar and seasonally-adjusted real 1 per cent

Greek industrial production rose 4.2 per cent year-on-year in August after a

Slovakia's industrial output in August rose by 5.8 per cent compared with

FT  01 NOV 94 / European Profile: Milosevic's wife brings their enemies to
book

The annual Belgrade book fair last week awarded first prize to a literary
novice, Mrs Mira Markovic, better known as the wife of President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia.
The award marks the rise of Mrs Markovic, who has become increasingly
prominent in the Serbian political scene over the past few months.
Her hand can be detected in Mr Milosevic's current moves towards peace with
Croatia. She is behind Serbia's embargo against the Bosnian Serbs.
Mrs Markovic had made public her aversion towards Mr Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, a year before the Serbian president turned his back on
his protege.
The first lady of Serbia makes her views known by publishing her diaries in
Duga, the most popular Serbian magazine. Her book, 'Night and Day', is a
compilation of these musings which have heralded the demise of many
politicians - from Mr Karadzic to Mr Vojislav Seselj, the ultra-nationalist
MP, who last week was sentenced to three months in prison.
While her diaries provide a stage for settling political scores with her
husband's rivals - often erstwhile allies - they also ponder the beauty of
crickets, summertime, and ethnic tolerance.
Her book, said one critic, 'is polyphonic, a combination of scientific
analysis and poetic sensibility'.
After his Machiavellian turn-around three months ago, Mr Milosevic is poised
to purge nationalists from the ranks of Serbia's ruling Socialists (SPS) -
or at least get rid of those who had made the mistake of speaking too loudly
in favour of the war in Bosnia. This was portended by Mrs Milosevic, who
attacked Mr Mihajlo Markovic, the main Socialist ideologue.
'Mr Markovic betrayed her revolution by being too soft on the Serbs on the
other side of the Drina,' the river which marks Serbia's frontier with
Bosnia, wrote the Belgrade journalist Mr Milivoje Glisic,
In last month's column, Mrs Markovic warned Mr Markovic, her former
professor, that she 'has many comrades in the SPS, maybe many more than
Mihajlo Markovic. . . The only thing that my professor may be right about is
that he should not wage polemics with his former students and he especially
should not get angry if they are better than him.'
With her husband abandoning nationalism, Mrs Markovic has founded Jul
(Yugoslav United Left), a shadowy organisation including her university
students and retired generals. Indeed, writes Mr Stojan Cerovic, the
respected Belgrade journalist, 'the literary jury this time perhaps did not
want to reward only the skill or the good taste of Mrs Markovic in picking
her spouse, but also her efforts in rallying the left'.
Mr Milosevic's political shift has effectively marginalised the tiny liberal
opposition and radicalised the rest even more. While Mrs Markovic says she
supported peace all along, her husband was blamed by the west for being the
chief instigator of the war.
His recent moves have won kudos from international peace envoys and the
lifting of some UN sanctions, which give him a freer hand in Serbia.
While Mr Glisic wryly expressed relief that the Belgrade book fair was free
of political influence, the award signalled the extent to which the
Milosevics rule Serbia.
'If everything gets worse, Mrs Markovic will become all the greater writer,'
said Mr Cerovic, 'in the end, perhaps, the only writer whose books are
printed.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Brittan finds solace in past achievement: Commissioner
claims some credit for E Europe's advance towards EU entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

<TEXT>
It was with a certain savagery that Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior
European commissioner, yesterday described the EU's progress to date in
embracing former communist countries of east and central Europe.
'We have taken a quantum leap towards bringing the countries of east and
central Europe into the European Union and it is for me personally a cause
of great satisfaction and pride that we have been able to do so,' he said.
Two days after learning that the prize task of negotiating Europe's
enlargement to the east had been lopped off his Brussels portfolio, the
smarting commissioner took the opportunity of an EU foreign ministers'
meeting in Luxembourg - attended by ministers from six east European
countries - to sum up the great strides taken since Berlin's wall was
knocked down.
No one was left in any doubt whom to thank: 'The reason why we were able to
have a meeting of substance today was because of the work that has already
taken place. . . a great deal has been done and the countries are now set
formally on the path towards membership of the EU.'
But in spite of his evident irritation and disappointment, Sir Leon held
fire and did not announce a resignation. Evidently friends, supporters and
most especially the British government - horrified at the prospect of
further domestic turmoil over Europe - had been to work on him.
As Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, put it: 'I am extremely glad that
he has decided to stay on in the Commission.'
Sir Leon himself was putting on a brave face: 'After the conclusion of the
Uruguay Round of the Gatt negotiation, I turned myself increasingly to the
affairs of eastern and central Europe of the former Soviet Union, so I was
naturally disappointed,' he said.
'But I have received messages from governments asking me to stay on,' he
said. 'The portfolio I have been offered does represent an important and
major challenge. . . I am under no illusion about the magnitude of that
task.'
Mr Hurd and Sir Leon himself were not the only people praising the former
conservative MP's two-year efforts as commissioner responsible for central
and eastern Europe. Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said: 'I have
thanked Sir Leon for the excellent work done in producing a strategy paper
which has in part prepared the way for accession.'
There were diplomatic words, too, from the Polish foreign minister, Mr
Andrezj Olechowski. 'We were very pleased with the work done by Sir Leon. We
think he was, and continues to be, convinced about the future membership of
our country and has done a great deal of work and made much contribution,'
he said.
But as he tactfully put it, the east Europeans were not losing a friend as a
result of Mr Jacques Santer's division of labour, they were merely gaining a
new one. 'We have no reason to think the new commissioner will not be as
enthusiastic and able as the other.'
Sir Leon is not a stranger to controversial, news-shattering resignations
following his role in the Westland helicopter dispute of the Thatcher
government. Yesterday he took unkindly to suggestions that he should have
acted more decisively this time round. 'Maybe you have always found it easy
to make big personal decisions,' he snapped at one journalist. 'Not
everybody is in that happy situation.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / German insurers face price-fixing inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's federal Cartel Office is investigating the country's leading
insurance companies, which are alleged to have been running a price-fixing
system for car rentals in order to reduce insurance payouts to their
clients.
The price-fixing system is claimed to have been set up last December when
six insurance companies founded a car rental company called Carpartner.
In Germany, insurance policyholders expect to be able to hire immediately a
temporary vehicle at the insurer's expense after an accident.
The Cartel Office suspects that the system was established to reduce car
rental costs that insurers believed were excessive.
'The idea was that if you had a car accident, you would apply to your
insurance company for a replacement car,' claimed Mr Jurgen Kiecker, the
spokesman for the Cartel Office.
In this case, Mr Kiecker said, 'the insurance companies agreed on the car
rental prices among each other, subsidised the rent and generally insisted
that the client should rent only from Carpartner'.
The Cartel Office admits the arrangement would have had the effect of
reducing the cost of car rentals, while the customer's car was off the road.
'But that is not the issue,' he said. 'The issue is price-fixing and that is
what we are investigating.'
None of the insurers was available for comment yesterday.
Over time, more than 60 other insurance companies are said to have joined
the scheme in an effort to reduce their payouts.
The Cartel Office started investigating Carpartner last Tuesday, and the
company has voluntarily provided documents to the authorities.
Mr Kiecker would not say what sparked the investigation, but the Cartel
Office has become more aggressive in probing price-fixing allegations in
recent months.
Germany's rental car replacement market is one of the biggest in Europe.
Unlike in Britain, where the majority of cars are rented on an individual
private basis, in Germany about 50 per cent of all rented cars are
replacement vehicles.
Germany's conservative and liberal parties, still trying to put together a
new coalition two weeks after they were returned to power with a slim
majority, yesterday added taxes to the list of issues on which they
disagree, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and leader of the right-wing Christian
Social Union, said talks were making good progress and could be concluded
this week. But the liberal Free Democrats, junior partner in the
centre-right government, said they remained unhappy about a new income tax
surcharge and would not be rushed into an early coalition deal.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Mavrodi's millions pay dividends with voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Sergei Mavrodi, the multimillionaire charged with tax evasion whose MMM
pyramid selling company crashed in the summer, has been elected to the
Russian parliament, according to early figures last night. He was backed by
Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democrats (LDP).
It was the first important by-election for a state duma (lower house) seat
since last December's poll produced a surge of support for the LDP. The
result was the more remarkable since Mr Mavrodi did not make a single
appearance in his Mytishci constituency, an industrial suburb of Moscow.
However, members of his staff had worked the area for weeks before,
promising that their boss would spend Dollars 10m of his own money improving
it.
Mr Mavrodi, released from jail three weeks ago in accordance with the law on
elections granting immunity to candidates and deputies, had told the
electors on the eve of the poll that 'your only solution is to elect me
because then I will be immune from further arrest. I will not have to return
to prison'.
However, Mr Gennady Ponomaryov, the Moscow prosecutor, said last night that
'the legal case against Mr Mavrodi would not be terminated automatically'.
Since the case - for tax evasion by his Invest Consulting firm - had begun
before he stood as a deputy, it could continue without an appeal to the Duma
to remove his immunity.
According to Mr Sergei Taranov, Mr Mavrodi's spokesman, the new deputy would
bring together a group of members of parliament dedicated to 'defend the
interests of the shareholders of Russia and defend them from the
uncontrollable arbitrariness of government bureaucrats'.
The campaign had been remarkable both for the absence of Mr Mavrodi and the
presence at the election rallies of black-clothed, swastika-wearing
paramilitaries who turned out to greet the candidate of the Russian National
Unity (fascist) party, Mr Alexander Fyodorov, with Nazi salutes. However,
neither Mr Fyodorov nor Mr Andrei Sidelnikov, representative of the
rightwing Derzhava movement led by former Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi,
appeared to have scored well.
The early figures showed Mr Mavrodi capturing around 28 per cent of the
vote, with Mr Alexander Zharov, an official of the local administration,
taking around 15 per cent, and Mr Konstantin Borovoi, a prominent financier
and leader of the Economic Freedom party, around 14 per cent. Mr Borovoi had
been a particular target of Mr Fyodorov's supporters, who mocked him with
anti-semitic insults at rallies.
Though Mr Mavrodi has said he does not intend to ally himself to any faction
in the Duma, his campaign was partly run by the LDP. In return, the party
can expect to gain access not just to his fortune but to the famed skills of
his company's television production studio. The latter made the series of
advertisements promoting MMM which persuaded hundreds of thousands of
Russians to buy its shares as they climbed dizzily earlier this year.
Turnout at the election was around 30 per cent - comfortably above the 25
per cent threshold to make the vote a valid one.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Zeiss 'marriage' a unification story ending in tears: Judy
Dempsey chronicles the troubled amalgamation of the east and west arms of
the German optical instruments manufacturer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The marriage seemed a good idea at the time, says Mr Jurgen Domel, head of
the workers' council at Carl Zeiss Jena, the renowned eastern German
manufacturer of microscopes, telescopes and optical instruments.
'We had the name. We had the freedom to enter the western markets. We were
confident.'
There is little evidence of that confidence in Jena today as the management
in Carl Zeiss Oberkochen in the nearby western German state of
Baden-Wurttemberg prepares to cut 2,400 jobs from its 13,000 strong pay-roll
in its west German operations and 600 of the 2,050 workforce in Jena, an old
university town set deep in the eastern state of Thuringia.
The marriage between the eastern and western parts of Carl Zeiss was
arranged by the Treuhand privatisation agency in late 1991. Hailed as an
exemplary solution for saving Carl Zeiss Jena, it sought to combine both
enterprises under one roof after 45 years of enforced separation.
Under the plan, Oberkochen took 51 per cent of Carl Zeiss Jena, while the
remaining 49 per cent was placed under Jenoptik, also in Jena. Jenoptik,
which specialises in high-tech laser and optical instruments and is managed
by Mr Lothar Spath, the former prime minister of Baden-Wurttemberg, is 100
per cent owned by the government of Thuringia.
In addition, to save and modernise the entire Carl Zeiss complex, which
before unification employed more than 27,000 workers, the Treuhand allocated
DM3.6bn (Pounds 1.47bn) of taxpayers' money to Jenoptik with the aim of
guaranteeing 10,000 jobs and finding new markets. As for Carl Zeiss Jena, by
the end of next year the Treuhand will have pumped in DM587m and kept 2,050
jobs alive.
But, laments Mr Elk Littow, manager of Carl Zeiss Jena, 'We invested about
DM117m on new buildings and production lines and the remainder has been
spent on picking up losses.'
Despite introducing new production lines, Carl Zeiss Jena has been making
annual losses of about DM140m on a turnover of DM206m, while productivity is
still only 40 per cent of Oberkochen's.
Recession hit domestic and export markets for the group products before its
top heavy management had time to react. 'Yes, we have over-employment,' says
Mr Littow. 'But one of the problems is that the expected markets did not
materialise. After unification, we lost all our east European and Russian
outlets. Half our current sales to the east - a quarter of our total
turnover - are now financed by Hermes (Germany's export guarantee state
insurance company).'
Mr Littow also concedes it had been difficult to integrate Carl Zeiss Jena
with Oberkochen. 'We are still making some of the same product lines
although we have tried to phase them out'.
Indeed, the duplication of product lines is considered one of the main
problems in this marriage. But these are linked to what happened to Carl
Zeiss after 1945.
In July 1945, American troops, which had advanced into Thuringia just before
the Red Army, whisked away 127 scientists from Carl Zeiss Jena to the
western zone, and with them, they helped re-establish Carl Zeiss at
Oberkochen. The remainder of the world-renowned optics and glass enterprise,
which had been founded in 1889 by Ernst Abbe and Otto Schott, was brought
under state control once the east German communists consolidated their grip
over eastern Germany in 1949. The real struggle for the Carl Zeiss name
began in earnest.
For more than 45 years both Carl Zeiss' produced the same goods. As
Oberkochen captured the western markets with its high-quality microscopes,
telescopes and optical instruments, Jena went eastwards with similar
products.
'It was a struggle between east and west Germany to preserve the name and
the products,' says Mr Domel. 'Over that time, the buyers at Carl Zeiss
Oberkochen were taught to believe they were the real inheritors of Carl
Zeiss Jena. Since unification, we in Jena have been trying to recapture our
place on the international markets through the marriage with Oberkochen,' he
adds.
Yet Mr Domel believes Oberkochen does not want Carl Zeiss Jena to exist. 'We
are supposed to be able to market our goods through their distribution
network. But we sell more products through our own outlets than through
Oberkochen. It's a psychological problem for their marketing people who now
have to think about marketing the Jena products. I don't want to believe
that this is a struggle between Wessis (west Germans) and Ossis (east
Germans). But it is hard to think otherwise, especially since Oberkochen
makes the decisions,' he says.
'Look, there was no attempt to integrate Jena and Oberkochen and streamline
the product lines,' says Mr Willy Theiracker, a member of Oberkochen's
workers' council. 'There was a duplication of product lines. We have been
warning the management at Oberkochen for years to restructure. They reacted
too late. Of course we fear about jobs going to the east. But we don't want
to make this into an east-west struggle.'
The group's profit and loss account tells just that story, however. Of
operating losses of DM180m in 1993/94, DM140m is attributable to Jena.
And the east-west tensions have been heightened by the group's precarious
situation. Workers protesting at the western plants about the restructuring
programme last week waved banners proclaiming: 'Aufbau Ost, Abbau West. Wir
sagen nein' (Building in the east, dismissals in the West. We say no).
Oberkochen, which last year had a turnover of DM2.5bn, is now making DM40m
losses.
But since it owns 51 per cent of Carl Zeiss Jena, managers at Oberkochen
believe they will have a freer hand to control losses at that plant in late
1995 when the Treuhand's investment and job guarantee contracts for saving
2,050 jobs expire.
However, Mr Bernd Kramer, head of the physical technologies department at
the federal ministry for research and technology in Bonn, believes the real
problem facing Carl Zeiss is its price structure and growing competition,
particularly from the south-Asian markets.
'Carl Zeiss is definitely under pressure from these markets. But anyone
buying these top-class instruments have to find a balance between price and
quality. Also, if Carl Zeiss wants to become more competitive, the
management will have to respond more quickly. It is not yet flexible enough
in this field,' adds Mr Kramer.
Treuhand and Thuringian government officials agree. They say the
difficulties in integrating the eastern and western operations is partly due
to inflexible management as well as the problems in marrying two companies
which had developed two different marketing philosophies over the past 40
years. That, however, is of little comfort to the taxpayer.
'I keep asking myself what happened to the DM587m of tax-payers money,' says
Mr Wilfried Rudolf, a spokesman for the Thuringian government. But he
declined to explain why the state did not earlier question the losses since
it has an indirect ownership interest in Carl Zeiss Jena through Jenoptik.
'The big deciding question is why the management (at Oberkochen) took so
long in finding a concept,' says Mr Spath. Dr Jobst Herrmann, chairman of
the Carl Zeiss board, may partly have answered fears about the quality of
group management by resigning last week, though he is staying on in the job
until a replacement is found.
Over the next few days, unions and management from Oberkochen and Jena will
meet to decide if the restructuring plans can be implemented. But the
governments of Baden-Wurttemberg, Hesse (which has a Carl Zeiss subsidiary)
and Thuringia, are reluctant to accept more unemployment and may extend
financial aid to both plants.
'At the end of the day, Carl Zeiss, and its name, belongs in Jena,' says Mr
Domel. 'Jena's future depends on Carl Zeiss remaining here. Full stop.'
'I wonder if this marriage will even survive,' says Mr Theiracker. 'It
will,' says Mr Kramer. 'But it will need time to make it work.'

FT  01 NOV 94 / Bank says Italy may miss debt servicing target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of Italy yesterday warned that continued high interest rates risked
pushing the cost of servicing the country's huge debt stock well beyond the
figure envisaged in the 1995 budget.
The warning, issued in the bank's quarterly economic bulletin, is the most
authoritative statement so far suggesting a fundamental element in the
budget calculations may be faulted.
It comes at a time when the right-wing coalition government and the
opposition are struggling to hammer out a parliamentary agreement on the
budget. The budget is seeking to find L50,000bn (Pounds 20bn) in fresh
revenues and, through spending cuts, to hold down the deficit to L138,000bn
 -equivalent to 8 per cent of GDP.
The report also confirms the strength of the recovery now taking place in
the Italian economy and claims inflationary pressures exist. However, the
bank says these should have been checked by the half percentage point rise
in the discount rate in mid-August.
It is this interest rate rise, interrupting a steady fall since late October
1992, that has undermined the budget calculations. The report points out
that short-dated government bonds are now 2.1 percentage points above the 8
per cent ceiling targeted for the year-end, and due to be sustained
throughout 1995. Similar considerations apply to medium-term treasury paper.
According to the bank, a one percentage point increase in interest rates
over the next 12 months implies an extra debt service cost of L6,000bn,
rising to an additional L14,000bn in the third year. The budget forecasts
debt service payments in 1995 at L176,250bn.
In the light of the recent tensions between the Bank of Italy and the
government, over the appointment of a new director-general at the bank, the
report uses even more cautious language than usual. However, between the
lines the bank is telling the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi that the
budget may well have to be toughened.
'Only rigorous pursuit of the budget objectives - eventually toughened
because of exceeding the ceilings placed on interest payments - can reduce
the risks by altering the perceptions of the financial markets,' the report
comments.
The bank estimates that this year's inflation will be around 4 per cent
against the 3.5 per cent target, making the 2.5 per cent objective for 1995
harder to achieve. As domestic demand picks up, pushing GDP growth this year
to at least 2 per cent (against the 1.6 per cent expected), inflationary
pressures have begun to emerge. As a result, the bank has reaffirmed its
determination to keep a tight control of monetary policy.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Brittan to stay on in Brussels: Decision by disappointed Sir
Leon averts damaging row over Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan averted another damaging political row over Europe
yesterday by announcing his intention to stay on as the UK's senior
commissioner in Brussels.
At a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Sir Leon
said he was 'disappointed' he had lost responsibility for relations with
east and central Europe. But he said his diminished portfolio -
responsibility for multilateral trade and relations with developed countries
 -was an 'important' challenge.
He pledged to remain in Brussels to argue for a Europe that was 'open,
free-trading and non-interventionist, and for a Britain that is at the heart
of that Europe'.
Coincidentally, Sir Leon was attending a meeting between EU foreign
ministers and their counterparts from six countries seeking membership of
the Union - Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and
Romania.
He was speaking two days after he narrowly lost a battle to retain
responsibility for western Europe's former communist neighbours in the
carve-up of Commission portfolios announced by Mr Jacques Santer, the
incoming Commission president.
The task of organising the early admission of former communist countries to
the Union - a central plank of UK strategy towards the development of the EU
 -went to Mr Hans Van den Broek of the Netherlands.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said he was 'extremely glad' that
Sir Leon had chosen to stay in the Commission. He was clearly relieved that
Mr John Major's government would not have to contemplate disputes over a
successor.
'The portfolio Sir Leon has will continue to be essential and it is
therefore very good that this important job should continue to be in sound
and strong hands in the Commission,' Mr Hurd said.
Yesterday's meeting was the first in which eastern Europe was able to
influence debate on EU policy, putting views on topics from justice and home
affairs, to the environment, education and training.
Mr Laszlo Kovacs, the Hungarian foreign minister, said: 'This was a very
important meeting. For the first time we had the chance to have a certain
influence on discussions. It helped EU ministers to understand our
priorities and aspirations.'
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, reassured the east European
ministers that progress towards full Union membership was not moving too
slowly. 'What we require is a realistic and sober approach to bringing them
into the EU,' he said. 'Economic aid at the end of the day can only help the
countries to help themselves.'
Ministers discussed ideas for an accession strategy, in particular bringing
east European laws into line with those in the west to allow the six to
operate within the EU's single market.
Changes to the Phare aid programme, a main source of EU financial assistance
to the former communist countries, were also discussed. The six countries
want to see the limit on infrastructure spending lifted from 15 per cent of
the total budget.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Fayed steps up attack on Aitken: Hotel owner challenges
account of how Paris Ritz bill was paid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Aitken's explanation of circumstances surrounding the payment of
his hotel bill at the Paris Ritz was challenged yesterday by Mr Mohamed
Fayed, the hotel's owner.
As Mr Fayed stepped up his allegations against Mr Aitken, Treasury chief
secretary, The Guardian was facing a Commons inquiry into its handling of
disclosures about the bill.
Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, ordered an investigation into The
Guardian's admission that it used a doctored Commons letterhead to seek
details of Mr Aitken's bill. Amid rowdy Commons exchanges, The Guardian's
use of subterfuge was described as 'quite deplorable' by Mr John Prescott,
Labour's deputy leader.
Sir James Spicer, a Tory member of the powerful privileges committee, said
Mr Peter Preston, The Guardian's editor, should resign. More than 100 Tory
backbenchers signed a Commons motion calling for Mr Preston's conduct to be
referred to Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions.
Mr Preston defended the use of the letterhead, which he said was part of an
arrangement with Mr Fayed intended to allow the Ritz management to release
details of the bill. 'Of course in retrospect, even for this internal
communication, it would have been better to have used another heading on the
notepaper. But the purpose was to protect the source at the time - it was
not to deceive anybody,' he said.
Mr Fayed, the owner of Harrods, said he took 'full responsibility' for
assisting The Guardian 'in the public interest'. But he raised further
questions about the way in which part of the bill was paid initially by Mr
Said Ayas, a former business associate of Mr Aitken.
He also claimed that inquiries in Paris had shown that a brunette woman who
paid part of the bill in cash had also paid bills for other guests with a
cheque drawn on Mr Ayas's bank account. The identity of the woman has been a
central aspect of the mystery surrounding the bill. Mr Aitken told an
inquiry carried out by Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, that she was his
Swiss-born wife, Lolicia.
But Mr Fayed said the woman told the Ritz cashier in French: 'I have been
paying other bills at the George V and the Intercontinental. Here is the
cheque for Mr Ayas's account.'
He said that 'unless Mrs Aitken was also paying the other cheques to the
other hotels, the brunette in question was working on Mr Ayas's staff'.
Mr Fayed's spokesman, Mr Michael Cole, said there were inconsistencies
between the details of a cheque apparently written by Mr Aitken to clear up
a discrepancy over payment of his bill and the bank statement of the
recipient.
Pressure for a public hearing into cash for questions allegations against
two Conservative MPs increased as Sir Edward Heath, the former prime
minister, backed calls for the privileges committee to change its rules. Mr
David Alton, a Liberal Democrat member of the committee, said its inquiry
into Mr David Tredinnick and Mr Graham Riddick should be extended to include
other allegations of impropriety against ministers and MPs.
A Labour attempt to force the committee to sit in public was defeated by 301
votes to 264 in the Commons last night, leaving the committee to make its
own decision today. The seven Labour members decided last night to end a
boycott of the committee, suggesting they believe it will decide to sit at
least partly in public.

FT  01 NOV 94 / RJR to float 19% of Nabisco food business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RJR Nabisco, the US tobacco and food group, is to float 19 per cent of its
Nabisco food subsidiary.
It will also pay dividends for the first time since it was acquired in a
Dollars 25bn (Pounds 15.3bn) leveraged buyout by the Wall Street investment
house Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) in 1989.
But the group is to back out of an agreement to buy a 20 per cent stake in
Borden, the US food group, which is presently the target of a Dollars 2bn
bid from KKR.
RJR said it had been unable to reach agreement on accounting and other
issues, but would not give further details.
The flotation, clearing the way for demerger, will involve 45m shares of
Nabisco stock, priced at between Dollars 23 and Dollars 26 and carrying
dividends of 55c a year, to raise between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.2bn.
RJR said it will use the net proceeds to pay down bank debt. The sell-off
will value the whole of Nabisco, the biggest US biscuit maker which also
owns Planters nuts, LifeSavers confectionery and Fleischmann's margarine, at
Dollars 5.4bn to Dollars 6.2bn.
RJR said any eventual break-up would not be considered for at least two
years. Ownership of over 80 per cent of Nabisco is meanwhile required as a
condition for a tax-free spin-off.
KKR said it was 'completely committed' to the Borden bid, despite RJR's
decision, and was happy for Borden to continue being run by its existing
management. Borden has been among the least successful big US food companies
in recent years, and some management input from the more highly regarded
Nabisco had been envisaged as part of the deal.
KKR proposes to pay for the Borden purchase with RJR shares, halving its
stake in RJR, in which it is at present the dominant shareholder, to just
over 17 per cent. Wall Street analysts said RJR's refusal to become involved
with Borden could be seen as a show of independence.
An earlier demerger attempt by RJR, valuing Nabisco at Dollars 6.7bn,
collapsed last summer because it failed to protect Nabisco sufficiently from
the risk of litigation over tobacco.
In contrast to that plan, which left the tobacco company with title to
Nabisco's assets, the new version makes Nabisco wholly independent.
Although RJR's announcement was welcomed on Wall Street, the stock fell
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 6 1/8 .
Analysts attributed this to news that a state court judge in Florida had
given the go-ahead to a class action against cigarette makers by all smokers
who had become addicted to nicotine and had become ill as a result.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Pressure grows for partial sale of Post Office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is under pressure from senior ministers
to accept compromise proposals for Post Office commercialisation within the
public sector.
They hope to agree a plan in time for a bill to be included in the Queen's
speech on November 16 setting out the government's legislative programme for
the coming parliamentary session.
The cabinet's industry committee is expected to meet tomorrow to decide how
to give the Post Office greater freedom without risking defeat at the hands
of backbench Conservative rebels opposed to privatisation.
Ministers hope the cabinet will on Thursday be able to approve a partial
sale. But a decision may be put off until Thursday next week if the
committee fails to thrash out a compromise.
Mr John Major is understood to have told ministers that, if necessary, the
Post Office bill could be omitted from the Queen's speech and introduced
later in the session.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, remains committed to the
sale of 51 per cent of the Post Office, which he believes would send a
powerful signal of the government's continuing commitment to economic
reform.
But the government's business managers have warned ministers that
privatisation would be opposed by up to eight Tory backbenchers, implying
certain defeat for the bill unless some of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs
abstained.
Mr Heseltine will meet the rebels tonight in a final effort to persuade them
that fears for the future of rural post offices and the universal pricing
system have been overstated.
The compromise proposals focus on the sale of a minority shareholding
combined with freedom from government borrowing controls. Such a structure
would keep the Post Office in the public sector while satisfying management
demands for greater freedom to compete.
There is substantial support for a compromise among senior ministers, many
of whom doubt the wisdom of risking a parliamentary defeat in pursuit of
privatisation. However, the option of commercial freedom within the public
sector has been vigorously opposed by Mr Clarke on the grounds that
state-owned companies cannot be excluded from the public sector borrowing
requirement.
Other compromises being discussed include a phased sale of a majority
holding, which would give ministers time to convince backbenchers that
privatisation need not threaten rural services.
Rebel backbenchers said they would vote for a minority sale. 'My main
concern is to keep the Royal Mail in the public sector,' said Mr Stephen
Day, Conservative MP for Cheadle.

FT  01 NOV 94 / Inflation fears boost rate rise expectation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further signs of UK inflationary pressures increased speculation yesterday
that Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, will argue for a base
rate rise when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, tomorrow.
Expectations of a rate rise helped sterling climb against the dollar and the
D-Mark, with the pound reaching its highest level, on a trade-weighted
basis, since the beginning of March.
Two economic indicators published yesterday - the narrow measure of money
supply (M0) and the purchasing managers' index - led to increased concern
about inflation. M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 7.3 per cent in the 12
months to October, its fastest annual rate since January 1989, while a
survey of purchasing managers found 50.4 per cent paid higher prices for
their manufacturing purchases in October.
Developments in both measures have been cited by the Bank of England as
cause for concern. In the minutes of the September 7 meeting between Mr
George and Mr Clark, which decided to increase base rates from 5.25 to 5.75
per cent, Mr George cited the purchasing managers survey as an argument for
increasing rates. The prices component of the purchasing managers' index
rose in October.
M0's growth rate has stayed above the government's monitoring range of 0-4
per cent. In its August inflation report, the Bank of England noted that 'if
M0 growth remains at its present rate throughout the rest of the year,
concerns over future inflation would increase'. M0 growth has accelerated
from the 6.5 per cent level cited by that report.
However, Mr George has argued recently that bond markets are overestimating
the potential for a rise in inflation. 'There are relatively few immediate
signs that inflation is about to pick up strongly,' he said last week. The
bank's latest inflation report will be published today.

<TEXT>
The Japanese carmaker will announce half-year results on Friday. Although
the company is seeing firm sales in the US market with a 17.2 per cent rise
in unit sales in August, earnings have been hit by the poor performance in
the domestic market. Its domestic registrations fell 3 per cent in July in
spite of a 12 per cent rise in the overall market and industry analysts
expect Nissan's market share to fall further because of the lack of new
models. The company forecasts unconsolidated half-year sales to fall 3 per
cent to Y1,550bn (Dollars 16bn), and expects to post recurring losses of
Y60bn.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday: After the pick up in the UK money supply last month, the provisional
M0 figures for October are expected to show an expansion of 0.4 per cent
rise for the month, with a 7.2 per cent annual rise.
With last week's Confederation of British Industry manufacturing survey
showing strong exports and a rise in price expectations, the markets will
also be watching the Chartered Institute of Purchasing Managers' October
index for developments with a particular focus on new orders, which fell for
the third consecutive month in September.
Tuesday: In the US, the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index
is expected to be 58.7 per cent in October, slightly up from September's
index of 58.2 per cent. Such a figure usually indicates strong economic
growth.
Wednesday: Given the strong performance of the dollar in October, the UK's
official reserves are expected to increase by Pounds 15m in October.
Thursday: Morgan Grenfell says the National Association of Home Builders'
survey suggests weaker conditions for sales in September. It expects new
home sales to drop by 4 per cent.

MONDAY 31
Coal Authority takes over
The newly formed Coal Authority takes over ownership of the UK's coal
reserves and licensing functions from British Coal, which is being
privatised. The Mansfield-based authority's chairman is Sir David White,
chairman of Mansfield Brewery, and its chief executive is Neville
Washington, a former army colonel.
Sino-South Korean relations: Chinese premier Li Peng begins a five-day visit
to South Korea, where he will discuss Beijing's role in promoting improved
relations between North and South Korea. China is North Korea's closest
ally, but has also become a leading trading partner with South Korea. Li's
visit follows two trips by South Korean president Kim Young-sam to China.
EU expansion: European Union foreign ministers meet their counterparts from
Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania in
Luxembourg. The leaders will discuss setting up a dialogue to help
strengthen their relationship, ahead of eventual expansion of the EU. They
will also discuss the situation in Bosnia.
Women on top: The Women of the Year lunch takes place at London's Savoy
Hotel. About 500 women who have achieved outstanding success in their chosen
fields will attend. Special guests are the author of Wild Swans, Jung Chang,
and Diane Abbot MP.
Greens vs Suharto: Environmental groups take Indonesia's president Suharto
to court today, alleging that he diverted Dollars 185m (Pounds 117m) from a
reforestation project fund to help develop the state-run aircraft industry.
Ship safety: Norwegian proposals for ro-ro ship safety will be put before a
meeting of Nordic ship safety directors following the sinking of the Estonia
last month, in which 900 people died.
Norway is responsible for looking at the stability of existing ships, while
Sweden, Finland and Denmark are examining ferry evacuation, the design and
operation of bow doors and lifesaving equipment. Norway has said it may take
unilateral action over standards for Norwegian ro-ro ships, and foreign
ro-ro vessels trading to that country, if there is no international
agreement.
Taxing time: Today is the deadline for filing annual tax returns in the UK.
All taxpayers whose pay is not fully covered by PAYE, who pay tax at the
higher rate or who have received a tax form from the Inland Revenue risk
being charged interest on any outstanding amounts.
TUESDAY 1
New rules on unit trusts
The UK's Pounds 100bn unit trust industry makes further progress towards
deregulation with the coming into force of new rules liberalising charges
and the range of markets in which the trusts can invest. A further change
means newspapers no longer have to publish the 'cancellation' price - the
lowest price at which units can be bought back by the unit trust company.
UK economy: The underlying rate of inflation may last month have reached its
lowest level since records began in 1967, but other indicators such as the
producer prices index, the third-quarter GDP report and the latest CBI
survey, suggest inflationary pressures lie ahead. November's quarterly
bulletin and inflation report from the Bank of England, out today, will give
a view on future prospects.
Casablanca summit: On its last day, delegates at the Middle East/North
Africa Economic Summit in Casablanca are expected to approve a declaration
establishing a regional financial organisation and laying the foundations
for greater co-ordination between development assistance and investment
guarantee organisations. The summit may see the setting up of a Middle
East/North Africa economic community.
The gathering aims to provide economic foundations for a peaceful Middle
East after Israel's peace agreements with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation and Jordan.
Havel in Hungary: Czech president Vaclav Havel visits Budapest at the
invitation of his Hungarian counterpart, Arpad Goncz. Although Havel has
visited the country several times and is on good terms with Goncz, it is his
first official visit as leader.
Dairy industry: The UK's Milk Marketing Board is replaced by the Milk
Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative. The UK's 30,000 dairy farmers
will be able to sell their milk to whoever they like. Previously the MMB was
obliged to buy all of it. Industry analysts claim milk prices are set to
rise as a result.
Duty call: Air passenger duty, set out in the UK Budget last November, comes
into effect. It will add Pounds 5 to the cost of domestic and European
flights and Pounds 10 to those elsewhere.
Dennis Potter: A memorial service will be held for British novelist and
playwright Dennis Potter at 11am in St James's Church, Piccadilly, London.
Potter, the creator of television dramas such as The Singing Detective and
Lipstick On Your Collar, died in June.
Japanese heritage: A six-day world cultural heritage conference opens in
Nara.
FT Surveys: Greater Atlanta and Australia.
Holidays: All Saints Day (some European institutions closed).
WEDNESDAY 2
Iliescu seeks UK support
Romanian president Ion Iliescu starts a three-day visit to the UK, during
which he will meet prime minister John Major, trade and industry secretary
Michael Heseltine and foreign secretary Douglas Hurd. He hopes to boost
economic ties between the two countries. Major is also expected to raise the
case of Adrian and Bernadette Mooney, jailed for 28 months each earlier this
month for attempting to smuggle a baby out of Romania.
Inflationary pressure: Chancellor Kenneth Clarke and the governor of the
Bank of England, Eddie George, meet to discuss monetary policy. Markets are
ambivalent about the likely timing of future interest rate rises. When the
chancellor raised rates in September, he did not announce the decision until
the Monday after that month's meeting.
Swedish finances: Goran Persson, finance minister of the newly elected
Social Democrat government, presents tough plans to cut the country's budget
deficit, which is running at 13 per cent of GDP. Citing the need to
stabilise Sweden's debt by 1998, he is expected to go beyond the SKr61bn
(Pounds 5.3bn) of planned savings and tax increases his party outlined
before its September election victory.
Nuclear trafficking:
A meeting at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna will discuss
strategies to combat illegal trafficking of nuclear materials from the
former Soviet Union. After the discovery of several cases of plutonium
smuggling to Germany earlier this year, the agency has made the issue a
priority.
OECD in Bucharest: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development advisory group on investment holds its fourth plenary meeting in
Bucharest.
Turkish prime minister Tansu Ciller visits Israel at the start of a Middle
East trip that will include Gaza and Egypt, with the aim of furthering
bilateral ties. She is the first prime minister of Moslem Turkey to visit
Israel.
William Holman Hunt's 'The Shadow of Death', one of the best-known Victorian
images, shows Christ in his father's workshop stretching at the end of his
day's labour to give thanks to God. The setting sun casts a silhouette,
which the Virgin Mary sees as a premonition of the Crucifixion. Sotheby's in
London offers the quarter-size replica of the 7ft-high original, which Hunt
made for use by engravers. It is expected to fetch Pounds 900,000.
THURSDAY 3
Swan song on the Tyne
The Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond, the last of 2,700 vessels built by
134-year-old Swan Hunter, leaves the Tyne for Portsmouth, on its way to be
handed over to the Royal Navy next week. Richmond's departure from Swan's
Wallsend yard signals the company's closure and the probable end of
shipbuilding on the river. Swan has been in receivership since May 1993.
Embattled Russian prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin arrives in Warsaw for a
two-day visit to sign an agreement that will cancel mutual debts and open
the way for a 600km natural gas pipeline across Poland to Germany. The
pipeline is part of a longer 3,000km project designed to bring 63bn cu m a
year from the Jamal peninsula in Russia to western Europe.
Cinema scope: The 17-day London Film Festival opens. More than 200 films
from around the world will be shown, and the event includes premiers of
Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein starring Robert de Niro and Dennis Potter's
last film, Midnight Movie.
Plane facts: What is thought to be the world's first auction of commercial
aircraft takes place in Las Vegas. More than 40 civilian aircraft go under
the hammer at Bally's Casino.
FT Surveys: Turkish Finance and Industry, and UK Consumer Credit and Asset
Finance.
Holidays: Japan (Culture Day).
FRIDAY 4
South African delegation
South African foreign minister Alfred Nzo visits France. He will attend the
Franco-African summit in Biarritz as part of a delegation led by deputy
president Thabo Mbeki.
Light fantastic: Deepavali, or Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, is
celebrated by the Hindu community worldwide. The highlight of the event is
the lighting of thousands of lamps in homes to welcome the goddesses of
wealth and learning.
India has more reason to celebrate. The World Health Organisation gave it a
clean bill of health last week after the recent outbreak of plague. Overseas
visitors are expected to arrive in their thousands after more than 12
airlines which banned flights to the country during the scare resume
operations.
Non-farm payrolls: Bond markets will be trading nervously ahead of the US
non-farm payrolls for October, out today. The pace of payrolls' growth has
slowed to a monthly average of 260,000 new jobs in the third quarter,
compared with 340,000 in the second.
Canada's House of Commons breaks until November 14.
Saleroom: Christie's in London is holding a sale of Victorian works,
including Sir Edwin Landseer's 'The Deer Pass', which is expected to realise
up to Pounds 300,000, and William Holman Hunt's 'Bride of Bethlehem',
expected to fetch up to Pounds 400,000.
WEEKEND 5-6
Canada team in China
Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, leads a delegation of nearly 400
business leaders, politicians and officials to Beijing on Sunday. Canadian
exports to China, totalling CDollars 1.7bn (Pounds 770m) in 1993, have
stagnated in recent years. But imports have risen rapidly, reaching CPounds
3.1bn last year.
Old masters: More than 450 cars will take part in the 98th London to
Brighton Veteran Car Rally on Saturday. Only about 300 are expected to
finish: with a top speed of 8mph, it is feared some vehicles will be unable
to beat the 4pm deadline.
Business leaders meet: The Confederation of British Industry annual
conference begins on Sunday in Birmingham.
Motor racing: The Japanese Grand Prix takes place on Sunday at Suzuka.
Visiting Down Under: Qiao Shi, chairman of China's National People's
Congress, visits Sydney on Sunday.
Ask the people: Albania holds a referendum on a new constitution on Sunday.
Asian politics: Tajikstan holds presidential elections and a referendum on a
new constitution.

The long-awaited Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong's new airport is
expected to come through early this week, with potential to stir the market,
writes Louise Lucas.
Airport-related stocks ticked upwards at the end of last week but many
analysts reckon the agreement has already been discounted in share prices,
and that the actual signing will do little to overturn jaded sentiment.
A sprinkling of corporate results, beginning with the half-year figures from
Hongkong Telecom on Tuesday, could spark a wave of selective buying. The
telecoms stock has seen its price surge already on the back of the HKDollars
2bn investment in China announced earlier this month.
Fears of interest rate rises continue to spook the market and keep investors
sidelined. While a 0.5 per cent rise in the US next month has largely been
factored in, fears remain of a further increase before the year-end.

With the Japan Tobacco listing and oversupply worries out of the way,
investors will focus on corporate results and currency movements this week,
writes Emiko Terazono.
Interim results so far have proved better than expected for many
export-orientated companies, due to demand from the US and Asia.
However, profit announcements have failed to move share prices. Life
insurers, the leading institutional investors, are still cautious, interest
among overseas investors is waning and many analysts believe that public
funds remain the only source of buying. While underlying support of the
Nikkei around 19,000 is firm, share prices are unlikely to see aggressive
buying this week.

Depressed by the under-performance of UBS shares during its board's power
struggle with Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision, the bourse has the opportunity to
look elsewhere in the financial sector this Thursday. Winterthur, the
insurance group, is due to produce half-year figures and report on prospects
for the rest of 1994.

The Dutch market also hosts quarterly figures, both on Thursday, from KLM
and Philips. In August, KLM posted a strong increase in net profit in the
first quarter of 1994-95, reflecting good demand for air travel sparked by
general economic recovery as well as the company's cost-cutting efforts. In
the same month, Philips more than trebled its profits in the second quarter
of 1994, beating even the most optimistic of analysts' forecasts for the
electronics group.
UBS reckons that all of the Dutch majors, including DSM and Akzo, could
produce positive surprises this week, and says that Philips looks
undervalued on discounts of more than 25 per cent for 1995 and 1996.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Chemicals - Other markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Following ICI's third-quarter figures, which drew a dull response from the
London stock market last Thursday, three continental European majors produce
their progress reports this week.
DSM, which built its business on the ruins of the Dutch coal mining
industry, is like ICI in that it is highly involved in the commodity
chemical part of the business and will benefit most from a strong recovery
in prices for a number of petrochemical and plastics products since August,
says Hoare Govett.
The broker expects DSM's sales to rise to Fl 2.3bn from Fl 1.9bn, compared
with the third quarter of 1993, and pre-tax profits to come out at Fl 138m
against a corresponding loss of Fl 79m. It says that prospects for the last
quarter are even better, as in this period the third-quarter price increases
will be reflected fully in the results.
Goldman Sachs, too, has produced a sector preview in which it says that Akzo
Nobel, which combined its Dutch and Swedish components last year, should
bring net third-quarter earnings of around Fl 330m into its figures on
Wednesday, up from Fl 247m the year before, the rate of increase easing from
48 per cent in the second quarter to over 30 per cent in the third. Goldman
says that investors will be looking for any evidence of pressure on margins
from cost increases further upstream.
Both brokers expect Rhone-Poulenc, due on Thursday, to show figures which
bring it out of loss for the first time this year. Hoare Govett reckons that
an increase in operating margins from 6.8 per cent in the third quarter of
1993 to close on 10 per cent should produce net attributable profits of some
FFr465m, against a loss of FFr300m in the year-earlier period.
Meanwhile, Goldman expects moderate out-performance from the French stock,
saying that its apparently poor earnings performance in the first half of
1994 reflected erratic non-operating items; and that at operating level, and
excluding exceptional items, Rhone-Poulenc's experience should have been in
line with its peers.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Shares look vulnerable to change in tack -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volatility has become more than a keyword for describing the mood on the UK
stock market. Daily swings in share prices have reached proportions where
they not only reflect underlying factors but also influence prospects for
the market's performance over the final quarter of the year.
Last week, the FT-SE 100 Share Index moved through a range of around 80
points in terms of intra-day highs and lows, before closing on Friday with a
54 point gain on the week. Since many market strategists would probably
settle, at least privately, for a year-end Footsie anywhere above 3,300,
moves of 80 points are not to be brushed aside just because they have not
proved sustainable.
Volatility is related directly to the dismal volume of business in the UK
equity market. Equity bargains are running at around 25,000 daily, comparing
either with Christmas holiday sessions or, more ominously, with early July
this year when the Footsie was hitting its 1994 low.
Daily bargains are only around two-thirds of the average for the past two
years, so the rumours regularly sweeping the trading rooms that leading
houses are poised for wide-ranging staff cuts or even withdrawals from
market sectors are hardly surprising.
Low volume is hitting the market in two ways. Market-makers concentrate on
keeping trading books on a tight rein, and are unwilling to hold positions;
and at the first sign of a change in sentiment, stock flies round the market
and prices move sharply.
Such volatility makes programme trading, once every market trader's dream,
extremely hazardous. The securities house taking on a programme must
effectively buy the portfolio on offer and then turn to the market to unwind
its position. It takes the risk that at least some stocks may prove
difficult to unload.
The past few months have seen a number of large houses, including at least
one US investment bank, badly caught out and sustaining heavy losses when
the market suddenly dropped before a programme could be unwound.
Misfortunes for market-makers and securities houses are not necessarily
negative for the market or for share prices, except in an immediate sense.
Kleinwort Benson points out this week that institutional activity is light
and that this leaves share prices highly vulnerable to any turn to the
bullish tack.
Unfortunately, as some observers admit, events in the US have revived the
prospect that UK base rates may have to go up before the end of the year,
rather than in the new year when such a development would apparently be
acceptable in the market.
This effectively leaves London dependent on the US and German bond markets.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Report on BT reveals the secret of global
success - International issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's not often that the tactical decisions made during a tricky global share
offering are made public. So a report from the National Audit Office
offering a bird's eye view of what made the UK Treasury's sale last summer
of its third and final stake in British Telecommunications 'a success' is
required reading indeed.
Between the date the sale was announced in November 1992 and the date the
shares were priced in July 1993, existing BT shares held their market value
relative to the FT-SE index. The shares were sold at no discount to the
market price, earning the Treasury almost exactly the Pounds 3.8bn it had
hoped to make.
The report might make instructive reading for Japan's Ministry of Finance,
which is considering how it ought to organise future privatisations
following the poor reception given its partial privatisation of Japan
Tobacco last week.
Broadly speaking, global book-building, pioneered in the US, requires
sustained marketing by a selling syndicate before any shares are priced at
all. During the book-building process, bids are received for shares and the
price and actual allocations are set with respect to visible market demand.
Because the ultimate proceeds to the seller are dependent upon the trading
price for existing shares immediately before pricing, global book-building
exercises can be vulnerable if shareholders or others engage in
short-selling or in outright share sales.
It was this point which made the UK government's BT3 sale so controversial
and almost from the start, SG Warburg, global co-ordinator for the deal, was
embroiled in controversy.
In the weeks leading up to the sale of 1.31bn shares in BT in July 1993,
there were charges and counter-charges of attempts to manipulate the BT
share price, both by institutional investors and Warburg.
In that environment, the fact that the sale raised Pounds 3.79bn for the
Treasury while most institutional investors surveyed viewed the sale as a
success, is an achievement.
The NAO report, issued last week, lists three key factors contributing to
this success.
First, the Treasury and its advisers, Warburg, kept the markets in the dark
about exactly how many shares were going to be offered to international
investors. They were told the amount they could buy would depend on the
level of domestic demand.
Second, the sales and commission structure was such that the firm which
worked the hardest to sell the shares could receive the commission, even if
ultimately the bid to buy shares was booked through another firm. The NAO
study shows that while 57 per cent of allocations to institutions were
booked through Warburg, it only earned 36 per cent of the sales commission.
Third, the Treasury and Warburg went to great lengths to ensure that those
who had sold BT shares before the offering would be denied the opportunity
to buy new ones.
It was this final effort which caused such friction between UK institutional
investors and Warburg. The NAO report contains the startling admission that
the Treasury went so far as to discuss asking the financial regulators to
give it information about who was selling BT shares so it could deny them
allocations from the offering. After hearing from its own lawyers that this
was clearly illegal, the Treasury considered other methods.
In the end, the Treasury and Warburg had to content themselves with an
undertaking by the Stock Exchange to monitor large transactions in BT shares
in the run-up to pricing. The rancour among institutional investors showed,
although the report suggests this may have actually deterred some sales.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Wall Street looks beyond next rate rise -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the next rate increase all but assured, Wall Street is beginning to
calculate how much more the Federal Reserve will have to tighten credit
conditions to bring growth down to a manageable pace.
On Friday, the Commerce Department announced that the economy had expanded
at an annual rate of 3.4 per cent in the third quarter, much higher than the
most recent estimates.
Over the past week, economists had lifted their forecasts to around 3.0 per
cent in response to the recent series of robust indicators. While the
reported figure represents a slowdown from the second quarter, when the
economy accelerated at a 4.1 per cent rate, the Fed is not likely to be
satisfied.
Thus, the data merely closed one chapter and opened another. 'It's a
foregone conclusion that the Fed is going to raise rates a half point at its
next meeting on November 15. The real issue now is whether the Fed is going
to raise rates again afterwards,' says Mr Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany in New York, 'That makes for a very uneasy, restive
kind of environment,' he says.
But if there is a sense of uncertainty dominating the equity markets, it was
surely not apparent immediately after the GDP announcement. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average jumped more than 55 points, to close the week at
3,930.66.
The positive movement was partly explained by the hammering blue chips had
taken in five of the previous six sessions. The rebound came after a steady
stream of strong earnings news which had flooded into Wall Street over the
past fortnight. As of last week, 20 per cent of companies had reported
profits 10 per cent or more above the consensus, according to SG Warburg.
Most importantly, bonds were surprisingly co-operative, with the yield on
the benchmark 30-year issue dipping below 8.00 per cent, a level viewed as a
psychological obstacle for stocks. On Friday, fixed-rate investors took
solace in a third-quarter dip in the implicit price deflator, a keenly
watched measure of inflation, and suggestions that the headline GDP figure
was boosted by inventory accumulation.
As a consequence, Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities,
says the Fed would have difficulty justifying a rate increase after its
expected move around November 15.
Investors are already looking for further evidence to support such a
conclusion. They will not have long to wait because this week brings two of
the most crucial pieces of economic data in the monthly release cycle.
The National Association of Purchasing Management will publish its October
survey of business activity tomorrow, while the Labor Department's report on
employment conditions is due on Friday.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Market waits for US employment data -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign exchanges will be focusing on the US and UK central banks this week,
with the possibility that interest rates may rise in both countries.
Inflationary pressures are an issue on either side of the Atlantic, though
the problem, at least from the point of view of financial markets, is much
more pressing in the US.
Sterling has recently been stronger, following a rate rise last month, while
the market believes that nothing short of a large rise in US rates can
rescue the dollar from its current plight.
The dollar is likely to trade in a fairly narrow range this week, ahead of
Friday's release of the October employment report. The third quarter GDP
figure, released last Friday, and showing output up by 3.4 per cent, did not
dispel the market's inflation concerns. Traders will thus shift their
attention to the labour market for signs of inflation.
In recent months, dollar weakness has been closely tied up with investor
fears that the US Federal Reserve has been too slow in combating inflation.
The market consensus is that a turn-round in the dollar's trend is unlikely
until the Fed's monetary tightening process appears complete.
In the short term, however, there is some evidence that the dollar may have
bottomed. Mr Brian Marber, chartist, said there had been a weekly reversal
in the dollar's price movement. Accordingly, though he stood by his
prediction of a longer term fall to DM1.3910, he thought the dollar could
stabilise at current levels for a number of weeks.
Higher UK rates are less likely in the short term, though some economists,
such as Morgan Grenfell, believe that a 25 basis point rise in rates will be
authorised at Wednesday's monthly monetary meeting. Their argument is based
on above trend economic growth, and the CBI's October survey showing strong
price and cost pressures.
Against this is the fact that Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of
England, has recently gone to some lengths to stress that he feels the
market's fears about inflation are exaggerated. Last week he said that there
were 'relatively few signs that inflation is about to pick up strongly.'
A rise in rates against this backdrop would be surprising. Even without a
rate rise, most analysts believe sterling to be well supported at current
levels.
In Europe, the Nordic currencies are likely to continue trading actively in
the run-up to the Swedish referendum, on November 13, on joining the
European Union. The Swedish krona and the Finnish markka have both recently
been strong.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MIDDLE EAST
Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets has launched the first regional Middle
East closed-end fund on the New York stock exchange. In a global placing it
has so far raised Dollars 42m.
The fund, which is FCEM's first US listed fund, is investing 65 per cent in
securities of Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan and Oman. Because of US
legislation it will never invest in Iran, Iraq or Libya.
SURVEY
China remains the highest priority among international companies wishing to
make an investment in an emerging economy, according to a survey of 100
companies conducted by Ernst &amp; Young.
After China, India and Indonesia attract attention, while the most important
factor in attracting inward investment was that of political stability.
The survey sought to identify the investment intentions of 1,000
multinational companies and to explore the decision making process that
accompanied such expansion.
INDIA
India's recently-launched National Stock Exchange (NSE) plans to start
screen-based equities trading next month.
The NSE will initially trade in 200 shares from November 3. But plans to
expand to 500 shares in the next six months are expected to eat into the
business of the Bombay stock exchange, which accounts for 75 per cent of
turnover of all the stock exchanges.
The BSE has a market capitalisation of Dollars 130bn from over 6,000 listed
companies.
The BSE is switching from open outcry trading to a screen-based system from
January 1995.
The BSE officials have also announced plans to introduce options and futures
once the entire trading is screen-based and settlement procedures improved.
The NSE was conceived in 1990, mainly out of frustration with brokers'
refusal to accept any change in antiquated trading practices.
RUSSIA
The Moscow Commodity Exchange, one of the main dollar futures trading
centres in Russia, is to launch a western-style stock market before the end
of the year.
Dozens of stock exchanges have been set up in Russia, but only a few trade
securities, and their trading volumes are very small.
The bulk of the market is in the hands of brokers trading over the counter.
Several of these brokers have set up an electronic quote system and are
working on developing a share trading system linked to a depositary.
POLAND
The Warsaw stock exchange has approved for listing shares in Remak, an
engineering company, and Debica, the tyre maker, as well as four new issues
of listed companies.
Remak and Debica were floated earlier this year, while the four quoted
companies - BIG, Elektrim, Mostostal Warszawa and Zywiec - won listing for
new shares issued in February and March this year.
BUDAPEST
The Budapest stock exchange will introduce an official share index on
January 1 1995. Since the opening of the bourse on June 21 1990, the index
has been used as an unofficial weighted index, which currently reflects the
price movements of 13 of the BSE's 39 shares.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Global funds gap 'widening'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gap between the best and worst performing global emerging markets funds
is growing wider, according to a review by Fund Research. The report found
that the best global emerging markets fund increased by 67.2 per cent, while
the worst rose by only 6.2 per cent over the 12 months to August 1.
Mr Peter Jeffreys, managing director of Fund Research, an independent
research company on international open-end and closed-end funds, said the
review also identified a widening gap between fund management groups in
terms of the quantity and quality of resources dedicated to emerging
markets.
The report covered 50 of the sector's 120 funds, drawn from a group of US,
UK and offshore open and closed end funds.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Africa's stock markets aim high - The
Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As with so much else on the continent, Africa's stock exchanges tend to be
bypassed by international investors who are convinced that anything preceded
by the word African must be a hopeless economic basket case.
Indeed, even among emerging markets specialists, few are aware of the
existence of any African stock markets outside of South Africa - and even in
that country genuine international interest is a relatively recent
occurrence.
Last week, however, at the annual general meeting of the African Stock
Exchanges Association (ASEA) in Johannesburg, representatives from bourses
across the region served notice that Africa is determined to put itself back
on the international investment map.
In particular, now that a politically rehabilitated South Africa is rapidly
becoming integrated with the rest of the continent and is poised to act as
its economic leader, hopes are running high that the continent's various
exchanges are about to embark on an unprecedented growth path.
'The situation is looking better now for Africa than at any time in the past
30 years, and there's real potential for growth,' observes one analyst who
recently started assessing African stocks.
While such glib predictions litter Africa's modern economic history, ASEA
officials are adamant that this is no longer a pipe-dream, pointing out that
there are currently no fewer than 14 operative African stock markets, with a
combined market capitalisation of Dollars 256bn (Pounds 162bn).
Of these, South Africa is by far the most important player, accounting for
Dollars 240bn compared with Dollars 7bn in North Africa (Egypt, Tunisia and
Morocco); Dollars 8bn in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Nigeria,
Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Swaziland and Uganda) and a
further Dollars 1bn coming from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius.
Even more striking is the fact that many exchanges already offer impressive
returns. As a group the African markets rose by an average 30 per cent last
year and only two exchanges, Botswana and Nigeria, fell. Zimbabwe,
meanwhile, had the fourth best performing market in the world, rising by an
astonishing 123 per cent in dollar terms (albeit off a low base) and the
Mauritian index rose 51 per cent.
Taking note of these figures, some of the bigger investment banks and
securities houses have started to investigate African markets more
seriously. Morgan Stanley, for example, has included several non-South
African stocks in its Africa Fund and is distinctly upbeat on the
continent's prospects.
'In spite of past problems, Africa's potential is unmistakeable. The world's
second largest continent, with 11m square miles, is three times the size of
the US and has twice the population, 600m strong, and is rich in natural
resources and agriculture,' its assessment concludes.
Similarly, in another recent report, Barings predicts that African exchanges
should be able to expand from their current 2.2 per cent share of world
market capitalisation to 3 per cent by 2010 on the back of anticipated
cross-border equity flows of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.6bn. The
sub-Saharan markets on their own, the report predicts, could expand by a
factor of five or six times.
Nevertheless, if the continent is to achieve this, analysts agree that
further structural reforms are desperately needed. In particular, the
markets need to boost liquidity substantially: South Africa, with annual
turnover amounting to only 7.4 per cent of market capitalisation, is
currently the most liquid of all sub-Saharan markets and even in the north,
only Morocco's 21.7 per cent exceeds it.
In large part, this is due to currency controls, which are still in place in
nearly all African countries and need to be removed to allow the free
movement of capital. At the same time, however, the markets need to launch
some international stock offerings to help raise the continent's profile.
These points are largely accepted by the markets, which have started
actively lobbying their respective governments for action on both fronts.
'Only by removing the major stumbling block of exchange controls and by
providing new shares through privatisation issues can we attract the foreign
capital we so dearly need to develop our countries,' observes Mr Jimnah
Mbaru, ASEA chairman.
The first leg of this process has already begun. Several countries have
implemented currency reforms as part of IMF-imposed structural adjustment
programmes. South Africa is also likely to jettison its own confusing
financial rand system for foreign investors some time early next year, which
should provide further impetus for the deregulation process.
At the same time, moreover, many states are considering privatising
companies in sectors such as mining, telecommunications and transport. As
Ghana's highly successful recent Dollars 450m flotation of its Ashanti gold
mine, of which 87 per cent was sold internationally, indicates, given the
proper conditions global investors are more than willing to take a chance on
Africa.
In the meantime, the continent's stockbroking fraternity is continuing to
grow: two more markets, in Tanzania and Malawi, are expected to open over
the coming year.

FT  31 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Securum marks a Swedish milestone -
International loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The SKr20bn refinancing package announced last week by Securum, the
state-owned Swedish company set up to liquidate the failed loans of
Nordbanken, was big by any standards. From a company less than two years
old, it was spectacular.
The operation is a milestone in Sweden's progress out of the crisis that
overwhelmed its banking sector in 1992. Significant state intervention was
required to restore confidence.
'Securum has been the main symbol of the Swedish banking crisis,' says Mr
Anders Nyren, the group's chief financial officer. 'For the company to be
able to refinance itself in the international markets so soon after it was
set up shows the progress which has been made.'
Securum was established in early 1993 after taking on SKr60bn in failed
loans from Nordbanken, which collapsed into state arms in 1992 as the
biggest casualty of Sweden's banking crisis. It has converted bad credits
into some SKr44bn worth of assets, which it intends to sell off gradually
over the next 10 years to maximise returns to the taxpayer.
It has changed from being a finance company to an investment, industrial and
real estate holding company. The transformation was the starting point for
the refinancing which will allow it to pay back most of the loans it has
received from Nordbanken.
The package involves an international and a domestic tranche. Under the
international tranche, Chemical Bank and Enskilda Corporate will arrange a
Dollars 1.4bn amortising five-year syndicated term loan. Pricing is Libor
plus 25 basis points. After a two-year grace period, the company expects to
pay down about half of the loan over the following three years. At the end
of the period, the remaining portion will either be refinanced or paid back
using proceeds from asset disposals.
The domestic portion falls into two parts, a SKr5bn subordinated term loan
and a SKr5bn callable subordinated private placement, both running over 10
years. The arranging banks, Enskilda Corporate and Nordbanken, are expected
to provide most of the term loan themselves. Terms are Stibor (Stockholm
inter-bank offered rate) plus 'a few basis points' (in practice, less than
five).
The private placement comprises a five-year fixed interest rate bond. If
market conditions move against the company before the rate is set in a few
weeks time, it has a back-up facility to draw down funds on a Stibor basis.
After five years, the bond rate will be re-set.
The domestic/international structure reflects Securum's balance sheet with
its 60/40 per cent asset split between Sweden and abroad. For the
international tranche, a syndicated loan was preferred to a bond issue
because Securum does not have a credit rating and a bond was considered less
flexible.
A crucial element in the total package is the backing provided by the
Swedish state. The SKr10bn domestic portion of the deal will be formally
guaranteed by the Kingdom of Sweden, which is transferring a pledge that
underpins Securum's existing Nordbanken loan.
The international tranche is covered by the blanket support measures which
the government introduced in late 1992 to retain confidence in the banking
sector.
The state role undoubtedly helped Securum obtain competitive terms, although
not to the extent that it was considered sovereign risk. The terms also
reflect Securum's better than expected financial performance in the first 18
months of its life and the situation in the Swedish market, where the banks
are flush with cash following recapitalisation and weak loan demand.
Indeed, Securum believes the terms it secured in the domestic market are at
least as favourable as if it had stuck with Nordbanken, even though
Nordbanken has provided its loan on a cost-of-funds basis.
Combining the term loan and the private placement elements, Securum expects
to end up with a basic interest rate of a few basis points below Stibor. On
a worst-case scenario, it expects the rate to work out at Stibor plus one
and half basis points.
If the international tranche is included in the calculation, the company
expects its overall funding costs to be 'very marginally' higher than they
are today.
Initial market reactions to the package were positive. 'It's priced
according to the market and it's well structured,' said one Swedish banking
source, who believed it would be successful because it gives international
banks, excluded from some recent relationship-driven deals, the opportunity
to get into the Swedish market.
The deal is strategically important for Securum in several ways: it provides
visibility, it broadens its borrowing base and it allows it to build up
contacts with a range of international lenders. It should also assist the
government's plans to privatise Nordbanken - a move expected sometime next
year - by reducing the bank's uncomfortably large exposure to a single
client.

FT  31 OCT 94 / World Bond Marekts: Moody's move puts spotlight on Sweden -
Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Moody's Investors Service to place Sweden's Aa2 foreign
currency debt rating on review for a possible downgrading is likely to weigh
heavily on the bond market when it opens today.
After rallying sharply last week, the rating agency's move, prompted by its
concerns over the country's public-sector deficit, will force investors to
focus once again on Sweden's debt situation, which has troubled the market
most of the year, causing an exodus of foreign participants and the
withdrawal of leading Swedish investors.
After posting sharp gains during the 1993 bond market boom, Swedish bonds
have suffered particularly this year, not only from the bear market that has
depressed fixed-income markets worldwide, but also from problems at home: a
growing budget deficit and political jitters surrounding general elections.
Swedish bonds have been further dogged by inflationary fears and the spectre
of monetary tightening after the Riksbank raised interest rates on August 11
 -the first European rate increase in the current cycle.
Last week, however, Sweden's bond market was the strongest performer
worldwide; according to Salomon Brothers' world government bond index,
Swedish government bonds returned 1.41 per cent in the week to Thursday,
compared with a 0.35 per cent drop in the European bond index. Their yield
spread over German bunds narrowed sharply to around 320 basis points on
Friday from 357 points a week earlier.
Bond prices were propelled higher last week by a range of factors: Monday's
bullish bond auction result (with each tranche snapped up by a single
buyer), currency strength, and increasing hopes that Sweden will vote in
favour of joining the European Union in its referendum on November 13.
The Riksbank's 20-basis-point hike in the repo rate to 7.40 per cent on
Thursday further underpinned bonds because it was seen to boost the central
bank's inflation-fighting credibility.
Lastly, prices were boosted by calls from Mr Goran Persson, the finance
minister, for larger than forecast government spending cuts: in addition to
the SKr61bn of budget savings promised by the Social Democrats during the
election campaign, he proposed further spending cuts of 20 per cent over the
next four years.
However, the Moody's rating review highlights the risks still surrounding
Swedish bonds in the shape of the continuing accumulation of public-sector
debt.
'Stronger economic growth, lower unemployment and additional fiscal
restraint expected from the recently elected government suggest that budget
deficits relative to GDP will shrink; nevertheless the build-up in
public-sector debt will continue,' the agency warned.
'Moody's review will focus on the degree to which policies can be forged
over the medium term to strengthen the public sector finances and improve
the investment climate,' it stated.
Some market participants were surprised by the timing of the announcement.
'I think Moody's may have acted a bit prematurely here, especially
considering that the government hasn't yet presented the details of its
economic plans and with the EU referendum coming up,' said Mr James McKay,
international economist at Kidder Peabody.
On the other hand, he said, Moody's announcement could be welcomed as a
warning shot to the government, forcing it to place fiscal discipline at the
top of its agenda. Mr Persson is due to unveil details of his fiscal plan on
Wednesday.
The EU referendum remains another significant risk. In spite of Finland's
recent vote in favour of EU membership, the Swedish yea-sayers have held
only a slim majority in recent opinion polls, amid a large pool of undecided
voters. 'If the Swedes vote 'no', that could undermine the Social Democratic
leadership,' warns one analyst, who says a 'no' vote could cause the Swedish
yield spread over bunds to balloon back to more than 400 basis points.
Even before the Moody's announcement, Mr Graham McDevitt, strategist at
Paribas Capital Markets, was recommending switching out of Sweden ahead of
the EU referendum. One strategy would be to move into Danish bonds, while
more adventurous investors should consider a switch into Norway, which faces
an EU referendum on November 28, he says.
According to Mr McDevitt, Swedish bonds are moving to put bias on a 'yes'
decision while Norwegian bonds have 70 per cent discounted a 'no' vote. 'If
Sweden does vote for EU, Swedish bonds should rally but Norwegian bonds
should out-perform on hopes that a 'yes' result may now be possible in
Norway,' he says.
'If Sweden votes 'no', Swedish bonds would succumb to significant
profit-taking from long positions built up over the past month; this would
drag on Norwegian bonds, but better underlying fundamentals should limit the
decline,' he adds.

In the current German interest rate hiatus, with the Bundesbank waiting to
see what happens on the monetary, economic and political fronts, the eyes of
the bond market are fixed on the US.
Although Friday's US data proved positive for the financial markets, concern
over the timing and impact of the next US interest rate rise remains to the
fore.
The main domestic news last week was the easing of west German inflation to
2.8 per cent, bringing it closer to the central bank's 2 per cent goal, and
the recommendation by the main economic research institutes that interest
rates should not be cut significantly. This came in a broadly positive
report on the economy, which has been expanding with a vigour even the
Bundesbank admits has come as a surprise.
This makes it even more determined to rein back money supply growth to a
rate more consistent with low inflation. Until M3 slows down more sharply,
those who believe there is no more scope for the Bundesbank to cut interest
rates in the current cycle will be strengthened in their views.
Even so, some voices still argue that another cut in the discount and
Lombard rates, which have been static since May, is probable. For the bond
market, though, it is the US that will mainly determine whether yields
continue moving up.

The central event of the week for the gilts market will be Wednesday's
monthly meeting between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer,
and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
Some analysts think the meeting will lead to a further rise in base rates.
'The evidence of continued price pressures, falling capacity and no clear
slowdown in growth will be sufficient to prompt the governor to request a
further tightening of policy,' believes Mr James Barty, senior UK economist
at Morgan Grenfell. He predicts the meeting will result in base rates rising
to 6 per cent, a quarter of a percentage point increase.
But Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, thinks the
chancellor will resist a rate rise. He believes Mr Clarke will not want to
dent consumer confidence ahead of the vital Christmas shopping season, nor
will he want to antagonise voters before what is likely to be a fairly
austere Budget.
Either way, the market is likely to be jittery all week, especially as
September's base rate rise was delayed until the Monday after the monthly
meeting. The Bank's quarterly inflationary report, published on Tuesday, may
give some clues as to the governor's thinking; his recent remarks have
suggested bond markets are over-stating the inflationary threat.

Investors are expected to focus on the short-term money markets, which will
be affected by seasonal and technical factors this week.
A substantial rise in fund demand from banks, due to month-end funding,
corporate tax payments and the public holiday on Thursday, is likely to put
upward pressure on short-term rates.
The banks are also expected to increase fund procurement for the year-end,
pushing up two-month interest rates.
Over the past few weeks, the Bank of Japan has allowed short-term rates to
rise moderately in the face of increasing evidence of a gradual economic
recovery.
Although it has been forced to adopt an easier stance because of the yen's
appreciation against the dollar, economists expect it to allow a further
rise in short-term rates because of the underlying economic trends.
'We expect the BoJ to allow a gradual widening of the spread between the
overnight call rate and the ODR,' says DKB International.
Meanwhile, oversupply worries are adding to investor cautiousness as
corporate borrowing on the straight bond markets seems set to increase. Last
week Tokyo Electric Power, the leading electric utility company, said it
would issue Y100bn of straight bonds in November and corporations are also
expected to turn to the Eurobond markets for funds.

Last Friday's rally, which sent the 30-year yield back below 8 per cent, may
not carry through into this week. Analysts expect that for the next month or
so a weak dollar, renewed upward pressure on commodity prices, and another
tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve will steadily push bond
yields up towards 8.25 per cent or 8.5 per cent.
Yields, in fact, may go above 8 per cent this week, which is packed with the
sort of data that could unnerve investors if they contain hints of resurgent
inflation or unexpectedly strong economic growth.
The October employment report, due on Friday, will be the highlight.
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analysts forecast that non-farm payrolls will
have risen by 230,000 in October. Growth above 270,000 could send bonds
tumbling.
The market will also have to absorb the National Association of Purchasing
Management's index for October, and September personal income, manufacturers
orders, leading economic indicators and single family home sales.
If any of these figures are stronger than expected, the bond yield will
probably breach 8 per cent again. The consensus is that the Fed will tighten
policy on November 15, when its open market committee meets, by raising the
Fed funds rate target by 50 basis points to 5.25 per cent.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Markets: Risks of the Southern Comfort zone - Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The average central banker has been programmed to warn about the threat of
inflation regardless of economic circumstance. Something is clearly up,
then, when a well-known anti-inflationary hawk like Mr Eddie George,
Governor of the Bank of England, argues that the markets are too pessimistic
about the inflationary prospect.
Cynics may conclude that the need to talk his bond book is temporarily
taking precedence over Mr George's disinflationary zeal. Current high real
rates of interest are prohibitive for government borrowers everywhere. So
who is right: the governor or the markets? And why are bond markets suddenly
making central bankers look like monetary doves?
In the end the question turns on the nature of default risk. The markets are
saying that current levels of government debt are unlikely to be serviced in
full, especially in what economist David Roche of Independent Strategy likes
to call the Southern Comfort countries - a category in which he includes
Sweden and Finland, and on occasion the UK, along with Italy, Spain, Greece
and Portugal (see accompanying rake's progress-type chart).
Others whose debt-to-GDP ratios would qualify them for club membership
include Canada and Belgium.
The dismal calculus of debt is that real rates of interest are not only much
higher than potential GDP growth rates in these countries; the gap is now so
wide that it is difficult even for countries with strong governments to run
a primary budget surplus (excluding interest) big enough to stop the debt
increasing.
Yet the markets clearly do not expect a formal default. Most of the Southern
Comfort countries with substantial foreign currency denominated debts enjoy
much lower rates of interest on the foreign component of the debt stock than
on their domestic IOUs. It follows that investors are demanding an increased
risk premium against the possibility of an internal default, whereby
governments monetise debt by borrowing from the domestic banking system -
the modern equivalent of printing money.
Whether the markets are right to assume that the foreign debt will still be
serviced is another matter. The consequence of internal default through
inflation is likely to be an overvalued real exchange rate, followed by a
devaluation that will increase the real cost in domestic currency of
servicing the foreign investors' bonds.
True, export earnings will also rise in response to the exchange rate
change. But the relevant external debt is owed by the government, not the
corporate sector. The more important question is whether, in an
inflation-induced political and economic crisis, the reduced cost of
servicing domestic debt will leave room to look after the external debtors.
The experience of the Latin American debt crisis offers no encouragement on
this score. And where countries are running a primary budget deficit, such
as in Sweden and Spain (see table), holders of foreign currency debt are
much more heavily at risk than the market recognises.
What would happen if it came to the crunch? An obvious model would be the
period under the last Labour government when fiscal rigour was imposed on
the UK with a little arm-twisting from the International Monetary Fund. But
there was also help, at that time, from global inflation and negative real
rates of interest on Britain's external debt. No such help will be
forthcoming in a world choc-a-bloc with bond market vigilantes. Nor will a
government that is running a primary budget surplus necessarily feel the
need to call on the services of the IMF.
Default need not happen, of course. Both Ireland and Denmark have shown that
debt stabilisation through fiscal adjustment is possible. With high real
rates, the benefits from fiscal discipline are striking and immediate. Once
markets detect signs of political will, the virtuous circle of falling
rates, lower debt service, reduced budget deficits and shrinking risk premia
can be quickly established.
The snag is the scale of the problem. Consider Sweden, where David Roche
estimates that it would take a monumental fiscal adjustment of 12 per cent
of GDP just to start stabilising the public debt. Yet Sweden has the highest
level of public spending in the developed world - over 70 per cent of GDP
last year - for good reason: the people like their welfare state. Yet they
also feel over-taxed.
The message is that judgements about bond yields in inidividual countries
are more than ever to do with politics. And it seems unlikely that the more
general problem of high real rates will go away quickly, since the pressure
on capital markets remains formidable. While the level of savings in the
OECD is significantly lower than in the period before 1974, debt has been
rising inexorably. The OECD projects that between 1978 and the end of this
year net public sector debt will have risen from 21 per cent to 42 per cent
of GDP.
That suggests, pace the central bankers, that there could indeed be a
serious inflationary problem. The markets cannot convince themselves that
electorates are prepared to meet the ever-soaring bill for the welfare
state. If the vigilantes are nodding, it is in being over-optimistic about
the servicing of foreign currency indebtedness. But sooner or later the
Southern Comfort zone will deliver a default. The more interesting question
is whether the UK will be a victim or beneficiary of the resulting flight to

FT  31 OCT 94 / Economics Notebook: An economics of corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sleaze can have political costs, but what about the economic side of the
equation? In the past, economists usually assumed corruption was an economic
'bad', and left the more detailed theories to their colleagues in the
political science department. Yet analysis of economies with very different
styles of political crookedness has made them think again.
Drawing on their experience helping to implement reforms in formerly
communist countries, two Harvard economists, Andrei Shleifer and Robert
Vishny, have come to the conclusion that being able to bribe politicians is
not always a bad thing. As always, it depends on the options.
One way to see bribes in a more positive light is to view them as a furtive
form of taxation. Instead of paying for high public sector wages through
general taxation, people in corrupt countries end up footing the bill more
directly, bribing officials in return for passports, import licences, or
other forms of patronage.
At best, this sort of bribe is like a 'hypothecated', or earmarked, tax. The
official is performing a service - stamping a passport with the correct
visa, for example - and the bribe allows the user of the service to pay for
some of the labour costs directly. In this ideal case, taxpayers who never
go abroad might even benefit, because corrupt customs officials should
insist on lower wages than honest ones.
When bureaucratic and political interference is widespread, it is more
difficult to see bribes as an extra tax for public goods. But in these
circumstances, paying officials not to do their job is better than paying
them to do it. When individuals and businessmen face a web of cumbersome
rules and regulations, the economy could end up more productive if bribes
prevent pointless restrictions from being enforced.
In the real world, of course, the effects of corruption will rarely be so
benign: the very fact that bribes must be kept secret will make them less
efficient than a more transparent revenue-raising system. Unless the 'going
rate' for a given service is very well known, the additional uncertainty
will severely undermine the prospects for investment and growth.
But just as there are better and worse ways to collect taxes, some systems
of corruption will be a lot more harmful to the economy than others.
Predictably, the two economists argue that the costs will depend on whether
the market for political favours is competitive, and how well it is
regulated.
When there are plenty of officials in a position to provide a particular
good, bribes will be kept down because the public can always seek a lower
price elsewhere.
Corruption is more of a problem when officials have a degree of monopoly
power: awarding import licences in a particular sector, for example. This
could mean a very high 'tax' on the companies concerned, leading to
artificially high prices. Nevertheless, it will rarely be in the official's
interest to put all his customers out of business.
The real trouble comes when doing business in a given market involves buying
off not one, but dozens of individual monopolists, each asking to be paid
off for providing (or forgetting about) a particular licence or permit. If
there is nothing regulating who can ask for bribes and how much they can
ask, firms may simply move abroad if they can, or else give up doing
business altogether.
Unco-ordinated, bureaucratic fiefdoms will tend to corrupt themselves out of
a living: the economy becomes so burdened with the cost of corruption that
it simply ceases to function. The monopolists need to co-ordinate their
activities, and for that there must be a single source of power to enforce
the system.
According to the authors, this explains why some countries have managed to
cope with high levels of corruption better than others. Where there is one
mafia or political party effectively controlling the system, only 'insiders'
can demand bribes, and they will be penalised if they demand more than the
going rate. This was probably the case in Soviet Russia. Now, however, the
country has the most damaging combination of all: thousands of people with
an instinct for working the system, and almost no central authority capable
of regulating their actions.
Whether corruption is viewed as a tax, or a way of reducing regulation,
neither argument suggests that corruption is optimal. Indeed, in the latter
case, many silly regulations may be imposed by officials, precisely in order
to earn money taking bribes to ignore them. The bribes may lessen the
negative effects of these rules, but it would obviously be better not to
have them in the first place.
More generally, companies that specialise in currying political favour will
devote less time and resources to making a better product. If firms would
otherwise be able to compete on their merits, widespread corruption is
clearly worse for the economy.
This is consistent with various studies suggesting that corrupt economies
tend to have low rates of investment and growth. As Profs Shleifer and
Vishny note; 'corruption goes hand in hand with political control. The
empirical result that corruption is bad for growth simply reflects the fact
that heavy government regulation is bad for growth.' As ever, competition
between politicians will be the best way to cure the system.

'Politicians and Firms', Harvard Mimeo, July 1994.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Markets: Metal exchange moves house - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With many of its contract prices at or near recent highs and volumes booming
in most of its markets, the London Metal Exchange could hardly have chosen a
more auspicious moment for today's move to bigger premises.
At about 26,000 sq ft the purpose-built premises in Leadenhall Street in the
City doubles the exchange's space, allowing the provision of expanded
technological facilities to cope with rising trading volumes.
Total turnover this year is expected to grow by between 20 and 30 per cent
from 1993's record of 35.28m lots, taking the average daily trading value to
about Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.1bn).
Traders may have little leisure to savour their new surroundings, if last
week's performance is anything to go by. After a hectic five days, all six
of the LME's base metals contracts ended with net gains, notably copper, the
exchange's flagship, which rose by nearly 4 per cent, and aluminium, up 4.2
per cent.
Fears remain that the speed of the recent price rises could result in sharp
corrections for 'overbought' markets. But the bulls will have been
encouraged by the fact that Friday's bout of end-of-the-week profit-taking
generally found good support not far below ruling price levels.
The LME will meet fresh competition from tomorrow, when the Shanghai Metals
Exchange launches standard futures for lead, zinc, nickel and tin. But there
seems no reason for concern that its pre-eminent position in international
metals trading could seriously be threatened.
Other events this week include a three-day conference, beginning today in
Vancouver, Canada, on Latin American Mining and, possibly, the publication
of the keenly-awaited official assessment of frost and drought damage to the
1995-96 Brazilian coffee crop. Uncertainty about this crop and weather
prospects in coffee-growing regions has led to a slow-down in trading
activity at the London Commodity Exchange and a substantial retracement in
contract prices.

FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Union Pacific raises offer for
Santa Fe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The battle to create the largest railway network in the US intensified
further yesterday when Union Pacific raised its takeover bid for Santa Fe
Pacific to Dollars 3.8bn from Dollars 3.2bn, about Dollars 600m more than
offered by rival railway operator Burlington Northern.
In an attempt to put pressure on Santa Fe shareholders, who are due to vote
on the proposed Burlington merger on November 15, Union Pacific said its new
offer was contingent on Santa Fe immediately terminating merger talks with
Burlington.
Last night, Santa Fe did not say it would stop talking to Burlington, but
promised to consider the new offer from Union Pacific. However, the Santa Fe
management, which has recommended that shareholders accept Burlington's
offer, warned it was unlikely that a merger with Union Pacific would receive
the approval of federal regulators.
Ever since Union Pacific offered to buy Santa Fe, doubts have been expressed
over whether the government would allow a merger between two railways whose
prime routes are in direct competition with each other. Union Pacific has
responded by saying that a panel of industry experts it hired to study its
bid had concluded that the merger stood a good chance of being approved by
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Union Pacific raised its bid for Santa Fe over the weekend because
Burlington last week increased its original offer of Dollars 2.6bn to
Dollars 3.2bn. If that deal is approved by shareholders, it will create the
biggest freight railroad system in the US, joining two complementary
networks spreading from the west coast to the midwest.
Union Pacific's latest offer, worth Dollars 20 a share, represents a 29 per
cent premium over Santa Fe's current stock price of Dollars 15 1/2.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Consolidated earnings at Argentaria, the majority state-controlled Spanish
banking group, edged up by 2.1 per cent before tax in the first nine months
of the year to Pta84.77bn (Dollars 684m).
Net profit, excluding minority interests, showed a stronger rise of 8.8 per
cent to Pta57.72bn.
The results came after a 19 per cent increase in loan recoveries to
Pta31.69bn and a 46 per cent reduction in provisions for loan losses and
country risk to Pta35.5bn.
This was offset by sharply lower earnings from securities, which fell by 88
per cent to Pta3.33bn from Pta23.54bn.
Operating income for the nine months improved by 10.5 per cent to
Pta101.67bn. The group, in which the government stake is due to be reduced
to a minority through a further share offering next year, said this
reflected a 'satisfactory' performance.
The next privatisation tranche, originally expected this year, has been put
back because of the weak stock market trend, and is now not expected before
the spring.
Argentaria's total assets at the end of September stood at Pta11,100bn, 7
per cent higher than a year earlier.

Esselte, the Swedish office products group, saw profits rise by 27 per cent
to SKr261m (Dollars 36m) from SKr205m in the nine months to September.
Sales advanced by 2 per cent to SKr8.82bn and margins improved but sales in
the US, its most important market, were affected by a product substitution
programme. Lower hedging income increased costs by SKr40m to SKr143m.
The company expects full-year profits to be around SKr400m, compared with
SKr301m last year.
Mr Bo Lundquist, chief executive, said sales had developed well in western
Europe and the Far East. 'The market for office products is continuing to
increase,' he said.
The strongest divisional performance came from Esselte Dymo, the main office
products unit, where operating profits rose to SKr215m from SKr167m.

Vard, the struggling Norwegian cruise group, saw pre-tax losses, before
extraordinary items, widen to NKr108.4m (Dollars 16.52m) for the nine months
to September, from NKr79.3m last time.
However, the figures were distorted by the disposal of the ferry business
and the sale of one cruise ship. This resulted in one of Vard's three cruise
businesses being sold and the remaining two being reorganised.
The pre-tax result, after extraordinary items, was a profit of NKr542.1m,
against a loss of NKr148.9m last year. There were extraordinary gains of
NKr650.4m, against charges of NKr69.6m a year earlier.
Group operating profit slipped to NKr440m from NKr479m as sales fell by
NKr379m to NKr5.08bn.
Net profit was NKr390.28m, against a loss of NKr107.21m.

this year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JVC, the Japanese manufacturer of consumer audio-visual equipment, has
posted a recurring first-half loss and passed its interim dividend. The
group, however, managed to increase sales slightly in an extremely
competitive market.
Non-consolidated sales in the six months were Y259.7bn (Dollars 2.66bn),
compared with Y251.4bn a year earlier. However, JVC still suffered a loss of
Y1.9bn, although this was an improvement over the Y9.8bn loss made in the
previous first half. The net loss was cut to Y2.9bn from Y10.6bn.
JVC, which has been undergoing restructuring, said the yen's rapid
appreciation against leading currencies had offset efforts to reshape the
company.
In addition, JVC, like other Japanese consumer electronics groups, has faced
tougher competition in its own market.
The consumer electronics market in Japan has been increasingly characterised
by lower-priced products as consumers hold back from expensive purchases.
Cheap audio-visual products have been coming into the country from
lower-cost countries in the rest of Asia.
JVC said it expected further turbulence as the yen continued to remain at a
high level while competition in the audio-visual market was likely to remain
fierce.
It is forecasting that sales in the full year will reach Y530bn, against
Y507.7bn, and hopes to return to the black with recurring profits of Y1bn,
against a loss of Y19.5bn.

FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Benetton-led move changes shape
of Italian retailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The shape of the Italian stores market will change significantly as a result
of IRI, the state holding company, awarding its GS-Autogrill group to a
consortium headed by Benetton, the clothing group.
The Italo-Swiss consortium, headed by Benetton, put in the winning bid for
GS-Autogrill, the last part of the SME foodstuffs group to be privatised,
late last Thursday.
The deal marks the first large scale diversification by Benetton into a new
area of business. It also signals the entry of a new foreign player,
Movenpick, the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, into a sector whose
development lags behind other EU countries.
The winning consortium also includes Mr Leonardo Del Vecchio, whose
Luxottica spectacles group has been one of the most successful business
ventures in northern Italy. Like the Benetton family, this represents a
considerable diversification.
The award will be ratified by a special IRI shareholders meeting on November
4. Until then the treasury, the sole shareholder, has indicated it would not
reveal the terms of the deal. However, the bid by the Italo-Swiss consortium
is believed to have valued GS-Autogrill at L2,100bn (Dollars 1.33bn), some
L300bn above its market capitalisation.
The bid was won against strong competition from a purely Italian consortium
headed by Rinascente, the stores group controlled by the Agnelli family. In
choosing the Italo-Swiss consortium IRI appeared to be swayed by a desire to
bring in new blood.
Originally, premier Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group, which has a large
stores division through Standa, was interested. But analysts said Standa did
not pursue a bid partly because of concern over raising a conflict of
interest between Mr Berlusconi's ownership of Standa and his role as prime
minister.
GS-Autogrill is the last of the three divisions owned by SME, the foodstuffs
group that has been privatised by IRI over the past 18 months. The other two
were Italgel (frozen foods) and Cirio Bertoli De Rica (canned foods, oil,
and milk). In 1993 GS-Autogrill made a L132bn net profit on turnover of
L4,068bn.
IRI controls 62.3 per cent of SME, and the offer was for 32 per cent. The
winning consortium will be obliged to launch an offer for at least 20 per
cent of the minority shares; IRI has guaranteed to sell the bulk of its
remaining holding to the consortium.
One of the terms of the award is understood to be a commitment to keep the
stores and restaurant elements of GS-Autogrill together for five years. One
of the attractions of the group has been to split the two.

FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hungary considers early sale of
telecom shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hungary is considering a quick sale of state shares in Matav, the national
telecommunications company, that would dwarf all previous international
equity offerings to come out of eastern Europe.
At the top of the agenda is a proposal to sell up to 10 per cent of Matav
through a private placement with international institutional investors which
could raise up to Dollars 300m.
Finance ministry and Matav officials said they had not reached a final
decision but were exploring options, including that of a private placement.
'That is the question we are discussing night and day,' said Mr Mark von
Lillienskiold, an executive director of Matav.
A closed offer of Matav shares targeted at western pension and emerging
market funds would provide a foretaste of a more comprehensive initial
public offering planned for 1995-1996. The mandate to advise on the initial
placement is expected to be one of the most lucrative awarded in the region
and hotly contested by investment banks.
Although about Dollars 4bn in western portfolio investment has flowed into
Russia and other east European countries in the last year, most equity has
been purchased in small tranches on secondary markets.
The sale of Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m worth of Matav would far surpass
the Dollars 70m issue by Hungarian retailer Fotex to become the largest
single international equity offering by an east European company.
An issue of this scale is too much to be absorbed solely by funds
specialising on eastern Europe or emerging markets in general. Mainstream
pension funds, however, are expected to require more complete accounts than
Matav can provide at the moment.
Budgetary difficulties have encouraged the Hungarian authorities to bring
forward the Matav privatisation. The new Socialist government has declared
it will use privatisation revenues to pay down the national debt.
Deutsche Telekom of Germany and Ameritech of the US, which last December
took a joint stake of 30 per cent in Matav, have also softened their
opposition to an early offering.
Ameritech in particular had opposed a quick flotation because the price
would have been below that at which it entered and it would have had to
write down its investment. Salomon Brothers, hired by Matav to study an IPO,
recommended that it wait until late 1995 or early 1996.
However, Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech now appear ready to accept a
compromise whereby the government gets rapid proceeds through a private
placement but a full IPO takes place in a more leisurely fashion. They are
also discussing a possible increase in their stake.

North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian resources group, has warned
shareholders that it expected a fall in profits in the current year, due to
lower iron ore prices and the absence of any early improvement in the
uranium market, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
Mr Michael Deeley, NBH Peko chairman, told the company's annual meeting that
the Northparkes mine would not start copper production until 1995-6.
Meanwhile, he said, exploration expenditure would be rising.
He conceded that group sales would strengthen generally as economic growth
picked up in the industrialised world, but said that the group expected
operating profits to be 'slightly below' those of 1993-4. 'We do not expect
significant abnormal profits to arise during the year,' he added.
In the year to end-June, North Broken Hill Peko made an operating profit
after tax of ADollars 185.3m, (USDollars 136.2m) which included net abnormal
profits of ADollars 65.2m.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Credito Romagnolo, the Bologna-based regional bank, is expected to call in
foreign advisers to help ward off a hostile bid by Credito Italiano, Italy's
fifth largest commercial bank.
The bid, offering L19,000 per share for 48.2 per cent of Credito Romagnolo's
stock, was rejected at a special board meeting on Friday. If Credito
Italiano were successful it would create Italy's largest private bank.
The offer by Credito Italiano is worth L2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn) and was
launched last Wednesday after concerted buying of Credito Romagnolo stock.
Credito Italiano holds just over 2 per cent of the shares.
The move has already profoundly shaken the banking sector.
Credito Romagnolo, which is controlled by a core of shareholders led by
Olivetti chairman Mr Carlo De Benedetti, is understood to be considering
recruiting at least one and perhaps two foreign advisers.
Those being mentioned over the weekend included Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs International.
Their task would be to assess the value of Credito Romagnolo and to draw up
a possible list of 'white knights' that might be interested in helping fight
the takeover.
Under existing statutes, no shareholder of the Bologna-based bank can own
more than 10 per cent.
Credito Italiano would need the support of at least 20 per cent of the
shareholders to call a special meeting to amend the statutes and allow
majority control.
Objections to the deal have centred on the price and the threat to Credito
Romagnolo's identity.
Although the price represents a sharp premium on the L13,674 pre-bid value,
those shareholders tempted to sell are thought unlikely to accept the first
offer - not least because it covers less than half the stock.
The stronger objection comes from those who believe a highly profitable
regional bank such as Credito Romagnolo risks losing its identity in the
bigger and more ungainly Credito Italiano.
Local Bologna politicians have begun to organise a campaign to prevent the
bank being taken over, in spite of Mr Lucio Rondelli, chairman of Credito
Italiano, saying that such fears were unfounded.

FT  31 OCT 94 / UK Company News: European groups 'on US buying spree' -
Foreign investment jumped to Dollars 32.5bn in the first nine months, says
KPMG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK, Swiss and other European companies have been on a buying spree in the
US, according to a report by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
Led by Roche of Switzerland's Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.35bn) purchase of
Syntex Corporation, foreign companies invested Dollars 32.5bn (Pounds
20.5bn) in outright acquisitions in the US in the first nine months of this
year. Deals into the US were higher than at any time this decade, according
to KPMG.
Takeover activity across the Atlantic rose 126 per cent on the corresponding
period of 1993, said KPMG. Much of the increase came from deals of more than
Dollars 500m - the total number of transactions was little changed.
Transatlantic M&amp;A deals, like US domestic transactions, have been
concentrated in a few sectors where consolidation is advancing most rapidly.
With SmithKline Beecham of the UK buying Sterling Health, as well as Roche
buying Syntex, deals in the chemicals and drugs sector amounted to Dollars
11bn.
Sandoz of Switzerland paid Dollars 3.7bn for Gerber Products, a US food
company, underpinning Dollars 6bn of acquisitions in the food and drink
sector.
'A combination of a relatively weak dollar and the fact that the US economy
is leading the emergence from recession makes the US an attractive place to
seek acquisitions,' said Mr Richard Agutter, chairman of KPMG's corporate
finance network.
Some investment bankers said the surge in transatlantic activity reflected
no more than the vitality of the US market. 'The basic fact is that the US
M&amp;A market is dramatically up,' said Mr Stephen Hester, joint-head of
European investment banking for CSFB. 'That is just as true of domestic as
it is of transatlantic.'
Investment bankers expect the flow of deals in the US to continue, as the
restructuring that has driven acquisitions progresses. Some also report that
US companies are beginning to look more seriously at expansion in Europe.
'Interest is there, even though volume is flat,' said an M&amp;A specialist with
one of the largest US investment banks. 'We expect activity in the opposite
direction to pick up considerably.'
However, cross-border European M&amp;A activity is at its lowest level for
several years, according to a recent survey by Securities Data Company.

FT  31 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Caught with its defences down - Weakened by
financial difficulties, Scantronic is ripe for takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The alarm bells are ringing at Scantronic Holdings as potential bidders
prepare to raid the security components group.
Shares have plunged from a high of 89p this year to 20 1/2 p at the end of
last week, as Scantronic's net debt climbed to Pounds 11.2m last June, up
from Pounds 3.5m in March 1993.
Two weeks ago the company won shareholder agreement to raise Pounds 2.8m in
new equity and borrowings. The deeply discounted offer of 16.1m shares at
10p is expected to raise Pounds 1.2m, and was a condition of new banking
facilities of Pounds 1.6m.
The board announced there would be pre-tax losses of about Pounds 2.4m for
the six months to September 30, against profits of Pounds 1.4m last year. It
also declared there would be no dividend payments, including preference
dividends, for this year.
Last week Menvier-Swain, the emergency lighting and alarms manufacturer,
announced its interest in making a bid for Scantronic.
The company - which reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.36m on turnover of
Pounds 70.3m in the year to April - purchased 550,000 Scantronic shares to
raise its stake to 1.64m shares, or 4.49 per cent of the company.
Ruth Keattch, analyst at Granville Davies, said: 'I don't think the
Scantronic board enjoys any sympathy with the institutional shareholders.
'They had a good business in the UK: a leading brand with probably 50 per
cent of the intruder alarm systems market. But they took their eye off the
ball and went on a mission to expand in the US, which was truly disastrous.'
Scantronic's cash difficulties began last year with the acquisition of
Alarmexpress Holdings, the UK security equipment distributor. In December,
Scantronic placed 1.73m shares to fund growth at the new subsidiary.
By April the board acquired 20 per cent of Arius, the US distributor of
security products. The investment, along with the Alarmexpress acquisition
and expansion, cost Scantronic Pounds 5.3m.
In July the company announced the departure of its finance director, Mr Ray
Dias, claiming that he had failed to alert the board to the twin impact of
increased borrowing and difficult trading conditions.
The company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.89m (Pounds 1.27m) for the
year to March 31, compared with a statement in July that it would make
profits of at least Pounds 2.75m.
Turnover rose from Pounds 39.1m to Pounds 50.2m, but the core UK
manufacturing business saw operating profits fall from Pounds 3.3m to Pounds
2.59m, primarily due to lower sales to the Continent.
Patrick Hickey, analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, said: 'At the end of the
day, this is a case of management overstretching its ability. The tragedy is
that it is basically a good business in the UK, but it is not a product for
the US.
'Earlier this year they ran into problems because of a lack of financial
controls. They ended up with a lot more stock and a lot less cash than they
thought.
'There are also very heavy borrowings. Given the history of the past six
months, there has to be a consideration that there may be financial holes.'
However, Mr John Singer, finance director, refused to comment on the
company's financial position.
Alongside Menvier-Swain, there are rumours that Silvermines, the
Dublin-based electrical services and property group, is interested in making
a bid.
In February, Silvermines made an agreed offer of IPounds 5.17m for Molynx
Holdings, the closed circuit television and security systems maker.
'Menvier-Swain would be a perfect buyer because they are big in emergency
lighting and fire alarms, which is very similar to intruder alarm
technology,' said Ruth Keattch.
'Silvermines would also love to be bigger in the security systems market. If
Menvier-Swain are serious they are the most credible bidder, but it could
evolve into a bit of an auction if someone like Silvermines makes a bid.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Caparo secures Sharon assets in Dollars 26m
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Caparo Group, the private UK steel and engineering concern, has clinched its
bid to become a big player in the US steel market by buying most of the
assets of Sharon Speciality Steel for Dollars 26m (Pounds 16.4m) cash.
A US court has finally approved the offer for Sharon, which has been in
Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code since November 1992.
The UK group, founded and chaired by Dr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian
businessman, has paid a Dollars 3.5m deposit and expects to complete the
deal on November 15.
The purchase will end a long battle by Dr Paul to buy Sharon, based in the
steel town of Sharon, Pennsylvania.
In late July Caparo signed a letter of intent to buy Sharon, but slipped out
of the running this autumn when a rival Dollars 35m bid emerged. When this
fell through, however, Caparo was left with the field clear.
Caparo already has some steel products businesses in the US, notably Bull
Moose Tube, acquired in 1988. The Sharon acquisition, however, will give
Caparo its first steelmaking facilities anywhere In the world.
Dr Paul estimates that Caparo will become a Dollars 1bn company by 1986,
with Dollars 400m coming from Sharon. Last year, Caparo had world-wide group
sales of Pounds 360m .
Sharon, which has had a chequered past and formerly employed 2,000 people,
is not currently producing steel. Dr Paul says he hopes to restart
production by April, with about 500 workers.
'I am delighted and relieved that we have finally bought Sharon,' said Dr
Paul, who has negotiated an agreement with the United Steelworkers of
America on representation at the plant.
Apart from the purchase price, Caparo will spend an initial Dollars 20m to
restart production at Sharon. The plant will produce about 1.25m tons of
steel a year, with 900,000 tons coming from its electric arc furnaces and
the rest, initially, from bought-in slabs.
Electric arc furnace capacity will subsequently be increased. Caparo is not
buying Sharon's blast furnace - Dr Paul says he does not want to inherit any
environmental problems.

FT  31 OCT 94 / International Company News: Fyffes buys IPounds 5m stake in
Jamaican venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fyffes, the Dublin-based fruit and vegetables distributor, is to pay IPounds
5m (Pounds 4.94m) for 40 per cent of a new Jamaican banana company.
Jamaica Banana Holdings has been formed along with the Jamaican Government
and Jamaica Producers Group, a Jamaican quoted producer, to acquire two
large estates which together cultivate 3,000 acres of bananas.
The deal is part of the continuing privatisation of the Jamaican banana
industry. The government is understood to have just 5 per cent of the new
group.
Fyffes, which markets about a third of Jamaican banana production, said the
existing arrangements would continue unchanged.
Earlier this week Fyffes made its sixth move in continental Europe in the
last 18 months. It bought 50 per cent of Tropic International, a French
fresh produce group which is expected to have sales of IPounds 30m this
year.
The consideration is understood to be about IPounds 1.5m. The acquisition
lifts Fyffes' total annualised turnover in France to IPounds 100m.
Fyffes is now jostling with Geest and Dole for second place behind Chiquita
in the European fruit distribution market. In addition to France it operates
in Spain, Denmark, Holland and Germany.

FT  31 OCT 94 / National Power takes another step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Hub project marks an important step in National Power's ambitions to
invest Pounds 1bn overseas by the end of the decade to compensate for loss
of domestic market share to independent power generators, writes David
Lascelles.
The privatised power generation company, the UK's largest, now has about 5
per cent of its generating capacity outside the UK, according to Mr Graham
Hadley, its managing director for international business development, and
with Hub its overseas investment will amount to Pounds 250m. 'That's
starting to give us a track record', he said.
National Power's other investments include American National Power in
Houston, the Pego coal-fired power station in Portugal, and a share in a
Spanish clean-coal technology plant.
Projects in the pipeline include power stations in India and China. Mr
Hadley saw prospects in the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, Poland and the
Czech Republic. The company is also looking at Morocco, Turkey, Indonesia,
Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Mickey Mouse awaits Discovery
Mountain - Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Euro Disney is expected to report continuing heavy losses when it publishes
its results for the year to September 30 on Thursday. Some analysts have
predicted losses of more than FFr1.6bn (Pounds 191m), down from losses of
FFr5.3bn last year as the theme park continues to cope with its start-up
costs.
The results will be the first since the park arranged a FFr13bn
restructuring with its banks in June.
Mr Philippe Bourgignon, chairman, believes the results this year must be put
in the perspective of the restructuring and will give little idea of its
future likelihood of success. He recently stressed that the park was still
on target to break even by the end of the 1996 financial year, and that
creditor banks were content with its performance.
Analysts and shareholders, however, will be closely examining many aspects
of the results, and above all the attendance figures, which showed a
downward decline in visitors to 9m last year from 9.8m the year before.
They will also scrutinise changes to the levels of expenditure by visitors
to the park, and the impact of changes to the tariffs at hotels and
restaurants.
The company is pinning its hopes on approaches including changes in
management, a new marketing strategy and the opening next year of Discovery
Mountain, its latest attraction.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Public and private meet at the Hub: A pioneering
project-finance deal in Pakistan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON and FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After six gruelling years of preparation, it is finally done. The completion
this weekend of a Dollars 30m share issue in Karachi effectively means the
last piece of financing has fallen into place for Pakistan's Dollars 1.6bn
(Pounds 1bn) Hub power project which will add 13 per cent to the country's
generating capacity by 1997.
The project, in which Britain's National Power invested Dollars 100m for a
25 per cent equity stake, will almost certainly go down as a landmark in the
private sector financing of infrastructure development in the third world.
Negotiated through eight changes of government in Pakistan, it required
legal documentation weighing 28kg a set. So large was the cast involved that
at one stage new participants found it virtually impossible to find a lawyer
in London who was not constrained by conflict of interest.
Out of all this has come what National Power describes as a 'trail-blazing'
deal for financing private sector infrastructure projects that pioneers the
use of World Bank resources. Traditionally it lends only to governments.
According to Mr Patrick Crawford of Morgan Grenfell, which advised on the
deal, it has also involved the first successful international equity offer
for a power station which had yet to be built.
Last but not least, the sponsors, including National Power and Xenel, a
Saudi company which originally conceived the project, have had to reconcile
awkward clashes between western banking and Islamic law which bars
interest-bearing transactions.
The deal was born out of the need to increase electricity supply in a
country whose development has been impeded by chronic shortages of power but
whose government lacks the funds to develop new generating capacity. It
provides for a consortium led by Mitsui and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy
Industries to build an oil-powered thermal power station with a gross
capacity of 1,292MW. It will be operated by National Power.
Assembling the finance at a time when banks were unwilling to lend large
amounts to developing countries was an awesome task. Essentially the
structure involves a complex allocation of risk that prevents equity
investors and lending banks having to shoulder too much of the burden.
Of the Dollars 1.78bn raised for the project, including Dollars 220m in
standby credit, only Dollars 175m has been raised from international and
local equity investors and Dollars 686m from international banks.
Thanks to guarantees provided by the World Bank, as well as France, Italy
and Japan, the banks were spared the need to take on the political risk of
default stemming from actions by the government. They have only taken on the
commercial risk of the project itself. Despite its complexity, the 12-year
credit proved popular and was more than twice subscribed, according to
Citibank which led the syndication. A further buffer was provided through a
Dollars 582m subordinated loan from World Bank's private sector energy
development fund. Money from this fund is lent first to the government of
Pakistan and then passed on to the project in a back-to-back transaction to
get round the constraint on private sector lending by the bank.
That also helped reduce the need for outside equity. The international offer
was about two times subscribed and traded at the end of last week at a
premium of more than 10 per cent above its issue price, according to Mr Ric
Haller of Morgan Grenfell which handled the sale.
Two years ago, he says, it would have been difficult to place the equity
because of the troubled economic and political situation in Pakistan and
because the fashion for emerging market issues had not developed. As it is,
the company was able to offer the shares on a projected net real earnings
yield of 17.3 per cent in dollar terms, thanks to the intricate web of
operating arrangements struck by the project sponsors with suppliers and
customers. 'We had to make sure that National Power was going to be able to
manage the plant within the parameters that were predicted and that the
government of Pakistan, no matter what its hue, would live up to its
commitments,' he said.
'Where we are sitting today, we are sitting on a success story,' says Mr
Daniel Woodroffe, the project's chief executive. Bankers say it nearly
foundered after Pakistan's Islamic sharia court ruled in 1990 that all
interest-bearing transactions must stop. That called in question the
participation of local banks who were due to contribute a rupee loan for the
equivalent of Dollars 100m.
The then government of Mr Nawaz Sharif appealed against the judgment to the
supreme court but, although the appeal has not been heard, investors have
been given assurances that foreign private investors will not be affected by
any change in the law.
Bankers say the willingness of National Power to invest as much as Dollars
100m helped boost confidence. 'When we started, we did not have a remit to
invest overseas,' says Mr Graham Hadley, National Power executive director.
'We looked at Hub as we started to move more overseas and decided that this
was a project where the investment would prove attractive.'
Perhaps the most daunting task of all was to assemble the various
inter-dependent agreements in such a way that they would become operative at
once. 'The debt was conditional on the equity and the equity was conditional
on the debt, and everything was conditional on the World Bank and the
sponsors. Someone had to blink first,' says Mr Haller.
What unlocked the bank loan in the end was Morgan Grenfell's decision,
together with its parent Deutsche Bank, to underwrite the international
equity issue instead of using the more conventional book-building approach.
Nonetheless the project remains a bold one. Up to 33 per cent of the power
generated by Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation is lost in transmission
line failures and power thefts. and many consumers have not paid their bills
for years.
Since coming to office last year, the government of Mrs Benazir Bhutto has
promised to press ahead with new laws to punish offenders and improve the
quality of transmission facilities.
Investors in Hub will now wait to see whether the risk pays off. But, unlike
Eurotunnel, that celebrated first-world project, Hub is running on schedule
and within budget. There is every chance that Mr Hadley will be proved right
when he says 'the essence of what has been done here is eminently
transferable. We will get this kind of package being put together again in
Pakistan and other countries as well.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Pharmaceuticals future holds the
spotlight - Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Speculation over the future of Boots' pharmaceuticals division is expected
to overshadow sharply improved interim figures from the retailing and drugs
group on Thursday.
Although the company is expected to highlight an increase of about 33 per
cent in first-half profits, analysts are likely to focus on the outcome of
the year-long review of the drugs business. The review was prompted by last
year's withdrawal of the heart drug Manoplax, which left a gap in products
under development.
Boots officials insist they are under no pressure to sell the business,
which remains both profitable and cash generative. Options include disposal,
merger or a joint venture.
Rumours that disposal was the favoured choice were heightened earlier this
year when Boots issued a confidential sales memorandum for potential
bidders. While confirming it is in discussions with a number of companies,
the group remains coy about its intentions.
Names touted include Zeneca, Britain's third-largest drug group, and Medeva,
the acquisitive drugs company. Their interest is understood to have waned in
recent months, only to be replaced by speculation on possible bids from
Knoll, the BASF subsidiary, and Menarini of Italy. The attraction is the
pharmaceuticals division's lucrative distribution and marketing operations
in the US, rather than the UK research and development facilities.
Interim pre-tax profits are forecast to have risen from Pounds 174.6m to
about Pounds 233m. Last year's figures were depressed by a Pounds 35m charge
to cover the Manoplax withdrawal and a Pounds 5.1m write off on Asilone, an
antacid product. The chemists' chain, however, is expected to remain the
most profitable division.
Analysts are looking for an increased interim dividend of about 5.5p,
against 4.9p last time.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Banks vie for Deutsche Telekom sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The German government will announce in the next few days which banks are to
play the leading roles in the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, with
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, the most likely candidate to handle
the international placing.
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, and Dresdner Bank are expected
jointly to head the overall issue, set for early 1996, under which a
minority of the shares in the German telecommunications concern will be sold
to raise at least DM10bn (Pounds 4bn). Out of more than 20 banks vying for
the lead foreign role, Goldman Sachs has emerged as the favourite to become
global co-ordinator.
As with the recent DM1bn partial privatisation of Lufthansa, the German
airline, the bookbuilding method of selecting long-term quality investors
from those keener on short-term gains will be used. The Lufthansa issue, led
by Dresdner Bank, was heavily subscribed.
For the much larger Deutsche Telekom issue - the state-owned telephone
monopoly's total value is put at some DM60bn - separate regional consortiums
are also planned to accommodate US, European and possibly Japanese
investors.
The choice of Goldman Sachs to head the international placing would irritate
some non-German European banks which feel one of them should have this role,
as Deutsche Telekom is a European concern.
UK merchant banks with experience of international flotations have taken
part in presentations, or 'beauty contests', in Bonn. They include SG
Warburg, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Kleinwort Benson, National Westminster
Bank, NM Rothschild and Robert Fleming.
The other US banks which put submissions to the postal and finance
ministries in Bonn - the official announcement will come from the former -
include Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Salomon Brothers.
Leading Swiss and French banks have also been involved.
Because of tough global competition in investment banking, Deutsche Bank
said on Friday it was putting its non-German investment banking activities
in London. It will combine them with those of Morgan Grenfell, its UK
merchant bank. International privatisations are among the areas in which the
German bank wants to build up its strength.

FT  31 OCT 94 / UBS seeks employee support in strategy battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland is again urging its 22,000 Swiss employees to vote
their shares in support of the directors in their proxy fight with Zurich
broker-fund manager Mr Martin Ebner over the bank's strategy.
At the moment the battle centres on the proposal by the UBS board to convert
the bank's registered shares into bearer shares, drastically reducing their
voting power. It has called an extraordinary general meeting for November 22
to vote on the proposal.
In a second letter to employees on the issue, Mr Nikolaus Senn, chairman,
and Mr Robert Studer, chief executive, have pleaded with employees to give
the directors an unconditional general proxy for voting their shares.
'Unfortunately, a large number of employees have not sent in a proxy form
for general meetings,' the letter says. 'In our view, this should be made
out unconditionally, not only for the approaching general meeting, but also
for the future.'
Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, president of BK Vision, the Ebner controlled
investment fund that is UBS's largest shareholder, said he regretted the
letter. 'In a good bank, the staff should be left to make their own
decision.'
UBS denied there was any pressure. 'Naturally, the bank wants to convince
its personnel' it said, and pointed out that an independent proxy holder had
been engaged for shareholders who wanted their vote to be private.
The registered shares now have a par value only one-fifth of that of the
bearer shares, but equal voting weight. UBS says BK Vision, which has an 18
per cent holding in them, seeks excessive influence over the bank on the
cheap.
BK Vision is trying to rally a majority of votes in favour of substantial
changes in the UBS board at next April's annual meeting when the terms of 10
of the 23 directors expire.
UBS employees, who can buy registered shares on very favourable terms, now
hold about 12 per cent of them, carrying 6.1 per cent of all votes.
The registered shares have lost more than half of the effective 40 per cent
premium they carried over the bearer shares since UBS revealed its proposal,
causing dismay among holders.

FT  31 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Surge in support may be
too late for Democrats - Republicans threaten to win control of US Senate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The good news for Democrats eight days before the US mid-term elections is
that a few closely watched races may be turning in their favour. The bad
news is that the trend may not be enough to stop big Republican gains,
including control of the Senate.
President Bill Clinton, fresh from a successful Middle East tour, with more
good economic news to tout and with an improvement registered in most public
opinion polls, hits the campaign trail in earnest today. He will focus on
tight contests where his presence, previously scorned by many Democratic
candidates, may now make a difference.
In California yesterday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Democratic incumbent
not far ahead of Congressman Michael Huffington, received an endorsement
from Mr Richard Riordan, Republican mayor of Los Angeles.
She hopes this will have a comparable impact to that given to Mr Mario
Cuomo, New York's Democratic governor, after receiving an unqualified nod of
approval last week from Mr Rudolph Giuliani, Republican mayor of New York
City. Mr Cuomo has at least pulled level with Mr George Pataki, his
Republican opponent. Ms Feinstein's lead over Mr Huffington had slipped from
nine points to three in the latest Los Angeles Times survey. But this was
taken before the Republican congressman, who has made curbs on illegal
immigration a centrepiece of his campaign, admitted employing a British
nanny in the US without proper immigration papers.
In Pennsylvania, Senator Harris Wofford, the Democrat, was endorsed by Mrs
Teresa Heinz, widow of the popular Republican senator killed in an aircraft
crash in 1991. She said his opponent, Congressman Rick Santorum, was 'short
on public service and even shorter on accomplishment'.
In Virginia, Mr Oliver North, the Republican candidate running Senator
Charles Robb about even, was battling to overcome criticism from Mrs Nancy
Reagan, wife of the former president, who accused Mr North of lying to and
about her husband.
But the bad news for Democrats stems from an analysis of all the polls in
the 35 Senate races due to be decided on November 8. The Democrats, with a
56-44 majority, can afford to lose no more than six seats to retain control.
Two seem lost already. In Maine, where Senator George Mitchell is retiring,
Republican Congresswoman Olympia Snowe holds an apparently insurmountable
lead over Congressman Tom Andrews. In Ohio, where Senator Howard Metzenbaum
is also retiring, Lt Gov Michael DeWine, the Republican, seems sure to beat
Mr Joel Hyatt, Senator Metzenbaum's son-in-law.
Arizona, being vacated by Senator Dennis DeConcini, had also seemed a lost
cause, though one poll last week found Congressman Sam Coppersmith, the
Democrat, pulling to within five points of Congressman John Kyl.
Ten other Senate contests are either leaning Republican or too close to
call. Of these, the seven endangered Democratic seats include four defended
by incumbents - Ms Feinstein, Mr Robb, Mr Wofford and Mr James Sasser in
Tennessee - and three left open by retirement, in Michigan, Oklahoma and the
second seat in Tennessee, formerly held by Mr Gore.
The polls are not always reliable. But, together with anecdotal reporting in
the US press, they tend to suggest that virtually everything will need to
break right for the Democrats to cling on to the Senate.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Israel eases West Bank closure: Casablanca deal grants
access to some Palestinian workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON

<DATELINE>
   CASABLANCA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel has agreed to begin lifting the closure of the Gaza Strip and West
Bank from tomorrow, easing the plight of more than 60,000 Palestinians
denied access to their Israeli workplaces.
Yesterday's move came as senior Israeli, Palestinian and European Union
officials started the Middle East and North Africa economic summit in
Casablanca with an urgent review of the economic crisis threatening the
Palestinian peace process.
The move was the first practical step taken at the three-day conference
opened last night by King Hassan of Morocco. The gathering of 10 heads of
government, 450 government officials and 1,100 business leaders from 60
countries is aimed at evolving new regional, financial and economic
institutions after Israel's recent peace agreements with the Palestinians
and Jordan, while encouraging private-sector investment in cross-border and
regional development projects.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, said an easing of the Gaza and
West Bank closure, enforced after the recent Hamas bombing of a civilian bus
in Tel Aviv, was agreed after talks between Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of
the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister.
From tomorrow, women, Palestinian men over 30 and those visiting hospitals
would be permitted to cross into Israel.
In later talks between Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, Mr
Arafat and Mr Abraham Shohat, Israel's finance minister, the EU agreed to
examine the hold-up of European funds for Gaza and the West Bank.
The EU has so far disbursed only Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.26m) of Dollars 120m
pledged to the Palestinian Authority.
The conference will close tomorrow with preparations for new regional
institutions and steps towards creating a Dollars 10bn regional development
bank.
This would mark the start of what Crown Prince Hassan, head of the Jordanian
delegation, described as a 'Middle East common market from the Atlantic to
the Gulf' with a GNP of Pounds 580bn.
However, while Mr Peres said the US, Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the
Palestinians agreed to back the development bank, Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor
of Israel's central bank, said he expected the institution would take two
years to set up. The bank is understood to have raised objections from
Britain and France.

FT  31 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US airlines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US airline industry no longer looks cyclical. Four years after the
economic recovery began, the sector should be enjoying a boom. But last
week's batch of third-quarter results was nothing to boast about - despite
the fact that the quarter is traditionally the year's best and fuel costs
remain low. Continental Airlines' net margins were just 2 per cent, while
USAir was in the red. Even AMR, the strongest of the large carriers,
achieved margins of only 5 per cent.
The industry's big problem is the ease with which low-cost, low-fare
airlines can enter the market offering no-frills services. Aircraft leases
are cheap, trained pilots are available and few US airports have slot
shortages. The low-cost groups control roughly a third of all capacity in
the US. Their heavy price discounting has reduced yields - average revenue
per passenger - throughout the industry.
Some airlines, such as United and Continental, have responded by launching
their own low-cost subsidiaries. The jury is still out whether they can
create the right culture. Continental's failed to break even after a year,
prompting the chief executive's resignation last week. Others such as
American and Delta are concentrating on cutting costs. The problem is that
such attempts at self-help will not return the industry to good health so
long as aircraft manufacturers continue to subsidise financing and Chapter
11 protects airlines from bankruptcy. Until then, most airlines will be
hard-pressed to earn decent returns on capital.

FT  31 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Noyaux durs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The forthcoming Renault share sale has brought France's system of noyaux
durs - or stable shareholders - into sharp relief once again. Rhone-Poulenc
has become the first industrial partner to apply for shares in the
automotive company. There is precious little industrial logic in such a
stake, much as the chemical group argues there will be synergies developing
fuel additives for diesel engines.
The financial logic is similarly threadbare. Heavily indebted Rhone-Poulenc
will have to divert capital from its core businesses. It will also have to
pay a premium for an interest that cannot be sold on the open market for at
least 18 months. The only logic would seem to be political: the government
wants Rhone-Poulenc as a shareholder, so it would be unwise to disappoint
it. Noyaux durs contain dangers not merely for those companies that acquire
stakes but also for ordinary investors. The risk is that a system of
interlocking shareholdings could allow French industry to huddle together
and ignore market disciplines.
The main argument for noyaux durs is that they help smooth a company's
transition from public to private sector. In particular, they stop a
newly-privatised group becoming victim of a hostile takeover - something
which could cause a political uproar. Such an argument would be fine if
noyaux durs expired after a fixed period, as is the case with the golden
shares used in the UK for similar reasons. The snag is that, if the system
allows management a comfortable life, noyaux durs could easily become a
long-term habit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's National Audit Office thinks the government's controversial sale of
its third tranche of BT shares last year was a success. Techniques devised
by merchant bank SG Warburg were effective in discouraging investors from
dumping existing stock in the run-up to the issue and so helped maximise the
sale's proceeds. The main tactic was to threaten to refuse new shares to
those who sold stock aggressively in the offer period.
A pat on the back from a happy client will certainly do Warburg no harm as
it seeks privatisation work across the world. What is difficult to
understand is why investors interviewed for last week's NAO report also
thought BT3 a success. At the time, many complained at the strong-arm
tactics used by the Treasury. They can hardly be pleased with the shares' 14
per cent underperformance since the issue.
The controversy ignited by BT3 is still live. The government is expected to
deploy similar tactics when it sells its remaining stakes in National Power
and PowerGen next year. Meanwhile, the Stock Exchange is trying to decide
whether regulations on short selling should be tightened. One idea is that
issuers should be allowed to insist on cash settlement for trades in the
run-up to an issue to make it easier to spot investors who dump shares. The
Treasury unsuccessfully lobbied for such a system during BT3. The evidence
from the NAO report is that issuers are quite capable of looking after
themselves without further help from the exchange. If anything, the playing
field is already tilted too far in their favour.

FT  31 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Funding power
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's Dollars 1.6bn Hub River power project, whose financing was
finally completed over the weekend, is being promoted as a blueprint for
first world investors eager to satisfy the developing world's appetite for
infrastructure funding. Industrial companies such as National Power, which
has a 25 per cent stake in the project, are increasingly keen to provide
some of the finance themselves. But there are competing views about how best
it should be channelled.
One route is that being taken by Welsh Water. It is looking to raise around
Dollars 100m from half a dozen industrial partners and a further Dollars
400m from institutions. The fund would provide equity for projects
identified by the industrial partners. They would get a return on their
investment as well as an outlet for their products and services. Though
attractive for the partners, such a structure raises the possibility of
conflicts of interest. Institutional backers need to be satisfied their
investment will not be used to subsidise industrial partners' sales. US
General Electric's efforts to raise Dollars 2.5bn for a fund to invest in
third world power projects are thought to have been hampered by such
concerns.
On the other hand, companies such as GE can deliver the flow of deals the
fund needs. Tiger Management, the US hedge fund, recently failed to raise
Dollars 1bn for infrastructure investment because of its perceived lack of
experience in Asia. Other institutional funds are complaining about a lack
of suitable projects. But this may say more about their expertise than the
investment opportunities.

Hizbollah, which still has an estimated 3,500 fighters dotted around
Lebanon, as well as MPs, ominously says: 'The price of peace will be greater
than that of war.'
Another Beiruti suggests: 'The Syrians are still here to protect Hizbollah,
who would otherwise be wiped out by the Lebanese army.' Meanwhile, Hizbollah
contents itself by trading shots with Israel in the south. A lasting peace?
Don't count any chickens.

With roads originally designed for 100,000 vehicles, Beirut now has at least
1m - about one per Beiruti - coughing through blitzed streets and freshly
bulldozed sites. The number of traffic lights can be counted on two hands.
'Peace brings its own problems. What would we do with traffic lights? The
troops and police would all be out of a job,' says a local driver.

Flying the flag at the reception was Maeve Fort, British ambassador. She
dashed off to a dinner for London Stock Exchange visitors, in town for a
seminar on invisibles. Fort smoothly sidestepped the question of whether the
Foreign Office regards Beirut as a hardship post.
But the presence of a very obvious bodyguard - burly type, no champagne in
hand, roving eyes - steadily maintaining three paces behind her, suggests it
does. 'Oh, pay no attention to him,' joked Fort. No need to; three steps
behind him was yet another minder.

'When my ancestors were painting themselves in woad and hitting each other
with clubs, the dawn of civilisation was taking place here.'
So said Lord Alexander Hesketh, 43, at Beirut's Coral Beach hotel,
introducing the inaugural flight of British Mediterranean Airways from
London's Heathrow to the Lebanese capital.
Chairman of BMA, Hesketh took with him an assorted bunch of hacks - Observer
included - and friends, checking out the company's leased Airbus A320 (worth
Dollars 45m) and Beirut's potential.
Hesketh is shy about BMA's shareholders; it's a private company. He says 62
per cent is British, the remainder held by backers including Italians and
Argentines. Hesketh, who also sits on the board of Babcock  - next to Lord
King, former chairman of British Airways - says BMA is no gamble, though he
adds: 'Romanticism has always been a weakness of mine.'
British Airways has just decided it too will start flying London-Beirut.
'They will try to kill us. We shall have to resist,' concludes Hesketh.

Welcome to the world's first literal emerging market. Beirut is scrabbling
to extract itself from the rubble of a 17-year war, in which a collective
madness saw as many as 200,000 killed. Not yet a tourist hot-spot, but it
might be one day.
Wealthy Lebanese and outsiders keen on risky bargains are beginning to find
Beirut sexy, if a little grim. They detect a phoenix deep within its ashes.
Some ashes. Just about the only sector in downtown Beirut - Beirut
generally, for that matter - not liberally splattered by gunfire is the
small banking enclave.
It's an odd sight; completely undamaged office blocks amid a sea of
devastation reminiscent of Berlin circa 1946. One Beiruti just back after
lengthy exile offers an explanation: 'They (the fighters) normally left the
banks alone. They all realised they needed them. No banks - no means of
funding their arms deals.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / Leading Article: EU carve-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Leon Brittan may be disappointed, yet he cannot really be surprised.
Saturday's sharing out of European Commission jobs forced Britain's senior
commissioner to relinquish responsibility for eastern Europe to his chief
rival, Mr Hans Van den Broek of the Netherlands. He is making no effort to
hide his bruised feelings.
Yet from a wider perspective, the Commission carve-up is far from a
disaster. If it is messy, it is largely because there are now too many
commissioners chasing too few jobs of substance. But Mr Jacques Santer, new
Commission president, has done a perfectly reasonable job in recasting and
dividing up the foreign policy portfolios - and, for the most part, in
concentrating fire-power on the policy areas that matter.
Moreover, before deciding whether to carry out his veiled threat to resign,
Sir Leon should reflect both on the nature of the portfolio he still
commands, and on the job he has had to drop. Trade remains the most
important aspect of the Commission's external activities, and he still faces
a formidable array of challenges, from securing implementation of the
Uruguay Round to pursuing closer relations between Europe and the dynamic
region from which it seems most remote, Asia.
Nor, in relinquishing the eastern Europe job, is Sir Leon handing over to a
protectionist or to someone determined to thwart the accession of the
central European countries to the EU. There is little doubt that Mr Van den
Broek will set about the vital task of preparing for the Union's next
enlargement with gusto. What is more, the eastern question is one for the
whole Commission, not just one commissioner. If it is to admit new members,
Brussels will have to implement changes to its budgetary, trade, agriculture
and social policies. Sir Leon will have plenty of influence in all these
areas.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Slimmer banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who would be a retail banker these days? According to Sir Brian Pitman,
chief executive of Lloyds Bank, the UK's financial services industry is
heading for a rough ride, comparable with the upheaval experienced by
manufacturing industry in the past two decades. He is right, but the
conclusions he draws, far from being melodramatic, may prove insufficiently
radical.
The new pressure on retail banking, as Sir Brian points out, comes from the
nature of the current economic recovery: in particular, from low inflation
and from growing competition. High inflation used to bail out banks from the
consequences of sloppy lending. No longer. At the same time, competition is
intensifying: with margins tightening both in the already ferocious
international wholesale markets and in domestic retail banking.
Retail banking margins were fattened during recession, when customers paid
charges demanded for fear of having facilities withdrawn. Even during
recovery, banks have chosen to rebuild margins rather than drive for market
share, despite protests about banking costs from small businesses and
personal customers.
But now, the squeeze is back on - and the longer-term picture is of further
margin erosion. Mainstream retail banks' best skill is the bread-and-butter
of deposit-taking and lending. These days, that is a commodity business.
Unless they can show that they are better at asset management, life
assurance and pensions than long-established specialists, or that they can
derive a cost advantage from their base of millions of customers when
selling such products, they have no competitive advantage in these areas.
Banks have, in fact, shown no particular skill in the provision of the newer
services. Moreover, only a small number of customers wants the full range.
Most use their banks only for the payments system, and go elsewhere when
they want loans, or other 'value-added' services. This is why Coutts, the
302-year-old private bank, may be misguided in trying to move 'upmarket' as
it announced last week. In trying to weed out customers with less than
Pounds 500,000 under management by the bank in order to focus on asset
management, it threatens to alienate its already-select customer base for
little return.
The implication of the pressures on retail banking, as Sir Brian Pitman
warned, is that job cuts are necessary. As a mature, low-growth business,
retail banks should expect numbers of employees to fall steadily as new
information and payments-handling systems are introduced. Furthermore, the
loosening of rules on building societies' lending will probably lead to
fewer banks and building societies.
While navigating this restructuring, retail banks need to ask themselves
whether they should attempt to provide a wide range of services. To survive,
they may need, instead, to cut back the 'extra' services offered to
customers and to trim further the personal service which accompanies
mainstream banking. But the banks' traditional advantage has been customer
loyalty. Somehow, they must retain that advantage, while increasing
efficiency. The risk, as they shed staff, is that standards of service will
decline and customers will go elsewhere.
The successful banks of the future will focus on core areas of advantage.
They will also become more efficient, while continuing to provide the
quality of service that sustains - even enhances - their customers' loyalty.
The rest may well decline steadily, under remorseless competition.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Personal View: 'Highway' to transport of the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES KEATING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 5 gallon of petrol is now firmly on the UK political agenda,
alongside electronic road tolls. Last year, the chancellor, Kenneth Clarke,
announced that petrol duties would rise 5 per cent a year in real terms for
the foreseeable future. In the forthcoming Budget, he is likely to go
further in raising taxes on motoring, supported by last week's report from
the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution.
The automotive age is drawing to an end, choked in its own congestion and
pollution. But what follows?
Calls for massive investment in conventional public transport, even if
privately financed, seem out of touch with the needs of a generation that
has grown accustomed to the predictability and door-to-door security of auto
travel.
Equally, visions of a nation of 'lone eagles', telecommuting from their
eyries in the countryside or suburbs, seem overdone.
The information revolution holds the key, but it is about far more than
telecommuting. Its true potential is in allowing much better use of existing
transport resources.
Off-peak buses and suburban trains usually run well below capacity, with
load factors that would make an airline bankrupt. Taxis rarely fill all
their seats, and operate at a zero load factor when plying for hire.
The new technologies can raise these utilisation rates dramatically. One
contribution would be to provide up-to-the minute information on what is
available, and make booking empty spaces easier. A more exciting
contribution would be in creating a more flexible pricing structure for
public transport.
A hint of what is to come is given by the on-line computer terminals used in
many taxis in London and other European cities. These allow cabbies to
choose a preferred job from among those offered on the screen - in most
cases, the one nearest to them at the time.
However, this offers nothing new on pricing. When you buy a taxi ride, you
get privacy, door-to-door transport and immediate service. Not everyone
wants all of these services, but they are not available separately. The only
public transport alternative is a bus or train - and these offer none of the
three.
Information technologies will allow these services to be unbundled. The
pensioner can book a cab to get (possibly shared) door-to-door service to
the supermarket, at a time chosen by the taxi company. The fare will be far
below the price charged to a business customer who needs to go at a specific
time.
The discount reflects the increase in load factors towards 100 per cent,
achieved by the flexible scheduling possible when servicing a mix of
consumers, some of whom do not mind when they travel, and some of whom don't
mind sharing. The result is a taxi service - or elements of it - at bus
prices. Mini-bus operators will join companies in these new markets.
Conventional bus services can also raise load factors by offering extra
services, such as tailoring their routes to demand. The distinction between
buses and taxis will become blurred.
This is a great vision, but it will not happen by itself. Someone has to
build communications networks to link would-be travellers with the vehicle
operators.
It might require the government to license just one or two operators for a
period to encourage investment in such networks. The question must also be
addressed of whether to have common ownership of communications networks and
of vehicle fleets, or separate them, as is planned with the split between
the owners of the track and the trains for British Rail.
These issues may seem technical now, but they could be real politics soon.
The electorate will not accept that secure, convenient transport is a
prerogative of the rich. The narrow political challenge is to set the
regulatory framework for a responsive, information-based transport system
and put the finance - public, private or mixed - in place .
But there is a broader challenge. Even if the new buses and taxis offer a
low-cost 'product', poorer people may be unable to use it if booking by
phone requires use of a credit card.
Electronic payment of social security benefits would solve this, since
claimants would gain (a limited amount of) creditworthiness by allowing
transport operators and other firms to debit their future benefits
electronically.
Political talk about 'on-ramps to the information superhighway' is easy. The
hard reality is that the information age is starting to open up a series of
very difficult issues, all closely intertwined. These will be at the core of
political debate in the next few years.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Leading Article: White House and Casablanca
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After President Bill Clinton's gestures towards peace and security during
his Middle East trip last week, the current conference in Casablanca
provides a timely reminder of the economic developments required to make
peace durable. But participants would do well to remember that the region is
far from being able to beat swords into ploughshares as the more visionary
Israeli leaders sometimes suggest. In fact, it is still in urgent search of
the political solutions that are an essential precondition for development.
The cornerstone of the peace process is the relationship between Israel and
the Palestinians, and that is in trouble. Israel has so far only withdrawn
from part of Gaza and the town of Jericho, leaving in its place an
ill-functioning Palestinian self-rule authority which has failed to get to
grips with the economic issues confronting it. Scarcely any of the Dollars
720m earmarked by international donors for infrastructure projects this year
has been spent, while Palestinian infighting has led to the absurd confusion
of the same telecommunications contract being awarded to different
companies. Israel has added substantially to the problems by shutting its
borders to tens of thousands of Palestinian workers, thereby deepening
poverty in the territories and bolstering Hamas, the radical Islamic group
intent on sabotaging the peace accord.
Israel and western aid donors agree that the modest prospects for a viable
Palestinian economy depend heavily on a close association with its Jewish
neighbour. To talk, as Israeli leaders have done recently, of a permanent
physical separation between the two communities, is a recipe for economic,
and probably political, disaster.
To avert this debacle, two things need to happen. First, Israel must
withdraw speedily from the West Bank so that already overdue Palestinian
elections can be held. If a sizeable part of the Palestinian electorate
shares western suspicions that Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation, is not up to the task of running the self-rule
authority, the sooner its voice is heard the better.
Second, the World Bank, EU and US must intensify their efforts to ensure
that donor money is spent quickly and effectively. Part of the problem here
is the lack of regional support for the aid effort.
A few years ago Saudi Arabia and Kuwait would have been expected to be among
the most generous contributors to an emerging Palestinian state and to the
regional development projects being mooted in Casablanca.
But President Saddam Hussein, the price of oil, and President Clinton's
success in selling billions of dollars worth of military equipment have
meant that even the revenues from 8m barrels of oil a day are insufficient
to halt the Saudi budget sliding into deeper deficit. With the kingdom's per
capita GNP now little more than a third of the average for the EU, what was
the world's most affluent welfare state is being rapidly eroded, and
political pressures are growing. Now Saudi Arabia and Kuwait face the need
for substantial additional outlays to support the latest US military
deployment in the region. Security in the Gulf does not come cheaply.
Enhanced security in the Middle East may be what Mr Clinton sees from the
White House. But the political obstacles remain daunting, and the economic
underpinnings for peace are fragile indeed.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Magistrates in the middle: After a run of scandals, France
is trying to prise politics and business apart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With corruption allegations having claimed two members of his cabinet,
French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is scrambling to prevent his
government being tainted with scandal in the run-up to a presidential
election that he clearly intends to contest.
Mr Balladur last week proposed a series of amendments to France's existing
political finance and anti-corruption legislation. These would subject
public procurement to closer scrutiny and leading politicians to an annual
audit of their personal wealth, as well as cut by a third the total amount
that presidential candidates could spend in the 1995 campaign for the
Elysee.
But many - including senior parliamentary figures - are calling for more
radical reforms, such as a ban on all corporate contributions to political
parties. Such proposals highlight public pressure for stronger measures
against corruption, raising questions about the extent of the problem, the
response of the political and corporate establishment, and the implications
for relations between business and state.
Most observers agree that corruption in French politics and business is not
on an Italian scale. Mr Balladur is almost certainly right in saying that
'only several tens among France's 500,000 elected politicians' are
besmirched by scandal.
But Mr Alain Carignon, his former communications minister, is now in a Lyons
prison facing charges of corruption in Grenoble, of which he is still mayor.
Mr Gerard Longuet has been forced to resign as industry minister over
allegations concerning payments for his holiday villa in St Tropez and the
funding of his Republican party. The mayor of Lyons faces investigation, and
the ex-mayor of Nice awaits extradition from South America on similar
charges.
Internationally known company chiefs have been hit. Mr Jean-Louis Beffa,
head of the Saint Gobain glass and packaging group, has been placed under
investigation in a case involving influence-trafficking, which triggered the
probes into Mr Longuet. Several executives from some utilities and
construction groups have been questioned concerning the terms on which they
secured public works contracts.
Mr Didier Pineau-Valenciennes, chairman of Schneider, the electrical
engineering group, and Mr Pierre Suard of Alcatel Alsthom, the telecoms,
transport and engineering company, have been placed under investigation in
different types of cases. The former, accused of defrauding minority
investors, is the object of an international arrest warrant issued by a
Belgian judge, while the latter faces accusations that he used company funds
to pay for work on his private property.
Much of the drive to uncover corruption has come from the French magistracy,
which has shed its former servility to political and corporate power. Its
first targets were the Socialist party's finances, the personal finances of
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the former prime minister who committed suicide 18
months ago, and the tangled affairs of Mr Bernard Tapie, the leftwing MP and
former businessman.
But the number of investigations - and the levels they reach - has risen
sharply this year, shaking government and business leaders. 'Many company
chairmen are terrified,' says Mr Elie Cohen, a Paris professor of business.
'They have seen the treatment of their counterparts and they are
traumatised.'
Business leaders have condemned the high-profile methods of the magistrates
and the lack of respect for judicial secrecy. Mr Suard, for example, was
detained for 12 hours in police custody, and claims details of the
investigation were leaked to the press.
But the spate of investigations has also prompted soul-searching about the
way business is conducted. The Patronat employers' federation has set up a
study group with a remit wider than Mr Balladur's anti-corruption
commission, to include companies' relationship to the law, judges and
politicians, as well as to examine means by which companies could exercise
better control over themselves.
Some sectors and companies are already taking their own action. The National
Federation of Public Works is working on a code binding its 6,000 member
companies not to offer bribes to win the FFr150bn (Pounds 18bn) worth of
public contracts they carry out every year. Carrefour, the supermarket
chain, has forbidden employees to accept presents worth more than FFr1,000
from suppliers. Generale des Eaux, the utilities and communications group,
has an ethics committee headed by a retired senior manager to guide managers
on sensitive contracts.
Companies are also questioning whether a tradition of powerful bosses with
inadequate internal controls has permitted malpractice. 'There is too much
concentration of power in the PDG (presidents directeurs-generaux). Stronger
boards are needed with more checks and balances,' says Mr Henri-Claude de
Bettignies, professor of ethics at Insead business school.
Pressure for reform of corporate governance in France predates the current
scandals. The legal adviser to one leading industrial group says the problem
is that 'PDGs control boards rather than vice versa'.
A 1966 reform enabling the creation of a supervisory board headed by a
president, and a directoire headed by the chief executive, would help divide
power and responsibility. However, only 2 per cent of French companies have
adopted the practice. This Anglo-Saxon type of solution does not sit easily
with French corporate culture. 'Non-executive independent directors do not
attract us,' says a one business leader.
For many observers, however, more fundamental problems lie in the close
relationship between business and state, particularly at the local level.
Scope for corruption was increased by the decentralisation of
decision-making powers to the regions over the past decade, and the trend by
cities to contract more of their water and waste treatment services to
private companies.
Half of France's 36,000 communes, representing 75 per cent of the
population, now have water provided by contractors. 'These companies have
the technology and capital required these days to carry out these services,'
says the National Association of Mayors. But there is widespread suspicion
of sweetheart deals between public officials and private companies.
Mr Balladur now proposes giving back to prefets - central government's
representatives in France's 95 departements - the power to suspend contracts
where there is ground for suspicion. A more radical proposal touted by some
would be to ban all companies carrying out public contracts from giving any
money to politicians.
A 1990 law restricts to FFr500,000 a year the amount that a company can
donate to a political party. But there is a loophole for the construction
and utility groups, since each subsidiary of a group can make donations up
to this limit. Utilities tend to set up separate subsidiaries to manage
major municipal contracts, so that Generale des Eaux, for example, has 2,500
subsidiaries.
Some say pressure for transparency is growing. 'We will move towards a
process of increased legal scrutiny of public contracts,' says Prof Cohen.
'The more affairs there are, the more momentum will grow for a system of
auctions and safeguards, such as a panel of magistrates which can oversee
contracts.'
He belives that the process is under way. The award last month of the
potentially lucrative third mobile telephone licence to Bouygues involved a
detailed analysis of rival projects and stirred a debate about the terms of
the contest. 'This kind of debate would not have happened before. It was a
significant step,' says Prof Cohen.
More steps will need to be taken. 'Even if corruption is less than before,
the popular perception is that it is rife,' admits one executive of an
industrial company. 'This is creating anti-business feeling, and has to be
resolved quickly.'

hopes', October 26) underlines the importance of the decisions currently
under consideration.
The screen may replace the school and this issue is of such technological,
educational and economic importance that we must ensure the best possible
route is taken to allow it to develop and expand.
As the report by the research organisation, Inteco, has pointed out,there
will not be appreciable revenues from this industry until the next century.
However, this cannot inhibit public and private sector expansion into the
communications revolution.
The key question is the public/private partnership; for example, can public
benefits be negotiated for UK citizens comparable with those Vice-President
Al Gore is working on in the US? In the US, Gore is operating within a
wholly private sector. Equally, in France where the public sector
predominates, the ambition is for the establishment of a network of fibre
optic cables linking every household by the year 2015.
The EU industry commissioner favours bringing the lead in development of a
European information superhighway into the domain of private companies; some
other states of the EU would prefer public operators to control national
infrastructures. Therefore the question is not one of whether private or
public sector dominates, but how both sectors can work together
constructively and create the blend which delivers the widest benefits for
the citizen.
In that positive context a future British government will try to develop
plans for information superhighways with a close eye on European and global
developments.
All excursions into the exploration of such high-tech industry must take
account of European competition and industry policies. The potential for
exciting development exists and we must ensure that Britain becomes a key
player in this new revolution and that the benefits will flow to the
greatest number of individuals.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Brussels in a banana split: A row over the EU's import
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union specifications for the bendiness of bananas have made
irresistibly comic copy on the front pages of Britain's tabloid press
recently. Most people are unable to take anything to do with bananas
seriously.
Not so a committed core of trade negotiators, officials and businessmen
involved in an acrimonious dispute over the EU's arrangements for importing
the yellow fruit.
Opposition to the EU's banana import scheme is running high. In recent
weeks, the US has launched one trade investigation and threatened a second;
the German government has complained for the second time to the European
Court of Justice; and Guatemala has vowed to lodge a complaint with the new
World Trade Organisation, successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade next year.
While disagreements over bananas date back to the creation of the EU in
1957, current divisions are so deep that the Union is finding it difficult
to agree any action at all.
The present source of friction is the preferential access to the EU banana
market - which accounts for 3.6m tonnes a year - granted to former colonies
of Britain and France in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP) under
the Lome trade convention.
In 1993, import rules had to be harmonised across member countries as part
of the move towards a single market. Before this, Germany imported bananas
from Latin America as a source of quality, uniform, inexpensive fruit. But
the new rules placed a quota and a tariff on these so-called dollar bananas,
while allowing in ACP country imports tariff-free. Under the current regime,
30 per cent of import licences are allocated to traders on the basis of past
trade in ACP bananas, 60 per cent on the basis of past trade in Latin
American bananas, and 10 per cent to newcomers and traders in EU bananas.
Germany was furious about the new rules, although, as one German former
agricultural official recently roared: 'Germans are not emotional about
bananas; it's pure economic good sense.'
Germany consumes more bananas - almost 1lb per person per week - than any
other country in the EU, double the level of UK consumption. The fruit was
seen as a first taste of freedom for west Germans after the allied blockade.
It was also a potent symbol of western affluence for east Germans, who
cleared the shelves of bananas in west Berlin when the Berlin wall was
pulled down in 1989.
'Konrad Adenauer did a lot of good things for us Germans, but the best was
the banana protocol,' said a German official with only a tinge of irony,
referring to the deal hammered out by the first German chancellor allowing
Germany to import as many bananas as it wished. Negotiating the protocol
held up the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which originally created the
European Economic Community.
Indeed, bananas have almost changed the face of the world a few times. A
Franco-German dispute over bananas delayed the signing of the Uruguay Round
agreement in Marrakesh earlier this year. And Germany's second complaint to
the European Court on the issue could still hold up EU ratification of the
Gatt deal.
The UK and France remain firmly committed to the Lome convention. 'We're
still as behind the banana regime as ever, but you can't disguise the fact
that it has rather a lot of enemies,' said one British Foreign Office
official.
UK officials, however, acknowledge that the US trade investigation could
present the most serious challenge yet to the EU's banana ar-rangements. Mr
Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, is looking into a complaint by
Chiquita Brands International, a large US banana exporter, and the Hawaii
Banana Industry Association that the EU's arrangements for importing bananas
are damaging US companies' ability to compete in the Dollars 2.7bn-a-year EU
market. Mr Kantor has said he will also investigate the quota on EU imports
from Latin America, which has been set at 2.17m tonnes this year.
Latin American countries have already had complaints over quotas upheld by
the Gatt disputes panel, which has declared the EU arrangement illegal. The
EU recently applied for a waiver to the Gatt rules for the Lome convention.
The Gatt council is due to consider the request next week.
But Mr Kantor's investigations may be more difficult to ignore. If he
concludes that US interests have been hurt by EU policy, he is likely to
threaten retaliatory trade action. If he threatens to slap a large import
tariff on Scotch whisky, for example, the UK government would have to decide
whether it could put national interests at risk through its support for an
altruistic policy towards former colonies. Under these circumstances, UK
politicians' enthusiasm for the banana regime could fade fast.
Caribbean banana producers are aware of their vulnerability in these games
of power politics, but since bananas are one of their few sources of income,
they must battle on. 'We spend all our time fighting on the diplomatic front
to preserve our markets - it's unsettling. We need stability to develop our
agriculture,' said Mr John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia, which
derives half of its gross domestic product from the sale of bananas to the
EU.
Mr Compton feels embattled on all sides, after a tropical storm in September
destroyed 60 per cent of the island's banana crop. After the storm, Geest,
the main importer of bananas from the Windward Islands, successfully fought
to raise its quota of Latin American bananas to make up the shortfall.
Germany has suggested that, since bananas from ACP countries are small and
of variable quality, their producers should receive aid to help them
diversify out of bananas. The St Lucia prime minister wants to encourage the
production of avocado pears and citrus fruit, but since most bananas are
grown by small, family farms, it takes time to put changes into practice.
For now, the European Commission is stymied on bananas. Its current rules
for quotas on Latin American bananas were due to come into force this month,
but it has been unable to agree the technicalities of the regime with member
governments. Mr Kantor's investigation is likely to take about a year, and
Germany's complaint will be heard in the European Court next year.
Anyone who thinks bananas are still amusing had better wipe the smile off
their face.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, I suggest a boost for tourism that needs no new money, no new
'initiatives', and no new government bodies. Give us intelligent, grown-up,
civilised pub hours. Let pubs open on Sunday afternoons if they want to. And
let pubs and restaurants serve alcohol until the small hours of the morning.
Michael Forsyth is the minister responsible for licensing. As a Scot, he
knows they do things better up north, where pubs can open on Sunday
afternoons and until 1am. And, as a deregulator, he should be itching to get
his hands on these absurd English laws.
How about it?

FT  31 OCT 94 / UK rates will need to rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next in the monthly round of staged conversazioni be-tween the UK
chancellor and governor of the Bank of Eng-land takes place this Wednesday.
The timing of these meetings is a bit archaic, as they are loosely linked to
the publication of the figures for M0 (cash balances) which are out today,
but which are now only one limited part of the jigsaw of indicators which
the Bank and Treasury examine.
This time, however, much light has been shed by the publication of the flash
estimate for third-quarter GDP. This estimate - for whose introduction the
Central Statistical Office should be congratulated - itself summarises a
large range of indicators. The GDP estimate was followed by the CBI
quarterly Industrial Trends survey, still the least bad forward indicator we
possess.
In a speech in the West Midlands on Thursday, the governor, Eddie George,
came as close to disclosing his advice to the chancellor as he is ever
likely to do before the event. As usual, there is something for each side.
To comfort the doves, he reminded the assembled businessmen - as he had
earlier that day reminded a financial audience in London - that 'markets are
currently exaggerating the inflationary dangers and the extent of the rise
in interest rates that might ultimately prove to be necessary to contain
them'. He detected some moderation in the output data and said that the
personal sector might be less buoyant than it was in view of the flat
housing market.
He spoke of producers absorbing cost pressures in the early stages of the
production process and of the intense retail competition, which was a
powerful ally in keeping prices down. Last, but by no means least, he
reminded people of the further fiscal tightening in the pipeline. Tobacco
and road fuel duty rise this December. In April, not only does Vat on fuel
more than double, but tax allowances for married couples and for mortgage
interest are to be trimmed, even if nothing further is announced on Budget
day on November 29.
For the hawks, he referred to the re-entry problem - that is the eventual
need to slow down the growth of output to a rate that can be sustained in
the medium term. Moreover estimates of output growth tend to be revised
upwards at this stage of the cycle. Any slowdown in consumer spending, so
far from being a bad sign, will be much needed 'if we are to find room for
stronger growth of exports and investment' of which he saw such encouraging
signs.
He was even more confident that the increase in base rates in September was
right; and said 'you wouldn't expect me then to rule out the possibility of
some further rise in interest rates at some point ahead'. For good measure
he added: 'I don't expect you to cheer exactly when rates do have to go up.
But I don't think you would thank us if we flinched . . .'
The really tell-tale bits relate to his reasons for underlying optimism,
such as the favourable outlook in overseas markets, British industrial
competitiveness, and the historically high real pre-tax returns on capital.
To a good central banker these are reasons for ensuring that things remain
that way, rather than for simple-minded applause.
As a connoisseur of Central Bank Speak, my interpretation is that Eddie
George will either ask for a moderate increase in base rates - say to 6 1/2
or 6 1/4 per cent - at this week's meeting, or prepare the ground for such a
request the following month. Further ahead I would guess that his crystal
ball cannot so far see any need for interest rates above 7 per cent -
compared with the 10 per cent over the next three years implicit in the
yield curve for bond rates.
Looking myself at the third-quarter GDP, I cannot see much sign of any
slowdown. The top chart plots a two quarterly moving average of this measure
excluding the volatile North Sea sector. It shows growth rising steadily
since the end of the recession to reach an annualised rate of 3 1/2 per
cent.
There is some argument about whether the trend rate of growth is not much
above 2 per cent per annum, as the Treasury and Bank seem to believe, or
nearly 3 per cent, as Christopher Dow, a former Bank of England economic
director, argues in the publication Leopold Joseph Economic Comments. In
either case the margin of excess capacity is being quite rapidly eroded,
which is confirmed both from the labour market figures and the CBI capacity
utilisation survey. Michael Saunders of Salomon Brothers has produced a
chart showing capacity utilisation at a normal rate in Germany, well above
normal in the US and somewhere in between in Britain.
Faithful readers will know the arguments for taking nominal spending as the
target variable for policy. Because of recent very low inflation rates,
nominal GDP growth, when we get more recent estimates, might turn out to be
at around 5 per cent per annum, perhaps even less.
In itself this is entirely satisfactory. But if there is an overwhelming
proportion of indicators pointing to upward pressures in the quarters to
come, and moreover many of them come directly from the cost and prices
component, it is time to sit up and take notice.
CBI output expectations are the highest since October 1988, towards the peak
of the last boom. Export deliveries reported are the highest since the
series began in 1978. The balance of firms in the CBI survey intending to
increase prices is now the highest since early 1991, before inflation began
its plunge. The percentage increase in earnings due to pay settlements has
edged up by around  3/4 percentage points in both manufacturing and
services. And - most difficult to take into account in policy - the
Economist commodity price index has risen, admittedly from a low point, by
over 40 per cent in the last year measured in dollars, and by over 25 per
cent measured in sterling.
This last indicator points to the radical change in the international
environment. Demand and output are rising vigorously from a varied series of
starting points in the industrial, developing and post-communist worlds
alike (apart from Japan).
The UK has no painless way of escaping completely worldwide inflationary or
deflationary forces. But every aspect of the conjuncture suggests that any
movement in sterling ought to be modestly upwards, compared with the
sideways movement of the last two years. The exchange rate must be a more
important consideration in any base rate decision than the chancellor will
find it politic to admit to his own backbenchers.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Transport - plan on basis of
sustainable development, or reverse development (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JORG SCHIMMELPFENNIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial on the findings of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution is founded on two fallacies.
First, while matching total revenue raised from any particular group of road
users with the total costs caused by that group may well relate to questions
of fairness and, thus, to selling certain policies to the public, it has
nothing to do with overall economic efficiency. For any policy to be
efficient it should set the right incentives.
Consequently, only margins are to be taken into account. As long as the
private costs of driving one additional mile fall short of the corresponding
social costs, society suffers as a whole.
Second, since the American economist, Anthony Downs, published his findings
on congestion on US freeways in 1962, there has been ample evidence - though
largely ignored by road planners and transport ministers - that new roads
increase road traffic. Again, the reason is a matter of incentives. By
relieving congestion in the short run the private costs of motoring as
experienced by the marginal driver are reduced on other roads as well and,
thus, more drivers are wrongly induced to use the roads. In the worst
scenario this may even lead to an increase in overall congestion.
Instead of proceeding with the current road building programme, the
government would be better advised to introduce road pricing and
significantly to increase fuel taxes. By pricing marginal drivers off the
roads, much of today's 'demand' for new roads would become obsolete. The
financial consequences of this could easily be cushioned by, for example,
scrapping vehicle taxes or reducing income tax or National Health Service
contributions. Taken as a whole, this could even leave public revenue
unchanged.
Every day both the countryside and tens of thousands of commuters all over
the UK continue to suffer from disastrous repercussions of Dr Beeching's
recommendations of three decades ago. The royal commission's report presents
a unique and possibly final chance to halt and, at least partially, reverse
this development. It should not be wasted.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We are sorry to find the Financial Times, of all papers, criticising
the Royal Commission's report on transport without taking the trouble to
appreciate our arguments. The commission has not said that building more
roads is 'intrinsically wrong' (as suggested by your leader, 'Misreading the
road map' on October 27). The whole basis of the report is sustainable
development, which cannot be achieved unless assessments take into account
both 'the benefits of mobility' and the value of environmental assets that
might be lost.
To carry out such assessments, the report recommends a pragmatic approach,
in the form of identifying the 'best practicable environmental option' (para
9.56). The commission's view on both roads and new rail lines (para 4.60) is
that they should not be built in areas of conservation, cultural, scenic or
amenity value unless they have been shown to represent the best practicable
environmental option. In such cases, in the terms of your leader, the price
associated with their use would have to be very high indeed before their
construction could be justified.
You also misrepresented the commission's position in another respect. The
use of unleaded petrol remains desirable on health grounds, even in cars
without catalytic converters. But we drew attention in our ninth report in
1983 to other health risks associated with high-octane (super premium)
unleaded petrol.
Neither the commission, nor so far as we are aware, other environmental
experts, has ever argued that particular grade is (as you put it) 'green'.

Of all the culture tour guides we have had on television, Jonathan Meades
has proved himself to be one of the most entertaining. He is exactly the
right person to investigate 'the unholy relics of Nazi Germany', including a
holiday camp called Prora, built for 20,000 members of the master race.
In Jerrybuilding, Meades claims it is the prototype of the 'slummy hutches'
provided today by the package tour industry (9.00 BBC2). That is part of a
sequence of programmes called Tales From Berlin which continues at 11.15
with The Country That Vanished. This comes to us asserting that for more
than 40 years East Germany 'defined itself through its writers, theatres,
architecture and visual arts'. That may be a necessary claim to justify a
Late Show special, but for most people East Germany was defined by its
sporting prowess.
White Heat, BBC2's outstanding series about technology, ends with a
programme which considers two common attitudes: techno fear and techno
fantasy - one seeing technology as the death of us and the other seeing it
as our salvation (8.00 BBC2).

FT  31 OCT 94 / Arts: The truth behind Wonderland - Jackie Wullschlager
explores the dark side of Lewis Carroll as a new play opens in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER

<TEXT>
A hundred years ago, an Oxford don asked a mother if he might photograph her
three daughters. 'What I like best of all,' he wrote, 'is to have two hours
of leisure time before me, one child to photograph and no restrictions as to
costume . . . I trust you will let me do some pictures of Janet naked (but,
if the worst comes to the worst, and you won't concede any nudities, I think
you ought to allow all three to be done in bathing drawers, to make up for
my disappointment).'
This was Lewis Carroll, a respected academic, addressing the prim wife of
another Oxford fellow. Was the famous children's writer a Victorian
innocent, or was he a 19th-century Humbert Humbert, driven by forbidden
desires, drawing the guileless into his web?
Tomorrow, Alice's Adventures Under Ground, a new play about the darker side
of the great storyteller, opens at the National Theatre. Written by
Christopher Hampton, author of the successful 1980s drama Les Liaisons
Dangereuses, and directed by the radical choreographer Martha Clarke, it is
based on intimate letters and diaries and fixes on Carroll's own dangerous
liaisons with little girls.
This is the most sensational aspect of Carroll's life. Biographers have
always fought shy of it, while passages in Carroll's diary casting light on
the troubled side of such friendships were altered or torn out after his
death. But it is an issue which not only lies at the heart of the creation
of the Alice books. It also raises topical questions about what makes adults
write children's books at all, and about how adult fantasies mould a
society's vision of childhood, and so condition children's rights and lives.
Carroll grew up in the 1830s, when the Victorian cult of childhood was
beginning to grip the nation. It was an English phenomenon - compare the
simpering innocence of Dickens's girl heroines, or Tess of the
d'Urbervilles, or Little Buttercup with their worldly European counterparts
like Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina, Carmen - and it was rooted in Victorian
repression of sex.
This made pre-sexual girls an obvious focus. Many famous Victorians fell for
them - Ruskin wrote love letters to a nine-year-old, the vicar-diarist
Francis Kilvert rhapsodised about girlish thighs and buttocks, and Lewis
Carroll was fixated with little Alice Liddell.
In our post-Freudian age, the sexual undercurrents seem blatant and these
friendships unhealthy. The truth was more ambiguous. A man like Carroll
loved children instead of women because they were safely pure and thus
sexually undemanding. He found in them a focus for emotional satisfaction
which never threatened his ideal of chastity. His love probably had
something of the sexual frisson of a schoolgirl crush; it fuelled the
imagination but was never meant to be realised.
Carroll turned his obsession into a new form of literature. For Alice
Liddell, he wrote Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and gave it to her for
Christmas 1865. It was a hit in the nursery because it was funny, amoral and
dismissive of adults. It was a hit with parents because it recreated the
lost imagination of childhood. These two features made it the first
children's classic. Its mix of subversion and nostalgia has shaped every
children's book written since.
Carroll was a stuttering bachelor mathematician whom a buttoned-up society
pushed into real eccentricity. He was thin as a stick and stiff as a poker,
he said and ate little, and listed his faults as 'indulging in sleep in the
evening'. He fled instantly from any gathering where his children's books
were mentioned, yet spent several weeks a year on the beach at Eastbourne,
carrying a supply of safety pins with which to persuade pre-pubescent girls
to hitch up their skirts and paddle in the sea.
Carroll disciplined his emotional self into non-existence, then poured his
vengeful frustration into fantasy. The Alice books, where an untouchable
little girl keeps aloof from the threats of sensuous, violent,
uncontrollable figures like the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter, depend
on a distaste for sexuality. The dream of the Wonderland garden suggests a
guilt-free Eden before the Fall.
After Carroll, these echoes began to sound through children's books and give
the genre its mythic, lasting appeal. By the 1900s Freudian undertones came
close to the surface. Peter Pan is about the triumph of a sexless boy over
the masculine, virile Captain Hook, marked by the phallic symbols of
twitching iron hook and fat cigar. Barrie, too, liked children, not women;
his marriage was unconsumated and his Neverland, where no one grows up, is
another prelapsarian wonderland. So is the riverbank of The Wind in the
Willows: Kenneth Grahame told president Roosevelt that the book was 'clean
of the clash of sex'.
By the 1950s, the cult of children was being replaced by the cult of
adolescence, but Carroll's Victorian idealisation of childhood still held
sway. A novel like Lolita is a teenage descendant of Alice in the aura of
innocence surrounding the abused heroine, in the surreal wonderland of
American highways and motels, in Nabokov's wordplay.
After the Bible and Shakespeare, Carroll is the most quoted author in
English. His letters to little girls are little-known, but their liquid flow
of emotion and badgering sentiment - 'I send you seven kisses, to last a
week'; 'Haven't I a right to be affectionate if I like?' - complement the
rigour of Alice. They suggest the link between adult fantasies and fears,
and great children's writing.
Martha Clarke has long specialised in evoking the world of fantasy, and
theatre, which can more effectively win sympathy for different perspectives,
is perhaps a better place than biography to explore this touchy side to
Carroll's story.
In Les Liaisons Dangereuses, Hampton staged a historical reconstruction
which also reflected the pleasure-seeking, 1980s me-generation. Alice's
Adventures Under Ground - Carroll's original title, rejected because it
sounded like 'a lesson book about mines' - is just right for the
self-doubting, child-obsessed politically correct 1990s. It should provoke,
as Liaisons did, literary, historical and social debate.
*Jackie Wullschlager's book 'Inventing Wonderland', about the lives of Lewis
Carroll and Kenneth Grahame, will be published by Methuen next spring.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Arts: A night off for the intellect - Opera / Romeo et
Juliette
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Writing in this paper the week before last, the Director of the Royal Opera
put up a spirited defence of the company's new Ring cycle. Among his
arguments was the need for variety in a healthy opera company, the immediate
instance at Covent Garden being the juxtaposition of that Ring with an
imminent new production of Romeo et Juliette.
The Gounod has now arrived. And different it certainly is. Whereas the Ring
set minds whirling on a wild roundabout of ideas, rousing its audiences to
cheers of enthusiasm and outraged booing, this miserably unimaginative
production of a far from probing opera gives the thinking opera-goer's
intellect the night off. To spend time and money on this Romeo et Juliette
one needs a good reason and the Royal Opera - fortunately - musters two.
They are a Romeo and a Juliet who look as if they were born to play their
roles. A wicked photo in the programme reminds us of how things used to be,
capturing Gounod's original Juliet, Marie Caroline Carvalho, looking portly
and frumpish, 'posing a problem for the corset manufacturers' as the caption
naughtily describes her. At a time when even politicians are expected to
have telegenic appeal, that is clearly no longer good enough. Today's Romeo
is the young and personable Roberto Alagna, who made such a fine impression
in La Boheme two years ago.
For a tenor born in France of Sicilian parents, this opera, combining a
passionate Italian love story with music of Gallic elegance, would seem to
be the ideal choice. Alagna declares his challenge to Tybalt with steel in
the voice, and wraps his farewell to Juliet softly in whispers. Forceful but
tender, his Romeo is a vivid personality vocally, even if his acting is
vague.
At the balcony window he is answered by the touchingly fragile, dark-eyed
Juliet of Leontina Vaduva. As we know from her previous appearances at
Covent Garden, Vaduva is a singer who paces herself carefully. This means
that the early scenes are tentatively sung, the famous Waltz Song, beloved
by Melba, barely getting into its stride. But taking Friar Laurence's potion
stimulates her to give more from there to the end - a stylish performance,
if less securely in her voice than the recent Manon.
It is fortunate that they make the balcony scene so believable, as neither
Gounod nor the production does much to help. Turning Shakespeare into opera
is work for a genius, as the only two indisputable successes (both of them
by Verdi) show.
It is almost painful to think back to the poetry that Shakespeare puts into
Romeo's mouth as he gazes up at Juliet and then compare that to Gounod's
prosaic music, which turns a literary marvel into workaday crotchets and
quavers.
Interviewed on television last week about his new opera at Glyndebourne,
Harrison Birtwistle said he did not believe in just setting a story to
music. In Romeo et Juliette, Gounod offers some memorable numbers - the two
well-known arias and the Act 4 sunrise duet - but they are purple passages
in an opera which takes simply telling the story as its highest objective.
All of Shakespeare's main characters are here. Sarah Walker manages to
suggest something of the Nurse's fussiness, though Gounod leaves little of
her character intact. Despite having to wear a tonsure that looks like a tea
cosy, Robert Lloyd has the quietly-spoken authority for Friar Laurence. Anna
Maria Panzarella makes a bright interlude of her little scene as Stephano.
Francois le Roux's Mercutio, elegant and dynamic, is in his vocal prime and
Paul Charles Clarke makes a fearsome Tybalt. The fight scenes have splendid
dash under Charles Mackerras, who remains as vivid an opera conductor in all
repertoire as ever.
As for the production, what can one say? When English National Opera put on
Romeo et Juliette they cannibalised an old set for Britten's Queen Elizabeth
I opera, Gloriana (right for Shakespeare, if not 14th-century Verona). But
even that looked better than what the Royal Opera has acquired here. A few
building blocks, miserably lit, have to serve as monastery, palace and
piazza. Whichever way one looks at them - as colour, as shape, as acting
spaces - they are devoid of imagination and atmosphere.
This non-production, by producer Nicolas Joel and designer Carlo Tommasi,
originated in Toulouse. At a time when the UK still has a trade deficit with
France, it was hardly a sensible import.
Production sponsored by Goldman Sachs. Performance continue until November

FT  31 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): ISS goes for a local clean-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISS International Service Systems, the Danish office cleaning group, has
hired a local man to head its North American division, the market leader in
the US cleaning business, writes Hilary Barnes.
Dennis Spina, 50, president and chief executive of Suburban Propane, the
second largest retail distributor of propane gas in the US, has replaced
Henrik Slipsager. Slipsager quit after he was passed over this summer in the
battle to succeed the group's veteran chief executive, Poul Andreassen, when
he retires in 1996.
Spina's arrival at ISS coincides with the Danish firm's decision to get its
shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange and raise Dollars 80m of new
capital. ISS's profits have grown rapidly over the past four years and North
America now accounts for 44 per cent of the group's revenues. Roughly 45,000
of ISS's 120,000 employees are based in North America.
Suburban Propane is part of Hanson Industries which acquired it when the UK
conglomerate took over Quantum Chemical in September 1993. Spina is being
replaced by the group's chief financial officer Salvatore Quadrino.
Quadrino, 47, will be based in Whippany, New Jersey.
William Crosby, 73, one of the grand old men of the US life insurance
industry, is stepping down after 27 years as chief executive of US Life, the
New York-based insurance company which has Dollars 132bn of life insurance
in force. Crosby, who entered the life insurance industry immediately after
he was discharged from the US Navy, started in business as an insurance
agent in Tennessee before moving to New York where he helped set up the
state's first life company.
William Simpson, 55, who was chief operating officer of Transamerica
Occidental Life before he joined US Life in 1990, takes over as chief
executive on January 1. Crosby will continue as chairman of the board and
the executive committee.

FT  31 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): No firing over Japan's smoke?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If heads are to roll because of the flop last week of the Japan Tobacco
flotation, then Jiro Saito, vice minister of the Ministry of Finance, is
vulnerable. Regarded as the ultimate ministry of finance bureaucrat - shrewd
and arrogant backed by astuteness and power - Saito is not known for
apologising, writes Emiko Terazono.
All he has said is that he regrets the way the flotation turned out.
However, that may not be enough to mollify Japanese brokers unhappy over its
handling at a time when average daily trading volume on the Tokyo stock
market remains below 300m shares. With demand for stocks still fragile, they
feared that extra supply would depress investor confidence.
Saito has also come in for criticism over the method used for pricing the
public offering. Rather than going through the 'book building' process used
in other leading financial markets, the ministry of finance offered the
stock at the mid price of a pre-offer auction. Both Japanese and foreign
brokerages felt frustrated; they could see the ministry ignoring their
claims that the flaws of the method echoed those in the last year's failed
privatisation of the East Japan Railway.
Saito says that his ministry would 'humbly listen to opinions from the
outside' about future privatisations. This sort of statement may be enough
to curb calls for his head. But if UK and North American investors had seen
the value of their investment drop by 23.5 per cent in its first day's
trading, they would not have let the man from the ministry get off so
lightly.

FT  31 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Cosmopolitan adviser at Daimler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATHARINE CAMPBELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All change at Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest company, where Edzard Reuter
steps down next May to be supplanted as chief executive by the boss of the
aerospace division Jurgen Schrempp, writes Katharine Campbell. As Schrempp
assembles his own, younger, team, the chief financial officer, 62-year-old
Gerhard Liener, moves off the board in order to become the new broom's
principal adviser on international affairs.
The assignment is not inappropriate for the man once tipped to run the
colossus himself. His role in teaching the local Swabians to think
internationally has been seminal. The product himself of a solidly
international background, Liener (below) studied extensively outside
Germany, lived in Chile in the early 1960s before he joined Daimler, and has
travelled very widely since. He is, for instance, honorary Mexican consul
for the State of Baden Wurttemberg.
The brains behind the co-operation with Mitsubishi, and fluent in English,
Spanish and French, he masterminded last year's New York Stock Exchange
listing. He is also the progenitor in the last couple of years of the
company's move towards global sourcing.
Now that Liener is relegated to an advisory role, however, who will pipe up
at board level to ensure the company continues its fight against
provincialism? Instead of looking outside, perhaps for a non-German, the
supervisory board is expected to confirm in the position Manfred Gentz, a
42-year-old lawyer who has spent his working life at Daimler in seemingly
solidly domestic jobs. While he has run Debis, the service and computer
software subsidiary, for the past four years, the company is unforthcoming
on the subject of Gentz's linguistic abilities.

FT  31 OCT 94 / People: More rooms at the Inns - As the world's biggest
hotel company continues its breakneck expansion, president Michael Leven
tells Michael Skapinker that he will match quality to quantity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Michael Leven joined Holiday Inn in 1990, he engaged the services of an
Atlanta-based British woman who teaches Americans how to deal with UK
companies.
Holiday Inn had recently been taken over by Bass, the UK brewer, and Leven,
who grew up in Boston, was worried about committing some indiscretion.
'Americans are scared to death of doing the wrong thing,' he says.
His memories of what the consultant taught him are hazy. But whatever it
was, it seems to have worked. Earlier this month, Leven, 56, was promoted
from head of the Americas division to president and chief operating officer
of Holiday Inn Worldwide, giving him responsibility for the day-to-day
running of the world's biggest hotel company.
Over the past two years, Holiday Inn, which has more than 1,900 hotels, has
been opening new properties at the rate of one every two days. It plans to
have 3,000 by the end of 1998.
Much of the expansion will be abroad. Hotels outside the Americas currently
provide Holiday Inn with 10 per cent of its profits, but Leven wants to see
that rise to 33 per cent over the next four years.
His anxiety about running an international, UK-owned business has
disappeared, although he has made some adjustments to style. One of the
things he does remember his consultant telling him was that UK companies
were more formal than American ones.
'She said that I had to remember that most British business people think
that Americans shoot from the hip. She was right. That was very helpful.
When I wanted to do something I made sure I had all the documentation.'
Leven says Bass has become less formal in the four years he has been there.
In the beginning, however, he was struck by the manner in which Bryan
Langton, Holiday Inn's British chairman and chief executive, conducted
meetings.
Langton began by noting the apologies, a procedure which was new to Leven.
He says: 'In the States, if a guy doesn't show up, he doesn't show up.'
Other than that, he thinks the problems of working across national
boundaries have been exaggerated. 'People have made doing business
internationally into a mystique. It's easy when things aren't going right to
make the excuse that it's because the people are different. Oftentimes,
things don't go right when people aren't different.'
Everyone, he says, has been asking how he and Langton, who remains chairman
and chief executive, are going to divide duties between them. Bass says
Langton, 57, will focus on strategic issues, while Leven takes
responsibility for hotel operations and sales.
Leven says that companies often want their two top executives to have
different skills: for one to be strong in finance, for example, and the
other in marketing. In the case of Langton and Leven this is not so.
They have similar backgrounds having specialised in the operational side of
the business. And their personalities are not dissimilar; both are
accomplished raconteurs.
Leven says: 'It's not the usual balance between the chief executive officer
and the chief operating officer. But the real advantage I have working with
Bryan is that he understands Bass and how to move through it.'
Before joining Holiday Inn, Leven spent five years as president of the US
chain Days Inn. He has spent his entire working life in the hotel industry,
except for nine months in the late 1960s when he was employed at the
Practising Law Institute in New York.
His job there was to make hotel bookings for the institute's meetings. He
was appalled by what he saw. 'I got to understand what a hotel was like from
the customer's point of view. I learned how badly customers were treated.'
Leven has also had a taste of life as a Holiday Inn franchise holder. While
he was working as head of operations for a company which ran a Holiday Inn
under a franchise agreement, there was a disagreement on how much to spend
on refurbishing a hotel. Leven suffered the indignity of being thrown out of
the system.
It is something he has done to many other hotel owners since. The company
only owns about 10 per cent of the hotels that carry its name. The rest are
run by franchise-holders. Bass found that many were run down, particularly
in the US, and that the Holiday Inn name had been badly damaged as a result.
Veterans in the company found it difficult to accept that this had happened.
Holiday Inn had been launched in 1952 with the specific intention of
providing travellers with a guaranteed level of quality and no unpleasant
surprises. Kemmons Wilson, its founder, built the first Holiday Inn in
Memphis, Tennessee, after deciding that there had to be something better
than the appalling hotels he had encountered on his travels round the US.
Langton moved the company's headquarters from Memphis to Atlanta and cut
headquarters staff from 2,450 to 1,000.
Leven's first job at Holiday Inn was to raise the franchised hotels'
standards. It is a task he says is not yet complete. 'I am not happy with a
piece of the chain where the quality and service standards are still behind
what they should be,' he says.
Leven estimates that about 15 per cent of Holiday Inns in the Americas still
have unsatisfactory standards. He would be happier if the figure fell to 5
per cent - which he says should happen by the beginning of 1997.
He insists, however, that much has been done to rescue the name since the
Bass takeover. Of the 1,600 Holiday Inns in the Americas, almost 1,000 have
been fully refurbished.
But how will Holiday Inn maintain standards if it expands as rapidly as it
says it will? Over the past two years, the company has signed joint venture
agreements with local partners to open 30 hotels in Indonesia, 47 in
Thailand, 70 in India and 11 in Nepal.
It will also manage two luxury cruise ships in China. Over the next five
years, franchisees and joint venture partners will build 60 hotels in
Europe. Leven says: 'We don't have quality problems with the hotels we open.
It's the older ones that have problems.'
The question that intrigues analysts in the leisure industry is whether, if
the expansion goes smoothly, Leven's reward will be the chairmanship when
Langton retires.
But the difficulty here is that executive directors on the Bass board have
to leave at 60; though US Holiday Inn employees can continue until 65, Leven
is only a year younger than Langton and would be near the board age limit
when Langton retires.
Bass insists that nothing should be read into Leven's promotion except that
he has a job to do. Leven concedes that if he fails to meet Holiday Inn's
targets, that sort of conjecture would be irrelevant anyway.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Media Futures: US cable groups push into telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US cable companies are resisting the Federal Communication Commission's
(FCC) ruling allowing local telephone groups into the cable business, by
mounting their own bids to break into telecommunications.
Last week, cable group Time Warner applied for state permission to enter the
local telephone business in Ohio. A day earlier, TCI, Cox and Comcast
announced the formation of a joint venture with long-distance carrier Sprint
to offer local and long-distance services, wireless communications and cable
in a single package to consumers.
These forays will eventually result in the complete breakdown of barriers
between the two industries, analysts predict. 'In the long-term, cable will
compete with the local exchanges and vice-versa,' says Berge Ayvazian,
senior vice-president of Yankee Group. 'These companies are wise to position
themselves to act quickly once the barriers come down.'
Earlier this month, the FCC's 'video dial tone' ruling paved the way for
local telephone companies to build the infrastructure for cable services.
Long-distance providers like AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI do not benefit from the
ruling, since they do not provide wiring to houses and businesses.
However, the ruling did impose restrictions on local telephone groups'
adventures in cable. Although the companies are allowed to establish
facilities for video signals, they are so far forbidden from sending videos
down those lines. Even so, the ruling was enough to rile the cable and
long-distance sectors.
'It's very possible that local telephone customers will end up paying higher
rates to finance a new video infrastructure', says Lisa Meredith,
spokesperson for the National Cable Association. But the FCC and local
telephone groups insist federal and state scrutiny of rates will prevent
this from happening.
The Rochester telephone company, re-named Frontier earlier this year, will
soon become the first to face competition in its market. In January, Time
Warner will offer residents in the up-state New York region an alternative
service. The success of that experiment will probably help determine the
speed with which cable companies gain access to other areas. Most states now
guarantee a monopoly for the Baby Bell groups which split off from AT&amp;T in
the 1980s.
Cable wires are generally set up to send one-way signals to households, and
are not easily adaptable to two-way telephone signals. Time Warner will try
to resolve the problem in Rochester by putting a telephone box to convert
the signals next to the cable box in customers' homes. The new Sprint, TCI,
Cox and Comcast venture will try a more direct route, aiming to provide a
wireless service to consumers.
The sudden burst of activity in the cable-telephone cross-over has sparked
renewed calls for sweeping Congressional legislation. 'This cannot and
should not be settled on a case-by-case basis, depending on what individual
states decide,' says Donna Lampert, special counsel for legislation and
policy at the FCC. 'We need comprehensive federal legislation.'
The FCC, for its part, can only interpret existing laws governing the
sector. A nearly successful push for a telephone-cable bill was squashed by
the local telephone companies earlier this year and observers are sceptical
that the 1995 Congressional session will produce any new legislation on the
issue. Meantime, telephone and cable companies will continue to test the
limits of their involvement in each other's business.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Where Packard Bell has the PC edge - Why the
Californian company has been so successful in the multimedia revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the battle between International Business Machines and Compaq for
leadership of the personal computer business has been hogging the limelight,
a hitherto little - known player is threatening to upstage the giants of the
multimedia industry.
Packard Bell Electronics, a privately-held Californian PC manufacturer which
sells exclusively to home users through retail outlets, crept past IBM in
the first six months of this year to take third place, after Compaq and
Apple Computer, in the US PC market, and is now fourth  - after Compaq,
Apple and IBM - in the worldwide market. Its projected 1994 sales are
Dollars 2.5bn and should be close to Dollars 3bn next year, says Beny
Alagem, its chief executive.
The significance of that rate of progress should not be under-estimated.
Compaq, Apple and IBM are the 'premier league' PC makers, pioneers of the
industry and owners of the most prestigious brand names in the business. But
who goes out purposely to buy a Packard Bell?
Packard Bell Electronics was founded in 1926 as a radio manufacturer and has
no connection to Hewlett Packard, the US electronics giant, or to the Bell
telecommunications companies. Nevertheless, it seems to have got two
elements of the multimedia revolution right.
First, multimedia services are likely to be delivered to the home through
PCs rather than TV sets. A report this week on multimedia in European homes
from the research company Inteco notes: 'One of the most striking
conclusions to be thrown up is that the PC rather than the TV set will be
the likely focus for multimedia services in the home. . . a whole range of
multimedia-related equipment and activities are concentrated in the same
type of households, and PC buying is concentrated in these same busy
households.'
This year, as many computers will be sold for use in the home in the US as
for use in business. Packard Bell has a 41 per cent share of mass retail
sales in the US, ahead of IBM (13 per cent) and Apple (9 per cent). The
implication is that in the US, at any rate, multimedia services are more
likely than not to be delivered to the home on Packard Bell machines.
The company's own corporate goals include 'making the PC the centrepiece of
the home', 'implementing the most efficient manufacturing model in the
industry so every one can afford a PC' and 'having at least one Packard Bell
PC in every home'.
Second, ease of use and maintenance is a critical factor in the home market.
Even IBM has been forced to this conclusion. 'The PC industry has done a
brilliant job of innovation and technology,' said G Richard Thoman, head of
IBM's PC operations, last month, when introducing a new, simplified PC
range. 'But in the process we have lost touch with the majority of customers
who are all dazed and confused by the complexity in the technology, the
array of choices, and the level of support.'
Packard Bell claims to have been the first manufacturer to sell systems
complete with a hard disc and pre-loaded software, and the first
manufacturer to build in a CD-Rom drive, creating a multimedia packaged
system. It also claims to be the first PC manufacturer to introduce on-site
maintenance to the home.
It calls its latest family of systems 'home appliances'. Packaged in a
single cabinet is a multimedia PC which doubles as a compact disc player, a
stereo system, a TV and video player, a telephone-answering system and
facsimile machine, complete with modem for attachment to the telephone
network. All this for between Pounds 1,499 and Pounds 1,999.
The Packard Bell machines are designed to look good in the home. But more
important is Navigator software developed by Packard Bell to make using its
computers easier. Navigator is based on pictures and operates by interacting
with Windows, Microsoft's graphical interface. Beny Alagem makes it clear,
however, that although users need never go into Windows, Navigator is not a
replacement for the Microsoft product.
There are various ways to use Navigator. One method starts with a view of a
hallway with rooms leading off it. As the cursor is passed over the
doorways, the rooms are illuminated as if a light has been turned on. The
rooms represent the learning centre full of tutorials and demonstrations;
the workspace, a management system for applications and documents; a
software area for all the programs available; and a suite of games called
Kidspace. Next year the company will offer special software that makes it
simple for home users to log on to the Internet, the world's largest
computer network.
Before its leap into the top tier of PC makers, Packard Bell attracted
attention through a deal last year with Groupe Bull, the French
government-owned computer manufacturer struggling to return to profitability
after several years of losses. The French company took a 20 per cent stake
in Packard Bell to seal an accord through which the US company would have
access to Bull's PC technology, while Bull would have the benefit of Packard
Bell's experience in selling in volume through low-cost retail channels
(Groupe Bull's PC arm, Zenith Data Systems, was a pioneer in portable
computing).
According to Alagem, the relationship is working well. The company is
opening a new manufacturing facility at Angers in France, where Bull makes
printed circuit boards and other PC components.
Nobody can say with certainty that Packard Bell's future is assured. Many
companies in the PC business have experienced false dawns. And the home
market is quirky and unpredictable. But what Packard Bell has achieved so
far suggests that as multimedia expands into the home, a Packard Bell
machine is likely to be at the end of the information superhighway.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Architecture: David and the car goliath - Colin Amery
outlines Florentine designs for a second renaissance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I think of Florence, I still think of the Flood. On November 4, 1966
the River Arno burst its banks and threatened - indeed destroyed - some of
the finest art treasures and buildings of the Italian Renaissance.
In recent years Florence has been threatened and damaged by less obvious but
equally damaging floods, those of cars and tourists. Any summer visitor to
the city will know that it is now impossible to see through the barricade of
back-packs and shorts to the pictures on the walls of the Uffizi gallery. It
is impossible to penetrate the city centre by car during the day, and there
is no chance of a photograph of a Florentine architectural masterpiece
without a foreground of massed cars.
However, in London at present you can see exactly what the authorities of
Florence are planning to do for their troubled city in the next decade.
Their plans are on show at the Italian Institute in Belgrave Square until
November 25 (Mondays to Fridays, 10am-5pm).
The problems of Florence are common to many historic towns and cities of
Europe, and it seems fitting to look to the city that produced Dante,
Giotto, Michelangelo, Leonardo, Galileo and Brunelleschi to see if it can
now produce the right answers for the 21st century.
For a start there is honesty in the admission of the Florentine authorities
that the last 30 years have been ones of inactivity, indecision and
internecine fighting between the city centre, the shopkeepers, the hotel
owners and the ill-planned suburbs. This constant struggle has been
enlivened by the daily arrival of 80,000 cars, as well as the annual arrival
of 7m tourists.
When he spoke in London last week, Alfredo Franchini, Florence's councillor
for urban planning, announced the city's approval of a completely new
master-plan, produced by Marcello Vittorini. Franchini showed a touching
faith in rationalism and in planning itself. But it is important to realise
that the master-plan is not a ruthless grid of geometry thrown over a dying
city. In fact, studied carefully, the Vittorini plan is a gentle adoption of
many of the qualities that have made cities work in the past.
He appears to believe, thank heaven, in the value of mixed development.
All the best cities in the world are an effective mix of homes, workplaces
and cultural and leisure activities. The idea of strict zoning has long been
discredited.
Urban qualities are hard to define, but we recognise them when we see them.
With its remarkable skyline and carefully controlled scale within the
surrounding hills, the centre of Florence both works and is beautiful.
But it has a declining population. Only 400,000 people live in the centre,
and the prediction is that numbers will continue to decline. The problem is
to make historic centres attractive to residents as well as to tourists.
Two important influences are already changing Florence, and there are vital
lessons here for London and other declining cities. Alarm at the level of
atmospheric pollution forced the passing of a law to ban cars that are not
fitted with catalytic converters or carrying fewer than three people from
the city centre. Second, realising the inevitability of some cars, Florence
has embarked on the expensive but necessary provision of underground car
parks.
The most significant changes in the city are likely to be in an area largely
owned by Fiat, known as Novoli, to the north-west of the historic centre.
Under the master-plan it is proposed to devolve many of the city's essential
services - town halls, libraries, smaller museums, banks and sports centres
 -to five new 'boroughs'. Novoli will be one of these, and the fact that a
large part of it is in the single ownership of Fiat - it was once a large
components factory - has eased the planning process.
The Fiat-Novoli plan has been prepared by the influential urbanist Leon
Krier, who has planned a large area, about 1,000 acres, dividing it into 14
urban sections. Each of these sections will feature a rich mixture of uses,
and will regenerate in an imaginative way the run-down high-rise housing and
demolish much of the disastrous detritus of the 1960s.
As the centrepiece of the redevelopment, the plans show a 30-acre park and
some 90 acres of new buildings. Wisely it includes major new public
buildings for the university and the courts of justice.
Krier's work for Florence, which the city authorities believe has a touch of
genius about it, revives the architectural and planning traditions of
Florence, for each of the 14 sections will have a central piazza. The ground
and first floors of all new buildings will be given over to shops and
commercial uses, and residential premises will be on the upper floors.
Comprehensive building codes set out the guidelines for the city. No
ordinary buildings should be higher than four storeys, and the use of stone
is to be encouraged for the ground floors and for the entire facades of the
more monumental public buildings. Fiat is an enlightened client, and it has
instructed the Turin-based architects Gabetti and Isola to turn the plan and
the codes into real buildings.
There is a sense of excitement and creativity about these plans, and they
have won international support. If they are followed comprehensively there
is a real chance that Florence will achieve a second renaissance that will
make it a city for the 21st century that respects its finest architectural
traditions. Once again Florence has become a city to watch.
The Accademia Italiana has organised a public conference on the Florence
plan in London on November 23. Tickets and details, tel: 071-235 0303.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Media Futures: SRI denounces superhighway claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SRI International, one of the world's largest research institutes, has
denounced the information superhighway as a myth created by media hyperbole,
and as too vague and ill-defined a concept on which to make investments.
The sceptical note comes at the end of a Dollars 1.4m, two-year study
programme, and as SRI - formerly the Stanford Research Institute - embarks
on a further two-year research programme on digital-video-multimedia.
SRI is also increasingly sceptical about the idea of a significant degree of
convergence between the main communication industries, although several
major industries are becoming closer through alliances and involvement in
each other's markets.
'The notion that the computer, TV, video-game and telecoms industries are
likely to merge into one gigantic full-service entity has no support, and
much evidence to suggest that the industries will continue to remain
separate,' SRI says.
The organisation, which over the next two years plans large reports on
company strategies in the emerging interactive-media and digital-media
markets, the latest technology trials, new media business models and market
prospects, warns that consumer acceptance and demand for the new services is
'highly speculative'. It believes that, though the potential for change in
digital video technology is vast, the rate of change for most applications
will be much slower than expected. The problems range from the fact that
most of the required infrastructure will not be in place before the end of
the decade, a lack of agreed standards and that the cost of the technology's
initial deployment remains too high.
'A good example is desk-top video-conferencing. The value added to most
users in increased productivity is not great enough to warrant spending
approximately Dollars 3,000 per desk-top,' SRI argues.
More than 50 large corporations, ranging from IBM and Sony to Microsoft and
Siemans, are sponsoring the SRI research project. With the exception of
areas such as education and video games, SRI believes there will be no
stampede in the direction of interactivity, and that watching video
entertainment will remain a mostly passive activity.
New services will also not only face competition against each other but with
existing media. In the face of advanced pay-per-view services and
video-on-demand, video rental stores will not disappear 'quietly, or
quickly' but will probably lower their prices and compete fiercely.
SRI sees 'packaged media' in the form of CD-Rom-based video games and video
information products at the forefront of emerging new markets. Video CD will
also, SRI believes, attain modest success during the next three years, but
it will not reach the critical mass in consumer markets necessary to elevate
it to the same levels as CD audio or VHS video.
The SRI Digital Video Multimedia programme costs Pounds 23,000 to sponsor
for two years, including seminars and consultancy. SRI International Europe

FT  31 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Revival of a ghost town - The
reconstruction of Beirut is under way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years in the wilderness, Lebanon is starting to put itself back on the
map, and it would like the world to notice. This will not be easy. From 1975
to 1990 Lebanon was racked by a civil war involving an array of religious
sects and interested neighbours; 200,000 or so people died and 1m fled
abroad. And foreigners were targeted: Terry Waite was the best known of many
hostages.
The war was not won. It just wound down. But the shooting stopped and the
hostages went free. A comprehensive Middle East settlement remains in the
future, but Beirut is a city at peace, with much reconstruction to be done.
A Dollars 1.8bn company called Solidere was floated this year to rebuild
downtown Beirut. It has raised some 95 per cent of its capital from Lebanese
at home and abroad, though foreign groups have taken a big share of the
contracts. Americans, however, are restrained by a state department ban on
Beirut airport.
In the meantime, the core of Beirut is an eerie place. Several blocks near
the Place des Martyrs and the Green Line, which divided east and west
Beirut, have been cordoned off from traffic. Squatters have been thrown out.
The streets are lined with elegant stone buildings. Though windows and
shop-fronts have been blasted away and walls pockmarked by sniper fire, the
fabric is sound, for the area was spared the heavy shelling that devastated
other parts of town.
Solidere has pulled down 300 of the most damaged buildings - far too many,
say critics of its mega-plans to provide marinas, reconstruct vanished souks
and create a residential 'Levantine village'. Next comes a three-year
rebuild-ing of the infrastructure. After that, the remaining buildings will
be restored and the inner city brought back to life. Until then, the
authorities hope the area will prove a tourist attraction - morbid perhaps,
but an authentic modern ghost town.
Beyond the downtown area, Beirut is alive and bustling, though there are
armed groups of soldiers and military police everywhere, some in tanks. It
is by no means clear what they are for, and foreigners may feel that their
presence makes the city look more of a militarised zone than it really is.
Out in the countryside we heard a rattle of gunfire. 'Shooting birds,' said
our guide firmly. 'Wedding celebrations,' said someone else's guide, equally
firmly. Whatever it was, it wasn't war. Many of the soldiers are Syrian
peacekeepers, and there are more images of Syria's President Hafez al-Assad
than of Lebanon's own leaders.
At ground level, Beirut - once known for its Riviera-like beauty - is dusty.
From the mountains, it looks appallingly polluted, swathed in a dense brown
cloud. The main reason is cars: one 'statistic' we were given was that there
were five for every household. Real postwar Lebanese statistics are almost
non-existent, but public transport was one of the institutions wiped out.
Everyone drives (hair-raisingly badly) and jams are common. Taxis are cheap,
however, and drivers, like everyone else, are happy to charge in US dollars.
Solidere's plans call for the construction of big hotels in town and the
restoration of old ones such as the St George's, now a seafront ruin.
Meanwhile, there are a dozen or so comfortable upmarket places that offer
reasonably prompt telecommunication services. The best are said to be the
Coral Beach and Summerland on the water-front, starting at around Dollars
160 a night.
Most international cuisines are represented in Beirut, though the most
enjoyable is Lebanon's own, based on mezze - 20 or more small dishes of
different dips, snacks and starters. After dark, some establishments lure
customers with 'top Bulgarian strip-girls', but those of us who tried clubs
found only so-so discos and belly-dancers.
Beirutis themselves seem to spend the evenings ambling along the corniche,
chatting and drinking coffee.
Dress codes are unrestrictive (men should wear ties for business meetings,
which are apt to start slightly late), and the currency is all in paper,
with about LPounds 1,660 to the dollar. Bargaining is widespread.
If you have a spare day, try a trip to Baalbek, 50 miles inland in the lush
Bekaa valley, which has magnificent Roman ruins. Those with more time may
like to visit the ruins in the 9,000-year-old city of Byblos, the
19th-century palace of Beit Eddine, or the forest of Lebanese cedars at
Bsherri near Tripoli.
A new airline, British Mediterranean Airways, has started direct flights
from London to Beirut five days a week (not Wednesday or Sunday), with
return fares from Pounds 399. It joins the thrice-weekly service of Middle
East Airlines. Be warned: formalities at Beirut airport can be
time-consuming.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Frankfurt terminal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frankfurt airport, Europe's number one cargo hub and second only to London
Heathrow in passenger numbers, opened its new Terminal 2 last week.  It
hopes to siphon traffic away from crowded Heathrow.  'We're expecting around
4m to 5m passengers through Terminal 2 next year,' a spokesman said.  'It
can handle 12m passengers, and can be expanded.'
Frankfurt is readying to attract more international passenger and cargo
flights as Heathrow and Gatwick, London's other main airport, near
saturation.  Lufthansa, Germany's national airline, will occupy half of
Frankfurt's Terminal 1 together with about 90 minor airlines.  About DM500m
has been spent updating Lufthansa's facilities, which will also be used by
its partners, Thai Airways and United Airlines.
Around 20 international airlines including British Airways, Delta Airlines,
Deutsche BA, Japan Airlines and Air France, will move to the new terminal,
which will be connected to Terminal 1 via an automatic overhead railway
similar to Gatwick's.
Frankfurt has also spent large sums on an underground baggage-handling
system.

Visitors hoping for a closer look at the Acropolis in Athens were
disappointed yesterday after an unemployed man threatened to commit suicide.
 The Acropolis has been closed since October 5 because of a guards' strike.
The culture ministry guards, who want higher pay, decided on Friday to open
the site for three days after a court ruled their walkout was illegal.  They
will consider today whether to resume their strike. But police sealed off
the monument after a man scaled scaffolding and threatened to jump.

Overcrowding, breakdowns and a shortage of funds have turned rail commuting
in and around Bombay into a daily nightmare.  The 2,000 trains on Bombay's
suburban network trundle nearly 5m people to work each day.  Frustration has
turned to violence five times in the past four months, with commuters
wrecking property.
The authorities plan to use longer trains and phase out level-crossings. But
raising funds will be difficult.  'We may have to consider approaching the
European markets, through the finance ministry, for cheaper funds,' said an

In Hong Kong, a daily 10-minute traffic jam could be costing the British
colony huge sums, Hang Seng Bank has calculated.  'If the time spent in
traffic congestion (were) put to productive use, a 10-minute daily delay for
each worker would equal 124m working hours for the whole economy,' it said.
 Translated into money terms, this would imply an additional output of
HKDollars 18bn (Dollars 2.3bn).
Traffic conditions have deteriorated sharply in Hong Kong, with car
ownership outstripping road construction.  And rapid expansion of trade with
China has boosted freight and passenger movements across the border.

Bridges fall apart. Boats catch fire. Aircraft crash. Trains collide.
Ferries capsize. The past year in South Korea has been bad enough to make
any traveller nervous. But the frequency of disasters during 'Visit Korea
Year' is especially grim news, writes our Travel Staff.
The collapse of one of Seoul's main river bridges, the Songsu, during the
morning rush hour on October 21 killed at least 32 people and cast a shadow
over South Korea's reputation as a world leader in construction.
As the embarrassed government expressed contrition for lax safety
procedures, a pleasure boat packed with local tourists caught fire on
Chungju Lake south of Seoul three days later, killing at least 25.
Yet the combined toll from these two accidents pales in comparison with the
numbers killed on the roads during an average long holiday weekend.
The latest accidents have reinforced a widespread impression that travelling
anywhere in South Korea - by any type of transport - is exceptionally
dangerous.
Ask Yoo O-kun, a bank employee who went to Chungju Lake to recover from the
Songsu Bridge nightmare - he lost his closest friend - and ended up helping
to rescue people from the burning boat.
'I now reckon there's no safe place in our country,' he said. 'How could
disasters take place in succession like this? I'm too scared to travel now.'
The boat disaster happened just over a year after a ferry capsized off the
west coast, killing 292.
Those who think that train or air travel might be more reassuring are wrong.
In August, 160 passengers and crew aboard a Korean Air Lines Airbus had a
remarkable escape when it crash-landed in a rainstorm on the southern
tourist island of Cheju.
In July last year, 64 were killed when an Asiana Airlines Boeing crashed on
the south-west coast. And air force chief General Cho Kun-hae was among six
people killed when a helicopter crashed south of Seoul last March.
Two months ago, three were killed and 50 hurt when two express trains
collided head on. A driver had ignored a signal. Last March, 79 were killed
in a train accident in the southern city of Pusan.
Observers blame lax safety standards, non-enforcement of regulations - and
corruption - for many accidents in South Korea.
Korea plans to spend Dollars 100bn (Pounds 67bn) on infrastructure over the
next eight years. However, MPs, the media and engineers warn of more bad
accidents to come. The lesson is clear: in South Korea, it is always better
to arrive than to travel.

Verbal tics and visual trickery now dominate TV news bulletins, and Allison
Pearson aims a few kicks below the console desk in Without Walls (Tuesday,
9.00-9.30pm, C4) - a powerful polemic that takes the genre to task for being
'splendidly idiotic' in its mannerisms. She also accuses it of political
bias, parochialism, sexism and a tendency towards tabloidism. Thank God
Reginald Bosanquet, the famed ITV newscaster, isn't alive to see this.
Phillip Larkin was wrong: sex did not arrive in Britain between the trial of
Lady Chatterley and the Beatles' first LP. A new series, Forbidden Britain
(Thursday, 9.45-10.30pm, BBC2), examines what remained unspoken until
recently. It includes interviews with a woman who was considered a criminal
because she had sex before the age of consent. And memories of the second
world war as a time when Britons pulled together are belied by figures
showing that between 1939 and 1941, crime against children and young people
rose by half. Eye-opening stuff.
There could be a sense of deja vu in Harry Enfield and Chums (Friday,
9.30-10.00pm, BBC1). If you think you have seen many of the characters - you
have. His sidekick, Paul Whitehouse, has just finished his first comedy
series, which owes a debt to Enfield's comic personae. However, there are
plenty of new characters, including the Self-Righteous Brothers, who can
solve all problems from the comfort of a bar stool, and Brian Bewildered,
who can't tie a shoelace without getting confused over the ins and outs.
Watch for Merchant-Ivory's Terminator III.
There is a touch of opportunism in the casting of Juliet Aubrey as Isabella
in one of Shakespeare's most problematic plays, Measure For Measure
(Saturday, 9.30-11.20pm, BBC2). Having made Dorothea Brooke, the most
priggish heroine in English literature, seem sympathetic, Aubrey may well
prove a success as Shakespeare's morally riven nun, a part which has
defeated many a more experienced actress. The popularity of Aubrey's
performance in Middlemarch should help draw viewers.

It is Halloween, and the deadly double genitives are back. Tearing off
syntactical bandaging, the movies and their titles rise from the laboratory
table.
Two years ago we had to grapple with 'Francis Coppola's Bram Stoker's
Dracula'. Now it is 'Kenneth Branagh's Mary Shelley's Frankenstein'. The new
movie opens the London Film Festival this Thursday and crashes on to public
screens the next day.
Since Universal Pictures still owns the one-word titles for the two great
Gothic classics, everyone else has to think up these rolling-stock monikers.
But the Columbia-Branagh Frankenstein, we hear, is fiercer and pithier than
its title. And there is much to look forward to in an acting showdown
between our classical Ken, playing Frankenstein, and America's method
master, Robert De Niro, playing the creature. I shall review the film (still
under wraps from critics) next Thursday.
London's movie epicentre is the Barbican. Their season, just beginning,
boasts everything from Orson Welles' Macbeth to Peter Greenaway's Prospero's
Books via James Cagney in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Grigori Kosintsev's
Hamlet, and - strangest and rarest of all - a 1920s German 'trousers role'
version of Hamlet, starring Asta Nielsen.
On the video trail this week: a second chance to be carried away by
transvestism. In Mrs Doubtfire, Home Alone director Chris Columbus teams up
with American motormouth Robin Williams in the funny tale of a
cross-dressing nanny. For more traditional tastes there is what the
double-possessive movie-title trend would call 'Alan J Pakula's John
Grisham's The Pelican Brief'. The director of Klute meets the best-selling
thriller novelist, guaranteeing frissons in this Florida-set conspiracy
tale, starring Julia Roberts.
Best of all on video is The Piano. What do we call this if we want to give
it double proprietorship? It would have to be Jane Campion's Jane Campion's
The Piano. She wrote and she directed. And she turns the mid-19th century
New Zealand bush into a violently beautiful setting for a mute heroine
(Oscar-winning Holly Hunter) and her baptism in a new emotional world.
Marvellous.

The muses of two very different generations of rock music release new albums
this week: Joni Mitchell's Turbulent Indigo (Reprise) is characteristically
serious and moralistic, but always intelligent. Sadly, however, Mitchell
seems to have mislaid her sense of fun temporarily. An idea of her mood can
be gleaned from the cover, on which her face is transposed on to a Van Gogh
self-portrait. About a million miles from the sensibility of this
well-crafted album is Madonna's Bedtime Stories (Maverick/Sire), in which
our heroine goes soft and gooey after years of abrasively flaunting her
sexuality before us. Without wishing to sound like an old woman, it simply
doesn't work; most depressing of all is the lack of attention to the quality
of her songs, which actually used to be one of her strong points.
Christmas compilation fever is already beginning to break out in the shops.
It is hard to imagine that there is a new way of packaging Motown's peerless
collection of classics, but Motown - The Ultimate Hits Collection claims to
have remastered 46 tracks (41 of them Top Ten UK hits), from Mary Wells to
Boyz II Men, for our rediscovery. I'm afraid I still prefer the scratchy
singles. INXS - The Greatest Hits (Mercury) celebrates the band's 17 years
with a resume of their best-known material.
Russian spirituality seems to be going down a treat in the faithless west
these days. Latest releases in a growing genre are Rachmaninov's Vespers
(Philips), featuring Nikolai Korniev conducting the St Petersburg Chamber
Choir (they are midway through a European tour), and Night Vigil (Deutsche
Grammophon), a live recording of the Russian Orthodox Palm Sunday all-night
service from the Cathedral of the Transfiguration in St Petersburg. Staying
with that city, Sony Classical have released nine new recordings in their St
Petersburg Classics series, which is dedicated to rediscovering the music
and the artists of the former Soviet Union. Among the releases are
symphonies by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, and Shostakovich's moving chamber
symphony In Memory of the Victims of Fascism and War.
Gavin Bryars, whose Jesus Blood Never Failed Me Yet was one of the unlikely
successes of last year, has based his latest work on one of the greatest
tragedies of the century. The Sinking of the Titanic (Point) takes as its
starting point the reported fact that the ship's band kept playing even as
she went down. Bryars's sombre piece is intensely uncomfortable to listen
to, but it is a remarkably bold and haunting experiment.

FT  31 OCT 94 / FT Guide to the Future of Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's seems to be heading for radical change? How radical is it really?
By the 21st century, Lloyd's might in theory find itself transformed. Names
 -the individuals whose assets have historically been invested on the basis
of unlimited liability - may have switched to limited liability. Their
investments may even be subsumed in a few large companies, many listed on
stock exchanges, which might dominate the 300-year-old London insurance
market.
However, all this could prove to be a fantasy. In practice, changes are only
being made gradually. This is partly because the volume of corporate capital
in the market is growing slowly, accounting for only about 15 per cent of
funds at Lloyd's this year. Traditional Names remain the dominant voice and
are anxious to protect their interests.
But the slow pace of change is also because Lloyd's has yet to shake off
past problems. Losses between 1989 and 1991 totalled Pounds 7bn. Many
possible asbestosis and pollution liabilities outstanding on old policies,
some dating to the 1940s, have yet to be quantified. Lloyd's must settle its
debts as well as try and make plans for the future.
For these reasons, David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, and Peter Middleton,
chief executive, have not attempted wholesale reform of Lloyd's. Their first
aim has been to restore profitability, and that has left many anomalies
untackled. For instance, the market still trades via syndicates which are
reformed each year. Normal insurance companies, which smooth losses and
profits over several years, regard such practices as bizarre and outdated.
Is change the result of Lloyd's troubles?
Yes. If the market had been making profits in the past few years - or even
modest losses - the impetus for reform would not have been as strong.
Lossmaking Names appear to be making progress in winning compensation in
court for past losses. Won't that stymie Lloyd's reforms?
Not directly. The disputes are between Names and the professional agencies
which handled their money, rather than Lloyd's central organisation.
Compensation will be paid out of the assets or insurance policies of those
agencies, some of which are in liquidation.
Inevitably, however, some of the bad feeling between Names and agents has
wider repercussions, and will deter future investors. Lloyd's also faces a
struggle in recouping money that should have come from Names but which it
has paid out of its central fund, which protects policy-holders.
Why should anyone want to invest again on the basis of 'unlimited
liability'?
Unlimited liability may seem a legal nonsense - after all, nobody has
unlimited assets. But the fact that in the past Names have been prepared to
risk all their assets meant that a higher level of gearing was possible.
Some of the wealthiest Names, for instance, are allowed by Lloyd's rules to
underwrite policies worth five times their investment. That increases the
risks, but also the returns. Corporate capital generally cannot arrange such
high gearing.
Moreover, many Names who are able to continue trading might be advised to
remain in the market. Lloyd's is expected to record profits in the 1993 and
probably 1994 underwriting years. Under Lloyd's accounting rules, those
profits should begin to flow into Names' bank accounts over the next few
years.
Who would want to invest via one of the new Lloyd's companies?
Lloyd's image has not been helped by its past losses and the continuing
publicity surrounding the Names' court battles. The market's structure is
also byzantine, making it cumbersome and difficult for investors to
understand.
But Lloyd's is currently making money and has considerable underwriting
expertise. That makes it attractive for some investors. The future success
of corporate capital will depend on the ingenuity of corporate financiers in
setting up vehicles which offer the prospect of decent returns - as well as
whether Rowland and Middleton succeed in streamlining Lloyd's organisation
and ensuring long-term profitability.
Will the cost of insurance premiums be affected by reform at Lloyd's?
Almost certainly not. In fact, the chain of causation might be the other way
around. Lloyd's fortunes may well be determined by its ability to ride out
the next downturn in a cyclical world insurance market. The danger is of
premium rates softening in the good times, leaving the market prone to
losses in future. That would not only speed the exit of the traditional Name
but deter many corporate investors.

HORSE RACING. November 1, Melbourne Cup, Flemington, Melbourne. November 5,
Breeders' Cup meeting, Churchill Downs, Louisville, Kentucky.
Increasingly, star racehorses are jetting the globe for cash and kudos.
Long-haul travel does not suit all racehorses, but the success of the
Irish-based Vintage Crop in last year's Melbourne Cup proved an eye-opener
for top owners. Vintage Crop has again been flown to Melbourne, though a leg
injury last week was a worry. A better prospect in a tricksy race (the
Melbourne Cup is a handicap) may be fellow long-haul traveller Quick Ransom
from Mark Johnston's Yorkshire stable, who receives weight from Vintage
Crop. Quick Ransom shed 18 kilos on the flight to Australia but regained
most of them swiftly and is said to be spot on. In Kentucky, the 11th
staging of the lucrative Breeders' Cup races - seven in total, five on dirt,
two on grass, with prize money of Dollars 10m - sees the biggest overseas
challenge yet. A record 26 European horses are due to appear in different
races, half of them from Britain. Europe's raid is strongest in the Classic,
Turf and Mile events (the latter two on grass), while Britain's brightest
chance lies with flying mare Lochsong, who faces 13 US rivals in the Sprint.
Only Pebbles (1985) and Sheikh Albadou (1991) have won for Britain in 77
Breeders' Cup races. The odds against a British win of any sort are quoted
at a sobering 2-1.
FOOTBALL. November 1, Uefa Cup, 2nd round, 2nd leg, Athletico Bilbao v
Newcastle, Aston Villa v Trabzonspor. November 2, European Champions' League
Group A, FC Barcelona v Manchester United. November 3, European Cup Winners'
Cup, Austria Vienna v Chelsea, Arsenal v Brondby.
Five English clubs compete in European this week, with the hardest task
appearing to face Chelsea who are away to FK Austria Vienna, or Austria
Memphis as they now prefer to be called. No English club has ever lost to an
Austrian club in a European competition, but Chelsea's walking wounded could
put that right on Thursday. They drew the first leg 0-0 at Stamford Bridge,
and it really will be a funny old game if Glenn Hoddle's men can produce
those 'Goodnight Vienna' headlines come Friday. Also in the Cup Winners'
Cup, holders Arsenal take a 2-1 lead over Brondby into the game at Highbury.
In the Uefa Cup, Aston Villa entertain Trabzonspor after losing 1-0 in
Turkey, and Premiership leaders Newcastle are away to Athletico Bilbao.
Kevin Keegan's side nodded off for a while in the first leg. After leading
3-0 they finished the game 3-2 up, and take that advantage to Spain.
Meanwhile, in the big one - the European Champions League - Manchester
United go to Barcelona. Over 100,000 Catalans have booked their seats in the
Nou Camp, and United will be hoping for the kind of refereeing they enjoyed
in the Premier League this month against Blackburn.
RUGBY LEAGUE. November 5, Great Britain v Australia, 2nd John Smith's Test,
Old Trafford.
What happened to the invincible Kangaroos at Wembley? Great Britain's 8-4
victory over the Australians in the first John Smith's Test has had the
Tourists checking video evidence to see how they managed to lose 'the match
Great Britain couldn't win'. The Australians, however, will take heart from
the fact that in 1990 they came back from a surprise Wembley defeat to take
the series 2-1, and that it is nearly 30 years since they lost a series to
Great Britain.
MOTOR RACING. November 6, Japanese Grand Prix, Suzuka.
The deaths of Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger apart, this year's
Formula One title chase has been superb unscripted drama - strong
characterisation and a thrilling, if sometimes unbelievable, plot. With two
races to go and only five points between them, the pressure has even got to
two of the sport's Mr Nice Guys, with Michael Schumacher (Benetton) and
Damon Hill (Williams) hurling ever more vicious insults at each other in the
press. Schumacher could clinch the title at Suzuka, but admits it is a
circuit where Williams may have a power advantage. Off the track in Japan,
all talk will be of who will be racing for whom next season, and which
engines will power which cars. Peugeot announced last Tuesday that it is
switching its engines from McLaren to Jordan for 1995. This was brought
about by one of the biggest motor racing alliances for many a year, in which
Mercedes engines are to be used by the McLaren team. The German manufacturer
already supplies race engines to the Penske team for US IndyCar events, and
both Penske and McLaren are sponsored by Marlboro. The strong tip is that
Mercedes' agreement with the British team will also involve a commitment to
the IndyCar series, and that Schumacher will join McLaren when his contract
with Benetton finishes next year.

Sport is Australia's established church. Something has to be, in what is one
of the world's most enthusiastically secular nations, a place where
organised religion is seldom glimpsed. In Perth, England's cricketers are
currently playing Western Australia in the first major game of the Ashes
tour.
For England players such as Darren Gough and Joey Benjamin, debutantes Down
Under, their first hours in the vast amphitheatre of the West Australian
Cricket Association ground (or WACA, to rhyme with Packer) will be
unforgettable.
The pitch is as iron-hard as the spectators, let alone the Aussie
cricketers. Ten years ago I awoke, jet-lagged, on the first day of my first
visit to Australia in a hotel room adjoining the WACA. An England v
Australia Test match was in progress. It was a Saturday, so I found my way
to the main stand, on the fringe of a group of tough-looking characters each
with a two-litre jug of ice-cold Emu lager to hand. Their concentration on
every ball and every stroke was ferocious. At the tea interval I summoned
the courage to ask if they had come far to see the match.
They were iron-ore miners from the Pilbara, based at Port Hedland nearly
1,000 miles away, and had driven down through the night to see just one day
of the Test. Most had to be back at work the next morning. It was a
revelatory insight into the commitment - sometimes joyless but always
effective - that sport inspires across the Wide Brown Land.
A few days ago a friend in Sydney sent me a copy of The Bid, a
recently-published account of how Sydney won the battle to host the 2000
Olympic Games. Since the author of the book is Rod McGeoch, the corporate
lawyer who spent three years and ADollars 28m (Pounds 12.5m) as head of the
bidding team, it should be the inside story. Overall it reminds me in tone
and content of nothing so much as modern military history - the unglimpsed
staff-work behind victory in the Falklands or on the Normandy beaches, for
example.
McGeoch's team knew from Day 1 that their goal was to capture the votes of
94 members of the International Olympic Committee. Athens' loss to Atlanta
in 1990 had convinced them that underdogs could win. 'Sentimental favourites
and powerful candidates could be beaten using a well thought-out strategy
based on building personal relationships with the IOC members', writes
McGeoch, who, at the outset of the campaign, had never met anyone from the
IOC.
Sydney put a remarkable effort into getting this all-powerful electorate to
visit them. When the IOC held its 1991 annual conference in Birmingham,
McGeoch and his team were naturally prowling the lobbies, urging 'the
voters' to hop on a Qantas flight asap. Furthermore, they had an official of
the Australian Immigration Service, a department modelled on the Kremlin,
sitting in reception at the Hyatt Regency handing out instant visas.
Lobbies and lobbying loom large in The Bid. McGeoch and his charm offensive
were constantly present at major international sports conferences. 'We would
go to all the official functions', he writes. 'But a large part of what we
did was actually wait around hotel lobbies where members were either staying
or attending meetings to catch them for a chat. . . I'd insist we had a
roster of people to wait around the lobbies. When our wives travelled with
us they too would be rostered. We used to call ourselves 'lobby lizards'.'
At the Albertville winter Olympics, New South Wales premier Nick Greiner
caught a little flak for slipping the lobby leash and going off skiing. At
the IOC session in Birmingham the Aussies would rise at dawn to ensure that
they got the largest, most prominent table at breakfast in the Hyatt, so
that members might join them for coffee and croissants if they wished.
A campaign rule rigidly precluded approaching any VIP who was already
eating. Government, both state and federal, figures largely in this account.
Manchester, which was bidding for the same Games, made much of the fact that
it had some Whitehall cash and occasionally got to see prime minister John
Major. Sydney's bid had politicians crawling all over it, and was
practically an arm of the state.
'I always had to remember that I was a public servant whose responsibility
it was to make sure that I did not embarrass my minister,' writes McGeoch.
Beijing was Sydney's great rival for the 2000 Olympics, and The Bid focuses
on the 'official' nature of China's campaign, with hundreds of government
officials scurrying around. Yet in some ways this 'quango' element was what
the two favourites had in common.
Manchester and Berlin, in comparison, were models of free enterprise
initiative. When the IOC members were actually in Sydney they were feted
beyond belief, not so much with lavish wining and dining - now against the
rules - but with little tricks that money couldn't buy.
One night at the Opera House an IOC member's wife became unavoidably delayed
in the ladies' toilet during the interval. Despite an increasingly restive
audience, the general manager was summoned and told that the show must not
go on. Not a note was sung until 'Mrs K' had resumed her seat.
England's cricketers are about to start a battle for the Ashes against a
team as formidably well prepared as Australia's Olympic campaign. In
business, Australians tend to cut corners. Culturally, they aim low. But in
sport they will pay any price and make any sacrifice to win.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Management: Satisfaction guaranteed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Design to Distribution (D2D), the ICL subsidiary which won this year's
European Quality Award, attributes a fundamental improvement in its
performance to total quality management. 'Quality management satisfies
customers, reduces costs and motivates people,' says Alastair Kelly,
managing director.
TQM has helped D2D, a contract electronics manufacturer, achieve a 300 per
cent increase in staff productivity since 1980 and save Pounds 2m a year
from 'getting things right first time,' he says.
But after 10 years of working on TQM, he emphasises that the technique is
'no quick fix'. D2D has gone through several stages of using TQM, in which
it experimented with different techniques and addressed a succession of
issues.
The company had to reappraise its approach at one point. After many years of
applying TQM and winning various awards, D2D had disappointing results in
1990 when it polled customers for their views. It found that many of their
requirements had not been included in the company's evaluation model.
As a result, it adopted the business model constructed by the European
Foundation for Quality Management which encouraged it to take a more
comprehensive approach to quality issues. As part of this, it tried to
improve customer service by training staff and introducing a score-card
system to allow customers to specify exactly what they needed.
The EFQM model requires a company to assess itself on nine issues, namely
leadership, policy and strategy, people management, resources, processes,
customer satisfaction, people satisfaction, impact on society and business
results.
Many companies use this model for their own assessment purposes without
putting themselves forward for the European Quality Award. Those companies
which do go forward for the award prepare a report which is scrutinised by a
six-member team of assessors; companies that are short-listed receive a site
visit.
The companies deemed to have demonstrated the highest standards of TQM are
given a quality prize; the best is given the European Quality Award. This
year's other prize winners were IBM SEMEA, which manages IBM operations in
southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, headquartered in Italy, and
Ericsson of Spain, a Spanish subsidiary of the telecommunications company.
All applicants for the award receive a feedback report, highlighting their
strengths and weaknesses. For D2D, its assessment showed that it needed to
improve its performance concerning its 'impact on society' and 'business
results'.
Winning the EFQM's award does not mean D2D can relax in its efforts to
improve the quality of its business, says Kelly. 'It is a milestone but not
the end of the journey,' he says. 'The moment we stop changing we start to
die.'
Brochures for self assessment and applications for the 1995 award are
available from EFQM, Avenue des Pleiades 19, 1200 Brussels, Belgium.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Management: Two steps forward, one step back - Vanessa
Houlder examines why Total Quality Management has been slow to take root in
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total Quality Management, one of the most pervasive management doctrines of
the 1980s, has lost some of its glamour in recent years. But its central
idea - that quality should be applied to every aspect of an organisation -
still commands passionate support from its converts.
'Quality is a way of life,' declares Jan Timmer, president of Philips
Electronics, the Dutch group. 'Total quality is not a passing business fad
but embedded in the permanent principles of human philosophy,' says Louis
Schweitzer, president directeur general of Renault, the French car company.
These endorsements, made at a European Quality Management Forum in Amsterdam
this month, reflect the strength of enthusiasm expressed by exponents of the
quality movement. Its advocates are eloquent about its central themes,
namely the importance of the customer, the case for empowering employees,
the need to view business activities as processes and the goal of continuous
improvement.
The rhetoric associated with TQM is underpinned by a serious debate. Is
Europe once again falling behind on quality? If so, is TQM, which is no
longer viewed as a panacea in the US, the best way forward?
Europe's take-up of TQM remains well behind that of the US, which adopted
TQM in the 1980s, and Japan, where TQM first became entrenched in the 1950s
and 1960s. A survey by the European Foundation for Quality Management, the
Brussels-based body which organised the Amsterdam conference, found that 30
per cent of European companies claim to have adopted TQM, compared with 55
per cent in North America and 53 per cent in Asia. Even fewer European
companies - a mere 5-10 per cent - are actively pursuing TQM, it says.
Champions of TQM view these figures with dismay. 'European companies will
fall short on quality if they do not participate in TQM,' according to Geert
de Raad, the EFQM's secretary general. The European Commission is also
concerned. It has proposed a 'European policy for the Promotion of Quality'
in a recent white paper.
A particular concern for the promoters of TQM is to extend its reach into
countries, such as Germany, where it has made little impact, although BASF,
Siemens, Grundig and Volkswagen are notable exceptions.
'In Germany where quality has always been established, TQM is not as easily
accepted as in many other countries,' says de Raad.
The mixed reviews earned by TQM should not necessarily be a deterrent. When
the Conference Board, a business membership organisation, reviewed a large
number of reports on TQM last year, it concluded that 'progress in this
difficult area appears generally positive'.
That said, many problems recur in implementing TQM. A particular challenge
concerns winning the support of employees, especially in companies where
morale is undermined by redundancies or where the top management is seen to
lack a 'gut commitment' to quality.
Middle managers, in particular, are often unenthusiastic about 'empowering'
their subordinates. 'Middle management are going to find it hard to delegate
the responsibility when their own jobs depend on meeting budget targets,'
says Peter Herriot, director of research at Sundridge Park Management Centre
in the UK.
Another common criticism of TQM is that it is too inward-looking. An
obsession with methodology and standards can distract a company from chasing
sales. Excessive red tape can make employees disillusioned. An early quality
programme run by Philips Electronics, for instance, failed because of 'an
overemphasis on systems and procedures and forms to fill', Timmer explained
at this month's Amsterdam gathering.
But champions of TQM believe that it should focus the minds of managers on
both external and internal factors. The model publicised by the EFQM, for
instance, stresses business results, the impact on society, people
satisfaction and customer satisfaction, as well as internal issues such as
processes, policy, people management and leadership.
One of the tasks facing promoters of TQM is how to increase the uptake of
total quality in different types of organisation. Its most notable successes
have been concentrated in manufacturing companies, primarily in large
international companies. All three winners of the European Quality award
sponsored by the EFQM have, so far, had foreign parents.
The relatively low number of quality accolades won by the service sector in
Europe can partly be explained by their tendency to adopt TQM later than
manufacturers, many of which were brought into total quality by adopting
quality standards.
Companies with a strong marketing bias have also moved into TQM relatively
late, partly because they found TQM's emphasis on customer satisfaction
'boringly bland', according to John Sharpe, chairman of Birds Eye Wall's. He
believes, however, that TQM can help companies address neglected issues.
Smaller companies have also tended to be slow to take up TQM, partly because
managers may feel too busy to undertake the extra work and partly because
they are often more closely in touch with their customers than larger
companies.
Increasingly, however, they may be under pressure to fall in line with the
demands of larger customers.
'Unless suppliers are in tune with the quality demands of their customers
they will not be able to meet their demands,' says Clive Capp, managing
director of Howard UK, an IT support company that has enthusiastically
endorsed TQM.
Public-sector organisations are also begining to experiment with TQM. The
principles of TQM for non-profit organisations are no different than from
any commercial organisation, once they define the nature of their customers
and their results, says Ian Raisbeck, director of quality at the Royal Mail.
The EFQM is making efforts to bring more small companies and non-profit
organisations into its fold. At the same time, it is working on promoting
TQM in under-represented countries, notably Germany.
The attitude of German companies may be changing, according to the findings
of a separate report by the Conference Board.
'As global competition intensifies, German companies are concluding that a
narrow definition of product quality is no longer sufficient to ensure
success,' it says.
Evidence suggests, therefore, that TQM is gradually building up momentum in
Europe, although progress remains slow in several sectors and countries. The
promoters of TQM have a tough challenge in sustaining interest in TQM in the
notoriously fickle marketplace for management concepts.
Enthusiasts, such as Schweitzer, are convinced that TQM will not be
superseded by other management fads.
'The principles of TQM are a matrix in which many other doctrines fit,' he
says. 'The basic principles of total quality are permanent principles of
good management.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / Management: Of fish 'eads, baked beans and cola
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are signs, say researchers, of a tilt in consumer sentiment away from
cut-price, own-label goods and back towards higher-priced branded ones. But
the 'demanding consumer' - acutely value-conscious and sceptical about
advertising claims - is now said to be a fixture of the retail landscape.
That sounds correct to me, though I find myself moving in the opposite
direction to the general mood. For example, I have boycotted own-label food
products for years. This followed a visit, one freezing morning, to a scene
from hell: a processing plant in Hull where fishwives working for a famous
food manufacturer were gutting and filleting the catch. My fur coat made
them giggle.
I approached one of the women. She was placing each brilliantly-sliced
fillet in a tray packed with ice and throwing the head, tail and bones into
a bucket at her elbow.
I said: 'What's the bucket for?'
She replied that the scraps in the bucket were used by her employer to make
own-label fish-fingers for a supermarket chain. I said I found that
shocking. She said: 'You've 'ardly lived, my robin. There's nothing wrong
with 'eads.'
After that I ignored own-label products, believing, in any case, what
marketing folk told me: that the higher prices charged by makers of branded
goods reflected what they said they did: superior product development and
quality as trumpeted, expensively, in their advertising campaigns. Yet
own-label products have got better and better. Today, almost all my
supermarket purchases of commodity-type items are retailers' own-label.
Some weeks ago I had lunch with David Sainsbury, chairman of J Sainsbury,
Britain's leading grocery chain. I discovered that we both do our
supermarket shopping at the same branch of Sainsbury's, the one near Notting
Hill. I find this supremely comforting because it strikes me that the
ferocity of the price-cutting and the IQ of the staff are likely to be most
pronounced in the branch of Sainsbury's round which the man who owns 17 per
cent of the shares is wont to push his trolley.
I asked Sainsbury about his public row with Coca-Cola over Sainsbury's
look-alike own-label cola. Coke had claimed, crossly, that the look-alike's
packaging imitated its own too flatteringly.
Sainsbury was vivaciously unrepentant. 'Fifty-five per cent of our (packaged
grocery) sales are own-label,' he said. 'We have always been in the business
of finding better-value products than the branded ones. For the first time a
cola has been found that is as good as Coca-Cola. That is a new situation
for Coke.'
And a worrying one, too. Today, every Tom, Dick and Harry has his own cola.
To survive, owners of commodity-type brands (not just grocery ones) will
have to raise their game. The other morning I was round at Sainsbury's,
studying the shelf-space devoted to baked beans. What I saw was a continuing
death-struggle between Heinz and Sainsbury's own brand.
Heinz offers a few lacklustre variants, including baked beans with bacon or
with eight pork sausages. But nothing remotely hip. Why doesn't Heinz give
us baked beans with truffles, or with goose leg?
The president of Heinz is Tony O'Reilly. Next time you see him, ask him what
he's doing.
Hugo Boss, Germany's leading maker of 'upscale' menswear, has a thrusting
chief executive: Peter Littmann, 46. Littmann is astute, but he ought to
study some of the promotional material pumped out by corporate HQ in
Metzingen. It is some of the wackiest stuff imaginable - a terrifying
example of what might emerge if you hooked up 10 word processors in your
marketing department to 10 word processors in your PR agency and let them
get on with it.
Littmann's career has included broadcasting, film-making, carpets,
porcelain. In March last year he was made boss of Hugo Boss, and five months
later split the Boss range into three distinct brands. They are called HUGO
Hugo Boss, BOSS Hugo Boss, and BALDESSARINI Hugo Boss, after the chief
designer.
HUGO Hugo Boss is for younger customers; BOSS Hugo Boss focuses on
business-wear; and BALDESSARINI Hugo Boss is positioned as a top-flight
range of hand-tailored clothes. HUGO Hugo Boss man and BOSS Hugo Boss man
are reasonably exotic dudes. But the most exotic dude is BALDESSARINI Hugo
Boss man.
According to the word processors, BALDESSARINI Hugo Boss man has 'charisma
and sovereign ways . . . He is cosmopolitan and conservative, whether he is
an executive or a successful artist with a passion for perfection . . . He
shows a marked interest in culture; his sports - golf, yachting, hunting -
are as distinguished as his lifestyle.'
On and on it goes, indefatigably, a mish-mash of images, utterly surreal.
They call this marketing? Littmann should sprint round HQ and rip all the
plugs out. Things need to cool down at Hugo Boss.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Douglas McGregor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Knowingly or otherwise, every western manager who is applying the lessons
learned on an organisational 'change' programme of any kind has become a
follower of this social psychologist-turned college president (1906-1964).
His influence has reached us by two routes over the past decade: through the
work of popular writers such as Tom Peters, Robert Waterman, Rosabeth Moss
Kanter and Warren Bennis, the leadership expert who was a pupil of McGregor;
and via his impact on modern performance appraisal processes, reward systems
and other personnel management techniques.
McGregor's main contribution came just four years before his death, in The
Human Side of Enterprise, a book which transformed into a convincing
managerial theory the overworked and often cynical mantra that 'an
organisation's greatest asset is its people'. The theory was taken to
extremes by the 'human relations' school which followed McGregor: its
excessive emphasis on bottom-up management at the expense of authority
damaged his credibility. But the more balanced practice of his principles in
recent years has rightly restored his reputation.
McGregor's creed will be familiar to every manager trying to operate in a
flat, high-performance organisation in Europe or the US today; that most
people, in most situations, are best motivated by being treated as part of a
community where objectives and responsibility are shared. They will then
exercise self-direction and self-control, and use their creativity to help
resolve the organisation's problems.
This doctrine of 'intrinsic' motivation, which McGregor christened 'Theory
Y', contrasted starkly with the traditional command-and-control doctrine
propounded earlier in the century by, among others, Henri Fayll, and still
practised by many organisations today.
McGregor called this 'Theory X', and lambasted managers for subscribing to
its underlying assumption that most human beings are lazy, avoid work and
responsibility and need to be controlled, threatened and kicked in order to
contribute even just adequately to organisational objectives.
McGregor's distinction between theories X and Y has become so influential in
the US and Europe over the past few years that it has been taken as being
applicable around the world. But this is open to question. In a speech last
month Gerrt Hofstede, an expert in national cultures, argued that the
distinction is irrelevant, for instance, in south-east Asia, where people's
attitudes to work, and to the groups of which they form part, are very
different from those of westerners.
As with so many other culture-bound management principles - eastern as well
as western - the worst mistake of all is to think that McGregor's approach
constitutes the 'one best way' of doing things in all circumstances. To
embroider an accolade from Bennis, 'McGregorian chant' may be 'profoundly
true' in the west, but not for everyone everywhere.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Historic ship cruises through city centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the world's most historic and revolutionary ships, the 100-year-old
Turbinia, made its final voyage yesterday - by road - through the centre of
Newcastle upon Tyne to the Discovery Museum, Chris Tighe writes.
Once the fastest ship on the oceans, Turbinia was the world's first
turbine-propelled vessel. Its construction in 1894 changed the face of
maritime engineering. The ship was designed by Sir Charles Parsons, inventor
of the steam turbine and one of a highly influential set of engineers who
made Victorian Tyneside an internationally renowned centre of innovation.
Turbinia astonished spectators at Queen Victoria's Spithead review in 1897,
setting a record speed afloat of 34 knots, about 40mph. The ship was laid up
in 1908 and for the past nine years the fragile 100ft long vessel has been
in storage in Newcastle, away from public view.
Yesterday, in a painstaking two-hour removal operation, it was transported
by road at 5mph on a specially constructed cradle.
Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, which includes turbine-generator
manufacturer Parsons, the company founded by Sir Charles, paid the Pounds
62,000 cost of moving Turbinia and making the structural steel supports on
which it will rest at the museum.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Engineering warms to minimum wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Four out of 10 UK engineering companies support the introduction of a
statutory minimum wage, says a survey from the Engineering Employers
Federation.
Although just over half those polled opposed the idea, the level of support
among 100 engineering business leaders is surprisingly high.
A similar number believed a minimum wage would have no effect on
unemployment levels, while 51 per cent said the jobless total would rise.
More predictably, two-thirds of companies said that accepting the provisions
of the European Union's social chapter would lead to substantial job losses
in the UK.
The results are contained in the EEF Manufacturing Matters Survey, conducted
in the approach to today's Manufacturing Matters conference in London.
More than half of those polled said short-termism by the government had
con-tributed to the decline in British industry in the past decade.
Government attitudes were blamed by 58 per cent of companies in the survey,
a slightly higher proportion than those blaming short-termism among
management or in the City, or the 'roller-coaster economy' and high interest
rates.
Mr Graham Mackenzie, the EEF's director-general, said: 'This survey
reinforces concern among engineering businesses that a longer-term strategic
outlook is needed from government, industry and the City if UK manufacturing
is to be competitive.'
The poll was sponsored by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountants, and Lloyds
Bank Commercial Service. Employers who recruit permanent staff from the
unemployed register should be exempt for a period from paying national
insurance contributions as a stimulus to help the long-term jobless back
into work, Robert Taylor writes.
This is the key proposal published today by the EEF in its response to the
white paper on competitiveness.
Mr Mackenzie said: 'I believe this kind of incentive would spur on the
movement of people back to work.'
The response is critical of the white paper. 'It does not provide the
strategic vision which the EEF had been hoping for,' it says.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Female boost for family earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The average male contribution to household budgets has fallen to 60 per cent
from 75 per cent in the early 1980s, says research published today by the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation.
Families headed by a single male breadwinner are now outnumbered nearly
three to one by homes where both partners work. Married or cohabiting women
with part-time jobs now typically contribute 20 per cent of family income.
This rises to 40 per cent for those who work full-time.
Other findings of the research - by Ms Susan Harkness, Mr Stephen Machin,
and Ms Jane Waldfogel - include:
Average family income grew by 48 per cent between 1979 and 1991. However, a
big increase in the number of women taking paid work meant that women's
average earnings grew four times faster (90 per cent) than those of men (23
per cent).
The pay gap between women and men in families headed by a married or
cohabiting couple has narrowed. Women's wages were 65 per cent of men's in
1991 compared with 57 per cent in 1979.
The proportion of married or cohabiting women with jobs who work full-time
rose from 43 per cent in 1979 to 50 per cent in 1991. But the increase in
living standards among dual-earner households is not matched among
one-parent families where the full-time employment rate fell from 53 per
cent to 37 per cent.
Ms Harkness said: 'Our analysis demonstrates that without the increase in
women's work and earnings in the 1980s, inequalities between the richest and
poorest families would be even greater than they are today.'

<TEXT>
Interest rates should rise soon to hold down inflation, says a report
published today by City stockbroker Goldman Sachs, Daniel Green writes.
The report says that analysis of the firm's inflation indicators provides 'a
strong case' for the rise if the government wants inflation to remain in its
target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent. The warning comes ahead of
tomorrow's Bank of England third quarter inflation report and Wednesday's
meeting between the chancellor of the Exchequer and the Bank's governor.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Dairy trade in dual attack on Milk Marque
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents milk processing companies, is
to complain to the Office of Fair Trading and the European Commission about
the shake-up of the UK dairy market which begins tomorrow.
The market will undergo its biggest change for 61 years when the Milk
Marketing Board, the statutory buyer of milk, is abolished and farmers
become free to sell to any purchaser.
But the new arrangements, which take effect after six years of debate about
reform, could run into an early challenge from the competition authorities.
The Dairy Trade Federation will complain to the Office of Fair Trading and
the European Commission on the grounds that a regulated public monopoly is
being replaced by an unregulated private one. The complaint is directed at
Milk Marque, the voluntary farmers' co-operative set up by the board to act
as a milk broker with the board's chief executive, Mr Andrew Dare, as its
head.
Milk Marque has secured 66 per cent of supplies in England and Wales -
deregulation is taking place simultaneously in Scotland and is due next
April in Northern Ireland. The rest of the Pounds 3.3bn market is fragmented
between about 40 dairy companies or small groups of farmer-processors buying
direct from farms.
The dairy companies say this gives Milk Marque the power to push prices up
sharply. This, they say, is unreasonable since production is constrained by
European milk quotas that prevent British farmers from making more than 85
per cent of the domestic market's needs.
The immediate beneficiaries will be farmers, who will enjoy a price rise of
2p a litre next month. But liberalisation could anger both dairy companies
and consumers.
Mr Mark Lynch, food manufacturing analyst with brokers SG Warburg, expects
the supermarket price of a pint of milk to rise by about 1p - less than the
2p-3p suggested by processors, but still contrary to assurances in June by
Mrs Gillian Shephard, then agriculture minister, that consumers would
benefit from the new market.
He predicts that cheese, butter and yoghurt prices will also rise but says
dairy companies will be unable fully to recover their increased costs. Some
big groups such as Unigate have issued profits warnings.
Flotation of the board's processing arm, Dairy Crest, which was meant to
provide the working capital for Milk Marque, has been postponed
indefinitely. Dairy Crest has also announced the closure of two factories
with the total loss of 260 jobs because of the cost of milk.
Mr Roger Davenport, managing director of The Cheese Company, the UK's
biggest independent cheese manufacturer, says capacity is already being shed
as cheese manufacturers feel the squeeze. 'If this is allowed to go too far
it would be a tragedy not only for the country but also for the farmer.'
Nevertheless the dairy trade is not assured of success in its challenge to
the organisation's dominance. It could prove politically embarrassing for Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to refer Milk Marque to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission since it would imply criticism of the
government's approval of the new arrangements.

More companies in the east Midlands plan to raise capital spending than at
any time since 1990, the latest survey of business performance in the region
shows.
The survey of 946 companies by Price Waterhouse, accountants, and Nottingham
Business School which is published today shows 37 per cent of companies plan
an increase in capital spending and only 22 per cent a reduction. 'The
difference between the two of 15 percentage points is the highest since
spring 1990, before the recession began,' it says.
Greater enthusiasm for capital spending follows a rise in sales volume - 70
per cent of companies in September reported higher sales compared with 63
per cent in March.
Business confidence is at its highest since before the recession, with 75
per cent of companies expecting increased sales in the next six months.
Concern about rising raw material prices and tight profit margins - often
expressed in company financial results - did not crop up in the survey and
does not yet appear to be affecting general confidence.
Prospects for business growth and employment in north-west England are much
better than a year ago, says a survey published today, Daniel Green writes.
The latest in a series of annual studies by Manchester Business School and
accountants Price Waterhouse says 36 per cent of 500 companies surveyed
expect to employ more people in the next six months. This compares with 26
per cent a year ago.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Trademark legislation expected to save business up to Pounds
60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses will be able to register three-dimensional shapes, sounds and
smells as trademarks for the first time today as new legislation comes into
force.
The Trade Marks Act is designed to streamline and simplify procedures for
protecting brands and bring UK law into line with the rest of the European
Union.
The Patent Office estimates that the law will save British business up to
Pounds 60m in the first year and then Pounds 30m a year.
Half the savings in the first year will come from the UK's ratification of
the protocol to the Madrid Agreement on the international registration of
trademarks. This will allow UK companies to register their marks in all
countries which are party to the agreement in a single application.
The Patent Office is holding a draw for the first mark registered under the
new law - number 2,000,001. On November 10 trademark 2,000,001 will be
selected at random from applications received by hand between 9am and 10am
this morning at the Patent Office in London or Newport, Gwent. The Trade
Marks Registry expects more than 1,000 applications in the first hour.
Bass, the brewer, which was awarded trademark number one for its red
triangle in 1876, hopes to win 2,000,001 for a similar symbol used for Bass
Ale. The cost of an application will be Pounds 225. Registrations will be
renewable every 10 years.
The laws have produced a welter of advice from trademark lawyers. London
solicitors Lewis Silkin said that once branding had been protected there
would be no need to prove established goodwill and misrepresentation to
establish passing off, or to fight infringement of copyright or design right
battles.
Some marks will still be excluded from registration. These include names
which are exclusively descriptive or geographical, and shapes which result
from the nature of the goods or which give substantial value to the goods.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Tuning in to rising fortunes: Commercial radio is in a
confident mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Radio stations are to advertise in newspapers next year in an effort to
persuade businesses to advertise on radio.
The Pounds 2.5m campaign, aimed at decision-making readers of the broadsheet
papers, claims that radio reaches 59 per cent of business people each week -
'more than the combined readership of The Times, Financial Times and Daily
Telegraph.'
The hope is that the campaign, backed by radio advertising which would cost
a further Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m at rate-card prices, will help propel radio
advertising towards 6 per cent of display advertising by the end of the
decade.
The campaign is a further sign of confidence and determination in an
industry that two years ago had revenues stuck at 2 per cent of total
advertising, and was ignored by many of the biggest brands and advertising
agencies.
It also coincides with an important symbolic crossover. Last week, for the
first time in 21 years, the commercial sector won a bigger share of the
total listening audience than the BBC.
Revenues of Pounds 56.7m in the third quarter also mean the industry is on
course to take a 4 per cent share of advertising for the first time this
year, with more than half coming from national as opposed to local
advertising.
Mr David Mansfield, commercial director of Capital Radio, told the
Commercial Radio Convention in Dublin at the weekend: 'Radio is no longer
the medium of last resort. People are buying it for its unique qualities.'
Advertisers and advertising agencies even felt the need at the convention to
warn the industry of the difficulties of managing success and the need to
avoid complacency and arrogance and putting their rates up too much. The
most important single factor in the transformation has been the launch of
the national commercial stations Classic FM and Virgin 1215, plus the
'unofficial' national station Atlantic 252 that broadcasts to the UK from
the Republic of Ireland.
Many advertisers have come to radio for the first time to advertise on the
national stations - encouraged by the Radio Advertising Bureau, the first
effective body set up to promote commercial radio - and have migrated to the
existing independent local stations.
Essex Radio, for example, expects to increase its national advertising
revenues this year from about Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1m. A high proportion
of the extra money will drop straight to the bottom line to boost profits.
Last year the station had about 30 different national brands a month. Now it
is about 50.
The growth in confidence seems to be helping new stations coming on air. Mr
Richard Huntingford, chief executive of Chrysalis Radio which launched Heart
FM - one of the five new regional stations launched in September - said the
station was already in profit at the trading level. Mr Huntingford said the
soft rock format had 'exceeded our wildest expectations' with advertising
revenue for October at 185 per cent of budget.
The BBC will almost certainly continue to lose listening share as new
stations come on air and may, according to Henley Centre estimates, fall to
a 44 per cent share by 1999.
At the weekend the Radio Authority, the body that regulates the industry,
announced its plan for commercial radio development in the next 18 months to
two years. On top of four new regional stations in the Yorkshire area, East
Anglia, the east Midlands and Solent, the authority is planning up to 20 new
local commercial stations in places as diverse as the Western Isles, Oban,
the Yorkshire Dales, Oxford, Cambridge and Basingstoke. In addition a third
raft of local stations is being considered, for example in Bromley or
Lewisham in south-east London.
A further boost to commercial radio revenues and audiences will come on
February 4 next year, the expected launch date for Talk Radio UK, the last
of the three official national commercial stations planned for the UK. By
next year there will be at least 18 commercial stations broadcasting in the
London area.
Mr David Vick, director of development at the Radio Authority, said: 'The
worst has yet to come for the BBC.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / Major set for sleaze fightback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday offered strong backing for Mr Jonathan Aitken, the
Treasury chief secretary, as the government prepared for a Commons
confrontation over allegations of ministerial sleaze.
The prime minister's stance came amid strong attacks by Conservative MPs on
Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, following the disclosure that his
newspaper had used House of Commons notepaper to obtain a copy of Mr
Aitken's Pounds 1,000 bill for a stay at the Ritz Hotel in Paris last year.
Mr Preston said the note-paper, bearing Mr Aitken's name, had not been used
to deceive or mislead, but to protect the newspaper's source - Mr Mohamed
Fayed, the owner of Harrods and the Ritz.
But Sir James Spicer, a member of the powerful privileges committee, was
among a number of senior Conservative MPs condemning the action and
demanding an investigation by the Commons into the news-paper's action.
Mr Aitken - at the centre of a political row over the payment of his bill at
the Ritz - meanwhile dismissed suggestions that he had broken parliamentary
rules by not declaring a company directorship.
Friends of the Treasury minister said the company involved - Fadace Ltd -
was an inconsequential offshoot of another company, Al Bilah Co UK, which
had been declared by the minister in the register of MPs' interests. Mr
Aitken received no salary or fees from Fadace.
Mr Major's backing for Mr Aitken followed renewed demands from Labour for
the Commons to hold public rather than private hearings into allegations of
financial impropriety.
But Downing Street said Mr Major had not budged from his view that public
hearings would prompt unfounded smears against innocent MPs. Senior
Conservatives added that the government could not intervene in the work of
the all-party privileges committee without challenging its long-standing
tradition of independence.
Labour, whose MPs are boycotting the present investigations, has tabled a
motion for today's Commons debate demanding public hearings by the
privileges committee of charges against individual MPs. But a government
amendment says the committee itself must decide on its procedures.
In spite of today's expected confrontation senior Conservatives stressed
that there was still scope for a compromise between Labour and Tory MPs on
the committee. One suggestion was that individuals' evidence could be heard
in private while the committee held public sessions to debate wider points
of principle.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Optimism about job prospects increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Public optimism about general employment prospects has risen in the latest
FT/MFS Mood of the Nation index published today, but people are increasingly
anxious about their own futures.
After falling to 83 points in early September because of the rise in
interest rates - its lowest since last spring - the index climbed to 88
points in October.
The survey also indicates, however, that a sharp decline has taken place in
the proportion of people who are optimistic about their own prospects in the
next 12 months.
Only 29 per cent said they expected their personal economic position to
improve in the period, while 20 per cent said it would get worse by next
October. As many as 44 per cent said their position would remain the same.
More people believe Britain's general economic condition will worsen in the
next 12 months than improve, which suggests that considerable doubt about
the recovery remains.
While 23 per cent believe the economy will improve between now and next
October, 35 per cent said that it would get worse and 37 per cent that it
would stay the same. By contrast 21 per cent said they were 'very concerned'
about being made redundant or becoming unemployed and 20 per cent were
'fairly concerned'.
Britain will not experience a sharp return to wage inflation or an
escalation in pay settlements in the next 12 months, says the independent
Industrial Relations Services in its annual review of pay prospects
published today.
The report says settlements are likely to rise by between 3 per cent and 3.5
per cent early next year.
IRS says that the downward pressure on settlements in recent years, caused
by poor corporate performance and an inability to raise product prices,
remains strong.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Hambros explores rail stock interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambros Bank, which has been appointed to market the three railway
rolling-stock leasing companies to be carved out of British Rail, this week
will start exploring Japanese interest in the sale.
Hambros executives, who last week visited the US, report strong initial
overseas enthusiasm. Industry analysts suggest that the three companies,
with combined annual revenues of Pounds 804m, could fetch between Pounds 2bn
and Pounds 4bn.
The companies will be expected to spend about 40 per cent of their turnover
on maintenance, but labour costs are low. Each employs about 50 people. The
companies, Eversholt Train Leasing, Poterbrook Leasing and Angel Train
Contracts, known together as the Roscos, own nearly all BR's passenger
trains.
In the next month Hambros will speak to all parties which it thinks could be
interested. It plans to issue a sales memorandum in the first quarter of
next year, to accept bids in early summer and to complete the sales by
autumn.
Hambros reports interest from UK venture capitalists, from US banks and
leasing companies, and from European organisations. No purchaser will be
allowed to own more than one Rosco, in order to create competition.
Mr Tony Mallin, vice-chairman of Hambros, said any purchaser would be well
placed to make further acquisitions in other countries.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Football ticket rules impose a penalty: The application
system for the European championship has amazed fans and Jacqueline Shorey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUELINE SHOREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tickets for the 1996 European football championship went on general sale
last Thursday. Application forms are available from any Midland Bank.
'Applying for Euro 96 tickets is so easy . . .' it said.
A friend and I wanted to see some group games and the final at Wembley.
To buy two final tickets I had to buy four for the semi-finals. The cheapest
option on current ticket availability for seeing games at Wembley - where
England's group will play - was to buy four Pounds 50 semi-final tickets,
two of which I did not want. Never mind, I thought. I will get rid of them.
However, the same rule applied for the quarter-finals - another four tickets
at Pounds 35. Another two spares.
The rules also said that I must buy tickets for three group matches in order
to qualify to buy tickets for the knock-out games (quarters, semis and the
final). Fair enough, I wanted to see some group games. However, the rules
said I could not buy more tickets for knock-out games than for group
matches.
Did I understand correctly? Did I really have to buy four tickets for each
of the three group matches?
I rang the helpline number. Yes, those were the rules. I had to buy 12
tickets at Pounds 25 each to qualify. That took the grand total - the
minimum I could spend - to Pounds 760, which included Pounds 320 for 10
tickets I did not want. I could have bought the best seats at Wembley and
spent Pounds 1,820, of which Pounds 780 would have been for 10 unwanted
tickets.
What to do with the spare tickets? The criminal justice bill will outlaw
touting and besides, the Football Association's conditions of sale say: 'A
ticket shall become void if it is passed on, with or without payment, to
another party without the prior consent of the FA.' I could not even give
them away.
Mr Steve Beauchampe, international officer of the Football Supporters'
Association, offered his opinion: 'Fans will fall into two categories, those
who sell the tickets on at face value - who wouldn't dream of ripping off
another supporter - and those who think: 'I've spent a lot of money up front
 -now's my chance to get a bit more back'.'
Mr Mike Parry of the FA said they expected the tournament to sell out and
had 'agonised' over the fairest possible ticket system. In order to give
priority to real fans tickets went on sale at the end of January to league
club season ticket holders and England Travel Club members who have already
bought 150,000 of the 1.3m tickets. In order to get tickets for the final,
they also had to buy tickets for earlier games, but had not been compelled
to buy 'spares' in order to qualify.
The 'progressive loyalty' system tried to ensure tickets for the later
stages of the competition went to real fans who had attended group games.
What about four fans, who had proved their loyalty by going to three group
matches, the quarters and semis. Their ticket purchases only qualify for two
final tickets. Did the FA have any advice on who should get the final
tickets? 'Toss a coin?' said Mr Parry.
Mr Beauchampe was not impressed. 'I was aghast when I read the ticket
application form,' he said. 'We accept that because of huge demand there
have to be restrictions on final tickets, and approved a scheme where people
had to go to group games to qualify. But to attend those games and then not
get a final ticket is unfair. The system betrays the loyalty of football
fans.'
What about fans from other countries in the competition? Unlike English fans
who are having to pay 20 months in advance, our European rivals will have
another year - until December 1995, when the draw is held. At least those
fans will know what they are buying - all the English fans can do now is
book a seat at a ground, even though fixtures have not been arranged.
Total ticket sales should generate about Pounds 60m. That money and the
interest it earns before June 1996 will go into a trust fund. After
expenses, profits will be split between the FA and Uefa, the European body,
and put back into the game.
Mr Parry denied that tickets had gone on sale too soon. The competition will
be twice the size of the Swedish championship in 1992, when tickets went on
sale 10 months in advance. 'This competition is twice as big and needs twice
the time,' he said.
Mr Rod Cornes of Synchro Systems, the Newcastle-under-Lyme software company
which is organising ticket sales on behalf of the FA, said 70 per cent of
those who had bought tickets were using direct debit and the average
expenditure was Pounds 500.
I told Mr Cornes about my surplus tickets and then had a brainwave. I'd read
in the small print that 'all tickets will be refundable up until 30 June
1995, subject to a Pounds 3 per ticket administration fee'. I would keep the
12 tickets I wanted and return my 10 spares for a refund. The administration
fee was annoying but I would offload the tickets legitimately and get my
cash back.
'We've thought of that,' Mr Cornes said. 'Our computer is very
sophisticated. If it sees that you're trying to return tickets that
qualified you for final tickets, it will invalidate your final tickets.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / Cola war hots up as Safeway launches own-label drink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Safeway, Britain's third-biggest food retailer, is joining the cola war with
the launch of an own-label drink called Safeway Select, putting further
pressure on brand leaders Coca-Cola and Pepsi.
Safeway's product, on sale in all its stores from today, follows the launch
of Classic Cola by J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest supermarket group, and of
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Cola.
The launch throws Britain's three leading superstore chains into a battle,
since Virgin has signed a six-month exclusive distribution deal with Tesco.
All three products are made by the same manufacturer, the Canadian soft
drinks company Cott, but each claims to have its own unique formulation with
which to attack the UK cola market, said by Safeway to be worth Pounds 1.3bn
a year.
Safeway was approached by Cott soon after the launch of Sainsbury's Classic,
with a blend that Cott developed for Safeway of the US - which owned the UK
company before selling it to Argyll group in 1987.
Mr Roger Partington, Safeway's marketing director, said: 'Safeway Select
poses a new challenge to Coke and Pepsi, which were unrivalled in the UK
cola market until the arrival of the new wave of own-brand colas this year.'
The three-way cola battle starts as the leading food retailers continue to
compete fiercely on basic food prices. According to the latest pricing
survey by Verdict, the retail research group, the average price of a basket
of 40 everyday items in superstores has fallen 17.6 per cent over two years.
The gap between the superstore and discounter averages has closed from
Pounds 4.12 - 12 per cent - to Pounds 1.61 - 5 per cent. The most expensive
superstore chain this month was Safeway, at Pounds 33.88, but the most
expensive group overall was a discounter, First Discount, operated by
Central Midlands Co-operative Society, at Pounds 37.09. The cheapest
superstore chain was Asda at Pounds 30.60, and the cheapest discounter
Scotland's Shoprite at Pounds 27.10.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Heseltine attempts to rescue mail sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has launched a
last-ditch effort to rescue his proposed sale of a majority of the Royal
Mail before a cabinet decision this week on whether to drop the
privatisation.
With a dozen Tory MPs publicly committed to opposing the sale of 51 per cent
of the Royal Mail Mr Heseltine was said to be considering a range of
possible compromises to 'buy off' the rebels.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is also determined that the sale should
go ahead.
The two main cabinet supporters of privatisation will seek to persuade Mr
John Major that at least some of the Tory opponents could be persuaded to
support a sale if stronger guarantees were given on the future of small post
offices.
But there were also suggestions among Tory MPs that, as a fall-back
position, Mr Heseltine was ready to consider legislating initially for the
sale of a minority stake or for a majority sale phased over a number of
years.
The Treasury, however, remains strongly opposed to the idea that the Post
Office be given much greater freedom in the public sector. Mr Clarke has
said that such a move would significantly undermine the present rules for
public borrowing.
Mr Heseltine is claiming the support of a majority of ministers in the
cabinet. The principal internal opposition remains that of the government's
parliamentary business managers. Mr Major is said to be 'wavering' over the
issue but to be less than enthusiastic about a confrontation with his own
back benchers.
Two of the leading opponents - Mr Nicholas Winterton and Mr Robert Hicks -
yesterday repeated their determination to oppose a sale.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Airlines hit at levy on departures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The introduction tomorrow of an airport departure tax in Britain was
attacked yesterday by the International Air Transport Association as an
example of government taxation policies undermining the recovery of the
airline industry.
Mr Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the trade organisation that
represents more than 200 international airlines, criticised the tax in his
annual report, prepared for the association's annual meeting in Mexico City
today.
Mr Jeanniot said that the Pounds 325m the UK levy would raise would go
directly to the Treasury. 'Taxes simply increase airline costs at a time
when consumers are demanding lower fares,' he said.
The association said the industry had lost Dollars 4.1bn (Pounds 2.6bn) on
international scheduled services alone last year and had losses for the past
four years totalling Dollars 15.6bn.
But things were improving, with traffic growing more quickly than capacity.
Mr Jeanniot said airlines were expected to show a modest profit on
international scheduled services of about Dollars 1bn this year. But he
warned that 'profitability of Dollars 1bn would represent less than 1 per
cent of turnover against a steady requirement for 5 to 6 per cent.'
The tax has been attacked by UK airlines, which say that it will distort
competition because it does not apply to other forms of transport.
It has caused problems for airlines because of confusion about the rate to
be charged for different European countries.
The tax involves a levy of Pounds 5 for travel to European destinations and
Pounds 10 to other international destinations. Airlines expected the Pounds
5 levy to apply only to European Union member states, however, and have been
charging Pounds 10 for travel after November 1 to European destinations
outside the EU.
But the tax for all European destinations has now been set at Pounds 5, and
airlines will be refunding passengers who have been overcharged when they
check-in.
A British Airways official said: 'This is causing us a big headache.'
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, has said that revenues from the new tax
should be ploughed back into improving UK aviation infrastructure.
The government has countered that the UK was one of the few remaining
countries which did not levy an airport departure tax.

FT  31 OCT 94 / The Mark Thatcher Affair: Harrovian Arthur Daley with a
famous mum - The son of the former prime minister tells William Lewis he is
not the seriously wealthy fixer the media claim him to be
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The image of Mark Thatcher in newspapers and on television is of an
extraordinarily wealthy arms industry fixer who shamelessly exploited his
position as the only son of the world's most powerful woman in the 1980s to
amass a reputed fortune of Pounds 40m.
It is an image created by rumour and speculation, however, rather than by
hard fact. It has never been dispelled in part because Mr Thatcher has
refused to comment in detail on the allegations.
To ascertain the true picture, the Financial Times has scoured pages of
company filings and court documents in the US and UK. His close business
associates have been interviewed, including some who have fallen out with
him. For the first time in many years Mr Thatcher made himself available for
a lengthy interview on his affairs.
What emerges is a subtly different picture. There can be little doubt that
he exploited his mother's connections, although he insists that everything
he did would have been achievable even if his mother had never become prime
minister.
With continuing speculation about why he was mixing in defence industry
circles at the time of the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah arms contract between the
UK and Saudi Arabia, the question of the propriety of his behaviour as the
then premier's son remains open.
But the tales of his fabulous wealth seem a long way from the truth. Far
from being a super-rich Mr Big of the arms world, Mr Thatcher appears to be
a relatively small-time wheeler-dealer, a sort of Harrovian Arthur Daley
with a famous mum, who has attempted investments in a wide range of
industries with limited financial success.
In Texas, where he lives with his American wife and two children, Mr
Thatcher remains an enthusiastic follower of his mother's free-market
entrepreneurial philosophy and still hopes to join the ranks of the
fabulously wealthy one day.
As for his current net worth, he confirms that it lies between Pounds 3m and
Pounds 5m. That is a highly plausible figure, on the basis of the value of
his homes in Houston and London and details compiled by the Financial Times
of his business interests and lifestyle.
Mr Thatcher himself points to his seven-year-old BMW and denies reports that
he employs a butler to travel with him.
Mr Thatcher said: 'This whole idea that I have had tremendous success is
just a myth. If I had tremendous success I would not be running around
trying to do the things that I am doing. I would be sitting on my own
private island in the South Pacific, but I am not.'
Certain questions remain regarding the exact source of the more modest
wealth to which he admits.
It may also be in his interest to understate his net worth at the moment,
due to widespread reports that his wife Diane is seeking a potentially
costly divorce settlement. Mr Thatcher denied this: 'No divorce, and any
speculation of it is just fanciful.'
Nevertheless there is little evidence to support claims that he has made
significant profits from the US business investments he has developed since
1987.
Conservative party officials suggested that they were the source of a
multi-million pound fortune. Instead his US business experience has been
coloured by a series of bitter boardroom fights and at least one big legal
case.
What was probably his first significant deal in the US was partly funded by
his mother's closest business supporters. It has emerged from court
documents in a case involving Mr Thatcher that Hanson, the UK quoted
conglomerate, and Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, were
co-investors with him in a Dallas-based home security company, Emergency
Networks.
Hanson has given more than Pounds 500,000 to the Conservative party since
1987 and Mr Li has also donated substantial sums.
The deal was carried out in 1987, the same year as his mother achieved her
third consecutive general election victory, making her one of the most
powerful politicians in the western world. Mr Thatcher helped put together a
consortium of wealthy individuals and companies to invest in Emergency
Networks in a complex business arrangement.
He did it with Mr Bruce Leadbetter, who was also his partner in the newly
formed Grantham Company - an investment vehicle named after the birthplace
of Mr Thatcher's mother. Mr Leadbetter is a long-time business associate of
Mr Jay Pritzker, one of the owners of the Hyatt Hotel chain.
Mr Thatcher described his role in putting the consortium together: 'Bruce
and I sat down and worked out what we wanted to raise and wrote out a list
of people and got on airplanes.'
They needed to find Dollars 1.5m, which Mr Thatcher said 'is a very
difficult number to raise because it's a lot of money'.
He said: 'You can run around the golf club and raise a hundred grand - you
can raise money from your dentist, accountant, a few friends and come up
with a hundred grand.
'Between one and a half and five million is the most difficult because no
institution will look at anything where the minimum investment is less than
five, they just can't afford to do it.'
Among those who did agree to invest as limited partners in Xpart, an
investment vehicle set up to buy more than 50 per cent of the share capital
of Emergency Networks, were some of the biggest names in US finance and
political circles.
A US subsidiary of the UK conglomerate Hanson and Mr Li each paid Dollars
100,000 for an Xpart stake giving them each 3 per cent of Emergency
Networks. Others who invested were Mr Bruce Babbit, now US interior
secretary, Mr Pritzker, and Mr Joe Refsnes from Rauscher Pierce and Refsnes,
the Dallas-based investment bank.
Mr Thatcher also invested in Emergency Networks through Xpart and became a
non-executive director of Emergency Networks. Mr Leadbetter, who became an
Emergency Networks director, was the sole director of a separate investment
vehicle which controlled the Xpart consortium's investment.
Mr Thatcher denies having exploited his mother's position to put the deal
together. He said the investment group was formed with a view to securing
future reinvestment for Emergency Networks from the same companies and
individuals.
More money was indeed raised later on, according to Hanson, when another
Dollars 10m was raised from shareholders. Hanson itself invested another
Dollars 300,000 in an interest-bearing debenture, of which all but Dollars
30,000 was subsequently repaid.
For a time Emergency Networks was successful. By the end of 1991 the company
had 36 sales facilities nationwide and was installing more than 10,000 home
security systems every month, grossing more than Dollars 90m a year.
Mr Thatcher's financial share in this success was limited. He says that his
shareholding in Emergency Networks never rose above 5 per cent and in 1990
he sold out for an undisclosed sum to Mr David Wallace, currently his
closest business associate and a former treasurer of Lady Thatcher's
fund-raising organisation, the Thatcher Foundation.
Grantham, the company jointly owned by Mr Thatcher and Mr Leadbetter, had a
management service agreement with Emergency Networks. It was Grantham's main
business from 1987 to 1989.
According to Mr Wallace, who was a paid member of staff at Grantham during
this period, the company was also active in looking for investment deals in
a range of industries including a record distribution company, two printing
companies including one in Mexico, and a real estate development in
Colorado. None of these yielded any substantial returns.
Having sold his Emergency Networks shareholding, Mr Thatcher remained on the
board of Emergency Networks and in January 1992 Mr Thatcher and Mr Wallace
agreed to provide a Dollars 1.1m loan to the company, which had hit
financial difficulties a year earlier. They did this by participating in a
total Dollars 27.5m loan made to Emergency Networks by EDS, the computer
services subsidiary of General Motors.
It turned out to be a wasted effort as later that year, on September 15
1992, Emergency Network filed for protection from its creditors under
Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code. It is now undergoing Chapter 7
proceedings in Dallas, the equivalent of liquidation in the UK.
By the time of its collapse Mr Thatcher was no longer officially connected
with the company, having been dismissed from the board in July 1992,
according to Mr Thatcher himself. His removal, with Mr Wallace and other
directors, followed a dispute with Mr Leadbetter.
Mr Thatcher blames the falling out on the close relationship Mr Leadbetter
had with EDS, Emergency Networks' main lender, while also acting as a
director of Emergency Networks.
An Emergency Networks board meeting was called to discuss the issue, but
five days before it was due to meet Mr Thatcher and the other directors were
dismissed by Mr Leadbetter. He was able to do this through his control of
the Xpart investment consortium.
But Mr Thatcher refused to walk away. He and Mr Wallace were still owed
Dollars 1.1m and they began legal proceedings against EDS last June in
Houston to get the money back.
According to Mr Wallace the legal fight lasted just one week as EDS agreed
to a secret out-of-court settlement.
Mr Thatcher said: 'I did make money out of Emergency Networks. I made in
percentage terms a reasonable return on my investment.' But he refused to
discuss the terms of the settlement with EDS.
Hanson was not so lucky. It lost Dollars 130,000 when Emergency Networks
collapsed, although Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, believes most
of that may still be recovered.
In 1990 the Grantham company which Mr Thatcher had formed with Mr Leadbetter
was superseded by a second investment company, also called Grantham, half
owned by Mr Thatcher and Mr Wallace through their respective companies -
Bomark Inc and Birmingham Investments.
From its formation the new Grantham company looked at a number of
investments in a range of industries as the first Grantham company had done.
It was not until the end of 1992 that it took on its first significant
management role - in the Ameristar Fuels group, a Dallas-based aircraft fuel
organisation which had been set up in June 1990 to sell jet fuel to
airlines.
Mr Thatcher took a low profile but played a significant role in the company,
helping Mr Wallace become a leading shareholder and director. Mr Thatcher's
most direct involvement was through the management agreement the new
Grantham company signed with Ameristar in October 1992. Through this
Grantham was paid Dollars 23,000 a month by Ameristar.
At the beginning of 1993 Mr Wallace became a 20 per cent shareholder in the
Ameristar group, later raising his stake to a controlling 50 per cent. Mr
Wallace's estimated Dollars 2.5m investment was funded partly by Mr
Thatcher, partly by his own personal funds, and partly by a loan from a
mysterious Jersey-registered company called Diversified Capital which Mr
Thatcher introduced him to.
Although not a director of Ameristar, Mr Thatcher attended a number of board
meetings and had an office at the company's headquarters.
Mr Thatcher plays down the extent of his involvement in Ameristar, but
details of it are likely to be at the centre of a law suit to be filed next
month by Mr Jay Laughlin, a former Ameristar shareholder.
He is intending to add Mr Thatcher as a defendant to a legal petition which
already includes Mr Wallace. Mr Laughlin will allege that Mr Thatcher and Mr
Wallace conspired to take control of Ameristar and that Mr Wallace was just
a 'front man' for Mr Thatcher.
Mr Laughlin claims Mr Wallace persuaded him to cede control of the company
last year on the ground that additional investment was required. Mr Laughlin
says he was then squeezed out completely last January. Ameristar Fuels
Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in August and has a
deficit of liabilities over assets of more than Dollars 6m.
Mr Laughlin's lawyer is considering bringing the lawsuit against Mr Thatcher
under the civil clauses of America's anti-racketeering legislation which
could result in Mr Thatcher having to pay Dollars 3m personal damages.
Mr Wallace and Mr Thatcher deny Mr Laughlin's allegations and say they will
be contesting any action.
Meanwhile, the search for riches goes on. Mr Thatcher has two big business
ventures at the moment, one a substantial property development in Dallas and
the other in Azerbaijan, the former Soviet republic, which is thought to
partly involve the provision of high-quality paper.
Baroness Thatcher visited Azerbaijan two years ago but Mr Thatcher explained
that his interest started when an American woman familiar with Azerbaijan
walked into his office.
Mr Thatcher said: 'She walks in one day and says: 'Mark there are some
incredible opportunities down there, why don't we have a look at it?' I
thought I need this like a hole in the head, but I gave her a very modest
budget, about Pounds 20,000, and said: 'Fine, go and have a look around.'
'Now we have got a very modest but quite profitable business down there.
From a standing start we have covered all our expenses and I'm comfortable,'
he said.
Mr Thatcher said he was unlikely to 'make millions' out of it 'because the
money's not down there'. But, he added, 'it is bloody interesting'.

FT  31 OCT 94 / The Mark Thatcher Affair: Dabbler in a variety of sectors -
His career

The little bit of help which Mr Mark Thatcher received in his US investment
business from his mother's corporate friends is strikingly reminiscent of
the affair which first drew attention to his business career. This was his
role as a consultant more than a decade ago working for Cementation.
Cementation's owner, Trafalgar House - like Hanson and Mr Li - is another
substantial Conservative party donor. There was a political storm when his
role for Cementation was disclosed, because Oman awarded the company a
contract for building a university at about the same time as his mother
visited the country.
Mr Thatcher was at that period working with his friend Mr Stephen Tipping, a
former racing driver, in a consultancy company called Monteagle
International.
Mr Tipping said this week that his business dealings with Mr Thatcher ceased
in 1985, when Monteagle went into voluntary liquidation, although he
remained a friend of the former prime minister's son.
One of Mr Thatcher's most visible business ventures was in Hong Kong in the
1980s, where he was paid to appear in television commercials for whisky and
clothes. Mr Thatcher had become something of an international celebrity in
his alternative career as rally driver, having got lost in the Sahara desert
for six days.
He has also dabbled in a variety of sectors as a 'consultant' or middleman
with mixed results. Mr Leon Walger, an Argentine businessman, this week
talked of his 'frivolous business relationship' with Mr Thatcher.
Mr Walger said: 'We wanted to sell electrical power stations to Peru and
there was a project in Paraguay to build a railway from Asuncion to
Paranagua port in Brazil for the shipment of soya.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / The Mark Thatcher Affair: Arms-payoff facts prove scarce -
Al Yamamah deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, WILLIAM LEWIS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Thatcher's millions from Saudi defence deal' is the UK journalistic
equivalent of 'Who shot Kennedy?'.
An army of journalists has investigated the long-running allegation that Mr
Thatcher exploited his position as the then prime minister's son to take a
fat commission on the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah military contract between Saudi
Arabia and the UK.
A consensus has developed among the many Thatcher conspiracy theorists that
he was paid Dollars 20m.
Hard facts are scarce, however. There is one piece of documentary evidence,
authenticated as part of a US court case, that he played some role in the
deal. This is a 1989 memorandum written by a US defence company executive,
purporting to be an account of the executive's conversation with an employee
of the US embassy in Riyadh about Saudi defence sales.
It contains the tantalising but obscure sentence: 'This 4 bil US was
menioned in connection with M. Thather's (sic) son.'
A rather more comprehensible account of his alleged role in defence sales is
contained in another company's memorandum, although this has never been
authenticated. It was passed by Mr Jeffrey Rooker, the Labour MP, to Downing
Street for further investigation - but the government has never commented on
its veracity.
Mr Howard Teicher, an adviser to the US National Security Council during the
Reagan presidency, insisted two years ago that he saw intelligence and
diplomatic dispatches confirming Mr Thatcher's involvement in Al Yamamah.
More recently The Sunday Times newspaper reproduced transcripts of alleged
conversations between arms dealers and agents of the Saudi royal family
which appeared to confirm that Mr Thatcher had acted as an agent in that
deal.
The Sunday Times has, however, disclosed that it does not possess the
original tapes - and anyway the transcript gives no detail of payments to Mr
Thatcher. Officials and politicians have privately confirmed that in the
mid-1980s Mr Thatcher was mixing in the circles of those who were involved
in the negotiations - so the journalistic quest for this holy grail of
alleged sleaze will go on.
For his part Mr Thatcher says he is a friend of Mr Wafic Said, the
Syrian-born financier who acted as go-between for the British negotiators on
Al Yamamah.
But he insists that the relationship with Mr Said is rooted in the close
friendship between his wife, Diane, and Mr Said's wife, Rosemary.
Mr Thatcher said: 'Merely because I know this man does not mean to say that
he is going to pay me Pounds 12m because I am a nice guy.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / Companies hit by lawsuits over sackings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A spate of employment discrimination lawsuits is hitting companies with US
operations in the wake of widespread corporate 'downsizing'. While the
hiring practices of US companies have long been scrutinised for bias,
businesses increasingly face potential charges of violations of US fair
employment laws for the manner in which they shed workers.
Statistical analyses of the number of workers fired, according to their
race, sex and age are now essential defensive moves, according to legal
experts. Increasingly, US companies are also requiring employees to agree to
settle any dispute they may have with their employer through arbitration.
The latter move is aimed at avoiding potentially large damage awards such as
the Dollars 89.5m award handed down last week by a Los Angeles jury against
Hughes Aircraft, a General Motors subsidiary. In the case, which involves
two former employees of Hughes - one white and one black - the company has
been found to have violated fair employment laws.
Hughes called the jury verdict 'irrational, irresponsible and outrageous'.
The company said it would move to have the jury award reduced or overturned
by the judge or by a higher court.
Legal experts said that the award would almost certainly be substantially
reduced. The case has, however, sent a chilling message to employers.
The award comes amid a rash of discrimination and harassment suits. In
another high profile case, the US Labor Department, which is supposed to be
a watchdog against workplace discrimination, agreed to pay an estimated
Dollars 4.9m to settle a suit that accused the agency of discrimination
against its own black employees.
Businesses complain that despite their efforts to eliminate bias in the
workplace, increasingly restrictive laws make it very difficult to comply.
US employment laws prohibit many practices that are common in Europe and
Asia. When interviewing prospective employees, for example, US employers are
precluded from seeking information about the age, health or national origin
of the applicant.
Since the Americans with Disabilities Act became law in mid-1992, requiring
businesses to make provision for workers who are physically or mentally
disabled, for example, some 27,000 claims have been filed with the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Franco-Canadian proposal on new OECD chief under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The search for a new secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development is again in disarray, with several new options
being discussed by the 25 member countries of the Paris-based research body.
The US and Japan are understood to have rejected a compromise put forward by
France and Canada in recent weeks to break the long impasse between their
respective candidates, Mr Jean-Claude Paye and Mr Donald Johnston.
Under this proposal, Mr Paye, the outgoing secretary-general who has already
served two terms, would be reinstated for another two years, to be followed
by a full five-year term for Mr Johnston.
The US, which insists the OECD post should be filled by a non-European, has
rejected any extension of Mr Paye's term. Japan is said to be unhappy that
the Franco-Canadian plan would tie up the job for seven years. France and
Canada are banking on a compromise which, for in-stance, might allow Mr Paye
to serve one year, and Mr Johnston four.
Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, has telephoned the heads of
several other OECD governments to revive support for Mr Johnston, whose
chances were fading until the Canadians put forward the 'two-plus-five'
formula to French officials earlier this month.
However, one European official predicted that the impasse over the OECD job
may not be broken until a choice is made for secretary-general of the new
World Trade Organisation, which is due to come into being on January 1. The
three contenders for the WTO job are Mexico's President Carlos Salinas, Mr
Renato Ruggiero of Italy, and Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister.
Mr Salinas currently appears to be the WTO front-runner. But some European
governments have indicated that they will not accept North Americans in both
the WTO and OECD jobs. One scenario being discussed is that, if the WTO goes
to Mr Salinas, Mr Ruggiero may end up at the OECD.
While obstacles facing Mr Paye and Mr Johnston have again opened the way for
a third candidate, the UK is understood no longer to be pressing the
candidacy of Lord Lawson, former chancellor of the exchequer.

Mr Lawrence Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor, said at the weekend

reports from Detroit.
He told reporters before addressing a conference on housing: 'I don't see
anything in my crystal ball to suggest a slowdown.'
Data released on Friday showed that GDP rose 3.4 per cent in the third
quarter, which MrLindsey noted was a faster rise than most people had
expected.

FT  31 OCT 94 / White House shots underscore case for gun curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration yesterday seized on Saturday's shooting at the
west wing of the White House to underscore its arguments that President Bill
Clinton was right to have pushed for bans on semi-automatic assault weapons.
Mr George Stephanopolous, the senior presidential adviser, noted that Mr
Clinton had 'talked all year' about the need to ban such guns and that the
Chinese-made weapon was bought on the day the president signed into law the
crime bill that included bans on some types of assault weapons.
The shooting attack on a clear Saturday afternoon was the second apparent
assault on the White House in six weeks and has increased concerns about
presidential security. Last month a pilot with a history of mental
instability was killed after crashing a small aircraft on the White House
lawns.
The weekend attacker, who was tackled by bystanders before being arrested,
has been identified as Francisco Martin Duran, a hotel worker from Colorado
Springs. He had been dishonourably discharged from the army in 1991 after
being convicted of felony and assault. His camper van parked near the White
House was emblazoned with pro-gun stickers.
Mr Duran was indicted on two counts yesterday - damaging government property
and, because of his criminal record, illegal possession of a fire-arm. A
spokesman for the secret service said the charge of attempting to
assassinate the president was also being considered.
Mr Stephanopoulos said that Mr Lloyd Bensten, the treasury secretary whose
jurisdiction includes the secret service, would conduct a complete
investigation into all aspects of White House security, with a final report
in mid-January.
The secret service, whose duty is to protect the president, has long wanted
to close Pennsylvania Avenue, the broad street outside the north face of the
White House, to vehicular and even pedestrian traffic.
Mr Clinton, as Mr Stephanopoulos said yesterday, has been opposed to such
curbs on the grounds that the White House is 'the people's house' and
should, within reason, be accessible to the public.
The president himself was watching a televised college football game in the
family quarters as the 22 shots were fired, shattering windows in the White
House press room but hurting no one.
He had returned on Saturday morning from a trip to the Middle East in which
security considerations were very evident. He made light of the incident,
quipping that he was glad 'to be back in the safety and security of the

FT  31 OCT 94 / US warns Japan on economic squabbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US, seeking to extract trade concessions from Japan, has issued a fresh
warning to Tokyo underscoring the risks of continued economic squabbling,
Reuter reports from Washington.
Washington has been negotiating an agreement to open up Japan's glass sector
and has sought an accord on vehicles and parts - the single biggest
component of the US trade deficit with Japan. But the talks have proved
tough going.
Should no trade deal emerge in the glass sector by today, according to top
officials in the Clinton administration, the allies would find themselves in
'a difficult situation'. As for cars: 'It is essential that we reach
agreement'.
The warning was directed to Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japanese trade minister,
in a letter dated October 25 from Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative,
and Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary. A copy of the letter, whose existence
was first reported in a Japanese newspaper on Friday, was obtained by
Reuters.
'It was a direct letter. . . that will hopefully provide some results,' Mr
Brown told US public television. 'We're very anxious to re-engage the
Japanese as soon as possible.'
Mr Kantor and Mr Brown wrote to Mr Hashimoto in reply to two letters he had
sent them earlier this month, thanking the Tokyo trade minister for his
'candid comments'. Officials said Mr Hashimoto had complained about a recent
speech by Mr Jeffrey Garten, commerce undersecretary and the chief US
negotiator on cars, in which he had outlined the advantages of
private-sector co-operation.
'The Japanese took umbrage with that speech. This letter was in response,'
said one official. No reply to the latest US letter had been received by the
weekend, another said.
But the US side made clear that a long-sought deal on automotive trade -
which accounts for two-thirds of the Dollars 60bn bilateral imbalance  - was
vital to improved relations. 'It is essential that we reach agreement,' they
wrote. As for glass, under negotiation this week, Mr Kantor and Mr Brown
both voiced 'concern at the pace of discussions in Tokyo. There are many
issues left to resolve before the end of the month.'
The two sides struck an agreement in principle on October 1 to open Japan's
Dollars 4.5bn flat glass market and pledged to finalise the accord in 30
days.
'We cannot conclude an agreement that does not result in substantial opening
of the glass distribution system. Failure to reach an agreement by the end
of the month would create a difficult situation,' Mr Kantor and Mr Brown
said.
They did not spell out what action the US team might take should no accord
emerge and reiterated that the Clinton administration was not seeking
'numerical targets' over glass.

FT  31 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Ballot initiatives stir
up the voters - The midterm polls' crop of state referendums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Voter turnout in the US midterm polls on November 8 is expected to be low,
in the absence of a high-profile presidential election, but in some states
controversial referendum proposals on the ballot paper are expected to lure
people to vote.
Most controversial of all is California's Proposition 187, which would ban
illegal immigrants from receiving public education or social services. The
proposal, which Justice Department officials say they believe to be
unconstitutional, has sharply divided the candidates in California's
elections. More people say they are being drawn to the ballot box primarily
by Proposition 187 than by the elections for governor and senator combined.
But California's anti-immigration measure is a rarity among the proposals on
the ballot in the 24 states that allow legislation by plebiscite. Topping
the ballot paper in other states are traditional measures on taxation, term
limits and gambling.
In the tax field, Florida, Missouri, Montana and Oregon are proposing to
follow the example of Colorado and require voter approval for all future tax
increases. Voters in all of these except Missouri will also decide on a
separate measure requiring a two thirds majority vote for tax increases, as
will Nevada voters.
Oregon also has a sweeping proposal on the ballot which would repeal most
state and local taxes, including the state income tax and local property
taxes, and replace them with a 2 per cent 'equal tax' similar to a value
added tax. Standard &amp; Poors, the credit rating agency, said it would have to
review Oregon's debt if the measure passes.
Massachusetts, meanwhile, will vote on an alteration to the state
constitution that would permit a graduated income tax. California proposes
an additional tax of 4 cents a gallon on petrol, while South Dakota will
vote on a measure slashing property taxes, similar to California's
Proposition 13 in 1978.
California also has a number of tax measures, among them a payroll tax and a
tobacco tax, included in a proposal to set up a statewide single payer
health system similar to Canada's. But after the defeat of the Clinton
administration's efforts to carry out less radical reform of the health care
system at the national level, the measure is expected to be heavily
defeated. But higher tobacco taxes to fund additional health services are
thought to stand a better chance in Arizona and Colorado.
California will take a different approach to smoking in Proposition 188,
which was put on the ballot by a group called Californians for Statewide
Smoking Restrictions. Despite its name, this group is heavily financed by
Philip Morris, the tobacco company. The proposal would, in fact, abolish the
many tough anti-smoking ordinances passed by local governments in California
and replace them with much weaker statewide controls.
Also attracting considerable attention is Arizona's Proposition 300, which
would require the state to assess the costs to the private sector of any
regulation it imposed. Supporters say the measure merely implements the
guarantee in the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution that private
property may not be taken by the government without compensation. But it is
hotly opposed by environmentalists, which fear it will help lawsuits against
environmental regulations.
Limits on the number of terms elected politicians may serve remain a popular
ballot initiative, appearing in at least eight states. In Colorado, voters
will get a second bite at the cherry with a proposal to halve the number of
consecutive terms a member of the US House of Representatives could serve
from six to three.
Term limits on federal office-holders, however, remain under a
constitutional cloud. The US Supreme Court is due to decide on their
legality this session.
Proposals to authorise gambling are another staple of the ballot initiative
process. This time, voters in North Dakota, South Dakota and New Mexico will
get a chance to approve state lotteries. In Florida, Arkansas, Rhode Island
and Wyoming, casinos will be up for approval. Missouri, which already allows
river-boat gambling on games of skill, is asking voters whether to allow
games of chance, which would open up the lucrative slot machine market.
In Colorado, a measure to allow slot machines at airports is on the ballot,
while Minnesota is asking for approval of off track betting on horse races.
Crime is a popular ballot measure this year, with proposals mandating long
prison sentences up for approval in Oregon and Colorado, and a victims'
rights measure in Alaska. Georgia voters will consider a constitutional
amendment providing mandatory life sentences for a second violent felony,
while Californians will vote on a 'three strikes and out' proposal imposing
mandatory life sentences for a third violent felony. The proposal largely
duplicates an existing law passed by the state legislature, but if approved
by voters on November 8 it will be much harder to repeal in the future.

FT  31 OCT 94 / N Korea to receive Japan delegation
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday agreed to an official visit by the three parties of
Japan's coalition government, paving the way for the resumption of an
official dialogue between the two neighbours, writes William Dawkins in
Tokyo.
The accord, announced by Mr Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of Japan's
Liberal Democratic Party, is part of the general unfreezing in relations
brought about by the recent North Korea-US deal. Under that accord,
Pyongyang agreed to accept full international inspections of its nuclear
facilities in return for improved US ties and aid to replace its graphite
plants - which can produce weapons grade plutonium - with safer light water
reactors.
The Japanese delegation, to arrive some time in November, will discuss
Japanese participation in the conversion of North Korea's nuclear plants and
the possible resumption of talks, broken off two years ago, on opening
diplomatic relations.
Of the Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.77bn) required to instal light water reactors
in North Korea, Japan is expected to contribute up to 20 per cent, with 55
per cent from South Korea, and the balance from the five members of the UN
Security Council, plus Canada, Australia and Germany.
However, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, Japan's finance minister would like to see
clear European backing for the project before going ahead. The North
Korean-Japan meeting testifies to the close ties maintained with Pyongyang
by the other two members of the coalition, the left-wing Social Democratic
Party and the New Harbinger Party, a centre-left splinter group. Japan has
shown more interest in Asian affairs since the arrival of the current
government in June under Mr Tomiichi Murayama, its Socialist and pro-Asian
prime minister.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Hopes rise for Burma dialogue: New meeting with democracy
campaigner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A second meeting between Burma's military rulers and Ms Aung San Suu Kyi,
the detained pro-democracy campaigner, sharply raised hopes at the weekend
that the junta and its opponents would soon start negotiating a political
settlement after years of violence and human rights abuses.
Details of the meeting are scarce. Lt-Gen Khin Nyunt, the powerful head of
military intelligence and 'Secretary One' of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (Slorc) - as the junta calls itself - met Ms Suu Kyi in
the company of two other generals for three hours on Friday morning.
Unlike the first such meeting on September 20, news of the latest encounter
at an army guest house in Rangoon was given pride of place in the official
media.
Ms Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest at her Rangoon home for more
than five years, was shown smiling and chatting with the generals in the
lead item on the television news, and three photographs appeared on the
front page of the New Light of Myanmar (Burma) newspaper.
Burmese citizens, who voted overwhelmingly for Ms Suu Kyi's National League
for Democracy in a 1990 election whose results were ignored by the armed
forces, were delighted but baffled.
An official statement said merely that the discussions were 'frank and
cordial', that they covered Burma's political and economic situation,
including reforms being implemented by the Slorc, and examined 'steps that
should be taken with a view to the long-term welfare of the nation'.
No-one expects the talks to be easy. Indeed some Burmese, including
government officials, dismiss the discussions as a ploy by the armed forces
to improve their international image and head off a resolution in the UN
general assembly condemning Burmese human rights abuses.
Such suspicions are reinforced by events which attract less publicity than
the meetings with Ms Suu Kyi.
Earlier this month, for example, five of her fellow-dissidents were quietly
sentenced to between seven and 15 years in jail on a variety of charges
including spreading information 'damaging to the state'.
'The Slorc is just using the meetings to get a breathing space in the
international community,' said one Burmese businessman. 'They don't want to
share power or give any role to Aung San Suu Kyi in creating our country's
future.'
Others believe the meetings represent a genuine desire to negotiate on the
part of the junta - Ms Suu Kyi herself has always said she is willing to
talk - although they accept that the two sides remain far apart.
'The only common ground, perhaps, is a desire for reconciliation,' said one
Rangoon-based diplomat.
Ms Suu Kyi is aware of the sensitivities of the army and has gone out of her
way to say she is not anti-military; her father Aung San was the
Japanese-trained general who led Burma to the brink of independence from
Britain in the 1940s.
But she insists on the need for democracy and has called the National
Convention - a Slorc-dominated conference that is drawing up a new
constitution designed to ensure military control of future governments - 'a
farce'.
Slorc members, on the other hand, demand continued military influence in
politics.
Some hardliners, such as Gen Tun Kyi, the trade minister and former Mandalay
commander who once called Ms Suu Kyi 'an ant to be swept off the road', are
said to oppose the whole idea of negotiations.
But the Slorc needs to be seen to be negotiating in good faith while it
seeks the help of foreign investors and donors.
An economic recovery in the last couple of years has begun to repair the
damage caused by the army's 'Burmese Way to Socialism' after it took power
in 1962.
Even Singaporean and Thai investors sympathetic to the junta say they would
like to see Ms Suu Kyi released, while the western nations and Japan want to
profit from the economic growth in this country of 43m people at the same
time as upholding their human rights principles; Mr Thomas Hubbard, US
deputy assistant secretary of state for east Asia, is to visit Burma this
week after a long period of frosty relations between the two countries.
As one Burmese dissident noted last week, the increasingly confident junta
is having some success in changing the international agenda.
Foreign governments used to demand the instant release of Ms Suu Kyi and the
immediate transfer of power to the democratically-elected government; now
they want a 'meaningful dialogue' and moves towards democracy.
The hard task facing the Slorc and Ms Suu Kyi is to agree on a definition of
democracy. Brig-Gen Kyaw Ba, a member of the 21-man Slorc, commenting on the
Suu Kyi-Slorc talks in an interview on Friday, declared that Burma already
enjoyed freedom. 'We have a democracy according to the Myanmar way,' he
said. 'Democracy must be a disciplined democracy. It must not be a rowdy
one.'
Ms Suu Kyi would have sighed at these words. At a meeting with a US
congressman in February, she said: 'Having imposed the Burmese Way to
Socialism on us for so many years, I now dread the Slorc wanting to impose
its idea of a Burmese Way to Democracy.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / China shows growing confidence abroad
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China's leaders begin a series of foreign missions this week in a virtually
unprecedented show of diplomatic zeal that underscores China's growing
self-confidence internationally.
China's official media yesterday described visits by the country's three
most senior leaders to neighbouring countries over the next two weeks as
part of a 'new diplomatic drive'.
Xinhua, the official news agency, said it was 'rare' for three top Chinese
officials to 'go abroad in quick succession'. It noted that the visits were
'mostly in the Asia-Pacific region'.
Premier Li Peng, who ranks number two in the standing committee of the
ruling Politburo, begins a five-day visit to South Korea today. He will be
the most senior Chinese official to visit Seoul since Beijing established
diplomatic ties with South Korea in 1992.
Mr Qiao Shi, chairman of the standing committee of the National People's
Congress, China's parliament, leaves later this week on a five-nation tour
of New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Fiji. Mr Qiao ranks three
in the politburo.
President Jiang Zemin, who also serves as general secretary of the Communist
party and chairman of the powerful Military Commission, will visit
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam between November 6 and 22. He
will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Indonesia in
mid-November.
Other senior Chinese officials who will be engaged this week in high level
diplomatic missions include vice-premier Li Lanqing who will visit
Washington to press China's case for admission to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Li, who is a former minister of foreign trade, will seek to counter US
misigivings about China's progress in meeting requirements for Gatt entry.
US trade officials say Beijing is still some distance from satisfying market
liberalisation requirements for Gatt accession.
Western officials in Beijing view China's diplomatic blitz as a sign of
growing self-confidence in the international arena. 'This indicates that
things are going their way on the diplomatic front,' said one.
The official noted that Beijing appears to have successfully neutralised the
worst of the international opprobrium that followed the June 1989 massacre
of pro-democracy protesters around Tiananmen Square.
'There are increasing signs that different countries are now prepared to put
human rights down the list of priorities when dealing with China,' he said.
The visits abroad by China's three top officials are the culmination of
perhaps the most active year of diplomatic activity in the history of the
People's Republic, beginning with a tour of Central Asia in April by Premier
Li Peng. Mr Li went abroad again in mid-year when he visited Austria,
Germany and Romania.
President Jiang went to Russia, Ukraine and France in September, and earlier
this month Mr Zhu Rongji, the senior vice premier in charge of the economy,
was in Madrid for the IMF-World Bank meeting.
Xinhua said Chinese leaders would 'try to alleviate fears of the so-called
'China threat'' in their discussions with regional counterparts.
'Chinese leaders are expected to explain China's position on the
establishment of a new political and economic order,' Xinhua said. 'They
will reassure their hosts that China has no intention of seeking hegemony.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / Moroccan sale oversubscribed seven times
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Morocco's largest privatisation passed one of its most important hurdles
last week when an issue on the Casablanca Stock Exchange representing 16 per
cent of the equity in the Societe Nationale d'Investissements (SNI) was
seven times oversubscribed.
The flotation forms part of the sale of 67 per cent of SNI under a programme
to shed state assets started in 1992.
In addition to the public shares offered on the stock exchange, a further 51
per cent of SNI's capital is being sold to institutional investors which
have been asked to bid for blocks of shares at a floor price of Dirham 325
per share (Pounds 23). Of this 35 per cent will go to a 'hard core' of
Moroccan institutional investors who must hold the shares for at least five
years, while 16 per cent will be sold to foreign and Moroccan institutions.
SNI is a holding company with stakes in 41 businesses ranging from cement to
food-processing. Three sectors dominate - cement accounts for 34 per cent of
SNI's assets, food processing and drinks another 34 per cent and financial
services for 12 per cent.
The exact value of SNI's assets is difficult to ascertain as many companies
in its portfolio are not publicly traded and the accounts of those that are
often not consolidated. But the minimum value of SNI's assets is estimated
at Pounds 172m, which makes the holding Morocco's fourth largest company in
terms of market value.
Since 1992, the state has sold Dirham3.072bn (Pounds 266m) worth of assets.
The privatisation of SNI will push this figure to Pounds 331m. A further
boost will come before the end of the year when the state expects to sell
part of its 50 per cent stake in Morocco's second largest bank, Banque
Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur and part of its 49 per cent shareholding in
Credit Immobilier et Hotelier, the real estate financing agency.
Direct foreign investment in Morocco has risen steadily since 1987 to Pounds
349m last year and is expected to top Pounds 616m this year. Trading volume
on the Casablanca stock exchange increased more than three-fold last year
and volume in 1994 is already well up on last year's figure. The 25 Share
Index set up by Casablanca Finance Group, an investment bank set up in 1992,
showed a 35 per cent increase last year; this year's increase is expected to
be even larger.

The Malaysian leader of an Islamic sect called deviationist by the

head of the Al Arqam sect, had been jailed without trial since early
September. Al Arqam, which claims more than 100,000 followers in Malaysia
and more overseas, was banned in August. Mr Ashaari recently appeared on TV
saying he regretted straying from the true path of Islam. But many Al Arqam
members say he was forced by police to make his confession. Malaysian
authorities say Mr Ashaari's release is conditional. It is believed he will
remain under house arrest.

Israel yesterday announced a further step in liberalising its currency. From
tomorrow Israelis going abroad on holiday will be free to take up to Dollars
7,000 in cash, instead of the present ceiling of Dollars 3,000. They will
also have unrestricted use of credit cards for buying goods and services,
though not for drawing cash. Previously, any credit card transactions were
subject to the Dollars 3,000 limit. A Bank of Israel spokesman acknowledged
that the change was mainly psychological. The average Israeli tourist drew
only Dollars 1,500 when travelling. But it would affect the climate and
enhance the sense of a free currency. Business travellers already enjoy a
ceiling of Dollars 9,000, which can be increased where justified.

Italy is expected to veto the opening of negotiations between the European
Union and Slovenia on an association agreement at a meeting of EU foreign
ministers in Luxembourg today. This follows Slovenian government repudiation
of an agreement reached two weeks ago at Aquileia in Italy between the
Italian and Slovenian foreign ministers. Mr Lojze Peterle, Slovenian foreign
minister and leader of the Christian Democrat party, is due to step down
today, having resigned in protest at what he considers a tendency of the
Liberal Democrat party, led by prime minister Janez Drnovsek, to monopolise
power. The Liberal Democrats objected to a clause in the Aquileia agreement
whereby Slovenia undertook to draw up a list of real estate formerly
belonging to Italian citizens and now in public ownership, with a view to
giving former owners or their heirs the right to buy it back.

French police yesterday arrested in Paris Mr Ferdinando Mach Di Palmstein, a
Swiss-born Italian businessmen who has been on the run from arrest warrants
issued by Milan anti-corruption magistrates for 18 months. He is one of two
key remaining businessmen on the magistrates' wanted list associated with Mr
Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader and prime minister.
At least five arrest warrants have been issued against Mr Mach Di Palmstein
on various charges of corruption since early 1993 by Milan and Rome
judiciaries. Earlier this month he was sent to trial with 43 other
politicians, officials and businessmen on charges relating to alleged misuse
of Italian overseas aid funds.

<TEXT>
A symbolic step in the reform of Japanese politics was completed yesterday
when the party that triggered the current upheavals disbanded itself to
prepare to merge with Opposition allies. The Japan New Party of former prime
minister Morihiro Hosokawa chose the occasion of its first national
convention since its birth in May 1992 to announce its disbandment. Mr
Hosokawa, a former member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, founded
the JNP out of repugnance for the complacency encouraged by the comfortable
links between the bureaucracy, politicians and business. That theme has
since become central to the political reform movement, and to the eight
other potential members of the new opposition party, who are expected to
follow the JNP's example and ritually close down over the next month or so.
The new party is expected to be created in December. Opposition parties are
now attempting to close ranks, in another attempt to put pressure on the LDP
and eventually push it out of power.

The Hong Kong government confirmed yesterday that a company owned by trading
house Jardine Matheson had won the contract to build a navy base for China
before the British colony reverts to Beijing's control in 1997. The
HKDollars 790m (Pounds 62.8m) colonial government contract to build the base
was awarded to Gammon Construction by the government's Central Tendering
Board, secretary for security Alistair Asprey said. Gammon is owned by
Jardine Matheson, Jardine Pacific and British-headquartered Trafalgar House,
in which Jardine group company Hongkong Land has a 25 per cent stake.
Jardine, which moved its group headquarters to Bermuda in the mid-1980s, has
been embroiled in a dispute with Beijing over its backing of democratic
reforms in the territory. 'The actual contract itself is a straightforward
Hong Kong government contract,' Mr Asprey said. China was not consulted, he
said, but added it would be consulted on its requirements for design of the
base.

<TEXT>
The European Commission is drawing up plans to open the market for ground
handling services at European airports, a move that could sharply reduce
airlines' costs. Action to force competition in airport services will tackle
the last significant element of air transport not in theory opened up to
competition when the single European market came into force two years ago.
The commission aims to present draft legislation to EU transport ministers
at a meeting next month.
Airlines argue that at many European airports, ground handling services are
controlled by monopoly suppliers. Air France, British Airways, KLM,
Lufthansa, SAS and Spanair, which have joined forces to support opening the
market, say the monopolies typically charge 30-50 per cent more than
suppliers who face competition at other airports. The services in question
cover passenger and baggage check-in, loading and unloading of baggage, mail
and cargo handling, aircraft cleaning, towing, refuelling and aircraft
maintenance.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Frelimo heads for Mozambique election victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MAPUTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mozambique last night seemed within reach of a lasting peace when the
country's former rebel leader indicated that he would accept the outcome of
the country's first multi-party elections, and would accept a post in a
government of national unity.
As early results in the three day election suggested a comfortable victory
for President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party, Mr Afonso Dhlakama,
head of Renamo said he would abide by the outcome if it were adjudged free
and fair.
Final results of the election, the final stage in the agreement signed in
1992 which ended the country's 16-year civil war, are not expected before
mid-November. Over 90 per cent of the estimated 6.4m electorate are thought
to have voted in an exercise which internal observers endorsed as
democratic.
Apparently conceding defeat, Mr Dhlakama said: 'We have to admit sometimes
you win, sometimes you lose. It (democracy) is like football. If the
elections are fair we will not contest them . We would accept and recognise
the results.'
He also called for an early meeting with President Joaquim Chissano: 'I am
prepared (to meet him) anytime so that we can discuss the future,' Mr
Dhlakama said. 'We want to build confidence with our brothers.' The Renamo
leader said he wanted to discuss with Mr Chissano ways to ensure a peaceful
transition after the elections. The president, while not ruling out a
government of national unity, has not so far displayed great enthusiasm for
the concept.
Some senior party members, however, are urging Mr Chissano to follow South
Africa's example. 'The way forward is a unity government - that way we will
avoid trouble by ensuring all Mozambicans are winners,' said Mr Alves Gomes,
an influential and long-standing Frelimo supporter.
'I know my party will win but I want it to work with other parties,' he
added. Frelimo is also coming under pressure from South African President
Nelson Mandela and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe to bring all main parties into
his government.

FT  31 OCT 94 / S Africa plans action on privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African government intends to press ahead with privatisation as
quickly as possible in an effort to raise new funds for its centrepiece
Reconstruction and Development Programme. At the same time it plans to cut
the size of the civil service and the salaries of top government officials,
writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
The speedy implementation of the first two proposals is regarded as crucial
if the government is to meet its goals of cutting the size of budget
deficit, currently at 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product. The third is a
largely symbolic action designed to improve the administration's public
image. The government has come under increasing pressure in recent months
over top officials' high salaries at a time when the country is being asked
to accept austerity programmes.
Making the announcement over the weekend, deputy president Thabo Mbeki,
standing in for President Nelson Mandela, said the plan represented a 'bold
and imaginative shift' in policy.
Under the plan the president and his two deputies will each take a 20 per
cent salary cut while national ministers, regional premiers and the heads of
the Senate and National Assembly will accept 10 per cent cuts. Further
increases will be limited to 5 per cent a year.
The proposals also call for the 1.2m-strong civil service to be cut to less
than 1m.

FT  31 OCT 94 / US, UK top drugs market growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and UK remain the fastest growing pharmaceuticals markets in the
world, but the gap is slowly being closed by other western European nations,
according to figures published yesterday.
Drug sales in the US for the first eight months of the year stood at Dollars
34bn (Pounds 21bn), 8 per cent higher than a year ago. This represents
modest growth in the US by recent historical standards and was matched only
by the UK where drug sales rose to Dollars 3.6bn, said IMS International,
the specialist market research company.
Both the UK and the US have been relatively lenient towards drugs companies.
Other countries have imposed sometimes draconian price controls on drugs in
an attempt to limit the growth in healthcare costs.
The world's second biggest market, Japan, saw sales rise only one per cent -
to Dollars 14.1bn - in the first eight months of 1994 compared with the same
period a year earlier. Drug sales growth in Japan averaged 6 per cent in
1993 but the government imposed widespread price cuts in April this year.
Italy has seen the sharpest turnaround in the fortunes of the drug sector. A
January reform to the the system under which some drugs were paid for by the
state has led to many widely-used products now sold at half or even full
price. The latest figures show that drugs sales are running at 8 per cent
below a year ago.
In Germany, drugs sales have recovered this year. August was a good month
for the industry, and sales for the year to August were up 6% on 1993, at
Dollars 8.7bn. This is compared with a 5% rise recorded year on year in
July.
France recorded a 2 per cent increase for the first eight months of 1994
over the same period of 1993.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Longuet case to be investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French justice ministry has given the go-ahead to two formal
investigations in a corruption case which forced the resignation of Mr
Gerard Longuet, then industry minister, earlier this month, writes John
Ridding in Paris.
The investigations, which are expected to be launched today, will focus on
allegations of illicit financing relating to the construction of Mr
Longuet's holiday villa in St Tropez and on the management of companies
linked to the former industry minister which are suspected of concealing
payments from business groups.
Mr Longuet has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement released on Saturday,
following the decision by the justice ministry to authorise the new probes,
he described the allegations against him as 'baseless.' He said the new
investigations would allow him to prove his innocence.
The judicial authorities are investigating whether Mr Longuet received
payments and preferential financial terms on his villa in return for
granting public contracts. The new probes will examine Investel, a holding
company created by Mr Longuet in 1989 and Avenir 55, a consultancy firm for
which Mr Longuet worked.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Resentment surfaces in Russia's Arctic sea of oil sludge:
John Thornhill finds people are beginning to raise their voices in a region
used to suffering pollution in silence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The remote Russian Arctic town of Usinsk is blinking in bewilderment in the
glare of international publicity. US claims that a recent oil spill nearby
was several times larger than the world's previous worst disaster in Alaska
in 1989 have provoked outrage from the local authorities, hostility from the
local oil company, and a mood of bemusement among the local population.
Some residents just do not understand the fuss, given that similar spills
have happened before without stirring much controversy.
Mr Philip Gursky, a ruddy-faced pensioner, who lives in a rough-hewn wooden
cottage by the Kolva river, says he has seen many oil leaks, blow-outs and
burning slicks in the 40 years he has lived in the region. He shrugs his
shoulders at the latest incident after which scores of workers removed oil
from the river outside his front door. 'I am used to it,' he says.
Sadly, Russia is accustomed to such accidents, although it remains
unaccustomed to the controversy they now arouse.
A local environmental group claims that internal documents obtained from
Komineft, the oil company responsible for the faulty pipeline, reveal there
were more than 1,900 leaks between 1986 and 1991, with an alarming
acceleration towards the end of that period.
Environmentalists estimate Russia may lose 1-3 per cent of its oil output
each year through leaks in its 45,000 miles of pipelines. In an industrial
culture that stresses production over the environment, managers prefer to
pump oil rather than repair damaged infrastructure and shut and re-start
wells.
Mr Vyacheslav Bibikov, vice-president of Komi Republic - reputedly one of
Russia's more reactionary regions, gives the official response. 'The
situation is localised and controlled and we consider that excessive
attention has been given to this accident. Nothing terrible has happened
here,' he says.
Mr Nikolai Ponomaryev, deputy general director of Komineft, reacted even
more fiercely when questioned by western journalists and environmental
campaigners. In a flash-back to Soviet-style attitudes, the glowering Mr
Ponomaryev refused to discuss the company's pipeline capacity on the grounds
of 'commercial secrecy' and suggested foreigners who had failed to win
business in the area were exaggerating the affair.
Perhaps no-one will ever know how much oil has been spilled near Usinsk.
Local government officials and Komineft directors ridicule US Energy
Department claims that 270,000 tonnes of oil has leaked. But even accepting
the minimum official figure of 14,000 tonnes - which western oilmen in the
region find hard to believe - the spillage still represents an appalling
environmental blight.
Mr Anatoly Nyukin, head of Komi Republic's civil defence, says he has not
seen one dead bird or fish as a result of the accident. But local residents
point out that pollution killed much of the local wildlife long ago.
Mrs Chesleva Popova, mayor of the 170-year old Kolva village, says: 'There
was a very big resource of fish here 10 years ago. But now there are
practically no fish left.' She says those fish they do catch are used to
make a traditional local dish. 'But often the fish smell strongly of oil and
it is not pleasant to eat,' she says.
More than 200 people have been working intensively to clear up the damage.
Using vacuum pumps and bulldozers, they have cleaned up most of the black
sludge that oozed into the Kolva and Usa rivers, where 7km-9km of river bank
were heavily polluted.
But removing the estimated 11,000 tonnes of oil which remain in the flooded
marshlands will be slow and laborious. So far the clean-up has been eased by
the relatively mild weather. But temperatures can drop to minus 50 degrees
in winter and the oil must be removed before the spring thaws threaten to
spread a fresh ecological disaster.
The 60,000 who live in and around Usinsk are hardly strangers to such
hardships. The grim and grimy town, which clings to the edge of the Arctic
circle, was built in a region infamous as one of the most terrible islands
in Stalin's Gulag archipelago. Many 'criminals' from the nearby Vorkuta camp
settled in the area after their release. There is an acceptance of hardship
and a reluctance to moan found rarely in Russia's bigger cities.
Usinsk itself was built 20 years ago by Komineft to support oil exploration.
Like most Soviet industrial enterprises, the company created its own
mini-welfare state, building eight schools, a kindergarten and a hospital.
Some residents fear Komineft will run these down now it is a privatised
company with profits in mind. Unemployment is already rising alarmingly as
the company sheds workers.
The arrival of western companies is beginning to change the town. Conoco,
the US oil group, has set up the Polar Lights joint venture with
Archangelskgeologia, a Russian exploration company, bringing much-needed
jobs to the region. Komi Arctic Oil, a joint venture between Komineft, Gulf
Canada, and British Gas has also developed a field north of Usinsk and set
up smart offices in town.
That seepage of capitalism is already visibly transforming Usinsk. Snickers
chocolate bars are on sale in street kiosks; posters of scantily clad women
straddling motor-bikes are displayed in the small shopping centre; BMW cars
cruise the streets disgorging the local hard men clad in leather jackets,
gold chains and shell suits.
The after-effects of the spillage may speed further social change.
Komineft's managers, alarmed at the publicity and fast-falling share price,
must appreciate they are now accountable to a far broader constituency than
party bosses or central planners. Local government officials know they now
live in a transparent world and have responsibilities for a precious
environment which Green groups claim is of international significance.
And the townspeople of Usinsk are slowly understanding that as shareholders
in the privatised Komineft they are also part-owners who can influence the
company's and region's development.
There are tentative signs that after years of silence local people are
beginning to raise their voice. 'I do not want to say that people were
afraid by what has happened but they think about the future and want to make
sure this is not repeated,' says Mrs Popova. One shop assistant raises a
common plea: 'Usinsk is my town. It is my home. I do not want anyone to
spoil it any more.'

FT  31 OCT 94 / International Press Review: Moscow tries to see the news in
the oil leak - Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the daily Rabochaya Tribuna of last Wednesday, an item appeared in the
front page brief news section, 'In one paragraph'. The headline read:
'Ecological catastrophe in northern Russia - and it seems it worries the
Americans more than us'.
The story, citing the Voice of America radio station, said: 'American
officials say that, in a region of the Arctic round the town of Usinsk, a
pipeline has ruptured, causing the largest oil spill in history. American
representatives in Washington, quoting information coming from Russia, say
that 2m barrels of oil has been spilled. The US deputy energy secretary says
that the spill is an ecological catastrophe.'
This says a great deal about coverage of the Usinsk oil spill, about the
attitude of the press - and of official and civil society - to the incident,
and about the state of ecological awareness in Russia.
It also says much about the majority Russian view of the world as one
eco-system. For, with few exceptions, the Russian press covered the incident
if at all through the industry and government sources cited in last
Tuesday's New York Times, which broke the story.
Only two leading newspapers, Izvestiya and Sevodnya, gave it wide coverage -
though limited largely to news written in Moscow, not on-the-spot reports or
analysis. By the end of the week, a Russian wire service was quoting the
head of the company responsible for the spill as blaming western interests
for blowing up the story for commercial gain.
Yet the facts - the spill, the declaration of an emergency situation in the
region and vast natural damage - were known to and published in newspapers
in the Komi republic weeks before the Times story.
The region's Krasnoe Znamya (Red Banner) of September 15 ran a splash
headline: 'Pipeline of Trouble - Usinsk region has become an area of
ecological disaster'. The story gave details of streams running with oil and
roads covered with lakes of oil. It ended with the observation: 'We don't
just have a state of emergency here: we have an ecological catastrophe.'
The story - which the paper followed up throughout October - did not appear
in the central press, nor on all-Russia TV. Not because of censorship - but
because it was not seen to have more than local importance.
Western journalists who travelled to the inaccessible region to cover the
story last week were met with hostility mixed with genuine bewilderment: Why
come all this way to cover as common a thing as an oil leak, and what has it
to do with you?
Izvestiya, the best of the central dailies, did best by the story. It ran a
splash headline last Wednesday: 'Why should Americans be more concerned
about an oil spill in the tundra than Russia?' It slammed the Komi oil
company for attempting to conceal the whole affair, saying it was a
'saddening circumstance' that the alarm was raised by the Americans and that
a government commission was formed only after US Vice President Al Gore
offered assistance.
The daily Sevodnya made the story its second front page lead - noting in an
editorial comment with the story: 'It's understandable and, alas, all too
common that information on our ecological disaster should again come from
the west.'
But by the end of last week an explanation emerged for the western concern:
it was driven by the profit motive. Interfax news agency, quoting 'experts
of Moscow's leading broker and investment companies', said the news had
clipped between Dollars 1 and Dollars 2 off the shares of the Komi Oil
company. 'Komi Oil director General Valentin Leonidov told a shareholders'
meeting on Friday that the campaign on the pipeline accident was carried out
in the interests of those who want to buy Komi Oil for a song,' it said.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Bosnian Serbs bent on revenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic declared a full-scale state of war at
the weekend in the wake of the biggest setback suffered by Serb forces since
fighting began in Bosnia.
Serb troops in Croatia also went on a state of alert along the border with
Bosnia yesterday, but UN peacekeepers said there was no evidence they had
crossed over to assist the Bosnian Serb army.
These moves came as Bosnian government forces continued their offensive in
the north-west, raising fears of a Bosnian Serb counter-attack against
Bihac, the Moslem enclave which is one of six UN safe areas in Bosnia. 'If
the pocket is attacked, the UN will have no choice but to request Nato air
support,' said Mr Colin Murphy, UN spokesman in Sarajevo.
In a sign of possible plans for a counter-attack, Mr Karadzic ordered a
general mobilisation in his self-styled Serb state. Over the past week,
Bosnian Serb forces have lost some 200 sq km in the north-west.
The Bosnian Serbs are isolated after being cut off three months ago by their
patron, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. There is even speculation Mr
Karadzic has engineered the stunning losses in a bid to force Mr Milosevic
to abandon his blockade against the Bosnian Serbs.
But Belgrade's state media has imposed a total news black-out on the losses.
Renewed fighting erupted yesterday after the mostly Moslem government forces
encircled Bosanska Krupa, a Serb-held town on the River Una in the
north-west. In an unconfirmed report, Sarajevo radio said government forces
had entered the town.
Serb forces from Bosnia and Croatia have surrounded the dense Moslem pocket
in the north-west for most of the 31-month war. But last week the Bosnian
Fifth Corps drove Serb forces from the Grabez plateau, strategic high ground
above Bihac town. Up to 10,000 civilians have fled the area and Serb
soldiers have abandoned tanks and other hardware to their foes.
In Sarajevo, Mr Murphy said the UN was considering using air power against
government forces in the nearby demilitarised zone who have been launching
attacks on Serb-held territory. General Rose, British leader of UN forces in
Bosnia, issued a similar threat earlier this month, but it is likely the US
would be opposed.
The Bosnian Serbs meanwhile released four British UN soldiers detained in
the Kupres region of central Bosnia last week on suspicion of spying.
Russia would withdraw its peacekeeping troops from former Yugoslavia if Nato
gained ultimate control over whether to use force, Mr Andrei Kozyrev,
foreign minister, said yesterday. On Friday Nato approved a deal with the UN
on plans for joint bombing operations in Bosnia. Though Nato officials
stressed there would be no change in the basic 'dual key' command structure
under which Nato supports UN decisions, Mr Kozyrev warned against its
abolition.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Pope widens electoral base for choice of his successor
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Pope John Paul II yesterday nominated 30 new cardinals, further broadening
the international base from which a future pontiff will be chosen.
The most politically innovative of the choices are the appointments of
cardinals serving in Albania, the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, Cuba, and
Belarus, as well as the Lebanese patriarch, Nasrallah Pierre Sfeir.
The move to increase the number of cardinals - the highest ranking members
of the Catholic hierarchy with the sole right to elect a new pope - had been
foreshadowed. However, the decision was made earlier than expected and comes
against a background of the 74-year-old pontiff's declining health.
Vatican watchers said the Pope had tended to choose persons generally
sympathetic to his conservative ethical views. Within this, he had
considerably broadened the geographical spread, especially to former
communist eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa. Nevertheless, four
new appointees are Italian and the Europeans still dominate the cardinals'
conclave. Britain gained a cardinal with the nomination of Mons Thomas
Winning, Archbishop of Glasgow.
The cardinals will be formally proclaimed at a special consistory in Rome on
November 26. The precise number of new cardinals shows that Pope John Paul
II is anxious to respect the informal limit of 120 electors under the age of
80 set by his predecessors.
At the time of the consistory 96 cardinals will be below the age of 80,
while six of the new cardinals will be over that.
In the event of a new conclave 100 of the 120 cardinals would have been
chosen by Pope John Paul II. Of the total, 55 would be from east and west
Europe (20 of whom are Italian), 33 from the Americas, 15 from Africa, 14
from Asia and three from Oceania.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Efforts to curb sleaze have a hollow ring: Corruption
measures still leave loopholes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the British House of Commons facing almost daily allegations of
parliamentary dishonesty, and corruption stories emerging steadily from
France and Italy, Europe's commission and parliament are addressing how best
to avoid such accusations themselves.
The parliament is not in a promising position. Recent reports have tainted
it with an image of generous and inefficiently administered expenses,
corporate goodies dished out by zealous lobbyists and thinly justified
overseas trips at the taxpayers' expense.
Mr Klaus Hansch, the parliament's president, says it needs to put itself in
an 'irreproachable' position, and this week announced measures to slash
expenses.
'The situation has become untenable for cost reasons and for the image of
the parliament abroad,' he said, outlining proposals to cut the number of
meetings parliamentary committees can hold outside either Strasbourg or
Brussels to one every four years from one every year.
He has also proposed that the size of delegations visiting non-EU countries
be halved. The two measures, he says, will save Ecu5.5m (Pounds 4.32m).
But even if the parliament smartens up its image on expenses, socialist MEPs
are arguing that arrangements for declaring interests are not sufficiently
stringent.
There is a mandatory register of financial interests, but it is not
published as a parliamentary document and is therefore not widely
circulated. Any European who wants to check his or her MP's interests has to
travel to Strasbourg or to Brussels to transcribe information by hand.
Photocopies are not permitted.
Secondly, the Socialist group argues that not enough detail is entered in
the register. An MEP has to declare for whom he or she is working, but not
what the work is.
Further, according to Mr Glyn Ford, Socialist spokesman on parliament rules,
only direct financial interest has to be declared. Friendly associations
with foreign countries, which result in all-expenses paid holidays, for
example, are not recorded.
'I would like to know these things when evaluating members' speeches,' says
Mr Ford. 'If someone is giving his opinion on what is going on in East
Timor, then an all expenses paid trip to Indonesia is relevant.'
Meanwhile, the parliament is discussing how best to ensure that Europe's 21
new commissioners, due to take office early next year, do not harbour
political or financial conflicts of interest.
Commissioners have always had to take oaths ahead of their period in office,
declaring their full independence and promising not to seek earnings from
any other source. This led to certain commissioners relinquishing obvious
interests. For example, Mr Abel Matutes, the former Spanish commissioner,
handed over control of his hotel group to his brother before going to
Brussels.
This time, the parliament is determined to use the extra powers granted to
it under the Maastricht treaty, to vet thoroughly the incoming
commissioners. As a result, the appointees will be asked to answer questions
in public and on the record for the first time.
Parliament points out in a set of recommendations adopted by its committee
on institutional affairs that this process will be the 'only democratic
element' in choosing the new commissioners, who are appointed by the
governments of the member states.
The vetting is likely to involve a severe grilling by the appropriate
parliamentary committees. 'It will not mean US-style teams of private
investigators,' says Mr Julian Priestly, secretary general of the Socialist
group. But fairly elaborate and even aggressive tactics are envisaged.
The committee on institutional affairs' recommendations says that particular
importance will be attached to 'guarantees of independence', including the
need to ensure that the prospective commissioners are 'genuinely independent
from the national governments that nominated them and also, that there are
no potential financial conflicts of interest'.
One recommendation states: 'It is highly desirable that a few key political
questions - ie on two speed Europe, opt-outs, enlargement to eastern Europe
etc - be posed to all the candidates in order to assess their views on the
European integration process.'
As far as financial interests are concerned, the committee recommends that
the parliament should draw up a short and unbureaucratic list of questions
to be submitted to all the candidates.
As an illustration, it highlights the type of questions raised in the US for
completion by presidential nominees. These include such detailed points as
financial transactions, investments, obligations liabilities, and any
business or other relationships.
In spite of the rigorous approach the parliament intends to adopt, the
process rings slightly hollow. Its extra powers do not extend to the right
to veto individual commissioners. All the parliament can do is mention its
misgivings to Mr Santer. Otherwise, it can veto the entire commission, but
this would be an unlikely step.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Sir Leon - too powerful, too clever - cut down to size: FT
writers examine the line-up at the European Commission after the struggle to
divide up portfolios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shortly after Mr Jacques Santer was appointed president of the European
Commission, a senior Brussels diplomat delivered a friendly warning to Sir
Leon Brittan. 'Of all the Commissioners, you have the most to lose under Mr
Santer.'
Sir Leon was taken aback. One of the stars of the outgoing Delors
Commission, he found it hard to believe that Mr Santer would not wish to
make the most of his talents.
The diplomat agreed, but pointed out that Sir Leon risked being seen as too
clever - and too powerful - for his own good in the incoming Santer
Commission.
On Saturday afternoon, the warning came true. Sir Leon, chief EU trade
negotiator, found himself stripped of the plum portfolio of central and
eastern Europe, and pondering resignation. It is a stunning turnaround for a
politician who was acclaimed a year ago as one of the architects of the Gatt
Uruguay Round agreement and who had contemplated a bid to become Commission
president.
Sir Leon's fall from grace may be viewed as an inevitable come-uppance for
someone who has never been a team player in Brussels. His caustic comments,
razor-sharp intellect, and appetite for work have prompted jealousy as much
as admiration among colleagues (with the exception of Mr Jacques Delors with
whom he has much in common).
Sir Leon also misplayed his cards during negotiations over his new portfolio
with Mr Santer. Colleagues such as Mr Manuel Marin, the senior Spanish
commissioner, and Mr Padraig Flynn, Irish Commissioner, curried favour by
offering to surrender portions of their fiefdoms; but Sir Leon offered too
little, too late. He also underestimated the Santer team's determination to
end the division between economic and political affairs in the new
Commission.
Thus, Sir Leon's opening offer was to give up the Northern Mediterranean,
Turkey, Cyprus, Malta, and economic relations with former Yugoslavia; then
he upped it to all of Asia, excluding Japan. On Saturday afternoon, he
proposed giving up everything, including the powerful trade instruments, if
he could keep relations with central Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Colleagues concede the gesture made little sense because it undermined Sir
Leon's chief argument: that the eastern European dossier largely turned on
economics and trade rather than politics and security, the speciality of Mr
Hans Van den Broek, the Dutch commissioner who eventually won the day.
Yet Sir Leon was also the victim of events beyond his control. The decision
to reward Mr Van den Broek was driven by the need to compensate the
Netherlands after France and Germany snubbed Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing
Dutch prime minister, in his bid to succeed Mr Delors as Commission
president.
Neither German commissioner supported Sir Leon on Saturday afternoon - a
surprise since the Bonn government continues to admire his contribution to
integrating central and eastern Europe into the EU. Was it just an accident
that Mr Wim Kok, Dutch prime minister, had paid a visit to Chancellor Helmut
Kohl just days before the Luxembourg meeting?
Sir Leon also appears to have suffered from lingering resentment over the
British veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister who was the
Franco-German candidate to succeed Mr Delors, at last June's European summit
in Corfu.
The veto won Mr John Major, British prime minister, a reprieve within his
ruling Conservative party. It also propelled a reluctant Mr Santer into the
top Commission post.
However, it left Mr Major little leverage when it came to pleading Sir
Leon's case with European allies - and Mr Santer. 'Corfu was not without
cost,' said a colleague of Sir Leon.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Santer's choice packs a political punch: Future president's
priority was a Commission that worked as a team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nobody said it was going to be easy. But after a day of tough talking inside
Senningen Castle in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Mr Jacques Santer emerged
with a deal on the division of portfolios in the new expanded Commission.
The agreement boosted the authority of Mr Santer, a last-minute compromise
candidate earlier this year to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the
Commission; but the cost could prove high if a disgruntled Sir Leon Brittan
carries out his threat to resign after being stripped of his most prized
portfolio, eastern Europe.
The question is whether Mr Santer - known as the man who never says No in
his native Luxembourg - pursued an early deal at the expense of downgrading
one of the few effective performers in the outgoing Delors Commission.
Supporters of Sir Leon leave no doubt that their commissioner was treated
poorly, with little regard to his track record in championing closer
relations with central and eastern Europe, perhaps the most important task
for the EU over the next five years.
'On a conservative estimate, Sir Leon's workload drops 30 per cent,' says
one supporter. 'It could be as high as 60 per cent.'
Those more sympathetic to Mr Santer argue that the president-designate tried
everything to broker a deal between Sir Leon and Mr Hans van den Broek, the
Dutch commissioner who is the big winner in Saturday's share-out of
responsibilities in external relations.
'We went through all sorts of different options,' said a senior Santer aide,
'but the eastern European dossier turned into a beauty contest.'
Under the deal, Mr Van den Broek gains control of economic and political
relations with central and eastern Europe, as well as retaining
responsibility for the common foreign and security policy, subject to the
authority of President Santer.
Sir Leon retains control of his multilateral trade dossier, which includes
the setting-up of the new World Trade Organisation, as well as relations
with North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China, South Korea, Macao
and Taiwan.
Mr Santer made clear on Saturday evening that his overriding concern was to
ensure that the new Commission works as a team when it moves into office
next January, pending a vote of approval from the European parliament.
He also sought to assert his authority by selecting three areas in which he
intends to be primus inter pares: common security and foreign policy;
preparations for monetary union; and institutional issues ahead of the 1996
inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Santer said the need to end personal fiefdoms was even more urgent now
that the Commission was expanded from the present 17 commissioners to 21,
assuming that Sweden and Norway join Austria and Finland in approving EU
membership in next month's referendums.
Most Brussels insiders agree that Mr Santer - egged on by his influential
chief of staff Mr Jim Cloos - was right to end the artificial division
between political and economic affairs inside the Commission's external
relations apparatus, and to adopt a division on geographical lines.
The divisions led to constant sniping between supporters of Mr Van den Broek
and Sir Leon in Brussels. Abroad, it led to two commissioners landing in
successive weeks in eastern European capitals to talk policy.
Yet the row over Sir Leon's treatment risks obscuring a broader judgment
about the new Commission, its organisation and its likely future direction.
As Mr Santer noted on Saturday, even the harshest Euro-sceptics cannot
accuse the new Commission of being packed with bureaucrats. It is highly
political: a former prime minister (Mrs Edith Cresson of France) sits
alongside a man who almost became prime minister (Mr Neil Kinnock, the
former UK Labour party leader). There are also five women, up from one in
the outgoing Delors Commission.
None of the women is a shrinking violet. Ms Ritt Bjerregaard, who wins
environment and nuclear safety in eastern Europe, enjoys a formidable
reputation in her native Denmark; so too, Ms Anti Gradin, the Swedish
diplomat, and Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, the German trade union leader. Watch
out for Ms Emma Bonino, the Italian abortion rights activist who will handle
the hitherto neglected consumer affairs dossier.
A second leitmotif is Mr Santer's calculated effort to win Yes votes in the
referendums in Scandinavia. Norway is rewarded with the fisheries portfolio,
a vital national interest. Sweden wins the increasingly important judicial
and immigration portfolio.
Mr Santer has also shown sensitivity to France which was worried about
losing influence with the departure of Mr Delors. Mr Yves-Thibault de
Silguy, a technocrat, takes over the plum job of economic and monetary
affairs, putting him at the centre of the plan to create a single currency
by the end of the century.
Mr Mario Monti, the distinguished Italian economist, will take charge of the
single market, including fiscal policy and capital movements; while Mr
Kinnock, who has never held a ministerial post, is delighted with the
transport portfolio which includes the planned multi-billion Ecu rail and
road trans-European networks.
At first sight, the choice of Mr Franz Fischler of Austria to take over the
agriculture dossier is surprising. Few could have expected a new member
state to take charge of agriculture which accounts for more than half of the
Ecu70bn (Pounds 55bn) budget.
But no-one showed much interest in taking on a job which is bound to involve
further unpopular reforms in the next five years, partly to prepare for the
entry of the central European countries at the turn of the century. So Mr
Santer handed the job to Mr Fischler, an old political ally.
Despite the call for collegiality, it is possible to predict friction in
some areas. Mr Padraig Flynn, the wily Irishman who runs social policy, is
uneasy about Mrs Cresson running training and education.
Nor were some commissioners delighted that the 10 socialist and social
democrat commissioners met ahead of the Saturday session in Luxembourg.
Yet the real test will be how Sir Leon intends to work with Mr Van den
Broek, should he decide to stay on. Those who know him predict that Sir Leon
would find it impossible to resist carving out a role in central and eastern
Europe, using his commercial trade instruments.
In that case, Mr Santer, who left most of the dirty work to Mr Cloos during
the portfolio negotiations, would have his authority tested to the full.

FT  31 OCT 94 / PM urges Brittan to stay in EU job: Commissioner considers
resignation after losing battle for eastern Europe portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and PHILIP STEPHENS

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the prime minister, made a direct appeal at the weekend to
Sir Leon Brittan to stay on as the senior UK commissioner in Brussels after
Sir Leon narrowly lost a battle to retain responsibility for eastern Europe
in his portfolio.
Sir Leon will decide in the next few days whether to resign his post, close
associates said yesterday. He is said to be crestfallen, and is considering
all options, including a return to British politics. His aim would be to
press the case for a more pro-European policy in Britain, associates said.
But pressure is mounting on Sir Leon to stay in his job, which still
includes responsibility for multilateral trade negotiations and relations
with the leading Asian economies and the world's industrialised nations.
Amid irritation at 10 Downing Street and private acknowledgement that the
British government's influence in Brussels had been diminished, Mr Major
told Sir Leon he was 'disappointed' by how the portfolios had been shared
out by Mr Jacques Santer, incoming Commission president.
Mr Major added in a telephone conversation with Sir Leon that his
responsibility for trade relations with the developed world was 'crucially
important'.
The conversation came as British ministers echoed the implicit annoyance at
Mr Santer's decision. The early admission of former communist countries to
the Union is a central plank of Mr Major's overall strategy towards the
development of the EU.
Tory Euro-sceptics warned that the choice of Mr Hans Van den Broek of the
Netherlands to oversee enlargement to the east heightened the risk of a
confrontation between London and Brussels at the 1996 intergovernmental
conference.
There was also a suspicion among Tory MPs that Mr Santer, whose candidacy
for the presidency was supported by Britain after Mr Major had vetoed the
choice of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, had been under
pressure to prove his 'independence' from London.
But Mrs Pauline Green, leader of the Socialist group in the European
Parliament, accused Sir Leon of 'behaving like a spoilt child' after he
hinted he might resign. 'Sir Leon Brittan is clearly motivated by personal
greed and ambition,' she said.
There was speculation last night that Mr Santer might try to mollify Sir
Leon by naming him as one of the Commission's two vice-presidents.
Arguments over the division of responsibilities in the new European
Commission, the Brussels executive body, dominated Saturday's talks in
Luxembourg chaired by Mr Santer. Commission members were evenly split over
whether Sir Leon or Mr van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister,
should have responsibility for central and eastern Europe.
Sir Leon won support from Mr Neil Kinnock, former Labour party leader who is
a newly-appointed commissioner, and Scandinavian commissioners who argued
that Sir Leon was best qualified to prepare the next round of EU
enlargement.
But neither of the two German commissioners supported Sir Leon, apparently
because of the Bonn government's desire to improve relations with the
Netherlands after Chancellor Helmut Kohl blocked Mr Ruud Lubbers, the
outgoing Dutch prime minister, in his bid for Commission president earlier
this year.
Too powerful and clever Sir Leon cut down to size, Page 2

FT  31 OCT 94 / 'Foul' cried over football tournament ticket system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACQUELINE SHOREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Football Association was accused yesterday of encouraging a black market
in tickets for the 1996 European football championship, by unfairly
requiring fans to buy tickets they do not want. The tournament is to be
hosted by England.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow heritage secretary responsible for sport, said: 'The
aim of ensuring that the real fans get the best chance for tickets is a
sensible one, but the Football Association appears to have devised a system
which, perhaps inadvertently, will not end up with this aim fulfilled.
Furthermore, it will facilitate the starting up of an illegal black market.'
FA rules mean that a fan wanting one Pounds 60 ticket for the Wembley final
must spend at least Pounds 280 on a total of 11 tickets. For one final
ticket, fans must buy two for the semi-finals, two for the quarters, and two
for each of three group games - even if they want only one for each.
The tickets went on general sale last Thursday on a 'progressive loyalty'
basis:
To buy tickets for the final knock-out stages of the competition - the
quarter-, semi- and final matches - fans must buy tickets for at least three
matches from the earlier group stage.
To qualify to buy one ticket for the final, fans must buy two for the semis.
To qualify to buy semi-final tickets, supporters must buy two for the
quarter-finals. However, they cannot buy more tickets for the knock-out
matches than for the group games, so they must buy two tickets for each of
the three group games - even if they want only one.
Supporters say the unwanted tickets will deprive other fans of the chance to
see games and encourage fans to become ticket touts. 'Without question, this
system will create a black market,' said Mr Steve Beauchampe, international
officer of the Football Supporters' Association.
Mr Mike Parry of the FA said he hoped that love of the game would compel
holders of spare tickets to pass them on to true fans.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Mark Thatcher deal supported by Tory backers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mark Thatcher, the son of former prime minister Baroness Thatcher,
secured backing for one of his biggest US investment deals from some of his
mother's closest business supporters.
Hanson, the UK-quoted conglomerate, and Mr Li Ka-Shing, the Hong Kong
billionaire - both of whom have been substantial donors to the Conservative
party - invested in a US business consortium put together by Mr Thatcher and
his then partner, Mr Bruce Leadbetter.
Hanson said it has lost Dollars 130,000 (Pounds 79,750) on its investment of
Dollars 400,000 made in the late 1980s. Mr Martin Taylor, a vice-chairman of
Hanson, said last week: 'We knew that Mark Thatcher was involved when we
agreed to make the investment. It was the only time we invested with him.'
Mr Thatcher denied that he had exploited his mother's connections. He said:
'If the whole thing was funded by the Who's Who contributors to the party,
then that would have been a different game. But for them to subscribe to
two-fifteenths of the investment, I do not regard that as significant.'
Other investors in Emergency Networks, a Dallas-based home security company
in which Mr Thatcher and his partners invested, included Mr Bruce Babbit,
currently US interior secretary, and Mr Jay Pritzker, one of the owners of
the Hyatt Hotel chain.
Meanwhile, in the first detailed interview on his affairs for several years,
Mr Thatcher poured cold water on widespread reports that he is worth tens of
millions of pounds.
'It would be significantly wrong to conclude that I am worth more than
Pounds 5m,' he said. 'There is just nothing to support it apart from
innuendo. This whole idea that I have had tremendous success is just a
myth.'
Conservative party officials have pointed to his US interests as the main
source of Mr Thatcher's wealth. They were rebutting allegations that he
exploited his position as the only son of the then British prime minister to
earn commissions from defence sales.
A Financial Times analysis of his US business interests, based on company
filings and court documents, has found little evidence of significant
earnings from his US activities. On the other hand, these activities have
been coloured by two corporate collapses, litigation and boardroom rows.
In the interview, Mr Thatcher reiterated his denial that he received a
commission from the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah defence contract signed in 1985
between the UK and Saudi Arabian governments.
He confirmed that he is a friend of Mr Wafic Said, the millionaire
businessman who acted as a go-between on the UK side of the Al Yamamah talks
in the mid-1980s.
However, Mr Thatcher said: 'Merely because I know this man does not mean to
say that he is going to pay me Pounds 12m because I am a nice guy.'
Mr Thatcher said that if he had had 'tremendous' success, 'I would be
sitting on my own private island in the South Pacific, but I am not'.

FT  31 OCT 94 / Volvo to expand truckmaking in Europe and Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is embarking on a
far-reaching expansion of its truck operations in Europe and Asia.
The ambitious moves, which include the development of a range of trucks to
allow it to enter the European light truck market for the first time, result
from the group's fundamental review of global strategy made after the
collapse of its planned merger with Renault nearly a year ago.
Volvo, the world's second-largest heavy truckmaker (above 15 tonnes gross
vehicle weight), behind Mercedes-Benz of Germany, is focusing corporate
development on its automotive operations with the divestment of most other
activities.
As a key part of this strategy, it plans to:
Expand the capacity of its heavy truck operations in Europe by up to 20 per
cent by mid-1996, with the investment of more than SKr1bn (Pounds 86m).
Develop a range of light trucks (7.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) to allow
it to challenge established rivals such as Mercedes-Benz, Iveco, MAN,
Renault and Daf in this segment of the European market.
Establish a joint venture in China with the aim of adding a production
centre in Asia to its three existing regional truck manufacturing operations
in Europe and North and South America. It has also launched a feasibility
study into establishing production in India.
Volvo is leading the European truck industry's emergence from recession, and
its share of the west European heavy truck market has jumped to 15.5 per
cent in the first eight months of 1994 from 12.1 per cent in the whole of
1993.
Mr Karl-Erling Trogen, chief executive of Volvo Truck, said the business was
operating at the limit of its capacity in Europe.
Production of Volvo-brand trucks, mainly in Europe and in Brazil - Volvo
sells under the WhiteGMC brand in North America - was running at an
annualised rate of 45,000 a year, a rise of more than 60 per cent from under
28,000 a year in the depth of the recession in mid-1993.
The group is already investing SKr390m in order to raise capacity to 50,000
by July next year, but in early December the Volvo board is expected to
approve the investment of more than SKr1bn to raise capacity further to
between 55,000 and 60,000 trucks a year (excluding North America) by
mid-1996.
Mr Trogen said that Asia was Volvo's 'number one priority' for geographic
expansion. It had launched a feasibility study with China National Heavy
Truck and Shandong Automotive for the establishment of joint ventures for
the production of both trucks and components in Shandong province,
south-east of Beijing.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Cost-cutting lifts BP - The week
ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TUESDAY: British Petroleum is expected to announce net profits of about
Pounds 360m when it publishes third-quarter results. Cost-cutting in recent
years is likely to leave it with a stronger improvement than has been
achieved by its peers. The chemicals division could bring pleasant
surprises, with a solid performance in the US. TUESDAY: Interim results from
Thames Water open the water companies' reporting season. The interims are
expected to show an 8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, before exceptionals,
to Pounds 148m.
Investors will be watching two issues very closely in the first results
after the summer's price review: first, the dividend, forecast to show an 8
per cent increase to 8p; and, second, the performance of the non-core
businesses. A dose of further bad news on the non-core operation would not
be welcomed.
TUESDAY: Powerscreen International, the Northern Ireland-based manufacturer
of screening and stone-crushing equipment, is expected to report interim
pre-tax profits of Pounds 13m-Pounds 14m, against Pounds 12.6m last year.
Analysts will be examining the performance of Simplicity Engineering and
Ludlow-Saylor, two US businesses acquired in February.
WEDNESDAY: BET, the business services group, is expected to report pre-tax
profits of about Pounds 54m for the six months to September, compared with
Pounds 47m, but the picture is clouded by uncertainty over the scale of
further rationalisation costs. The group, which over-expanded through
acquisition in the 1980s, has recently seen a couple of high-level
departures and analysts will want reassurance that its recent recovery
remains on course.
Specifically, there has been little sign so far of the 'bolt-on'
acquisitions which John Clark, the chief executive, mooted in May.
WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY: Interims from J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest food
retailer (Wednesday) and final results from Kwik Save, the biggest discount
chain (Thursday), should provide an insight into the state of the grocery
market.
Pre-tax profit forecasts for Sainsbury range from Pounds 430m to about
Pounds 460m, with the consensus at around Pounds 445m - a 7 per cent
increase from a re-stated Pounds 417m last year. Sales in the supermarket
chain are expected to be up by about 7.5 per cent, with little price
inflation.
Forecasts for Kwik Save are concentrated around Pounds 130m, an increase of
only 3 per cent from last year's Pounds 126.1m. The group has been affected
by the increased competition in the market, which is eroding its price
advantage over the superstores. Analysts are looking for an increased
interim dividend of about 5.5p, against 4.9p last time.
WEDNESDAY: BAT Industries is expected to report an increase of about 10 per
cent in third-quarter pre-tax profits from last year's Pounds 455m. The main
growth will come from US tobacco where BAT, along with other producers, has
enjoyed a recovery from last year's pricing traumas brought on by 'Marlboro
Friday'.
THURSDAY: Speculation over the future of Boots' pharmaceuticals division is
expected to overshadow sharply improved interim figures from the retailing
and drugs group.
Although it is expected to highlight an increase of about 33 per cent in
first-half profits, analysts are likely to focus on the outcome of the
company's year-long review of the drugs business.
This was prompted by last year's withdrawal of the heart drug Manoplax,
which left a gap in products under development.
Boots' officials insist they are under no pressure to sell the business,
which remains both profitable and cash-generative. But rumours that disposal
was the favoured choice were heightened earlier this year when the company
issued a confidential sales memorandum for potential bidders.
While confirming that it is in discussions with a number of companies, the
group remains coy about its intentions - partly to avoid rousing fears of a
possible withdrawal from Nottingham, where the pharmaceuticals division is
based.
Meanwhile, interim pre-tax profits are forecast to have risen from Pounds
174.6m to about Pounds 233m, although last year's figures were depressed by
Pounds 35m of charges. The chemists' chain, however, is expected to remain
the most profitable division.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Action by Names' opponents adds twist to saga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-running High Court battle by hard-hit Lloyd's Names to win
compensation for losses took a further twist yesterday when their opponents'
lawyers said they would launch their own legal proceedings.
The action is being taken by lawyers representing 'errors and omissions'
insurers who provided negligence cover for the professional Lloyd's agencies
being sued by Names' action groups.
Earlier this month Gooda Walker Names won substantial damages for losses
incurred between 1988 and 1990. E&amp;O insurers now want the High Court to
clarify whether those Names, the individuals whose assets have historically
supported the insurance market, should be allowed to take a large share of
the funds available for paying damages - or whether some should be held back
to pay awards won by other Names' action groups.
They also want the court to rule whether compensation should include
interest and whether E&amp;O insurers should help fund an interim payment.
The latest move, which could involve more than 30 Names' action groups,
means Gooda Walker Names are unlikely to receive even an interim payment
until December or next year. However, their lawyers said resolving such
issues could avoid problems later.
Mr Philip Rocher of solicitors Wilde Sapte said: 'Our aim in this exercise
is to prevent E&amp;O underwriters from raising myriad arguments as to why they
should delay payment.'
The level of compensation for Gooda Walker Names has yet to be agreed. The
Names' estimate of Pounds 504m (which includes Pounds 71m in interest
payments) is strongly disputed by the E&amp;O insurers.
Lawyers representing the E&amp;O underwriters are expected to begin their
proceedings formally next week. The case is likely to be heard in December.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Business boosted by EU developments
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Business leaders believe developments in the European Union during the past
five years have helped to increase trade for their companies, says a survey
released yesterday.
The poll by MORI for American Express, conducted among 101 board directors
of Britain's largest 500 companies, revealed that 39 per cent of those
polled believed their companies had increased trade with Europe since 1989,
in spite of the fact that 35 per cent said EU developments had led to
stiffer competition.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Eggar supports Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain outside the European Union would be 'just an irrelevance', Mr Tim
Eggar, energy minister, warned in the Commons yesterday in dismissing
suggestions that withdrawal was a viable option.
He did not dispute assertions by Labour MPs that his words were principally
aimed at Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who recently branded as
'simplistic' those who argue that such a course is unthinkable.
Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour industry spokesman, said that although Mr Lamont's
name had not been mentioned he was the 'ghost at the feast'.
Mr Eggar cited Britain's success in attracting inward investment - which
amounted to Pounds 200bn in 1991 and is excelled only by the US - as
evidence of the benefits stemming from being 'at the heart of Europe'.
He said the government's success in excluding Britain from the European
Union's social chapter meant there were no barriers to flexible working
hours.
Mr Eggar denied that the discretionary grants available to industry through
regional selective assistance were under threat because of criticism from Mr
Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, in his earlier role as chief
secretary to the Treasury.
Mr Bell claimed that Mr Eggar had underlined the extent of the Tory splits
over Europe: extending from Mr Lamont and other Euro-sceptics on the back
benches, to Mr Portillo in the cabinet.
Labour would 'sign-up' to the full social chapter, said Mr Bell, denying
that inward investment would then decline.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Balance in Bosnia shifts Moslems' way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bosnian Moslem forces were yesterday consolidating their grip on 80 square
miles of territory in the far north of the republic seized in a lightning
offensive over the past three days.
Their Bosnian Serb enemies - isolated from their protectors in Belgrade and
facing a growing shortage of fuel - were caught unawares by the onslaught
and abandoned armour and equipment as they fled, according to the UN.
In other potentially ominous developments for the Bosnian Serbs, government
forces mounted an assault near the stronghold of Kupres, west of Sarajevo,
and the UN and Nato agreed on new procedures for air strikes.
General Dragomir Milosevic, a Bosnian Serb commander, pledged to retaliate
by shelling 'selected targets' in Sarajevo. This amounted to a threat to
restart the brutal bombardment of the Bosnian capital which ended in
February.
In a clear reference to air strikes, the UN commander General Sir Michael
Rose responded by saying: 'If they shell Sarajevo,they know what they can
expect.'
The Moslem successes reflect a gradual shift in the balance of military
power inside Bosnia, thanks to clandestine supplies of light arms and the
'over-stretched' condition of the Bosnian-Serb army as it struggles to hold
on to 70 per cent of the republic's territory.
The flare-up in Bosnian fighting coincides with a breakthrough in
international efforts to achieve a broad reconciliation between Serbs and
Croats.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the mediators on former Yugoslavia,
announced that Zagreb and Belgrade would start regular consultations at
foreign minister level on normalising their relations.
Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic has been told by western countries and
Russia that he should recognize Croatia as a precondition for further easing
of UN sanctions against his country.
On the face of things, both the Bosnian fighting and the peace moves in
Croatia are part of a single process: the decision by Mr Milosevic to seek
international favour and sever or at least loosen ties with his former
proteges in both neighbouring republics.
Under one scenario, a Belgrade-Zagreb reconciliation would deepen the
Bosnian Serbs' isolation and make them more willing to sue for peace on
terms acceptable to the world.
A strategic deal between Mr Milosevic and the Croatian government could also
neutralize the influence of the stridently nationalist politicians who now
control the Serb-occupied areas of Croatia.
As things now stand, those politicians are good friends of Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader and champion of Serb nationalism in its
most diehard form.
Few observers see any prospect of the Bosnian partition plandevised by four
western nations and Russia being accepted in itscurrent form, and there is
scant possibility of the plan's sponsors changing it.
But as French officials have pointed out several times, that does not stop
the warring parties agreeing among themselves to alter the plan - if and
when they all feel that military options have been exhausted.
However the latest developments could have other, much less happy
consequences.
One possibility is that a reversal of the Bosnian Serbs' fortunes will put
President Milosevic, and conceivably his friends in Moscow, under unbearable
pressure to come to the rescue of Mr Karadzic.
Another danger - mentioned recently by General Bertrand de Lapresle, UN
commander in ex-Yugoslavia - is that Moslem military successes will put
strain on the delicate relations between Moslems and Croats.
'If the Moslems have too strong an army, that could frightenthe Bosnian
Croats and render fragile the Croat-Moslem federation,' the French general
recently told the French newspaper Le Monde.
A third possibility is that even if the Bosnian Serbs eventually seek peace
on humiliating terms, there will then be little appetite for compromise
among the Moslems' battle-hardened commanders.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Ross boss sells 2m - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale by Ross Marks of 2m shares in Ross Group, a distribution company,
comes after a big drop in its share price. A year ago, when the price was
around 20p, we monitored considerable director buying. But Ross Group has
had a wide range of problems, most recently in the technical division. The
largest sale of the week was at the Independent Insurance Group where Sir
Iain Noble, a non-executive director, sold 150,000 shares at 249p. He
retains more than 94,000. The company has been on the market since November
1993. Over the past month, its share price has underperformed by a small
margin relative to the market.
Storm Group, which is involved in rights for cartoon-style characters (or
their creators), featured on this list last month when managing director
James Clarke bought 175,000 shares on joining the board. Most recently,
Jerry Alpert, the senior vice-president in the US, sold stock at 11p  - his
entire holding.

FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (9): A
strategy to beat inflation - Rising costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Buying a house is probably the largest capital expenditure most people
expect to make. But if you intend to educate your children privately, you
should not be surprised if school fees come a close second or, depending on
the number of children, even first.
Estimates put the cost of sending a child through primary and secondary
school at Pounds 100,000. The average annual fee for the independent day
schools in this survey is Pounds 4,117, and Pounds 9,914 forboarding
schools.
Some of the best-performing boarding schools are charging fees of more than
Pounds 4,000 per term for the first time this year. These include Eton (2nd:
Pounds 4,128), Winchester (4th: Pounds 4,262), and Roedean (27th: Pounds
4,135). These would make a dent in your income even if your child qualified
for a scholarship.
Boarding-school fees inflation was well above the retail price index in the
early 1990s and still remains higher, although it has slowed down in the
past year. If fees are to rise above inflation and will be paid over a long
period  - at least 10 years  - you may need to plan their payment.
As with any grand operation, a strategy is needed: Keep it simple. Some
financial advisers may bombard you with complicated school-fees plans. If
you do not understand how the plan works forget about the proposed
investment. There is little point in risking learning the hard way once you
come to pay the fees.
Keeping it simple also involves choosing a flexible way to plan. Most
school-fees planning packages are based on the endowment policy but their
main problem can be the lack of flexibility. Mr Anthony Murrell of Knight
Cavendish Information Technology, which has a school-fees software package,
says: 'All too often circumstances can change and the money will be needed
for purposes other than school fees.'
Other schemes are specifically designed to pay school fees, such as
educational trusts. 'Tied schemes usually impose penalties if the money is
not spent on education and they are regarded as fiscally vulnerable because
of their charitable status, which could well be removed by a change in
government,' says Mr Murrell.
It is never too soon to start saving  - the best time is before the child is
even planned. If you have chosen a flexible mix of investments and your
plans change  - your child wins a scholarship or you decide to emigrate  -
you can use the money for something else.
Do not be too speculative. Stock market investments go up and down but
schools demand regular payment. It is best to mix stock market investments,
such as unit or investment trusts held within a personal equity plan (Pep),
with deposit-based investments for a stable backbone.
If you are choosing unit trusts for your Pep you could narrow your choice,
from among the 1,500 or so on offer, to the tracker funds which have lower
charges. Gartmore UK Index which tracks the FT-SE-A All-Share has an annual
fee of 0.5 per cent and no initial charge, combined with top 25 per cent
performance in the UK general sector.
Deposit-based investments include Tessas (tax-exempt special savings
accounts) which allow you to save up to Pounds 9,000 over five years.
Interest is tax-free if the account is held for its full five-year term.
National Savings products are another stabilising force. The new 42nd-issue
savings certificates pay a tax-free 5.85 per cent a year when held for five
years. The return is equivalent to 9.75 per cent gross for a 40 per cent
taxpayer (7.8 per cent gross for a lower-rate taxpayer). The maximum holding
is Pounds 10,000 but husband and wife can each have a holding. The
Children's Bonus Bond (Issue G) pays 7.85 per cent a year if held for five
years but the maximum holding is Pounds 1,000.
Bear the interest rate cycle in mind. Now that interest rates look more
likely to move up, it is probably a good idea not to put everything into
fixed-rate savings, to avoid losing out on the possibility of higher
guaranteed rates in the future.
Parents worried that their school fees will escalate might decide it is a
good time to fix mortgage payments. If interest rates do rise, you have the
security of knowing what your monthly mortgage payments are  - even if
school fees increase.
About two-thirds of parents sending children to private schools have not
made financial plans to do so. If you are one of them and need to top up
payments made out of income, you are likely to be restricted to taking out a
loan.
Claremont Savile, independent financial adviser, runs a scheme for the
Independent Schools Information Service (Isis) which is most suitable for
those with a large amount of equity in their home. The mortgages are
provided by Citibank Mortgage or Halifax building society and structured so
that funds can be drawn down to meet the cost of fees up to four times a
year. The maximum loan is 85 per cent of the property's value.
The mortgages are not based on endowment policies. Instead, Claremont Savile
advises the use of a pension where possible and, depending on circumstances,
a free-standing additional voluntary contribution, as the most tax-efficient
way of repaying, although other options, such as a Pep can also be used.
Finally, there is a limited amount of central and local government help. The
Assisted Places Scheme pays for children from low-income families to go to
independent schools, while some local authorities may be able to give
scholarships or bursaries. Charitable bodies, some international
organisations and professional associations may also be able to provide
help. Further details about the relevant bodies to contact are available
from Isis.

FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (8): Beyond
cramming - The rise of tutorial colleges as alternatives to school
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the exam, will we need to draw the curves with a ruler?
That question, asked in an economics session at Davies's College near
Russell Square in London, suggests that tutorial college students are more
exam-orientated than most. The tutor, incidentally, said that it would be a
little excessive.
Tutorial colleges are odd institutions, but have built up a reliable market
in the past few years. Typically based in large Georgian houses in central
London, or in regional academic centres such as Oxford, Cambridge or Exeter,
colleges charge high fees in return for working students hard in a relaxed
environment.
They do not fit standard A-level performance tables, despite their
concentration on exams  - for example many students are making their second
or third attempts, and may be taking only one subject  - and so have not
been included in the FT-1,000. However, they do provide a distinct option
for two separate markets.
The first is as an alternative to school for sixth-formers reacting against
school discipline. Most of them offer two-year courses, with extras to
improve students' chances of reaching higher education. These may include
tuition in information technology, and general studies  - although not
usually the wealth of activities provided in a school. This is most
attractive to students who have lost patience with boarding schools or who
are faring badly at day schools.
The second is for people whose A-level grades were too low the first time.
Many are would-be medics who must achieve A and B grades. Others are simply
aiming for grades to secure them a university place.
Discipline is relaxed, but only because tutors know they can rely on
parental support. At Mander Portman Woodward, in Cromwell Road, west London
 - the biggest UK tutorial college  - a secretary knocks on the door of each
class 10 minutes after it begins and if anyone is absent their parents are
telephoned immediately.
This gives tutors the confidence that their students are working, so they
can use teaching methods which could seem progressive in another context.
There are no restrictions on uniform  - lurid hairstyles which would not be
tolerated at traditional public schools are allowed without a murmur  - and
students are allowed to smoke during breaks. According to Fiona Dowding,
co-principal of MPW, this gives students less to rebel against.
Teaching usually involves the students and the tutor sitting around a table.
Class sizes are small  - MPW limits them to seven, and Davies's to eight  -
so tuition sessions are swift and intense, with students usually on first
name terms with their tutors. More traditionally, there are weekly tests,
and personal tutors provide advice on how pupils should plan their study.
Is this 'cramming'? Dowding accepts the word to describe re-take classes.
'That's plainly what we're offering,' she says.
But she denies another claim, that tutorial colleges are anti-intellectual.
Even in a re-take class for history, students are bombarded with topics and
asked their relevance to set questions. While it is directly linked to the
exam, it is intellectually taxing, and requires genuine understanding of the
subject, Dowding says.
Most colleges have also diversified from re-take 'cramming'. Two-year
courses are just as intense, with students plied with questions, but they
are far less rigorously focused on the exam.
Fees are roughly equivalent to those of boarding schools. At MPW, for
example, a student taking three A-levels over two years would pay Pounds
2,887 per term  - equivalent to Pounds 17,322 for the full two-year course.
This is an expensive alternative to two years in sixth form at an
independent day school.
Winter retakes are charged by the subject  - the exam in January will cost
Pounds 1,685. For November, fees are slightly less at Pounds 1,106 per term.
At Davies's, retakes cost Pounds 1,500 per subject.
Choosing a tutorial college is a difficult process which often starts with
recommendations from secondary school teachers. Many colleges are members of
the Conference for Independent Further Education (Cife), and results are
independently audited by Gabbitas Educational Consultants. These are
provided in terms of grade improvement  - most colleges aim to add at least
two grades to each A-level taken  - and in overall 'raw' figures.
Both are sources of information for people considering a tutorial college.
Gabbitas suggests a series of steps to consider. Parents should check which
examination boards colleges use, as only three boards offer exams in the
winter, and not in all subjects. Prospectuses also require scrutiny, as fees
are not always directly comparable.
Parents should also beware of pirates. Colleges with fewer than five
students under the age of 16 do not need to be registered by the Department
for Education. It is therefore advisable to ask if they are accredited
either by Cife, or the British Accreditation Council  - if they are not, ask
why.

FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (7): Calling
at half-way houses - The appeal of informality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If pupils want to escape school at 16, but want a 'halfway house' before
going to university, sixth-form colleges may be the answer.
More than 100 have been set up in the past two decades by local authorities
mostly trying to save money  - they can be more economical than maintaining
small sixth forms at schools.
The government is showing signs of halting this, with the Department for
Education giving the go-ahead for several 11-16 schools to start sixth
forms. Former education secretary, John Patten, had said they were like 'a
body without a head'. All sixth-form colleges have been removed from local
authority control, and are funded on the same basis as further education
colleges.
But the colleges, at least in some cases, are beginning to show their worth.
Judging them for league table purposes is difficult because their large size
 - one of their prime advantages as it allows them to provide a broader,
more flexible curriculum  - makes it harder for them to sustain a high
average points score.
Most are non-selective and cater for students doing mainly vocational
courses. It is common for students to take a vocational course plus an
A-level in maths, which would show up badly in the FT rankings.
Some further education colleges offer no A-levels, or only offer them as
access courses for adults, which should not be compared with teaching
18-year-olds. Others offer full-time A-level courses as an addition to
vocational training, but these are not included, as it would be unfair to
take A-level results as a measure of overall performance.
The Department for Education's league tables tackle these problems by
quoting the average UCAS points for candidates who attempt two or more
A-levels, and for those who attempt fewer than two. This separates those
taking an A-level to top up a vocational course from students taking a fully
academic course.
The sixth-form colleges in the FT's table (above) are all primarily
academic, and their results cover all pupils who attempted A-levels. Once it
is taken into account that they are offering broad curricula and entering as
many as 700 candidates each year, some of their results seem spectacular.
As usual, catchment areas are the prime determinant of success, with
Cambridge's Hills Road Sixth Form College topping the rankings.
Colchester Sixth Form College is perhaps the most dramatic example of the
benefits of large scale. Entering around 700 candidates each year, it takes
students regularly from nine schools, and attracts many more from outside
its catchment.
It offers 40 A-level subjects including law, physical education, and
philosophy. Students are also offered 19 subjects at AS-level, allowing them
more opportunities to achieve a balance between arts and sciences than with
conventional A-levels.
The college also regularly manages to find places at Oxford and Cambridge
for about 15 students each year. Its top 100 candidates this year gained an
average of 33.07 UCAS points, which ranks the college among academic giants
like Westminster and St Paul's.
This was achieved despite the presence in Colchester of two of the country's
most successful grammar schools, which both take 100 pupils each year.
Although the college is over-subscribed, many students have failed a grammar
school entrance exam.
Principal John Edwards says that some parents are worried by the informality
 - there is no uniform, and staff are addressed by their first names.
Internal politics also resembles a university union, with elected student
representatives having a voice in college policies. During breaks the
college, based around old school buildings in the centre of Colchester,
feels more like a university than a school.
Its size helps in other respects. Colchester finished third in the national
swimming championships  - behind Millfield and Kelly, both of which
specialise in the sport.
The advantages of scale are great, and league tables often fail to reflect
them. The UK's largest comprehensive - the Stantonbury Campus in Milton
Keynes  - also resembles a university more than a school, with fine theatre
and sporting facilities available to the community. Its aggregate results
may look less impressive but still include examples of excellence.
Elsewhere, urban schools have countered threats to their sixth forms by
starting sixth-form consortia and by pooling resources, allowing students to
take an A-level at another school if there is insufficient demand for it at
their own.
One outlandishly named example in the FT-1,000 is La SWAP in north-west
London. This is a joint operation of La Sainte Union, William Ellis, Acland
Burghley, and Parliament Hill schools in Camden, London. Its position,
barely below average for the FT-1000, in an area where it competes against
some of the most selective academic schools, is also better than it appears.

FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (3):
Scotland ready to rule - Why the Scottish system is increasingly envied
south of the border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Alumni of Scottish independent schools may soon be running the country.
Prince Charles is an old boy of Gordonstoun, one of the remotest schools in
the UK based in the northern Highlands, while Tony Blair, the leader of the
opposition, is a graduate of Fettes, an Edinburgh boarding school.
However, Scottish schools with the exception of Gordonstoun, are not
included in the FT-1,000 as they offer Scottish qualifications. Many offer
A-levels, but Gordonstoun is the only one to do so exclusively. It is ranked
386th, but the philosophy of its founders was ambitious and the school is
even less likely than most to accept judgment purely in terms of its
academic results.
The others offer more of a 'mixed economy' of A-levels and Scottish
qualifications, which are increasingly envied south of the border.
Proposals by the Headmaster's Conference  - which includes the top four
schools in the FT-1,000  - to reform the A-level structure to allow more
flexibility, and by the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals,
representing universities, to reform A-level syllabuses so that five
subjects become the norm, would both mean moving in the direction of the
Scottish system.
However, the mixed Scottish system defies adequate ranking. There is no
agreed conversion table between highers and A-levels  - although highers are
accepted at most English universities  - and different schools might
legitimately have different approaches.
Some take highers later because they need more time, others to take extra
subjects. For some the final year is irrelevant as they already have the
fifth-year highers needed to go to a Scottish university.
Therefore, the FT has made no attempt to rank them academically. Examination
of the proportions gaining A- and B-grades in highers does, however, suggest
that the big-city day schools tend to fare best.
Scotland has arguably the two most fiercely competitive markets for day
pupils in Britain, in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Both have several
well-established day schools fishing from a small pool of families able to
pay independent school fees. As the table shows, Dundee and Aberdeen also
have big independent day schools.
The boarding schools are more eclectic. Fettes, a Victorian-Gothic
construction near the centre of Edinburgh, has a strong high-church
tradition. Glenalmond  - with architecture designed to match Trinity
College, Cambridge  - was set up by Gladstone, the former prime minister,
and stands in dramatic open Perthshire countryside.
Despite the apparently remote locations, most of the boarding schools are
within easy reach of the bulk of the Scottish population.
In practice, most boarders tend to be either from Scotland or the North of
England, while there is also a pocket of 'expatriate Scots' from London.
Glenalmond is trying to encourage more English pupils by promoting the
advantages of the Scottish system  - which used to be regarded as a problem.
It says the flexibility will attract many, while the rigorous standards
needed for medicine degree courses might be easier to achieve if taken
gradually via highers.
+++++++ End of Leg 5 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Scottish schools also offer a lot for those who want clean air and wide open
spaces, and the Duke of Edinburgh's award scheme is usually on offer.
Gordonstoun has a 150-acre estate, including over a mile of shoreline on the
Moray firth, while the big-city day schools also offer pupils outdoors
pursuits.
Kelvinside Academy, a Glasgow boys' school, has its own house in the
Cairngorms for skiing and hill-walking  - a valuable opportunity for
inner-city boys.
Fees for both boarding and day schools are in line with rates charged for
independent schools elsewhere in the UK. Last year's average boarding fee
per term was Pounds 3,259, compared with Pounds 3,261 for the nation as a
whole.
Day schools tend to be cheaper than in England, at Pounds 1,222 per term
(against an average of Pounds 1,262).
Full details of schools' performance in GCSEs and Standard grades, taken by
16-year-olds, and in Certificate of Sixth-Year Studies, are available from
the Scottish Council of Independent Schools. Scottish Council of Independent
Schools, Floor 2/1, 11 Castle Street, Edinburgh EH2. 031 220 2106.

FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (4):
Scottish 'Higher' system offers students greater flexibility than English
A-levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Scottish examination system differs radically from the one used south of
the border.
At 16, Scottish pupils usually take Standard grade exams, rather than the
GCSEs offered in England and Wales. Studies in the Scots' fifth and sixth
years  - lower and upper sixth in England  - offer more variety than
A-levels.
Usually, public exams are taken at the end of both years. In either year,
pupils can take Scottish Certificate of Education Higher Grade exams
('Highers'). Typically, pupils will attempt four or five subjects in the
fifth year, which will form the backbone of their university applications.
It is also possible to attempt Highers over two years, taking them in the
sixth year, or to take extra subjects in that year. Alternatively, students
can take the Scottish Certificate of Sixth Year Studies, more specialised
and intended as a bridge to higher education  - figures for this
qualification are not included here.
Finally, several institutions  - mostly boarding schools  - offer A-levels
and Scottish qualifications.
For each qualification, a school is excluded from the table if it has made
fewer than 10 entries. In each case, we print the number of entries made,
and the number resulting in the top A- and B-grades.

FT  29 OCT 94 / FT Schools 1000 - Survey of Secondary Education (1): Always
top of the class - A group of mainly single-sex, big-city day schools are
well entrenched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In this third year of the FT-1,000 schools guide, readers might be forgiven
for thinking they have seen it all before. League tables of schools based on
A-level performance are an established feature of the educational landscape,
and are telling a consistent story.
Fixed at the top of the table are a group of mainly single-sex big-city day
schools. They are very selective, very academic and have traditions so well
entrenched that standards are not going to change. For the record,
Westminster this year overtook St Paul's for the top position, but these
minor annual fluctuations need be of no concern to parents.
In the state sector, a select group of grammar schools again appears at the
top of the table. Regular readers will be used to names such as King Edward
VI Grammar School in Chelmsford, the Judd School in Tonbridge, and
Colchester County High, all selective, and established performers.
The state sector's performance, compared with independents, was similar to
last year's. There were eight in the top 100, the same as last year, and 20
in the top 200, down from 23. This year's top state school (Henrietta
Barnett, a grammar school for girls in Hampstead, London) ranks 53rd,
compared with last year's 37th by another girls' grammar, Colchester County
High.
GCSE performance tables focused attention on the battle of the sexes earlier
this year, as independent girls' schools dominated. At A-level, the gap is
narrower, but in the independent sector, girls' schools have marginally
out-performed boys', with results 13 per cent better than average compared
to the boys' 11 per cent.
As league tables have become established, educationalists' attitude to them
has changed.
From initial hostility  - most heads still believe that they do more harm
than good  - there is acceptance that the statistics will not go away.
Rather than fighting them, teachers now want to improve them.
Tim Brighouse, the chief education officer of Birmingham, who successfully
sued former education secretary John Patten for libel, sums up the mood: 'I
think we now want more information rather than less to be published, and
that would allow a more rounded picture.'
For example, rankings might take into account the social background of the
pupils, or their academic ability at the time they started at the school.
Both are hard to measure, but heavily affect final outcomes.
While A-levels and GCSEs provide well-understood performance indicators,
there are few public tests taken by younger children, so it is hard to
measure the value which secondary schools have added. Measures of social
deprivation are controversial.
A ranking which took these factors into account would produce a very
different table  - which might come closer to telling parents what they
truly need to know. Some comprehensives' results appear spectacular when the
domestic circumstances of their pupils are taken into account.
For example, Tamsyn Imison, head of Hampstead comprehensive, says the
school's name is misleading. She suggests it might be more accurately called
'Cricklewood High'. Of the school's 1,254 students, 55 per cent speak
English as a second language, using any of 80 different languages at home.
There are 150 refugees at the school.
Take this into account, and Hampstead's ranking of 414th, above average for
the 1,000 schools in the survey, looks very impressive. It might do even
better in a 'value-added' table.
Selective grammar schools, whose performances in league tables seem rather
stronger, take a similar attitude. David Levin, headmaster of Royal Grammar
School, High Wycombe  - top boys' state school for the second year running
 -says the school aims to select the top 25 per cent of boys academically in
its catchment area, and there is no point in comparing it with
comprehensives or 'super-stream' schools which take less than 10 per cent of
the age group.
Attempts to rank schools according to the value they have added between GCSE
and A-level reveal a confusing picture. Figures produced by the Department
for Education suggest that independent schools add more than state schools
between GCSE and A-level.
A more detailed survey by Peter Tymms of Newcastle university suggests a
much more limited effect. Comparing exam results achieved at state schools
with independent schools which were part of the Assisted Places Scheme, he
found that pupils in sixth-form colleges and independent schools were likely
to get 0.3 and 0.25 of a grade better respectively than pupils who had
started out with similar GCSEs at a comprehensive.
It also showed that students' chances of gaining a high A-level grade were
related to the average GCSE grades of the whole group. For every GCSE grade,
overall, by which a schools' A-level candidates were above the average, each
student would be expected to gain an extra 0.37 of an A-level grade.
This can be explained by large groups of academically able students
'sparking' each other. Tymms suggests this might lead to two separate
policies: 'Does it make sense to separate out the very able so that they can
feed, intellectually, on one another or should their beneficial influence be
as widely spread as possible?'
Such complex analysis may make the existing FT-1,000 obsolete, as it does
not measure value-added. However, it provides a sophisticated analysis of
schools' A-level results. Compiled after months of research, questionnaires
were sent to the 1,100 top-performing state schools as measured by last
year's government statistics. These represent one third of state schools
teaching A-levels.
In addition, the Independent Schools' Information Service (Isis) supplied
compatible data on more than 500 of its members. Head teachers were sent
proofs before the tables were finalised, to allow them to correct errors.
No school with fewer than 10 A-level candidates is included in our table, as
they are prone to fluctuations which are not statistically significant.
Only A-level results count towards a school's ranking. Schools which took
part in this year's pilot of advanced General National Vocational
Qualifications, intended as a vocational alternative to A-levels and good
for university entrance, have not had these results included. Only 3,000
students took the qualifications this year. But 50,000 students should be
leaving the sixth form with GNVQs in 1996. If this happens, A-level league
tables will need drastic adjustment.
The International Baccalaureate is also growing in popularity. The survey
includes independent schools which offer both A-levels and the IB, but have
not covered those which offer only the IB.
Rank positions represent a weighting of the average number of UCAS points
achieved per pupil (the quantity of grades attained) with the average number
of UCAS points per subject entry (the quality of grades attained). Grades
for general studies A-level are not included, as many universities are not
prepared to accept it. This leads to some discrepancies with the
government's data due to be published next month.
Rank positions greatly exaggerate differences between schools, particularly
in the middle of the range. For example, those ranked between 307th and
680th all achieved results within 10 per cent of the average  - roughly
equivalent to each pupil achieving three grade Cs.
The FT score is therefore more important than rankings. It has been scaled
so that a score of 1.00 represents the average performance of all the
schools considered for the FT-1000. The table opposite enables you to
convert FT scores into average A-level grades attained.
Also note the number of candidates a school has entered, as it is harder to
maintain a high average over a large number of pupils. King Edward's School,
Birmingham, was top overall on average over the past five years. It expanded
its intake, from four to five forms, seven years ago. That meant an increase
from 104 to 127 in its number of A-level candidates and a slight drop in the
degree to which it selected pupils. So, its slight fall this year to 12th
signifies very little.
Boarding schools, which have sustained falls of more than 5 per cent in
boarding numbers on average in the past two years, are also becoming less
selective. Their market has contracted as parents still resident in the UK
now mostly want to live within about an hour of the school.
Jonathan Leigh, head of Blundell's in Devon, a boarding school with a
smaller catchment area within Britain than many, says many boarding schools
are no longer truly selective although applicants sit the common entrance
exam. His school has started recruiting pupils from Russia.
As more statistics on pupils' achievements when they start school become
available, so we should be able to provide better guidance on which schools
add most value to the academic attainments a child brings with them on their
first day. This survey confirms the existence of metropolitan centres of
excellence, such as Westminster and St Paul's.
What it is beginning to suggest is that comprehensives and community
colleges in rural areas, which can afford to be far less selective, can
achieve similar excellence. If all the circumstances could be taken into
account, the performance of schools such as Queen Elizabeth's community
college in Crediton, Devon (554th), and West Somerset community college,
Minehead (562nd) might look just as good. Sadly, heads of state schools in
Cornwall decided not to co-operate with the survey.

FT  29 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: Corrupt Europe, sleazy Britain - How
nations respond to misbehaviour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Corruption pages proliferate. They appear all over western Europe. One
wonders at times which country produces which comment: 'Shady financing . .
. is eating away at the state. That means many existing political careers,
if not all, have been made in dubious circumstances. The discredit which has
rebounded on the political class is now being purged. Such a medical
exercise, however disagreeable, can only end by pepping up a profession
which has terrible need of it.'
That appeared in Liberation in Paris this week. It could have appeared in
Spain or Italy. But not in Britain. In Britain there is sleaze, not
corruption. Here, for the benefit of non-British readers, is an account of
what sleaze might be in Britain.
Mr Kettle MP and the businessman Mr Black become firm friends while sharing
a tent on a camping holiday. Subsequently, Kettle is made a consultant for
Black and asks questions in parliament, at Pounds 2,000 a time, about the
poor management of the state-owned British Pots Corporation. Kettle rises to
industry secretary and privatises BPC. Black becomes chairman. Kettle
retires from the House and, as Lord Kettle, is made a director of British
Pots PLC. The company donates Pounds 250,000 to the Conservative Party.
Black, now knighted, retires to Liechtenstein with a Pounds 3m handout from
the company. Lord Kettle heads the new Suburban Government Commission. Black
is appointed by that commission to be chairman of the Surrey Development
Agency, a one-day a week job paying Pounds 50,000 a year.
None of this is true, and even if it were it would not be illegal or
corrupt. So the government has set up a standing commission to stamp it out.
I hope all is now clear.
In France, by contrast, nearly every report of corruption is leading to
prosecution. The spread of corruption is blamed on decentralisation. In
recent years the central government has handed many of its functions over to
regional bodies which have had considerable sums to spend on local
development.
Fortunately, the head of an institute of decentralisation, Pierre Richard,
was there to put the record straight this week. In Liberation he wrote that
extending powers to the regions had nothing to do with corruption. 'Let us
say loud and clear: the tree which is composed of certain officials who
have, either through imprudence or indelicacy, sinned, cannot conceal the
forest of honest and efficient managers.'
The accompanying story was that of the gigantic bridge at Nantes. In 1987,
'commissions' worth anything between FFr7m and FFr20m were allegedly, and
possibly indelicately, offered to those who might have had some influence
over the contract. The papers have already regaled us with the complex
history of the earlier Nantes water supply contract. The 'one tree of
imprudence' seems to cast a long shadow.
But Richard has a number of solutions. He wants to create a ministry run by
an administrative judge, 'organised in specialist sections to deal with
public contracts, urban affairs etc and accountable directly to local
citizens'. That would be underpinned by more powerful regional audit
offices. And there should be an increase in 'the powers and prerogatives of
the central anti-corruption service'. Most people, I imagine, would prefer
corruption to anything like that.
Governments in such circumstances usually turn to this sort of thing - the
'crackdown' approach, pioneered by Italy. But it easily gets out of hand. An
economy can run into difficulties when a large proportion of its most
dynamic and enterprising citizens languish behind bars pending further
inquiries.
Then there is the alternative, but doomed, 'return to morality' solution. In
Britain there was the ill-starred 'back to basics' campaign which started a
year ago and collapsed three months later. Corruption was not its target but
it ran into the sleaze factor. In Italy 'back to basics' was translated as a
fascist renascence. In France it is promoted by the prime minister, Edouard
Balladur, under the formula known as 'the moralisation of public life.'
One has to turn to the unscathed Germans for guidance. The Paris
correspondent of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote this week that
Italy had provided an example to France - once judges and magistrates had a
free hand they could really tackle the problem. But Balladur's approach was
failing because it lacked an essential element. 'What is decisive in the
struggle against corruption is the political will for sharper sanctions.'
Except in Britain, of course. There all measures have been taken to ensure
that nothing untoward continues to happen.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Private View: A sanitary worker in the gene pool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Genetics has had an ugly history, dating from the days when theories were
built on a naive interpretation of Darwin - or pure prejudice - rather than
on scientific knowledge.
Today there is a great deal more knowledge and the promise of medical
breakthroughs. But there is also, says Steven Rose, a danger that bad old
thinking will be revived while irresolvable ethical dilemmas are being
created.
Professor Rose is a biologist of the brain who studies memory by teaching
day-old chicks (they learn fast and don't need telling twice), then opening
up their brains to see what has been going on inside.
He is probably better known, however, for the clarity of his popular science
writing (The Making of Memory won last year's Science Book Prize) and better
still for his campaign against what he calls the 'neurogenetic
determinists'.
By this he means the people who, in a world desperate for simple
explanations and instant cures, claim the answer lies in the genes.
I asked him: are you saying their claims are wrong, or merely premature?
'Some are premature, some are right, some are wrong,' he replied. 'But in
all cases I would argue they are being grossly oversold and overhyped.'
He went on: 'Although all of us use the phrase 'genes for . . .' as a
shorthand, of course there is no gene for anything in this sense.
'What a gene does is code for a particular protein not a piece of protein.
People talk about genes for blue or brown eye-colour. In fact many thousands
of genes go to determine the pathway which ends up with a blue or brown
eye-colour. What's different between people with blue eyes and brown eyes is
that one of the genes along the pathway is different. So it's a gene which
helps determine a difference, rather than a gene 'for' something.'
It sounded like a distinction without a difference until Rose explained that
even 'single-gene' medical disorders can adopt many forms, while their
severity depends on all the other genes in the system.
Rose is saying that the answers provided by molecular biology can only be
partial answers. Organisms - especially human beings - need to be studied as
a whole.
'Genes are one-dimensional, while the organism is four-dimensional and we
don't go from one dimension to four in a very simple way,' he said.
Gene-sequencing was a skilled but repetitive business quite divorced from
the organism in which the biochemistry was going on.
'That really worries me as a biologist, as an educationalist, quite apart
from the politics.
'It was Jim Watson (co-discoverer of the DNA double helix) who said that it
was so simple it could be done by a team of monkeys . . . It wasn't me who
said that.' He laughed.
Even supposing a clear causal link between gene patterns and medical
conditions, what was to be done with the knowledge? Suppose you could
predict that a foetus had a 30 per cent chance of developing schizophrenia
at the age of 18, the knowledge itself would change the way the child grew
up. Would it lessen, or increase, the chances of schizophrenia developing?
'My criticism of molecular geneticists is that they are really handling
human time-bombs of information and they don't begin to understand the
complexities of what they are trying to unravel, even in the simple cases.'
As for research into the genetics of social behaviour, Prof Rose is not so
much alarmed as scornful.
'To look for a genetic explanation for phenomena like violence in society is
the classical story of the drunk looking for the key under the lamp-post
because that is where the light is.
'But if the key isn't there, then it's stupid to look there. It's
clever-stupid but it's stupid nonetheless.'
Researchers had claimed there are genes 'for' homosexuality, aggression,
alcoholism, even homelessness. This, said Rose, is the fallacy of
reification - making a thing out of a process. Congruences or consequences
were mistaken for causes, methodology was elevated into a philosophy.
If there were gene markers which tallied with the experience of being
homosexual that was 'an interesting observation,' he said. 'But it doesn't
account for the nature of homosexuality in society, it doesn't provide an
explanation of the meaning of homosexuality or a statement of how we should
treat it.'
In the US, where the homicide rate among 16 to 19-year-old males had doubled
in 10 years, they were worried about violence.
'I say as a scientist there is no conceivable genetic explanation for that
doubling. It's stupid to look at genetics. We should look at the guns, or
the social conditions which foster violence.'
Rose is a materialist with no time for supernatural explanations. But he is
a materialist who wants to distinguish the levels - and define the limits -
of scientific explanation.
'Look, I wouldn't want to evoke biology to explain the Tel Aviv bombing,' he
said. 'Or the conflict between the Serbians and the Moslems. I don't think
measuring dopamine levels in Dr Karadzic's brain is actually going to help
tell us anything.'
After a First in biochemistry at Cambridge and research at Imperial College,
London, Rose was recruited by the Open University. His wife Hilary (he calls
her his 'partner') is a feminist sociology professor; Rose says he is much
influenced by the 'feminist cognitive critique'.
He pays attention when animal rights campaigners tell him that cutting the
heads off day-old chicks diminishes him as a human being, and was a founder
of the Society for Social Responsibility in Science.
Brought up in an Orthodox Jewish family in London he was, he says, an
atheist at the age of eight. On that birthday he was given a chemistry set
and a copy of Darwin's Origin of Species. His father, returning from the
second world war, was for a while anti-Fascist organiser for the association
of Jewish ex-servicemen.
With this kind of curriculum vitae, it seemed fair to ask him whether his
criticism of molecular biology is, at bottom, emotional.
'Some of the questions being asked have the appearance of being scientific,
but are not,' he said. 'In other cases it is desperately important to get
the right answer - the causes of schizophrenia, for example. But studying
the genetics of schizophrenia is not the best way of doing it.
'I'm not against doing it. But I am in favour of assembling research
priorities, and our priorities have to be set in a social context. People
say Dollars 3bn for the human genome programme is trivial. But to shift
funding away from research into the whole organism is I think a mistake in
priorities.'
Is it that politicians do not understand biology or that biologists are
highly political people?
'Oh, I think that all scientists are in that sense highly political. You
have to argue for funding. You go where the money is.'
I reminded him of a letter he and his wife wrote to The Guardian earlier
this month protesting about a 'provocative display of authoritarian police
power' at the last demonstration against the Criminal Justice Bill.
The professor laughed ruefully, but remained unabashed. 'My whole life has
been a passionate concern with two things at the same time,' he said. 'One
is to understand the world and the second is to change the world where I see
what I believe to be injustices. Science is a way of doing both.'
We discussed the revival in the US of the debate about IQ, race and class, a
touchstone in any genetic debate.
Rose said it was a fallacy to think that IQ was a fixed property.
Intelligence, like memory, was not 'a lump of something' and the IQ test was
a variable device useful for particular purposes.
'If you say that IQ is fixed in the genes then you have an ideological
defence of the status quo of a society divided by wealth, poverty, class,
race and gender and you offer the possibility of spurious technological
fixes.'
Are you not politically predisposed to believe that people of all races are
born on average equal?
'What I am scientifically predisposed to do is to reject the concept of race
in the genetic sense as having any real meaning.
'Race clearly has a great deal of social relevance. What defines it in
contemporary society has very little to do with genetics. That is, the gene
distribution and gene frequences between any two 'white' individuals are as
different as between any white and any black individual.'
Rose does not believe in arguing about nature versus nurture. His ambition
is what he calls a 'synthetic biology' in which different levels of
explanation, from the molecular to the social, are conjoined. I asked him if
he had any sympathy for the so-called anti-science movement.
'Because western science has insisted on this rigidly reductionist approach
it does prevent us understanding the richness of human experience.
'I think there is an understanding of the human condition which is given to
us by novels, by philosophers, by religious writing, and one can't discount
that.
'You may argue that you can understand more about memory by reading volume
one of A la recherche du temps perdu where Proust rediscovers memory in the
taste of the madeleine cake than by anything I'm doing with the chicks.
'People understand different things about memory, and I can't handle those
in terms of biochemistry. What I want to do, desperately, is to be able to
put the two of them together, to unite the fractured halves of our lives, to
put science back into the service of humanity, to give an integrated
understanding of the world.
'In that sense one's got to listen to what the critics of science are saying
and try and address their concerns even if you don't agree with their
solutions.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / One last drive to the end of the road: The car has smoked
itself to death. Peter Aspden laments the passing of a furtive pleasure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If it is true that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the car
culture, then be sure that it will not go out without an explosion of blown
gaskets and a few righteous puffs of blue smoke. For hell - or the M25 -
hath no fury like a motorist, surrounded by traffic cones, juggernauts and
vapid environmentalists, being asked to pay more for the 'privilege' of
using his or her car.
This anger is not so hard to understand. Bizarrely, taking a car out for a
spin has come to represent one of the few expressions of personal freedom
left in a world of increasing uniformity and staleness.
Perhaps only the historians of the 25th century will be able to tell the
story with the necessary degree of detachment; how strapping yourself into a
confined space for a couple of hours came to symbolise the ultimate in
liberation from modern life's quotidian drudgery.
But such are the claims made for car culture. Listening to a mournful radio
phone-in following the report of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution, which had the temerity to pronounce that Britain's road-obsessed
transport programme was unsustainable, it was as if we were being asked to
sacrifice the most inalienable of our rights.
Well, I like a whirl in my Alfa like the next man (and, my goodness, what a
boy's world it is). But the man ringing the radio station from his mobile
telephone in the middle of his traffic-jammed route to central London must
surely have realised how absurd he sounded when he talked, like an old
trucker, of 'the freedom of the roads'.
In truth, the romantic view of car culture, the world of throbbing engines,
hair-raising curves and consummate clutch control, is fast dying on its
wheels. There is not much fun to be had in driving today's bland, sanitised
cars; indeed, to talk of a 'culture' at all is to evoke a whimsical image
far removed from the belchingly slow reality of the average city vehicle,
power-steering (what a mocking misnomer) its way at 7mph into another
gormless queue.
Car designers have realised this. After a brief spasm of 'supercar' madness
in the 1980s, they have settled into their more pragmatic briefs of
producing neat, small, efficient cars for the 1990s.
Advertisers, ahead of the game as always, have plucked out a series of neat,
small, pretty girls to promote these otherwise charmless items. Nicole, in
her oh-so-wicked fling through the Provencal countryside, is the future of
car culture; slinky, surreptitious, a bit on the side, like a quick drag on
a Gauloise.
Soon, cars will become so naughty and so compact that we will deny that we
possess one at all, only to disappear for a couple of hours to a concealed
entrance, like the launchpad of Thunderbird Two, for some serious
clandestine pleasure.
Of course eventually, no one will be able, nor feel the need to drive
because we shall have a perfect public transport system. But we shall just
sit there, on a specially-painted double yellow line, challenging the world
at large to come and give us a ticket if it dares] It will be the
quintessential free thinker's act of civil disobedience, recalling a world
when the boundaries of state power were drawn well beyond the twinkling
horizon of the next service station.
In the meantime, we are stuck with what we have got: too few roads, too many
fumes, tempers fraying and time running out. When they all come together, as
they presently do if you are trying to drive into Heathrow Airport, for
example, they represent the very opposite of freedom, the flip-side of
culture, the most appalling example of over-consumption and stress
mis-management you could ever hope to see.
Political will is at last catching up with the public perception that the
cost of the motorist's freedom has simply grown too high to bear. It is time
for all of us, macho boys and furtive girls, to grow up.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Fashion: A feel for the rhythm - How the catwalk designs
make their way into the real world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you were an indefatigable fashion-watcher you could have sat through more
than 150 shows in the three cities - Milan, London and Paris - which have so
far held their spring collections.
If, that is, you could put up with the long waits for the shows to start,
the rude security men, the hassle of evicting interlopers from your seat
and, at Vivienne Westwood's show in Paris, the stampede of uninvited
students who stormed the barricades. And today, you would be starting
another week's onslaught in New York.
You would, if you were a top buyer, be trying to make sense of this
maelstrom of creative input knowing that your decision to back certain
trends could directly affect both your company's profits and your career.
Attuned to the deeper rhythms of fashion, the buyer tries to pinpoint what
will be significant in 'real life' while bearing in mind those first
news-page images which can alter current dress almost instantly.
Buyers normally go to the shows of the designers their stores support, plus
those they might in future. They are, one reminded me, 'invited to press
shows out of courtesy. Our real work is done at the showroom where all the
catwalk fantasy is stripped away'.
They rely to some extent on the independents, who are one step further back
in the fashion chain, and who offer buyers advice.
Journalists on trade magazines or consultants to stores begin their
forecasting at least six months ahead of the shows, by going to the fabric
exhibitions where the designers themselves seek inspiration. By the time of
the shows they already have an idea which way the fashion wind is blowing
and can put designer fantasies into commercial context.
We asked experts for their views on the spring look and its significance to
the ordinary woman's wardrobe, and to suggest autumn buys for an instant
update. Real life may, as one of them points out, 'move more slowly than the
fashion world thinks, always a season behind the shows', but a consensus
emerges from the welter of ideas despite widely varying interpretations.
That overworked word 'glamour' best describes the image of fashion's
inevitable swing away from the years of increasing casualness which
culminated in deconstruction and grunge. But within the context of glamour -
which essentially means more care over hair, make-up, choice of accessories
and cut - it is proportion and fabric which count.
Skirt length is a non-issue, as Karl Lagerfeld pointedly illustrated in his
three collections. His own label and Chloe included on-knee and
calf-lengths, while Chanel was resolutely short because that is what its
customers demand.
So choose what suits you and proportion jacket and shoes accordingly.
Knee-length looks freshest with a heeled shoe but this need not be a
towering stiletto.
The much-hyped retro look can also be moulded to suit you. Skilful
old-fashioned tailoring is back, with the hour-glass silhouette of narrow,
sharply-defined shoulders and emphasised hips that Vivienne Westwood foresaw
with last season's 'bustles'.
It reaches its apogee in highly-mannered, perfectly-cut costumes, complete
with 1950s accessories, from new British Designer of the Year John Galliano,
who seems determined to put the 'haute' back into couture.
But the best collections, such as Westwood, Gaultier, Versace, Dries van
Noten and Ann Demeulemeester, use historical elements and make them look
modern. Jean Paul Gaultier, often a creative catalyst, gave a lesson in
individualisation by taking shapes from every decade of the century and
Gaultier-ising them with his signature fabrics and cut.
Shock-value transparency and high-shine fabrics are his statement on the
1990s and how right he is.
High-tech fabrics, powered on by plastic at Helmut Lang and paillettes at
Lacroix and Montana, are indicative but the real-wardrobe versions will be
sateen, glazed linen or Chanel's cellophane braid rather than vinyl.
Betty Jackson's white satin zoot suit or Jil Sander's skinny rock-chick
trouser suit in deep iridescent nylon have believable modern glamour.
As one of our experts, Vanessa de Lisle, points out, 'women need not be
frightened of modern nylon. It looks and feels sophisticated.'
For a link between catwalk creativity and commercial nous, old masters such
as Yves St Laurent and Valentino repay attention. They take advanced themes
and cleverly detune them into pretty wearability.
One strand of fashion seems destined to remain on the magazine page rather
than the clothes rail. An undercurrent of violence has succeeded the
ugliness which shocked observers last season - Alexander McQueen's
trussed-chicken polythene dresses and tyre-track printed suits, Rifat
Ozbek's fencing jackets with red slashes and jewelled blood drops,
Lagerfeld's restrictive patent corselets, even Galliano's beautiful but
unhealthily pampered girls in gilded cages - all are suspect images to
today's independent woman. They are designed by men.
At least Westwood's women, for all their over-emphasised curves and silly
high-heeled shoes, appear in control of their lives.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The oyster's in the post - Cooking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT

<TEXT>
Today's brightest shopkeepers do not wait for customers to come to the high
street - they go out and knock at their doors. They have discovered that
sending catalogues and offering a mail order home delivery service can be a
most effective way of increasing business.
Kitchenware merchant David Mellor is one of the latest recruits to this way
of thinking. He has always been happy to send items to customers by post,
but this month sees the launch of his first mail order catalogue for cooks.
Very enticing it is, too.
Others keeping up with the times include Franco and Alberto Camisa. Having
sold specialist foods in Soho, central London, since 1929, they now aim to
sell nationwide via Camisa Direct. Their first catalogue sports some obvious
gift items and some very un-Italian oddities, but it also includes goodies
worth putting in the larder for winter comfort.
There are, for instance, whole San Felino salami and little nibbly
cacciatori salami; stuffed pigs' trotters; capers packed in salt; baskets of
dried porcini; arborio, carnaroli and vialone nano rice; soft amaretti from
Alba; and dried figs from Calabria, stuffed with walnuts and dipped in
chocolate.
For those without a fishmonger in miles - a problem that seems to afflict
vast tracts of Britain these days - Carew Oysters of Pembrokeshire, Wales,
is one of several companies now farming and dispatching the Pacific variety
to private customers and restaurants all over the country.
So far as I know, however, Carew is alone in offering a 'deliver and open
service' where, if you plan a large party and want to splash out, a
professional will bring the shellfish and open them personally.
Many people hate the thought of eating beef from cattle stuffed full of
growth hormones or other indiscriminate medication. But farmers growing
cattle the slow, traditional way on grass and hay only are on the increase.
Newest to me is Richard Vines, of Wild Beef. He raises his animals - mainly
Welsh Black and South Devon, occasionally Aberdeen Angus, Hereford and
Galloway - on Devon moorland and has them slaughtered locally by appointment
for minimum stress. They are hung properly and well-butchered.
Since Wild Beef is essentially a one-man operation, Vines' service can be
more personal than most. Sometimes, he will deliver the meat direct to the
individual customer, depending on whether this works in with his timetable
for restaurant deliveries in the same area. Otherwise, it arrives by
overnight courier.
Wild Beef sells not only prime cuts and mince but also skirt, shin, oxtail,
tongue, kidneys, liver and heart - items offered only rarely by outlets of
this sort.
Those with a sense of adventure will relish news of the Cool Chile Company.
Owner Dodie Miller is dedicated to promoting chillies as more than just
volcanic spices - and she is quietly persuasive.
Mexico State University recognises more than 1,000 varieties and Miller
sells a splendid selection, each variety dried and labelled with a heat
scale warning. They are accompanied by enthusiastic notes about uses and
suggested recipe ideas.
Under her tuition, I tried a few choice samples, ranging from fruity mild to
positively breathtaking. But even those cooks afraid to experiment with
chillies will delight in the colours and shapes of some of them.
If you fancy becoming a food producer - albeit just for your own needs  -
you might like to consider buying a do-it-yourself shitake mushroom grower's
kit imported from Finland by ESC.
This consists of a small, spore-impregnated log packed in its own little
Perspex greenhouse environment. Expected yield is a kilo of shitake
mushrooms spread over four crops. No green fingers are needed.
J. Sainsbury, meanwhile, has just started to sell fresh wild girolles and
grey chanterelles. Ceps (porcini), pieds de mouton and trompettes des morts
will follow shortly, and morels will be introduced in the spring.
The bad news is that - initially, at least - just seven stores in London
(Camden, Chiswick, Cromwell Road, Dulwich, Fulham, Ladbroke Grove and
Hampton St Claires) and one in Southampton (Hedge End) are to stock them.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Chips with everything - New technology is
transforming the traditional kitchen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scene 1: A London restaurant. The customer gives his order to the waitress
who enters it on a hand-held computer. Thirty seconds later the customer
changes his mind but the waitress replies 'I'm sorry, sir, the order is
already in the kitchen.'
Scene 2: Late at night in the chef's office. Having placed all his orders
for tomorrow's deliveries by fax, the chef sits down to finalise plans for a
special gastronomic dinner. He plugs into CompuServe and seeks advice on
recipes from fellow chefs around the world.
Scene 3: takes place wherever food and wine lovers have a computer and
electronic mail. Looking for the most romantic restaurant in St Louis? Want
to trade some Chateau Margaux? Forgotten the name of that wonderful
Australian Pinot Noir you drank recently and need to find a retailer? The
world of food and wine, always international, has gone electronic.
Until the late 1980s most restaurants could not justify such investment.
Computers were introduced slowly and proved themselves by legibly
transmitting recipes around the kitchen. Then came fax machines to make
ordering from suppliers easier (it is always worth taking a restaurant's fax
number to confirm that important lunch).
But the need to cut labour costs, maximise efficiency, monitor stock
controls and improve accounting information has changed all that. Now even
the Ritz's dining room, possibly London's most elegant, boasts an electronic
point-of-sale terminal, albeit neatly encased in marble.
One restaurant made possible by today's technology is Wagamama, WC1 (tel:
071-580 9365). This basement restaurant serves the most interesting
inexpensive Japanese food in town and takes no bookings. It seats 104 but
feeds 1,200 customers a day.
It manages to do so because when it opened in 1992 it paid Pounds 25,000 for
a Remanco ordering system (today's far more advanced version costs Pounds
15,000). These begin with the electronic order pad (they cost Pounds 990
each) which can be programmed with everything a restaurant can offer - size
of steak, how it should be cooked, even whether the customer qualifies for
an incentive scheme such as a happy hour.
When the order is complete, the waitress presses the 'send' button and the
order is transmitted by radio signals to a computer which stores all the
information, backs it up and sends the separate elements to the various
sections of the kitchen. Seconds later the order is printed out. At Wagamama
small strips of paper spew out at the bar, noodle station, wok station and
the station that prepares the side orders. The chefs pick these up and get
to work.
The advantage is not just speed of service but accuracy. Fewer specialist
order takers have to be trained and there is a much lower risk of customers
being served with a dish they did not order or being charged for something
they never received.
The system can fail. Twice in the past hectic 30 months Wagamama's system
has gone down and the restaurant has had to resort to pen and paper. It is
linked by modem to Remanco's headquarters so that a failure can be tracked
down and corrected remotely. More fundamental are human oversights. One
kitchen thought lunch was quiet when at 1.15pm it was still waiting for its
first order. The printer had run out of paper.
This type of electronic ordering generates huge amounts of management
information: how much money each seat generates, how many customers each
waiter serves, a breakdown of all the dishes sold and whether new dishes on
the menu sell or not.
And it is flexible. At Wagamama the philosophy is to deliver as quickly as
possible and keep turning the tables. At other restaurants which want their
staff to try and maximise a customer's spend, known in the trade as
'upselling', other ploys are introduced. When the waiter asks the console
for the bill it responds 'Have you offered cigars and liqueurs?' At Rules,
WC2, (071-836 5314) the chef can communicate to all the waiting staff just
how many grouse, partridge or pheasant, are left and save the embarrassment
of having to ask the customer for a reorder.
One wonderful piece of technology I saw in action in the US over the summer
was shown for the first time in the UK at this week's Restaurant Show. It is
the Silent Paging System. When you arrive at a restaurant and find either
that there is no table or your table is not ready, the receptionist hands
you a small disc which you put in your pocket. When your table is clear the
waiter sends a radio signal to the receptionist and she in turn presses a
button which starts the disc vibrating in your pocket. Having enjoyed a
short stroll, a drink in the bar or done some shopping, you walk back to
find your table ready and waiting.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Food &amp; Drink: A great vintage rained off - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
During the summer in the Bordeaux region conditions were perfect if not for
yet another 'Vintage of the Century' at least for the production of one of
the vintages of the decade.
The vine flowering at the end of May was early and swift, although the
outcome was on the small side. But it was quality not quantity that was
urgently looked for.
June was cool, but July with a little rain, and August were relentlessly
hot, especially in the first 10 days of August. The last three weeks enjoyed
heatwave temperatures of 28-29`C (82-84`F) with occasional storms: perfect
for the month that traditionally 'makes the flavour'.
The veraison (when the grapes change colour) in the first 10 days was
unusually early. The bunches were smaller than last year, but the grapes
were bigger.
Haut-Brion picked its very special white grapes on August 31 and started its
reds on September 10 - one day after the Ban de Vendange that officially
permits the red wine picking to begin. A first-growth director said he was
going to make 'a superb 1994'.
Everything was fine until September 7 when some not very significant rain
fell, but fate struck on September 12, and it rained for the next four days,
washing away the prospects of a great vintage.
The dates for picking varied according to local conditions. This is the
largest fine-wine area in the world. It may be raining in Pauillac but sunny
in Pomerol. The general starting date this year was September 19, and the
finishing date September 29.
Among the leaders Chateaux Margaux picked from September 14-28, with
Cheval-Blanc in St Emilion from September 16-30, Vieux-Chateau Certan in
Pomerol from September 12-24, Pichon-Lalande in Pauillac from September
17-28 but had to speed up as the ripe grapes were falling off the vines
while Mouton-Rothschild began on September 19, stopped owing to rain on
September 22, and re-started on the 28th with 800 pickers to finish on
October 1.
So what are the likely results? The dry white Graves picked before the heavy
rains in the first week of the month made excellent wines, but very small in
quantity. The Sauternes and Barsacs that waited until the end of the month,
and completed picking in the first 10 days of October made successful wines,
but those that did not delay suffered badly.
For the reds, only a provisional assessment is possible before the vats are
emptied after the fermentation. However the general view is that the 1994s
are better than the 1993s, whose reputation has been steadily rising, and
whose prices probably will.
Colours are deeper, the grapes are riper and the alcoholic degrees higher. I
sampled a variety of wines, mostly Merlot, that had finished their
fermentation and was impressed by their colour and sweetness. It is a Merlot
year because picking is usually earlier on the right bank of St Emilion and
in Pomerol. Professor Ribereau-Gayon, head of the Oenological Institute of
Bordeaux University has been quoted as saying that the Merlots are
'homogenous'. The laggards are usually the Cabernet Sauvignons, but owing to
the exceptional summer a good many were ripe at the same time as the
Merlots. The vintage has been compared with '88 but with softer tannins.
What about likely prices? If it had been the predicted great vintage they
would have rocketed for the internationally known 'names'. Moreover with
fine wines short on the Bordeaux market the chateaux have been very
successfully selling their stocks held up by several recession years.
Haut-Brion '89, considered the finest first growth of the vintage, currently
sells on the Bourse for FFr600 (Pounds 72) (a bottle, duty paid, has a
delivered price of about Pounds 110 in the UK). Latour Margaux and Montrose
'90 are unobtainable there. The leading seconds are around FFr150. The 1993
firsts opened at FFr155 a bottle, the next rank at FFr60-70, and a general
view is that the 1994s will start at 10 per cent higher, but not more if
they expect to sell a substantial portion of their crop. The crop is smaller
than last year.
Meanwhile, what should one look to buy in the near future? The '93s will be
in bottle next spring. They have good colour and when carefully selected
originally, have a good deal of body and character: much more than the '92s.
Nevertheless in two or three years these relatively inexpensive wines from
reliable sources may make agreeable introductory or 'luncheon clarets' for
moderate meals.
I was agreeably surprised with those left-bank '91 wines which had survived
that year's terrible April frosts. They have engaging bouquets and fruity
bodies; not expensive but must be carefully chosen and bought only from
merchants who specialise in fine claret.

If your souffle will not rise, someone in cyberspace can help.
The Internet, the global computer network, lets you link up with people of
the same interests, via mailing lists or news groups. You send a message to
sign up and receive the news and opinions of other members of the group.
'Foodwine' is one of the two main lists for gourmets. 'The purpose is for
serious, but not pedantic, discussion of food, beverages and related
concerns,' say Elliott Parker and Musa Knickerbocker who run the list from
Central Michigan University. 'Consider the list as a discussion around a
very large table among people who like to discuss food: the talk may become
passionate and even off-topic sometimes, but always returns to the topic.'
When I dropped in, a discussion of Zinfandel wines was in progress.
Another list is the 'eat-l', where everyone airs their views on how this or
that dish should be cooked. Rachel Karan in Alaska was having problems with
her chicken soup which was too salty. Suggestions poured in: add canned
broth, giblets and so on. Lars Larsen from Sonderberg, Denmark offered 2,000
words on chutney recipes and then 7,000 on cranberry dishes.
In cyberspace you never really know whether the advice is from an expert or
a well-meaning neophyte. So on 'rec. food. restaurants' a posting of 'I'm
off to Greedy Gulch next week. Where can I get some decent food?' will
elicit replies from opinionated locals with whom you cannot remonstrate if
their recommendation turns out to be a greasy spoon.
The list tends to be US-dominated. Asked to recommend somewhere in Soho,
London, Glen Poorman from Michigan suggested Wong Kei, a Chinese restaurant
better known for shovelling customers in and out quickly than for its chow
mein. 'Packed house, incredibly rude waiters and low prices,' enthused Glen,
'but awesome food]'

FT  29 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: Be charitable and let the postman be your

<TEXT>
When the piles of Christmas catalogues arriving on my desk and doormat
reaches mountainous proportions then I give in . . . Christmas is coming and
nothing short of Armageddon will stop it. So for those who believe in
planning Christmas rather as Rommel might have approached the desert
campaign, it is once again time to get out the catalogues, to think of one's
nearest and dearest, to start the lists.
The catalogues whose proceeds go to support charities are as good a place as
any to start - they may be short on expensive knick-knackery and truly
sumptuous luxury but they nevertheless offer a multitude of cheerful
presents that do not cost a fortune. From the most remote relation who needs
just a token acknowledgement that the season of goodwill has arrived to the
very best-
loved there ought to be something in them for almost everybody. If nothing
else,
all of them offer the statutory selection of Christmas cards and
holly-bedecked
paper.
Here then is a run-down of some of the catalogues on offer.
*****
Oxfam, Oxfam Trading, PO Box 72, Bicester, Oxon 0X6 7LT. Tel: 0869-245011.
Perhaps the grandaddy of them all - the company that first promoted the
notion of fair trade, of helping poorer countries by buying their products
rather than handing over money. From rug-makers in Mexico to printers in
Ahmedabad and batik artists in Indonesia, buying their wares will keep them
in work. The slant is, of course, ethnic but that is the catalogue's charm.
Brightly coloured waistcoats from Guatemala, cotton rugs from India,
jewellery from Chile . . . most of the products are brightly-coloured,
cheerful if short on sophistication. Prices are excellent - a pretty
mirror-worked wall-tidy for Pounds 7.95, soapstone solitaire set from Kenya
for Pounds 9.95 and some enchanting Loro Blonyo figures from Indonesia
(usually given at weddings) for Pounds 59.90.
*****
WWF, PO Box 49, Burton-on-Trent. Tel: 0283-506105.
Nice fat catalogue with the profits going to what Robin Pellew, its
director, describes as the 'business of saving wildlife'. Not surprisingly,
many of the products have an animal theme - needlework cushion covers
featuring leopards (Pounds 39.99), wooden tortoise book-ends (Pounds 19.99),
plenty of animal Christmas cards, a beautiful crystal bowl with a school of
dolphins sand-blasted round the edge (Pounds 79.99) and a tough coir doormat
featuring a panda (Pounds 14.99). Also, for more everyday use, some
beautifully plain, simple and fine clothing - a creamy cotton and linen
sweater (Pounds 51.99) and creamy cotton T-shirts and night-shirts.
*****
Help the Aged, PO Box 28, London N18 3HG. Tel: 081-803 6861.
Hot water bottle covers, floral-bedecked bags to hold knitting, door guard
alarms, lightweight gardening shears, foot-relaxers, folding walking sticks
and an alarmingly large 'pill organiser' are the kind of presents that Help
the Aged feels might enliven the scene around the Christmas tree. The
emphasis is on the useful rather than the charming or the beguiling.
Nevertheless, there can hardly be anybody who could not use at least one of
their handy gadgets. I rather fancy the moonlight lamp myself (Pounds 12.99,
it runs off batteries and is just what one needs for reading when camping in
the bush).
*****
British Red Cross, Britcross Ltd, PO Box 28, Burton-on-Trent, Staffs. DE14
3LQ. Tel: 0283-506767.
From the most deliciously kitsch brightly-coloured tulip doorstop (Pounds
9.99) to a Fleur-de-Lys throwover (excellent value at Pounds 24.99), wooden
bookends embellished with carved apples (Pounds 17.95) and warm furry-lined
suede slippers (Pounds 12.99), this is a small catalogue to help the charity
that 'cares for people in crisis . . . whether . . . in Bosnia or Bolton,
Somalia or Sheffield'. Not the biggest or the best but enough to choose
from.
*****
The National Trust for Scotland, 5 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh EH2 4DU. Tel:
031-243 9399.
Some unusual presents here - a ready-to-sew hat kit, for instance, at Pounds
15.95, and a sturdy wooden Victoria garden tray (Pounds 32.25). Then there
is a charming travelling games compendium (backgammon, chess, checkers, two
packs of cards, dominoes and dice in a little black box for Pounds 22.95),
some silver-plated spoons for butter (with a cow on top), pate (topped by a
fish), mustard (with a mustard pot) and honey (with a bee) all at Pounds
8.50 each and some useful tartan picnic rugs (Pounds 49.50).
*****
NSPCC Trading Company, PO Box 39, Burton on Trent, Staffs. DE14 3LQ. Tel:
0800-444280.
As is only right and proper for a charity devoted to the welfare of
children, this one has more for the small set than most - fun watches
(water-resistant with funnyman figures, Pounds 14.99), a beginner's
microscope (Pounds 12.99), friendly soldiers laundry bag (Pounds 6.99),
wooden puzzles and construction sets. There is quite a lot of choice, too,
for the grown-ups - an enchanting Peruvian Dancer's hairslide (Pounds 5.99),
virginal white cotton nightdress with pintucks and white embroidery (Pounds
27.95), cassette carriers (a staple of charity Christmas card catalogues),
candlesticks (plain blue glass at Pounds 5.99 each or verdigris-finished
ones at Pounds 23.99).
*****
Shelter, 88 Old Street, London EC1V 9HU. Tel: 0983-821303.
Not so much a brochure, more a pamphlet with not a lot of choice but some
nice things nevertheless - cone-shaped candles and beeswax ones (a very 'in'
present), wooden puzzles for small children (housing jigsaw, Pounds 6.75,
and elephant jigsaw, Pounds 6.75), good notebooks and stationery.

WaterAid Trading, PO Box 10,Gateshead NE8 1LL. tel: 091-487 0399.
Another charity that goes in for just a folded pamphlet and not a full-scale
catalogue but it has some nice things on offer - sturdy sisal carriers
(Pounds 19.95), high-quality ground coffee from Cafedirect, the company that
insists on paying fair prices for the beans, silver ear-rings from Thailand
(Pounds 3.25) and notebooks made from paper made from jute fibres (think of

Traidcraft has a whole series of catalogues - Interiors; Alternatives
(primarily fashion); Paper and Cards; Foods, Teas, Coffees and Tissues and
Christmas Cards and Gifts. All are based on the idea of 'combining the
skills of 'third world' producers with a concern that these craftspeople get
a fair deal from international trading'. They are mostly all-year-round
catalogues but you could find something for everybody by trawling through
all these catalogues. Here we have sketched some sweet brown velvet slippers
embroidered with gold stars at just Pounds 29.95 a pair as well as a
naturally dyed sisal carry-all (Pounds 19.95) but there is lots, lots more.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Property: Cool and controlled - that's how to create a best
cellar - Demand from oenophiles remains solid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROSALIND RUSSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As an object of desire it is temperamental, can suffer from alarmingly
expensive ailments, and is rarely a thing of beauty. But wine-lovers are a
patient breed and, to them, a cellar is to be prized, cajoled and indulged -
especially as it might be protecting a considerable investment.
Since three men were jailed earlier this year for the systematic theft of
Pounds 2m worth of fine wines held in bond, a private - and secure - cellar
has become even more attractive. BBC Food and Drink television host Oz
Clarke and the Marquess of Bristol were among the victims, but the ripple of
shock must have rattled claret glasses across the land.
'A lot of people ask: 'Has the house got a cellar? Because we have a lot of
nice wine.'' says Colin Swait, of estate agent Hamptons. 'Most people seem
to keep their wine under the stairs these days. But there are still those
who buy wine to put down, so the cellar is an advantage.'
Max Robertson would not live in a house without one. The voice of radio
tennis until he retired nine years ago, Robertson lives in the Old Manor, a
Grade II-listed Georgian house owned by Patricia Savill in Aldbourne,
Wiltshire - which is now on the market through Savills, the agent, which is
seeking offers of more than Pounds 1m.
Almost immediately after they moved in 2 1/2 years ago, a programme of
restoration was put in hand. Included was an electronic cooling system
installed in the 20ft by 8ft cellar to maintain a constant temperature for
his wine collection. An emergency generator provides back-up in the event of
a power failure.
He points out: 'If you have nice wines - and I'm not saying mine are the
greatest - it is worth keeping them well.' Indeed, he says a suitable cellar
was a prime consideration in moving to Aldbourne - although his previous
homes in the Channel Islands and Wandsworth, south-west London, both had
temperature-controlled cellars.
'My present cellar can hold between 3,000 and 4,000 bottles,' adds
Robertson. 'I don't say it does have that many, though - a lot has been
drunk.'
Apart from the obvious charm of the six-bedroomed manor, with a conservatory
running the full length of the back of the house, the cellar has provoked
considerable interest. 'I have to say that all the people who have come to
view the house have thought it is fantastic,' says Patricia Savill. 'And it
wasn't expensive to put in - just over Pounds 5,000.' The wine racks are not
included in the sale but a buyer will get an artist's studio, garden
cottage, garaging for four cars and a walled rose garden.
Among other country houses with wine cellars now on the market is Berden
Hall, which is being sold through Bidwells for Pounds 975,000. Six miles
from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, it is grade II*-listed with eight
bedrooms, staff cottage and flat, and just over 15 acres.
Apart from its wine cellar, it has an indoor pool, billiards room, flood-lit
tennis court, squash court and stable yard. The wine cellar is next to a
secondary cellar housing the boilers.
'The trouble with a lot of cellars is that people found it convenient to put
their oil-fired boilers in there when central heating was installed,' says
Swait. 'It can ruin the cellars for wine. But temperature-controlled cellars
are an investment.'
When the Swaits bought their own house in Surrey, it had brick barrel vaults
full of empty Dom Perignon bottles. They turned their cellar into a kitchen.
'Some people fill them in with rubble to cure a damp problem,' he says. 'To
take on a cellar can be an expensive business if you have to sterilise the
lot to deal with dry rot and then seal it.
'A tennis court is still a bigger attraction than a wine cellar, especially
to people with daughters. A tennis court keeps them at home and stops them
wandering.'
Ian Homersham, joint chairman of John D. Wood, adds: 'Your better London
house would normally have had a cellar with bins in the basement. A lot have
been destroyed because people opened up the basements and now use them.'
Where water tables preclude an underground wine cellar, home owners often
dedicate a ground floor room as a wine store.
One family who bought a house in East Anglia planned to return such a room
to everyday use as a dining room. When they picked up the keys and arrived
at their new home, they found the doorbell and the knocker had been removed.
Once inside, they realised everything else had been stripped, too. But there
was a happy ending.
As Andrew Hay, of Knight Frank and Rutley, tells it: 'When the family began
to refurbish, they discovered the bins at ceiling height in the wine store
had not been emptied. They were full of vintage claret and port. The family
sold it for a fortune - enough to pay for the work.'

FT  29 OCT 94 / Motoring: A looker with loads of style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All cars - well, almost all cars - are so good nowadays that it is perfectly
sensible to choose them on their looks, size and price. There is no point
worrying too much over the purely technical features: most drivers neither
understand nor want to know about them.
That being so, I predict a bright future for the Vauxhall Tigra coupe (an
Opel on mainland Europe). This little 2+2 is so pretty that it cannot fail
to turn heads.
The Tigra is related closely to the Corsa hatchback and was seen first as a
styling concept at last year's London Motor Show. The public responded so
enthusiastically that, months (rather than years) later, it was rolling off
the assembly line.
The Tigra goes on sale in the UK in mid-November priced at Pounds 10,995 for
the 1.4-litre and Pounds 12,995 for the better-equipped 1.6. But there is
little to tell them apart; even the engine size is not indicated, to please
the insurance companies and keep premiums down.
The main external difference is that only the 1.6 has a standard sun-roof,
larger-diameter alloy wheels with wider tyres, and body coloured bumpers.
For the extra Pounds 2,000, buyers also get anti-lock brakes, twin air-bags
(rather than just one for the driver), electrically-adjusted door mirrors,
fog lamps, and a leather-covered steering wheel. Power steering is standard
on both models.
Already, the Tigra has proved a smash hit with women, and Vauxhall expects a
majority of buyers to be female (as they are for the Tigra's only
competitor, the Honda Civic coupe, which costs Pounds 10,900 with manual
gears and Pounds 11,670 as an automatic). But when my wife and I stopped our
Tigra in a dusty square near Barcelona a few weeks ago it was the men who
gathered round. They admired its lines, asked how fast it went, and preened
with pride when I told them it was made in Spain.
So I disagree with those who take one look at the Tigra and half-dismiss it
as a 'woman's car'. I see it as having a similar appeal to the old British
Motor Corporation's frog-eyed Sprite, although it is light years ahead of
that dreadfully crude and uncomfortable two-seater of a generation ago.
Both Tigra models are entertaining to drive. Their engines combine ample
pulling power at low speeds with a willingness to spin quickly, and the
five-speed gearbox has a sweet shift. There is no automatic option yet but
that is on the way.
Which to buy? I would go for the 1.4. It rides better than the
squatter-tyred 1.6; yet, on winding hill roads, it handled just as nimbly
and securely. Outputs of the 1.4 and 1.6 engines are not all that far apart
(90 compared with 106 horsepower), performance differences are fairly
trivial, and either model should reward a sensible driver with at least
40mpg (7.06 l/100km).
The small boot's capacity is doubled by folding the back seats (which
Vauxhall admits are really for under-12s) and head room is restricted.
Parents of young children may have trouble strapping them into the back of a
Tigra. (I find fixing our grandchildren's safety seats difficult enough,
even into good-sized, four-door cars.)
I cannot see many Tigras being bought as sole transport for households with
small children. But it must appeal strongly to men and women in their 20s -
and, I suspect, to empty-nesters more than twice their age. Vauxhall's
forecast of 4,000 British sales this year could be over-modest.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Motoring: Please go easy on diesel, Mr Chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Clarke, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, warned a year ago
that excise duty on motor fuel would go up by at least 5 per cent in his
next Budget - due at the end of November, writes Stuart Marshall. In plain
English, that could means up to 18 pence a gallon - or 4p a litre.
That figure could, however, be a great deal higher - perhaps almost double.
It depends how strongly the government is convinced that the best way to
curb atmospheric pollution is to reduce vehicle mileages, and that the best
way to achieve this is to put up fuel prices.
But would it work? Italy has some of the most expensive petrol in Europe;
but if high pump prices have persuaded Italian motorists to leave their cars
at home, or moderate their driving habits, it hardly shows.
The most obvious causes of exhaust pollution in big towns are lorries, buses
and taxis powered by old - and often ill-maintained - diesel engines.
Because most diesel cars in use are fairly new, their individual
contribution to the pollution total is minute.
This is acknowledged widely by industry experts. But modern diesel cars get
tarred with the same brush as the stinking old smokers.
In general, politicians seem remarkably ignorant about diesel cars. ('I know
taxis have diesel engines but are there really diesel cars?' one junior
minister said to me, straight-faced and quite serious, only a few years
ago).
Will the diesel car get a square deal this time? I doubt it. In the past
year, there has been too much ill-informed comment on diesel vehicle
emissions.
All one can really hope is that things stay as they are and that the
chancellor does not take fiscal steps to slow down the growth in diesel car
sales. But even with the fuel taxed at the same level as unleaded petrol, we
diesel car-users know we can drive at least 20 per cent further on every
litre.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Outdoors: One ski in the grave - but no parrots / FT Ski
Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip. They are in New Zealand.
I have joined New Zealand's One Ski In The Grave Club. Although one is
supposed to be 55, when I applied for membership for Nigel, my skiing chum
in Hampstead, London, they made on exception for me. At 50, I am old enough
to qualify as a veteran.
However after an exhilarating day's helicopter skiing in the Harris
Mountains (Lucy's first full day of heli-skiing) I feel it may be some time
before both skis are entombed.
We thrived in excellent corn snow on Roller Coaster and Gold Mine Ridge and
found good powder on Twin Falls.
We also landed on the spectacular Tasman Glacier in a Pilatus ski-plane.
While the skiing was undemanding, the scenery - not dissimilar to the Vallee
Blanche in Chamonix was superb. Bob Monro, our guide, even led us through
tunnels in the huge ice-falls, and on one occasion we took off our skis and
climbed into a series of tomb-like ice-caves in a huge crevasse.
Meanwhile we have become the latest victims of New Zealand's unique Alpine
Parrot, the Kea. This comical bird - which waddles and hops its way around
every ski area in South Island - cannot resist sinking its sharp beak into
anything malleable. Ski gloves, cardboard cups, picnic leftovers, or - in
our case, rubber clips on our ski-rack - the Kea will go for it.
Sometimes there is no escape. The official archives of Mount Robert recall
that even in the primitive alpine lavatories, 'with a large gap above the
door, the occupant would invariably be subjected to 'Charlie' Kea's beady
eyes as it hung upside down from the roof. Should the door be accidentally
left open, it would be seen flying off trailing a huge streamer of toilet
paper.'
At Porter Heights, one of these clownish birds got inside a lift operator's
rucksack and ate his sandwiches while he was standing, oblivious, a few feet
away. More seriously, Keas frequently gnaw their way through rubber seals on
car windscreens and rip off the insulation around electrical components on
ski lifts.
Many ski resort staff would cheerfully shoot them, but this would result in
a hefty fine. Recently a European tourist was heavily fined for trying to
smuggle Keas out of the country in tubes stuffed into his trousers. They are
said to be worth Pounds 50,000 to collectors.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Outdoors: The day we found El Dourado - Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To be able, on a marrow-chilling February day, to tell your chums 'I'm
fishing in Brazil next week' is a pleasure of rare deliciousness. To be
ignobly honest, the pleasure is enhanced significantly by the expressions of
envy writ large on their faces.
So there I was, in a rather natty straw hat and daft shorts, white legs and
arms and neck shiny with sun cream. I was feeling pretty pleased with myself
as I poured cold beer down my throat and surveyed the surging half-mile
breadth of the Parana river, down near the Paraguayan border.
I had a companion on this adventure. In his field, he has something of a
reputation as a fierce and combative interrogator and mangler of public
figures. But I found him a jovial soul and have decided to forgive him for
exposing me to ridicule in his account of our expedition. For one thing, it
would be beneath my dignity; for another, he has a nice bit of trout fishing
in Gloucestershire.
Before we started I did my best to demolish notions of my angling
proficiency. But neither Edward, our host on the Parana, nor Jorge, our
dark-skinned, gleaming-toothed boatman, would take any notice. And my
companion - who, for the sake of convenience, I shall call 'P' - persisted
in harping on about it.
The only way to rid myself of the slur was to display thorough and constant
uselessness - which I did.
We had come in pursuit of the great fish of the Parana - the dourado. I knew
something about it, having read old books by Englishmen who had paid visits
70 years and more ago to do battle with it. They called it the Golden
Salmon, although it does not look like a salmon at all. It is, however, a
most magnificent fish: its fins, tummy and head deep gold; its broad flanks
spotted with black; its wide, predator's mouth bristling with teeth.
Those Englishmen of olden days went after it with spinners, and many were
the epic encounters they had in the surging currents of the colossal Parana.
I had thought, vaguely, that we would spin, too - or even fish with fly -
and had brought with me rods and reels lent by Hardy Brothers which would, I
hoped, suffice. But the river was 15ft above normal and mud-brown. Perforce,
we had to follow local practice. This involved impaling a slippery, eel-like
creature called a morenita on the hook, with a large weight above. This was
then hurled upstream from the boat and zoomed downstream with the current.
The theory (sound when practised efficiently) is that the bait bounces along
over the rocks until seized by a rapacious dourado.
Ah, the rocks. What a multitude of those we hooked and failed to land. 'P'
would stand at one end of the boat, red-faced under his green baseball cap.
I would be at the other, smirking at his discomfort, then cursing as I
became hooked up. Between us were Jorge and Edward, grinning at our antics.
Our performance was, on the whole, pathetic. But we did catch some fish. 'P'
caught a piranha, which was appropriate, and some small dourado. I hooked
one decent one, which took the bait with such violence that my multiplier
reel over-ran and jammed. The fish got off and everyone, apart from me,
laughed.
Edward, taking time off from schadenfreude, caught a tremendous 28-pounder
which, roasted whole, made a memorable feast. It was maddening, but it was
also the greatest fun. The beer, the heat, the river, and its forest, the
comforts and hospitality afforded us, the companionship - all were ample
consolation for the failures. But, always, the thought nagged at me: we
should not be fishing this way, we should be spinning.
By the last day, the river had dropped and cleared. We trailed our baits
around without joy, then headed for base. As we did so, Jorge spotted
dourado slashing at the surface near the shore. I rigged up a spinning rod
while he edged in towards them. Using a large copper spoon, I hooked four -
and lost them all. The last, announcing itself in a great golden boil, bent
my Hardy rod like a horse-shoe and broke a 20-pound line like cotton.
It was the most exciting half-hour of my fishing career, a glimpse, both
tantalising and agonising, of what might have been. But if I try again, I
shall know what to do. I shall go in November or December when the water
should be right.
I shall take a rod capable of quelling a shark, with line to match, and
copper spoons with single, extra-strength, extra-sharp hooks.
I shall, politely but firmly, wave away Jorge and his horrible, slimy
morenitas. I shall, most assuredly, catch the fish of a lifetime. And I
shall be very modest about it.
Tom Fort's trip was arranged by Dourado Sports Fishing, 72 Glenthorne Rd,
London W6 0LR, tel: 081-583 1988, fax 081-503 2230, with the help of the
Brazilian airline Varig.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Outdoors: No excuse for a dull autumn - Gardening
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
We have had the most marvellous days for autumn colour: the field maples
have been the most brilliant yellow in every farm hedgerow in which these
easy trees are planted. I have been trying to see them in context with an
outsider's eye, with this result.
For six months of the year, marooned wives, harassed weekenders, and
financiers who really do want to create something more than a paper muddle,
engage in a constant battle to weed their flower beds, swap round their
plants and colour-plan their borders. Their aim is to grow as many flowers
as possible, arranged to look like heaven on a golden evening.
They start to ease off in October, whereupon trees, shrubs and many border
plants turn to colours of a brilliance which flowers cannot equal.
Gardeners, though, are still fussing about the last few blooms on their
roses, considering that autumn's other colours are for park-owners and
farmers - but not for them.
There are excuses, of course. 'How can we give up space for something which
lasts for just a fortnight? The garden is too small. Autumn is too muddy. We
have enough leaves to rake up already. The best place to see colour is in
somebody else's arboretum. When we are more organised, we really must try to
go to Westonbirt. Once you have seen the fall in Vermont, you do not want to
bother with Sussex on a wet afternoon . . .'
I disagree. Once again, the agapanthi have turned a brilliant yellow while
the white rose blanc double has started its third season, turning yellow to
match them. Anyone with acid soil, good trees or a euonymus has added an
extra fortnight to a season which flower gardens cut short.
Admittedly, you need the right euonymus. In a smallish garden, the answer is
E. altus compactus, the winged form with branches that will have spread only
about 3ft high and wide after several years. Two or three of them stand well
against the front of a shrubbery, woodland or lightly-shaded hedge.
They turn to the most amazing shade of scarlet, equalling anything in
flower, and grow steadily almost anywhere. They are cheaper and less
susceptible to drought or lime than the small Japanese maples which
gardeners seem to prefer. Red Cascade is a bigger alternative; it is twice
as large and not so bright but set with masses of red fruit.
On acid soil, there is no excuse for a dull autumn among the declining
azaleas. A few bushes of the easy enkianthus go a long way unless you like
bell-shaped flowers in a dullish white during high summer. This weekend,
they are something else: a flaming mass of red which saves their reputation
in a sudden finale.
Again, they are not large plants. I like to see them behind the smaller
azaleas with a bush or two of the sensational disanthus behind them, perhaps
to one side. Although its flowers are negligible, this larger shrub has
leaves shaped like hearts which go to the colour of deep claret and crimson
in slight shade wherever an acid soil is not too dry.
Higher up, on any soil, it has to be parrotia, a Persian tree which is
surprisingly lime-tolerant but likes to spread widely. It looks superb in
rough grass if two plants are spaced out in isolation: you can train the
central stem into a tall leader by supporting it on a tree stake, persuading
it to make height which parrotias otherwise avoid for spread. Behind it, at
a distance, you can put the upright ginkgo biloba as a narrow, vertical
contrast. I wish our town councils had planted this urban tree as widely as
in New York or Seoul. Ginkgos turn the most brilliant shade of yellow all
over those curious leaves, which look like a webbed little hand.
People worry that they grow too slowly to be worth planting as a boundary,
but I notice that one of the best sources of unusual autumn trees would
disagree. The Bluebell Nursery of Blackfordby, Swadlincote, Derbyshire,
lists all sorts of varieties and indicates their probable size after five
years. It estimates that a ginkgo would be eight to 12ft high by then.
The supreme advantage of a ginkgo is that, although an extremely old tree,
it thrives in our polluted cities.
In its place, many authorities have preferred the coarse and stiffly-shaped
malus, which is now called Bonfire, or one of the more common types of
flowering prunus. It is always worth considering the autumn colour when
planting a prunus, or flowering cherry, but the prettiest in flower and leaf
are not always the best known.
This weekend, I am being pleasantly surprised by the upright, single white
Umeniko, which has such elegant leaves of a fresh, lively green and such
pretty white rounded blossom in spring. I have never known it turn such a
magnificent shade of red. Its only superior is more famous for the autumn
season: another single white of great distinction called Korean Hill.
Either of these trees would make superb specimens on the boundary or towards
the back of the lawn of a smallish garden.

   A winter cricket tour
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
three months in the Caribbean or four travelling around Australia - sounds
like an agreeable way of spending the English winter. How nice it must be to
bask in the sunshine in T-shirt and shorts, warm waves lapping your ankles,
beside you a cool beer and a copy of the newspaper reporting the doom and
gloom back home. Occasionally you play a little sport.
Reality is not quite as easy for members of the England touring party, apart
from the doom and gloom back home bit. Yes they may have island hopped round
the West Indies from January through to April, then this month embarked on
their 16-week tour of the Great Outback but no they have not been to any
beaches or even caught a whiff of a pina colada.
Well, that is not quite true. When the team eventually left Antigua in
mid-April this year at the end of a hard-fought test series, there was a day
set aside for sun, sea, sand and the rest of it. 'Before that,' said the
fast bowler Angus Fraser 'all we'd seen was hotels, airports and cricket
grounds. A fortnight in Jamaica may sound fantastic but it's not if you are
stuck in run-down crime-ridden Kingston and more or less imprisoned in your
hotel by security guards.'
The 1994-95 Australian tour lasts 116 days, but only six of these (including
Christmas Day), are completely free of matches, travelling or practice.
There are 20 internal transfers across three time zones leaving little
opportunity or energy for exploration. Most will return with no more
knowledge of Australia than when they left.
Your heart is still probably not bleeding for them. But tours are much
harder than they used to be because of the speed of transport and the advent
of one day internationals, which are played to excess in Australia. The
players do not necessarily help themselves. They are notoriously
unadventurous, preferring to lounge around hotel swimming pools in their
England tracksuits hoping to attract the attentions of other, preferably
female guests, rather than venture further afield.
There are exceptions. Derek Pringle and David Gower disappeared off into the
bush with their zoom lenses (during tours of India private jets or
distinguished travel guides materialise miraculously for international
cricketers) and Bruce French, the wicketkeeper, climbed mountains.
In the main though, overseas tours are routine, neatly summed up by the
title of Frances Edmonds' book about the last England tour of Australia
which was called Cricket, XXXX, Cricket. On match days in Australia, the
Sheraton hotel breakfast will be eaten in the room at 7.15am (players
usually double up as much for economy as team spirit) the team bus will
leave at 8.15, though Phil Tufnell usually keeps it waiting. Repetitive warm
ups are scheduled for 9am (England endured 99 of these sessions during the
West Indies tour) and the game starts at 10am, although one day games often
begin an hour earlier. At the 6pm close of play a crate of beers is brought
to the dressing room and rapidly drunk. Then the players head back to the
hotel for a wash and brush-up before dinner. Most are in bed by 10pm.
During a Test the dressing room floor gradually disappears beneath the
clutter of bats, boots, pads, sweaty clothes and other paraphernalia that
spews out of the players' kitbags. Hauling these around continents is an
ordeal. In some countries there is help. Govind has looked after the kit of
teams touring India since 1949. At night he sleeps with it in the dressing
room, resting his head on a pair of pads. 'I haven't lost one bag in 45
years,' he says proudly.
Sometimes the players are hard to keep track of. John Emburey sailed a
windsurf board out to sea in the Caribbean, but could not turn it round and
had to be rescued by lifeguards; Mike Gatting, captain at the time, missed
the warm-ups and arrived 20 minutes after the start of a match at Melbourne
in 1986 claiming his alarm had not gone off, Allan Lamb disappeared into a
Queensland casino 80 miles from the Test ground; and then there was Gower's
infamous impersonation of a first world war pilot.
The leading stars in any side are wont to go it alone, leaving everyone else
in their wake. Younger players stick together, which on this England tour
means almost everyone except Gatting (37) and Gooch (41). If that pair -
Gatting has discovered fitness - keep up their habit of turning up for
practice an hour before everyone else, they will be sick of the sight of
each other by February.
The fringe players have the worst deal, apart from the wives, who are
usually only 'allowed' on tour for a couple of weeks. Once the big games
have begun, the reserves trail from ground to ground with little prospect of
being involved in the action, nothing but a handful of enthusiastic boys to
practice with and little time off in case there are sudden injuries in the
camp. It is hard work, but even so, I would rather be playing for England in
Australia, than watching them on television in the British winter.

FT  29 OCT 94 / Sport: Sparring begins in San Diego - The intrigue
surrounding the Americas Cup regatta / Sailing
</HEADLINE>

There are lots of comparisons going on in San Diego right now. Men versus
women. Wide against narrow. The occasion is the International America's Cup
Class world championship.
Most of the teams that will compete in the Cup itself, beginning in January,
have a boat entered in this 'check-out' regatta, so-called because of the
opportunity to check out the opposition prior to the main event.
Intense interest is focused on the all-women crew sailing the America3 yacht
Kanza. It is the first time at this level of sailing that women have raced
against men in a world-class event. Initial fears that a deficit in body
strength would handicap 'the Cubettes' seem to have been wrong.
'These boats aren't terribly physical. It's about talent and mind-games,'
said Dawn Riley, one of the afterguard and the only woman aboard Kanza with
previous Cup experience.
Olympic gold medals and world championships abound among the other 15 crew.
America3, funded and sailed by energy billionaire and amateur yachtsman Bill
Koch, walked away with the Cup in 1992. Koch admitted to having spent
Dollars 70m on the programme, much of it on high-technology R &amp; D rather
than training and technique. His designers produced yachts that were long,
narrow and heavy when compared to the opposition. They were also much
faster.
Two of the new generation of IACC boats built since then will be racing this
week; oneAustralia and the Japanese entry JPN-30. It will be fascinating to
see the extent to which they have followed the hull design trend started by
Koch's technical gurus but far from universally believed in by the
opposition.
Koch's presence is largely a consequence of a dispute with IRS officials.
His 1992 campaign was via a not-for-profit foundation which gives
considerable tax benefits to the donor, in this case Koch. The IRS told Koch
that his tax-breaks depended on continued involvement in the Cup. Putting
women on the boat began as a snook-cocking exercise aimed at the taxman but
has unintentionally proved an inspired move in terms of sponsorship and
media coverage.
Papers such as USA Today, hardly known for its yachting, have been giving a
great deal of coverage, consumer companies which make products for women
have been keen to provide support, and the television networks cannot get
enough onboard footage of the Cubettes.
Among the more traditional participants, none has attracted more attention
than the Australian challenger John Bertrand, head of oneAustralia.
Bertrand, skippering the wing-keeled Australia II, took the Cup away from
America in 1983. It was the first victory by a challenger in 132 years, the
longest home-run in international sport. Since then Bertrand has done little
sailing, concentrating instead on a business career.
It may be that his business contacts helped him to put together a complete
Dollars 30m sponsorship package, largely supported by Phillip Morris, while
other challengers struggled in the customary financial mire. Bertrand has
his first new boat racing this week, with a second being built. That is
proving his undoing. OneAustralia has a design co-operation programme with
the rival Australian campaign funded by Sydney property entrepreneur Syd
Fischer. All four boats will be drawn by the same 'think-tank' in which each
group has shares and board members.
Every other Cup team is up in arms. They believe that this arrangement
drives a winged-keel through a cost-control agreement ratified after the
1992 Cup. This limited competitors to two new hulls. Although a 75ft
carbon-fibre canoe body need cost only Dollars 1m or so, the research
underlying each new hull may cost 10 times that.
So, if Fischer and Bertrand are working as a single team, they might greatly
increase the effectiveness of their research and build three prototypes
where everyone else can build just one.
It looks certain to become a matter for the international jury convened to
administer the Cup. The US courts have already become involved. If
Bertrand's new boat proves fast this week, the already sharpened knives will
be out and flashing.
On the defender side, the dominant figure of Dennis Conner will be on the
water doing what he does best: learning everything and giving away nothing.
His Stars &amp; Stripes 91 is the oldest boat in the class and is scarcely
competitive. Yet with a new yacht due for delivery in mid-November, and
talent such as Paul Cayard to augment Conner's 20 years of Cup experience,
one should never underestimate him.
No one will be able to miss the Russian chartered entry from the St
Petersburg Yacht Club. For reasons not yet clear the old Il Moro I has been
repainted with a black hull and yellow decks and mast by her new crew and
renamed Vek Rossii. Since the New Zealand challenge is choosing to miss the
regatta for tactical reasons, at least there is no risk of the Ivans being
mistaken for the All-Blacks.
