FT  23 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Row over Treuhand's flagship railway sale
 -East Germans say rolling stock group is being sold too cheaply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of Russian and east European markets continues to haunt
Deutsche Waggonbau (DWA), the giant manufacturer of railway rolling stock
and one of the last industrial complexes under Germany's Treuhand
privatisation agency.
Once flagship of the former communist East Germany, the enterprise built
29,000 wagons for the Russian market after 1948. 'We were entirely dependent
on exports to Russia,' says Mr Peter Witt, DWA chairman.
Over nearly 40 years, DWA expanded rapidly. By 1989, turnover had exceeded
DM2bn (Dollars 1.27bn) and the future of the 24,500 workers seemed secure.
But the union of the two Germanys in 1990, followed by the collapse of
Comecon, the socialist trading organisation, entirely changed the
circumstances of the enterprise.
'Gradually the orders to Russia dried up,' says Mr Hans-Joachim Ratsch,
deputy head of the workers' council at DWA's plant at Ammendorf in
Saxony-Anhalt. 'Russia has no money to pay for its orders. We have to find
new markets. But time is running out.' The Ammendorf plant reduced its work
force from 4,700 before 1990 to 1,800 today. A further 800 jobs will be lost
over the next few years.
In an attempt to save DWA, one of the few remaining manufacturing outlets in
eastern Germany, the Treuhand and the finance ministry allocated substantial
aid to the company. Since 1991, DWA has received credits amounting to DM4bn
to help find new markets. A further DM250m was earmarked for investments,
and last September an additional DM500m was allocated to provide liquidity.
In the meantime, the total workforce has been reduced to 6,600, which DWA
officials admit is still too large.
The collapse of the Russian and east European markets and exposure to
competition has seriously affected DWA's turnover. Sales this year will
amount to about DM800m and losses will rise to DM43m. Turnover is expected
to slip to DM500m during 1995, unless there is any positive shift in the
Russian market.
But the collapse of the eastern markets, coupled with overcapacity in the
railway manufacturing industry, has in turn also made it difficult for the
Treuhand to find a buyer for DWA.
For political and social reasons, the Treuhand could not afford to close
down DWA completely. Nor could it split it up into separate entities and
sell each one off. Instead the Treuhand opted for privatising it as a whole.
Mr Witt denies this policy delayed the sale of DWA.
'DWA could not exist as a name or as a company if it was split up and sold
off in separate parts,' says Mr Witt, adding that this was exactly what
several west German companies wanted. 'The big western companies were afraid
of DWA becoming competitive.'
But now, after 38 companies have looked at but shied away from the sheer
size of DWA, the Treuhand is confident it has found a a buyer. Advent
International, the US-based venture capital investment group, is drawing up
a contract with the Treuhand to buy five of the remaining eight subsidiaries
of DWA.
According to DWA and Treuhand officials, Advent will buy 100 per cent of
DWA, will take Siemens, Germany's largest electronic and electrical company,
as its technological partner, and will eventually list DWA on the stock
exchange, possibly by 2005. Advent is not prepared to comment until the
contract is signed and sealed.
But the purchase price - and the number of workers Advent intends to retain
 -have caused a political row in eastern Germany. DWA officials confirmed
this week that Advent will pay, over time, DM112.8m for DWA, will guarantee
2,400 jobs, and invest DM250m.
'We have not given away DWA to Advent,' says Mr Witt. 'This is no present.
We have found a buyer which will allow us to pursue our strategy of finding
markets, introducing new products and become competitive.' Mr Witt also
insists that Advent will pursue 'a hands-off' management style and will not
interfere in the company.
Consultants involved in the negotiations between DWA and the Treuhand
contest this view. 'Advent is answerable to its investors, it manages those
funds on behalf of its institutional investors, who in turn will expect a
return on their investment,' the consultant says. 'Moreover, Advent is a
hands-on investment group. If the management of DWA thinks otherwise, it is
mistaken.'
Despite the differences in expectations of management style, Mr Witt remains
confident that DWA can be turned around by Advent. He says DWA, against
strong competition, has won orders from Berlin to build carriages for the
city's train system, and is co-operating with Siemens, AEG and other
companies. But he also knows that any big improvement in turnover, and
attempts to save more than 2,400 jobs, will depend on receiving large orders
from Russia. On that point, few at DWA, or the Treuhand, are hopeful.
'If we want to survive and prosper, we have no other choice but to become
competitive in the European markets. I think it can be done. But I know we
have to rationalise even further,' says Mr Witt.

<TEXT>
An agreement between Kazakhstan, Russia and a western consortium to develop
the giant Karachaganak natural gas field in Kazakhhstan could be signed as
early as the middle of next month, according to officials close to the
negotiations.
Talks in Almaty between British Gas, its Italian partner Agip and the Kazakh
government are reported to have made progress in recent weeks. But detailed
negotiations due over the next few weeks between the western companies and
Gazprom, the Russian state gas monopoly, must be concluded before a final
agreement can be signed.
Kazakh officials had hoped that the talks would have been concluded by last
week, but a number of issues remain to be resolved. The next round of
negotiations are likely to focus on the terms of Gazprom's participation in
the project and arrangements for the transport of Kazakh gas and liquid
condensate, a naturally occuring gasoline, across Russian territory.
British Gas and Agip have had the exclusive right to negotiate a contract to
develop Karachaganak since 1992. Original plans did not include direct
Russian participation. But in recent months it has become apparent that
Russia wants equity participation in all main energy projects planned in the
former Soviet republics.
Gazprom discovered and partially developed Karachaganak during the Soviet
era. The field contains proven reserves of 1,300bn cubic metres of natural
gas, 650m tonnes of condensate and 200m tonnes of oil.

European Union ministers yesterday formally cleared the Uruguay Round trade
accord for ratification, rubber stamping a decision taken earlier this week,
writes Emma Tucker in Brussels.
The move allows the EU to send the necessary papers to Geneva on December
30, meeting an end-of-year deadline allowing Gatt's successor, the World
Trade Organisation, to be set-up on January 1, 1995. Commission officials
are confident all member states will have completed ratification in national
parliaments by December 30. One said that by this weekend only Portugal,
Spain and Greece would still have to complete the domestic approval process.
The package includes tariff cuts on industrial and farm goods by an average
of over 35 per cent.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Ukraine secures Dollars 500m loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank yesterday approved a Dollars 500m loan to support the
transition to a market economy in Ukraine.
The aid, for essential imports, came after the former Soviet republic
committed itself to free more prices, revive mass privatisation, and reform
the ailing agriculture and energy sectors.
The bank's decision follows the International Monetary Fund's endorsement of
President Leonid Kuchma's economic reform efforts with a Dollars 371m loan
in October.
Talks on a Dollars 1.5bn stand-by loan continue next month, with
disbursement possible as early as February, Ukrainian and aid officials
said.
While the quick disbursements reflect an effort to help Mr Kuchma overcome
Ukraine's economic crisis, aid officials remain concerned about
implementation.
Under the IMF deal, Ukraine agreed to pay for energy imports but the failure
to cover Turkmen gas imports this quarter sparked a row within the
government. A top energy official last week was sacked by Mr Kuchma, who
promised to pay Turkmenistan after the funds earmarked for imports were
diverted.
Under the bank loan, the largest amount of western assistance so far,
Ukraine committed itself to sell 8,000 medium and large enterprises and 90
per cent of small enterprises. A voucher scheme will be used at pilot
auctions, scheduled for February 1, which allows Ukraine to get around
parliament's moratorium on cash privatisation.
These steps face resistance from Ukraine's conservative ministries and
parliament. To gain more control over the reform process Mr Kuchma proposed
centralising authority with the president. The law was debated in parliament
yesterday. Mr Kuchma told deputies: 'Without radical political changes,
radical economic reforms are impossible. If the parliament cannot agree to
this, I will have to ask the people directly, through a referendum.'

Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of Germany's Christian Democrats in the
Bundestag, said yesterday he was in a 'close consensus' on European Union
reform with France's centre-right Union for French Democracy (UDF), but was
still 'not in harmony' with the Gaullist RPR party, which considered German
conservatives' reform plans too supranational. Mr Schauble's remarks
underlined the degree to which European policy will divide the UDF and RPR
in the French presidential election. Mr Schauble told a press conference
that he had carefully avoided the words 'federation' or 'confederation' in
his talks with French politicians, who had initially reacted badly to the
plan backed by Mr Schauble describing the European Commission as an embryo
European government. Nonetheless, the leader of the Bundestag conservatives
insisted that the EU had certain 'qualities of a state', and said Bonn's
desire for an important role for the Strasbourg parliament and the
Commission would be 'among the hardest issues' in its relations with Paris.

After years of delay caused by worries about crime and waves of refugees,
border controls within Europe will be eliminated next March 26 - at least in
seven of the 12 members of the European Union. The accord 'is a historic
step on the way to full freedom of movement in all Europe and means an
increase in security for our citizens', Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, the German
minister responsible for European affairs, said yesterday in Bonn. Ministers
from the participating countries met in Bonn to complete the accord, which
means that inner-European border controls, which already have partly
disappeared, will fall away completely. It applies from the Mediterranean to
the North Sea. The participants are Portugal, Spain, France, Germany,
Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. Italy and Greece have said they
will join when they overcome technical problems. The only EU members not in
the pact are Britain, Ireland and Denmark. Austria, one of three countries
joining the EU in 1995, is expected to accept the elimination of border
controls with EU countries, but the others, Sweden and Finland, will not.

Bosnia's Moslem-led government appeared to be close to a comprehensive
ceasefire with the Bosnian Serbs yesterday, despite a mortar attack that
killed two men in Sarajevo. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN official in former
Yugoslavia, said the two sides were 'pretty close to the final agreement' on
the text of the ceasefire, brokered this week by Mr Jimmy Carter, the former
US president.
The Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said yesterday that he had
issued an order for his men to cease fire today even if Moslem troops do not
withdraw from Mount Igman, overlooking Sarajevo, in time for signing the
truce accord. Referring to the Moslem withdrawal, Mr Karadzic said: 'We do
not make it a precondition for the start of the ceasefire. We understand the
withdrawal of Moslem troops should be completed by tomorrow noon, but if it
is technically difficult we will wait one or two days.' Mr Akashi held talks
with Mr Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale earlier in the day
to discuss the truce and said he was hoping to have an accord signed by
Friday afternoon. The earlier mortar attack on the main open market in
Sarajevo, where 68 people were killed by a mortar in February in the worst
single atrocity of the 32-month war, appeared to come from the Serb-held
area of Grbavica, the UN said.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Palace guard is power behind Yeltsin's throne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
General Alexander Korzhakov is the most powerful secret policeman in the
world.
Head of President Boris Yeltsin's personal guard, he has been revealed - by
the leaking in yesterday's FT of a letter he wrote to Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, instructing him to review
agreements he had made with the World Bank - as an official who acts on his
own authority in the core decisions on the Russian economy. For a man who
was until the early 1990s a middle ranking officer in the KGB, this is a
remarkable rise.
It is also a disturbing one.
General Korzhakov's influence stems from his closeness to the president and
from his command of a guard which has swollen to a force of several
thousand, comprising elite detachments trained in anti-terrorist warfare and
intelligence operations. All major states have such forces but they are
generally distanced from ministerial decisions, are under some form of
legislative oversight and are increasingly obliged to present an account of
their activities to the public. General Korzhakov answers to President
Yeltsin alone.
If his actions are masked, his influence is an open matter. He has for the
past year featured among the top 20 most influential figures in Russia,
published monthly in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta. President Yeltsin
himself named him in his recent memoirs as his closest and most trusted
aide, and as a friend.
He earned that trust. Assigned to Mr Yeltsin as his KGB guard when the
latter joined the politbureau in 1987, Lieutenant Colonel Korzhakov stayed
with Mr Yeltsin in his wilderness years after 1988, when he was ejected from
the politbureau and left the Communist party.
He suffered too. He was fired from the KGB's ninth department (the
politbureau guards), being promoted to colonel only when Mr Yeltsin became
head of the Russian Supreme Soviet. After the latter was elected president
of Russia, he was promoted again, to major general.
General Korzhakov's presidential security service was then part of the main
guard department, the force commanded by Lieutenant General Mikhail
Barsukov. According to the Kommersant daily, which researched the force a
year ago, it already comprised the presidential guard, a motorised rifle
brigade, the former KGB ninth department, part of the KGB's fifth department
which had specialised in spying on dissidents, elements of the KGB's
technical operations department and the elite anti-terrorist forces named
Alpha and Vympel.
In his only (uninformative) interview, given to Nezavimiaya Gazeta on
November 16 this year, General Korzhakov revealed that the presidential
guard had for the past year not been under the control of General Barsukov's
main guard department.
'In November 1993,' he said, 'its status was raised - the service left the
main guard department and received greater independence in dealing with day
to day issues which did not contradict the existing legislation, in
accordance with the will of the president'. General Korzhakov did not refer
to a decree or law conferring this independence on his department.
Asked by the interviewer what his basic function was, he said the most
important part of it was acquiring information on any threat to the security
of the president. 'We invest this part of our work with the greatest
importance, and we certainly pay particular attention to any information
touching on the spheres of our interests.'
General Korzhakov is coming more and more into the limelight - a position he
will not like. It is rumoured he made the decision Mr Yeltsin should not be
woken to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the then Irish prime minister, at Shannon
airport in September.
Earlier this month, members of his service arrested and beat up the head of
the personal guard of Mr Vladimir Gusinsky, chairman of the Most finance
group, outside the group's headquarters in central Moscow. The reason they
gave was Mr Gusinsky's guard was armed, and travelling on the route taken by
the president. The insiders' explanation was it was designed to frighten Mr
Gusinsky, and through him his close ally, Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the powerful
mayor of Moscow, seen as a competitor to Mr Yeltsin.
These palace intrigues reflect an administration with no strong centre, but
with secretive barons acting in the name of the titular head. Mr Yeltsin,
only just out of a clinic, is thought to work relatively few hours a day. In
his absence, the running of the office falls on those who enjoy his greatest
trust. General Korzhakov is chief among them.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Political interference in Hungarian privatisations angers
foreign investors
</HEADLINE>

For foreign investors who hoped Hungary's new Socialist-led government would
carry out its election pledge to speed up and clean up privatisation, the
sale of HungarHotels, the last state hotel chain, has not been an auspicious
start.
First came political pressure to ignore an international tender and hand
over the hotels chain to the cash-strapped social security fund. Then there
were poorly-handled negotiations in which the top bidder was abruptly asked
to raise its price by 15 per cent at the last moment after already
outbidding its nearest rival by more than 20 per cent. Just when a deal was
finally struck last week, the prime minister called an investigation into
the sale. The investigation team is due to report by today.
The controversial sale comes just as Hungary, the pioneer of market-led
reforms in eastern Europe, is preparing to privatise several of its largest
companies, including most of its energy sector.
One banker said: 'This deal has been deeply disturbing. It makes me think
we're in for a bumpy road with this government in the future. If they can't
sell a hotel chain, will they part with their gas and electricity
companies?'
A much-publicised bill which will radically alter privatisation strategy and
merge the State Property Agency (SPA) and the State Holding Company (SHC),
the two main privatisation bodies, was due to be discussed by parliament
this autumn. It is now unlikely to be passed before March. The uncertainty
this has created has demoralised and weakened both institutions. Several key
members of staff have left for more lucrative jobs in the private sector.
Others, such as Mr Lajos Csepi, former head of the SHC, have been sacked.
Advisers say quality has suffered and some of the privatisations under way
are being poorly prepared.
The privatisation of Gyortej, a dairy in Gyor in north-western Hungary, in
which foreign investors lost out to local bidders backed by the ministry of
agriculture, shows the pitfalls that await foreign bidders.
After a competitive tender, the dairy was awarded to a consortium of the
investment arm of Budapest City Council and 27 farming co-operatives from
Fejer County. The decision was made against the advice of case officers in
the agriculture ministry and the SPA and after the consortium was allowed to
raise its price at the last moment without the foreign investors being
offered the same option.
The losing bidder for the dairy was Konzum, a listed Hungarian company owned
by foreign institutional investors. Its bid also included the dairy's
management and milk producers from the Gyor region.
The two groups prepared their bids just as the new government was drawing up
its privatisation strategy. This emphasised cash sales to strategic partners
would be preferred over other forms of privatisation. It also pledged to
provide more investment opportunities for holders of compensation coupons
(CCs) which were issued to victims of the former communist regime. The
coupons, which trade on the secondary market for less than half their
official value, can be used in privatisations for the full nominal value.
Konzum says senior SPA and ministry of agriculture officials told it a
strong element of cash, as well as a good business plan and the inclusion of
the management in its bid would help it win the tender. Therefore rather
than offering a bid totally in CCs, it bid 38 per cent in cash and the rest
in coupons. It also offered an immediate cash injection of Ft300m (Dollars
2.7m) for the dairy which is heavily indebted. The business plan was
evaluated by the SPA at 11 out of 15.
The winning consortium offered just CCs and a future Ft180m share offering
which was less than the Ft200m capital increase stipulated in the tender
documents. Its business plan scored 1 out of 15.
This consortium won because, with CCs taken at nominal value, its bid for
the 51 per cent stake was Ft655m. Konzum's bid was Ft527m. However, if
Konzum had used its cash portion to buy CCs its offer would have been worth
Ft756m. This led the case officer in the agriculture ministry to conclude
the two offers 'cannot be compared realistically'. Given the many other
factors in Konzum's favour, the case officer recommended it be awarded the
dairy.
This recommendation was overruled at a higher level in the ministry.
Moreover, in the two days before a final decision was taken, the consortium
was unilaterally allowed to raise its price to Ft755m even though this is
against SPA internal rules. Konzum says it was not given the chance to alter
its bid or raise its price.
In explaining the move, Mr Erno Racz, an SPA deputy managing director, said
the decision was taken for 'very important political reasons'. The
government had to honour its pledge to allow CC holders to use the coupons
at full value for good assets and the consortium had offered more in CC
terms. Original holders of CCs should be preferred over the 'financial
speculators' who bought them up on the secondary market.
He said a capital increase via a share offering was preferable to Konzum's
cash injection as a 'foreign investor could take its cash out of the company
whenever it wanted'.
Further, he said the privatisation authorities were under pressure to find
local buyers for companies in the food industry and in Gyor county which
borders Austria. He said Austrian companies, which have invested heavily in
the region, had a 'dangerous influence' in the county.
'There have been questions in parliament demanding how we could let the
whole food industry fall into the hands of foreigners,' he said. 'What was
more important - to allow Hungarian co-operatives to win the tender or to
get some millions of forints and generate a political storm in Hungary?'
This last statement has led Konzum, which has spent more than Dollars
160,000 in advisers' fees on its bid, to ask why the tender was open to
foreign investors. Mr Albert von Pappenheim, chairman, said: 'We expected
more from the new government. We have not been treated fairly or legally.
Why on earth should we invest more money in this country?'

FT  23 DEC 94 / Bundesbank sets tight monetary policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Bundesbank yesterday set a tight monetary target for next year and
warned industry, trade unions and the federal and state governments against
following policies that could push up inflation.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German central bank, gave no hint of
future interest policy, but some economists said the money-supply goal for
1995 could only be achieved if interest rates rose. 'The Bundesbank will be
forced to act,' said Mr Adolf Rosenstock, Frankfurt-based economist at
Industrial Bank of Japan.
The bank set its target range for M3, the broad monetary aggregate, at
between 4 and 6 per cent. This is unchanged from 1994, but because of the
way the rate is calculated - on an annualised basis from fourth quarter to
fourth quarter - it implies a much lower average growth rate of 3.5 per cent
after this year's 9 per cent.
Thus, said Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank: 'The Bundesbank likely
will have to tighten interest rate policy markedly in the course of the
year.' It said monetary tightening would be appropriate because of expected
higher wage rises, rising import prices and price pressures at the producer
level. Official figures yesterday showed a rise of 0.4 per cent in west
German producer prices in November over October.
The Bundesbank said its monetary policies in 1995 would be aimed at
dampening price growth further and creating monetary conditions for lasting
economic growth. It reaffirmed its commitment to M3 as its main policy
yardstick, despite the extreme growth rates experienced earlier this year.
To encourage funds to move out of short-term deposits (included in M3) into
longer-term investments, the Bundesbank cut interest rates earlier this
year. Sine May, the discount and Lombard rates have been unchanged at 4.5
and 6 per cent respectively.
With an annualised growth rate in M3 of 6 per cent in November, the
Bundesbank's money-supply target is now being met. However, the trend has
been helped by the introduction of money-market funds into Germany. If these
were included in M3, the November rate would have been 6.9 per cent.
The Bundesbank will improve its monitoring of monetary trends by including
these funds into 'expanded M3', which also includes traditional M3 (cash,
short- and medium-term deposits and savings) and deposits in foreign
branches of German banks.
The M3 target range allows for potential economic growth of 2.75 per cent
and inflation of 2 per cent - the Bundesbank's medium-term goal - with 1 per
cent to allow for a slowdown in the velocity of money in circulation. Mr
Tietmeyer said money supply was more than adequate after this year's strong
increase.
He said the bank's anti-inflationary stance needed government support in
reining back spending, and from wage negotiators in reaching moderate
settlements. He warned companies contemplating high price rises that 'the
monetary conditions will not be created for this'. Although the Bundesbank's
inflation goal was 2 per cent, he said he would like to see the rate lower.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Mexico floats peso after financial crisis intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The financial crisis facing Mexico's new government intensified yesterday as
the peso fell sharply for the second successive day.
Big outflows of funds from the country on Wednesday forced the government to
float the peso, abandoning a long-held policy in which the currency was kept
within a specified target zone.
The government, which said it would return to targeting the currency when
the market had stabilised, also announced a 60-day wage and price freeze.
It activated a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.9bn) credit line with the US
established last March, when a political crisis threatened to undermine the
currency's stability. An additional Dollars 1bn is available from Canada.
The crisis calls into question the direction of economic and political
policy under President Ernesto Zedillo who took office on December 1, and
has left foreign and domestic investors questioning his government's
credibility.
The peso closed at 4.9 to the dollar in thin trading, a devaluation of
almost 40 per cent since the beginning of the year. The peso closed on
Monday at 3.45 and on Tuesday at just below 4.00.
Mexico's stock market had risen from its lows by midday - but was still
sharply down in dollar terms - and the impact of the crisis affected other
Latin American markets. The Brazilian stock market closed 6.1 per cent down
while the Argentine market ended 3 per cent lower.
Finance ministry officials said the moves were precipitated by a drastic
fall in international reserves, which made it impossible for the central
bank to defend the peso and keep it within the trading band. The band had
been lowered by 15 per cent on Tuesday, but it was not enough to relieve the
pressure on the peso.
Mr Jaime Serra Puche, the finance minister, flew to the US yesterday for
talks with US government officials, and also spoke to big institutional
investors in an attempt to calm nerves.
'We took a pretty hard hit,' said a senior finance ministry official. 'We
had to let it (the trading band) go.' The official said international
reserves stood at about Dollars 7bn, down about Dollars 10bn from November
1. Reserves stood at almost Dollars 29bn in February.
The IPC index, the main indicator of the Mexican stock market, closed up
4.66 per cent after zigzagging all day. But Mexican equities in New York
were off sharply, with the most actively traded stock - Telmex - closing at
Dollars 40 5/8 , down nearly 10 per cent.
Analysts said the devaluation would make the Mexican government's 1995
forecast of 4 per cent economic growth and 4 per cent inflation obsolete.
But the government stressed that the 1995 budget would remain balanced.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Cunard chief set to face angry QE2 passengers: Move to avert
threatened sit-in over conditions aboard luxury liner after refit delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Olsen, chief executive of Cunard, the UK cruise line, was preparing
to board the Queen Elizabeth 2 cruise ship in New York yesterday to avert a
threatened sit-in by 150 passengers angry over conditions on board.
Passengers have complained of 'building site' conditions, 'stinking'
swimming pools and closed facilities resulting from delays in completing a
Pounds 30m refit.
The QE2 was expected in New York at 8pm local time after a stormy crossing.
Some passengers were due to disembark and others were scheduled to join the
vessel before it continued on its journey to the Caribbean.
Mr Olsen, appearing at a press conference in New York, acknowledged that
there had been difficulties aboard the vessel. Asked to comment on reports
of exploding toilets, he said the biggest single issue had involved the
plumbing.
'It's an extremely complicated science to get it right, and there were cases
of foreign objects and soiled water in the cabins,' he said.
Mr Olsen also acknowledged that two of the public areas, the Lido and the
Yacht Club, had been out of action during the voyage, but said they were now
open. He said he would be using them to address all the passengers.
Mr Andrew Lennox, spokesperson for a protest group threatening not to leave
the ship unless Mr Olsen came aboard, said last night passengers would be
demanding an official apology from Cunard for the conditions they had faced.
They also wanted a promise of compensation, and the chance to express
concerns about safety on the ship. 'My aim in forming this group was simply
to give everybody the opportunity of facing an executive from Cunard and
letting him know what they thought,' Mr Lennox said by satellite telephone
from the QE2.
Mr Olsen said Cunard originally expected the QE2 to leave New York with
about 1,400 passengers aboard. Instead it would only accommodate 750, about
250 of whom had joined it in Southampton and the rest of whom would join it
in New York. Among those disembarking would be 300-400 contractors who had
been working to complete the refurbishment during the transatlantic voyage.
The liner was due to leave New York at midnight.
However, Mr Lennox said last night he did not believe those joining in New
York could be accommodated, as many cabins were still unfinished.
'Cunard will have a lot of egg on their faces, when everybody gets off the
ship and people see the state it is in,' he said.
Mr Olsen said the QE2 was like a 'national heritage monument' in the UK and
it was astonishing how much attention the ship created.
He refused to say whether Cunard would sue the contractors, but said
everyone involved in the refit knew the tight time frame and had signed up
to it.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Court review for Guinness case: Appeal to reconsider
convictions after allegations of evidence being withheld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, WILLIAM LEWIS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Home Office has asked the Court of Appeal to review the convictions of
the four original Guinness trial defendants because of allegations that
material evidence was withheld from the defence.
The appeal will consider whether to quash the convictions against former
Guinness chief executive Mr Ernest Saunders, the property tycoon Mr Gerald
Ronson, the former stockbroker Mr Tony Parnes and Mr Jack Lyons, the
financier.
Mr Saunders, Mr Ronson and Mr Parnes were all jailed. Mr Lyons, a friend of
former prime minister, Baroness Thatcher, was spared going to jail because
of ill-health, but was stripped of his knighthood.
The appeal, expected to be heard in the next six weeks, relates to a claim
that the Serious Fraud Office withheld material evidence from the four
defendants in the case, which ran from February to August in 1990.
Mr Keith Oliver, a solicitor acting for Mr Parnes, said the alleged evidence
showed that share support operations, of the kind practised in the Guinness
case, were common City practice in the 1980s.
It is alleged that this evidence was in the hands of the Serious Fraud
Office, which prosecuted the case, before the trial began.
This alleged evidence relates to at least six other cases of indemnified
share support operations - where payments are made to individuals or
institutions for buying shares - being used at about the same time as
Guinness's Pounds 2.6bn takeover bid for Distillers in January 1986.
Details of other such operations were given to the Department of Trade and
Industry by directors of TWH/NV, a licensed share-dealing firm, during a
separate investigation and then passed to the SFO.
Part of the evidence was disclosed during a case held by a City of London
tribunal in December 1988 on whether TWH/NV should be allowed to keep its
licence to deal in securities, which TWH/NV won. But this evidence was not
made available to the defence during the original Guinness trial.
The Home Office said: 'Representations were made to the secretary of state
that evidence had come to light of documents which were not disclosed either
at trial or at appeal.'
The SFO said it would strongly contest the appeal: 'What has come to light
is not new evidence. It is unused material which was not regarded as
relevant at the time (of the trial of the original defendants).'
The future of the SFO, set up in the late 1980s to handle cases of complex
financial crime, is currently under review by the government because a
number of its high-profile prosecutions have collapsed in embarrassing
circumstances. The Guinness convictions were always held up by the SFO as an
example of its success. A former government official, Mr Rex Davie, is
completing a report for the attorney-general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, on whether
the SFO should lose its independence and be put under the aegis of the Crown
Prosecution Service.
If the appeal is successful, the four businessmen men convicted in the case
are likely to ask for compensation running to millions of pounds.
A friend of Mr Lyons said he would ask for the return of his knighthood.

FT  23 DEC 94 / Italy searches for new prime minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, resigned yesterday,
leaving President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro with the delicate choice of finding a
new government or dissolving parliament.
Mr Berlusconi, in office for 226 days at the head of a rightwing coalition,
is pressing for early elections to vindicate his views and obtain a fresh
mandate. But the president has made clear that he will explore all options
and that he opposes the dissolution of parliament so soon after the March
1994 general election.
A solution has been complicated both by the increasingly polarised political
atmosphere and by divisions within the populist Northern League, a coalition
partner, over the decision by Mr Umberto Bossi, its leader, to bring a
no-confidence motion against the government.
Financial markets showed some relief that the lingering fate of the
government had been decided. But the Bank of Italy's latest monthly figures
on foreign exchange reserves reflected the impact of the sustained pressure
on the lira, with losses of more than L11,000bn (Pounds 4.27bn) since July.
'The government's resignation unfortunately confirms the prospect of a long
and difficult transition towards a new politico-institutional alignment,'
observed Mr Luigi Abete, the head of Confindustria, the industrialists'
confederation.
The Northern League proposed the no-confidence motion last weekend together
with the centrist Popular party. The former communist Party of the Left
(PDS) put forward a second no-confidence motion, and a third came from
Reconstituted Communism, the hardline core of the old Italian Communist
party.
Mr Berlusconi resigned before the end of the no-confidence debate, in part
to avoid the provisions of the league motion. One clause of this would have
barred him from future office because of the conflict of interest resulting
from his ownership of the Fininvest business empire.
Throughout his eight-month government, Mr Berlusconi has been at odds with
the head of state and their hostile relationship will influence the outcome
of this crisis.
The president is expected to do his best to avoid asking Mr Berlusconi to
either head a new government or be in charge of anything other than the
shortest of caretaker administrations. He regards the outgoing prime
minister as in good measure responsible for his own downfall. Mr Scalfaro is
concerned about the unresolved questions of conflict of interest and Mr
Berlusconi's investigation by Milan anti-corruption magistrates.
Yesterday, the Milan judiciary reminded Mr Berlusconi of his potential
difficulties when they sentenced his younger brother, Paolo, to seven months
in prison for corruption related to waste disposal contracts.
Mr Scalfaro will begin preliminary soundings with two former Italian
presidents today, but the core discussions with political leaders will be
held next week.

FT  22 DEC 94 / World Bank agrees Dollars 40m emergency loan for Haiti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank has approved a Dollars 40m emergency loan for Haiti, the
first of an estimated Dollars 663m in various credits expected over the next
12-18 months, as the international community attempts to assist the poorest
country in the western hemisphere.
The first Dollars 20m could be distributed 'in a matter of weeks to get the
machinery of the private sector going again', according to Mr Rainer
Steckhan, director of special operations. The so called 'fast disbursing'
loan is from the World Bank's soft-loan arm, the International Development
Association. It will be used to provide emergency supplies, such as
medicine, spare parts and oil.
This will be the first new lending for Haiti since the military overthrew
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. The World Bank board gave its
approval after Haiti on Monday paid its arrears to the multilateral
institutions with Dollars 82m in aid contributed from 10 countries. Haiti's
Congress was expected to approve the package yesterday.
The donors included the US, Japan, Switzerland, France, Canada, the
Netherlands and Switzerland.
Also contributing were Argentina, Mexico and the Dominican Republic, 'an
expression of solidarity in the hemisphere', which World Bank officials said
they found encouraging.
The IDA on Tuesday also unfroze funds for six projects under way in Haiti
when lending was cut off. The balance - about Dollars 104m - will go towards
the projects to develop water supplies, industry, power, transport and
health.
With no real precedents for rescuing a country so poor, newly returned to
democracy, the banks are moving swiftly but cautiously. Disbursements will
be closely monitored.

About 20 people were killed in two days of ethnic attacks in Burundi's
capital Bujumbura which have brought the city close to a standstill, police
said yesterday. Residents said Tuesday night was punctuated by the blasts of
about 50 hand grenades and outbreaks of shooting following the killing of
five people - most of them members of the Hutu majority - in the main market
on Tuesday.
There have been widespread fears of a full-blown ethnic war after genocide
between April and July in neighbouring Rwanda, Burundi's ethnic twin. In
October and November, hundreds of people in Burundi were killed in attacks
by Hutu extremists and in army reprisals
The latest attacks focused on the capital's northeast district of Bwiza,
where witnesses said at least a dozen houses were set ablaze and destroyed.
Buildings were still burning yesterday. Troops in Bwiza, one of the few
remaining mixed districts of Tutsis and Hutus, told reporters at least 10
people were killed.

<TEXT>
President Lech Walesa of Poland yesterday criticised the leftist government
for choosing 'easy solutions' and overlooking the real problems of the
people. Mr Walesa was meeting leaders of the Polish Peasant's party and the
Democratic Left Alliance, comprising former communists, as well as senior
members of the cabinet. The two-hour debate, broadcast live on state radio
and television, focused mainly on government budget policy and public
spending.
Earlier in the day, Mr Walesa vetoed a government bill on public sector
wages, criticised by the Solidarity trade union as not ensuring parity to
wages among industrial workers. He urged the government to look for
additional sources of government revenue which could enable higher public
spending. However, the cabinet is pressing to have its 1995 spending plan
approved by parliament by the year's end, seeing it as a basis for economic
stability that would allow further reforms.
Opposition leaders have also criticised the budget as inflationary and a
threat to further economic growth through its excessive taxes. Mr Walesa
suggested the government could find additional resources by expanding the
privatisation process, which could improve the condition of many ailing
state enterprises and thus increase tax revenues.

Mr Gerard Cole, the former chairman of Francaise des Jeux, the French
lottery, was yesterday in police custody following a probe by public
prosecutors in Nanterre. Mr Cole, who was a former adviser to President
Francois Mitterrand, was strongly criticised in a report on the lottery
published last year by the French financial inspection body. He has defended
himself against accusations, including abuse of funds, but nevertheless
resigned his position last December after prosectors began investigations in
February 1993. He had been appointed in 1989.
Separately yesterday, a French judge investigating corruption in the funding
of political parties was embarrassed by accusations made against his
father-in-law. Judge Eric Halphen expressed surprise that his relative - who
had been taken into police custody - had allegedly received money from the
wife of a suspect in a probe into RPR funding.

FT  22 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Halifax move hits insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An announcement that the UK's largest building society, Halifax, would be
cutting its household insurance premiums hit its main underwriter Sun
Alliance and knocked the whole sector as the market appreciated that a fat
earner was coming to an end.
Building societies have been able to charge high rates for their household
cover, which is usually provided at the same time as the mortgage. However,
increasing competition from outside - particularly the arrival of Direct
Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBoS) subsidiary, and reorganisation
within the industry - has meant that margins are under pressure.
Sun Alliance takes around 70 per cent of the Halifax household cover, and
some analysts estimate that the building society provides around 4 per cent
of the company's premium income. SA fell 13 to 300p.
Some analysts argued that the news was an own goal for Sun Alliance, which
had initiated the move. They felt that the group was attempting to show it
was the most competitive in order to maintain its grip on the business ahead
of the Halifax merger with the Leeds Building Society.
General Accident, which is the second underwriter for the Halifax, fell 11
to 519p, while Royal Insurance, the main underwriter for the Leeds, shed 9
to 279p. The Leeds and Halifax received merger clearance from the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission yesterday. RBoS declined 8 to 407p.
Property stocks moved sharply ahead as the sector reacted to a press report
suggesting that the Kuwaiti government had been offered Pounds 1.5bn by an
investment consortium for its St Martins Property group. St Martins owns
some of London's most valuable properties.
Hammerson climbed 16 to 343p, while British Land gained 16 at 376p, with
Goldman Sachs reported to have been a particularly keen bidder for the stock
for most of the session. Land Securities added a more modest 2 at 588p.
Volume for most property stocks remained light and dealers said the day's
advance may have been overdone. One analyst commented: 'There is relief in
some quarters that someone is willing to put money into the property sector,
but today's moves are clearly overdone.'
Elsewhere in the sector, Stanhope improved 2 to 7p on hopes that the group's
bankers will announce a financial rescue plan today. The market continues to
believe that British Land will bid for Stanhope.
Pharmaceuticals leader Glaxo led the sector higher as the market absorbed
news that the patent for Zantac, its key anti-ulcer treatment, was being
extended.
Mr Paul Woodhouse of Smith New Court argued that the extra 19 months grace
gave time for Glaxo's new key products - particularly its hepatitis B and
influenza treatments - to kick in. The news has added to the sector
enthusiasm drifting in from the US and helped to harden the bid premiums
that have attached to some components. It ensured that Glaxo jumped 22 1/2
to 685p, the Footsie's biggest percentage rise, on turnover of 14m shares.
Wellcome was lifted 10 to 706p, SmithKline Beecham 8 1/2 to 472 1/2 p and
Zeneca 12 to a record 899p.
Bid speculation generated buying of the regional electricity companies. The
latest talk saw South Western move to the top of the list of bid candidates.
No particular company was named as the most likely suitor, but one market
watcher suggested it was unlikely to be another electricity company. The
shares rose 10 to 867p.
Northern, already under siege from conglomerate Trafalgar House which last
week announced a Pounds 1.2bn bid, gave up 2 to 1000p as dealers decided
that the planned takeover was likely to be referred to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
There were strong hints late in the day that Swiss Bank, acting for
Trafalgar, would launch a market raid on Northern today to buy up to 10 per
cent of Northern's shares. Trafalgar hardened a penny to 75p. However, James
Capel urged investors to sell, saying: 'A profits recovery from the group's
existing activities is already well discounted at the current share price.'
Profit-taking left London Electricity 15 down at 747p. Among water stocks,
the bid talk settled on Welsh Water, where the shares moved 15 ahead to
638p.
Food and drinks giant Allied Domecq slipped 10 1/2 to 553 1/2 p in response
to a 15 per cent devaluation of the Peso. Allied earns around 6 per cent of
total trading profits from Mexico.
Greenalls Group relinquished 8 at 434p, with traders switching from the
ordinary shares and into the convertible stock.
Invesco was the most heavily traded stock in London after Istituto Mobiliare
Italiano (IMI) sold most of its 24.75m shares in the company. The placing
was carried out by Lehman Brothers. The shares eased a penny to 163p.
Telegraph jumped 33 to 390p as Hollinger, the parent group, said it intended
to buy back 7m shares at 450p a share.
Specialty chemicals group Hickson International plunged after the group
warned that profits would be hit because of the loss of a soap powder
contract for next year. The shares closed 12 lower at 114p.
Cable television group TeleWest Communications wilted 3 to 176 1/2 p.
Recently floated at 182p, they have been hit by flow-back from the US
tranche of the issue.
Mobile phones group Vodafone rose 4 1/2 to 211p ahead of subscriber figures
for the key Christmas quarter. Hoare Govett estimates 20 per cent growth
over the September quarter.
Vickers declined for the second day running in spite of the way most
analysts found clear favour with the engines collaboration deal between the
group's Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary and BMW, of Germany. The shares
softened 2 1/2 to 176p.
A reduce note from NatWest which set a target price of 134p helped to clip
British Steel, but after a steady two-way business the shares ended
unchanged at 157p on 4.4m turnover.
Alfred McAlpine and aggregates group Bardon stood out among construction
shares. McAlpine advanced 8 to 171p while Bardon, heavily dealt in turnover
of 10m, was a penny better at 31p.
Several agency crosses at 30 1/2 p accounted for the bulk of the Bardon
trading as the shares came in for a buy recommendation from UBS.
Textiles group Coats Viyella ng any obvious cheer to a sector under pressure
from raw material prices and soft sales.

FT  22 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Talk of imminent market raid boosts
equities - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There were strong rumours circulating late yesterday that Trafalgar House
was about to launch a market raid to buy up to 10 per cent of Northern
Electric stock. Trafalgar announced a Pounds 1.2bn bid for Northern last
week.
The Trafalgar rumour was only one factor boosting the UK market. Stock
market analysts refused to rule out a FT-SE 100 level of 3,100 before the
end of the year as Wall Street's bullish response to news from the US that
the Federal Reserve is leaving short-term interest rates unchanged for the
near future helped drive UK equities into a better position yesterday.
At the close of a surprisingly busy trading session the FT-SE 100 Index was
12.3 higher at 3,070.4. The market's second liners, however, were much more
subdued, with the FT-SE Mid 250 Index only 2.9 firmer at 3,466.6.
The upsurge on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Average was up over 40
points some two hours after London closed, took traders in the UK by
surprise. 'It was always felt in London that the Federal Reserve would not
move on rates until it had examined very closely all the economic details
from the fourth quarter,' said an economist at one of the leading UK banks.
He said a minor reaction on Wall Street had been expected after the Fed news
emerged. The Dow Jones closed the previous night down over 21 points
although selling pressure was said to have been light.
One reason put forward by dealers to explain the strong performance by
London share prices, apart from Wall Street's influence, was the unusually
heavy level of customer business for a trading session so close to
Christmas. Dealers pointed out that the business driving the market forward
was entirely in the cash market: 'Turnover in the future was the quietest
for many months,' said one derivatives specialist.
'There is still some very big business going on in the market and it is not
just programme trading, it's genuine investment activity and it's very
encouraging,' said a senior marketmaker.
London has been driven ahead strongly in recent sessions by takeover
activity, notably Trafalgar House's bid for Northern Electric and the agreed
bid for Portals by De La Rue. Talk in the market over the past couple of
weeks has centred on the potential for an upsurge of takeover activity in
the first quarter of the New Year.
Turnover yesterday reached 584.9m by 5pm, with non-FT-SE stocks accounting
for 65 per cent of the total. Customer business on Tuesday was an
encouraging Pounds 1.3bn.
The eventual outcome of the day was a sharp reversal of early trends in the
market. The FT-SE 100 had opened lower, down over eight points, unsettled by
news of a price war in UK buildings insurance.
Little selling pressure developed across the wider market, however, and a
better tone quickly became evident, especially in the property sector.
Sentiment was also given a big fillip by another sharp rise in Glaxo shares
as the market continued to react to news that the US authorities had
extended the US patent on the UK drug company's anti-ulcer drug Zantac for a
further two years.
The 100 index moved into plus territory within an hour of the opening and
thereafter improved to post a 10-point rise in mid-morning before turning
off again during the early afternoon.
With Wall Street embarking on its strong rise in the late afternoon, the
FT-SE 100 eventually closed at the day's best.
The Halifax Building Society's move to cut building insurance premiums by 20
per cent was seen as the first attempt by the building societies to head off
a move into buildings insurance by Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland
subsidiary.

FT  22 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading

<TEXT>
Stock index futures made further progress and in late, screen-based trading
the FT-SE 100 March contract climbed back above the 3,100 level, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
Activity remained nominal, with the March contract notching up just 2,939
lots during pit trading and only slightly topping 6,500 when screen trading
finally came to an end.
At the official close, the March contract stood at 3,093, up eight points,
taking its advance over the past four sessions to 100 points. The premium to
the cash market was 28 points, or five points above fair value.
Traders said the market had just about given up for the year. In contrast,
stock options provided an abundance of features, with a number of big
volumes showing through as December options expired, and Glaxo and HSBC
(both January options) meeting with some heavy, genuine two-way business.
Spurred by position-closing and rollovers as December options came to an
end, British Gas, Barclays and Abbey National were the three most active
options. British Gas clocked up 4,225 lots. Among January options, Glaxo saw
2,803 and HSBC 1,002.
Total volume was 41,589 - up from 29,443 on Tuesday - with calls accounting
for 24,752 and puts 16,837. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume was almost 28,000
lots.

FT  22 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Mexico leads Latam plunge as
Dow climbs

Wall Street
The US market showed potential for a year-end rally yesterday as equity
prices climbed above 3,800 on the Dow indicator for the first time since
November 18, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 50 points during the day
before falling back to close 34.65 up at 3,801.80. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 2.51 to 459.61, the American Stock Exchange
composite increased by 2.63 to 427.93 and the Nasdaq composite gained 8.61
at 737.12. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 380.5m shares.
With yesterday's gains, the Dow has now made up most of the ground lost by a
sharp sell-off in late-November. On November 22 the Dow plunged 91 points
amid investor fears that the Federal Reserve, which had raised interest
rates on November 15, would boost rates again in December.
Many on Wall Street had come to believe that there would be no traditional
year-end uptick because of all the insecurity about interest rates. With
chances of another rate increase this year low, investors yesterday were
watching to see if the day's advance could turn into a full-blown rally.
Cyclical stocks jumped with the market, the Morgan Stanley cyclical index
adding 1.4 per cent. Mead rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 and Tenneco
Dollars 1 to Dollars 43 1/8 .
ADRs of Mexican companies dropped in the wake of Tuesday's devaluation of
the peso, which caused a sharp fall in Mexico's bolsa. Bellwether stock
Telefonos de Mexico lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 45 and Grupo Tribasa fell
Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 22 3/8 .
Elsewhere, Biogen forged ahead Dollars 6 5/8 or 18.6 per cent to Dollars 42
1/4 on rumours that the biotech company may be the subject of a takeover
bid. Cigna tumbled Dollars 4 7/8 or 7.3 per cent to Dollars 61 7/8 after AM
Best lowered the insurance company's credit rating.
Aluminum Company of America put on Dollars 2 at Dollars 82 3/4 after the
company said it expected a gain of about Dollars 295m for the fourth quarter
of this year after a loss of nearly Dollars 87m for the last quarter of
1993.
Intel, up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 62 5/8 , continued to gain from its
announcement that it would replace flawed Pentium chips on demand. The
shares had been under pressure because of negative publicity surrounding the
chip's flaw. Shares in computer makers that use the Pentium chip were mixed.
Canada
Toronto enjoyed a third day of solid gains, but the upward trend stirred
fears that the market was reaching its short term high.
The TSE 300 composite index added 21.49 at 4,175.62, while turnover was the
fourth heaviest on record, reaching 97m shares valued at CDollars 921m.
Rises led falls by 460 to 369.
Mexico
Mexican stocks went into freefall as investors were taken by surprise by the
255 basis-point rise in local interest rates to 16 per cent. However, the
market ended well above the day's worst on bargain hunting with a decline of
3.1 per cent on the IPC index, having initially plunged 11.7 per cent. The
IPC lost a net 70.50 at 2,203.67. Volume totalled a fairly heavy 119.4m
shares.
The rate move followed a 15 per cent devaluation of the peso on Tuesday,
which had been triggered by the outflow of capital, particularly from US and
European investors, as a result of violence in the southern state of
Chiapas.
Investors were now worried that the government might be forced to make a
second devaluation, commented analysts in London.
However, Mr Nigel Rendell, emerging markets strategist at James Capel,
remained positive on the market, assuming there was no further devaluation.
He argued that while the initial consequences of devaluation for some
companies would be negative, over a longer time period the negatives should
be outweighed by positives, namely export growth and, hopefully, lower
interest rates; while companies with substantial dollar earnings should
outperform.
Mr Roger Palmer, director of emerging markets at Kleinwort Benson, took a
similar line, and suspected that the market was going through a storm which
would gradually subside. He now saw company earnings growth between 30 to 40
per cent in 1995.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo plummeted 6.4 per cent in reaction to the news from
Mexico. The Bovespa index closed 3,038 off at 44,952. Volume was RDollars
364m.
A broker said the mood on Brazil's markets suffered further yesterday from
rumours that two large and reputable brokerage houses could be close to
collapse.
Argentina
In Buenos Aires the Merval index finished 29.65 or 5.7 per cent down at
486.70 on worries about the fallout from Tuesday's devaluation of the peso.
Volumes increased amid the sell-off. Turnover on the open outcry market
totalled a strong 41.3m pesos.

FT  22 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Kuala Lumpur strong as
Nikkei falls back

<TEXT>
Profit-taking by traders and domestic institutions left the Nikkei 225
average lower, in spite of arbitrage linked buying in the morning session,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index lost 66.31 at 19,340.67 after a day's high of 19,454.79 and low of
19,277.26. Arbitrage buying countered early morning profit-taking, but
large-lot sales by domestic institutions finally prompted a decline in the
index.
Volume was 282m shares, against 293m. The Topix index of all first section
stocks dipped 2.89 to 1,522.01 and the Nikkei 300 eased 0.90 to 280.86.
Losers led gainers by 534 to 465, with 195 issues unchanged. In London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 2.52 to 1,265.25.
Traders said corporate profit-taking, to realise profits ahead of the March
year-end, would continue. While public postal insurance and state pension
funds supported shares against the prospect of a sharp fall during October
and November, analysts expect such purchases to wane during the second half
to March. 'The funds probably have not much over Y500bn left available for
investment within this fiscal year,' commented Mr Jason James at James
Capel.
Some dealers expected that, in order to generate funds, public fund managers
would take profits when the index rose. 'It could mean more selling pressure
ahead of the March year-end,' said a Japanese brokerage official.
Individual investors traded in the second section and over-the-counter
market. The second section index, however declined 7.20 to 2,066.01.
High-technology issues, bought recently on the 'multimedia' theme, retreated
on profit-taking. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y960 and Sony Y20 to Y5,530.
Japan Tobacco rose Y12,000 to Y936,000 on buying by overseas investors and
banks. Traders said many investors felt that profit-taking in the stock had
run its course.
Drugs companies, which had been bought by investors attracted by low
valuations, receded on profit-taking. Tanabe Seiyaku shed Y31 to Y789 and
Taisho Pharmaceutical Y40 to Y1,810.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 50.18 to 21,096.03 in volume of 136.8m
shares. Turnover ballooned due to cross-trading, or selling and buying back
of shares by the same investor.
Roundup
A number of factors influenced the region's trading yesterday.
KUALA LUMPUR extended the week's strong climb, the composite index adding
15.98 or 1.7 per cent at 982.17, helped by gains in key blue chip stocks.
The index has risen 3.7 per cent since Monday morning. Dealers said some of
the buying was linked to renewed talk that the government might call a
general election early next year instead of waiting until October.
SEOUL saw a technical rally after recent losses, with broad gains seen among
smaller-capitalised shares. The composite index firmed 2.86 to 1,026.85.
Samsung Electronics gained Won2,500 at Won109,500 on the belief that the
share price had now bottomed, while the company's plan to buy back its own
shares also bolstered investor sentiment.
HONG KONG encountered some late selective buying which overcame early
profit-taking, although trade was relatively slow as many major investors
had already closed their books for the holidays.
The Hang Seng index was finally ahead 64.23 at 8,331.56, after a day's low
of 8,230.32, in turnover of HKDollars 2.8bn.
TAIPEI moved higher on bargain hunting in strong industrials. The weighted
index rose 85.32 or 1.2 per cent to 7,010.60 and turnover was heavy at
TDollars 102bn.
Brokers remarked that the release of November export orders helped to
strengthen investor optimism.
Textiles were the main gainers, Hualon rising by the daily 7 per cent limit
to TDollars 38.30 and Chung Shing TDollars 1.40 to TDollars 22.80.
MANILA surged following the US Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest
rates steady. The composite index advanced 50.55 to 2,790.59. All sectors
posted rises, with commercial-industrial stocks leading the way and adding
60.12 at 4,097.29.
SYDNEY closed higher in subdued pre-Christmas trading, boosted by a stronger
golds sector. The All Ordinaries index rose 6.9 to 1,905.5, while the golds
group moved ahead 27.8 or 1.5 per cent to 1,867.0. Volume was 158m shares
worth ADollars 525m.
BOMBAY held firm in low volume on late buying by local funds, combined with
purchases by jobbers covering their year-end short positions. The BSE-30
index edged 15.05 higher to 3,912.63.
SINGAPORE was relieved that the Federal Reserve had not acted to increase US
interest rates and the Straits Times Industrial index jumped 34.02 to
2,217.48 in improved volume of 136m shares.

The Indian equity market rates a cautious assessment by Nomura Securities,
writes John Pitt. Noting that the BSE 30-share index has fallen by some 16
per cent since registering an all-time high of 4,630 in September, Ms Alison
Southey, a Nomura strategist, says 'a mixture of political, economic and
international influences are combining to undermine the market, and we see
no quick relief from this malaise'.
At issue, she continues, is how the government will deliver the next steps
in the reform process 'without putting upward pressure on inflation and/or
the budget deficit, both of which turned out worse than expected this year'.
The political background remains uncertain, with local elections due soon
and the general election scheduled for 1996. This being the case, the focus
of economic policy management could become 'dangerously short term', says Ms
Southey. As a consequence, 'there is a danger that the Asian style
'take-off', with high growth and low inflation, may still be a distant
dream'.

FT  22 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): US revival underpins bourse
recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The absence of a US interest rate rise, even with a subsequent fall in the
Dow overnight, seemed to lay the foundations of yesterday's bourse recovery,
writes Our Markets Staff. In the afternoon, Wall Street's revival took the
process further.
FRANKFURT looked tentative on the session with a Dax index rise of 6.73 to
2,086.66; but at the end of the afternoon the Ibis-indicated Dax was 15.34
higher at 2,095.50.
Turnover eased from DM4.5bn to DM4.4bn. Chemicals led shares upward, Bayer
ending the afternoon DM8 higher at DM361.50, and Hoechst rising even faster
with a gain of DM8.40 to DM828. There was talk of small fund buying of the
sector and, late in the day, of Hoechst's planned price rises for technical
fibres.
Mr Shaw Bridges, European chemicals specialist at Merrill Lynch in London,
said that the industry had seen good increases in physical sales volume, and
was now moving into a period of better pricing. Hoechst had experienced
disappointing profit margins for a long time; it had also been relatively
late in restructuring its operations, with the cost-cutting that this
entailed, but analysts now seemed to believe that the process was well under
way.
PARIS caught the tail of Wall Street's opening rally and the CAC-40 index
accelerated 16.17 to 1,940.89.
Smith New Court put a buy note out on Valeo, up FFr8.50 at FFr248.50, and
made a case for the car components manufacturer's being the target of a
takeover bid. It argued that:
the company was relatively small;
its major shareholder, the holding company, Cerus, remained in bad financial
shape and 'would not be in a position to defend Valeo if a raider attacked';
the company would be net cash positive by the end of next year, and by 1996
the cash pile could amount to more than FFr3bn. 'Clearly, the cash could be
attractive to a raider,' added the broker.
Bollore Technologies, the diversified industrial group, added FFr7.80 to
FFr447.00 as it confirmed reports that it was negotiating the sale of 11
ships for around FFr800m. If successful, the sale would cut the group's debt
to some FFr4bn.
MILAN stood aloof from the drama unfolding in parliament and the market
continued to rally for a sixth consecutive day, with the weak lira again
providing the catalyst for foreign equity investors. The Comit index rose
11.15 or 1.8 per cent to L624.06 on the view that, one way or another, the
government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi was about to fall.
The index has bounced by 7.4 per cent from its year's low on December 13.
Foreign investors have been attracted by expectations that the government
would be replaced by a so-called institutional government, headed by a
non-partisan prime minister from outside parliament, which would quickly
bring an end to the political uncertainty.
Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa in Milan, warned, however that foreign
markets were probably over-optimistic about how quickly an institutional
government might be formed. He added that domestic investors thought that
fresh elections were more likely.
Among blue chips, Fiat rose L125 or 2.1 per cent to L5,974 as the company
reiterated that it had recorded 'an extraordinary turnaround' in 1994.
Stet rose L123 to L4,563 after announcing that consolidated net profit for
1994 would be around L2,000bn, up from L1,530bn last year.
ZURICH saw the SMI index 21.4 higher at 2,636.1 in relatively active
trading. Roche certificates extended Tuesday's solid gain, closing SFr110
higher at SFr6,300, benefiting from the relatively strong dollar.
Among second liners, Ems-Chemie rose SFr100 to SFr3,930 as SBC issued
warrants on the share.
MADRID's equity market mirrored weakness in the peseta and in domestic
bonds, shaken by a further high level arrest in connection with vigilante
attacks on the Basque separatist group, Eta. The general index fell another
1.87 to 291.59, threatening the 1994 low of 288.65.
Some relief from the gloom came from the planned introduction to the Ibex-35
index of leading stocks, from January 2, of the paper group, Empresa
Nacional de Celulosa (Ence), and the fashion retailer, Cortefiel, whose
shares rose Pta30 to Pta3,195 and Pta40 to Pta3,995 respectively. But the
departing stocks, Aguas de Barcelona and the builder, Huarte, fell by more
than the newcomers rose, with drops of Pta75 to Pta2,465 and Pta30 to
Pta1,330.
AMSTERDAM moved firmly ahead although trading activity remained relatively
muted. The AEX index added 2.71 to 413.35, just below its session best.
VNU, up Fl 2.70 at Fl 178.80, announced after the close of business that it
was acquiring a UK information company, Calyx.
Among the multinationals there was a gain of Fl 3.30 in Unilever to Fl
202.20 as investors applauded its recent reorganisation announcement.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Lira recovers as political crisis nears
climax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lira bounced off recent lows yesterday, with markets apparently taking
the view that the worst was now over in Italy, writes Philip Gawith.
Although the political outlook remains extremely murky, investors are taking
heart from the fact that the current period of political instability is
nearing a close.
The lira closed in London at L1,045 per D-Mark, from L1,049. Earlier it had
reached a high in Europe of L1,043.
Elsewhere, the French franc hit its lowest level against the D-Mark since
December 1, 1993. It ended at FFr3.454, from FFr3.451, as rumours about
President Mitterrand's health, and continued political uncertainty, bothered
traders.
Those currency moves which took place were exaggerated by thin trading
conditions.
The decision by the FOMC to leave US interest rates on hold elicited
negligible market response. The dollar traded in extremely narrow ranges to
finish at DM1.5703 and Y100.17, from Tuesday's closes of DM1.5720 and Y100.3
before the FOMC announcement. But in New York the currency firmed to end at
DM1.5805 and Y100.47.
In Mexico, the peso continued its downward slide after the 15 per cent
devaluation on Tuesday. It closed at 3.987 pesos to the dollar, from 3.885.
Sterling had a quiet day, finishing at DM2.4527, from DM2.4491.
Today the focus is on the meeting of the Bundesbank council. No change in
rates is expected, but the announcement of the target range for M3 growth in
1995 will be closely watched.
The key features of Mr Berlusconi's address to parliament were that the
existing coalition is dead, and fresh elections are inevitable.
Analysts said the bounce back in the lira could be attributed to traders,
with short lira positions, taking profits.
Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers in London,
said an early election would probably be the worst outcome from a markets
perspective.
With elections unlikely to be held during winter, it could be as long as May
before a new government was installed. The lack of government in the interim
would unsettle financial markets.
This need not be all gloom and doom. Mr Brian Durrant, economist at broker
GNI, points out that in the second quarter of 1993 a consensus non-political
figure head (Amato) presided over a 10 per cent rise in the lira against the
D-Mark. By contrast, the lira has fallen by around 10 per cent since April
12, two weeks after Mr Berlusconi took office.
Rumours that President Mitterrand would be stopping chemo-therapy treatment
caused concern, with some observers believing it could advance the election
timetable.
Another factor worrying investors is the possibility that German interest
rates will rise. If the Bank of France fails to follow suit immediately, the
franc could suffer. Political risk is also becoming an increasingly
important factor with the franc as the presidential elections draw near.
Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said
fears of the public debate 'lurching towards Euro-scepticism', now that Mr
Jacques Delors had withdrawn, were overdone.
He said it was 'far from obvious that a Chirac victory would mean a
permanently weaker currency'. He predicted a downside of FFr3.50 against the
D-Mark.
In the more likely event of victory for the current prime minister, Mr
Edouard Balladur, Mr Jessop forecasts the franc appreciating towards FFr3.38
by the end of 1995.
Helped by the bullish tone of US financial markets, there was a late rally
in short sterling. The March contract traded around 24,000 lots, to end 10
basis points up at 92.70.
Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, commented: 'There
have been a lot of stories about tough trading conditions, with retailers
putting their hopes on a last minute surge in sales. If that fails to
materialise, prospects of an early rise in UK rates look misplaced.'
In its daily operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 950m shortage,
the bulk of it with late assistance. Mr Parsons said this could reflect
clearing banks holding back bills in an attempt to push up short-dated
lending rates ahead of a five-day holiday period. The Bank eased liquidity
conditions by injecting Pounds 1.73bn into the market through its repo
facility.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks on nutmeg pact break down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's two major nutmeg producers have suspended negotiations on a new
joint marketing agreement amid concerns about the involvement of a European
marketing company and will resume their discussions in March.
Indonesia and Grenada, which account for 75 per cent and 23 per cent,
respectively, of world nutmeg production, have been seeking a marketing
agreement to stabilise world prices for the spice.
Grenadian producers have objected to the involvement in the talks of
BerCatz, a marketing company, which would get a 5 per cent commission on
sales under the agreement with the producers.
'The Grenada Co-operative Nutmeg Association is totally opposed to any joint
marketing arrangement which gives BerCatz a percentage, simply because the
company is not a producer,' said Mr Cliff Robertson, chairman of the
association.
Grenadian producers would back a new agreement only if it was between
producers of Grenada and Indonesia, as this was the only way to achieve a
higher price for the commodity on the international market, he said.
Producers in the two countries have been trying to agree on a protocol to
stabilise and then to increase world market prices but have steered clear of
recreating their cartel, which collapsed six years ago following the
liberalisation of the industry in Indonesia. While not planning to set
prices, the producers want to co-operate in monitoring the volume of the
spice offered for sale on the world market.
Before the talks were suspended, producers in both countries were discussing
proposals to keep supply at about 9,500 tonnes per year, marginally less
than current world demand and 2,500 tonnes less than the current combined
production of both countries.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: End seen to bull run in base
metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The present bull market in base metals will probably end in the third
quarter of 1995, according to analysts at the Merrill Lynch financial
services group.
However, before the downturn, 'the bull run from January to July 1995 could
be very exciting indeed,' it is suggested in Merrill's latest monthly base
and precious metals report. Mr Ted Arnold, metals analyst, and Mr Stephen
Waite, senior European economist say: 'The strong price gains that have been
seen in 1994 are not likely to be experienced after the end of the second
quarter of 1995. But that is not the same as saying that the average price
trends will collapse.
'We think the rocket-like price trajectories of most base metals will
flatten out and begin to turn lower in the latter half of 1995.'
Some selected metals, such as nickel - used intensively in the production of
capital goods - may be able to show a rising price and rising average price
trend for another year or so after the bull phase has ended.
The authors point out that bull markets in metals rarely last for more than
18 to 24 months primarily because new production capacity is encouraged to
start up or existing mines are expanded.
Also high prices sometimes encourage 'a big response from the scrap sector'.
In addition some demand is lost because metal users in the face of sharply
rising prices switch at the margin to other products or processes. The
exception is that copper is virtually price inelastic as it is essential for
copper wiring and the cost of metal used is a very small component of total
prices of products.
The authors also point out that bull markets end because interest rates rise
with economic activity and at some point become high enough to choke off
demand at the margin and slow down activity. That is usually when a period
of stock liquidation begins. However, miners and aluminium smelters continue
to maximise production to reduce unit costs and so stocks of surplus metal
start to build up again on the London Metal Exchange.
One feature of the present bull market has been the involvement of the hedge
and commodity funds who have been buying in anticipation of higher metals
prices. The authors warn that the funds are likely to anticipate the time
when consumption will start to slow down and production starts to satisfy
current demand. 'Our guess is that when that happens the funds will go as
aggressively short as they went aggressively long earlier this year. When
they start to sell short and get out of their long positions, relatively
high stock levels in most metals will reinforce the market's bearishness.'

FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: St Lucia's strike-breaking
banana growers to get police protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON, JAMAICA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The St Lucian government is to provide police protection for banana farmers
whose storage sheds are being burnt and some of their fruit indiscriminately
cut because they are refusing to join a farmers' strike.
Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia, the leading banana exporter
in the Windward Islands, which provide most of Britain's bananas, said the
strikers wanted to destroy the island's banana industry.
The three-week stoppage was called by the Banana Salvation Committee, which
has been calling in vain for an extra-ordinary meeting of the St Lucia
Banana Growers' Association to discuss the restructuring of the industry.
The fruit and sheds of many farmers refusing to join the strike have been
vandalised. 'This will be stopped,' said Mr Compton. The police have been
investigating several cases of arson on banana farms.
'This definitely cannot continue,' the prime minister said. 'Farmers who
sweat and slave in the heat of the day to promote the fuel that drives our
economy, cannot have their efforts destroyed by criminal gangs who work in
the dead of night, under the cover of darkness.'
The prime minister said that the attacks on the farmers not joining the
strike were not hampering the export of bananas from St Lucia.
Despite the destruction of the storage sheds, almost all the fruit that was
ready was harvested last week, when exports reached 1,900 tonnes, the
highest weekly total since a tropical storm devastated most of the island's
farms earlier this year.
St Lucia's banana industry was hit hardest when the storm struck the
Windwards in early September, losing an estimated 70,000 tonnes, or 68 per
cent of the expected crop.
The island's banana growers would be involved in the management of the
industry, but not until the growers' association's finances were 'restored
to good health,' the prime minister said.
The relative lack of involvement of growers in the management of the
industry is troubling farmers in the other Windward islands of Dominica,
Grenada and St Vincent. The Windward Islands Farmers' Association is
discussing a series of proposals to change this, according to industry
officials.
They say, however, that some of the proposals for changes have implications
for the Windward Island governments' access to funds from Stabex, the
European Union's compensatory finance mechanism for African, Caribbean and
Pacific states which suffer crop losses from natural disasters.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian platinum sales 'up 41
per cent' in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imports of Russian platinum to the main western markets in 1994 are likely
to be the second-highest on record at about 1.12m troy ounces, according to
the CRU International consultancy group. This would be 41 per cent up from
last year.
'This raises again the question of the real picture for Russian production,
stocks and sales,' says Mr Tony Warwick-Ching, in CRU's Precious Metals
Monitor.
As production is clearly facing fresh problems because of the accident at
the Norilsk complex - which supplies most of Russia's platinum group metals
 -at the end of November, stock levels are increasingly important.
'The problem is that no-one seems to have a clear idea of what the Russians
have in stock,' Mr Warwick-Ching points out.
The Monitor shows that in the first ten months of 1994 Swiss imports of
Russian platinum were 48 per cent higher than in the same period of 1993 at
297,000 ounces while, at 591,000 ounces, Japan's imports were 51 per cent
up. 'Reported Russian deliveries to Germany, the US, Japan and Switzerland
in the first nine months of the year have totalled over 820,000 ounces,
already exceeding the figure for the whole of 1993.'
Mr Warwick-Ching says the strength of Japanese demand 'remains puzzling'.
Production of cars - big consumers of platinum in anti-pollution catalysts -
in Japan is down by 10.7 per cent. However, platinum jewellery sales are
robust because, while the dollar price of platinum has risen by 6.4 per cent
since January, in yen terms it has fallen 6.2 per cent.
He suggests the failure of the platinum price to react to 'the more bullish
market perception of its fundamentals' is because of the tendency of some
market players to link it closely to gold and silver in their
computer-driven trading operations. CRU expects the price to remain above
Dollars 400 but says it 'remains vulnerable to speculator sell-offs in the
other precious metals.'

FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP wins 7 per cent iron ore
price rise

Broken Hill Proprietary, one of Australia's biggest iron ore producers, has
secured an average 7 per cent price rise for 1995-96 in the annual round of
contract negotiations with Japanese steel mill buyers.
This reverses the trend of declining prices seen in the previous three
years, although the extent of the rise - which is calculated on a US dollar
basis - is mitigated by the strengthening of the Australian dollar over the
past 12 months.
The annual contract negotiations between the Australian suppliers and the
Japanese buyers play a key role in setting prices internationally. Australia
is the world's fourth largest supplier of iron ore, after China, Brazil, and
the former Soviet Union, while the Japanese steel mills source about half
their raw material from the country. Iron ore is Australia's fifth largest
export, earning around ADollars 3bn a year.
The outcome of the latest round of negotiations, which began in Tokyo last
month, was announced by BHP's iron ore division yesterday. It said a price
of 21.15 US cents a dry long ton unit for Mt Newman fines, and 35.89 cents
for Mt Newman lump ore, had been agreed, representing rises of 5.8 per cent
and 7.9 per cent over current contract price.
The differential between the prices for lump and fines was a record and
reflected strong demand for lump ore, the company added.
BHP described the settlement as 'satisfactory, given that the Japanese steel
mills are in the early stages of a recovery to profitability after a
harrowing recession'. The average 7 per cent rise is slightly bigger than
analysts had forecast and BHP shares rose 22 cents to ADollars 19.48 on the
news.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strike threat heightens turmoil
in pulp market
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unions at three British Columbian pulp and paper mills owned by Fletcher
Challenge Canada have threatened to strike from tomorrow after withdrawing
from mediation on a new labour contract. The spectre of a strike is one of
several developments that have thrown world pulp and paper markets into a
near-frenzy.
Further price increases for pulp and various grades of paper appear to be in
the offing.
Some North American newsprint producers are rumoured to be considering
another price increase in addition to the 9 per cent rise scheduled for
March. Prices for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp are due to rise by
USDollars 50 to Dollars 750 a tonne on January 1. Another increase early in
the New Year would come as no surprise.
Mr Rodney Young, president of Resource Information Systems, a US
consultancy, predicted yesterday that the first half of 1995 would see 'a
very, very strong market for pulp and paper in general'.
However, analysts expect that markets will cool later in the year, as US
economic growth slows and new pulp and paper capacity comes on stream,
especially in Indonesia and North America.
Factors pushing up demand include strong consumption in south-east Asia, and
moves by European and North American paper users to build up stocks.
Besides the strike threat in BC, markets have also been unsettled by
protracted labour negotiations in the Finnish forestry industry. Finnish
employers and unions are scheduled to meet again tomorrow to try to settle
their differences.
Views differ on whether either the BC or Finnish labour disputes will result
in a sustained disruption of supplies.
Fletcher Challenge said yesterday that progress had been made in its talks
but the two sides remained divided on some key issues, including employer
demands for more flexible work practices and contracting-out of work to
non-union labour.
The pattern set by Fletcher Challenge is likely to be followed by other BC
pulp and paper producers.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Italy rallies despite political
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian government bonds rallied yesterday, in spite of continuing political
uncertainty.
The March bond futures contract on Liffe climbed by 0.62 to reach 99.52,
while in the cash market the yield spread over bunds narrowed by 11 basis
points to 477. The uplift was due to short covering by domestic traders,
said analysts.
In spite of a combative defence of his government by prime minister Mr
Silvio Berlusconi yesterday, the markets still see a new administration as
inevitable. 'All the bad news has been factored in,' said Mr Adrian James,
European bond strategist at NatWest Markets.
In the longer term, overseas investors are likely to remain underweight
until more effective action is taken to tackle fiscal problems.
Although some analysts say technical resistance will prevent the yield
spread widening above 500 basis points over the bund, this view is not
shared by all observers.
Mr Giorgio Radaelli, senior economist with Lehman Brothers International,
says early elections - conducted under present constitutional arrangements -
would be the worst outcome, prolonging political uncertainty. German bonds
ended a quiet session broadly unchanged, with the March bund futures
contract on Liffe ending around 89.70, up 0.01 point.
Most dealers were not expecting any surprise announcements from today's
meeting of the Bundesbank's central bank council. The central bank is due to
announce its M3 money supply growth target for next year, and most dealers
expect it to stick to its current 4-6 per cent range.
UK gilts ended a slow day little changed, though slightly outperforming
Germany which caused the 10-year yield gap over bunds to narrow by two basis
points to 112 basis points. Volume was thin and dealers reported little
activity.
French bonds continued their recent weakness, led again by the short end of
the yield curve as the French franc continued to weaken against the D-Mark.
With the franc trading outside its former narrow exchange rate mechanism
band, dealers are wondering what the central bank will do to defend the
currency.
Spanish bonds came under pressure from currency weakness, political troubles
and fears that the Bank of Spain - which gains full policy independence next
year - will raise rates sooner than previously expected. The Spanish 10-year
bond future fell by 0.23 point to 84.91.
US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after moderate demand at an
afternoon auction of two-year notes.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 96
1/16 yielding 7.837 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/16 at 99 13/16 , yielding 7.563 per cent.
The modest decrease at the short end of the market was due in part to
traders short selling those securities amid speculation that prices - which
have bounced back this week from their lows earlier this month - would drop
with another monetary tightening.
The Federal Reserve's failure to raise rates at Tuesday's meeting of its
open market committee lifted the prices at the short end, causing the curve
mapping the relation of yields on two-year and 30-year bonds to steepen
despite an overall flattening trend. A flattening curve generally indicates
that the market expects an economic slowdown.
Few economists, however expected the steepness to hold because of the
widespread belief that the Fed will raise interest rates again shortly after
the start of the new year.
Modest but not overwhelming demand was shown at an afternoon auction in
which the Treasury sold Dollars 17.25bn of two-year notes. This afternoon
the Treasury is to offer Dollars 11bn in five-year notes.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Syndicated Loans: Swedish deal increased to Dollars 6bn
after strong response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A jumbo syndicated loan for Sweden has been increased to Dollars 6bn from
Dollars 5bn after a strong response from international banks.
The deal, arranged by Citibank and JP Morgan, is notable for its low pricing
and is likely to set a benchmark for sovereign borrowers in the
international credits market.
The revolving loan has a facility fee of 4 basis points plus a cost if drawn
of 4 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor), making a
total of 8 basis points over Libor.
The loan replaces two existing and more expensive credits which mature in
1995.
Ms Christine Holm, director of the Swedish National Debt Office, said around
Dollars 1bn was outstanding of the two loans maturing next year and the
remainder of the new loan would be kept in reserve.
She said: 'We are very happy with this facility. It has been a very good
exercise for us.'
The cost of international bank loans has fallen by almost half this year.
Banks have become more competitive as they seek new assets while corporate
borrowers have been reluctant to take on debt. This competition has resulted
in an increase in activity as well as a tendency for loans to
highly-respected credits to be oversubscribed.
A total of 27 banks offered to underwrite Dollars 8bn for the Sweden deal,
and a further 19 banks joined in syndication for the loan, which is due to
be signed on January 9.
In November, Sweden voted to join the European Union and bankers involved in
the jumbo loan are planning a trip from London to Brussels via Eurostar, the
Channel tunnel train, for a celebratory dinner.
Portugal plans a large external loan, between Dollars 100m and Dollars 500m,
in the first quarter of 1995, a senior Treasury source said, Reuter reports
from Lisbon.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Bonds: SEK launches Dollars 100m zero-coupon
offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another slow day in the eurobond market was enlivened by just one deal
yesterday, a Dollars 100m offering of two-year bonds by Swedish Export
Credit (SEK).
The zero-coupon issue, which offers a pick-up in yield of about 500 basis
points above two-year yen deposit rates, will be placed entirely with
Japanese retail investors, lead manager Daiwa said.
SEK, a frequent borrower which has raised about Dollars 5bn this year on
international markets, launched an almost identical deal at the end of
October.
Italy, Finland and the Canadian province of Ontario are reported to be
looking at the five-year dollar sector. Finland has also been linked with a
long-dated sterling deal.
Kansai Electric Power is rumoured to be considering a dollar deal via
Merrill Lynch. Current favourable swap levels mean that other Japanese
electric power companies are likely to follow, said one trader.
A number of borrowers are reported to be looking at the yen sector, where
demand - especially from the life insurance companies - remains strong. The
European Investment Bank is reported to be considering a six- to 10-year
offering of at least Y100bn.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Private-sector initiatives
for swaps taking shape - Laurie Morse examines two schemes in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The push to make the private bank market in swaps and other derivatives more
transparent and easily tracked is gaining momentum in the US, where the
Federal Reserve has openly advocated a swaps clearing house, and where two
private-sector initiatives are taking shape.
Those initiatives, being undertaken separately by the Chicago Board of Trade
(CBoT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), promise to blur further
the lines between the standard definitions of commodities, securities and
banking activities.
The most ambitious of the proposals, a two-year-old initiative by the CBoT,
is still held up in a controversial filing at the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the exchange's chief regulator. The CBoT is proposing a
centralised body that would guarantee the private trades of member dealers,
limiting the systemic credit risks inherent in the over-the-counter market.
The biggest swaps dealers are lukewarm towards the CBoT proposal, because
they rely on their top-quality credit ratings to bring them the lion's share
of the world's derivatives dealings.
A clearing house that would guarantee the credit quality of all trades - the
cornerstone of listed derivatives markets - would eliminate the dealers'
credit advantage.
The CBoT last week modified its proposal to the CFTC. The modifications
would still involve the CBoT in clearing as well as valuing swaps
transactions. The agency is likely to require many more revisions before the
CBoT initiative can progress.
Two weeks ago the CME said it would open a swaps collateral depository that
would serve some valuation and global custody needs of the OTC derivatives
market, but would stop short of guaranteeing trades.
Explaining the decision not to clear swaps trades, Mr Jack Sandner, the
CME's chairman, said: 'The big dealers like JP Morgan and Bankers Trust are
our biggest (futures market) customers. They bring us a lot of business and
we don't want them to think we're competing with them. The idea of a (swaps)
clearing house would be embraced wholeheartedly by the smaller players, but
we've decided it is not up to us to level that playing field.'
Mindful of the obstacle the CBoT has encountered at the CFTC, the CME is
planning to snub its chief regulator. It hopes to set up its global custody
facility as a trust company, independent of the exchange, and is seeking
regulatory oversight from the US Federal Reserve.
Avoiding CFTC regulation for the swaps custody operation is crucial to its
success, CME insiders say. They fear none of the big swaps dealers will come
to the table if they are required to report to the CFTC, as well as banking
and securities regulators.
CME officials claim that a non-clearing swaps custody operation can be
unregulated. However, they are seeking the Fed's imprimatur to give the
facility international credibility. Privately, they also say that if they
were successful with the swaps custody business, it would be a small jump
into clearing. 'At that stage, we'd want the Fed as regulator,' says one CME
official.
The CME facility will be for dealer-to-dealer transactions only, and will
not serve end-users.
The technical considerations in consolidating the valuation and
collateralisation of OTC derivatives trades, let alone clearing them, are
daunting. Although both futures exchanges have long histories of
guaranteeing listed derivatives and handling the vast amounts of collateral,
over-the-counter trades have far more variables, and are much less easily
accounted for.
Furthermore, dealers already have sophisticated bilateral systems for
tracking collateral and valuing trades and their concurrent risk exposures.
To be successful, the exchange efforts would have to be less expensive than
those existing systems. The CME and CBoT plans are aimed predominantly at
interest rate swaps.
Since derivative dealers must have custody arrangements for their entire
portfolio, this one-product approach might make the facilities less
attractive, industry sources say.
On the other hand, 'there is no question there are opportunities for
economies of scale' in a centralised swaps-tracking facility,' says one
trader for a large dealer. Some of those economies are controversial, and
are being discussed gingerly by the exchanges.
One of these, cross-margining, would allow interest rate exposures on
exchange-traded futures to be netted against swaps exposures tracked by the
derivatives clearing house. If allowed, it would vastly reduce bank capital
requirements, and be a powerful incentive for dealers to participate in a
centralised facility.

Tele-Communications Inc, the leading US cable television service provider,
has acquired a stake in The Microsoft Network, a computer on-line service
that Microsoft, the world's largest software company, plans to launch next
year.
For Dollars 125m in TCI stock, the cable group has acquired a 20 per cent
stake in the newly formed Microsoft Online Services Partnership, a general
partnership formed to develop and market Microsoft's on-line services.
Microsoft currently holds the remaining 80 per cent.
The partnership between Microsoft and TCI reflects the convergence of
computer, communications and entertainment technologies which is expected to
result in broadband on-line services within the next few years.
Such services, delivered via high-speed communications lines, will be
capable of offering interactive multimedia information, including video and
sophisticated graphics. This is in contrast to today's on-line services,
which are largely limited to text and simple graphics.
'As we build our broadband networks, this partnership will give us the
ability to offer the Microsoft Network as a high-speed, interactive on-line
service,' said Mr Bruce Ravenel, senior vice-president of TCI Technology
Ventures, a division of TCI.
Microsoft said the development of 'cable modems' - devices that link a
personal computer to a TV cable network - would lift demand for on-line
services and enable information providers such as news organisations and
other publishers to gradually migrate their on-line service offerings to
more sophisticated broadband services.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: BTR Nylex in ADollars 800m
Formica purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BTR Nylex, the Australian arm of BTR, the UK conglomerate, announced
yesterday that it is acquiring FM Holdings, the parent company of Formica
Corp, the US laminates group, for ADollars 800m (USDollars 620m).
FM Holdings, based in New Jersey, is the world's largest producer of
high-pressure decorative laminates. It manufactures under the brand names of
Formica and Sureil, and has 11 manufacturing sites in the US, UK, Canada,
France, Spain, Germany and Taiwan. It employs about 3,400 people.
Under the terms of the deal, BTR would assume Formica's borrowings with the
balance payable for 100 per cent of the company's shares in cash, BTR said.
Formica's borrowings as of September 1994 were about ADollars 440m
equivalent. Gross assets at the same date were about ADollars 485m, leaving
net assets of ADollars 45m, according to BTR.
For calendar year 1993, Formica's total sales were ADollars 580m with
operating profits of ADollars 45m. Interest charges for that year stood at
ADollars 62m and after-tax losses were ADollars 5m, BTR said.
'Full completion of the merger is expected in January 1995,' BTR said.
'Major shareholders and top management, representing approximately 90 per
cent of the total equity of FM Holdings have approved the terms of the
merger and therefore the merger is effectively unconditional as at this
date,' it added.
BTR chairman Mr Alan Jackson said the company signed an agreement in New
York yesterday. He said he saw great potential for increasing Formica's
sales in Asia.
The deal comes at a sensitive time for BTR Nylex, which has been criticised
for lack of acquisition activity. Earlier this month, it brought in a new
managing director, Mr Philip Aiken, from outside the group, and signalled
that this would herald a more aggressive strategic approach.

<TEXT>
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US investment firm, yesterday won control of
foods group Borden, following a controversial Dollars 2bn buy-out offer,
writes Richard Waters. KKR said that it had acquired 63.5 per cent of
Borden's shares through an exchange offer in which it was offering part of
its stake in RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco giant. It had needed 40 per
cent to gain control.
Together with additional Borden shares acquired by exercising an option, KKR
and an investment affiliate, Whitehall Associates, will be left with 69.5
per cent of the stock.
That will give the investment group more than the two-thirds needed to pass
a plan to merge Borden's operations with those of RJR Nabisco and buy out
the remaining shareholders, KKR said.

Mr Donald Trump, the US property developer, said yesterday he had no
intention of selling his 51 per cent stake in the landmark Plaza Hotel in
New York, but said his company had been approached by people interested in
acquiring a stake in the Plaza, Reuter reports from New York.
Mr Trump told CNBC cable television that his company had had contacts with
the representative of the Sultan of Brunei, who is considered one of the
world's richest people.
'The Sultan of Brunei, his people have spoken to us, various other people
have spoken to us and we may do some kind of partnership or something,' Mr
Trump said.
The New York Post had earlier reported that the sultan and his partners had
bid more than Dollars 300m for the Fifth Avenue hotel.
However, Trump Organisation chief executive Mr Nicholas Ribis said there had
been no substantive discussions.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Prudential to put a further
Dollars 365m into broking unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Insurance, the US financial services group, said it would inject
a further Dollars 365m of new capital into Prudential Securities, its
broking and investment banking arm, writes Richard Waters.
The capital infusion is to strengthen the subsidiary's reserves to meet
claims from investors who lost money on risky limited partnerships bought
from the broker during the 1980s. It will also cover one-off charges as the
company shrinks its mortgage-backed bond business and Japanese operations.
Coming soon after the arrival of new chairman and chief executive Mr Arthur
Ryan, formerly president of Chase Manhattan, the capital injection prompted
speculation that Prudential was dressing up the unit for sale or flotation.
Prudential Securities earlier this year reached agreement with regulators to
pay Dollars 660m into a fund to compensate limited partnership investors,
and may eventually have to contribute more.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: TWA proposes new restructuring
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Trans World Airlines, the US airline trying to avert a cash crisis,
yesterday said it had a new plan for a financial restructuring which it
believed would prove acceptable to its creditors.
TWA also said it had Dollars 107m in cash at the end of November. This was
slightly down from the Dollars 114m it had at the end of September, but the
airline said the figure was rising.
TWA, once one of the world's best-known airlines, went into Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in 1992.
It re-emerged in November last year, with creditors holding 55 per cent of
the equity and employees holding 45 per cent. It has not made a profit
since.
Last October the airline announced a rescue plan under which it would nearly
halve its debt by asking creditors to swap Dollars 800m worth of loans for
equity.
As a result, the creditors' stake would rise to possibly 70 per cent and the
employees' stake would fall to about 30 per cent. Some creditors opposed the
plan because they wanted a better deal.
TWA has now come up with a revised proposal under which creditors will trade
less debt for the same amount of equity.
Mr Jeffrey Erickson, chief executive, said that although further talks could
not be ruled out, he was optimistic that the plan would be approved.

purchase of Ziff arm

AT&amp;T is reported to be close to agreeing to pay about Dollars 50m for the
on-line computer service being developed by Ziff Communications.
Although neither AT&amp;T nor Ziff would comment on the reports, sources close
to the negotiations said the deal could be completed before the end of the
year.
If the transaction went ahead, it would provide AT&amp;T with an important entry
into the rapidly expanding market for on-line computer services. It would
also complete the dismantling of the Ziff family's publishing empire.
AT&amp;T, with its large customer base from its core telephone business, hopes
to play a central role in the development of interactive telecommunications
in the US.
Although Ziff's Interchange Online Network is not expected to be ready until
next year, the service will enable users to exploit the latest multimedia
computer technology - a significant advantage over the older on-line
services provided by established companies such as CompuServe, Prodigy and
America Online.
AT&amp;T will face intense competition in the on-line computer services
business. In addition to the well-established services, it will soon face
competition from software group Microsoft, which in November announced plans
to launch an on-line service.
Microsoft said it would spend heavily on developing a service that would
provide a wide range of on-line information, products and services to users
through partnerships with telephone companies, publishers and entertainment
groups.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: GenCorp in talks over disposal
of aerospace unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GenCorp, a diversified US manufacturing group, said it was in talks over the
sale of its aerospace and defence operations, which last year accounted for
nearly half its revenues.
The company, formerly known as General Tire and Rubber, said that it had
decided that its 'first priority' was to divest the unit, after a strategic
review launched earlier this year.
The plan is the latest in a string of divestments by the company, which
would see it reduced to two businesses: manufacturing polymer products and
automotive parts.
GenCorp sold its tyre business in the late 1980s to Continental, the German
tyremaker, as part of a Dollars 1.6bn share buy-back and restructuring plan
to ward off a hostile takeover. It shed broadcasting and bottling operations
at the same time.
The defence and aerospace business, Aerojet, made operating profits of
Dollars 53m on sales of Dollars 872m last year, out of total group operating
profits of Dollars 121m on sales of Dollars 1.9bn.
The unit makes propulsion, electronic and ordnance systems.
Faced with cuts in US defence spending, GenCorp has been reducing Aerojet in
recent years, resulting in a cut in its revenues of 14 per cent last year.
A sale of the unit would leave GenCorp with operations in polymer products,
which had sales of Dollars 514m last year, and automotive parts, with sales
of Dollars 519m.
Mr John Yasinksy, who was recently appointed president and chief executive,
said that discussions had been under way with a number of potential buyers.
'These discussions will allow us to determine whether divestiture or
retention of some or all of Aerojet as part of our portfolio creates the
greatest value for our shareholders,' Mr Yasinksy said.

Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US investment firm, yesterday won control of
foods group Borden, following a controversial Dollars 2bn buy-out offer.
KKR said it had acquired 63.5 per cent of Borden's shares through an
exchange offer in which it was offering part of its stake in RJR Nabisco,
the food and tobacco giant. It had needed 40 per cent to gain control.
The offer, launched in September, had come under fire from some Borden
shareholders, who claimed the company was being sold too cheaply.
It also attracted a rival restructuring proposal from another investor, Mr
Paul Kazarian, although this did not result in any firm offer.
Together with additional Borden shares acquired by exercising an option, KKR
and an investment affiliate, Whitehall Associates, will be left with 69.5
per cent of the stock.
That will give the investment group more than the two-thirds needed to pass
a plan to merge Borden's operations with those of RJR Nabisco and buy out
the remaining shareholders, KKR said.
With RJR's shares trading at Dollars 5 3/8 yesterday morning, down Dollars
1/8 , the offer valued each Borden share at Dollars 12.31, compared with
Dollars 14.25 a share when the deal was first announced. Borden's stock was
trading as high as Dollars 18 at the beginning of this year on hopes the
company's businesses would be broken up and sold separately.

Brierley Investments, the hotels and investment group, is to buy Japan

The purchase of 22m B shares, at NZDollars 4.55 a share, takes Brierley's
total stake to in Air New Zealand to 42.5 per cent.
However, analysts believe that the move is opportunistic rather than
strategic.
The A shares, which cannot be held by foreigners, traded on Wednesday at
NZDollars 3.50, off their year's high of NZDollars 4.10.
The B shares, which can be held overseas, last traded at NZDollars 4.50 a

Air NZ said the departure of JAL from the share registry was amicable.

Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest electronics maker, could face
legal action from domestic institutional investors over extraordinary losses
from stock sales, reports Reuter from Seoul.
Samsung Electronics said it lost Won14.8bn (Dollars 18.3m) after it sold its
holding of 20m shares in Samsung General Chemicals, at Won2,600, to Samsung
Engineering and Construction and Samsung Aerospace.
Domestic institutional investors who had extended investment portfolios in
Samsung Electronics in anticipation of higher earnings in 1994 protested
against the losses and demanded an immediate shareholders' meeting.
In spite of the share-deal losses, Samsung Electronics expects a pre-tax
profit of Won1,000bn for 1994, up from Won210.23bn a year ago. The rise is
mainly attributable to higher shipments of semiconductors and personal
computers.

Terms were not disclosed, but Continental is Brazil's third-largest
manufacturer of domestic appliances, with a workforce of 3,500 and expected
sales this year of DM360m (Dollars 229m). It is profitable, but
Bosch-Siemens would not give details.
The Sao Paulo group markets its products under the Continental and Metalfrio

Bosch-Siemens said the takeover continued its preparations for the
increasing globalisation of the white-goods sector. Last month, the company
signed a joint venture agreement with a Chinese partner for the manufacture

industrial gas unit
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airgas, a Delaware-based gas distribution company, has made an unsolicited
offer for the industrial gas business of CBI Industries, valuing the unit at
Dollars 680m, writes Richard Waters. Airgas also offered to take on all of
CBI's debt, which amounts to a further Dollars 770m.
CBI dismissed the offer as 'inadequate' and said it had no intention of
selling the unit, which raised the prospect of a bidding war for the whole
company and pushed up its shares when the offer emerged on Tuesday.
The gas unit, Liquid Carbonic, has a strong presence in the international
carbon dioxide business, making it potentially attractive to other bidders.
CBI, which bought Liquid Carbonic in 1984, is also involved in construction
and engineering. These businesses have been depressed in the face of weak
capital investment by many US companies, leading to disappointing earnings
so far this year.
The gas business accounted for 44 per cent of the group's Dollars 1.7bn
sales last year.

Rhodia-Ster, a Brazilian joint venture controlled by the French chemical
company Rhone-Poulenc, -Poulenc, raised Dollars 182m from its global initial
public offering launched on Monday, writes Patrick McCurry in Sao Paulo.
The offer was oversubscribed and sold at the maximum price of Dollars 13.50
per global depositary share. Strong demand in Brazil, where the issue was
oversubscribed by six times, led global co-ordinator Paribas Capital Markets
to increase the Brazilian tranche to about 40 per cent from 33 per cent,
with about 30 per cent each going to the US and Europe.
The global depositary shares are listed on the Luxembourg stock market and
on the Portal system in the US. The Brazilian shares will begin trading on
December 28.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Thyssen unit and Deutsche Bahn
form railway group

<TEXT>
Deutsche Bahn, Germany's state-owned railways, and Thyssen Handelsunion, the
trading house of the Thyssen steel group, yesterday joined forces to form a
railway cargo transport company with the aim of sharply reducing road
traffic, cutting costs and speeding up delivery services.
The new company, BahnTrans, will be equally owned by Deutsche Bahn and
Thyssen Handelsunion, with the former providing rolling stock and the latter
logistical support.
Mr Heinz Durr, chairman of Deutsche Bahn, said he expected the new company
to carry about 4.75m tonnes of freight a year and have turnover of about
DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn).
BahnTrans, which will be based in Berlin, will start operations early in
1995.
It will operate throughout Europe.
Mr Durr said he expected BahnTrans eventually to take over 70 per cent of
the cargo currently delivered by road in Germany, adding that the country's
congested motorways and roads could have 315,000 fewer lorries on them.
Thyssen Handelsunion said that at full capacity, BahnTrans would employ more
than 3,000 people.
The majority of the staff would be taken from Deutsche Bahn, which is
restructuring following its takeover of the east German railways, and from
Thyssen Haniel Logistic, the logistics subsidiary of Thyssen Handelsunion.
The announcement comes amid increasing criticism from industry, the
retailing sector and environmental groups of increased traffic congestion in
Germany - particularly in the five eastern states, where roads are being
modernised, causing even longer delays.
'The point is that this new company will cut down costs, save time and have
a positive affect on the environment,' Thyssen Handelsunion said.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Seita sees 28% rise in net
profit for 1994
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Seita, the French state-owned tobacco group, yesterday forecast that net
profit for 1994 would rise 28 per cent to FFr670m (Dollars 123.6m) from
FFr585m last year.
The decision to give such a definitive profit prediction appears to pave the
way for the privatisation of the group early next year.
On Monday, the National Assembly passed legislation removing the civil
service status of the group's 6,200 French employees. They will be offered 5
per cent of the shares on preferential terms, with a further 2.5 per cent
going to the country's 36,000 tobacconists.
The state is to keep a 10 per cent stake and sell around 35 per cent to a
core of institutional investors, from which rival foreign tobacco
manufacturers will be excluded. The remainder will be sold on the open
market.
Seita said yesterday it had nearly doubled its operating profits to an
estimated FFr1.03bn this year from FFr538m in 1993, but its profit from
financial operations was considerably down this year because of positions
the group took on the dollar and because of investments in bonds.
In a pre-privatisation exercise to clean the slate, the company said that it
was making provisions to cover financial losses of FFr380m for the first
nine months of this year, and added that it was putting in place a better
reporting system to keep track of financial investments.
With an improvement in the last quarter of the year, Seita said it expected
to finish this year with its financial operation showing a FFr50m profit.
Seita has a unique financial advantage in that it has up to 50 days before
it has to hand over to the French state the tax it collects on cigarettes
sold in France.
Seita has a 45 per cent share of the French cigarette market, and
distributes the products of its commercial rivals to tobacconists.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bonton, an acquisitive Czech media and entertainment group, has raised
Kcs280m (Dollars 9.5m) in the first large private equity placing by a Czech
company with foreign institutional investors
The transaction is seen as a pacesetter for other Czech companies seeking to
expand in the fast-growing but undercapitalised sectors of post-communist
central Europe's most stable economy.
CS First Boston's Central European Growth Fund and funds managed by, among
others, Baring Investment Management and the US-based Emerging Markets
Corporation, took stakes in Bonton in the placing, which represented just
under 30 per cent of the company's share capital.
Bonton plans to use the proceeds from the placing, arranged by CS First
Boston, to make new acquisitions, develop its retail network, and reduce
debt. It said it would seek a public listing for its shares within two
years.
The investors acquired mainly new shares in Bonton, which has interests from
music and film production to commercial radio stations and record stores.
Bonton was founded in 1990 by Mr Martin Kratochvil, a high-profile Czech
businessman and jazz musician who is the group's chairman.
The company expects 1994 revenues of more than Kcs700m and profits of Kcs7m,
and says it aims to increase profits 10-fold by 1996.
Mr Kratochvil and Mr Michael Kocab, co-founder, are Bonton's biggest
shareholders, each with a 17 per cent stake.

bond offerings

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's ministry of finance is considering abolishing its restriction on
yen-denominated bonds issued overseas by foreign companies.
To protect the country's corporate bond market, the ministry has tried to
keep euroyen bonds offshore by prohibiting yen bonds issued overseas from
entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance.
The ministry's move would follow the easing earlier this year, amid calls
for financial deregulation, of the 'lock-up' period for bonds issued by
sovereign borrowers. This prompted a total Y5,500bn in sovereign debt to be
issued this year, 2.5 times the previous year's figure.
The ministry said the move could come in April, but expected restrictions on
euroyen debt issued by domestic borrowers to remain for the time being.
The move will provide investment opportunities for Japan's institutional
investors which want exposure in overseas companies but are loath to take
foreign currency risk.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Aramco negotiates Greek oil
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece's Vardinoyannis group is negotiating the sale of up to 50 per cent of
Motoroil Hellas, its oil refining company, to Aramco, the Saudi Arabian
state oil company. It would be the largest foreign investment in Greece for
several decades.
It would also be Aramco's first investment in Europe, although private Saudi
interests earlier this year took over Sweden's OK Petroleum group, the
Nordic region's largest refiner.
Motoroil, owned by two Panama-registered companies which belong to members
of the Vardinoyannis family, controls Greece's largest private refinery with
capacity of 4.5m tonnes annually.
The Motoroil refinery near Corinth in southern Greece supplies a chain of
600 petrol stations around Greece controlled by the Vardinoyannis group and
exports oil products through a separate trading company. Analysts in Athens
said the refinery, which was modernised five years ago, is valued at over
Dollars 400m.
Aramco has long been seeking a European refining and marketing outlet. Such
a development would be in line with a trend among many state oil companies
to develop downstream networks in their main crude oil markets.
Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, for example, has built an extensive European
refining and marketing network under the Q8 brand.
Aramco is a partner in the Star downstream joint venture with Texaco in the
US. It recently acquired a 40 per cent stake in Petron Corporation, the
leading oil company in the Philippines.
Previous Aramco overtures to European refiners have generally foundered over
failure to agree a price. Aramco's European ambitions have, however, been
pared back recently. This is because of the maturity of the European market,
a shortage of investment funds due to relatively low crude oil prices and a
shift in strategic emphasis to Asia, the world's fastest-growing oil market.
Analysts say Dollars 400m would be a good price for the refinery. The
location would give the Saudis a European base relatively close to home and
well positioned to supply new markets in eastern Europe.
Motoroil posted profits last year of Dr6bn (Dollars 25m) on turnover of
Dr189.2bn.
The Vardinoyannis group operates one of Greece's largest tanker fleets, but
has diversified into banking and services since 1990.

FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Neste prepares Finland's largest
sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Preparations for what could be Finland's largest privatisation have taken a
step forward with a proposal by Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group, to
issue up to 18m new shares, or a 20 per cent stake in the company, during
1995.
The government, which owns 97 per cent of Neste, is expected to approve the
proposal at a special shareholders' meeting on December 29 and clear the way
for the country's biggest industrial group, by sales, to seek a listing on
the Helsinki stock exchange.
Neste wants authorisation to issue for subscription a maximum of 18m new
shares with a nominal value of FM10 a share.
Some estimates have valued Neste, which had sales of FM33bn (Dollars 6.8bn)
in the first eight months of the year, at FM10bn, implying that the sale of
a 20 per cent stake in the company would raise more than any single Finnish
privatisation issue to date.
However, the company and the government are adopting a cautious approach,
refusing to set a timetable or speculate on the price and other conditions
of the planned issue.
A recent cooling of the Helsinki stock market - which has been Europe's top
performing bourse this year - and the withdrawal this month of a FM1.5bn
share issue by Kymmene, the forestry group, have raised concerns about the
market's ability to digest further big issues.
A slowly accelerating privatisation programme by the centre-right government
has seen FM7.4bn raised in the last 12 months through the sell-off of stakes
in five companies - Outokumpu, the mining group; Rautaruukki, the steel
producer; Valmet, the paper-machine maker; Veitsiluoto, the pulp and paper
manufacturer; and Kemira, the chemicals group.
The latest issue is a FM500m offer of 12m new shares in Finnair, Finland's
national airline, announced this month.
Neste has been seen for some time as the most likely next candidate. The
government has parliamentary approval to reduce its stake to a minimum of
50.1 per cent, in line with the step-by-step approach to privatisation
adopted by Helsinki under which the state usually retains a majority or
large minority holding.
Neste has been restructured over the past few years to sharpen its focus on
oil and energy.
It has returned to the black this year, swinging to a pre-tax profit of
FM879m in the fist eight months from a loss of FM1.3bn in the same period
last year.

<TEXT>
Novo Nordisk, the Danish healthcare products and industrial enzymes
producer, yesterday announced changes in its business strategy, saying that
it would focus its efforts on fewer business areas and seek partnerships to
develop business areas which are not its core businesses.
'We must position ourselves in a few selected areas where we know we can
stay ahead,' said Mr Mads Ovlisen, the group's chief executive. He said the
group faced large investments in plant over the next few years and was
seeking to build capacity as efficiently as possible.
The changes were announced after a disappointing year for Novo Nordisk,
which reported a fall in profits after nine months to DKr934m (Dollars 151m)
compared with DKr1bn in the same period in 1993.
The group's main healthcare production is in insulin and other diabetic care
products, of which it is one of the world's two leading suppliers together
with Eli Lily of the US. Its other main division is industrial enzymes. Both
these areas will remain core business areas.
'After months of analysis we have concluded that there will be continued
growth in diabetics care and we want to remain strong in this area,' said Mr
Ovlisen.
Hormone replacement therapy (female health products) and human growth
hormone will remain core business areas, but blood products and central
nervous system therapy products will be downgraded.
The groups said the health care division's research and development was
being centralised as a separate division in order to improve utilisation of
resources.

<TEXT>
Swedbank, the Nordic region's biggest bank by asset value, yesterday made
its first move to take a stake in a foreign bank, buying a 7.5 per cent
stake in Finland's Aktia Bank for SKr47m (Dollars 6.25m).
The Swedish bank is to take up 1.5m of 2.5m new shares being issued at a
price of FM20 a share by Aktia, a small bank with assets of FM8.6bn. Aktia
intends to apply for a listing on the Helsinki stock exchange next year.
Aktia's main market is in Finland's small Swedish-speaking minority.
Swedbank, with assets of almost SKr490bn, has become a force in Sweden. It
emerged in its present form when a group of Swedish savings banks were
thrown together in 1992 following the loan loss crisis which hit Sweden's
banks.
It has become profitable this year and plans a listing on the Stockholm
stock exchange in 1995.
However, the bank said its Aktia acquisition did not signal any strategic
diversification overseas.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Boddington purchases nursing homes from
Bupa
</HEADLINE>

   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boddington Group is to expand its nursing homes division by about 60 per
cent with the purchase of the Care for the Elderly subsidiary of Bupa, the
UK's largest private healthcare provider, for up to Pounds 30.7m.
The subsidiary has 448 beds in 10 homes mainly in southern England. It made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.8m on turnover of Pounds 8.6m in 1993.
The deal will make Boddington the leader in the premium sector of the
nursing homes market with a 'powerful position' in south-east England.
The price was criticised as too high by Laing and Buisson, a care home
consultant. A typical valuation for homes was Pounds 40,000 per bed but
Boddington was paying over Pounds 60,000, it said.
Boddington said the price compared favourably with, for example, the sum it
paid recently to build a home in Hertfordshire. Moreover, it was buying
freehold properties valued at about Pounds 23m.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: RJB 'pleased' with share sale outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investors have taken up fewer than a sixth of the shares available
to them in RJB Mining's sale of shares to fund the purchase of British
Coal's English regions.
RJB said applications for 2.67m shares had been received in the public offer
for sale in which private investors and employees were invited to subscribe.
This represents 43 per cent of the first 6.25m shares in the public offer;
however, the company had said that another 12.5m shares would be made
available if there was sufficient demand.
RJB said it was pleased with the result, given current market conditions and
the 'contested nature of the bid' - a reference to rival bidders' strong
criticism of the Pounds 815m paid by the company. It said its fund-raising
had always been aimed primarily at institutional investors and these had
proved extremely receptive.
All 125m shares being issued have been placed with institutions. Those
applied for by the public will be clawed back.
The successful placing, announced by the company a fortnight ago, was
regarded a considerable achievement even by RJB's rival bidders in view of
the adverse publicity surrounding the bid and the company's projections for
future markets.
RJB, led by chief executive Mr Richard Budge, is forecasting pre-tax profits
of Pounds 220m a year by the end of the decade on the assumption that it
will be selling 34m tonnes of coal from the regions it is buying. Some
critics say even 25m tonnes would be optimistic.
The application for 2.67m shares in the public offer includes 281,000 for
employees. A further 848,000 shares are being allocated to eligible
employees under a free employee share offer.
About 64 per cent of employees have already taken up free shares. RJB will
continue to accept applications until December 29. The new shares are being
issued at 320p, against a suspended share price of 348p. Dealing recommences
on December 30, when RJB is due to take over the regions it is buying.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Go-ahead for Halifax merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is to allow the
merger plans between two of the UK's largest building societies to go ahead
without reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The decision was welcomed yesterday by both Halifax and Leeds Permanent, the
UK's largest and fifth biggest societies, which announced last month plans
to merge and then to convert to a public limited company with a full banking
licence.
If the deal goes ahead, it will create the third-largest high street bank,
with about Pounds 90bn in assets.
The two societies have about 20 per cent of outstanding UK mortgage balances
and about 24 per cent of new mortgage business.
Now that an MMC inquiry - which could have delayed the deal by about three
months - has been avoided, the next certain stage for the merger process to
go ahead will be the approval of the 10m members of the two societies.
Halifax and Leeds plan to issue information in early February before the
special meetings of the two organisations which are expected to take place
in late March.
But the Building Societies Commission, the statutory regulator, may insist
that before the merger decision, the two societies' members are told about
the likely distribution of free shares when the combined society becomes a
plc.
This could mean a court hearing before the special meetings in order to
clarify whether the plans are within the legislative restrictions on how
shares can be given to members.
When Abbey National, the former society, became a public limited company it
distributed shares on a flat rate basis, but Halifax has signalled that it
is looking at other methods of allocation.
Meanwhile, Leeds confirmed last night its 5,500 staff had received a 7 per
cent profit-related pay bonus as a result of the society's performance in
the financial year to the end of September.
The society said the payment had been decided before the merger plan with
Halifax was announced and was unconnected with the move.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank funds buy with Pounds 17m
rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Walker Greenbank, the wallcoverings and fabrics group, is raising Pounds
16.8m through a 1-for-5 rights issue to finance the acquisition of Warner
Fabrics and to fund capital expenditure plans.
The acquired business, which specialises in the design and sale of high
quality furnishing fabrics, was bought from Collins &amp; Aikman of the US for
Pounds 4.45m cash, including repayment of a Pounds 2.58m inter-company loan.
The rights issue, priced at 90p a share against yesterday's level of 109p,
up 1 1/2 p on the day, will also clear Warner's outstanding bank debt of
Pounds 2m.
Mr Charles Wightam, chief executive, described the acquisition as one of the
'sweetest deals' Walker Greenbank had done. He said it would 'fit perfectly
with our existing consumer operations, particularly Zoffany,' the wallpaper
and fabrics supplier.
Warner suffered an operating loss of Pounds 49,000 in 1993, on sales of
Pounds 8.27m. This year it is expected to break even. Mr Wightam maintained
that through Walker's sales and distribution network and an improved design
strategy, profits could be increased considerably.
Warner has a 125 year-old archive of fabric designs. Mr Wightam said: 'This
treasure trove will be a unique source of designs for us over the next 50
years.'
The remaining Pounds 10m from the rights issue, underwritten by SG Warburg,
would be spent mainly on a Pounds 9.4m distribution and office complex for
Muraspec, the group's marketing and distribution division for Europe based
in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.94m (Pounds 7.08m) were forecast for the year to
January 31, including Pounds 26,000 from a property disposal. The expected
final dividend of 2.3p (2.1p) would give a total of 3.6p (3.3p).

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Starmin to raise Pounds 5.8m in placing and
disposal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Starmin, the quarry products company, has announced a series of changes
designed to ensure its survival.
It plans to raise Pounds 2.48m in a placing and open offer, sell its Lovie
activities for Pounds 3.3m, appoint a new management and undergo a capital
reorganisation.
It is issuing 401.8m shares at 0.75p with a 7-for-10 clawback. To enable the
placing to go ahead the 5p shares are being split into 0.1p ordinary and
4.9p deferred.
The Lovie quarry companies in north-east Scotland are being bought by Mr W
Lovie, managing director of Starmin (Scotland), for Pounds 3.3m cash
resulting in a book loss of Pounds 621,000. Starmin will concentrate on its
landfill and aggregates business at Water Hall Farm in Hertfordshire and
plans to change its name to Water Hall Group.
In addition, the Starmin Pension plan is being wound up with the expected
surplus of Pounds 200,000 being paid to the company.
Lord Parkinson is to resign as chairman and be replaced by Mr Edward Weiss.
Mr Stuart Larnder will become chief executive in place of Mr Michael Gurner.
The sale and placing will cut gearing from 424 per cent at June 30 to a
pro-forma 66 per cent.
Starmin is in breach of its bank facilities. Its bankers have confirmed the
avail-ability of the facilities until January 18 and have agreed to provide
ongoing working capital for 12 months from the EGM agreeing the plans.
However, the company warned that rejection of the plans would mean it would
have to seek alternative financing.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Select Inds to acquire AirBoss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Select Industries, the USM-traded company which, through a subsidiary,
produces the AirBoss tyre for off-road vehicles, plans to acquire AirBoss
Tyres of Australia, which holds a 50.4 per cent voting stake in Select.
The deal will simplify the complex ownership structure of the various
individual companies involved with the non-pneumatic tyre and the new
company will be known as AirBoss Group.
Perth-based AirBoss Tyres and its listed parent, AirBoss, own the right to
the wheel system technology. AirBoss Ground Engagement, the Abingdon-based
subsidiary of Select, has a licence to produce the tyre for Europe and some
other markets.
AirBoss said yesterday the existing structure did not provide a clear and
unified corporate image to customers in the construction equipment industry.
The refocusing, with operations merged into one company quoted in London and
managed from the UK, was 'the next logical step' in the evolution of AirBoss
and its technology.

BM Group, the engineering company, hit back yesterday at the petition filed
at the High Court by three of the preference shareholders of Blackwood
Hodge, the company it acquired in 1990.
Describing the petition as 'ill-conceived', Mr Alun Hicks, group finance
director, said: 'BM remains firmly of the view, with the benefit of robust
legal advice, that the petition has no legal merit.'
The petition, which was filed on November 30, alleges that the affairs of
Blackwood Hodge have been conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interests
of its preference shareholders.

before 'we have embarked upon any significant acquisition or development.'
Turnover was Pounds 240,000, against Pounds 1.49m which took in Pounds 1.36m

BRE's publishing activities range from a monthly subscription digest to

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: QMH chief issues warning - AGM told of
threat of collapse if Pounds 1.3bn debt restructuring rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman of Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group,
warned shareholders attending the annual meeting in London yesterday that
the company could collapse if they refused to approve the Pounds 1.3bn debt
restructuring announced last week.
'If shareholders do not approve the restructuring, insolvency is almost
certain to occur,' Mr Metcalfe said.
They will be unable to vote on the proposals, however, until all of Queens
Moat's 74 lenders approve the package. One lender is still resisting the
deal.
The AGM lasted a shorter-than-expected two hours, and resulted in the
overwhelming approval of all eight resolutions to adopt the 1993 accounts
and re-elect directors and auditors.
The 200 or more shareholders who attended were clearly not prepared for a
repeat of last year's angry four-hour AGM.
'I am not staying all day,' muttered one elderly investor. 'I want to get
home for Christmas.'
Investors did, however, want clarification on the restructuring proposals
which could leave the banks with 60 per cent of the group.
Mr Alan Reed, a Bristol-based solicitor, felt it was inappropriate to vote
on the re-election of directors until the restructuring had been considered
by shareholders.
Mr Reed, who is the personal solicitor to Mr John Bairstow, Queens Moat's
previous chairman and chief executive, called for an adjournment of the AGM.
Mr Metcalfe, armed with some 304m proxies, brusquely dismissed Mr Reed's
proposal as 'totally inappropriate' and insisted that it be put to a poll.
Shareholders, angry at the time a poll would take, were vociferously opposed
to a vote but Mr Metcalfe refused to listen to calls from the floor.
Eventually, Mr Reed withdrew his call for an adjournment.
Shareholders also quizzed the board over new contracts which could this year
more than double the salaries of the chief executive, finance director and
chief operating officer, through several incentives.
'Don't you think it is inappropriate,' asked one investor, 'when
shareholders are making such substantial sacri-fices that executive
directors should be awarded further bonuses?'
Mr Metcalfe's response was simple: 'No. Sorry. I don't agree with you.'
Investors were more reassured by the board's comments on trading. The UK
division was meeting the industry average of Pounds 7,400 gross operating

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Aerospace buys Pascall for Pounds 5.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aerospace Engineering, the precision engineering group which yesterday
reported a 72 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits, has acquired
Pascall, the electronic equipment and component manufacturer, for a maximum
of Pounds 5.5m.
The group also announced plans to restructure its share capital and change
its name to Intelek.
The initial consideration for Pascall is Pounds 3m, to be satisfied by the
issue of 3m new Aerospace Engineering ordinary shares, representing 7.9 per
cent of the issued share capital, with the balance in cash and loan notes.
The remaining consideration will be satisfied by up to 2.5m more shares and
loan notes, depending on Pascall's profitability up until 1996.
Pascall made pre-tax profits of Pounds 184,000 on turnover of Pounds 5.3m in
the year to September 30.
Aerospace Engineering has also proposed a capital reconstruction which would
effectively lower the nominal value of its shares from 25p to 5p. The shares
closed yesterday at 16 1/2 p.
The company's pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 fell from
Pounds 127,000 to Pounds 35,000 on turnover down 3 per cent at Pounds 7.47m
(Pounds 7.72m).
Continuing activities showed an operating loss of Pounds 167,000 (Pounds
292,000 profit) after a Pounds 160,000 restructuring charge and poor
performance by CML, part of the group's aerospace division. The disposal of
property in Swindon resulted in a profit of Pounds 471,000.
Earnings per share fell from 0.12p to 0.09p. The interim dividend is
unchanged at 0.25p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Riva Group, the USM-quoted supplier of electronic point of sale systems, has
completed arrangements with its bankers which improve the value of
shareholders' funds by Pounds 1.4m and reduce gearing. The profit and loss
account should also benefit by about Pounds 1.3m.
FennoScandia Bank, Securum Finance and Mr Tom Milne, a former director, will
be repaid Pounds 911,000, with the Pounds 1.31m balance of the debt to
FennoScandia and Securum waived.
The Co-operative Bank is providing funds and increasing its facilities to
the group. It will also subscribe Pounds 100,000 for the issue of 888,889
new ordinary shares at 11 1/4 p against a market price of 10p. This will
reduce Riva's debt to it.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall in early stage of takeover
talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group, said yesterday that was in talks
with unnamed parties about its possible acquisition.
In a statement following the close of trading, Jupiter's board noted the
recent rise in its share price and speculation about the company's future,
and issued the statement as a result.
Yesterday, the shares rose 7p to close at 402p, compared with about 300p in
mid-September.
The company said discussions were being held 'with a small number of
parties'. Talks were at an early stage and there was no indication that an
offer would be made at a premium to the share's present level.
Speculation has centred on a continental financial institution, possibly a
German insurer. It is likely that in agreeing to any offer, Jupiter would
seek a buyer which offered business possibilities, such as access to a
continental distribution network for its retail financial products.
Jupiter made the announcement after consultation with its advisers and
discussion with the Takeover Panel.
About 40 per cent of Jupiter's shares are held by management or individuals
associated with them.
Last summer, Jupiter sold its banking division to Cater Allen, the money
broker, and said it intended to concentrate on expanding its fund management
business.
It acquired Queen Anne's Gate Asset Management last September, a move which
expanded its assets under management to Pounds 4.15bn.
In the six months to September 30, the company also increased its assets by
Pounds 350m in net new cash from clients.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hickson profit shortfall after Unilever
decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hickson International, the specialty chemical company, said yesterday it
would suffer a profit shortfall following the decision of Unilever to halt
purchases of the controversial manganese catalyst in Persil Power and other
Unilever detergents. Its shares fell 12p to 114p.
Despite the setback, the group was still on track to meet market forecasts
of pre-tax profits for 1994 of between Pounds 21m and Pounds 23m, against
Pounds 22.1m a year earlier.
Hickson said it had already won orders from two pharmaceutical companies to
help use the capacity of the plant in Ireland affected by Unilever's
decision.
Unilever cut the content of the catalyst in the fabric detergents by 80 per
cent this summer. It reformulated the products after discovering that the
new detergents were reacting adversely to a small selection of deep dyes in
cotton and viscose fabrics.
The problem, which gave rise to the soap war between Unilever and Procter &amp;
Gamble, its rival, has been solved by reducing the catalyst, Unilever said.
As a result of the reduced catalyst, Unilever has sufficient stocks to last
until the end of next year, Hickson said. Unilever, which is on a
take-or-pay contract lasting to the middle of next year, is negotiating a
settlement with Hickson.
In a full year the catalyst, which had accounted for half the plant's
production, would have contributed some Pounds 8m of operating profit to
Hickson but because of the settlement the shortfall would be less, Hickson
said.
Hickson said Unilever was aware that the plant would be fully committed to
other products when it wanted to resume production of the catalyst. Hickson,
therefore, might not wish to produce for Unilever.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Black wins option on Telegraph shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In what is almost the end of an era, the Berry family, once proud owners of
The Daily Telegraph, has decided to dispose of most of its remaining shares
in the national newspaper group to Hollinger - Mr Conrad Black's main
company.
Under an agreement reached yesterday with the Telegraph Newspaper Trust,
which holds the family shares, Hollinger can acquire from the trustee 7m
ordinary Telegraph shares at 450p each.
The agreement provides that Hollinger can acquire the shares between April
15 and October 24 next year. In the period from November 8 to November 30
Hollinger 'may be required by the trustee to acquire the shares'.
Lord Hartwell, the former chairman of The Daily Telegraph, and his brother
Lord Camrose, both directors of the trust and of The Daily Telegraph, will
retire from the Telegraph board one year after the shares are sold.
The trustee currently holds 7.99m shares in The Daily Telegraph,
representing 5.91 per cent of the capital.
It is not clear why the Telegraph Newspaper Trust has decided to sell,
although Lord Hartwell said yesterday it was time for the family to spread
its interests now that it no longer controlled the company.
Mr Adrian Berry, a science writer on The Daily Telegraph, will remain a
Telegraph director.

FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Highland lifts stake in Remy to 16.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Highland Distilleries, maker of Famous Grouse Scotch whisky, is to raise its
stake in Remy Cointreau, the French cognac, champagne and liqueurs group,
from 11.6 per cent to 16.1 per cent through a series of deals, writes
Roderick Oram.
Highland is achieving this by moving from a 25 per cent stake in a company
which had a 46.4 per cent stake in Remy to a 30 per cent stake in a company
which has a 53.7 per cent stake.
Highland said it would benefit from closer ties with Remy in distribution
and other areas of co-operation, and from gaining a more direct stake in the
company.
The relationship between the groups, which has benefited drinks brands from
both companies in a number of country markets, dates back to 1990.
The trigger for the deals was the desire by the Heriard Dubreuil family to
consolidate its direct and indirect stakes in Remy into a stake in Orpar,
Remy's controlling company.
Highland will increase its stake in Orpar from 25 per cent to 30 per cent at
a cost of Pounds 22.5m. It has also spent Pounds 19.4m to buy Remy shares in
the market to maintain its stake when Orpar lifts its investment in Remy
from 46.4 per cent to 53.7 per cent.
Highland is increasing its stake in Orpar by buying the 50 per cent of HRB
Investments it does not already own. The company's sole asset is convertible
bonds in Orpar.
The seller of HRB is Robertson &amp; Baxter, which will receive 5.42m Highland
shares in exchange. This will lift Robertson's stake in Highland from 14.7
per cent to 18.2 per cent.
Highland and Robertson, both founded by the same family, have cross
shareholdings dating back more than 100 years and operate essentially as an
informal group.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Electricity regulator's bid role under fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Professor Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry regulator, was yesterday
embroiled in political controversy after the disclosure that Trafalgar
House's idea to offer a rebate to Northern Electric customers originated
from a meeting with him. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's trade spokesman,
questioned whether Prof Littlechild had behaved with 'proper conduct'.
In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, he asked:
'Under which of his responsibilities does he advise companies engaged in
hostile takeovers of regional electricity companies?'
Trafalgar has launched a Pounds 1.2bn hostile bid for Northern.
Swiss Bank Corporation, advising Trafalgar, said yesterday that Prof
Littlechild had asked at the meeting a month ago what benefits there would
be for the consumer of a potential bid.
'We formed the view that it would be easier for (Prof Littlechild) to
consider a (regional electricity company) bid that contained in its terms a
tangible benefit for the consumer, over and above the tariff reduction that
was published in August.'
Following the meeting, Trafalgar decided on a rebate of Pounds 20 per
customer, costing Pounds 26m, if the bid was successful. 'The choice of a
special rebate and the determination of a sum of Pounds 20 was not discussed
with (Prof Littlechild) at any stage prior to the bid being announced.'
Prof Littlechild's office had no specific comment yesterday. In a letter to
Mr Derek Foster, opposition chief whip, he confirmed the meeting took place
on November 25 and that he had asked the company how customers would benefit
if the acquisition went ahead. 'The particular proposal which Trafalgar
House have since made was not discussed.'
Mr Cunningham said if the regulator thought there was potential for rebates
'why is he letting Northern charge customers more than seems necessary?' Mr
Cunningham asked Mr Heseltine for his views on 'a number of disturbing
aspects' to the bid. Mr Cunningham said it was important that Mr Heseltine
'urgently clarify' his view of matters including the role of the regulator
and his statutory duties. The Department of Trade and Industry said it was
considering the letter.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Down to earth and looking for foreign growth: Singapore
Telecom's tough task of living up to lofty expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Has Singapore Telecom, south-east Asia's biggest listed company, bitten off
more than it can chew?
When ST was partially privatised last year even the most sceptical brokers
and analysts were impressed. The float of 11 per cent of ST (the other 89
per cent is held by the government) gave the island republic's
telecommunications and postal group a market capitalisation of more than
SDollars 55bn (Pounds 24bn).
ST, servicing a country with a population of only 2.8m, was propelled into
the top 30 of the world's largest companies, on par with British Telecom and
above giants such as Ford and Unilever.
Now the euphoria surrounding ST has disappeared. ST shares, which peaked at
SDollars 5 soon after its October 1993 flotation, have dropped back to
around SDollars 2.80. Some blame the fall on a general dip in the market: ST
accounts for about 50 per cent of Singapore's total market capitalisation.
But interim results announced last month showing a 16 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to SDollars 900m produced little reaction. 'The results were
a non-event,' said one analyst. 'ST is still trading at a price earnings
ratio of more than 30. People who bought high should be worried. If they are
going to get their money back it will be a very long-term affair.'
The problem for ST is to live up to the high expectations evident during
last year's flotation.
ST's deputy president is Mr Lee Hsien Yang. The youngest son of Mr Lee Kuan
Yew, Singapore's senior minister, Mr Lee, who is in his 30s, joined ST this
year. He points out that so far ST has achieved its profit forecasts. 'We
said then that we would achieve 12 per cent profit growth,' he says. 'Last
year it was 15 per cent and we can continue to perform well. The share price
has underperformed. We are confident things will change.'
Analysts say ST is a well-run, efficient company. It earns revenues per line
of Dollars 1,750, against Hong Kong Telecom's Dollars 1,000 per line or
Telekom Malaysia's Dollars 640. But with limited room for expansion in its
home market there is concern about where future long-term growth will come
from. ST has a monopoly on national and international communications until
2007 and on mobile services until 1997.
'Singapore should not be compared with countries like France or Britain but
rather with other cities - like New York or Tokyo,' says Mr Lee. 'We still
have some way to go to catch up with line penetration in those cities.'
Singapore's telecoms network is among the world's most advanced. By 1997 the
whole island will have access to a fibre optic network. Mr Lee says that the
potential for add-on services, including multimedia, is considerable. In the
last six-month period ST's add-on services grew more than 20 per cent.
Mobile services are a strong growth area - up 40 per cent in the last six
months. Seven per cent of Singaporeans have mobile phones, one of the
highest rates in Asia, and 27 per cent have pagers - the highest rate in the
world.
ST knows that in the long-term it cannot rely on domestic operations for
growth. It has been taking tentative steps outside Singapore with SDollars
600m of investments in 10 countries.
ST is still a small player in international telecoms: profits from such
operations as mobile services in Norway and a SDollars 200m investment in
cable and telephony links in the UK will take time before they have an
impact on earnings. ST is seeking to sell its expertise in fast expanding
regional markets. But the regulatory environment in many Asian countries is
still unattractive to outside operators.
Just under 50 per cent of ST's total revenues come from international direct
dialled (IDD) calls. In the latest six-month period international traffic
grew 12 per cent, but the company is under constant pressure to revise its
rates in line with the big operators in other countries, particularly in the
US. ST's revenues are also being affected by the increasing use in Singapore
of US-based callback services which allow users to direct overseas calls
through the US to take advantage of lower rates.
ST recently made IDD rate cuts, making some calls up to 48 per cent cheaper.
Analysts say ST will have trouble recouping the drop in annual revenues of
more than SDollars 200m. Mr Lee disagrees: 'We still expect the healthy
growth in international traffic to continue. As for the callback operators,
people are beginning to realise that they cannot offer the service of
companies like ours and there are hidden costs involved.'
But despite Mr Lee's optimism, the jury is still out on ST's long-term
prospects. Some brokers say ST has become the victim of the government's
aggressive share pricing strategy at the time of flotation. Fifty per cent
of the offer was offered at SDollars 2 or under to Singaporeans who could
buy shares for their provident funds. The rest was offered to locals and
foreigners at SDollars 3.60.
'The government hyped up the flotation to unrealistic levels,' says one
analyst. 'It reaped millions from the exercise. But ST is left holding the
baby. There was talk of another tranche of shares being offered. But that
looks doubtful in the near future.
'Most Singaporeans are holding on to their shares because they have been
promised share bonuses. Those are going to affect the pricing still further.
ST has to pull something fairly dramatic out of the hat to improve its
market performance.'

FT  22 DEC 94 / Montague throws in towel to end bankruptcy battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Montague finally conceded defeat yesterday in his attempt to stave
off bankruptcy, resigning as chief executive of Tiphook, the trailer rental
company he founded 16 years ago.
The Pounds 2.5m bankruptcy writ being brought by the Royal Bank of Scotland
will not be opposed by Mr Montague's solicitors when it is heard this
morning at Oxford county court.
Mr Montague had been trying to reach an agreement with his creditors - to
whom he is said to owe more than Pounds 35m - following the bank's writ in
September.
However, negotiations broke down, prompting Barclays Bank last week to issue
its own writ on the estimated Pounds 9m it is owed. Barclays is also thought
to have appointed its own re-ceivers, to look after the affairs of Mr
Montague's Oxfordshire estate.
His bankruptcy would have disqualified him from sitting on the board of
Tiphook, which earlier this year almost collapsed under the weight of its
debts. Last week it renamed itself Central Transport Rental Group as part of
its reconstruction. Mr Ian Clubb, the chairman, will take over Mr Montague's
responsibil-ities.
Mr Montague will receive no compensation from CTR. His 4.5m share options
will be cancelled. Only 2m of these could have been exercised.
However, he will receive a previously agreed payment of Pounds 250,000, due
to be paid in September 1995, as part of the sale of Tiphook's container
operations in January to Transamerica.
The flamboyant Mr Montague, 46 - famous for his extravagant braces and suave
appearance - was one of the most successful businessmen of the 1980s. His
success in building Tiphook from scratch into the second largest container
group in the world earned him a CBE in 1990 and a large following among
institutional investors.
However, he borrowed heavily against his share holding in Tiphook to take up
his rights in a number of the company's issues in the late 1980s.
When the Tiphook share price collapsed, Mr Montague was left with his own
huge debts. Mr Montague's lavish lifestyle, including a Pounds 7m yacht and
an Pounds 8m estate in Oxfordshire, added to the problems. He was also
criticised for the large salaries commanded by some Tiphook directors.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Warburg wins Railtrack mandate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg has beaten other investment banks including Morgan Stanley, the
bank with which it planned to merge until last week, in the competition to
advise the UK government on the privatisation of Railtrack.
The government is to announce shortly that it has appointed Warburg as
adviser and global co-ordinator of the share sale. The sale is expected to
value Railtrack, which runs British Rail's track, signalling and stations,
at up to Pounds 5bn.
The government is expected to sell between 51 per cent and 100 per cent of
Railtrack in a public offering in spring 1996. The company's assets include
10,200 miles of railway track, 2,500 stations, and 9,000 bridges and
viaducts.
Bankers said the task of privatising Railtrack was extremely complex because
of the age and nature of its assets. The mandate was likely to put at risk
the reputation of the adviser, but bolster it if completed successfully.
Warburg beat a joint bid by Morgan Stanley and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the
investment banking arm of Barclays, and bids from Kleinwort Benson, and
groups led by Schroders and Samuel Montagu. The banks on the shortlist made
presentations on Friday. Samuel Montagu has given strategic advice to the
government on Railtrack until now. The firm said it would continue to
provide some high-level strategic advice on the government's rail
privatisation programme.
The BZW-Morgan Stanley alliance is part of a trend toward joint bids for
important privatisation mandates. BZW and Kleinwort Benson joined forces to
gain the role of adviser on privatisation of the power generating companies.
The Department of Transport nor Warburg would not confirm the appointment
yesterday, but banks involved in the bidding said they had been told that
Warburg had won. The department said an announcement would be made soon. The
appointment will give Warburg, which was adviser and global co-ordinator on
the last two British Telecom share sales, a boost amid speculation that the
merger collapse has distracted it and helped rivals to win business.
Executives are thought to be particularly pleased that they beat a combined
approach from BZW and Morgan Stanley, because it means the government has
accepted the view that Warburg has sufficient distribution strength in the
US.
US firms have competed strongly for European privatisation mandates because
of US distribution strength. But a smaller slice of Railtrack equity is
expected to be sold in the US than the 20 per cent of the third BT sale.
Morgan Stanley has won, or been only narrowly beaten in several
privatisation 'beauty contests' between banks since appointing Mr Francis
Maude, a former financial secretary in the government, to head its
privatisation unit. It was last week appointed to advise the government on
its golden share in the National Grid, a success which it cited as testament
to its European business. This came under scrutiny during negotiations on a
merger with Warburg.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Rolls-Royce head quits on BMW link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Ward is to quit as chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, which
has just signed a collaboration agreement with BMW of Germany.
The move, at the end of next week, is believed to reflect a divergence of
views with the parent Vickers board on how best to take the luxury cars
business into the 21st century.
Mr Ward, who is 48 and president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, will also cease to be Vickers' managing director, operations.
However, he will remain an executive director of Vickers and will stay on as
Rolls-Royce chairman for at least six months.
After that, 'Mr Ward has decided that his career objectives can best be
satisfied outside Vickers', said Vickers. Mr Ward was said to be
'unavailable' last night.
Yesterday's announcement came just 48 hours after a deal between Rolls-Royce
and BMW, under which the German carmaker will supply engines and other
technology to Rolls-Royce, based in the Crewe, Cheshire.
BMW, which owns Rover Group - the supplier of Rolls-Royce car bodies - won
the partnership deal after months of negotiations in which its German rival,
Mercedes-Benz, began as the favourite to become the UK company's partner. Mr
Ward is understood to have preferred the Mercedes option.
His departure is likely to be greeted with concern by Rolls-Royce's 2,500
workforce, as he has been a popular figure despite driving through changes
in working practices and other reforms.
Mr Chris Woodwark, chief executive of Vickers' Cosworth Engineering
subsidiary, is to succeed Mr Ward as Rolls-Royce chief executive.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Names win in court as Lloyd's unveils fall in capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hard-hit Lloyd's of London members notched up another court victory
yesterday - theoretically worth Pounds 80m - as the insurance market
unveiled figures showing still more Names ceasing active participation and a
fall in underwriting capacity.
The High Court ruling on damages for Names on the Gooda Walker syndicate
387, which reported some of the biggest losses in Lloyd's history, coincided
with figures showing the market's underwriting capacity will fall to Pounds
10.2bn in 1995 compared with Pounds 10.9bn this year.
The number of Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported
the insurance market - actively underwriting will fall by about 15 per cent
to 14,804, the biggest percentage fall for three years.
However, Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said this was in line with the
market's requirements. 'Lloyd's underwriters are still being selective in
the business that they write. Present market conditions indicate that there
are good opportunities for underwriting profitable business in 1995,' he
said.
Much of the shortfall in capacity resulting from Names seeking to resign has
been made up by new corporate capital, which will account for about 23 per
cent of capacity next year, compared with 15 per cent in 1994.
New corporate investors raised Pounds 331m for investing in 1995, largely in
'dedicated' companies which invest in only a few syndicates and are regarded
as embryonic insurance companies.
Lloyd's leaders hope corporate capital will provide a long-term source of
capacity, and forecast that the number of traditional Names may fall to a
few thousand over the next few years. But fears about outstanding
liabilities and litigation, which may make it hard for the market to pass
regulators' solvency tests, has put off many investors this year.
Many Names are expected to convert from trading on the basis of unlimited
liability to limited liability, though only four have done this in time for
1995. Another 19 people are entering as traditional Lloyd's Names.
The Gooda Walker 387 judgment puts the approximately 300 Names who brought
the case at the head of the queue of those seeking to tap the pool of
'errors and omissions' insurance cover available for negligence awards.
Separately, the Court of Appeal yesterday overturned an earlier court
decision which had barred about 1,000 Names suing for losses incurred on
Merrett insurance syndicates because they did not lodge the claim in time.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Former Thatcher adviser chosen to head Downing St policy
unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday began to reconstruct his inner team of advisers at
Number 10 Downing Street by naming a little-known party loyalist as his main
backroom strategist.
In a surprise choice, Mr Major appointed Mr Norman Blackwell, a 42-year-old
management consultant, to run the No 10 policy unit, which will formulate
the prime minister's political planning in the run-up to the next general
election.
Mr Blackwell, who replaces Mrs Sarah Hogg, the former economics journalist,
was an adviser to Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, in her successful 1987
election campaign, particularly on industrial and employment issues and
inner-city regeneration.
The selection of a political unknown for one of the top jobs in government
was seen at Westminster as Mr Major's latest effort to freshen the party's
ideas and policies.
Apart from Mrs Hogg, at least three other members of the policy unit - Mr
Damian Green, Miss Jill Rutter and Mr Nicholas True - are about to leave.
At Conservative Central Office, Mr Tim Collins is expected to quit as
director of communications. There have also been suggestions that Mr Andrew
Lansley will resign as head of the Conservative Research Department, which
is in charge of policy planning for the party as a whole.
These changes partly reflect Mr Major's determination to reinvigorate his
top team. Some Tory MPs have pinned the blame for the party's problems -
particularly last year's ill-fated 'back-to-basics' policy - on Mrs Hogg's
former team.
Mr Blackwell, a Cambridge natural sciences graduate, comes to the job from
McKinsey and Company, the management consultancy. He was described by
friends as a free-market thinker with a social conscience.
The government is planning to stage a large conference next year
highlighting Britain's role in world affairs.
Both Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, are said to be
taking a close interest in the planned event which will mark the 75th
anniversary of Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Britain to stop funding OECD research group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Britain is withdrawing from part of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development's research programme as a signal of its growing
unease with the organisation's overspending.
The decision to withdraw from the OECD's Development Centre was communicated
to the organisation last Friday by Mr Keith MacInnes, the British
ambassador, in a statement which clearly reflected a rift between the UK and
the OECD over budget control.
The move also seems likely to fuel concern about the future direction and
funding of the OECD, which represents 25 leading industrial nations, as it
seeks to expand into new areas and take on more members.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD's secretary-general yesterday said: 'I am
surprised by this (decision) - it came out of the blue. Britain had been one
of the strongest supporters of the centre.'
The UK will withdraw in 1996 the FFr3m (Pounds 355,000) funding it provides
to the centre, which carries out research into third world issues and builds
links with countries such as China.
Mr MacInnes told the OECD that the UK was prepared 'with reluctance' to join
a consensus about the OECD's latest proposal for its overall budget, which
was agreed in Paris last week. This has been set above the French inflation
rate and follows a growth in the organisation's budgets of nearly 40 per
cent in cash terms over the past four years.
Mr MacInnes contrasted this with the 'the great efforts' being made by the
UK government to restrain public expenditure, 'in step with principles
advocated by the OECD'.
He said: 'The increase in budgets of international organisations such as the
OECD causes us very real difficulty.'
A UK official said yesterday: 'We are making it clear that we are not happy
with the way OECD money has been spent.'
The UK contributes about 5 per cent of the Development Centre's annual
funding. The centre is a semi-autonomous wing of the OECD and its budget is
separate from the overall OECD budget.
Membership is voluntary for OECD members, but most support it as part of
their funding for the OECD.
British officials pointed out that the decision should be seen as part of
broader cuts and reallocation in the UK development budget.
However, OECD officials suggested that the move could be a retaliation for
the UK's defeat in its attempts to impose tighter controls on the overall
OECD budget.
The Development Centre said it was disappointed by the decision and warned
it would probably reduce its employment of British consultants as well as
research into areas of interest to Britain.

<TEXT>
Deals by Citibank and Land Securities, and now institutional interest in a
Kuwait Investment Organisation portfolio, have shattered the silence of an
inactive property market. They have also given some impetus to a recovery in
what has been the worst performing sector in the stock market this year.
Nevertheless, investors should not brace themselves for a rerun of 1993,
when the property sector climbed 80 per cent. Recent sales have reflected an
acceptance of lower prices, rather than an improving market. And there is
still no sign of the supposed Pounds 10bn that property agents claimed was
waiting to pour into UK property earlier this year.
However, there are positive signs. Rental growth of 4 per cent should be
achievable next year, and this will feed through into property prices. The
situation should also be helped by a return, albeit subdued, of the property
developer. This removes further supply from the market in the short term. In
the face of gradually rising property values, the sector's 20 per cent
discount to asset value should therefore start to dissipate. This does not
translate into a bull market: portfolio management will be the key to
increasing asset values in a low-inflation environment. Performance within
the sector will therefore be disparate, but at least the trend should start
to turn positive.

The rise in Glaxo's share price since Monday is truly astonishing. The stock
is up 7 per cent and its market capitalisation by Pounds 1.8bn. The
rationale is supposed to be the impact of a provision in Gatt that could
extend by 19 months the patent life of Zantac, Glaxo's biggest drug, in the
US, its biggest market.
The market's euphoria is premature. The Gatt provision allows generic
equivalents to be sold during the period if the manufacturers make
substantial investments before June 8 next year and if they pay the original
manufacturer a licence fee. In any case, the shares' increase is out of
proportion to any potential additional revenue, estimated at between Pounds
500m and Pounds 900m. The accompanying, though smaller, rise in other drugs
stocks is equally bizarre. Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham are not affected
by Gatt, and Zeneca only marginally. Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 3 per cent,
may benefit from a limited extension to its largest product's patents. But
for most other companies, the benefits, if any, will not be until the next
century, well beyond the market's normal time horizon.

<TEXT>
The Milan equity market's recovery this week appears perverse. Collapsing
governments normally engender the sort of instability disliked by investors.
But Mr Berlusconi's coalition has been so disastrous that any prospect of
change is being viewed as positive. The government's initial inability to
govern could have been excused by inexperience. But it became increasingly
apparent the three coalition parties were incompatible. The coalition's
collapse would therefore eradicate instability.
Foreign investors, heartened by political developments, have driven the
market's 7.5 per cent rise in the past week. They believe Italian equities
represent good value. After all, the market has fallen 18 per cent over the
last quarter and the lira is at an all time low against the D-Mark. They
also stress the strength of the economy and corporate earnings growth. And
they argue further devaluations of the lira can be offset by picking
industrial stocks generating a high proportion of profits outside Italy.
Such arguments carry weight. However, investors should not overlook the
political dangers. Attempts to form a government led by a non-partisan prime
minister will be long and complicated. Elections during the first half of
next year are probably inevitable. Italian equity markets will retain their
traditional volatility.

The drop in capacity at Lloyd's of London from Pounds 10.9bn to Pounds 10bn
for next year is not as big as could have been hoped for. The market is now
operating at excess capacity, increasing the temptation for Lloyd's
underwriters to take on poor quality business. But Lloyd's faces bigger
problems. Litigation hangs over the market and plans to hive off pre-1985
risks to Equitas, a company due to be formed to take over such long-tail
business, are fraught with difficulty. The exodus of individual names, which
are down 16 per cent for next year, is set to continue: the suspicion is
that many are waiting for Equitas to be established before quitting the
market. Lloyd's will be obliged to attract capital from corporate investors
in order to survive. Whether it can do this remains an open question. That
the years 1993 to 1995 are set to be profitable will make things easier, but
profits for 1993 will not be reported until 1996.

FT  22 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Halifax's direct hit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cracks in the masonry of the personal insurance market are widening.
First came the successful assault by the direct telephone-based insurers on
motor business. Now, Halifax building society has launched what looks like a
pre-emptive strike to stop the direct insurers from making significant
inroads into the lucrative buildings insurance market. The society's 20 per
cent across the board cut in premiums in this sector is set to trigger a new
price war.
The main sufferers of intensified price competition will not be the building
societies or others which merely distribute policies but the composite
insurers which earn a fat proportion of profits from underwriting personal
insurance business. Sun Alliance has the most to lose, as it provides the
bulk of Halifax's buildings policies. Its shares fell more sharply than
those of other composites yesterday, but all will suffer. Buildings
insurance is currently luxuriantly profitable - a 25 per cent pre-tax return
on premium income is not unusual. Add in investment income and the return on
capital can be more than 50 per cent. The insurance industry's long lead
times mean it will take several years for lower premiums to feed through to
reduced profits. But the move confirms investors' scepticism about the
quality and sustainability of insurers' underwriting profits. The sharp
underperformance of insurance shares in the past year is set to continue.

FT  22 DEC 94 / A model in need of overhaul: UK privatisation policy,
admired internationally, is under fire at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade after the flotation of British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, the
German state-owned monopoly, is lumbering towards the stock market. The
DM15bn Telekom sale, one of the largest in the world, reflects the eagerness
with which much of Europe and Asia is now embracing the UK model of
privatisation.
The transfer of state companies to the private sector, widely regarded as
the essence of Thatcherism, remains one of the UK's most popular exports.
The collapse of communism, which shook faith in the virtues of state
ownership, has helped its international propagation.
But in the UK, where sales of state-owned companies have raised nearly
Pounds 60bn for the government since 1980, the philosophy is under attack.
Customers of the privatised utilities feel that shareholders have been the
real winners, with sharp rises in profits and dividends. That grievance has
been deepened by steep hikes in directors' pay, notably the 75 per cent rise
awarded last month to Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive.
In the face of public and backbench criticism of privatised utilities, the
government has recently shelved proposed sales of the Forestry Commission,
Scottish water, and the Post Office. It is under increasing pressure to
demonstrate that past privatisations have delivered the promised benefits.
Some privatisations are now less controversial - including British Steel,
British Airways, the Rover car-maker and Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecoms
group. These all face competition in their markets, and have greatly
improved their performance (while many of their international rivals are
loss-making).
However it is on the performance of the utilities - telecommunications, gas,
electricity and water - that privatisation is judged by the British public.
With some or all of their businesses effectively monopolies, they have not
faced competitive pressures in the private sector. The UK privatisation
model relies on independent regulators to curb their monopoly power and
encourage economic efficiency through price controls. These controls have
taken the form of capping annual price rises according to a formula linked
to the retail price index (RPI); in most cases, these are 'RPI-X' formulae
that hold rises below the rate of inflation.
Of the four, British Telecom provides the most convincing case that the UK
model works. A decade ago, BT warned 250,000 customers waiting for new
telephone lines that it would not even suggest an installation date; now, it
says it will install a new residential line within 48 hours. Before
privatisation, telephones had to be rented from BT; now there are hundreds
of models on sale in shops.
Since 1984, the price of calls has also dropped by an average 40 per cent in
real terms. Meanwhile, turnover has doubled to Pounds 13.8bn in the year to
March 1994; the 90,000 fall in staff numbers to 150,000 has allowed pre-tax
profits to treble to Pounds 2.8bn.
The spur has been competition, largely from Mercury, the Cable &amp; Wireless
subsidiary, as well as technological change and the price controls. But
growth of competition was slower than expected, with some would-be rivals
arguing that they were inhibited by the terms of access to BT's network.
Privatising electricity presented greater challenges, in the absence of
competition in the industry. Radical structural reform during the sale
separated transmission and generation. The 12 regional electricity companies
(Recs) that supply power to consumers were allowed to compete in generation,
to a limited degree.
That competition, together with price capping imposed by the regulator, has
caused staff numbers and operating costs to fall sharply. But Mr Dieter
Helm, director of Oxera, the forecasting group, argues that the savings
should have been greater since the price of coal, gas, oil and uranium has
fallen since privatisation. 'There is little evidence to show that customers
are much better off,' he says.
Moreover, the industry's restructuring proved unexpectedly controversial
when it triggered a 'dash for gas', as generators built power stations using
cheaper gas to replace coal as a fuel. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the
electricity regulator, backed the switch on the grounds that it cut costs
and increased competition in power generation. But it also hastened the
decline of the coal industry, creating a row over pit closures that harmed
the image of privatisation.
Despite those concerns, the restructuring of the electricity industry has
spared its regulator many of the problems that have confronted his
counterpart in gas. The government chose to privatise British Gas with an
intact monopoly in transportation and supply of gas. The company was also
the only UK buyer of gas from producers. While it has been forced to cut gas
prices for smaller customers, initially it faced no price cap in the market
for larger customers.
The light regulation and unchanged structure were heavily criticised at the
time of privatisation. Professor John Vickers, an Oxford economist, says the
price controls on British Gas required 'lower productivity gains than those
British Gas had previously achieved while in public ownership'.*
The government has since introduced curbs on British Gas, including limits
on its market share and a requirement to sell gas to competitors to allow
them to supply customers. But these fall short of the changes recommended by
the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which
have both criticised the terms on which competitors can gain access to the
British Gas network to deliver their gas to customers.
The problems of gas regulation dwindle, however, when set beside those of
water where it is impossible to introduce direct competition without
creating competing networks of water pipes. The weight placed on the
regulator to curb abuse of this monopoly is consequently higher.
A complication in his task is that companies have embarked on a Pounds 40bn
capital spending programme, to modernise pipes and sewage plants after
decades of under-investment and to enable the the UK to comply with European
environmental directives. Under the price formula set at privatisation, the
costs are passed onto customers, and have pushed bills up by 5 per cent a
year above inflation since 1989.
Mr Ian Byatt, the water regulator, has criticised the Brussels standards,
particularly those on drinking water, for being unnecessarily tough. He has
also attempted to lighten the consumer's burden by restraining real price
increases for the next 10 years to an average of 1 per cent. But as
Professor Colin Mayer, an Oxford economist, comments, it has 'been
difficult' for the regulator to determine the industry's cost of capital and
to compare companies' efficiency. 'There are no easy answers', he adds.
The mixed record of utility regulation indicates that insufficient ambition
in creating competition when privatising utilities creates a troublesome
legacy for the regulators - even if it helps sell the shares. As Prof
Littlechild says: 'However well-intentioned and well-informed price control
(is), effective competition is better.'
Prof Littlechild originally believed that regulators would be able to
introduce enough competition to allow regulation to wither away. However, as
Prof Vickers argues, it is 'over-optimistic to view regulation as a stopgap
until sufficient competition arrives'.
In his view, the regulatory framework and pricing formula have 'so far
survived reasonably well'. In recent reviews, regulators have tightened the
price curbs, helping customers, at shareholders' expense (although they have
satisfied neither customers nor companies).
But problems remain. In particular, the terms on which competitors use the
telecommunications, gas and electricity networks are hotly disputed. As
Professor John Kay of London Economics, the consultancy, says, in the
context of telecoms: 'It has been evident since the first stirrings of
competition . . . that the terms on which entrants would be allowed access
to the incumbent's network were critical'.
It is clear that inadequate attention to such problems at the time of
privatisation is the cause of many of the complaints about the privatised
utilities. The forthcoming privatisation of British Rail is the next chance
for the government to show whether it has learned that lesson.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Time to debate worker rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's UK government climbdown on the matter of part-time worker rights
raises two important worries. The first concerns the ruling itself, which
may imply short-term adjustment costs for both employees and employers. A
much larger concern, however, relates to the way the regime-change came
about, and the government's unduly negative approach to the question of
worker rights.
Uncertainty about future regulatory changes distorts employment decisions
more than the changes announced to parliament on Tuesday. Recent changes in
the structure of employment have made the UK labour market more flexible,
but they have also bred understandable fears about job security and
equitable treatment of employees. The country urgently needs a constructive
debate about the framework of worker rights, which could make the two
demands - flexibility and fairness - more visibly compatible. Neither the
government's resistance to part-time rights, nor back-door legislation by
the law lords, provides a worthy substitute.
Granting redundancy, unfair dismissal and other statutory rights to all
part-time workers who have been employed for over two years may have
negative effects for part-time workers. Some argue that companies,
especially small ones, will now decide to employ, say, one full-time worker
instead of two part-timers, because employing the latter is no longer as
advantageous. Ironically enough, this would hit women hardest, although it
was a case brought against the government by the Equal Opportunities
Commission that triggered the Law Lords Ruling in the first place.
Legitimate worry
There is a legitimate worry here, but it can be over done. The only workers
who will be immediately affected will be those who have worked at the same
company for more than two years but fewer than five. This represents only
about 750,000 of the UK's 6.5m part-time workers. Many of the remainder
already enjoy equal treatment. This is either because they have put in the
five years previously required for those working 8-16 hours, or because they
work for one of the growing number of employers who have voluntarily opted
to treat part-time and full-time workers more equitably.
These considerations may partly explain why the Confederation of British
Industry and many employers have greeted the ruling with more equanimity
than the government. Another explanation would be that the two-year
eligibility requirement provides a way to avoid these restrictions.
Greater flexibility
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment minister, made clear on Tuesday that the
government resented being forced to change tack. Excessive regulation, he
argued, threatened to undo the greater flexibility achieved in the UK labour
market in recent years.
Part-time work may, for many companies, be a way of improving their
efficiency. But, as long as there are arbitrary legal and tax distinctions
between part- and full-time workers, it will be impossible to judge how far
part-time work represents greater flexibility, and how far it is a response
to regulatory distortions. The proportion of part-time female employees
working fewer than 16 hours a week rose by about a third between 1979 and
1990: the fact that these very low-hour jobs have grown considerably faster
than part-time work overall may owe much to their different fiscal and
regulatory treatment.
Mr Portillo is right that Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome is an
inappropriate instrument for wide-scale changes to UK labour legislation.
The notion of indirect discrimination does have disturbing ramifications.
For all that, it is a pity that the government decided to use the ruling as
an excuse to win political points with Conservative Euro-sceptics rather
than as an opportunity to lay out a more positive approach.
A workable framework of employee rights will not be achieved while the
debate is polarised between extreme 'deregulators' and supporters of
all-encompassing regulations. The lack of a 'feel-good' factor in the
recovery so far owes much to the unease felt by those whose terms of
employment are changing. Such insecurities need to be addressed.

Nor did the left-leaning Guardian escape. Its chief political hack Michael

Nice idea. Eurotunnel yesterday took to the UK press to advertise today's
opening of Le Shuttle. While the Guardian had to be different, publishing a
page from that day's Le Figaro, the other newspapers carried a page of
specially commissioned articles by an ex-Figaro journalist.
If readers felt the French was a bit beyond them, they were in good company.
'Nobody was meant to understand the French itself,' said commercial director
Christopher Garnett. The point was to catch people's attention - with a nice
simple, English message on the opposite page. Eurotunnel was initially
adamant, though, that the articles were entirely serious.
Ah, so the company knows all about the Association of Investigative
Journalists that is campaigning for public figures to disclose their wealth
at the beginning and end of their terms of office? And the Committee for the
Preservation of Parisian Brasseries which is quoted opining on the subject
of the soaring price of espresso coffee? Eurotunnel's promotion people
should look again at the article about Asterix's 35th birthday, signed by
one Bertrand Pigeon - which translates not only as pigeon, but also mug or
sucker.

Few of the names in the cabinet-in-waiting of Brazilian president-elect
Fernando Henrique Cardoso ring many bells outside the upper reaches of the
Amazon, least of all that of the new 54-year-old secretary for sport, Edson
Arantes do Nascimento.
His family call him Dico, but most know him as Pele, probably still the
world's most famous sportsman. Pele hasn't kicked a ball in earnest since
October 1977, when in New Jersey he appeared both for New York Cosmos and
his long-standing Brazilian club, Santos.
But Cardoso clearly has other reasons than soccer for giving Pele a
government post. Next year will be another shaky one for Brazil's economy,
so Cardoso will be grateful to have at least one public official whose
salary won't be a crucial issue. Pele is Croesus-rich, this year alone
raking in an estimated Pounds 15m from product endorsement deals from
companies such as Pizza Hut and Mastercard. His business interests include
dairy and fish farms, as well as a radio station.
Maybe that's why Cardoso chose him - to bankroll his fellow government
ministers. 'Edson - can you spare me a moment tomorrow to discuss the
national debt crisis . . . ?'

Don't fancy John Olsen's chances of remaining at the helm of Cunard,
Trafalgar House's ritzy shipping company. The bungled refit of Cunard's QE2,
flagship of Britain's merchant navy, has tarnished the image of the world's
greatest liner and also raised serious questions about the competence of
Trafalgar House's new top team.
It's no use blaming seasick plumbers for the delays. Refurbishing an elderly
liner is just as tricky as renovating a stately home - you don't know what
the problems are until you start taking it to bits. Cunard's original
timetable was far too tight and its response to the inevitable public
relations' crisis far too slow.
The fiasco is particularly embarrassing for Trafalgar House, which wants to
take over Northern Electric and which it says it can run more efficiently
while encouraging an 'increasingly commercial culture'. Tell that to the QE2
passengers left behind.
Nor has Nigel Rich, Trafalgar House's new chief executive, set much of an
example. He didn't start work until mid-August - 10 months after being
selected. Such a lengthy management hand-over may be acceptable in a
smoothly functioning corporation - but not in a company with Trafalgar's
problems.
Olsen, an airline man who jetted in to Trafalgar House from Cathay Pacific
after a brief stop-over at Dan Air, was one of the first board appointments
made by Trafalgar House's new chairman, Simon Keswick. His new boys would be
better advised to put their own house in order before they start telling
others how to run a business.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Personal View: Real target behind Bundesbank ritual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BOFINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty years ago, on December 5 1974, the Bundesbank was the first central
bank in the world to announce a monetary target. Many central banks followed
this example, but sooner or later they have all learned that, while the
money supply is an important indicator, it is not suitable as the guiding
star of monetary policy.
Germany, however, continues to think otherwise. Indeed this year, the
members of the Bundesbank's Central Bank Council have used any opportunity
to defend monetary targets as a cornerstone of German 'stability culture'.
So it is almost certain that at its meeting today the council will announce
its 21st monetary target.
This lasting devotion to monetarism is difficult to reconcile with the
German experience of monetary targeting over the last two decades:
Of the 20 targets set between 1975 and 1994, the Bundesbank achieved only
10.
The deviations from the targets were not random. In all cases where the
target was missed the money supply exceeded the target. The Bundesbank has
never attempted to compensate for over-expansion in one year by setting a
correspondingly lower target for the next year.
The relationship between M3 (the intermediate target for money supply) and
short-term interest rates (the instrument at the disposal of the Bundesbank)
has become quite unclear. For example, the Bundesbank increased short-term
rates to dampen monetary growth in 1992; it did just the opposite in 1994.
The target aggregate, the money supply M3, less and less reflects the actual
money holdings of German companies and households. It not only excludes the
strongly growing money market funds but also D-Mark Euro-deposits which
amount to almost 50 per cent of traditional short-term time deposits. In
fact, it is only because of shifts in new financial instruments that the
monetary target for 1994 could formally be met.
With this 'pragmatic' use of its monetary targeting, it seems hardly
possible that the Bundesbank should have acquired such a high degree of
credibility. Obviously, the Bundesbank's approach must contain something
more important than its monetary target.
This decisive factor is not difficult to identify. It is the bank's clear
commitment to a low inflation rate. In other words, the Bundesbank's policy
is a typical - and also successful - example of a strategy that is now
called 'inflation targeting':
Together with its monetary target, the Bundesbank has for many years also
announced a target inflation rate of 2 per cent a year.
Short-term interest rates, the Bundesbank's monetary policy instrument, have
mainly been geared towards expected trends in consumer price inflation. For
instance, since autumn 1992, the main justification for lowering key
interest rates was the better prospects for price stability.
The famous 'long and variable lag' between the implementation of monetary
policy and its impact entails the risk of setting rates too high or too low.
It is at this point that credibility comes in. If a central bank's
commitment to price stability is credible, trade unions will incorporate the
inflation target in their wage setting.
Under such conditions, it is not too difficult for the central bank to
achieve its target. If credibility is in danger, the problem of lags forces
a central bank to be overly restrictive to ensure the inflation target can
be met. This use of interest rates under a regime of 'inflation targeting'
explains the very restrictive policy stance of the Bundesbank until the
autumn of 1992.
Thus, in reality there is only a small conceptual difference between
monetary policy in Germany and in the US and UK, two countries that openly
practise 'inflation targeting'. The recent interest rate reactions of the
Bank of England and the Federal Reserve to early signs of inflationary
pressures show that these two central banks are now also trying to maintain
and enhance their credibility by copying the Bundesbank's approach.
So what about the monetary target? Advent is a period with many old rituals.
If the Bundesbank likes the little annual ceremony of announcing a monetary
target, one should not criticise it. But behind the rituals the real world
should not be forgotten - especially in 1995, when the conceptual design of
the European Central Bank's monetary policy has to be developed.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Right decision, wrong tactics
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Mexican government's decision to allow the peso to devalue was correct
from an economic standpoint but, as the panic in Mexico's financial markets
yesterday illustrated, one it handled unnecessarily badly. All governments
suffer credibility crises following devaluations, but the Mexican
government's tactics before and after Tuesday's currency move have increased
the damage.
The message the markets are sending the new administration of President
Ernesto Zedillo is that further adjustments to economic policy are necessary
to ensure the gains from currency depreciation are not frittered away. It
will take much more than this one step for the economy to be freed from its
straitjacket of slow growth.
Tactically, the government would have done better to give the peso room for
a larger devaluation to make its new floor more easily defensible. More
fundamentally, investors were seeking a government commitment to act
forcefully to curb the current account deficit that is their central
concern. Instead, they were fed a series of government statements which
blamed the devaluation on 'temporary' political factors.
Like other governments in Latin America, the Mexican government was forced
in the late 1980s - by the complete absence of credibility in fiscal and
monetary policy over many years - to use the exchange rate as its principal
weapon in the battle against inflation. In the six years of the
administration of President Carlos Salinas, the credibility of fiscal and
monetary policy was substantially enhanced. However, he has bequeathed to
his successor a substantially overvalued currency and an economy locked into
a cycle of high interest rates and slow growth. The current account deficit
had grown to 8 per cent of gross domestic product, which had to be financed
by capital from abroad.
Virility symbol
With the tense stand-off between peasant rebels and the Mexican army
continuing in the southern state of Chiapas, investors had been pulling
their money out of the country, despite the high interest rates on offer.
The strong exchange rate had become more of an economic virility symbol than
a helpful policy tool.
At a level of four to the dollar, the peso appears now more or less
appropriately valued. The government's first task is to reassure financial
markets that this is the case. It must ensure that the devaluation does not
feed, via wage pressure, into inflation, which would erode the competitive
gains resulting from the devaluation.
The government has secured an agreement with business leaders and trade
unions - under the so-called pacto - to limit wage increases to 4 per cent
in the coming year. This should help to keep inflationary pressures under
control during this transitional period. The government also needs to send a
clear message of its intention to tackle more directly the roots of the
current account deficit, which will remain uncomfortably high for some time
to come despite the devaluation.
Domestic savings
The deficit is a reflection of the weak level of domestic savings, which
entails a heavy reliance on foreign savings to sustain investment and
promote growth. Because the main savers in Mexico are companies rather than
private individuals, a devaluation whose consequences, over time, should
increase company profit margins can help to raise the domestic savings rate.
In the meantime, the government must announce credible plans to increase its
own savings - by enlarging the budget surplus.
The government also needs to spell out its intention to remove the many
remaining obstacles to Mexican competitiveness. Economic reform in the past
10 years has been extensive, but inadequate to clear the path for adequate
growth. Deregulation needs to go much further and faster. The judicial
reform announced by the president must be vigorously pursued to provide
business with confidence in the rule of law and the sanctity of contracts.
The government also needs to move further on privatisation. The clearest
signal it could offer would be to announce plans to privatise the
inefficient state-run electricity and energy monopolies. Were it to do so,
the markets might begin to revise their hitherto unfavourable view of this
week's events.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The follies of the macho manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have not been able to find the Biblical adage which says that your 'yea'
should be a 'yea' and your 'nay' a 'nay'. In any case it apparently forms
little part in the training of the English businessman.
This omission is the focus of the first article in the January 1995 issue,
now available, of Business Ethics.* The author, Malene Djursaa, has carried
out 55 interviews (in depth of course) in recent research on cultural
factors in Anglo-Danish business relations.
She places the findings in the framework of low-context and high-context
cultures. In low-context cultures, information is explicit and 'vested in
words of precise and unambiguous meanings'. Low-context people predominate
in the US, Germany, Switzerland and Scandinavia. What such cultures lack in
subtlety, they gain in precision. A low-context person is to the point and
may even 'over-inform'.
By contrast, high-context cultures rely on implicit communications 'vested
in shared experience and assumptions and conveyed through verbal and
non-verbal codes'. Well-known high-context cultures are the Japanese and the
Arabian. Professor Djursaa's point is that English business practices are
nearer the Japanese and Arabic models than generally supposed.
For instance, a Danish paint manufacturing company wanted a large English
firm to represent it in Britain. Having received encouraging signals on a
first visit, the Danish managers came over a second time and were surprised
by the complete lack of interest. Yet they were still not turned down. The
British 'no' was finally received in a telex of three lines after a total of
three visits and much wasted advance planning from the Danish end. Why
didn't the English say 'no' at the start?
                            *       *       *
This is all great fun and contains a moral. But I doubt, however, if it
should be dignified by the title of business ethics. Indeed I doubt the
existence of business ethics as a subject. If I ever write another book
after the one due to come out early in the new year, it will not be on
business ethics, but on modern managerialism.
The central slogans of modern managerialism consist of words such as
'down-sizing' and other terms which mean closures and sackings. These are
occasionally necessary, as economic progress can take the form of
substituting new jobs for old. But the knee-jerk new-style managers regard
cutting staff as a sign of virility and do not have the imagination to ask
whether it might pay them to take on more workers at modest rates of pay.
Hence the idiotic snubs with which some business organisations treated the
employment incentives in last month's UK Budget.
Much of this modern managerialism is based on the simple fallacy that labour
is the scarce factor of production. Yet the signs are all around us that
labour is now plentiful in the English-speaking countries and much cheaper
in real terms than it used to be. If you add the non-employed to the
registered unemployed, you get a very large reserve army indeed - many of
whom would be admirably suited to the tasks given over to computers. The
macho-managers who want to save labour, above all, are responding to a
historical situation of overpriced labour which no longer exists or is fast
disappearing - despite the efforts of the European Commission and the UK law
lords to bring it back.
A proper study will have to separate the wheat from the chaff in modern
management. It will have to explain how well-intentioned reforms of health
and education have led to professionals spending half their waking hours
writing reports to uncomprehending accountants. Let me content myself with a
few trivial but tell-tale manifestations.
The most superficial manifestation is the flip-chart, which is basically
only a modern version of the school blackboard, but on which slogans and
platitudes of the most astounding banality are written. Organisations that
like flip-charts normally invite one to give 'presentations' rather than
talks or lectures.
A proper study will have to cover some of the follies appearing in the early
stages of rail privatisation. A small but revealing example is the
disappearance of the useful pamphlet on British Rail Inter-City services.
Previously you could get it at any main station. This year I was told that I
had to apply for it in writing; and still it has not materialised.
Only a mad managerialist could think of dividing the rail network into
dozens and dozens of separate groups for privatisation. The whole point of a
transport network is to get you from one part of the country to another. So
extreme decentralisation makes no sense. Indeed the network will have to be
recreated through interchangeable tickets and dovetailed timetables, all
involving much time, effort and negotiation, and inconvenience to the
traveller.
A primary feature of modern managerialism is that, despite all the
advantages of computerised information that the organisation has, the
individual customer sitting amid the confusion of his own home is meant to
do all the work. Computerised reminders of charges or appeals for funds come
from businesses and charities alike. But their compilers have not even had
the courtesy to check whether the recipient has already paid, or has signed
a debit instruction. For that would involve the bother of an individual (or
as they would say 'individualised') letter which would be beyond the ken of
the management expert.
One of the main features of computerised communication is that it is not
really efficient or cost-saving. My own bank discovered this when I was sent
extremely unpleasant threats for the non-payment of a trivial sum of money
on a credit card which I had not in fact used. But the frustrating thing
about a computer is that there is no one at the other end; and if you do not
comply with precise and often misconceived instructions, ever-more
threatening letters will emerge at prescribed intervals.
Minor manifestations of managerialism occur in the expressions that
modern-minded companies tell their employees to use. How many telephone
calls have you had answered by 'How can I help you?' in a not very helpful
voice? If you come in person you are told to 'take a seat' - usually a low
couch from which it is difficult to rise and where you are made to sit out
of harm's way until they are ready to deal with you. Such forms of words
combine a superficial courtesy with the reality of a put-down. It almost
makes me prefer the older expression 'he's in a meeting', designed to make
all communication impossible.
A new horror consists of voice mail. The old telephone answering machine,
which simply recorded a message if someone was not in or was too busy, was
very useful. But now before you can even leave a message you have to hold on
for about 10 minutes while a large number of alternative options are read
out; and you have to wait for a tone at the end of it all which is sometimes
inaudible. It is very tempting to use all one's guile to find a non-listed
telephone number on which a human being will actually reply.
Lesser examples of modern management include the replacement of tea-trolleys
by machines which give a very restricted choice and are often jammed. The
waste of highly-paid employees' time in trying to get these compartments to
disgorge their contents far outweighs the payment of a part-time lady.
We are told that we live in an information age where the most valuable
commodity is information. In fact most of the people who talk about this
revolution are interested only in the technical means of communication and
have not the faintest idea of what it is they wish to communicate.

FT  22 DEC 94 / World in a box: The explosive growth in television viewing
in China - The Power of Communication
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a winter's night in Beijing and light snow is sprinkling the window
ledges of a worker's dormitory near the city centre, but for the Ma family
this is perfect television viewing weather.
For Mr Ma, a worker in a car factory, his retired wife and 24-year-old son,
bliss these days is viewing the three colour TV sets in their modest
two-bedroom apartment - fed by a satellite dish on the balcony and
fibre-optic cable.
The Mas, who bought their first TV, a locally-made black-and-white set, in
1979, never expected the world outside China to be opened to them as it has
been by satellite and cable television. Mr Ma is still shaking his head in
wonderment at the spectacle of bungee jumping which he saw for the first
time a few nights previously.
'Never in my wildest dreams did I expect that we would have three TV sets
and access to such a wide choice of programmes,' says Mrs Ma, who admits a
preference for sentimental Hong Kong soap operas.
Mr Ma, on the other hand, favours Beijing opera whose peculiar cadences are
not to everybody's taste - which is why, his wife jokes, the family requires
more than one television set.
Ma junior is a soccer aficionado and can indulge his preference on the
24-hour-a-day sport channel broadcast by Mr Rupert Murdoch's Hong Kong-based
Star TV via Asia-Sat 1.
China's communications revolution is in full swing, although official
resistance to the spread of satellite dishes and stricter controls on cable
programming mean dissemination of services remains a murky business.
In October last year, the state council, or China's cabinet, issued
Proclamation 129, which repeated the government's ban on receiving direct
foreign broadcasts and imposed severe restrictions on ownership of satellite
dishes.
The Chinese authorities, made nervous by a flood of uncontrolled
information, targeted foreign news broadcasts in particular, including the
BBC's, which often carry items critical of Beijing on issues such as human
rights.
At her home in Beijing's western suburbs, Mrs Zhong, a university teacher,
flips through the dozen or so cable channels showing their mixture of
cartoons, local news and soap operas before stopping at a static-filled
screen. 'That's where the BBC used to be,' she says ruefully.
The Zhong family used to receive the BBC, and also CNN, via a large communal
satellite dish in their residential compound but, after the state council
ban, the service ceased. The Zhongs must now rely solely on cable
programming from the government-owned Beijing Cable TV Station.
For them, much of the cable programming seems rather mindless, with a heavy
diet of Hong Kong and Taiwanese soap operas and kung fu movies. 'The
government learnt a lesson after 1989 (the Tiananmen square pro-democracy
agitation) and now seems intent on numbing people's political awareness,'
says Mrs Zhong.
Cable services are spreading rapidly and are available to more than 10 per
cent of households with television sets. Some 600 cable systems have been
licensed in China, many operated by large institutions for their employees,
to relay government-approved programmes that avoid the salacious and
politically-incorrect.
But for lucky families like the Mas, who had installed their satellite dish
or wok (the dishes are likened to the Chinese cooking vessel) before the
state council ban, the choice is much wider via Asia-Sat 1. Available
services include five Star-TV channels, plus regional services from as far
away as Yunnan in southern China. 'People envy us,' says Mrs Ma. 'We can
receive more than a dozen channels on satellite, and that is on top of the
channels available on cable. Before we bought a satellite dish, we thought
of renovating the house, but we bought a dish instead.'
The Mas paid Yn3,000 (Dollars 350) for their dish 'through a relative'.
Prices range between Yn3,000 and Yn10,000. A cable service costs households
Yn8 per month, or less than Dollars 1
Mr Li Hong, manager of the marketing department of Beijing Cable TV Station,
says that in Beijing there are 700,000 subscribers (about one in five
households) and he expects Beijing subscribers to number 1m next year.
Despite the ban on satellite dishes, production continues at a number of
factories in the capital, including Factory No 701, a former defence
industries plant now owned by Beijing municipality.
A sales manager said that, while production had been harmed by the ban, the
factory was still in business, selling woks to people in remote areas to
improve their access to government-run TV. City people and work units were
also finding ways round the ban so there was a steady demand for dishes.
Business in the longer run holds enormous promise for foreign and domestic
companies involved in delivering programmes and technical services to
China's hundreds of millions of television viewers, but a nervous government
seems set to keep the brakes on for the time being.
This has not prevented the continued spread of television, which has found
its way into the vast majority of Chinese households. According to a recent
survey by the People's Daily newspaper, 96 per cent of all urban households
owned either a colour or black-and-white set, while the figure for rural
areas was 48.5 per cent.
China is the world's biggest producer of black-and-white TVs and the third
biggest producer of colour sets behind South Korea and the US.
With multi-set families like the Mas setting a trend, it would seem that
domestic demand for colour sets will continue to rise. Mrs Ma herself could
hardly be a better advertisement for the new television age. 'Television has
changed our lives,' she says. 'It was boring before when we did not have TV,
but life has now become more colourful.'

<TEXT>
Sir, As customers of Northern Electric we quake at the prospect that it may
eventually be taken over by Trafalgar House, or indeed by some other
company.
This reaction is open to misinterpretation. It does not stem from any
fondness for Northern Electric - in fact, the electricity regulator, Offer,
has judged Northern Electric to have been overly successful among the
regional electricity companies in relieving customers of their money - but
rather from the thought of yet another layer of overheads to be paid for by
the captive Northern Electric customers.
In this year of all years, in which Offer has so comprehensively
demonstrated its ineffectiveness, who can possibly imagine that it could
stop Trafalgar House from loading extra costs on to Northern Electric - an
apportionment of Trafalgar House board costs, the costs of feeding the lions
in Trafalgar Square, etc etc?

FT  22 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Attraction of jobs for life should be
examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDY LAKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Peter Robinson, of the London School of Economics' Centre for Economic
Performance, welcomes (Letters, December 13) the 'nailing of the myth' that
jobs for life have become a thing of the past, as outlined by Simon Burgess
and Hedley Rees ('Jobs for life still available to many' December 9).
Would that it were as simple as that. Figures from the Labour Force Survey
in December's Employment Gazette paint a more complex picture. Comparisons
between 1984 and 1994 show that while the number of permanent jobs
(employees) has grown by 2 per cent, the number of temporary posts has grown
by 27 per cent. For men there has been a reduction of 6 per cent in the
number of permanent posts, and an increase of 38 per cent in the number of
temporary jobs.
One only has to look at a sector such as further and higher education to see
the impact of these changes. Not just yearly contracts, but term ones are
becoming the norm in some institutions. This does of course raise the
question of how many renewals of a temporary contract it takes for a
temporary job to become a permanent one?
During this period there has also been, as is well-known, a big rise in the
numbers of self-employed (23 per cent) and in part-time working (24 per
cent), particularly for men (69 per cent). Perhaps more profitable than a
debate about whether there are still 'jobs for life' to be found (implying
that that is intrinsically desirable) would be to look at the massive growth
in jobs which are part-time, temporary, home-based or flexible in some way,
and their potential for good or ill.
Some three-fifths of new jobs are believed to fall into the 'flexible'
category. Often, such forms of employment offer advantages which compensate
for the attendant lack of job security.
But what policy-makers, employers and providers of financial services need
to examine are the reasons why 'jobs for life' are attractive to people,
namely as the underpinning for housing, retirement, insurance and so on, and
develop a framework whereby people in more flexible forms of employment can
enjoy similar levels of security.
Addressing these concerns offers a more realistic approach to trends in the
jobs market than holding out false hopes that there will continue to be an
adequate supply of full-time, permanent posts to meet demand.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: No abuse by magistrates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From ANDREA LORENZO CAPUSSELA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I disagree entirely with Robert Graham's statement ('Curtain rises on
the final act', December 16) that the Milan magistrates 'have clearly abused
the rights of citizens in interrogations and in leaking documents to
discredit individuals'.
The existence of any abuse can be excluded as the magistrates' conduct has
been upheld in virtually all cases by the High Court, the Court of Appeal
and the Supreme Court.
As regards the leaks, many people have access to investigation documents:
magistrates, advocates, policemen and court bureaucrats. Any of them could
have passed the documents to the press, and to hold the magistrates
responsible for the leaks is a very radical proposition.
I suspect Robert Graham based his views on these matters solely on the
repeated slogans of Mr Berlusconi's supporters, which is at least a rather
unreliable source of information.

<TEXT>
Sir, The standing advisory committee on trunk road assessment (Sactra)
offers us a valuable insight in suggesting that new roads generate new
traffic ('Government to reassess plans for new roads', December 20). It is a
pity that the railway builders a century and a half ago did not refrain from
laying down new railway lines for fear that they might generate new economic
activity. Or, indeed, the canal builders in the 18th century.
Come to think of it, it is a pity that the same insight was not shared by
electronic engineers, chemists, pharmaceutical scientists, steel makers, oil
prospectors, or indeed the explorers of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mortgage element has a role in prices
index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID LEA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As he indicated in his article 'How to miss on the inflation target'
(December 19), since he joined the Retail Prices Index Advisory Committee
two and a half years ago Samuel Brittan has strongly advocated the removal
of mortgage interest payments from the index.
After reviewing all the arguments, including consideration of papers by
distinguished academics, the majority of the committee took the opposite
point of view, one factor being the unique role played by mortgage interest
payments in the structure of housing finance in Britain.
We are proposing to continue this, somewhat modified, to give greater weight
to new house prices.
In other words, Samuel Brittan lost the argument, partly because he refused
 -and still does - to address the strengths of the case for the mortgage
interest payments system.
The advisory committee has for many years been responsible for modifications
to the index - most recently, for example, designing a formula to cover
holidays abroad - and the index undoubtedly has very wide acceptance.
Unlike its equivalent in a number of OECD countries - and indeed unlike the
unemployment statistics in the UK (which are not reviewed by an advisory
committee such as the RPlAC) - the RPI has not been a source of political
controversy in Britain. Long may that remain so.
It is a fact of life that the RPI is used for a wide range of different
purposes. By a process akin the Darwinian survival of the fittest, it has
seen off other media inspired indices - just the sort of process which
Samuel Brittan would normally describe as the proper result of market
forces.

<TEXT>
VANYA ON 42ND STREET (U) Louis Malle
THE SPECIALIST (15) Luis Llosa
D2: THE MIGHTY DUCKS (U) Sam Weisman
Just what I always wanted] people cry - or are imagined to - when they open
their presents. But can we ever know what we want until we have it? Does not
a truly joyous surprise consist of something that we would have wanted, if
only we had known before we got it that it existed.
Deep questions. So here is a deep answer and your Christmas present for
1994: Louis Malle's Vanya On 42nd Street. We never thought we wanted Chekhov
like this: six or seven sub-famous actors dressed in their day clothes and
shuffling around a rehearsal space in a peeling, derelict New York theatre
under the gently deranged eye of avant-garde director Andre Gregory (playing
himself), as he watches the run-through with a bunch of friends.
Yet this workshop production ran, on and off, for four years. Only New York,
with such a miracle in its midst, could have been so philistine as not to
fund a full-dress commercial staging. But then that might have dissipated
the magic. Witnessed by Louis Malle's casual, handheld camera, the approach
of Andre Gregory - he was the title gourmet, you recall, in Malle's My
Dinner With Andre - is to let Chekhov grow right up from the floorboards.
After a gathering-of-the-company prelude, we watch actor Wallace Shawn (My
Dinner's co-gourmet) stretch out and go to sleep in the baroquely gutted
auditorium. Near him a conversation strikes up between two people: they seem
to be an old nanny and a medium-young doctor. Shawn wakes up. He is Vanya.
The doctor is Astrov (Larry Pyne); nanny is Nanny (Phoebe Brand); and the
rest of the cast soon flower forth, with no change of costume or mimetic
emphasis, from this dishevelled landfill of haphazard props, half-bits of
scenery (a cloth tree, a hint of sky) and yards of unstuck auditorium
stucco.
Starting from the unexpected, Gregory and Malle progress to the
messianically perverse. As the play unfolds in David Mamet's pithy,
pitch-perfect translation, we realise that every moment is being reinvented.
The prime tactic is to play against the surface message of the dialogue.
'Are you happy?' Sonya the ugly duckling stepdaughter (Brooke Smith) asks
the beautiful Yelena. 'No,' says Yelena, and her face splits wide with
silent, sharing laughter.
This is the hilarity of an excessive familiarity with despair: it infects
everyone in this household. Shawn's Vanya is a jester with the face of a
capuchin monkey and the mood swings of an emotional chimpanzee. From vine to
vine he leaps: purple with anger when we least expect, antic with
self-mockery when the lines seem to plead for high grief. Watch him explode
at that selfish sage Serebryakov (George Gaines), Yelena's grizzled
bridegroom. Then watch Vanya ridicule his own ruined passion on catching
Astrov clinch-deep in Yelena's arms.
That languorous beauty - in many stagings a piece of interior decor with no
interior - is played with dazzling intelligence by Julianne Moore (of
Altman's Short Cuts). She starts with the scarified look of a beauty whose
face has been stretched over an inner rack of misery. Then she adds insight
to injury. This Yelena is no self-absorbed society odalisque: but a woman
whose wit and awareness sculpt our own awareness of why life in this house
is hell on earth. (Mainly because it could have been, and so nearly was,
heaven on earth).
The production is mesmeric in small scenes, apocalyptic in large. In
Chekhov's plays, human beings are woven into a tapestry of intimacy designed
to thwart, madden and disappoint. In Gregory's vision, this grief is made
keener by constant hilarity. We realise why Chekhov called his plays
'comedies'. The big scene of the family conference - Serebryakov blithely
preparing to sign away the estate, Vanya tearing his own head in two at the
impudence of it - comes over like King Lear crossed with Fawlty Towers.
Absurd, momentous, giddy, agonising, all-encompassing.
Louis Malle films this sequence, like the whole production, the only way he
could. Without vainglory, without self-imposings; instead with a subtle
devotion to eight actors turning a modest, ill-equipped space into an entire
world of human emotion and experience, vitalised by a stage director's
creative contrariness. Utterly magical, utterly memorable.
Elsewhere, Britain's Christmas lives down to its usual standard. The
Specialist is two hours of Miami-set mayhem staring Sylvester Stallone.
Directed by Luis Llosa, a Latin American ex-critic on secondment to
Lotusland, the movie makes a simple plot seem like a Jorge Luis Borges
story. Not through sophisticated overlays of metaphor or metaphysics but
through sheer narrative incompetence.
Just who is chasing whom? Explosives expert Stallone is enmeshed with
mysterious beauty Sharon Stone who is somehow entangled with Sly's now
alienated ex-crony James Woods. Meanwhile all three make life difficult for
Cuban mafioso Rod Steiger. Surely unfair, this: is not Steiger's life
difficult enough already? He is struggling with a Spanish accent that he
seems to have won somewhere as a booby prize.
'Joo go out and joo find diss explosives ekthpert]' he hisses, or hithes, at
a henchman. Later his last words over a fatal exploding locket are a choked
but deafening 'Joo bastardo]]' Ah, the waterfronts and pawnbrokers of long
ago. The film itself seems so foolproof on paper. Leading muscleman actor
meets leading sexbomb actress with top character actors in support. But
Stallone and Stone make music only with their surnames. He is a drawl, a
dazed look and 200 pounds of oil-glazed muscle. She is Miss Basic Acting
Talent 1990s. Watching them try to strike amorous sparks in an all-nude love
scene under the shower  - clearly meant to be the erotic set-piece of the
season - is like watching two porpoises try to get it on in a rainstorm.
The only 'specialist' worthy of his name is Woods. He snaps, snarls,
twitches: but all with such controlled wit that he seems to know the movie
is a joke even while he plays it, honourably, for real.
The Specialist does not open until Boxing Day. So where to send your
children when they misbehave over Christmas? You have long given up sending
them to their bedrooms: the places are kitted out with enough computer
technology to amuse them till the year 2000.
Why not send them instead to D2: The Mighty Ducks? Here they will find
ordeal by ice hockey and torture by triumphalist schmaltz. For the second
time around Emilio Estevez leads his little-league skaters to all-American
victory. Crying, cheering, exulting: those are just some of the emotions you
will experience on being allowed to leave the cinema.
Sometimes it is better to read about films than to see them: for instance
when you have David Thomson's Biographical Dictionary Of Film. The BDF is
now out in a new updated edition and is the best of all personal-view
reference books. To read Thomson's adventurist hymns to such unlikely
pantheon-sharers as Bela Lugosi and Robert Bresson, Luis Bunuel and Victor
Mature - or to read Thomson's no less witty demolition jobs on Madonna or
Alec Baldwin - is to know that cinematic taste is not a simple matter; nor,
written about like this, is it a dull one. Your perfect Christmas gift for
your film-buff friend.

Sift through the nonsense on screen as the holiday looms and you can find
the odd serious offering. First Sight (7.30pm BBC2) is a timely look at the
drinks trade - from the other side of the law. Booze-running is big
business, as America found out during Prohibition; though our
Channel-leaping trippers loading up with the product of grape, grain and hop
have yet to resort to shoot-outs with the customs officers we see going
about their eagle-eyed calling.
More divided sympathies, more trouble in store awaiting the day of reckoning
in Channel 4's Witness (9pm). Morehouse College, Atlanta, teaches its black
students to be proud, confident and ruthless. When these qualities are
allied to extremism - any sort of religious fundamentalism or political
militancy - it all starts to look alarming. The irony is that the place
turns out the rigidly conservative mindset one associates with the wearers
of white sheets rather than black skin - yet it produced Martin Luther King
and the film director Spike Lee. A disturbing film.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Arts: Choral traditions - Martin Hoyle welcomes the Danes
and bemoans the financial state of some superb British choirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consider this paradox. In some repertoire British choirs are second to none.
Yet some of our most acclaimed choral groups are scarcely heard in Britain.
They simply cannot afford to sing here.
The Monteverdi Choir, for example, limits itself to three or four London
appearances a year. The Sixteen gives 75 to 80 per cent of its concerts
outside the UK. Both are capable of superlative work by international
standards, denied to the British public. John Bickley of Magenta Music
describes the situation as scandalous.
The run-up to Christmas provides an ironic contrast in national attitudes to
funding. As part of the Great Choirs of Europe series, the Danish Radio
Choir brings London a fascinating programme of modern Scandinavian music. In
its present form dating from 1937, the choir is subsidised by Danmarks Radio
to the tune of DKr9m (Pounds 100,000), increased by Pounds 250,000 when
enlarged for symphonic-scale works. Despite economic turbulence and
threatened cuts that sound all too familiar to British music-lovers, the
choir should be safe for the next ten to eleven years.
Besides Copenhagen's imminent metamorphosis into Europe's City of Culture,
the choir already has projects for the year 2005 - unthinkable in British
musical planning. The Danish choir's position seems the reverse of, say, the
highly praised Sixteen. Like most British choirs, the BBC excepted, The
Sixteen has no regular funding. It has to raise money project by project,
from foreign promoters or foundations. John Bickley looks enviously at the
Danish and Dutch choirs that have been working with The Sixteen in the Great
Choirs of Europe series, both state-funded, both providing permanent
employment.
The Sixteen performs its now established Messiah the day after the Danes
display their Nordic treasures. The irony is that the appetite for choral
music is thriving. The choral repertoire extends from the currently popular
meditative medievalism to the exciting sounds of the Estonian Veljo Tormis
in the Danes' programme ('We're very liberal in our view of Scandinavia,'
says Ivar Munk, the Danes' manager), or Sven-David Sandstrom's thrilling
setting of Blake's Tyger.
But then, as John Bickley observes, 'an orchestra covers 150 years of music,
a choir like The Sixteen covers a thousand. With a wider repertory and lower
overheads, a small amount of money can go much further.'
The Danish Radio Choir sings at St John's Smith Square on tonight; The
Sixteen gives The Messiah there tomorrow.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Arts: Babes in the Wood/Peter Pan - Pantomime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pantomime has returned to Sadler's Wells with a vengeance. Roy Hudd's Babes
In The Wood - written by Roy Hudd, directed by Roy Hudd, starring Roy Hudd -
is pure, unreconstructed family pantomime in all its tacky glory.
Unperturbed by the recent new wave of children-orientated Christmas shows -
which have done away with dames, principle boys, blue jokes and TV stars in
favour of proper storylines and fuller characters - this show is as flimsy
and ridiculous as the glittery costumes and scenery. Yet it manages to avoid
the true excesses of the totally commercial show (there are no sports
personalities or weather girls in sight) and it demonstrates how the full
blown panto is next of kin to the variety show, demanding performers who can
do the business: tap dancing, add libbing, the lot.
The story is the traditional Babes In The Wood/Robin Hood conflation.
The plot is scarcely important here: this is old fashioned panto where plot
is just an excuse for a series of gags, routines and set pieces - effect is
everything. And most ingredients you could wish for are in here - a messy
kitchen scene, plenty of slapstick, a few double entendres, a totally
unfounded dance scene (what were all those czardas dancers doing in Sherwood
Forest anyway?) and more corpsing than the average morgue . . .
Keith Barron, as the Sheriff of Nottingham, makes a commanding and
thoroughly enjoyable baddy (so he plans to double taxes, eh? Oh outrageous.
It will be VAT on fuel next); Julie Mullins is suitably sickly as Maid
Marion and Lisa Hull is glamorously preposterous as Robin Hood. Jack Tripp,
amusing as Nurse Ribena, is advertised on the programme as 'Britain's
Greatest Dame'. I beg to differ - once you have seen Stanley Baxter do the
striptease, no one else comes near.
But the stars of the show are, of course, the dopey duo of henchmen hired to
kill the babes in the wood, Geoffrey Hughes and Roy Hudd. Hudd, in a series
of virulent smocks and stockings, his face beaming with that gap toothed
smile like a crazy turnip lantern, is a force to be reckoned with. He holds
the stage whenever he is on it, and his comic timing and easy, genial
relationship with the audience makes him irresistible and galvanises the
show.
The script proceeds on the understanding that the old ones are the best,
which is true half of the time, but there is an occasional whiff of
mothballs, and political jokes are pretty limp, while some of the corpsing
is perhaps more fun for those on the stage than those off it. The show
outstays its welcome, particularly for the children; it is broadly
enjoyable, rather than downright hilarious.
Piers Chater-Robinson's version of JM Barrie's classic at the Cambridge
Theatre, WC2 is sub-titled Peter Pan 'The British Musical'. Perhaps we could
retitle it 'A British Musical' in the hope that someone else will fly in to
repair the damage; it would be depressing to think that this saccharine,
superficial piece was the last word in musical adaptations.
Now revived by Chater-Robinson with two new songs at the Cambridge Theatre,
this version (the programme tells us) was first published in 1985, is now in
its second edition and has enjoyed many revivals - so it is clearly as
buoyant, popular and indestructible as Peter himself. Though quite why is
beyond me; right from the pounding overture, with the lights whirling in a
demented fashion around the auditorium, it goes all out for a young audience
offering them large chunks of cuteness, cod rock and roll, and feeble
characterisation.
All right, there are some redeeming features. It tells the story clearly (a
plus for the young children) and it looks pretty, with a charming Darling
household and a backdrop of twinkly stars. It picks up in the scenes with
the pirates, when the songs are quite funny and Ron Moody, as Captain Hook,
adds a touch of spice. With his lugubrious features and bedraggled wig,
looking like Charles II after a bad night on the tiles, he plays the
audience well, ad libs admirably and steps out of character just enough to
lift the show. At one point, he creeps right to the front of the stage, to a
sea of hissing and booing, and remarks, deadpan, 'How still is the night'.
But every time the show gets going, back comes the music to drown it all in
a ghastly, gooey sauce. It goes for cuteness at every turn. Nicola Stapleton
is perky as Peter, but under-used - there is no real sense of Pan's
cheekiness, subversiveness or charisma in the character as he is drawn here.
Debbie Wall gives a gutsy performance as Wendy but is foiled by winsome
lyrics and feeble dialogue. Worst of all, as Tinkerbell's light flickers
after drinking poison and Peter turns to the audience, who are all poised on
the edge of their seats with the words 'We believe in fairies' ready on
their lips, some sickening, piped chorus of children starts warbling 'You've
Gotta Believe' over the loudspeakers. If I were Tinkerbell, it would have
finished me off. It certainly confounded the audience.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Technology: On the road to electronic pricing - Kieran Cooke
looks at Singapore's ambitious efforts to curb its growing numbers of
motorists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Driving in many Asian cities is a nightmare. Car and motorbike sales in
Bangkok are rising by 13 per cent a year compared with a 1 per cent annual
increase in available road space. At times in the rainy season it can take
office workers in the Thai capital six hours to get home. Schoolchildren
regularly have to rise at 5am to be at school for an 8am start.
The situation in many other capital cities in the region is not much better.
The government in Singapore is the only administration in the region with a
comprehensive traffic control and mass transit system. But even highly
regulated Singapore has problems.
Despite a tax and quota system which has made cars in Singapore among the
world's most expensive - a car that would cost Dollars 11,000 (Pounds 6,700)
in Britain costs nearly six times as much in the island republic -
increasing affluence has encouraged more Singaporeans to be mobile.
Now Singapore is in the process of implementing an ambitious electronic road
pricing system (Erp). The aim is to make more efficient use of the island's
limited road network (Singapore is only 42km long and 23km wide) and
streamline existing labour-intensive systems. The charges levied under the
Erp will also hopefully deter motorists from excessive use of their cars.
Under the Erp system all vehicles using Singapore's roads will have an
in-vehicle unit (IU) permanently fitted to the windscreen or handlebars.
Each time the motorist uses the vehicle, a smartcard is inserted into the
IU. The smartcard, also referred to as an electronic purse, is issued by
local banks and can be used for other purposes, such as retail purchases. A
display on the IU tells the motorist how much there is on the card.
On various roads in Singapore motorists will pass through two overhead
gantries, set 15m apart. Antenna on the first gantry will use microwave
transmission to read the IU. As the vehicle passes, the IU will deduct the
amount from the smartcard, then inform antenna on the second gantry that a
deduction has been made.
At the same time a photograph will be taken of the rear licence plate of the
vehicle. If nothing is wrong, the photograph will be immediately
overwritten. If the motorist has no IU, no smart card or insufficient
funding on the card, the photograph and other details will be transmitted to
a central control centre. Enforcement measures will then be taken.
Norway already has a form of Erp in Oslo. The system is also being tried out
in the US.
'What will make our system different is that the Erp will be used on
multi-lane roads,' says Lew Yii Der of Singapore's national development
authority, the organisation which has been responsible for satisfying the
Erp's highly complex technical requirements.
'Existing systems funnel vehicles into a single track,' says Lew.
'Inevitably congestion results. But in our system vehicles will carry on as
normal on a three-lane highway and will not have to slow down. The aim is to
replace our manual system with an electronic one - and not create any
further congestion.'
At the moment Singapore operates a restricted zone round its central
business district, marked by gantries at 33 entrance points. Motorists who
enter the area have to buy tickets costing SDollars 3 (Pounds 1.30) per day
for a private car. Police stationed at each entry point check that vehicles
have their tickets displayed. Those who abuse the system face minimum fines
of SDollars 70.
The Erp will not only save on police labour. 'An important feature of the
Erp is that it is flexible,' says Lew. 'Charge rates can be varied according
to the prevaling congestion levels. Entry and exit information can also be
stored so as to more accurately gauge charges for things like car parking or
expressway toll ways.'
Initially the Erp will duplicate the existing manual system. However, it is
likely the system will later be extended to cover a greater part of
Singapore's road network.
Singapore's planners scoured the world for companies with technology to
implement the many complex features of the Erp system. Three consortia,
which include local companies and Japanese, Italian, British and Dutch
groups, have been shortlisted. Singapore gave each consortia SDollars 1m to
test their respective systems. A final decision on who will build the Erp
will be made by the middle of next year. The full system is due to be
operational by early 1998.
The Singapore authorities admit that the Erp depends to a large extent on a
law-abiding motoring public. If there was widespread abuse of the system,
checking vehicles and fining thousands of errant motorists could turn into a
full-time job for the police.
The Erp might be workable in a highly regulated, confined island state such
as Singapore. Hong Kong is also examining the system. But in countries with
a more widespread road network implementation of the system could be
problematical. Some worries have also been expressed that the system will
encourage the 'Big Brother' syndrome, with the authorities able to track the
movements of vehicles.
Lew says that the perceived disadvantages of the system are outweighed by
its positive points. 'Implementing the system is a considerable challenge.
But we are committed. We are the guinea pigs. The rest of the world will be
watching to see if we can make it work.'

FT  22 DEC 94 / Technology: Europe's liquid assets - Philips is leading an
assault on Japanese dominance of the active LCD market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A European joint venture is trying to squeeze in to the market for active
liquid crystal display units, a market dominated by Japanese manufacturers.
The Flat Panel Display company, led by Philips of the Netherlands, believes
its success could lie in a technology different from the one used by
Japanese manufacturers making active LCDs. These can accommodate fast-moving
pictures, unlike passive units used mainly for watches and calculators.
Three European manufacturers set up the joint venture last year, with
Philips taking an 80 per cent stake and its French partners, Thomson and
Sagem, holding 10 per cent each. Philips later reduced its holding to 70 per
cent to make room for Merck, the German supplier of liquid crystals, which
now also owns 10 per cent of the company.
The European industry believes that by seizing on an alternative technology
it has an advantage that may outweigh the handicap of starting so far behind
the Japanese. In the 1970s, European electronics companies dismissed LCDs as
a fad that would not last beyond the heyday of the digital watch.
Active LCDs are used in computer monitors as well as navigation systems in
cars and film screens that pop up from armrests in in-flight entertainment.
So far, the FPD's robot-equipped factory in Eindhoven is the only production
facility outside Japan that has launched mass commercial output of active
LCDs. The European manufacturers are keen to challenge not only Japanese
dominance, but also to beat US companies to a share of an industry growing
at an annual rate of 30 per cent.
'These are the same rates of growth seen in the early days of the integrated
circuit,' says Chris Stuve, FPD's chief executive, underlining the strategic
importance for Europe of gaining a foothold.
Having begun commercial production earlier this year at a rate of 40,000
screens per day, the company is currently boosting output to 75,000 per day.
By the turn of the century, the company aims to have captured 8 per cent of
the fast-expanding world market for active LCDs.
It has only a tiny market share now, with Japanese producers accounting for
more than 90 per cent of sales. Between now and 1998, the total market is
expected to surge nearly three-fold to Fl 14bn (Dollars 7.9bn) a year from
Fl 5bn in 1994.
Entering the market is not cheap. FPD's partners have spent a combined Fl
500m on capital investment alone in the Eindhoven plant.
Besides the European initiative, the Japanese are facing plans for
commercial production from South Korean manufacturers, while the Clinton
administration has targeted active LCDs as a strategic growth area for US
companies.
To lay claim to a portion of the market the Europeans will have to prove
that their screens - and their technology - are at least as good as those
produced in Japan.
The difference in the European and Japanese approach to LCDs lies in the way
electrical current is moved around the screens.
Japanese manufacturers use thin-film transistors in their screens, a logical
consequence of the development route they have taken since LCDs first
emerged 20 years ago.
Philips and its European partners have opted for what they say is a simpler
thin-film diode as the main switching device in their LCDs. Unlike
transistors, which require three electrical connections, the diode uses two.
The Europeans say these smaller switches make their screens brighter because
they block out less light. More important, the company says the simpler
switching system means the screens can be made in fewer manufacturing steps,
enabling Europe to produce at a lower cost than Japanese market leaders,
such as Sharp and NEC.
Indeed, the European joint venture says its screens can be made in just
three or four 'maskings' compared with seven or eight for the Japanese
technology. Maskings are the cycle of substrate-depositing,
photo-lithography and etching needed to convert the glass screen into an
active LCD.
The Philips-led venture is not the first to explore using diodes rather than
transistors. But it is the only one so far to have harnessed the technology
commercially. This is because it has overcome one of the problems associated
with diodes: they tend to produce screens with variations of light across
the display. By adding an extra pulse of voltage in a new, patented process,
Philips says, it has produced a uniform display.
Philips does not intend to license other producers to use the technology.
Instead, the technology will be used as a bargaining chip in the European
joint venture's quest to build a second factory. The new plant, expected to
cost around Fl 500m, is likely to be built somewhere in Asia, putting the
Europeans in their Japanese competitors' back yard.
Stuve says the company is looking for joint-venture partners for the new
factory, with the transfer of technology as one of the attractions of
striking a deal. The decision on whether to go ahead with an Asian factory
is expected in the next 18 months. Asia is attractive because that is where
greatest number of active LCDs are sold.
While Philips and its partners intend to challenge this Asian pre-eminence,
they have already stopped trying to rival Japanese dominance in the field
for very small LCDs used in camcorders at the consumer end of the market.
They have also had to accept another fact of life that again highlights
Japanese dominance in the market: the specialised, high-quality glass they
use in their screens must still be imported from Japan because it is not yet
made by any of Europe's glass manufacturers.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Green shopper guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have high unemployment and the recession turned green consumers monochrome
as black and white pricing issues have replaced environmental concerns on
their shopping list?
Suggestions that environmental awareness has declined have prompted some UK
retailers to withdraw green products, introduced during the environmental
boom of the early 1990s. Others have claimed that recession-hit shoppers'
preoccupation with saving money has dented their willingness to pay a bit
extra for 'greener' products.
However, a new study* by Mintel, the UK market research group, shows that
environmental issues remain high on consumers' agendas in spite of the
recession and unemployment. In poll data released last week, the number of
those who said they are either unaware of or unconcerned about green issues
was 8 percentage points below the figure in the previous survey in 1990.
The evidence also points to a continuing, if muted, rise in willingness to
buy environmentally-friendly goods among shoppers already sensitive to green
issues. Meanwhile, the number of 'armchair' greens - who say they care about
environmental issues but have not changed their spending habits - grew by 5
percentage points.
Rather than being concentrated among relatively young, wealthy and educated
shoppers, environmentally- conscious consumption is now much more evenly
spread in terms of income and age nationwide.
Moreover, the indications are that consumers will increasingly expect more
information about a product's history and a company's business background
before parting with their
cash.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Fresh milk runs out
of bottle - As prices rise, dairies are adopting new strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It will come as a surprise to most British milk-drinkers that, in a recent
Gallup survey, 96 per cent of the people sampled could not taste the
difference between longlife and fresh milk. Most British consumers insist
the taste of UHT (ultra heat treated) milk puts them off. Unlike their
French and Spanish counterparts, UK shoppers have resisted the pull of
convenience over what they perceive as the superior taste of fresh milk.
But Tetra Pak, the international packaging and milk processing company that
commissioned the survey, plans a wide marketing campaign to try to remove
some of the shoppers' prejudice.
'Longlife has never been actively marketed, positioned or explained in the
UK market and it will be difficult to persuade consumers that it is
acceptable and palatable,' says Steve Milne, marketing manager at Tetra Pak.
But the company believes the time is right to try to build a market almost
from scratch - UHT represents around 5 per cent of the 5.8bn-litre UK milk
market.
The Pounds 3.3bn milk market in England and Wales is currently in a state of
flux following the liberalisation of supply in November which introduced
competitive forces for the first time in 60 years. The uncertainties in the
market and the continuing decline of doorstep sales could provide an opening
for longlife, Milne believes.
At the same time, improvements in processing techniques have made UHT more
palatable. 'The public's perception of UHT is lagging the reality and we're
coming up with an information and communication campaign to try and explain
that,' says Milne.
The company is considering widespread TV and media advertising in the new
year, but it is also testing the results of a range of different marketing
techniques. In the run-up to Christmas, it plans to stress the convenience
of having a cupboard-full of longlife milk instead of jamming the fridge
full of bottles of fresh.
The company plans to drop leaflets at half the homes in the UK in coming
weeks, it is paying for promotional features in leading food magazines and
sponsoring the Christmas edition of the TV Times where a cookery article
will stress the benefits of longlife. At the same time, it is hoping that
UHT taste testings at supermarkets across the country will help change
attitudes.
Milne says that, while improvements in processing techniques have made
longlife taste better, the real break for UHT could come from consumer
preferences for lower fat products. It is the cream that is affected by the
heat treatment process causing a slight caramel taste. But semi-skimmed and
skimmed UHT milk differ little in taste from fresh, pasteurised milk since
they also contain less cream.
When asked to rank the milk they liked best in blind tasting, a majority of
the 535 people sampled in the Gallup survey chose semi-skimmed UHT ahead of
semi-skimmed pasteurised and skimmed fresh milks. In addition, seven in 10
of the respondents found the taste of the UHT milks acceptable.
Milne stresses that longlife milk can solve a variety of problems for the
dairy industry which is still coming to terms with the new competitive
market. For one, processing of UHT milk can be an outlet for supply
surpluses that are created at certain times of the year when cows are having
calves. Dairies are rapidly closing excess capacity for producing butter and
skimmed milk powder, traditionally used to cope with excess supply.
Longlife milk could also help to boost overall milk consumption in spite of
the decline in doorstep sales. 'Our survey found that 48 per cent of the
households headed by people in the 16-44 age range had run out of milk at
some point in the past six weeks,' he said. 'When that happens people start
to develop a taste for black coffee and use less milk.' He wants to position
longlife as a top-up product to ensure that shoppers never run out - UHT has
a shelf life of six months.
A growth in longlife use will reduce the need for supermarkets to provide
costly refrigeration equipment as more consumers turn to them for milk. The
ease of distribution of longlife milk has been a factor in its growth on the
continent where French consumption has risen to around 60 per cent of the
market in the past 20 years.
Longlife has proved so successful in Mediterranean countries because it
keeps better in the hot climate. UHT has expanded in Spain from an almost
negligible share of the market to a share of around 80 per cent of sales in
the past 10 years.
Tetra Pak does not expect longlife to take over in the UK, which is the only
market in Europe where fresh milk dominates. But the company hopes sales may
double in the next three years so that eventually it will resemble the
German market where consumption is split evenly.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cheese market - As
prices rise, dairies are adopting new strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When brothers Ian and David Skailes tuck into their Christmas lunch, the
Stilton on their cheeseboard is likely to absorb more of their attention
than usual.
As specialist cheese-makers supplying London retailers Fortnum &amp; Mason,
Selfridges and Harrods, their priority is to produce the best cheese money
can buy.
But this year's deregulation of the milk market  - accompanied by a surge in
the cost of milk  - has spurred them to find new ways of adding value to
their cheeses.
'There's a strong market for jars of Stilton and presentation packs,' says
Ian Skailes, production director of Cropwell Bishop Creamery, the family
company based outside Nottingham.
'We do a lot of sales at airport shops. We're looking at new packaging and
presentation and making sure quality is always at the top end of the
market,' he says.
Since deregulation on November 1, cheesemakers have had to pay up to 20 per
cent more for their milk from Milk Marque, the dairy producers' co-operative
that replaced the statutory Milk Marketing Board and controls more than 65
per cent of supplies.
Both specialist and mass producers are moving further upmarket in an attempt
to maintain margins and market share.
Last month the Nottinghamshire creamery cut output of its lower value
Cheddar and Leicester by 40 per cent.
It is now making about 800 tonnes of Stilton and 500 tonnes of Cheddar and
Leicester a year, a dramatic change from three years ago when the respective
balance was 600 tonnes of Stilton to 1,500 tonnes of 'hard-pressed' cheese.
'There's no money to be made out of Cheddar,' says Skailes.
Milk represents 75-90 per cent of the cost of making Cheddar, but nearer 60
per cent of the cost of producing Stilton, which is more labour-intensive.
Cropwell Bishop hopes to pass on its increased costs to its customers in
January in the form of a 10 per cent rise in prices.
Singleton's Dairy in Lancashire also foresaw an increase in milk prices as
deregulation loomed. It decided to move away from its 60 per cent dependence
on block Cheddar into higher-value cheeses. Last year, it launched
Truckledown, a new cheese made from 'a mixture of a few of our old family
recipes', says Bill Riding, director.
This year it introduced Grandma Singleton's Strong Lancashire, matured for a
record nine-10 months. 'We got a feeling the cheese market was looking
towards more mature cheeses,' Riding explains. 'Cheese consumers are also
becoming more cosmopolitan and trying more varieties.'
The dairy is now building up its supplies of traditional farmhouse cheeses
to supermarket delicatessen counters. Like Cropwell Bishop, it is also
enjoying a growth in demand for its cheeses from the continent.
At the mass end of the Pounds 1.2bn cheese market, adding value is just as
important, although the spur is the threat of imports rather than the
promise of exports. The industry believes higher prices will draw in more
imported cheese, which already accounts for 30 per cent of the market and is
dominated by mild Cheddar, notably from Ireland.
The Cheese Company, Britain's biggest independent manufacturer, is busy
trying to differentiate its product from such imports to hold on to its 24
per cent market share.
It has adopted a marketing tactic known as 'sub-branding'  - where the name
of the creamery is carried on the label alongside that of the retailer. 'Our
research has shown that way above the price and appearance of the cheese
people like to know its origins,' says Sharon Rudd, product manager.
The company has just launched a range of mostly mature cheeses from three of
its five creameries  - Taw Valley in Devon, Reece's in Cheshire and Castle
Loch near Lockerbie in Scotland  - in partnership with Marks and Spencer and
Somerfield. The M&amp;S labels provide a brief description of the cheese.
Reece's Wensleydale is described as 'a young cheese with a clean, tangy
flavour and a crumbly texture'.
This is one way for manufacturers to make inroads into a market that is 85
per cent dominated by retailers' own-label cheese. But does it amount to
more than adding a few well-chosen words to a label?
Roger Davenport, the Cheese Company's managing director, believes it does.
'We're making a contract with the consumer that cheese comes from where it
says, and that the product is consistently delivering the expectations all
the way through the year.'
Although it has started with its most characterful, premium quality cheeses,
the company hopes to pursue sub-branding throughout its range. It says other
retailers are interested in the idea and aims to be in partnership with
another leading multiple next year.

<TEXT>
The run-up to Christmas is always a nervous time in the City because that's
when many firms make their cuts. This year one of the victims is Laing &amp;
Cruikshank which made an indelible mark on the mining market. Back in 1987
'Lang &amp; Bang' was taken over by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned French
bank, but retained its separate identity and international mining team. Now
five out of the seven team members - including Mike Kurtanjek, the
department head - have been made redundant and the activities absorbed into
other areas within CL.
Tim Hoare, who helped build up Laing &amp; Cruikshank but who left CL 18 months
ago to set up his own, eponymous, broking business, still concentrating on
mining, said: 'This is very sad, the end of an era. Laing &amp; Cruikshank was
part of the mining world for 25 years and had a good franchise. I was proud
to be part of that and I'm very sorry for the guys that are being made
redundant.'

<TEXT>
Ladbroke, the gaming, hotels, retail and property group, has appointed Brian
Wallace as group finance director. He is currently group finance director of
Geest, the fresh produce and prepared foods company, and will take up his
new post by April 1.
The appointment ends months of uncertainty over the replacement for Jerry
O'Mahony, who died in June. Until Wallace arrives, the position will
continue to be occupied by David Wilson, who was seconded from Ernst &amp; Young
in February to cover for O'Mahony and appointed acting finance director in
August. Wilson is then expected to be appointed to another senior mangement
position.
Wallace, 40, a St Andrews economics graduate, was appointed to his current
position in 1990. He had previously worked for Schlumberger, and as group
financial controller at APV, the producer of food processing equipment,
after qualifying as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse.
This appointment adds to the list of changes at Ladbroke after Cyril Stein
retired as chairman last January. The group has since moved back into
casinos after a 15-year absence.

FT  22 DEC 94 / People: P&amp;O - Harris climbs another rung
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tim Harris, 47, has been marked out as the coming man at Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Britain's biggest transportation
conglomerate. Harris, who has responsibility for businesses producing more
than a third of the group's profits, has been promoted to assistant managing
director.
Harris, in common with several of P&amp;O's top executives, comes from Sterling
Guarantee Trust, the property and services company founded by Lord Sterling,
P&amp;O's chairman. P&amp;O merged with SGT in 1985 after Lord Sterling, who had
taken over the chairmanship of P&amp;O in 1983, saved the 155-year-old shipping
company from an unwelcome takeover bid by Trafalgar House. Sir Bruce
MacPhail, SGT's managing director and Lord Sterling's most trusted
lieutenant, took over as P&amp;O's managing director in 1985.
P&amp;O played down speculation yesterday that Harris was being lined up to take
over from MacPhail. Lord Sterling, who turns 60 later this month, and
MacPhail, 55, show no intention of retiring and P&amp;O does not have a
mandatory retirement age for executive directors. Sir Frank Lampl, chairman
of P&amp;O's Bovis construction business, for example, is 68. However, given
Harris' relative youth his promotion suggests that he would be the
front-runner to take over if MacPhail were to step down.
Harris has been responsible for transforming the fortunes of P&amp;O's cruise
ship operation. He was sent to Los Angeles in 1986 to take control of that
business and oversaw the 1988 takeover of Sitmar Cruises. He has trebled the
size of P&amp;O's Princess Cruises and P&amp;O now earns over a fifth of its profits
from cruising.
In addition to overseeing P&amp;O's fast-growing cruise ship operation - another
three vessels are on order including the world's biggest cruise ship -
Harris is also in charge of P&amp;O Containers, P&amp;O European Transport Services
and P&amp;O Bulk Shipping. He retains responsibility for these areas.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Accountancy: Big Six incorporation race still in with a
chance as a 1995 classic - Jim Kelly interviews KPMG's senior partner who
explains the firm'sstrategy in its planned move away from a partnership
structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ian Brindle, the acerbic senior partner at Price Waterhouse, once famously
said on the subject of accountancy firms moving from partnership to
incorporation that it was a matter of: 'when not whether'.
After that things became much more simple. The issue boiled down to a
question of 'Who?'.
In October this year, KPMG Peat Marwick announced the start of a
consultation period with clients, regulators, and institutional investors on
a plan to incorporate its core audit business. A final decision is now
likely in late February or early March 1995.
It is still not certain that KPMG will cross the line first. The rest of the
Big Six are all either blowing the dust off long-drawn incorporation plans,
circulating papers for discussion with partners, or keeping quiet. Touche
Ross seems to be the least enthusiastic.
There is still a chance that a rush to incorporation will deliver most of
the big firms into incorporation in 1995. But the likelihood is that KPMG's
public lead will be maintained to the finishing line.
The problem for KPMG's competitors is divining just why the firm wants to
move so quickly. Has it spotted some commercial advantage the others have
missed? In particular, how is it going to deal with the many difficulties
identified with incorporation over the years?
All those involved see the central advantage to incorporation - the
replacement of joint and several liability by corporate and individual
liability. The growing burden of litigation, and threatened litigation, is
seen by the Big Six as a burden serious enough to push one of them out of
business.
Incorporation cannot remove that threat to the business, which can still be
pursued to destruction in the courts. But the lesser prize of ring-fencing
the personal assets of partners from the consequences of negligence by their
colleagues is plain enough.
What appears to be at the core of KPMG's motivation is a desire to promote
auditing as the core of its business and to give it room to develop within
the new company.
Freed from the anxieties created by joint and several liability, it
obviously sees a more dynamic future outside the partnership.
But it is the details which have often stopped other firms from moving
ahead. I asked Colin Sharman, the senior partner at KPMG who has driven it
forward on incorporation, some of the questions the rest of the accountancy
profession is currently asking about incorporation.
Would 'KPMG Audit' have to apply for all the audits currently held by KPMG
Peat Marwick?
'There would be a definite change which the shareholders (of the client
companies) would have to vote on,' he says, adding that the consultation
period with clients and investors has been crucial in order to pave the way
for such a handover.
What will be the investment and fund-raising policies of the audit arm? What
will be its capital base?
'We will have in the audit arm the capital we need to run the business,' he
says. On the capital base, he says KPMG is taking soundings in the market
and advice from a third party. 'The phrase that is used is that it needs to
be substantial. It's not going to be Pounds 100. We are right in the middle
of those discussions now.'
How will you protect partners not in the audit arm from litigation if they
become involved in a troubled audit?
'You can never, and we will not seek, to protect an individual from the
results of his own negligence. That individual can always be pursued whether
we have partnership or a company.'
But could a litigant pursue a partner of KPMG Peat Marwick involved in an
audit with the company, and so gain access to assets of all the partners
through joint and several liability?
'We think not. We have looked into that and the advice we have got is no.
The audit service would be rendered by the auditor and the audit company.
Assuming that action was brought under the law of contract the action would
be against the incorporated body.'
Even in a corporation you can be sued if you are involved in negligence. But
how closely do you have to be involved?
'I think if you sign the audit report, you are pretty directly involved. I
think a concurring partner might well be involved. I think it could be quite
a wide net rather than a very narrow net. I don't think it would be
restricted to just the person who signed the audit report.'
How will you spread the tax and national insurance costs of incorporation?
'The partners will bear it individually.'
So it will be incurred by the auditors but spread across all the partners of
the firm?
'Absolutely.'
The audit partner would be a partner of the firm and a director of the audit
company?
'Absolutely. Because remember that our audit partners also do non-audit
work. When they are acting as an auditor, they will be acting as a director
of the company.'
Is incorporating the audit arm the only plan?
Mr Sharman said that it was 'still feasible' that KPMG would incorporate as
a whole.
What will be shown in the accounts of the firm and company accounts which
you have promised to publish if incorporation goes ahead?
You will be able to see the total take of partners, the average pay per
partner, and the key players' details.'
Can you rule out a flotation?
'We've absolutely no intention of doing that. I can honestly put my hand on
my heart and say we have never considered it. There are some things you talk
about and decide not to do: we haven't even talked about it.'
How is the consultation going?
Mr Sharman said that there were two main groups. Those who accepted the need
to limit liability and welcomed incorporation; and those who understood the
problem and would accept incorporation subject to assurances, such as a
continuation of the present insurance arrangements, and that the audit arm
would be a 'company of substance'.
'And a third group which is very small. There are some people who say they
do not like it. Those are people who say professional services should be
provided through partnerships so we can get at all your assets. The way I
interpret that is there is a difference of opinion between those people and
us about what we are doing. We are providing a professional service; I think
they are looking for insurance. We are not in the insurance business.'
How will you preserve the partnership ethos?
'If you can preserve the partnership ethos in a partnership of 600, you can
preserve it in an incorporation. The question that should have been asked is
can you preserve the ethos in a partnership that moves from 20 to 600
partners.'
Will the audit company be told what to do by the firm?
'I would regard it as being in the same position as a subsidiary of a
holding company.'

FT  22 DEC 94 / Coopers' Maxwell move fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coopers and Lybrand, the leading accountancy firm, has failed in its attempt
to stop an investigation into its auditing of the Maxwell Group pension
funds, Jim Kelly writes.
The Joint Disciplinary Scheme, the accountancy profession's regulator,
wanted to investigate its role as an auditor.
High Court judges Lord Justice Henry and Mr Justice Kay said: 'The question
should be addressed promptly, and its resolution should not await and be
dependent on the final resolution of civil proceedings, which may be some
years off.'
The case hinged on whether regulators can investigate cases still being
heard in criminal and civil courts. As such it is seen as a test case for
regulators in all sectors, including the financial markets.
Coopers and Lybrand argued that if it were to lose a case before the JDS the
result could be 'catastrophic' for the firm.
The accountancy firm Price Waterhouse had previously successfully argued
that a JDS investigation into its part in the BCCI affair should await the
conclusion of civil actions.
Coopers said: 'The decision has gone against us. We are taking legal advice
at the moment.' An appeal is seen as extremely likely.

FT  22 DEC 94 / US places bulk of new Lloyd's capital for 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US investors have provided the bulk of new capital committed to Lloyd's of
London for next year, partly filling the hole left by exiting Names -
individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market.
A total of Pounds 331m has been raised by companies for next year, in
addition to Pounds 900m invested this year. More than half of the new money
came from the US - in sharp contrast to when UK institutions provided most
of the new Lloyd's capital.
About 70 per cent of the investment for 1995 has come from the international
insurance industry or specialist insurance investment funds.
Many investors were put off by Lloyd's continuing difficulties - including
outstanding litigation and enormous potential liabilities, particularly from
US asbestosis and pollution claims. The poor share performance of listed
corporate vehicles launched last year also acted as a deterrent.
One US fund, which had pledged Pounds 50m, abandoned its plans at the last
moment, apparently worried that Lloyd's was not changing quickly enough from
a market that raised funds from individuals, on the basis of unlimited
liability, to corporate capital. Swiss Bank Corporation was left with a
substantial number of shares in Matheson Lloyd's Investment Trust, which it
had agreed to underwrite.
Where investors have committed funds for 1995, most have chosen 'dedicated'
companies which invest only in syndicates run by one managing agency, unlike
most of those who entered this year, which have spread funds across a wide
range.
Lloyd's four biggest investors in 1995 are:
Insurance Partners, a Dollars 540m (Pounds 346.1m) US equity investment fund
specialising in the insurance industry. Harvard Private Capital Group, which
manages Dollars 1.4bn of private investments and is a subsidiary of the
company running the Dollars 7bn endowment fund of Harvard University.
Trident, a Bermuda-based company investing in insurance and reinsurance. It
was formed a year ago by Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's biggest insurance
broker, JP Morgan, Mid Ocean, a Bermuda reinsurance company, and Byrne Sons,
a small investment bank. Liberty Mutual, the big US mutual insurance company
which has raised Pounds 40m to invest in a syndicate currently run by the
Cater Allen managing agency.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Base rate rise indicated at Clarke talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month's rise in UK bank base rates was foreshadowed in November's
discussions on monetary policy between Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, according to
minutes of their meeting released yesterday.
The minutes show Mr George saying there was a case, if evidence on prices
and activity was taken at face value, for a rise in interest rates at the
time of the meeting on November 2.
The governor said that on the basis of what was currently known, rates would
'probably need to rise before very long'.
He was, however, 'inclined to wait a little' to see whether clearer signs
appeared of an easing in the rate of UK growth and how wage and price
pressures devel-oped.
Mr Clarke said Britain was having a healthy and well-balanced recovery with
inflation remaining low. But further ahead the data were 'somewhat mixed'.
His inclination was not to change rates at the November meeting and in his
view the evidence at that time showed no need to act. 'Looking ahead, we
would need to remain cautious and alert to the potential risks,' he said.
In concluding there was agreement to leave rates unchanged, Mr Clarke noted
that there was uncertainty about the effect that the tax rises already
announced before last month's Budget might have on consumer demand.
He said it was important to check that statistics which had a good record as
indicators of inflation in the past were still reliable.
Although the minutes reveal the now familiar nuances indicating the
difference in approach to rates between governor and chancellor, they bear
out both men's claims that the December 7 base rate increase to 6.25 per
cent from 5.75 per cent was based on economic and not political factors.

FT  22 DEC 94 / November trade at record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent improvement in the UK's visible trade performance continued in
November, with Britain recording its lowest underlying deficit with
non-European Union countries since January 1988.
If oil and erratic items such as precious stones are excluded, the November
deficit with non-EU countries was Pounds 293m, down from Pounds 390m in
October. According to the Central Statistical Office, increased exports of
chemicals, material manufactures and some finished manufactures were
responsible for the improvement.
The overall deficit narrowed slightly to Pounds 361m, from Pounds 420m in
October. Both exports and imports reached record levels, boosted by
increased trade in precious stones.
The CSO said that the trend was for a flattening in the deficit. In the
first 11 months of the year the deficit was Pounds 5.4bn, compared with
Pounds 8.6bn in the same period last year.
There were further positive signs for manufactured goods. The UK had a
deficit of Pounds 146m in finished manufactures in November, up slightly
from Pounds 124m in October. The Pounds 571m deficit for the three months
ending in November was the lowest three-monthly total since July 1991.
Imports of semi-manufactures jumped between October and November. Mr
Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at HSBC markets, said: 'This points to further
strong growth in manufacturing output in the months ahead.'
Export volumes, excluding oil and erratics, rose 3.5 per cent between
October and November to reach a record, while imports increased 2 per cent.
In the three months to November export volumes were 8 per cent higher than a
year ago, while imports fell 2 per cent.
The CSO said, however, that its estimate of the trend in volume was of
continued growth in exports, with some signs of imports turning up.
Import prices have been falling in recent months, due to a drop in the
dollar and yen against sterling.
Balance of payments figures for the third quarter, which include trade in
invisible items such as services and tourism, will be published today.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Business rates blow for London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies in London will pay more than expected in business rates next year,
making them unwilling to accept higher rents and more likely to move to new
premises, property experts said yesterday.
While property values in central London have fallen by up to 60 per cent
since business rates were last set in 1988, transitional arrangements
outlined in last month's Budget limit cuts in rates bills to 5 per cent a
year for large buildings.
The average central London office occupier currently pays business rates of
about Pounds 16 a sq ft. Based on property values that liability should have
fallen to about Pounds 6.75 a sq ft.
Under the transitional arrangements, however, occupiers will still be paying
Pounds 15.55 a sq ft next year - a saving of only 45p.
Property agents said higher than expected rates would make it more difficult
for landlords to charge higher rents.
Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors, has reduced its rental growth forecasts
for top City properties in the next two years, although it expects the
transitional arrangements to be more generous to central London occupiers
thereafter.
Rates on new buildings - occupied for the first time after April 1995 - will
be set immediately at the lower level, reflecting the current value of the
premises.
This will make new offices up to Pounds 10 a sq ft cheaper to occupy than
older premises and could encourage developers to press ahead with new
buildings.
Yet agents said that business rates would not in themselves spark a
development boom.
Sir Brian Goswell, of Healy &amp; Baker, the surveyors, said: 'What really
matters to a developer is whether he can find a tenant for a new building.
Most tenants are locked into old leases and do not have the option of
moving.'

FT  22 DEC 94 / Obituary of Sir Henry Phelps Brown: Rare master of economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'It has long been claimed that an economist is not trained who is not
numerate; but neither is he trained if he is not historiate.' This argument,
made in Sir Henry Phelps Brown's presidential address to the Royal Economic
Society, published in the Economic Journal in 1972, defined his creed as an
economist.
In his outstanding work on labour economics Phelps Brown combined economics
with history, sociology and statistics. This eclecticism made him somewhat
unfashionable. He returned the compliment in complaining of modern
theoretical economics that 'its usefulness is not equal to its distinction'.
Born in Calne, Wiltshire, on February 10 1906, Phelps Brown was educated at
Taunton School and Wadham College, Oxford, where he was secretary of the
Oxford Union in 1928 and gained first class honours in modern history in
1927, and politics, philosophy and economics in 1929. He was a fellow of New
College from 1930 to 1947. In 1936 he published The Framework of the Pricing
System, which contained an orthodox exposition of marginal theory.
After distinguished war service, Phelps Brown became the first professor of
the economics of labour at the University of London, teaching at the London
School of Economics until 1968. A Course in Applied Economics was first
published in 1951 and issued in a second edition with Jack Wiseman in 1964.
Economics of Labour appeared in 1962.
Among the principal concerns and, indeed, tensions in Phelps Brown's work
was the relative role of market pressures and historical forces in pay
determination. In 1968 he published A Century of Pay, analysing pay and
production in France, Germany, Sweden, the UK and US. Among its conclusions
were that 'the number of jobs increased at the same rate, decade by decade .
. . as the number of applicants' and that 'wages, in terms of the product,
rose in the same proportion as productivity'. In similar vein, he published
The Inequality of Pay in 1977, which argued that market forces were more
important than 'custom, convention, status, or power'.
LSE statistical studies were republished, in 1981, in Phelps Brown and
Sheila V. Hopkin's, A Perspective on Wages and Prices. This included an
analysis of real wages in building, first published in 1955, which was based
on a wage series and a widely used and justly celebrated consumer price
index, going back seven centuries. The principal finding was one of
remarkable stability in real wages, with no sustained change in 500 out of
the 690 years. Similar stability was found in wage differentials between
craftsmen and labourers, this being ascribed to the 'inertia of convention'.
Alongside such predominantly statistical studies went analyses of the
history of British labour relations. One such was The Growth of British
Industrial Relations: a study from the standpoint of 1906-14, published in
1959. Another was The Origins of Trade Union Power, published in 1983.
In the latter, he argued: 'Much of the history of trade unionism can be
written out of (the) clash between the requirements that the economic system
imposes impersonally on labour as a factor of production, and the welfare of
workers as human beings, seeking a livelihood from the exercise of
particular skills, and attached to particular neighbourhoods.' Sympathetic
to incomes policy, he concluded that the threat to it 'arises when the trade
unions have not too much power but too little'. He suggested unions should
be made jointly responsible for decisions.
Phelps Brown thought that attitudes 'are among the basic determinants of
history'. His own determined his approach not just to his work, but to
economics as a subject. Economists, he suggested in 'The radical reflections
of an applied economist,' published in the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
Quarterly Review in 1980, should not merely 'study economics as that subject
now stands' but try 'to gain an understanding of the economic aspects of
human affairs so as to be able to contribute to their healthier
development'.
An element in that contribution was work on public bodies. Phelps Brown
served on the Council on Prices, Productivity and Income in 1959; on the
National Economic Development Council in 1962; on the OECD Working Party on
Wages and Labour Mobility from 1963 to 1964; and on the Royal Commission on
the Distribution of Income and Wealth from 1974 to 1978. His interest in the
commission led to a monumental last work, Egalitarianism and the Generation
of Inequality, published in 1988.
Phelps Brown was president of the Royal Economic Society from 1970 to 1972.
In his presidential address he said: 'In an experimental science,
assumptions chosen a priori can be tested against facts of observation; but
in economics there is little opportunity for experiment.' Furthermore,
'though fortunately some possibilities do exist of testing assumptions about
behaviour against statistical aggregates, running regressions against time
series is only likely to deceive'.
If assumptions cannot be tested, their plausibility can only be assessed
from observation and analysis. For this reason, he said, 'we ought to value
powers of observation more highly than powers of abstraction, and the
insight of the historian more than the rigour of the mathematicians'.
One reason this approach to economics has become rare is that, as he noted
in his 1980 article for the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro: 'The more abstract
the material, the more evident is the intellectual power of those who master
it. For this among other reasons the economic theorist moves among his
fellows with a certain majesty.' He also admitted that historical analysis
may explain, but cannot yield predictions. Among the most important reasons,
however, is that what Phelps Brown wanted economists to do is so difficult.
He, however, was a master of the art.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Stagecoach deal referred to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach, the private bus operator, has been referred to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission for its purchase of a 20 per cent stake in SB
Holdings, the former municipal bus operator in Stratchclyde which remains
dominant in the region.
The Department of Trade and Industry said it was acting on advice from the
Office of Fair Trading, which had urged an MMC inquiry because of concerns
about the impact of the acquisition on competition in Stratchclyde.
The MMC reference is the latest in a series of investigations by the OFT and
MMC into the competition implications of Stagecoach's ambitious expansion
activities.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Hurd brokers cabinet referendum deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior ministers believe the cabinet is moving towards a consensus on Mr
John Major's commitment to hold a referendum on further European integration
only if significant constitutional issues are at stake.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, is understood to have established broad
backing for the prime minister's formula - set out in a Financial Times
interview on Tuesday - after contacting the entire cabinet.
The emerging consensus reflects increasing confidence among ministers that
the European Union's 1996 intergovernmental conference is unlikely to
produce the drama of the last conference at Maastricht in 1991.
There is also agreement that there is no need for a firm commitment to hold
a referendum on the prospect of a single European currency because a
decision to go ahead is unlikely before 1999.
Mr Major's formula stops short of committing the government to a referendum
 -meeting the concerns of pro-European cabinet ministers, led by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
It also has the support of leading Eurosceptics such as Mr John Redwood,
Welsh secretary, who fear a firm commitment would reduce the pressure on Mr
Major to veto any unexpected proposals for constitutional change at the 1996
conference.
The Eurosceptics believe an undertaking to hold a referendum on a single
currency would be counter-productive because it would increase the chances
of a decision to go ahead.
The broad support for Mr Major's approach to the referendum issue makes it
unlikely that he will decide to offer a clearer commitment to a referendum
on either the intergovernmental conference issue or the single currency in
the new year, as has been widely suggested.
The prime minister may, however, restate his approach more clearly, probably
linking the role of referendums on European questions to the constitutional
implications of Labour's plans to reform the House of Lords and set up
Scottish and Welsh parliaments.
The cabinet's defence and overseas policy committee, chaired by Mr Major,
will start preparing a detailed case early next year calling on the 1996
meeting to limit itself to changes to improve the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Hurd is expected to take the lead in staking out an approach to the
conference negotiations on which the broad mass of the Conservative
parliamentary party can stand.
Mr Michael Howard, the moderately Eurosceptic home secretary, is seen as a
central figure in crafting an approach acceptable to all but the most
extreme Tory critics of the EU.
Senior ministers loyal to Mr Major are dismissive of the nine backbenchers
who lost or gave up the Conservative whip last month after a rebellion
against higher UK contributions to the union. There is concern, however,
about the mood of party workers.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Student loan body in 35,000 backlog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Student Loan Company, the quango which controls loans to students in
higher education, has a backlog of 35,000 students waiting for loans, it
said yesterday.
The company said about 9,000 of these had not received their loans because
of an administrative error. Forms had been sent to students in April - six
months before the loans would start - and far more had mislaid the forms
than the company had expected, with the result that administrators were
overloaded with inquiries at the start of term in September.
The remaining 26,000 students had either applied late or had failed to
complete their forms correctly.
Sir Eric Ash, acting part-time chief executive in the absence of Mr Ron
Harrison, who is ill, said students still waiting for loans should approach
their universities for hardship loans.
He said he was 'absolutely certain' the company would not repeat the
mistakes next year, which had led to 'too many' students facing delays.
Sir Eric said: 'The Student Loan Company is a very well-run company which
has run into a specific problem which no one anticipated.'
Vice-chancellors have campaigned to make loans repayable through income tax
or National Insurance. However, the government intends to cut grants by 10
per cent next year and the year after, and make up the balance in loans.
Mr Bryan Davies, Labour's higher education spokesman, said: 'If it had been
pensioners who had been waiting weeks for their pension, the nation would
have been in uproar.'

FT  22 DEC 94 / SIB sets guidelines for probe on pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Life companies which seem to have advised the most people to leave
employers' pensions schemes and take out personal plans will have to make
greater efforts to identify potential victims than other insurers, City
regulators said yesterday.
The Securities and Investments Board, the chief financial services watchdog,
said companies which could show that they had fewer victims in the
categories of investors most at risk would not have to go to such lengths to
persuade them to respond.
The differences in how far life insurers will have to go were revealed as
SIB published guidance about how the millions of personal pension holders
should be approached to identify those who should be compensated.
The guidance contains three warnings that the exercise must not be used to
try to sell new policies to investors.
The format of covering letters and the questionnaire to go to personal
pension holders have been prescribed by SIB after research intended to make
them understandable.
The questionnaire is an important step in identifying the estimated 850,000
people who were advised to take a personal pension and opt out of, or not
join, an occupational scheme. But the guidance leaves issues unclear,
including whether life companies which sell through independent financial
advisers should take on the administration of the questionnaires.
This was discussed at the Association of British Insurers last week but it
has proved impossible to find a consensus. Many companies will not want to
send out the questionnaires before a decision, even though delays will make
the deadlines for dealing with cases where there is the most risk of poor
advice harder to meet.
SIB has said that most of the 350,000 priority cases should be reviewed by
the end of 1996.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Labour looks at 'windfall' tax on lottery group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party may seek to impose a 'windfall' tax on Camelot, the
consortium which runs the National Lottery.
Some shadow cabinet members believe the terms in the National Lottery
licence under which Camelot will receive 5 per cent of the revenues for the
initial seven years are unjustifiably generous given the lottery's immediate
success.
They are therefore considering a tax on Camelot's share of lottery proceeds
if Labour wins the next general election. They see this as one way to
redress the balance without renegotiating the licence.
Although ticket sales have been strong since the lottery's launch last
month, a reliable picture of Camelot's finances is unlikely to be available
until early next summer, when it is expected to publish its first annual
report.
When Camelot won the licence to run the lottery in March it was believed
that its profit levels would be well under 1 per cent of sales and probably
about 0.6 per cent.
The consortium - whose members include Cadbury Schweppes, the food and
drinks group, ICL, the computer group, and De La Rue, the banknote printer
which this week bought Portals for Pounds 682m - says it will be 'several
years' before it breaks even. The 5 per cent of lottery revenues which
Camelot receives must cover all its costs.
In March the consortium forecast total sales of Pounds 32bn in the seven
years of the licence and payments of Pounds 9bn to good causes such as
charity and the arts. This implies revenue to Camelot of Pounds 1.6bn over
the period.
The consortium says Pounds 100m was invested before the lottery started,
with more to follow as the number of terminals is increased from 10,000 at
present to 40,000 by the end of 1996.
There are plans to introduce a series of scratch card games as part of the
lottery from next spring.

Imro said no losses had occurred to clients of the company as a result.
London Life had, among other breaches, wrongly informed the independent

FT  22 DEC 94 / BSkyB to step up war on pirates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, plans to
intensify its legal battle against commercial pirates after a significant
victory in the High Court.
The company this week obtained a permanent injunction against Mr David
Lyons, a supplier of pirate devices, who was described by Mr Justice Aldous
as 'a parasite'.
BSkyB said yesterday that Mr Lyons has to give up all pirate devices in his
possession. Both his building society and bank accounts are to be frozen.
Pirates have been using a range of devices to try to get round BSkyB's
scrambling system, which is designed to ensure that only those who pay
monthly subscriptions can watch most of the channels.
In the past devices have ranged from counterfeit cards which can 'unlock'
the signal to others designed to switch on 'dead' smart cards or upgrade
genuine cards so that they can be used to view all BSkyB channels.
Lawyers for Mr Lyons said that copyright law required BSkyB to show that his
devices possessed features which made them particularly suitable to enable
people to view BSkyB channels when they were not authorised to do so.
It was also argued that the requirement under the Copyright Designs and
Patents Act 1988 that broadcasters have to transmit to a satellite from the
UK amounted to discrimination under European law.
Mr Justice Aldous said the first argument was 'untenable and without merit'.
In reply to the second the judge said Mr Lyons was 'a parasite' who was not
personally suffering any discrimination.
BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake, said yesterday: 'Since the High Court has now confirmed
what BSkyB has always believed, BSkyB will continue to pursue all other
pirates and parasites who infringe its rights.'
Since the summer, when the company changed the cards of all its subscribers,
there has been no sign of working counterfeit cards on the market.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Unfinished QE2 refit hits US passengers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US passengers due to join the Queen Elizabeth 2's ill-fated Christmas cruise
in New York became the latest victims of the liner's unfinished Pounds 30m
refit programme as their holidays were cancelled yesterday.
The New York office of Cunard, the ship's owner, said yesterday that 1,000
passengers would leave New York tonight on the next leg of the QE2's cruise.
But it admitted it had been 'adjusting the inventory' - fewer cabins would
be available - and an undisclosed number of passengers who could not be
accommodated would be offered alternative cruises in compensation.
It refused to reveal the number of passengers who had been due to sail from
New York.
The US passengers join 158 disappointed UK holders of tickets who were due
to join the cruise in New York but had their holidays cancelled late on
Tuesday, as well as 500 left behind when the liner sailed from Southampton
last Saturday.
Cunard in London insisted there would be no further cancellations.
It said refitting work was continuing on the liner after bad weather had
caused delays, and insisted that enough accommodation would be ready.
Passengers on board reacted angrily to news that hundreds more would be
joining in New York. They have complained of conditions resembling a
'building site', overflowing toilets, 'stinking' swimming pools and closed
facilities.
They have formed an action committee which plans to take legal action
against Cunard.
Passengers not disembarking in the US but continuing to the Caribbean and
round-the-world cruise were told yesterday they would not have the planned
day's stop in New York.
The liner is expected to arrive in New York 16 hours behind schedule.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Five die in air freighter crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three aircrew and two cargo handlers were killed yesterday morning when
their Air Algerie Boeing 737-200 air freighter, on charter to Phoenix
Aviation, crashed on its approach to Coventry Airport.
The freighter hit an electricity pylon and clipped the roofs of two houses
before catching fire. It came to rest in woodland between the Willenhall
housing estate and the Coventry eastern by-pass.
There were no casualties on the ground. Chief Superintendent Peter Clay of
West Midlands Police said: 'It just missed a housing estate and we have to
be thankful for that.' Electricity supplies to large sections of Coventry
were cut off for several hours.
Phoenix Aviation chartered the aircraft to carry live cattle to France and
the Netherlands. The aircraft, having taken a load to Amsterdam, was
returning empty to Coventry after a diversion to East Midlands Airport
because of fog. Coventry was still misty at the time of the crash.
Department of Transport air accident investigators have started to search
for evidence which will establish why the aircraft prematurely lost
altitude. Police said the flight recorder had been found.
Willenhall residents said they had warned of the dangers of low flying
aircraft for 20 years.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Tec in receivership after 'Pounds 2m loss in eight months'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Employment yesterday called in administrative receivers at
South Thames Training and Enterprise Council because of its problems in
meeting financial liabilities.
This is the first time the department has taken such action on behalf of one
of the 82 employer-led bodies that administer government training schemes in
England and Wales.
Tecs receive about Pounds 2bn in public funds to administer such programmes
as Youth Training and Training for Work, a scheme for unemployed adults. In
the Budget the chancellor cut funding for Training for Work from Pounds 762m
to Pounds 578m.
South Thames Tec is a private company which covers the London boroughs of
Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham and Southwark, an area with the country's
highest levels of unemployment.
The Tec's board of directors asked the department to put it in
administrative receivership. It is understood that it has lost about Pounds
2m in the last eight months.
The decision to appoint a receiver followed three investigations into the
Tec's financial systems and accounts by the employment department and
independent accountants.
Mr James Paice, employment minister, said: 'The conclusion was that the Tec
is currently trading at a loss and forecasts that it will continue to do so,
(and) that its present and potential liabilities exceeded its current and
forecast assets.'
Last October the department warned the South Thames Tec that it was in
breach of contract for its weak financial monitoring systems.
Mr Paice said: 'The problems clearly go back to inadequate financial
management and control. Basically they have not lived within their means.'
In August the Tec's finance director resigned after its non-executive board
expressed concerns about accountancy practices. Mr Michael Hanson, the chief
executive, resigned for health reasons.
Under the terms of the receivership training services organised by the Tec
will not be suspended. Mr Paice said the department will underwrite all
training provider fees for three months.
Mr Scott Barnes, one of the Grant Thornton partners appointed as
administrative receivers, said he would consider transferring the Tec's
activities to another organisation.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Railtrack sell-off faces court test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Employment Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The RMT transport union is to seek leave from the High Court for a judicial
review of last month's government decision to privatise Railtrack, which
maintains the railway track and signal infrastructure.
The challenge follows the recent High Court success by 10 unions, including
the RMT, in overturning the home secretary's attempt to change the forms of
compensation to victims under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, and
by this week's climbdown by Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary, in
accepting a House of Lords judgment that part-time workers should have most
of the employment rights enjoyed by full-time workers.
The union says that powers to privatise Railtrack do not exist in the 1993
legislation that covers the move of the railway industry out of public
ownership, that the government 'deceived' parliament about the immediate
future of Railtrack during the passage of the act, and that the government's
proposals for Railtrack conflict with European Union directives.
Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, said yesterday: 'Following
intensive discussions with our legal advisers we have concluded the
government may be acting outside its powers in privatising Railtrack.
'There are vital constitutional issues here which must be addressed. The
government has a deplorable record of acting outside its powers and I am
confident that, given the chance to argue our case, the court will again
tell the government to think again.'
The union said in a statement it expected its case would be held early in
the new year.
It added that the detailed grounds for the challenge were still being
discussed with its solicitors but that the government was vulnerable.

FT  22 DEC 94 / QE2 passengers threaten a sit-in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Angry passengers on the Queen Elizabeth 2's ill-fated Christmas cruise are
threatening to stage a sit-in on the ship in New York tonight unless
directors of Cunard, the liner's owner, come aboard and offer them immediate
compensation.
Mr Peter Ludlow, travelling on the QE2 on a Pounds 7,500 cruise to the
Caribbean, said that about 150 passengers, due to disembark in New York,
were now planning to stay on the ship.
Mr Ludlow said by telephone from the ship last night: 'They are all prepared
not to come off until board members turn up to see us.'
Passengers have been angered by Cunard's refusal to discuss compensation
with them until they return home. Their luxury cruises have been disrupted
by the QE2's unfinished Pounds 30m refit.
Almost 500 passengers were unable to sail with the ship when it left
Southampton on Saturday because work was still going on in their cabins. A
further 158 UK passengers due to join the cruise in New York had their
holidays cancelled on Tuesday.
Passengers on board have complained of conditions resembling a 'building
site' - overflowing toilets, 'stinking' swimming pools and closed
facilities.
Mr Ludlow said a second group of about 80 passengers was planning to start
legal action in the US through an American lawyer who is herself a
passenger.
Mr Ludlow said: 'It is all getting quite factional here, among the
passengers. It is getting a bit like Bosnia.' Passengers on the
top-of-the-range round the world cruise have formed their own group, but are
unlikely to take any immediate action.
All three groups of passengers yesterday held their own meetings as well as
attending a meeting with Captain Ron Warwick.
Mr Ludlow, who is acting as a spokesman for disgruntled passengers, said he
was concerned about safety. He said that building materials strewn around
the ship were partly blocking some fire escapes.
Meanwhile, an undisclosed number of US passengers due to join the cruise in
New York had their holidays cancelled yesterday. The New York office of
Cunard said that 1,000 passengers would leave New York tonight on the next
leg of the QE2's cruise.
But it admitted that it had been 'adjusting the inventory' - fewer cabins
would be available - and passengers who could not be accommodated would be
offered alternative cruises in compensation.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Samsung seeks site for new plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Samsung, the Korean industrial group building a Pounds 450m electronics
complex in Cleveland, is 'seriously considering' setting up a UK plant to
assemble excavators and other heavy equipment.
The group, which earlier this week marked the establishment of its European
headquarters in Britain by switching on a big neon sign in London's
Piccadilly Circus, said it was considering a number of sites for the new
plant.
Mr Sung-Rai Choi, the recently appointed president of Samsung Europe, said
the group expected to make a decision on the new investment soon.
No financial details of the planned level of additional investment were
given, but Samsung said the new plant was expected to employ about 100
people initially.
Mr Jaehyung Lee, managing director of Samsung UK, said the proposed plant
would initially be used to assemble excavators, although production might be
extended to include fork lift trucks and other equipment.
Samsung is understood to be negotiating over a number of potential sites. An
inward investment specialist familiar with the negotiations said yesterday
that the company 'has looked at the whole of the north-east of England as
part of its site selection programme'.

FT  22 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Pact curbs shipbuilding subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's leading shipbuilding countries yesterday signed a pact to end
the subsidising of large vessels and adopt international trade rules by
January 1 1996.
After five years of negotiation, the industries agreed to eliminate both
direct and indirect subsidies, to create common rules for domestic and
export credit financing of ships, and to establish a strong enforcement
mechanism to discourage violations of rules.
The pact was signed in Paris by Japan, South Korea, Norway, the EU and the
US. It also extends to shipbuilding the protection of anti-dumping regimes,
which US shipbuilders said would raise ship prices to 'more realistic
levels'.
Mr Thomas Jones, chairman of the US shipbuilders council, yesterday
applauded the agreement. 'Foreign governments have been in a subsidy
competition to assist their shipyards to capture market share.' Without the
pact 'this situation would continue and even escalate, thereby perpetuating
the competitive disadvantage of unsubsidised US shipyards. He called on the
Clinton administration to 'actively oppose' the introduction of new
subsidies which would violate the agreement - specifically, subsidies for
French shipyards 'as reported in the press'.
The shipbuilding pact was provisionally agreed in July but opposed by the
French for months.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Mexican devaluation hits region's markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's stock market fell heavily yesterday and short-term interest rates
rose sharply following Tuesday's 15 per cent devaluation of the peso,
pulling down other Latin American markets.
Analysts said that while the devaluation was probably a good long-term move
for Mexico's economy, there were immediate questions about new President
Ernesto Zedillo's resolve to maintain a conservative monetary and fiscal
policy. There were also worries about the amount of international reserves
available to the central bank to support the peso.
'The government did something it swore it wasn't going to do,' said Mr Felix
Boni of the Mexican brokerage firm Interacciones. 'Investors don't like
surprises, especially ones like this which are difficult to assimilate.' In
London analysts said investors were worried that the government might be
forced to make a second devaluation.
The IPC index, the main stock market indicator, closed down 3.1 per cent,
recovering from its midday fall of 11.63 per cent. At the weekly auction of
government paper, short-term interest rates rose 2.25 percentage points over
last week to 16 per cent and moved as high as 30 per cent in secondary
trading. The peso continued to trade at or near its maximum lower limit of
4.002 pesos to the dollar, settling at 3.997.
In Argentina the Buenos Aires stock market's blue-chip index closed 5.74 per
cent lower in reaction to the Mexican turbulence. In Brazil, shares on the
Sao Paulo exchange fell 6.3 per cent and the central bank intervened
repeatedly in support of the currency.
The Mexican government had cited political instability related to the armed
conflict in the southern state of Chiapas as one of the reasons behind the
devaluation, rather than economic fundamentals. However, the afternoon
recovery of the stock market was spurred by a international conference call
placed to hundreds of foreign investors by Mr Augustin Carstens of Banco de
Mexico, the central bank, and Mr Carlos Mendoza of Nafin, the state-owned
investment bank, who said the devaluation had an economic basis as well, and
the government would seek to raise additional revenues through an aggressive
privatisation programme.
Mr Carstens and Mr Mendoza acknowledged that the devaluation had also been
intended to protect the country's international reserves, reported to have
fallen to Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn, from Dollars 24.5bn at the beginning of
the year. Analysts said a continued drop in the market would jeopardise
reserves even further.
Mexico's economic cabinet met Mr Zedillo late into the afternoon to define
additional strategies. The government has at its disposal a Dollars 6bn
credit line set up with the US and Canada in March to maintain currency
stability. Finance Ministry officials denied rumours that the line had been
used, but said that it was one of many options being discussed with the
president.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Cardoso names ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who takes over as Brazil's president on
January 1, yesterday named his team of ministers and said they would make
the changes needed 'to put the house in order'.
The 20 ministries were divided almost equally between people appointed for
political reasons and for technical merit. Mr Cardoso had said he wanted the
best ministers possible, but has been forced to make some compromises to
build political support and a working majority in Congress.
The team of economists linked to the Finance Ministry, who oversaw the July
launch of the Real currency, will remain in place, but some will move jobs.
Mr Pedro Malan, central bank governor, will become finance minister. He will
be replaced by Mr Persio Arida, known to favour privatising some of Brazil's
loss-making state banks.
Mr Jose Serra, a leading figure in Mr Cardoso's Social Democracy party
(PSDB), will take over the Planning Ministry, where he will control the
government's budget. Mr Serra has criticised the economic team's strategy of
over-relying on the Real in the fight against inflation. Some analysts
believe he and the team could clash.
Mr Cardoso signalled he would crack down on waste in three of the main
spending ministries. Mr Adib Jatene, a former health minister known for
fighting corruption, returns to Health. Mr Reinhold Stephanes, who began
reforming the social security system, again becomes social security
minister. Mr Paulo Renato da Souza, Mr Cardoso's chief campaign
co-ordinator, takes charge of education.
Mr Raimundo Brito, new mines and energy minister, will have an important
role in privatisations, Mr Nelson Jobim will be justice minister and Mr Luiz
Felipe Lampreia, ambassador to the UN in Switzerland, foreign minister.
Pele, the footballer, will be special secretary for sports.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Cuba cuts budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuba says it has managed to cut its bloated budget deficit in a drive to
balance the state accounts, seven months after launching financial reforms.
But a senior government official said big increases in production and
efficiency were still needed to haul the sugar-exporting economy out of the
doldrums.
Mr Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance minister, told the National Assembly on
Tuesday the state budget deficit had been slashed in 1994 to nearly a
quarter of its 1993 level.
He put the 1994 deficit at 1.4bn pesos (Pounds 897m), 72 per cent lower than
the 1993 deficit of just over 5bn pesos.
The government had boosted revenues by 25 per cent, largely by raising
cigarette and alcohol prices, but also by introducing some taxes and
increasing charges in selected public utilities and services.
Another big saving was achieved in cutting by nearly 40 per cent state
subsidies previously doled out to cover losses in agriculture, basic
industry, construction and local government. Improved financial discipline
by state companies had also helped to lighten the 1994 budget load.
Vice President Carlos Lage said on Saturday he believed the government had
managed to check the sharp decline of the economy that followed the collapse
after 1990 of trade and aid flows from the former Soviet bloc.
The National Assembly on Tuesday approved a budget proposal for 1995 that
further cut the deficit to 1bn pesos, on estimated revenues of 11.68bn pesos
and projected spending of 12.68bn pesos.
While spending on health and education would increase slightly in 1995, the
government would further reduce by nearly 35 per cent subsidies to cover
losses by state companies and institutions
A continuing budget black spot was the heavily subsidised sugar sector,
where, following disastrously low harvests in 1993 and 1994, funds still had
to be set aside to bankroll struggling sugar cane co-operatives.

Speaking after talks with senior government officials in Hanoi yesterday Mr
Wayne Booker, a Ford executive vice-president, would give no details of the

Negotiations on the project are at an advanced stage, following several

Ford, the world's second largest vehicle maker, is joining a queue of
manufacturers either planning to make or already producing vehicles in
Vietnam.
In October, Chrysler announced a Dollars 100m joint venture to build
mini-vans and possibly four-wheel drive vehicles, the first venture by a US
carmaker since the lifting of the US economic embargo on Vietnam this year.
Several international vehicle makers are considering projects in the
country, in spite of difficulties in finding local partners with experience
in the industry.

The European Commission yesterday acted to prohibit price-fixing
arrangements by a group of shipping companies in what could be the first of
many cases against potentially illegal shipping agreements.
Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner responsible for competition policy, said
members of the Far Eastern Freight Conference - a group of 14 shipping
companies - were banned from fixing prices for the land transport of
container cargo.
He ruled that shipping companies were allowed to set common rates for sea
transport but not for the land-based leg of journeys.
The decision means that from now the FEFC will not be allowed to fix prices
with road-haulers and other land-based carriers for the transport of
containers to and from ports within the EU.
The FEFC, one of the world's largest liner shipping conferences, reacted
angrily to the decision and said it would appeal to the European court of
Justice. Its members include P&amp;O Containers, Compagnie Generale Maritime and
Orient Overseas Container Line.
Each of the 14 companies was given a 'symbolic' fine of Ecu10,000 (Dollars
12,100). The commission said this was to mark the existence of the offence
and the need for compliance with EU competition rules.
Mr Patrick Giles, FEFC director-general, said: 'The commission has failed to
recognise the international nature of the trade and has ignored th many
representations of both EU and non-EU governments and shipowners. . . the
stability afforded by the present conference inland tariff is essential.
Thought-through evolution and investment is preferable to abrupt
revolution.'
An existing EU regulation permits shipping companies to fix prices for sea
transport services. But in 1989 the commission received a complaint from the
German Shippers' Council that members of the FEFC were agreeing prices not
only for sea transport but also for inland transport services.
The FEFC is one of many global shipping 'conferences' - the traditional way
in which the world's shipping trade is organised. Others can now expect
similar treatment from the commission. This could lead to a shake-up in the
provision of 'door-to-door' services by shipping companies dealing with
container cargo.
The FEFC argued that all its price-fixing activities were covered by EU
rules that exempted price-fixing for sea transport. Further, it said that
the absence of collective inland rate-fixing would endanger the stabilising
role of liner conferences by undermining the rates set collectively for
maritime services.
The commission rejected these arguments on the grounds that an exemption for
one activity could not justify an exemption for all other revenue-producing
activities. It added that other providers of inland transport services,
which were not allowed to fix prices, were put at a competitive
disadvantage.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Chiapas rebellion: no blood, but no solution - Ted Bardacke
on continuing stalemate in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new government of Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo publicly blamed
Tuesday's devaluation on the continued trouble in the southern state of
Chiapas, site of an armed peasant uprising nearly one year ago. Easing the
pressure on the currency would give the government time to resolve the
violent conflict, officials say.
With tensions rising this week after a rebel 'offensive' and an army
'counter-attack' in which not one shot was fired, the government certainly
needs some space to manoeuvre. On Monday, facing no resistance from federal
troops, members of the rebel Zapatista army and some of their civilian
supporters took over the town of Simojovel and other nearby villages beyond
the military cordon that had been hemming them.
On Tuesday, federal troops took back Simojovel, with the Zapatistas offering
no resistance and heading back into the surrounding jungle.
But although both sides shied away from resuming violence, a long-lasting
settlement in the state is as remote as ever. If anything, the stalemate
that has prevailed since the initial violence of the January rebellion has
deepened.
The Zapatistas, who launched their rebellion demanding increased rights for
indigenous people and greater democracy, have been joined by a plethora of
other groups inspired by or reacting against the uprising.
They range from armed peasants, now nominally allied with the Zapatistas,
specialising in land takeovers, to mercenary armies paid by the state's
powerful ranchers. The federal government, in a sometimes successful attempt
to keep the state's problems out of the national spotlight, has generally
tolerated the actions of these groups.
The unarmed middle of the political spectrum has also become crowded.
Chiapas now has two governors - Mr Eduardo Robledo, the official governor,
and Mr Amado Avendano, a 'parallel' governor recognised by the Zapatistas
and the leftist Democratic Revolutionary party.
Mr Avendano, who claims Mr Robledo won the governorship fraudulently for the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary party in last August's election, has set
up an alternative government which claims the support of between 34 and 58
of the state's 110 municipalities and the military backing of the
Zapatistas.
Both Mr Robledo and Mr Avendano are bent on unilaterally implementing reform
programs in areas controlled by their respective constituencies.
The arrival of new forces in the conflict makes the government's task of
reopening negotiations difficult. 'It feels like Lebanon,' says a European
diplomat. 'So many groups, tiny as they may be, legitimately deserve a place
at the negotiating table. I'm not sure the government can construct a table
big enough and the longer the stalemate is allowed to fester, the bigger the
table is going to have to be.'
Apart from the Zapatistas, at least three other armed peasant groups are
active in the state. They say they will join the Zapatistas if full-scale
war breaks out and have taken over large areas of land.
In response, ranchers have hired mercenaries, some reported to be veterans
of nearby Central American wars, to take back the land, leading to numerous
deadly clashes in both the central and southern parts of the state.
Demobilising these groups will be difficult, as political institutions in
the state are barely functioning. Mr Robledo has adopted an opposition
agenda and promised a new constitution and electoral law, agrarian reform
and respect for indigenous autonomy. He has also offered to resign from his
post as part of a successful negotiated settlement with the rebels.
The response from the opposition has been hostile. In the short term, Mr
Avendano can do little except continue to reject government proposals. He
has no money, announcing on his first day in 'office' that he was going to
lead a government of democratic transition 'as soon as I can find a desk and
chair'.
However, Mr Avendano and his supporters have made one crucial promise - that
everyone in areas adhering to his government will have enough to eat - that
further threatens the stability of the impoverished state.
Since he took office on December 1, Mr Zedillo has unsuccessfully tried
various formulas for opening peace negotiations.
The Zapatistas say that for talks to begin three conditions must be met: Mr
Robledo must resign; Mr Avendano must be recognised as governor; and Bishop
Samule Ruiz, a campaigner for peace in Chiapas, must be the mediator. Each
of these conditions will be difficult for the government to concede,
especially when they guarantee only the opening of negotiations, not their
completion.

FT  22 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Gatt chief to stay as WTO caretaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday agreed to stay on as caretaker head of the World Trade
Organisation until March 15 to allow more time for the selection of his
successor.
Mr Sutherland had previously announced his intention to leave before January
1 when the WTO starts work. He is staying on as caretaker so that trading
powers can break the deadlock between three official candidates seeking the
post.
The candidates for director-general of the WTO are Mr Renato Ruggiero,
former Italian trade minister, Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who left office
as Mexican president earlier this month, and Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's
trade and industry minister.
But with the contest in a stalemate arising from a three-way regional split,
some officials are already considering the possibility of new candidates
emerging with a better chance of securing the required consensus.
Although Mr Kim has run a good campaign, winning support from Japan and
Australia as well as the bulk of Asia, diplomats acknowledge that he has no
chance of winning without the US or the European Union on his side.
The assumption in Geneva is that Washington and Brussels eventually will cut
a deal broadly acceptable to other WTO members - but for the moment neither
is interested in bargaining.
Mr Ruggiero, the European Union candidate, already has the backing of more
than half Gatt's 125 members. However, they are concentrated in Europe and
among poor developing nations with close aid and trade links to the EU.
Brussels is hoping that Mr Kim's supporters will turn to Mr Ruggiero once
their man bows out - but Mr Kim has said he will stay in the race to the
end.
Meanwhile Mr Salinas, with the US, Canada and the whole of Latin America in
support, has barely begun his campaign. Washington was unwilling to lobby
actively on his behalf before the US Senate vote which ratified the WTO
agreement on December 1.
Another factor claimed in Mr Ruggiero's favour - the decision to give the
top job at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in
Paris to a Canadian - is discounted by Mr Salinas' supporters. 'There's no
reason why North Americans should not hold both jobs,' says one. 'Europe did
so for 40 years.'
Mr Sutherland, whose contract ends next June, has said repeatedly he is not
a candidate for the WTO post. Mr Philip Burdon of New Zealand, who did not
run this year, has indicated he might be available if none of the three
declared runners attracted sufficient support.
By late yesterday, 71 countries had ratified the WTO agreement and the
Uruguay Round trade accords, Gatt officials said.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Steadfast support for Vietnam war: Obituary of Dean Rusk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dean Rusk, who died on Tuesday at the age of 85, was US secretary of state
from 1961-69, serving throughout the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
Only Cordell Hull, under Franklin Roosevelt, enjoyed a longer tenure in
nominal charge of US foreign policy. Yet Mr Rusk's reputation ultimately
rests almost entirely on his role in prosecuting the Vietnam war.
He was born on a small farm in Cherokee, Georgia, in 1909. In 1931 he
received a Rhodes Scholarship to St John's College, Oxford. There he
observed what he regarded as a combination of pacifism, isolationism and
public indifference, which, he believed, contributed immeasurably to the
events that that led to the second world war. His later position on Vietnam
was influenced strongly by his view of the 1930s.
He became an associate professor of government, and later dean, at Mills, a
women's college in Oakland, California. During the war, he served in
Washington and New Delhi and by June 1945, as a colonel, was on the war
department general staff. On the night of August 10 1945 he was one of the
two colonels who drew the fateful demarcation line for Korea at the 38th
parallel.
As an assistant secretary of state for UN affairs, he dealt with such issues
as the future of Palestine and the Berlin blockade. He showed little
enthusiasm for an independent new Jewish state and bitterly complained about
what he regarded as excessive 'Zionist' influence at the White House.
He was assistant secretary for far eastern affairs when North Korea invaded
the South in June 1950. and later supported reunification.
He left the State Department for the presidency of the Rockefeller
Foundation. In 1960, President-elect Kennedy, who had never previously met
Mr Rusk, selected him as secretary of state after two short conversations,
largely on the recommendation of senior members of the foreign policy
establishment.
Mr Rusk opposed the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961, although,
characteristically, his disagreement was not public at the time. When the
Berlin Wall went up that year, he believed the western powers should stand
their ground, taking no military action.
But Vietnam came to dominate US foreign policy under Mr Kennedy. Mr Rusk was
convinced that 'southeast Asia was vital to the security of the free world',
and that it was necessary to preserve the independence of South Vietnam.
During the 1964 presidential campaign, he abandoned the traditional
neutrality of the secretary of state by publicly calling for the election of
Lyndon Johnson.
Like President Johnson, he implied that the US would not massively intervene
in Asia. But he strongly supported each subsequent escalation of the US
intervention in Vietnam. When the national consensus in support of the war
came under strain and cabinet members and former senior officials changed
their views, he remained steadfast.
He supported efforts at negotiation but the result he sought never wavered -
he was not prepared to use negotiations to obtain what he viewed as a
camouflaged surrender of the US position.
Despite the war, Mr Rusk was successful in pursuing better relations with
the Soviet Union. The seeds of what came to be called detente were planted
during his tenure.
In 1968, the Nuclear non-proliferation treaty was signed. However, Mr
Johnson's plans to travel to Leningrad by warship for the opening of
strategic arms limitation talks were stymied by the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Mr Rusk left office in January 1969. Because of the unpopularity of his
views on Vietnam, he was not offered an academic position at the most
prestigious universities. In 1970, he became a professor at the University
of Georgia, where he remained until his retirement in 1984. In 1990, his
autobiography, As I Saw It, was published and he remained, to the last,
unrepentant about the policies he had helped forge in the Vietnam war.
President Johnson, to whom Mr Rusk was always closer by temperament and
background than he was to President Kennedy, wrote in 1969: 'The man who has
served me most intelligently, faithfully and nobly is Dean Rusk.' No-one
will quarrel with his faithfulness, but, because of his role in the
Vietnamese tragedy, few will now agree that he served 'most intelligently.'
Dan Davidson, a Washington lawyer, served in the State Department under Dean
Rusk and as a member of the US delegation to the Paris Vietnam peace talks
in 1968.

<TEXT>
India's inflation rate rose in the week ending December 3, adding fresh
grist to the mill of critics of the government's economic policies. Voters
in recent state election in which the ruling Congress (I) party suffered a
serious defeat singled out the high rate of inflation as one of their main
complaints about the central government, prompting demands from some
Congress party members for a change in economic policy. Government figures
published this week show wholesale prices rose 9.75 per cent in the week
ending December 3, compared with the same period last year, up from 9.69 per
cent the previous week. These are provisional figures - the final figures
have recently been running 1 percentage point higher.

Turkmenistan has cut the value of its currency, the manat, to bring the
official and unofficial rates closer together. The new rate, announced on
Tuesday, of 230 manats to the dollar, cuts the rate from the previous
official rate of 10 to the dollar and commercial rate of 75 to the dollar.
The manat, one of the weakest of the new currencies in spite of
Turkmenistan's huge reserves of natural gas, has been devalued by over 90
per cent in stages. The average wage in Turkmenistan is 1,000 manats a
month, though most staples and services are subsidised to very low prices.

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Unexpectedly strong economic growth will allow the New Zealand government to
repay most of its foreign debt within the next four years, Mr Bill Birch,
minister of finance, said. In releasing on Tuesday what he said was the most
positive budget outlook the country had seen in decades, Mr Birch forecast
that the surplus for the financial year to June 30 would be NZDollars 2.3bn
(Pounds 940m), twice the estimate made in the budget in June. The Treasury
estimates that, helped by higher tax income, the surplus will grow to
NZDollars 3.5bn in 1996, to NZDollars 5bn in 1997 and to Dollars NZDollars
7.6bn in 1998.
Mr Birch said that the government will resist pressure to spend the
surpluses on domestic programmes, but will continue to concentrate on
repaying debt and keeping the brakes on inflation, rather than let the
economy steam ahead. This would mean New Zealand could create more jobs and
raise household incomes.

<TEXT>
Australia's Federal Airports Corporation, the government-owned organisation
which runs most of the nation's airports and is coming up for privatisation,
yesterday posted an after-tax profit of ADollars 36m (Pounds 17.9m) in the
year to end-June. The net result compared with ADollars 28.6m in the
previous 12-month period. The FAC said that total numbers handled by the 22
airports under its control rose by 6.2 per cent to around 50m. Pre-tax
earnings were 5 per cent higher at ADollars 94m, while revenues stood at
ADollars 457.2m compared with ADollars 429.8m previously.
Australia's Labor government won approval for the sale of the airports,
reckoned to raise around ADollars 2bn, from rank and file supporters at a
party conference earlier this year. Where possible, however, the airports
will be sold piecemeal rather than in 'bundles', and the properties will be
sold on a long leasehold basis. A number of European groups, including
Britain's BAA, are known to be interested in acquisition, especially for
larger properties.

A World Bank plan to help finance a Dollars 1bn hydro-electric project in
Nepal has come under fire from the bank's own newly established inspection
panel, raising doubts about its ability to become involved in this sector.
The panel, established in November after complaints from four Nepalese, said
in an initial report that the project to dam the Arun river, involved
'apparent violations of policy that require further investigation'. Bank
officials fear that other countries may be discouraged from seeking bank
help for hydro-electric schemes if the project, which Germany and Japanese
companies are to help finance, does not go ahead. China has deliberately
avoided seeking World Bank finance for its controversial Three Gorges dam,
which is much more controversial.

<TEXT>
A car bomb exploded in a Shia Moslem suburb of Beirut yesterday, killing
three people and shattering Lebanon's longest period of calm in two decades.
Hizbollah (Party of God), a militant Shia movement fighting Israeli troops
in south Lebanon, immediately accused Israel of responsibility. It said the
blast in Bir al-Abed, a Hizbollah-dominated district, followed Israeli
threats against the movement in the past few days and mounting tension on
the battle lines in the south. The bomb exploded in a small shopping street
in the impoverished suburb.
It was the first bomb blast in Lebanon outside the southern battlefront with
Israel since February 27 when an explosion in a Maronite church north of
Beirut killed 11 worshippers and injured 50. The bomb ended 10 months of
calm outside the south - the longest period of civic peace most of Lebanon
has enjoyed since the start of the 1975-90 civil war.

<TEXT>
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, predicted last night that the 2m
Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip would go to the polls within
the next few months. He was speaking after a two-hour meeting in Gaza with
the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Mr Yassir Arafat. The
talks failed to resolve their differences, but both men emerged more hopeful
that a compromise would be found. Mr Arafat's chief peace negotiator, Dr
Nabil Sha'ath, who had earlier predicted a crisis if there were no progress,
said that the exchange of ideas had been 'positive'.
The Palestinians have insisted that Israel fulfil its pledge under the 1993
Oslo peace agreement to redeploy its troops from Arab towns and villages on
the still-occupied West Bank before elections to a Palestinian council. But
the Israelis now claim that they need to keep some of them in place to
protect the 110,000 Jewish settlers still living there. The Palestinian
police, they argue, have proved either unwilling or unable to combat a
campaign of violence by Islamic extremists. Mr Arafat acknowledged again
yesterday that the Israelis had reason for concern. Mr Peres reiterated his
government's commitment to the Oslo terms. Negotiations are to be resumed at
senior official level in Cairo next week.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Pride and joy mask problems: Election of radicals to
national executive committee sounds warning to new South African government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As South Africa's President Nelson Mandela ended his address to the ANC
conference's closing session yesterday, the 3,000 delegates broke into song
and dance, full-throatedly rendering an old struggle song praising the
virtues of Mr Mandela and their movement.
The smiles on the faces of the president and his colleagues as they hugged
each other on the podium, and the unrestrained joy and pride of party
activists gathered from around the country, told the same story: despite
fears of clashes between the national executive and local branches over the
slow delivery on election promises and the government's conciliatory
attitude towards whites, the ANC's first national conference since coming to
power in April resulted in a broad endorsement of existing leadership.
Despite a frank admission by Secretary-General Cyril Ramaphosa that the
party had been unprepared for the complex task of being in government, and
remained poorly organised and was losing membership, both he and Mr Mandela,
the incumbent party leader, were re-elected unopposed. Meanwhile, the
ongoing struggle between Mr Ramaphosa and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki over
who is the most likely successor to Mr Mandela was resolved in favour of the
Mr Mbeki; he was elected the party's new deputy president.
While acknowledging it had been remiss in implementing pre-election
promises, especially in areas such as housing and provision of basic
services to black townships, the leadership won general support for its
policies as the party resolved to make 1995, in the words of one delegate,
'the year of delivery'.
Many of the ANC's best-known radicals, including Mr Mandela's estranged
wife, Winnie, were all elected to top positions within the party's National
Executive. But the overwhelming victories by Mr Jacob Zuma in the race for
national chairperson and Ms Cheryl Carolus, as deputy secretary-general, a
Zulu and a Coloured respectively, demonstrated a clear commitment to a
broadly moderate and representative leadership.
The only explicitly hardline position to come from the gathering was the
insistence that the ANC modify somewhat the pre-election agreement
guaranteeing white bureaucrats' jobs for the five-year life of the interim
constitution.
From ministers and local activists alike, the belief that the state
bureaucracy was at best incapable of implementing party policy, and at worst
deliberately sabotaging it, led to widespread calls for dramatically
accelerated appointment of blacks to senior posts.
The conference left several problems unresolved as Mr Ramaphosa's litany of
structural weaknesses was met with little but a promise to do better. In the
absence of a detailed programme to boost recruitment and funding, paid-up
party membership is likely to wither further as the liberation fervour
generated among blacks before the election continues to dissipate.
The party sidestepped discussion on the future of its formal alliance with
the Communist party and Cosatu, the country's biggest trade union
federation.
The linkage is less problematic than formerly - most ANC supporters have
jettisoned all ideological baggage - but it will become increasingly hard to
keep up if the government holds to its tough economic line on tariff reform
and industrial restructuring.
While these shortcomings, and the need to start implementing its centrepiece
Reconstruction and Development Programme, will have to be dealt with over
the coming year, the party and its leaders know these are the challenges of
the future. For now, they are content to revel in the fact that, after 83
years of struggle, they finally have the political wherewithal to address
them.

The national conference of South Africa's ruling African National Congress
put its seal of approval on the government's performance by adopting the
generally moderate platforms drawn up by a series of internal commissions.
But delegates signalled a warning for the future by overwhelmingly electing
some of the party's most radical figures to the party's national executive
committee.
On the closing day of the five-day meeting, most of the resolutions up for
approval passed with little dissent, but in the voting for the 60 directly
elected members to the ANC's ruling body, the top vote-getter was Mr Bantu
Holomisa, former military leader of the Transkei homeland currently deputy
minister of tourism.
Mr Peter Mokaba, former leader of the ANC Youth League, came third, and the
controversial Ms Winnie Mandela, the deputy minister of arts and sciences
and President Nelson Mandela's estranged wife, came fifth.
Along with other prominent ANC members such as Harry Gwala from
KwaZulu-Natal and Tony Yengeni from the Western Cape, both also elected to
the NEC, these three are generally regarded as the most uncontrollable
elements within the party. Despite their grassroots popularity, they were
denied senior cabinet posts following the movement's election victory in
April because of their loose-cannon reputation.
All sitting cabinet members were also elected to the executive body.
The positive response to Mr Mandela's closing address, in which he praised
the degree of consensus achieved at the conference while promising to guard
against corruption in the party and government, reinforced the generally
moderate tone of the triennial conference as it concluded business
yesterday.

FT  22 DEC 94 / N Korea raises hopes for captured US crewman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
North Korea yesterday promised to release the body of a US air force crewman
killed in a helicopter crash inside its territory at the weekend, raising
hopes the surviving crewman might be able to return home for Christmas.
A Pyongyang official news agency statement saying the dead airman would be
handed over soon helped defuse growing tensions in North Korea's relations
with Washington.
North Korea's initial silence on the US request for its crewmen and
helicopter to be returned had raised fears the incident could scupper the
deal struck in October whereby North Korea agreed to dismantle nuclear
facilities that could be used for making weapons.
Mr Bill Richardson, the US congressman negotiating with the North Korean
government, said he expected to bring the remains of Chief Warrant Officer
David Hilemon to South Korea this morning.
US officials said Mr Richardson was optimistic that Chief Warrant Officer
Bobby Hall, who was unharmed but who has been held since the crash, would be
freed in time for Christmas. But North Korea said it was thoroughly
investigating the incident. 'A step will then be taken according to relevant
procedures,' the official news agency said.
The US has argued that the helicopter, well inside North Korean territory
when it came down, strayed over the border by accident. North Korea said it
'was shot down in a self-defensive measure'.
The crash comes at an awkward time. Pyongyang's decision-making is hampered
by uncertainty over the succession to the late President Kim Il Sung. The
North Korean military, believed to have reservations over the rapprochement
with the US, now has an excuse for back-pedalling.
Some analysts believe Pyongyang may also have wanted to use the incident as
a means of forcing the US to sign a formal peace treaty ending the Korean
war of the 1950s. The US believes this is a matter for North and South
Korea.
But Pyongyang's foot-dragging is fanning opposition in the US to the nuclear
deal under which North Korea is to receive financial aid and technology in
return for closing its heavy-water reactors.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Gatt talks failure strains US ties with China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China yesterday sought to put the best face on the failure of Gatt talks in
Geneva but continued its strong criticism of what it termed US
obstructionism.
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation in Beijing accused
the US of breaking its promises of 'staunch support' for China's entry into
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
China's bitter reaction to the failure of the 19th session of the Gatt
working party to reach consensus has also focused attention on Sino-US
relations which are set to come under increasing strain over human rights
and other issues.
Chinese officials have been expressing concern privately about the election
of a Republican-dominated Congress and the prospect of figures like Senator
Jesse Helms playing a more decisive role in shaping China policy. Senator
Helms, who is expected to be the new chairman of the Senate foreign
relations committee, has a long history of antipathy towards China and has
consistently opposed renewal of China's most favoured nation trade status
(MFN).
After reversing its position this year on linkage between human rights and
MFN, the administration has been taking a firmer line towards China  -
partly because the business lobby, which urged MFN renewal, was also
demanding a tough stance at the Gatt negotiations.
Mr Winston Lord, the assistant secretary of state, said on Tuesday that
President Bill Clinton would not accept an invitation to visit Beijing next
year unless there is 'further progress on a whole range of issues' including
human rights. There have been published reports that Vice-President Al Gore
might go to Beijing, but these were denied yesterday by his press office.
Political relations will continue to be prickly, but the countries appear to
want to avoid a dangerous break. Last week, reports surfaced of a
confrontation between a US warship and a Chinese submarine off the Chinese
coast. The incident was played down in Washington, indicating that he
administration did not want to push Beijing too far.
US officials in Beijing were seeking yesterday to play down negative fallout
from the argument over Gatt. 'While we would have liked to see a lot more
progress especially on market access negotiations, the door has not been
closed,' said one official. 'Nobody has walked away from the table.'
In Washington, Mr Lord said the US 'genuinely' wishes to see China in the
Gatt and the World Trade Organisation, the successor organisation. 'We have
indicated a willingness to try to find some procedure whereby if they get in
later, they could still be a founding member of the WTO,' he said. 'That's
to underline our sincerity in wanting them in this organisation.'
Chinese officials insist 'the conditions for re-entry into Gatt are fully
ripe which constitutes the most important reason why China's re-entry has
gained extensive support,' the Moftec spokesman said.
But western officials in Beijing said that China appeared to have seriously
miscalculated requirements for Gatt entry and was now reduced to 'bluster'
in an attempt to disguise responsibility for the failure.
These officials also blame political uncertainties in Beijing with signs
that the end may be drawing near for Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader,
for Chinese inflexibility in Geneva.
China's leaders may be unwilling in the present uncertain political climate
to risk criticism from entrenched economic interests likely to be affected
by the continued liberalisation of the economy.
'The top people (in China) want to be in the WTO,' an Asian diplomat in
Washington said. 'But the vested interests know the price. The state
industries would lose their protection and their subsidies.'
Beijing's disappointing offer on market access in both the services and
agricultural sectors is one of the main stumbling blocks to a resolution of
the Gatt dispute.
But China and the US face an early hurdle in what may well prove to be a
difficult new phase in their relations. The suspension of talks last week on
intellectual property rights threatens a serious argument over copyright
issues.
Although the US succeeded in nudging China into strengthening its
intellectual property laws, the difficulty arises over enforcement. US
officials understand that this is partly a problem of the central government
being unable to impose its will on the provinces, the Asian diplomat said.
In any case, the US trade representative has put China on a priority list of
foreign countries infringing copyright covenants and given it until January
1 to put its house in order. The talks appear to be stalled and, without
agreement, the US will release a list of possible sanctions, which would
further complicate Gatt discussions. Chinese officials yesterday were at
pains to emphasise that, in spite of the disappointment in Geneva, Beijing
remained committed to economic reform.

<TEXT>
Negotiations on Taiwan's application to join the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade have moved into the final stage, making it virtually
certain that Taipei will be ready for admission to Gatt's successor, the
World Trade Organisation, at the same time as China, writes Frances Williams
in Geneva. Taiwan's Gatt bid was accepted in 1992 on the understanding it
could not join the world trade body before Beijing. However, unlike China's
gruelling eight-year membership talks, negotiations with Taiwan have made
steady progress. Yesterday's meeting of the Gatt working party on entry
terms agreed to start drafting the protocol of accession, after hearing that
bilateral talks on access to Taiwanese markets for foreign goods and
services were going well. Taiwan says it hopes to complete the bilateral
talks early next year and accession proceedings 'at the earliest
possibility'.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Day belongs to Russians ..Night to Chechens: The breakaway
republic may lose to superior arms but it has determined guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bayonet protruding from a breast pocket, grenades strapped around his
middle and a rifle slung across a shoulder, Mr Musa Israilov, speaks
earnestly: 'They want to bring us up like Russians,' he complains, the
creases around his eyes deepening, 'but we are not Russian.'
In the soupy fog surrounding the Chechen capital of Grozny, Mr Israilov's
simple observation has a clarity of reasoning that is at the heart of the
first war on Russian soil since 1945. It is a violent debate over the very
roots of Russia's conquering traditions, and the widespread regional
resentment challenging its right to rule. President Boris Yeltsin has
highlighted that threat by ordering the army to pull the breakaway republic
of Chechnya back into the Russian Federation.
With its stark backdrop of black mountains and thick woods, Chechnya is
among 20 ethnic regions conquered by Russians in the last three centuries.
The region's mountain people have fiercely resisted Russian military might
and customs since Muscovite forces first appeared there in the early 19th
century. They now appear unlikely to succumb easily.
In Moscow, there are colourful anecdotes slandering the Chechens; they are
gangsters at heart; dark men in pinstripe suits and fedoras who aspire to be
Godfather figures; they run drugs and terrorise innocents. But the Chechens'
declaration of independence, made when the Soviet Union broke up in 1991,
has given the reputed image a sharp edge.
You do find firearms in Chechnya, so many and in such variety that you
quickly wonder what made Moscow believe its invasion would by any scope of
the imagination be surgical and quick. There are no pinstripes or fedoras in
sight, however. Instead, the hospitable Chechens appear genuinely grateful
that someone is willing to investigate whether indeed they are the monsters
of Russian literature and contemporary gossip.
'They think our president, who we elected, is a bandit just because he
doesn't obey them,' says Mr Ruslan Bedsiev, 26, one of Mr Israilov's men.
'We are peaceful people. We don't want a war.'
The Chechens, a Moslem Turkic people, deeply resent Moscow's 140 years of
occupation. Indeed, among the most powerful images in Grozny is a small
square that is obtrusive in its fresh modernity against the city's dour
appearance.
It is the site of a grim memorial to Stalin's 'Operation Mountain' - the
1944 deportation of the entire Chechen population to Kazakhstan, including
the current president, Mr Dzhokar Dudayev. Stalin accused the Chechens of
supporting the Nazi invasion, a claim most historians dispute. More likely,
Stalin was upset that the Chechens exploited the invasion in their perennial
quest for independence.
A plaque claims that 380,000 Chechens died in the deportation - either
murdered or through disease - and the memorial consists of 6,000
gravemarkers that the Soviets uprooted and used as paving stones. Hundreds
of broken pieces of gravestones are piled like rubble in the centre, out of
which protrudes a giant, sculpted fist.
'Lots of people were dying. It was crazy freezing cold,' said one survivor,
a man identifying himself as Abdullah. He was, he says, nine when Soviet
soldiers arrived to take the Chechens away. 'The Communists among us said
Stalin didn't know, and that he would return us home.'
You cannot visit the Chechen front lines, Grozny's bazaars or ordinary homes
without hearing the tales of deportation. Mr Israilov, the front-line
commander, his eyes narrowing, warns: 'We're not going to Siberia this
time.'
The Chechens are resisting. They no doubt will lose the capital against
Moscow's superior arms, however, but appearances indicate that the conflict
will lead to a protracted, Islamic-tinged guerrilla war resembling the
Soviet debacle in Afghanistan.
In one village near Grozny, a stocky, determined businessman named Ayub
Khansultanov, 30, lives with four older brothers. Every night at about 11,
Mr Khansultanov leaves his large brick home, armed with anti-tank weapons
and grenades and Soviet-era versions of the American, ground-to-air stinger
missile made famous during the Afghan war, and early every morning he
returns, exhausted.
He does not say where he is going or has been, only that about 150 Chechens
make up his fighting force. 'The day belongs to the Russians, the night
belongs to us.'
If the scene in the Khansultanov house and the surrounding village is being
mirrored elsewhere in Chechnya, the Russians indeed will face a long, bloody
war. Mr Khansultanov says as much. 'Now the thing begins. In Chechnya, war
can last a lifetime.'
The Chechens have found unlikely partners among the invading Russian forces.
Some of the Russian officers have found that the Chechen people are not the
reprehensible people widely depicted back home. Others simply have not
managed to summon up the motivation that former Russian armies found for
such operations.

FT  22 DEC 94 / The general with hot line to Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A letter from General Alexander Korzhakov, head of President Boris Yeltsin's
security service, to Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister,
reveals a bitter struggle within the government over the direction of
economic reform.
It also shows the power of Gen Korzhakov in areas far beyond his
jurisdiction. The general, to whom Mr Yeltsin has referred in his recent
memoirs as his closest and most trusted aide, is seen by politicians and
other observers as wielding immense power.
The letter, a copy of which has been obtained by the FT, directs Mr
Chernomyrdin to review decisions to liberalise oil exports, which will
narrow the huge gap between domestic and world prices for oil. This is a key
issue for both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in
granting loans to Russia. Both the bank and the Fund have recently voiced
concern that a plan to introduce domestic quotas for oil distribution will
be more restrictive than the existing quotas on exports which are to be
lifted.
Earlier this week, the Fund's deputy director for Eastern Europe, Mr Ernesto
Hernandez-Cata, said that 'we are completely against this proposal'.
In the letter, Gen Korzhakov opposes government orders drawn up by Mr
Alexander Shokhin, the former deputy prime minister who resigned last month,
and signed by Mr Chernomyrdin. They had promised to liberalise exports and
to allow non-discriminatory access to oil pipelines for foreign oil
companies as a precondition of further loans by the bank.
Gen Korzhakov writes that: 'The national economy cannot be strengthened by
foreign intervention in the raw material branches of the economy, which make
up 60 per cent of Russian exports. The creation of a so-called
'non-discriminatory' access to the pipeline capacity of the oil sector of
the economy (in accordance with the demands of the World Bank) means  ..the
imposing of a financial agreement profitable to the World Bank, but not for
Russia'.
Noting that proposed loans to an oil project in Priobsky in Western Siberia
(Dollars 500m) and the coal industry (Dollars 500m) would 'increase
dependence on foreign capital', Gen Korzhakov says that the effect would be
to lower the competitiveness of Russia's export potential in this area.
'That is wholly inadmissible both for the political and for the economic
consequences on the country.'
He adds: 'We believe it sensible to propose that you entrust first deputy
prime minister (Oleg) Soskovets ..to set up a commission to work out an
expert view on all the afore-mentioned orders from the point of view of
their accordance with national strategy in the area of oil policy and the
strengthening of the country's economy.'
The 'we' in the last paragraph is not defined, but the letter is headed with
the title 'Security Service of the President of the Russian Federation', and
is signed by Gen Korzhakov. Those who have seen the letter - which is
alarming reformers in the government - do not question its authenticity. The
government orders he quotes - signed on August 29, August 30 and September
30 - are all accurately described.
Gen Korzhakov was at the centre of another incident earlier this month when
security service forces questioned and beat up the personal guard of Mr
Vladimir Gusinsky, chairman of the Most Financial Group. Though President
Yeltsin apologised, no inquiry appears to have been held.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Grozny's citizens man barricades as toll reaches 140
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to the Chechen people - whom he
said were 'hostages' to the regime of President Dzhokar Dudayev  - to hand
over their weapons.
The fighting continued in the suburbs of Grozny while planes bombed selected
targets in the capital, as estimates of the civilian death toll reached 140
yesterday.
Independent accounts do not back up Russian statements that the population
is being forced to support General Dudayev and that his forces have left the
city. Reports from Reuters correspondents who remain in or near Grozny point
to a general and voluntary mobilisation of a sizeable proportion of the
adult population, now preparing defences at various points in and around the
capital.
President Yeltsin's statement stressed that the rumours spread by General
Dudayev's officials that the government had a plan to deport the Chechens -
recalling the murderous deportations of 1944 under Stalin - were baseless.
Mr Yeltsin also promised economic aid to Chechnya once the fighting stopped
 -a promise causing concern among financial officials in Moscow. Mr Vladimir
Panskov, the finance minister, said yesterday that the war had so far cost
Rbs400bn and that at least Rbs1,000bn would be spent on reconstruction next
year - a sum which he said may rise.
France became the first major western state to voice concern over the
Chechen intervention - breaking the consensus which has held the matter to
be purely internal to Russia. Ms Lucette Michaux-Chevry, the deputy minister
for human rights, said she shares worries expressed by the Red Cross 'on the
fate of the Chechen population.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Bonn goes it alone on foreign workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Germany is to go ahead unilaterally with national rules on the rights of
foreign workers, after European social affairs ministers failed yesterday to
agree minimum European-wide employment rights for people working outside
their own country.
Construction workers from the EU's poorer member states could be badly hit
by the German move and the likely free-for-all of tougher national rules it
looks set to unleash.
The main cause of yesterday's failure is the UK's doctrinal opposition to EU
action in this area, although Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Italy have
problems with details in the EU directive, which they say does not offer
so-called 'posted' workers sufficient protection. Britain's opposition could
now lead to more stringent measures being taken by individual states.
Mr Norbert Blum, German employment minister and president of the EU Social
Affairs Council, said he would discuss national rules at a meeting with
German employers and unions today.
Commission officials say foreigners working 'on the black' in Germany's
building industry, undercutting wages for local workers, 'amounts to 80 per
cent of the problem' the posted workers' directive is intended to deal with.
Mr Blum said after yesterday's last-ditch special meeting in Brussels that
guaranteeing the 'same wages for the same work in the same place is
absolutely elementary, or we are going back to the 19th century. We could
just sit around and wait until we have a European policy,' he added, but 'I
am paid to act'.
Germany wanted an agreement yesterday, to be able to have at least one
success to exhibit in an EU presidency it hoped would be strong on social
policy. But Bonn's purposes are just as well served by a failure which
justifies unilateral action.
Mrs Ann Widdecombe, UK employment minister, said: 'We should be looking at
creating jobs in Europe, not messing about trying to impose uniform
conditions.'
France, which takes over the EU presidency next month, looks set to have one
more try for an agreement. But next year's EU entry of Austria, Sweden and
Finland, all of whom back the plan, could lead to the objectors being
outvoted.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Gonzalez haunted by anti-Basque operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The shadowiest episode of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's tenure of office has returned
10 years later to haunt Spain's prime minister, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
How much did he and his government know about an undercover war fought by
French and Portuguese mercenaries, who styled themselves as GAL, the
Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups, against members of Eta, the Basque
separatist organisation, in south west France between 1983, the year after
Mr Gonzalez took power, and 1986?
It was then that the picturesque villages and towns of France's Cote Basque,
just across the border from Spain and long a safe haven zone for Eta
members, were wracked by a shooting and bombing campaign that ended as
abruptly as it had started.
The events are now being relived in a legal investigation that has severely
embarrassed Mr Gonzalez and threatens to rock his government.
Eta was at the time extremely active and the mysterious GAL suddenly
appeared on the scene to carry the separatist violence into France. Every
terrorist action in Spain extracted, within days, its retribution with a
tit-for-tat incident in St Jean-de-Luz, Biarritz, Hendaye and other
locations across the border.
The undercover war ceased when, in a reversal of its previous policy, the
French authorities began to round up Eta suspects and hand them over
directly to Spanish police. Eta continues its violence to this day but the
Cote Basque is no longer its sanctuary.
In all GAL claimed 23 fatal victims, among them several leading Eta members.
Between 1987 and 1988 courts in France and in Portugal brought charges
against more than 20 GAL members some of whom helped to identify Spanish
policemen Mr Jose Amedo and Mr Michel Dominguez, who were then attached to
an intelligence unit in the Basque city of Bilbao.
In 1991 Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez received long prison terms after a Madrid
court upheld evidence that they had recruited gunmen in mercenary circles
and organised them into the GAL death squad.
The court absolved the administration of any involvement in GAL's sinister
activities and Mr Gonzalez said at the time there 'is no proof and never
will be' incriminating his government.
This week the investigating judge who brought the two policeman to court,
and who decided in September to re-opened the dirty war case, has indicted
and committed to prison the director general of state security between 1984
and 1986 and two former senior counter-terrorism officers on charges that
they created GAL.
Yesterday the respected Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia headlined a report
on its front page saying that the legal probe, conducted by Madrid high
court judge Baltasar Garzon would extend up through the administration
hierarchy to include Mr Jose Barrionuevo, a stalwart of Mr Gonzalez's
Socialist party, who was interior minister between 1982 and 1988.
The government's chief spokesman has said the indictments had 'surprised'
the government but that it would maintain a 'prudent silence' over judge
Garzon's investigations.
Mr Barrionuevo has not remained silent. He has visited Mr Julian
Sancristobal, the former security boss, in prison and in a succession of
statements he has said he stands fully by his former aide and the other
former counter-terrorism chiefs.
In a radio interview Mr Barrionuevo rhetorically asked whether in other
countries that faced a terrorism threat such as that posed by Eta 'people
who fought against that terrorism with considerable personal sacrifice would
be treated as they are here.'
The problem that Mr Barrionuevo, and possibly Mr Gonzalez himself, face is
that if there was a GAL cover-up, it is now, for two reasons, likely to be
blown wide open.
One is that Judge Garzon, Spain's foremost legal celebrity, is a persistent
investigator who is said by his supporters to be 'a man with a mission' and
who is accused of 'wanting to settle scores' by associates of Mr
Barrionuevo.
In 1993 he hung up his judge's toga to run on Mr Gonzalez's ticket in the
general elections and was given a senior job in the interior ministry. Later
judge Garzon resigned his parliamentary seat to resume his legal career
saying the government was not doing enough about corruption.
The other reason is that Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez, who were transferred to
an open prison in July as part of a partial amnesty package that involved
jailed Eta members, have decided to co-operate fully with judge Garzon
following his decision to resume the investigation into GAL.
The two former policemen were questioned at length last week by the judge
and they were subsequently cross-examined together with Mr Sancristobal and
the other indicted former security chiefs.
Yesterday Judge Garzon, in a further twist to the GAL scandal, ordered the
indefinite release from prison of Mr Amedo and Mr Dominguez, saying he
wished to safeguard their security.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Brussels to ease curbs on cable TV networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday announced plans to liberalise cable
television networks across the Union, clearing the way for new electronic
services such as home shopping and interactive education.
Brussels intends to force through the legislation - which aims to give
service providers free access to cable infrastructures by January 1 1996 -
using special powers allowing it to circumvent the Council of Ministers. The
move reflects the Commission's determination to speed the liberalisation of
the EU's telecommunications sector. It fears monopolistic structures are
damaging competitiveness.
Cable infrastructures are widespread in Germany, Belgium, Denmark, the
Netherlands and, to an extent, France but have only been fully liberalised
in the UK. In most of these states, existing national regulations restrict
the use of cable networks to traditional television broadcasting.
The Commission's proposals will lift these curbs, allowing other interactive
services such as home catalogue browsing, banking, interactive video games
and on-line databases to develop. The proposals will not extend to
traditional voice telephone services; under a previous Commission rule these
will not be liberalised until January 1 1998, although individual member
states are free to push ahead on their own.
Yesterday, Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner responsible for competition,
said the draft law would allow service providers to shop around for better
deals.
'At the moment they have to rent lines from the telecoms operator. Sometimes
the prices they offer are 10 per cent higher than in countries where there
is competition, such as the US,' he said. 'Service providers suffer from a
tremendous handicap because they often have to go to a monopoly supply of
these services.' The European Cable Communications Association welcomed the
move. 'This marks a breakthrough for cable and multimedia in Europe. The
directive offers new perspectives for the cable industry,' it said.
Although the Council of Ministers will not vote formally on the draft
directive, it will be consulted, as will the European parliament. At the
last telecoms council meeting, strong backing for plans to force through
cable network deregulation came from France, the UK, and Germany.
Denmark and Belgium, plus those member states where cable infrastructures
have yet to develop, are not in favour. They are worried the Commission's
plans will set a precedent for other monopolistic networks.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Top German telecom official sacked
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis over management and regulation in Germany's telecommunications
sector sharpened yesterday with the sacking of the chief architect of the
government's liberalisation programme.
Mr Peter Bross, the top postal ministry official responsible for strategy,
tariffs and regulatory matters, was yesterday forced into 'temporary
retirement' after disputes with his seniors. Mr Bross, 44, was removed by a
little-used regulatory device for displacing public officials, who are
commonly protected by a jobs-for-life guarantee.
His departure follows the equally unexpected resignation for 'purely
personal reasons' earlier this month of Mr Helmut Ricke, chairman of the
state monopoly Deutsche Telekom, and last week's rejection by Mr Tyll
Necker, outgoing head of the confederation of German industry, of a seat on
Telekom's supervisory board.
Officials commenting on the sequence yesterday suggested a crisis of
confidence at the most senior level in the commitment of Mr Wolfgang Botsch,
post minister, and his state secretary, Mr Gerhard Pfeffermann, to
deregulation in the telecoms market.
Mr Botsch has said he is committed to free competition in the German
telecoms market by 1998, but 'that is not much help when no one knows what
is going to be liberalised or how,' one critic said yesterday.
Bankers preparing for the first tranche of Telekom's privatisation, due in
mid-1996, said the disruption at management and political level was unlikely
to affect the projected share sale, but it would be helpful if the
government could in future make a start on preparing the new legislation
necessary for supervising the telecoms market after privatisation.
Mr Bross, an ardent promoter of orderly liberalisation in the telecoms
market, has played a leading role in changes such as the successful
introduction of private-sector competition in mobile telephones.
He has often complained that present legislation is designed to turn Telekom
from a state to a private monopoly without allowing the private sector a
chance to compete on equal terms.
Observers yesterday reported 'friction and discord' had been apparent
between Mr Bross and Mr Pfeffermann for many months. 'He was one of our best
people,' one said. The fact he had been removed because of a purely
political decision should be seen as a sign that telecoms liberalisation was
not the government's main aim,' another stated.
Mr Pfeffermann, recently appointed to Deutsche Telekom's supervisory board,
was also the reason for Mr Necker's rejection of a supervisory post. Mr
Necker's complaint of a conflict of interest between Mr Pfeffermann's
ministry role as a telecoms industry regulator and as a representative of
Telekom's owners was dismissed as incomprehensible by Mr Botsch.
Mr Ricke, yet to be replaced, has refused to explain his decision to quit,
announced earlier this month two days after the post ministry said five
politicians were to be given seats on Telekom's supervisory board.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Carter's mission impossible offers scant hope
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
If the guns fall silent in Bosnia tomorrow, Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US
president, can pat himself on the back for his mediation efforts. However,
there seems little hope of the warring parties agreeing the conditions of a
long-term peace.
In a three-day diplomatic shuttle around former Yugoslavia, Mr Carter
announced yesterday he had secured the agreement of the Bosnian Serbs and
the Moslem-led Bosnian government for a four-month ceasefire in a country
where truces seldom last more than a few hours.
Mr Carter also said he had obtained agreements from both parties to release
all prisoners taken in their 32-month-old war. 'Both sides agreed to let the
International Red Cross come in, inspect the prisons, inspect all the prison
camps, and inventory the prisoners, and it calls for an immediate release,
total release of all prisoners of war by both sides,' he said in Atlanta.
However, he stressed the ceasefire agreement was only a tentative pact. 'The
whole thing can very easily come apart,' he said.
The two sides pledged to hammer out, over the next fortnight, the specific
details of a cessation of hostilities. However, even before the ink was dry
on the agreement, last night Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader,
predicted it would be stillborn if Bosnian-government forces failed to
withdraw from strategic heights around the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, which
are UN demilitarised zones.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, warned that the Serbs were using
the Carter talks as a foil while their forces tightened their stranglehold
around Bihac, a Moslem enclave in the north-west. He endorsed the ceasefire,
but said he saw no chance for peace.
The time is right for a ceasefire, as neither side wants to fight a war as
the harsh Balkan winters grips Bosnia. But the leaders of both sides appear
convinced that war is preferable to compromise.
The Bosnian government clings to the five-nation Contact Group's plan it
accepted last July, giving the Moslem-Croat federation 51 per cent of Bosnia
and the rest to Serbs, who now control 70 per cent.
The Moslem-led government, by its own admission, accepted the plan as the
Serbs were bound to reject it. They are holding out for salvation from
abroad, perhaps military intervention. The Sarajevo government remains
convinced the incoming Republican majority in the US Congress will vote to
lift the arms embargo.
The Bosnian Serbs, as the stronger group, see no reason to accept the maps
foisted on them by the Contact Group. They have withstood an embargo imposed
on them in August by their former mentor, President Slobodan Milosevic of
Serbia.

France, along with Britain, should consider extending the umbrella of their

Lamassoure, the French European affairs minister, said yesterday. Addressing
a Franco-German conference in Paris, where, Mr Lamassoure was careful to say
it was only his 'personal wish' that Paris and London should extend their
current bilateral discussions on nuclear doctrine to include a European role
for their nuclear weapons. But he stressed the Balladur government's desire
that the EU's planned 'treaty of 1996 should do for foreign and defence
policy what the 1992 (Maastricht) treaty did for money' in planning a single
currency. The French minister also outlined, before several leading German
politicians, his blueprint to make European institutions more workable and
democratic by boosting the importance of the Council of Ministers, while
rendering it more accountable to the European Parliament.

<TEXT>
A knock-on effect from Italy, plus addition to home-grown political unease,
put the Spanish markets under pressure yesterday for the second consecutive
day. Investor nervousness has been triggered brought on by separate legal
probes that centring on the collapse a year ago of Banesto, Spain's
fourth-largest bank at the time, and on an alleged government cover-up in an
undercover war directed in the 1980s against Basque separatists which has
led to the imprisonment this week of three former senior interior ministry
officials. The peseta remained very weak, trading at Pta84.48 against the
D-Mark, the yield on 10-year bonds kept hovering at a high level near of
around 11.50 per cent, and Spain's stock market general index fell further
to 291.59. Fuelling the selling pressure, the Treasury raised six-month bill
yields in order to bring them closer to money market rates. Traders said the
domestic market faced the additional burden of being bracketed with Italy -
'we're trapped in the garlic belt,' said one - although Spain had acceptable
economic fundamentals and a far more stable political environment.

<TEXT>
The French government has set up a committee to examine reforming the rules
governing stock options after recent criticism of the remuneration of senior
company executives. Stock options give the recipient the right to buy shares
in a company at a future date at a fixed price, usually below the market
rate when they can exercise this right. They allow pay to be partly tied to
performance, as measured by a company's share price, and are subject to
favourable taxes in France: 19.4 per cent capital gains tax against a
marginal tax rate of nearly 60 per cent for highly paid executives.
Mr Jean Arthuis, a member of the French Senate, urged tougher tax rules on
stock options when the latest finance bill passed through the legislative
body last month. His Mr Arthuis' concern was partly triggered by a fear that
the rules on options have been exploited by companies and their advisers.
The rules were changed when some executives were becoming eligible to
exercise previously-awarded options and did not want to have to wait before
selling their shares.
He said the new committee will examine issues including the disclosure of
options. Mr Arthuis' proposal is to reintroduce income tax on the capital
gains made when options are sold by executives, unless they have waited at
least one year after the options were granted before selling them. This
requirement was repealed by law last year.

The French government has set up a committee to examine reforming the rules
governing stock options following recent criticism of the remuneration of
senior company executives.
Stock options give the recipient the right to buy shares in a company at a
future date at a fixed price, which is usually below the market rate at the
time they can exercise this right. They allow pay to be partially tied to
performance - as measured by a company's share price  - and are subject to
favourable taxes in France: just 19.4 per cent capital gains tax compared
with a marginal tax rate of nearly 60 per cent for highly paid executives.
Mr Jean Arthuis, a member of the French senate, called for tougher tax rules
on stock options when the latest finance bill passed through the legislative
body last month. Mr Arthuis' concern was partly triggered by a fear that the
rules on options have been exploited by companies and their advisers. The
rules were changed at a time when a number of senior executives were
becoming eligible to exercise the options awarded to them in earlier years
and did not want to have to wait before selling their shares.
Mr Arthuis's proposal is to reintroduce income tax on the capital gains made
when options are sold by executives, unless they have waited at least one
year after the options were granted before selling them. This requirement
was repealed by law last year and currently only capital gains tax is
imposed.
The French ministry of finance stressed that manipulations of stock options
would be severely punished, but that control was more likely to be achieved
through the tax authorities than legislation.
'There has been a fear that some people have been manipulating the rules,'
said Mr Eduardo de Martino, of accountants Arthur Andersen, yesterday. 'But
there have been no cases in the courts. Let's try to find out the people who
have done it rather than changing the rules.'
The renewed examination of stock options comes as a growing number of French
companies are using them as a way to remunerate senior executives. Although
first permitted in the 1970s, Mr de Martino said options had gained
popularity in the last few years with buoyancy on the stock markets.

FT  22 DEC 94 / EU rift takes steam out of energy taxes: Dispute on carbon
levy weakens greenhouse gases campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If this month's European Union summit in Essen put the lid on the coffin of
a common energy tax, last week's meeting of environment ministers drove in
the final nail.
By allowing member states to follow individual strategies on energy
taxation, rather than imposing a common tax based on a fuel's carbon
content, the decision dealt an embarrassing blow to the EU's prestige ahead
of the most important international gathering on climate change - due next
March in Berlin - since the Rio de Janeiro earth summit of 1992. In Rio,
western industrialised nations agreed to stabilise their emissions of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO), which many scientists believe
cause global warming. The Berlin conference is intended to take the process
further.
Progress was never going to be easy given the diversity of national
positions. But preparation of a new protocol to go beyond the Rio commitment
to stabilise CO emissions in the year 2000 at 1990 levels now looks less
likely in view of the EU's internal dissent.
A joint European front at Rio was a crucial element in pushing a reluctant
US to accept CO cuts. It also sent a message to the developing world, which
made no such commitment, that its turn would come. Discord within the EU
will make it easier for both to seek a fudge in Berlin.
Mr Michael Grubb, who heads the energy and environmental programme at
Britain's Royal Institute of International Affairs, believes the writing has
been on the wall for the EU for some time. While a carbon tax appealed to
the most environmentally-minded member states, such as the Netherlands and
Denmark, it was viewed with trepidation by others. For Germany, which
generates most of its electricity from coal, a carbon-based levy was a boon
to trading competitors, such as France, where electricity is derived
predominantly from other sources.
This explains Bonn's concern to turn the carbon tax into a wider duty on all
energy sources. Under a compromise, the European Commission proposed the tax
should be on a fuel's carbon content and its energy value. According to the
German government, which was keen to head off criticism from the powerful
Green lobby and prepare for the Berlin conference, that would discourage the
use of polluting carbon and stimulate energy efficiency as well.
Not all the member states thought likewise. While Spain, Greece, Ireland and
Portugal all accepted the idea in principle, each demanded exceptional
treatment to give it greater headroom for industrial development.
British opposition, meanwhile, turned on the issue of sovereignty. The
government argued that taxation was a domestic issue and that individual
states should decide how to implement their Rio commitments.
Not surprisingly, the outcome at Essen was an agreement to disagree. EU
finance ministers were told to prepare criteria for a member state to apply
a common tax 'if it so desires'. That leaves the EU facing a pot pourri of
measures ahead of the Berlin conference. Denmark, along with Sweden and
Finland, which are due to join the EU, already apply varying forms of
wide-ranging energy taxes and special levies for carbon-based fuels.
Germany and the Netherlands have also taken steps to impose duties. However,
the German preparations for a carbon tax were dropped in favour of EU
action, while the Netherlands, which has already imposed some environmental
taxes, is committed to introducing some form of carbon tax by January 1996.
The Belgian cabinet, meanwhile, decided recently in favour of a broad energy
tax to meet CO targets. For some government officials, the carbon tax was
nothing more than a sideshow from the outset given national differences and
the string of exemptions agreed. 'The whole debate was just a distraction
which was always going to be controversial,' says one.
However, energy taxation may be more tenacious than its opponents think.
France, which is about to take over the presidency of the Council of
ministers, seems inclined to resurrect a German scheme to use existing
excise taxes on energy, normally restricted to petroleum, as the basis for a
new EU levy.
Member states would first be required to impose a minimum EU level of
taxation on petrol. That would be reviewed periodically to harmonise
national tax levels. The tax would gradually be extended beyond petrol to
other energy sources.
Critics say the scheme is so riddled with exemptions that it is of little
practical value. However, the fact that energy taxation remains on the
agenda suggests that its coffin may not yet be at rest.

The EU's rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, was an
annualised 3 per cent for the third consecutive month in November, according
to Eurostat, the EC statistical office. The level, the lowest for more than
seven years, was 3.1 per cent in August and July after remaining at 3.2 per
cent from March to June. The rate was last at this level in March 1987 and
peaked at 6.3 per cent in October 1990. It touched 3.4 per cent last
December/January. The figures show France still has the lowest inflation
rate in the EU, with a provisional 1.6 per cent. Only Italy, Portugal, Spain
and Greece are above the EU average.
France had a seasonally adjusted trade surplus in October of FFr11.28bn
(Pounds 1.33bn), against a revised surplus in September of FFr9.07bn,
provisional customs office data show. The office had originally reported a
surplus in September of FFr9.19bn. Economists had forecast a surplus for
October of about FFr7.2bn.
Spain's accumulated budget deficit on a cash basis shrunk 3.8 per cent to
Pta2,850bn (Pounds 13.8bn) in the first 11 months of 1994, from Pta2,740bn
in the same period in 1993, the Finance Ministry said yesterday.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Rate review will harm London, says City: Relief scheme to
soften impact for northern cities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's international competitiveness will be damaged by next year's
business rates revaluation, the Corporation of London said yesterday as the
first details of new rateable values were revealed to local authorities.
Rateable values for inner London offices have been cut by 59 per cent in the
new revaluation, which takes account of the decline in the property market
since 1988, when the last revaluation took place. But the transitional
relief scheme announced last month in the Budget means that cuts in rate
bills for large buildings will be limited to 5 per cent after inflation.
The relief scheme is meant to soften the impact of the revaluation on
northern properties, where rateable values for office blocks will increase
by 50 per cent on average. Next year, increases in rates payable will be
limited to 10 per cent, indexed for inflation (7.5 per cent for small
business properties).
London businesses will in effect pay for this relief by foregoing cuts in
rateable value.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources
committee, said: 'Clearly ministers have decided there's political benefit
in giving Treasury money to northern cities yet again.'
The corporation said the rates bill for one office block in Bishopsgate
would only drop from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 5.2m next April, when the new
values come into force. If the transitional relief scheme had not been in
operation, the rates bill would have fallen to Pounds 2.7m.
Mr Cassidy added: 'We were planning to use the prospective reduction in
rates as one of our selling points to attract businesses into London.
There's a perception abroad that the property tax burden in the UK makes us
less competitive.'
Figures from the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation, the
professional body of surveyors and valuers, show that inner London is the
only English region where rateable values will fall (by 40 per cent on
average). Elsewhere rises vary from 34 per cent in the West Midlands and 32
per cent in the north-west to 5 per cent in outer London and 2 per cent in
the south-east.
Mr Cassidy said the transitional relief scheme could provide a strong
incentive to build new office blocks, as buildings completed after April
next year would immediately take on the new rateable values. Neighbouring
properties still contributing to the scheme might have double the rates
bill.
All rateable values, compiled by the Valuation Office, a government agency,
will be available from local authorities from January 3. However, the
authorities do not have to inform businesses of their total bills until
March.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Halifax's 20% cut renews fear of home insurance price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax, the UK's biggest building society, yesterday intensified already
fierce price competition in the household insurance sector by announcing
cuts averaging 20 per cent for building cover from next year.
The move threatens to accelerate falls in household insurance premiums and
reduce the profitability of the UK's main insurers.
Shares in Sun Alliance, which provides about 75 per cent of the household
insurance policies Halifax sells, ended 13p lower last night at 300p. Royal
Insurance, another large household insurer, saw its shares fall 9p to 279p.
Halifax's decision may also increase competition among building societies
which have traditionally profited from high commissions on insurance
policies sold with mortgages. Next year, new rules are expected to allow
building societies to offer their own insurance products.
By refining risk assessment methods, Halifax says some building insurance
rates may drop by up to 60 per cent.
Sun Alliance, which appears to have been forced by Halifax into accepting
the price cuts, said the falls were in line with market trends and only
affected about a third of its Halifax business.
The group is estimated to have achieved a profit margin of about 30 per cent
on its Halifax building insurance business - thanks largely to fewer claims.
Other insurance companies said Halifax was cutting rates from a high level.
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line, the telephone-based insurer,
said: 'We remain lower in price on all examples they give . . . This move is
a desperate attempt by the Halifax to slow the flood of insurance customers
abandoning the building societies.'
But the fear in the insurance sector is that Halifax's premium cuts will
trigger cuts for other insurance products. 'Our fear must be that
differentials will be maintained and that it is not just this line of
business that will be under pressure,' said Mr John Chester, analyst at SG
Warburg.
Halifax said its move reflected competitive pressures, though there was no
'massive haemorrhaging' of its building insurance book. In total, the
society has 1.4m household insurance policies.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Berlusconi urges early election as coalition crumbles:
Italian government on brink of collapse after four Northern League ministers
quit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's eight-month rightwing coalition crumbled yesterday with the
resignation of four ministers from the Northern League and a call by Mr
Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, for early elections.
Mr Berlusconi accepted the imminent fall of his government in a
parliamentary speech, claiming the League defection from the coalition was
'a fraud perpetrated on the electorate' by Mr Umberto Bossi, its leader.
The resignations coincided with the beginning of a turbulent parliamentary
debate on three no-confidence motions tabled by the League and the main
opposition parties. The debate is expected to end tomorrow, unless Mr
Berlusconi decides to cut proceedings short and resign today before a vote
is taken. This was seen as increasingly likely last night.
In a bitter personal attack on Mr Bossi, the prime minister said that if the
government lost its majority in parliament there was 'no option but to seek
the opinion of the electorate'.
The call for early elections was echoed by Mr Berlusconi's faithful allies
in the coalition - the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco
Fini and the small Christian Democratic Centre.
This contrasted sharply with the view of Mr Bossi as well as opposition
leaders who insisted the present situation was too unstable to permit early
elections. They said elections could not be held before changes in electoral
rules, and clear guidelines were established for the control and use of the
media.
A similar view is also shared by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who has the
constitutional authority to dissolve parliament or to ask for the formation
of a new government. In recent days, former president Francesco Cossiga has
emerged as a go-between and possible candidate to head an interim government
to pilot Italy towards elections.
The debate began late because of a demand from one deputy for the
proceedings to be transmitted live on television, a request which was
eventually accepted. Mr Berlusconi's half-hour speech consisted almost
exclusively of an attack on Mr Bossi, whom he said was an unreliable partner
from the outset of the coalition.
The media magnate turned politician repeatedly invoked the legitimacy he
derived from the vote accorded him and his Forza Italia movement 'by the
people' in the March elections.
Mr Bossi replied that Mr Berlusconi had lost his legitimacy because he had
failed to govern and deliver on electoral promises while also pulling the
coalition away from the centre towards the right. The League leader was
confident yesterday that he had sufficient support within the League to
ensure his no-confidence motion, backed by the opposition, would topple the
government. The minimum votes necessary for this in the chamber of deputies
is 316.
It should be clear tomorrow whether Mr Berlusconi will accept a vote on the
three no-confidence motions, or seek to outflank them with his own
confidence motion which would have precedence.
The four ministers who resigned yesterday were: Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, the
finance minister; Mr Francesco Speroni, institutional reform; Mr Vito
Gnutti, industry; and Mr Domenico Commino, EU affairs.

FT  22 DEC 94 / Mars to rethink advertising role of Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mars, the privately owned US confectionery and pet foods group, has launched
a review of the bulk of its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) worldwide advertising,
in response to Mr Maurice Saatchi's removal from the board of advertising
group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi last Friday.
Saatchi's Bates Worldwide Advertising network is one of Mars' two leading
agencies. The company's decision to invite other agencies to pitch for the
business placed with Bates - and other Mars business - makes good a threat
by the Mars brothers, John and Forrest, to consider severing ties with
Saatchi if Mr Saatchi was ousted.
Mr John Murray, responsible for worldwide marketing at Mars, said: 'In view
of the management changes at Saatchi, we have decided to examine our
options. It is a good opportunity to review the performance of our
agencies.'
Saatchi is responsible for about Dollars 400m of Mars' worldwide
advertising, worth some Pounds 30m in annual revenue to the advertising
group. Bates subsidiary is Mars' lead agency for three of its most
successful brands, each with annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn: M&amp;Ms and
Snickers, the chocolate products, and Pedigree, the dog food.
Mars was one of the first three accounts acquired by Bates after it was set
up in 1940. At the moment, Saatchi shares Mars' business with DMB&amp;B, which
also handles about Dollars 400m of business from the confectionery group,
and Grey Advertising.
Grey's Mars business is also understood to be at risk, though the private
confectionery group's relationship with DMB&amp;B is thought to be secure.
Mr Murray said several other advertising agencies would be invited to make
pitches and that the selection process was likely to take several months.
The Mars brothers wrote to Mr Saatchi earlier this year, stressing the
importance of their relationship with him. The letter says: 'It seems
appropriate to remind you, and the management of Bates/Saatchi, that we
insist that our agencies have their top people involved in our business.
This has taken several years to get correct and the present relationship
with you specifically has become significant.'
Mr Saatchi is credited within the advertising group he founded for recently
persuading Mars to give Bates the European account for Maltesers.
However, he infuriated many colleagues during last week's tumultuous
boardroom events by asking the Mars brothers to reiterate their threat to
move their account, in an attempt to persuade the Saatchi board of the
possible commercial damage to the group were he to be ousted.
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has recently helped Mars create its first interactive
computer game advertising campaign. Early next year, computer games
publisher Konami will launch 'Biker Mice from Mars', a game which involves
characters eating Snickers bars for the power to defeat the evil Dr
Limburger.

Interest rates will need to rise in most countries in the industrialised
world over the next few years, as economic growth spreads, the OECD said
yesterday.
However, rates are unlikely to rise as high as they have in previous
economic upturns, and inflation across most of the OECD area is likely to
remain subdued, the OECD said in its latest half yearly outlook.
But the Paris-based body issued a note of warning about the US economy. In
spite of the recent rise in US interest rates it remained unclear whether
this monetary tightening so far was sufficient to prevent inflationary
pressures from souring the recovery, the OECD said.
With growth now spreading to all regions of the industrialised world, the
OECD revised upwards its forecast for the expansion in gross domestic
product for the second time this year.
The 25 OECD economies are now expected to grow on average by 2.8 per cent
this year, and by 3 per cent next year. The OECD's last half-yearly report
forecast growth of only 2.6 per cent this year.
The US remains at the forefront of this surge, though expansion should slow
sharply in the next two years.
However, Canada and the UK are forecast to see the second highest rate of
growth of the seven largest OECD countries next year, with GDP expected to
expand by 4.2 and 3.4 per cent respectively.
Continental Europe is also expected to see accelerating rates of growth next
year, although the growth rate in Germany is not expected to rise above 3
per cent until 1996.
Meanwhile, Ireland is expected to see the fastest growth of any OECD
country, with 5 per cent growth forecast this year and next.
Inflation is expected to remain well below the growth rate in most regions.
Excluding Turkey, which has an unusually high inflation rate, average annual
inflation in the OECD countries is expected to be only 2.3 per cent next
year. But in spite of this optimistic outlook, the OECD warns that
accelerating growth means that governments must soon raise interest rates in
most countries.
The most challenging situation currently exists in the US, where strong
growth over the last four years is estimated to have eroded all the spare
capacity.
Although the US government has already raised interest rates, the report
notes that it 'remains unclear' whether they have been sufficient to prevent
the economy from overheating in the coming years and sliding back into
recession.
The OECD forecasts that short-term interest rates in the US will rise to 6.7
per cent by the start of 1996, and 6.9 per cent in 1996. Although this
implies that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy quite rapidly next
year, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, chief economist at the OECD, yesterday pointed
out that this rise was still likely to leave rates well below their peaks in
previous upturns.
In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the OECD argues that steady recent
growth has created a 'case for continuing with gradual monetary tightening'.
In continental Europe, German interest rates are expected to remain
unchanged in the near future, although the OECD forecasts that short-term
interest rates will rise to 5.6 per cent in 1996.
In Ireland, the Nordic countries and some other European countries interest
rates may also need to be raised soon if conditions deteriorate, the report
says.
The only exception to this upward trend in interest rates is Japan.
Although the OECD predicts that domestic demand will grow faster in Japan
than most other regions in the next year, the 'appropriate time for moving
rates to an upward path appears to be some way off', it says.
One country where short-term interest rates are expected to remain
particularly high over the next two years, however, is Italy. As a result of
the country's soaring budget deficit, rates are expected to rise to 11.8 per
cent next year.
'In the absence of further measures to cut the deficit, the process of
further interest rate convergence with partner countries in Europe is likely
to remain slow,' the OECD said.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Americas free trade area easier said than
done
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Following the bold intentions for a Free Trade Area of the Americas agreed
at the Summit of the Americas, governments in the hemisphere are now facing
up to the practical difficulties of creating such an integrated trade area
by 2005.
Most central and south American governments believe they must either
integrate, or be left behind. But wide disparities in regional economies
mean some are better prepared than others. 'The countries of the hemisphere
are ready to be part of the wider free trade area,' says Mr Ricardo
Hausmann, chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank. 'The
region's economies have stabilised and there is fiscal discipline. The
economies are growing at an average of 3.5 per cent for the past four years,
and investment levels are rising.'
Trade in the Americas grew by 5 per cent per year between 1990 and 1994
despite a global recession, Mr Hausmann said. Countries in the region are
trading more among themselves, and reached a value of Dollars 28bn last year
from Dollars 15.7bn in 1990. 'This will exceed South American trade with the
US this year because policies which previously discouraged trade are now
encouraging it. These policies include trade liberalisation and the
integration of markets.'
Behind these generalities, however, are many disparities between the
region's economies. There is already a concern that, even with extensive
changes in domestic economic policies, the smaller countries could suffer
severe dislocation in the adjustments they will have to make, before they
begin gain from increased trade flows.
'We agree that there is a need for economic liberalisation, and that the
rising tide of economic improvement will lift all the boats,' said Mr Byron
Blake, assistant secretary general of the Caribbean Community. 'But some
small boats which are not well balanced will be capsized. This is the danger
which faces many small economies in the hemisphere.'
One problem is how to integrate - through linking existing trade blocs or
via bilateral negotiations, said Mr Cesar Gaviria, secretary general of the
Organisation of American States and a former president of Colombia.
'The changes which have taken place in the Americas in recent years mean
that the pieces of the puzzle of a hemispheric free trade area are in
place,' he says. 'But as in any assembly line, the pieces have to be put
together to work properly. We cannot over-exaggerate the difficulties,' Mr
Gaviria said.
Stitching together the hemisphere's several trading groups is unlikely to
produce the seamless whole promised by leaders at the Miami summit two weeks
ago. The regional trade blocs are at different stages of development. The
Andean Pact countries, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela, for
example, need to update their trading structure, says Mr Daniel Mazuera,
Colombia's foreign trade minister.
Mr Gaviria argues that some countries will need time to implement trade
liberalisation policies, while the laggards must be given help so they can
catch up.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Russia holds back from Grozny strike: Army meets stiff
resistance in Chechnya but seizes villages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian army yesterday continued to pound Chechen positions to the north
of the capital of Grozny but was meeting what the Russian interior ministry
admitted was 'stiff resistance' and was holding back from an assault.
Although protests at home and abroad are mounting, the Russian government
continues to show a will to squeeze the breakaway republic's capital, if not
yet to take it.
A meeting of ministers, presidential aides and senior parliamentarians
chaired by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, promised further
'decisive action' and noted that the army had come closer to Grozny from the
north-east and north-west and was preparing to cut the minor roads to the
south.
A statement released after the meeting spoke of Chechen forces retreating to
the hills, while those which remained used civilians as 'human shields'. The
government information service built on these reports by maintaining that
the 'city is in panic'.
The reports are not wholly confirmed by journalists who remain in the
Chechen capital. Reuters' reports say that a 'human chain' of many thousands
of residents of Grozny and the surrounding villages stretched along the
highway to the west in an attempt to end hostilities, while the hospitals
continued to function and bread and other supplies were being sold in the
market.
But the overwhelming superiority of Russian armour, now being reinforced by
marines and other troops, is beginning to tell. While a Russian helicopter
was reported shot down by Chechen fire yesterday, the Russian troops claimed
that two villages - Pravoberezhnaya and Chervlyonnaya, to the north - were
taken in heavy fighting.
Western military analysts in Moscow believe the seizure of Grozny is being
delayed until it is emptied and until the surrounding forces have been
weakened. While talks were still being urged yesterday - notably by the
Chechen Mufti, Mukhammad-Hussein Alsabekov, who was speaking in Moscow -
these are now thought all but impossible.
If there is an inhibiting factor on Russia's actions, it is more likely to
come from outside its border than from within. The parliament of Ukraine,
the largest and most important of the former Soviet states neighbouring
Russia, yesterday appealed to Moscow's leaders to stop the fighting, saying
'we call on you to do everything possible so that international human rights
standards and freedoms are applied to the peoples of the Caucasus'.
Only Moslem states - such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Jordan - have
protested over the intervention. They were warned off yesterday by a brusque
statement from the Russian foreign ministry, which said such calls were an
interference in Russia's internal policies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Herve de Charette, France's housing minister, yesterday warned Mr Jacques
Chirac, mayor of Paris and presidential candidate, that his call for
compulsory requisitioning of vacant houses and flats for the capital's
homeless would deter property investment. Instead he proposed to Prime
Minister Edouard Balladur that the government pay special premiums to get
landlords to let vacant properties and to housing associations to help the
poor with rent. To dramatise the plight of the homeless at Christmas, the
venerable Abbe Pierre, long-time champion of France's homeless, last weekend
led a squat of a company-owned property in a smart Paris district, a move
promptly exploited by Mr Chirac and his presidential rival, Mr Balladur.

FT  21 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Extended play for Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pharmaceuticals leader Glaxo forged ahead 23 to 662 1/2 p as good news on
its key drug prompted a rush of buying which sent the shares up to their
highest level since they were routed back in March. Turnover of 19m shares
was at the upper end of the stock's historic daily activity.
Zantac, the anti-ulcer treatment which represents around half of the
company's turnover, was due to lose its principal US patent at the end of
next year. But changes in international patent law as a result of the latest
Gatt agreement mean the patent has been extended until mid-1997.
Zantac has annual sales in the US of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and
one analyst calculated yesterday that extension of the patent could save up
to Pounds 900m over the 18-month period. However, the bears were not
prepared to change their views, arguing that the news did not fundamentally
alter the doubts hanging over the company.
The long-awaited bid for Portals, the specialist paper group, by bank note
printer De La Rue finally hit the screens yesterday and sent the shares of
the two companies in different directions.
For Portals the agreed bid, which represented a paper and cash offer worth
about 1035p a share at yesterday's close, it meant the end of more than 280
years of independence but a good deal for shareholders, whose investments
were worth only 760p a share three weeks ago.
For De La Rue the offer, carrying a cash equivalent of 1011p, was seen to be
stretching the bank balance particularly as, according to some analysts, it
went against earlier assurances that there would be no dilution of earnings.
Ms Sonia Falaschi of UBS commented: 'It is a pretty full price, but
strategically it is the right thing to do.' Portals rose 60 to 1025p, while
De La Rue tumbled 34 to 922p.
Recently floated TeleWest Communications dipped 1 1/2 to 179 1/2 p following
pressure from delayed trades which pushed turnover to 9.2m.
A number of securities houses are known to be bearish on the stock, Robert
Fleming Securities adding to the gloom yesterday with a sell note that drew
attention to the December 30 deadline for the close of TeleWest's
stabilisation period.
The shares are 2 1/2 p short of their issue price. Much of the selling was
said to be coming from Wall Street, where telecoms shares remain out of
favour.
In contrast, BT added 4 at 379p on 6.7m turnover and Cable and Wireless
improved 4 1/2 to 373p for a two-day advance of 11 1/2 . Talk of a possible
hive-off within C&amp;W continued to circulate. Vodafone moved up 5 1/2 to 206
1/2 p on 7.2m traded.
Dealers in the regional electricity stocks chose yesterday to take profits
on several stocks following the recent run. Bid target Northern Electric was
among those that retreated on the profit-taking, losing 16 at 1002p.
Seeboard registered one of the biggest falls in the sector, ending 22 off at
455p.
News that electricity generator PowerGen has agreed to buy between 6.5 and 8
per cent of its own shares when the government sells its 40 per cent stake
in the group next February saw the stock up 7 to 521p.
Wellcome rose 18 to 696p as some dealers suggested that US group Warner
Lambert was interested in making a bid for the pharmaceuticals group.
Wellcome has been seen as 'biddable' for some time and there was heavy
activity in traded options.
ICI improved 7 to 762p as Goldman Sachs raised its 1994 profits forecast to
Pounds 515m from Pounds 500m and the figure for 1995 to Pounds 750m from
Pounds 710m.
Positive press comment boosted drinks group Cadbury-Schweppes by 6 1/2 to
414p.
Views in the market on Trafalgar House, which is currently bidding for
Northern Electric, were polarised after Smith New Court upgraded its
recommendation from a hold to a buy, while NatWest Securities advised
shareholders to reduce their holdings. The shares added a penny at 74p.
Suggestions that the UK hotel market was continuing to improve saw hotels
group Forte harden 4 to 241p. The same market was said to be improving
overseas and dealers turned their attention to Ladbroke, which operates
Continental hotels and several in Japan. The shares moved forward 3 to 163p.
Hopes of improved spending over the Christmas season boosted stocks in the
stores sector. One of the biggest rises was seen in Kingfisher, 10 higher at
439p.
However, Goldman Sachs remained cautious on the sector, and Mr Rod
Whitehead, stores analyst at the US investment bank, believes many companies
are likely to come out with disappointing trading statements next month. He
said: 'Companies are unlikely to make up the ground lost in October and
November.
Elsewhere among stores, House of Fraser relinquished 4 at 176p, after a
block of 5.1m shares was crossed at 175p, well below the market price.
Vickers was easier at 178 1/2 p in spite of the way most analysts found
clear favour with the engines collaboration deal between the group's
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars subsidiary and BMW, of Germany.
With 2.5m shares changing hands at 173p apiece as part of a big programme
trade, aerospace group Rolls-Royce saw turnover climb to 11m. The shares
closed flat at 172p.
Taylor Woodrow moved ahead 6 to 130p after a further round in the company's
share buy-back programme which mopped up 785,300 shares on Monday.
A housebuilding update by NatWest Securities promotes Taylor Woodrow as the
stock with the least downside in the sector.
Heating and air conditioning hire specialist Andrews Sykes jumped 21 to
158p, triggering a statement from the company that it knew of no reason for
the share price movement. Brandon Hire appreciated 7 to 92 1/2 p.
Perceived bid candidates in the banking sector of the market shot forward,
with Smith New Court jumping 16 to 444p and Kleinwort Benson 13 to 548p.
Media conglomerate Pearson fell 9 1/2 to 557 1/2 p on a spate of small
negative stories and a line of more than half a million shares dealt at 558
1/2 p. Some analysts have been shaving forecasts after meeting with the
company.
Composite insurers were victims of their recent strong performance.
Commercial Union, which has outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share Index by 8
per cent over the past three months, fell 10 to 524p as one investor decided
enough was enough and lightened holdings.

FT  21 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures moved ahead strongly for the third session in a row, but
trading volume was less than half of Monday's depressed levels, writes
Jeffrey Brown.
At the close of pit trading the FT-SE 100 March contract was at 3,085, up 23
for a three-day advance of 92 points. The premium to the cash market was 26
points, or three points above fair value.
Activity was neglible, however. Many traders have already closed their books
for the year and those that continue to sit by the telephone report a dismal
lack of business.
The March contract traded at a substantial premium to the cash market all
day, occasionally moving out to a premium of 35 points. But even under these
conditions arbitrage business was modest at best.
Just 3,999 lots had been traded by the official 4.10pm close, down from
9,216 on Monday and in contrast to the 15,000 at which most dealers reckon
that the market starts to pay its way. In these conditions the strong gains
achieved by the March contract are impossible to interpret, said traders.
Option volume remained dull, 29,443 contracts comparing with 26,292 on
Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for 10,600 lots. Drugs group
Wellcome was the most active stock option, clocking up 3,658 lots.

FT  21 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover talk helps drive Footsie
towards 3,100 - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Takeover stories, actual and rumour-based, continued to dominate the UK
equity market yesterday with news of De La Rue's Pounds 682m bid for
Portals, and the prospect of many more bids and mergers in coming months,
overriding the market's fundamental concerns over the short term prospects
for domestic and international interest rates.
As the London market closed, no hard news had emerged from the Federal Open
Market Committee's meeting held to discuss monetary policy, although Wall
Street was under renewed pressure for much of the afternoon and down over 20
points an hour after London closing.
The feeling remained in both Europe and the US that the Federal Reserve
would want to examine all the economic evidence from the fourth quarter
before it moved to increase its interest rates so soon after the last move.
That took place in mid-November when the Fed increased its Fed Funds rate by
75 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent.
On top of the previous session's 16-point fall, dealers said the latest
weakness had produced some tremors around UK dealing desks during the last
two hours of trading.
But the general consensus among traders was that London would probably wind
down for the Christmas holiday in good form, given no shift in US interest
rates.
Helping to sustain all European equity and bond markets was more good news
on inflation and money supply from Germany. Germany's M3 money supply grew
by an annualised 6 per cent in the year to end-November, much better than
the consensus forecast of 6.3 per cent and the annualised 6.9 per cent for
the year to end-October. Inflation figures for November from Bavaria were
also seen as bullish for markets.
'The German numbers were very good for the markets, well within target
ranges,' said the head trader at one of the leading European banks in
London. He added that London's equity market would take heart from any
strength in Euro bourses, especially Frankfurt.
The Bundesbank Council meets in Frankfurt tomorrow to decide the course of
German interest rates.
By the close of trading the FT-SE 100 index had risen a further 23.7 to
3,058.1, its highest level since the end of November and a rise of 114.7, or
3.9 per cent since December 12 when the market was reeling from a
combination of political and economic worries.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was left behind by its senior index, closing only
3.7 higher at 3,463.7.
Earlier, the market had begunon a quiet note, mindful of the overnight fall
on Wall Street. Down 3.9 at the outset the FT-SE 100 index quickly rallied
as news of the De La Rue bid for Portals - at a much higher than expected
price - and other potential bids hit the market. Helping the market move
ahead was a Pounds 30m-plus programme trade which was said to have been
weighted on the buy side and executed by UBS.
Turnover, boosted by the UBS programme trade, increased to a highly
respectable 798.4m shares, with non-Footsie stocks providing almost 66 per
cent of that figure. Customer business on Monday was worth Pounds 1.275bn.
De La Rue, although feeding the market's takeover appetite with its agreed
offer for Portals, suffered from the view that the company was paying a full
price for the paper manufacturer.
The merchant banks and securities houses attracted yet another wave of
strong buying interest as speculators continued to bet on a series of
rationalisation moves in the UK securities business.
Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court, both highly-rated and sizeable players
in London markets, moved near their highest levels since February, when bond
and equity markets began their interest rate driven descent.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico rallies 1.9%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stocks finished a net 1.93 per cent higher after one of the busiest sessions
of the year following a shock government adjustment of the new peso's
trading band with the dollar, allowing a devaluation of up to 13 per cent.
At one stage the market had gained 7.5 per cent, but moved back towards the
close as investors juggled portfolios, mainly moving out of stocks with
heavy dollar-debt burdens and light dollar incomes. The IPC index was
finally 43.06 up at 2,274.17. Volume was 153.8m shares worth 1.9bn new
pesos.
The government explained that it had agreed to devalue the peso against the
dollar in response to the pressure that had been caused to the country's
financial markets as a result of instability in the southern state of
Chiapas.
Officials added that Mexico would be able to meet its economic goals in
1995, and that the devaluation would be re-evaluated within the next six
months.
Sarah Lavers, head of research at LatInvest in London, commented that the
announcement was basically good news. It would make the country more
competitive, and remove uncertainty, although there would be a cost in terms
of the government's own credibility.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow easier following FOMC
news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US equities fluctuated in negative territory yesterday, showing little
reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates at
its open market committee meeting, writes Lisa Bransten in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 23.55 lower at 3,767.15.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.59 at 457.32 and the
American Stock Exchange composite eased 0.43 to 425.30, but the Nasdaq
composite improved 0.62 to 728.51. New York SE volume was a substantial 327m
shares.
The Dow moved up near to Monday's closing level just after a spokesman for
the Federal Reserve said the meeting had adjourned with no announcement, but
proved unable to sustain that level.
Few on Wall Street expected another interest rate increase, but the market
was jittery all morning as investors waited for some official word. There
was some speculation that the Fed might raise rates as much as 50 basis
points. So far this year, the Fed has tightened six times, bringing the rate
to 5 1/2 per cent, from 3 per cent in January.
Reaction was muted to news that the trade deficit for October widened to
Dollars 10.14bn from a revised September figure of Dollars 9.35bn. Although
the trade deficit continues to grow, the October figure was generally in
line with economists' forecasts.
Several important announcements in the high technology sector moved share
prices yesterday. Microsoft, which trades on the Nasdaq, dropped Dollars 3
5/8 to Dollars 59 after the software maker announced that a new computer
operating system may not be available until August of next year.
Intel advanced Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 61 1/4 after the company said it
would replace Pentium chips on demand. Intel shares had been under pressure
in the wake of growing publicity surrounding a flaw in the chip.
Also benefiting from Intel's announcement were computer makers Gateway 2000
and Dell Computer, which are among the primary users of the Pentium chip.
Just after Intel's announcement, Gateway said it would broaden the lifetime
warranty on all of its Pentium-based computers. Its shares were unchanged at
Dollars 22 1/2. Dell was up Dollars 1 at Dollars 38 3/4.
Other technology shares were mixed. Hewlett-Packard rose Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 97 3/8 , while IBM shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 70 3/4 and Apple
Computer dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 38 1/2.
Monsanto fell Dollars 4 to Dollars 68 7/8 after the chemical company agreed
to buy a specialty chemicals business from Merck. An analyst at PaineWebber,
the broking house, downgraded the company, saying the agreement created the
impression that Monsanto was not focusing on cutting costs. Merck put on
Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 38 5/8.
American Depository Receipts of Glaxo Holdings gained Dollars 3/4 at Dollars
20 1/2 after the drugs maker announced that it believed recent Gatt-related
changes to US law would allow for the extension of the patent on its ulcer
drug Zantac in the US. The announcement pushed up Bristol-Myers Squibb,
which also faces uncertainty regarding a patent expiration. The stock rose
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 59 1/2.
Telmex lost nearly 5 per cent after the Mexican government announced that it
was widening the band in which the peso trades against the dollar. ADRs of
the Mexican telephone monopoly fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 46 1/8.
Canada
Golds led a firmer trend in Toronto which lifted the TSE 300 composite index
17.38 to 4,154.13, in spite of continued weakness in New York.
Rising issues outpaced declines by 441 to 374 after volume of 72.3m shares.
Eleven of the 14 sub-indices gained ground, led by communication, gold, real
estate and paper stocks. The metal, oil and pipelines sectors posted
declines. The golds group added 1.42 per cent as the New York spot bullion
price gained USDollars 2.50 at USDollars 382.25 an ounce.

South African stocks ended broadly firmer as a strong gold price and a
recent improvement in steadiness in world equity markets supported trade.
The overall index rose 50.4 to 5,747.3, industrials 25.9 to 6,883.4 and
golds 37.1 to 1,900.8.
Among the leading stocks, De Beers slipped 25 cents to R93, Dries 75 cents
to R57.25 and Anglos R9 to R235. Sasol was 75 cents better at R32.75 and
Nedcor up R1 at R42.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Politics a mixed blessing in
Milan and Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Politics was a mixed blessing for bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff. It kept Milan volatile, currently on the upside, and yet another
strategist, Mr Jerry Evans at Kleinwort Benson, said that political concerns
were overdone and that Italian equities offered solid value. But political
developments continued to depress Madrid.
MILAN continued to forge ahead with the weak lira, at an all-time low
against the D-Mark, offering an apparent bonus to foreign investors. The
Comit index rose 5.65 to 612.91.
Analysts commented that the market was looking beyond the political chaos
surrounding Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government, and hoping that it would soon
be replaced by a caretaker institutional administration, with a prime
minister selected from outside the political parties.
Blue chips were broadly higher. Fiat which set the pace early in the day
finished L54 higher at L5,849, off a high of L5,885.
Telecom Italia, under pressure recently over the concessions that it pays to
the government on its mobile telephones, rebounded L120 or 3.0 per cent to
L4,095.
Credito Italiano picked up L16 to L1,660, with no takers seen for its
Credito Romagnolo bid, but a fresh offer still not ruled out. Rolo finished
L66 down at L18,850.
MADRID, already depressed about the political future of its prime minister,
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, dropped again after Monday's detention of a former state
security chief in connection with anti-Eta undercover operations in the
1980s.
The general index fell 2.91 to 293.46. Banesto dropped another Pta27 to
Pta929 after an intraday low of Pta904 as its former chairman, Mr Mario
Conde, resumed his high court testimony related to criminal charges filed
last week.
FRANKFURT recovered some of Monday's post bourse losses in the morning, but
it could go no further in the afternoon as the Ibis indicated Dax ended at
2,080.16, up 13.57 after a session close of 2,079.93.
Turnover fell from DM5.2bn to DM4.5bn. Dealers said that the market was
waiting to hear the result of yesterday's FOMC meeting in Washington,
although the Fed was not actually expected to act on US interest rates this
week.
There were contrasts in automotive stocks. BMW continued to rise, although
analysts had said that its supply contract with Rolls Royce was a boost to
sentiment, rather than BMW profits on any scale; the shares closed the
afternoon another DM12 ahead at DM766; but Continental fell DM3.10 to DM218
after strength last week on a progress report from the tyremaker.
PARIS moved in a narrow range as investors remained quiet ahead of events in
the US. The CAC-40 index drifted down 3.37 to 1,924.72.
Kleinwort Benson's French equity team remained neutral on the market, noting
that in spite of a modest return of overseas institutions recently, upside
was limited in the absence of the domestic investor and support from the
bond market.
In addition, the broker said, sentiment remained pressured by the
overhanging privatisation programme, as well as political uncertainty ahead
of April's presidential election.
Danone rose FFr4 to FFr777, as the foods group took a controlling stake in
Russia's biggest biscuit manufacturer. The acquisition fits in with the
company's efforts to establish operations in emerging markets; it recently
announced that it had taken a 50 per cent stake in an Argentine biscuit
producer.
ZURICH was higher in low volume, supported by gains in Roche and UBS, and
the SMI index rose 14.0 to 2,614.7.
UBS bearers gained SFr18 to SFr1,078, with the bank again said to be a buyer
of the stock.
Roche certificates rose SFr55 to SFr6,190 and BBC was SFr13 higher at
SFr1,120 amid indications that some foreign investors were raising their
holdings of dollar sensitive stocks.
Ascom was SFr50 ahead at SFr1,350 in further response to the weekend news
that the group had a new chief executive. Hero, the food group, saw its
bearers up SFr13 to SFr658 and the registered SFr5 higher to SFr175,
extending Monday's sharp gain on rumours that it was to be acquired by Del
Monte for an estimated SFr1bn.
AMSTERDAM barely moved, the AEX index retreating 0.21 to 410.64.
Hoogovens outperformed, up Fl 1.40 to Fl 75.80; brokers said that it was
supported by local investors. KPN, rising 70 cents to Fl 58.60, got similar
treatment ahead of its expected listing as a constituent of the blue chip
index.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Germany suffers drop in November bourse
turnover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany suffered a steep drop in bourse turnover in November, 17.9 per cent
after a 1.9 per cent decline in October, and 22.4 per cent down from the
average of the previous three months. Share prices fell 1.7 per cent on the
month, notes Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, which produces the
figures. On the poltical scene there were worries about the narrowness of
Chancellor Kohl's majority; and international interest dropped particularly
sharply, with turnover on Seaq International, London's screen-based system
for dealing in international stocks, down by 28.6 per cent.
Overall, European turnover declined by 3.2 per cent after falls of 3.4 per
cent in October and 3.5 per cent in September. The fall was sustained in
spite of turnover gains in five of the eight markets concerned, and
reflected the weight of Germany in the total. The biggest individual rises
in November came in France, up 10.8 per cent after a drop of 9.1 per cent in
October, and in the UK, with a plus of 9.5 per cent against a previous fall
of 10.3 per cent. France had underperformed for so long, says Mr Cornish,
that investors were beginning to be attracted to its recovery prospects,
while the UK was a cheap market in mid-economic recovery.

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage buying lifts
Nikkei for fifth day in a row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Arbitrage buying pushed share prices higher for the fifth consecutive
trading day, as the rise of the Nikkei index above a technical resistance
level cheered investors, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average rose 136.13 to 19,406.98, having fluctuated between
19,193.64 and 19,417.88. Having lost ground in the morning on profit-taking,
futures purchasing in the afternoon prompted index-linked buying, and the
Nikkei's rise above 19,340, considered by traders as an important resistance
level, prompted short-covering.
Volume was 250m shares, against 254m. 'Most of the trading is still
arbitrage linked, but some foreign investors are buying to cover their short
positions ahead of the year-end,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities.
Institutional investors remained absent ahead of yesterday's FOMC meeting in
the US.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 10.59 to 1,524.90, while
the Nikkei 300 moved up 1.79 to 281.76. Advances led declines by 724 to 265,
with 192 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 0.59 at
1,272.74.
Overseas investors bought financials: Industrial Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank rose Y30 apiece to Y2,830 and Y1,880 respectively. Brokers were
also higher, with Nomura Securities adding Y30 at Y2,030.
Reports of the popularity of new 32-bit electronic games lifted Sony Y50 to
Y5,550. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker which has also recently
introduced its new game hardware, climbed Y110 to Y5,750. But some
high-technology issues lost ground on profit-taking: Fujitsu fell Y7 to
Y970.
Steel issues rallied on bargain hunting, having been sold off by overseas
investors. NKK put on Y5 at Y274 and Nippon Steel Y3 at Y362.
Sakai Ovex, a synthetic fabrics manufacturer, lost Y6 at Y657 after
fluctuating in speculative trading.
Privatisation stocks were higher, with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone up
Y5,000 to Y844,000. Investors were encouraged by reports that the government
had approved NTT's plan to lift basic subscription charges and directory
assistance rates from February next year.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 118.91 to 21,045.85 in volume of 106.9m
shares.
Roundup
The region was mixed, with many investors awaiting the outcome of
yesterday's US FOMC meeting.
HONG KONG reversed an early 99-point loss but trading was relatively thin
ahead of the US rates decision. The Hang Seng index ended 88.99 ahead at
8,267.33, in turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn, down from Monday's HKDollars
2.8bn.
Brokers said that the late rally was fuelled by buy orders from Europe for
Hang Seng index constituents.
Overall market sentiment remained bearish and activity was subdued as many
foreign fund managers had already closed their books for the year.
Banks were the best performers, with the sub-index rising 2.1 per cent. HSBC
and Hang Seng Bank added HKDollars 1.50 each at HKDollars 83.75 and
HKDollars 57. Bank of East Asia surged HKDollars 1.55 to HKDollars 30.80 on
news that it will disclose its inner reserves.
SEOUL remained worried about liquidity and the composite index dipped 4.63
to 1,023.99, a sixth consecutive decline.
Brokers said that unfounded rumours that the government would soon scrap
cash deposit requirements for institutional investors failed to boost blue
chips before government officials denied that such a step was planned.
Korea Mobile Telecom again went limit down, losing Won10,000 to Won443,000,
and Samsung Electronics fell Won1,900 to Won107,000.
KUALA LUMPUR reversed an easier morning trend to end higher, led by
institutional buying of Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia. The composite
index rose 8.94 to 966.19, although activity was subdued.
Telekom advanced 40 cents to MDollars 17.70 and Tenaga was up 30 cents at
MDollars 10.50.
Pernas International added 38 cents at MDollars 3.62 after its proposed
one-for-two bonus issue was approved by the securities commission.
TAIPEI lost Monday's gains on a bout of heavy profit-taking. The weighted
index fell 1.8 per cent or 130.02 to 6,925.28. Turnover was TDollars 104bn.
The financial sector was the hardest hit, with ICBC falling TDollars 5.50 or
5 per cent to TDollars 104.50 and Chang Hwa Bank down TDollars 10 or 4.8 per
cent to TDollars 198. Textiles were also weak, Chung Shing Textile slipping
40 cents to TDollars 21.40.
Shinkong Synthetic Fibres went against the trend, appreciating TDollars 1.10
or 2.55 per cent to TDollars 44.90.
MANILA saw selective buying of heavily weighted stocks, including PLDT and
San Miguel, which helped to lift the composite index 16.78 to 2,740.04.
Turnover totalled a moderate 2.37bn pesos.
Some brokers commented that many investors were taking positions in blue
chips ahead of dividend declarations in the first two months of 1995.
The commercial-industrial sector led advancing areas, gaining 17.61 at
4,037.17.
SYDNEY was easier as it tracked the overnight performance of Wall Street.
The All Ordinaries index was off 1.4 at 1,898.6 but after an intraday low of
1,890.8. Trading was modest, with shares valued at ADollars 397m changing
hands.
Mining stocks were generally higher, however, with the exception of CRA, 2
cents softer at ADollars 17.82.
Banks were mixed, with NAB retreating 14 cents to ADollars 10.30, mainly on
options-linked deals, as Westpac rose 5 cents to ADollars 4.33 and CBA 4
cents to ADollars 8.17.
BANGKOK picked up just before the close on late speculative buying in the
finance sector. The SET index improved 14.90 to 1,352.68 in moderate
turnover of Bt4.7bn.
The finance sector rose 2.6 per cent, with Phatra Thanakit firming Bt7 to
Bt199.
KARACHI plunged to a year's low on continuing worries about trouble and
violence in the city. The KSE 100-share index shed 61.41 or 3 per cent to
1,937.13. Declining issues led advances by 220 to 45.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar steady as FOMC leaves rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday showed little response to the decision by the Federal
Open Market Committee to leave US interest rates unchanged, writes Philip
Gawith.
The decision had been expected, but the chance of a surprise monetary
tightening had left traders cautious ahead of the meeting.
The US currency closed in London at DM1.5720, from DM1.5738, and at Y100.13
from Y100.155. Soon after the meeting finished, around 19.15 GMT, the dollar
was trading at DM1.57. It ended in New York at DM1.5701 and Y100.17.
The main excitement came from Mexico, where the government sanctioned a 15
per cent devaluation of the peso. The upper limit of the peso's trading band
against the dollar was raised by 53 centavos.
The daily rate at which the peso is permitted to slide against the dollar,
equivalent to 4.3 per cent in a year, was maintained after the devaluation.
The peso finished in London at 3.885 against the dollar, 12 per cent down
from Monday's close of 3.4647.
In Europe the lira remained the main focus, ahead of the no confidence vote
later this week. It touched a record low of L1,049.80 against the D-Mark,
but the market shied away from pushing it through the L1,050 barrier.
Sterling had a quiet day, with the trade-weighted index ending unchanged at
80.3.
The decision to devalue the peso was taken by members of the Pact for
Well-Being, Stability and Growth. They include government, business, labour
and campesino leaders.
The Pact said the decision to allow the peso to slide was taken in response
to rebel threats in the Chiapas region that have recently unsettled Mexican
financial markets.
A growing current account deficit, however, provides an economic explanation
for currency weakness. Before yesterday's move, some observers had
considered the peso overvalued, in spite of having fallen by more than 10
per cent against the dollar during the year.
Mexico's current account deficit is expected to widen to about Dollars 28bn
this year, more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product. With capital
flows insufficient to finance the deficit, reserves have fallen by about
Dollars 10bn since February, and short-term interest rates have risen above
14 per cent, more than 7 per cent in real terms.
Some economists argued that for interest rates to come down and economic
growth to accelerate, above the 3 per cent expected for this year, a
devaluation was necessary.
Until yesterday, the government had been opposed to a devaluation, arguing
that interest rates would still rise, to quell concerns about imported
inflation, while Mexican companies with large foreign currency loans would
suffer heavy losses.
Last week Mr Jaime Serra Puche, finance minister, said the peso would be
defended with higher interest rates, at the expense of 1995 growth targets.
The bellwether interest rate on the 91-day tesobono, a dollar-denominated
money market instrument, rose after the announcement by 88 basis points to
8.28 per cent.
The Pact said, however, that Mexico would be able to meet its economic goals
in 1995, particularly that of price stability, supply and economic growth.
The dollar showed little response to the release of October trade figures,
in spite of a widening in the bilateral deficit with Japan.
Ahead of the FOMC meeting, analysts said the dollar had limited downside if
interest rates were kept on hold.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said investors
were expecting the dollar to move higher in 1995. After meeting recently
with a cross-section of the firm's US clients, he said he 'did not come
across anybody who was bearish on the dollar'. His view that the dollar
would reach DM1.65/70 next year, possibly in the first quarter, 'seemed to
be generally accepted'.
Mr MacKinnon added that rising German interest rates - he expects the first
upward move in the first quarter of 1995 - would cap the dollar's progress.
He said it was also his impression that the Bundesbank did not like the
D-Mark slipping through the DM1.70 level against the dollar.
The Bank of England cleared an Pounds 850m money market shortage, mostly
through late assistance.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ apple growers have bumper
year in spite of storms
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New Zealand apple industry overcame severe storm damage and intense
competition from rival producers to earn NZDollars 603m (Pounds 247m) from
its fresh fruit and commercial activities in the year to September 30, one
of the best returns on record.
A year earlier, returns were hit by a global glut of fruit, and profits fell
to NZDollars 571m.
Mr John McCliskie, chairman of the Apple and Pear Board, said that pipfruit
export payments to orchardists averaged NZDollars 16.70 a carton, a 54 per
cent increase on the 1993 year.
The board exported 11.6m cartons of fruit to 60 countries, worth NZDollars
455m.
New Zealand was the first country apart from South Korea to break into the
Japanese market. Other new markets were Northern China, Vietnam, Somalia and
Sri Lanka. Premium prices were obtained in a number of markets including the
UK where prices were 29 per cent higher than the market average.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diamond sales remain at
near-record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sales of rough (uncut) diamonds remain near record levels but the market is
still in turmoil and cutters continue to complain about lack of
profitability. That was the message yesterday from De Beers, the South
African group whose London-based Central Selling Organisation accounts for
at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough diamonds.
The CSO said its sales reached USDollars 4.25bn (Pounds 2.59bn) this year,
2.7 per cent below the record set in 1993 but still the second-highest total
ever achieved.
Nevertheless, the CSO made it clear that all is not well in the market. It
cited:
'Leakages' of high-quality diamonds from government stockpiles in Russia, in
breach of the contract between Russia and the CSO, that are continuing from
time to time and having a depressing effect on sentiment in the cutting
centres. There are also uncertainties because the CSO's contract with the
Russians ends in 1995 and negotiations about a new one have not been going
well.
A build up of stocks at the cutting centres, particularly of small polished
stones from India. The CSO reduced its supply of small stones from the
second quarter of this year but the raw material the Indian cutters need is
plentiful following sales from Russian and US strategic stockpiles. These
diamonds were considered suitable only for industrial use when they were
stockpiled but the subsequent development of the Indian industry, which can
cut small stones economically, means that many of the stockpiled diamonds
are cutable.
The CSO has not increased prices since February, 1993. That increase was of
only 1 1/2 per cent and was the first since 1990. Producers with CSO
contracts have been asked to cut deliveries from previously-agreed levels
and the CSO said yesterday this quota would remain at 85 per cent.
On the other hand, the CSO said sales of diamond jewellery had been
resilient during recent difficult world trading conditions and retail
diamond jewellery sales in 1994 were likely to match last year's record
USDollars 42bn.
It pointed out that supplies of cut diamonds from India had fallen
substantially because of the recent outbreak of pneumonic plague, which
started in Surat, a region that provides more than one third of India's cut
diamonds. Some factories, deserted by frightened, fleeing workers, still had
not reopened. 'Time will take care of the oversupply,' a CSO official
insisted.
Mr Michael Coulson, analyst with Nedcor Securities, suggested that the CSO's
profit margins were being squeezed and he expected De Beers' 'diamond
account' profits for 1994 to be down a little. However, De Beers' net
profits, after other income was taken into account, were likely to be ahead
of those for 1993. He said world diamond sales were likely only to 'inch
ahead' in 1995 and he hoped the CSO would give up its policy of saturating
the market in the first half.
He predicted the Russians would sign a new contract with the CSO but on more
favourable terms.
De Beers also is convinced that Russia will stay in the diamond cartel. It
recalled that Mr Harry Oppenheimer, former chairman of De Beers, said
recently: 'Demand in the world for diamonds is stronger and more firmly
established than it has ever been and co-operation between all the major
producers is beyond doubt in the interests of them all.'

FT  21 DEC 94 / World Commodities Prices: Base metals volatile in thin trade
 -Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Base metals prices swung in both directions at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday, with moderate orders having an exaggerated effect in fairly thin
markets.
Falls in LME stocks gave the markets a steady start but there was no follow
through buying.
Three months delivery COPPER reached Dollars 2,965 a tonne after news of a
4,475 tonnes stocks fall but later fell back to Monday's low of Dollars
2,930 before finding support.
ALUMINIUM found good support on dips but failed to break resistance above
Dollars 1,900 a tonne.
London Commodity Exchange COCOA futures bounced from early lows to end
higher in healthy volume. The most-active March futures contract was up
Pounds 13 on the day at Pounds 989 a tonne and December closed up Pounds 12
at Pounds 1,035.
COFFEE prices ended down but off the day's lows in sluggish trade.
'There has been some price-fixed buying that helped lift the market a bit in
the afternoon. New York also performed better than some people had
expected,' said one trader.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe's flower exports take
to the sky - The country's growers are now the EU's fourth largest suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Danckwerts, a prominent Zimbabwe farming family, decided to grow
flowers for export to northern Europe, they were warned it would be a flop.
Less than 10 years later, they are leaders in a blossoming industry that is
flying out over 7,000 tonnes of cut flowers to brighten the northern winter
each year, bringing the country ZDollars 290m (Pounds 22m) in annual export
earnings.
'This sort of thing is ideal for Zimbabwe,' says Rijk Danckwerts, who farms
1,600 hectares next to Harare airport with his brother Craig.
Using a combination of reliable sunshine, artificial light and black plastic
coverings to force flowering, they can produce 12 flushes from a plant in
one season and fly flowers out every day between October and early June.
'That's important to buyers,' he says.
The flower business, which now accounts for at least half the two farms'
annual turnover of ZDollars 12m, is a truly international one. The varieties
the Danckwerts use are bred in Israel, grown in Zimbabwe and sold directly
to supermarkets such as Sainsbury in the UK, or via the Dutch auctions to
destinations as distant as Japan or Canada. Zimbabwe is now the fourth
largest exporter of flowers to the European Union.
The industry took off when white tobacco farmers decided to diversify,
fearing the strength of the anti-smoking lobby in the west. Low
international prices last year meant a fall in plantings of tobacco,
Zimbabwe's biggest agricultural export, leading to a 22 per cent smaller
harvest this year. Moreover, the World Bank predicts that tobacco prices
will remain close to the 1993 level over the next few years and then fall in
real terms by about 10 per cent over the following decade.
Another reason for moving into flowers was concern about the government's
moves to redistribute white-farmed land to black Zimbabweans to relieve
population pressures and provide homes for those displaced by the war that
led to independence in 1980. Flower production has enabled white farmers to
maintain or increase their incomes by using small areas of land intensively.
The Danckwerts produce their flowers from 9.5 hectares of greenhouses.
As well as the climatic advantage, the industry enjoys very low labour costs
compared with northern hemisphere flower-producing countries. Horticulture
is also one of the few sectors in Zimbabwe that has never been subject to
state marketing controls.
The Danckwerts began by growing summer flowers such as delphiniums, but
moved into higher value roses when the Zimbabwe dollar lost value and
airfreight costs soared. Roses are the most typical Zimbabwean product, but
the brothers switched again, this time into asters, when roses became common
and prices fell.
'We didn't want to follow the trend too closely,' says Rijk Danckwerts,
pointing out that Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe will produce 200m to 300m
more roses between them this year than last. Roses also require
ultra-cautious handling. 'You only have to look at a rose and something goes
wrong.'
By specialising, he is able to boast that the white aster variety produced
by the family company, Sunshine Flowers, is grown nowhere else in the
southern hemisphere. The asters, grown at 35'C, are picked and sorted, then
transferred to cold storage at 4'C. From there, it is only 10 minutes to the
airport, where they are dispatched to Europe.
The industry is not free of troubles. The economic structural adjustment
programme introduced in 1991 has pushed up interest rates to 35 or 40 per
cent. This makes it difficult for new farmers to enter production and for
existing ones to expand, especially given the shift to high-value flowers
requiring hefty capital investment. Nevertheless, a few black farmers are
managing to work their way in.
Airfreight tariffs are among the highest in the world, accounting for 40-65
per cent of the cost, insurance and freight value of the flowers. The
national cargo line, Affretair, enjoys state protection against competition
and the unreliability of its schedules poses serious problems for producers
of short-life commodities.
Despite this, the flower industry, together with the productive fruit and
vegetable sector, is being encouraged by the government because it is highly
labour intensive - employing about 30 people, mostly women, per hectare -
and because of its high returns. Mr Stanley Heri, chief executive of the
Horticulture Promotion Council, points out that horticulture can produce the
same turnover from one hectare as 20 hectares of maize.
Export earnings from horticulture are already the fourth highest among
agricultural products, after tobacco, beef and sugar. 'Horticulture will
overtake tobacco within 10 years,' Mr Heri says confidently.
Given that the west European cut flower market is expected to grow from
Dollars 12.5bn in 1990 to more than Dollars 19bn by 2000, he may well be on
to something.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Attention turns to Italian scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Most European bond markets ended a lethargic session little changed.
Even in Italy, where political problems continued to simmer, prices were
little changed in quiet dealings ahead of crucial confidence votes in
parliament, expected this week. 'This could be the lull before the storm,'
said one dealer.
In a move to steal his opponents' thunder, Italian prime minister Mr Silvio
Berlusconi signalled his intention to seek a parliamentary vote of
confidence in his government expected as early as today.
Although Mr Berlusconi's government already faces motions for three
no-confidence votes, a cabinet spokesman said that under Italy's
constitution a motion for a confidence vote takes precedence over a
no-confidence vote. If Mr Berlusconi loses the vote and resigns, he would
demand immediate elections, the spokesman said.
Many observers said that if the government loses the vote - which is seen as
increasingly likely - the president might set up an interim 'institutional
government' to restore political calm. Ultimately, however, 'another general
election is likely in the spring, irrespective of whether Berlusconi
survives the vote or an institutional government is established,' said Mr
Ken Wattret, international economist at HSBC Markets.
The market shrugged off the final approval by the lower house of Italy's
parliament to the 1995 budget, which now becomes law. The budget, consisting
of three separate items of legislation, aims to reduce next year's deficit
by L48,000bn to L138,600bn.
The March BTP futures contract on Liffe ended at 98.99, down 0.01 point on
the day.
German government bonds ended a lacklustre session little changed in spite
of lower-than-expected money supply data. Annualised M3 growth fell to 6 per
cent - the top of the Bundesbank's target range - in November, from 6.8 per
cent in October.
The market also shrugged off the Bundesbank's announcement of a 10-year bund
issue planned for December 28 and 29 - the government's traditional New Year
bond. Some were disappointed that Bonn was not issuing a 30-year bond. 'The
Finance Ministry said last year that they would issue at least one 30-year
bond each year, but they haven't,' said a Frankfurt dealer, adding: 'The
market needs fresh 30-year supply to keep the long end liquid.' The 10-year
March bund future on Liffe closed at 89.65, down 0.05 point.
UK gilts ended a slow day slightly weaker on thin volume. Prices softened
slightly on strong M4 lending data for November, but dealers reported little
trading activity. 'People are mainly tying up loose ends and closing their
books,' said one trader. However, another dealer reported some demand for
index-linked gilts, which rose by about  1/4 point. The March long gilt
future on Liffe ended at 102 3/16 , down 1/8 point.
US Treasury prices were mixed yesterday after the Federal Reserve's open
market committee ended its last meeting of the year without taking any
action.
Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 5/32 at
95 31/32 yielding 7.845 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up 1/16 at 99 7/16, yielding 7.545 per cent.
As the FOMC meeting began, most analysts discounted the chances of another
interest rate increase. Still, some economists had said they thought the Fed
might boost rates as much as 50 basis points, and the market was skittish
all morning as the committee met in private.
Prices hardly moved after a spokesman for the Fed said the FOMC meeting had
adjourned and there would be no statement.
Since the last FOMC meeting, the yield spread between two-year and 30-year
bonds narrowed as the market became convinced that the Fed's tightening
would restrain the robust economy. Over the past week it widened slightly
after mild inflation figures led investors to bet against a rate increase in
December.
Release of the October trade figures drew only muted reaction. The Commerce
Department reported the trade deficit widened to Dollars 10.1bn from a
revised September figure of Dollars 9.35bn.
In spite of the increase in the trade deficit, the market held steady as the
figure was well within the range of consensus estimates. Also, a steady
dollar helped stabilise the bond market.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Battle looms for North
American gold producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A battle is looming between two North American gold producers,
Vancouver-based Granges and Atlas Corporation, which has its headquarters in
Denver.
Atlas acquired 37.2 per cent of Granges for CDollars 50.7m (USDollars 36.9m)
from MIM, the Australian resources group. Mr Steve Manz, Atlas president,
said recently he had the support of enough other Granges shareholders to
take control of that company's board at the next annual meeting - which must
be held before June next year.
The objective, said Mr Manz, was a full merger of Atlas, Granges and a third
company, Hycroft, in which Granges has a 50 per cent stake. This would
create a group with an annual output in 1996 of at least 150,000 troy ounces
of gold.
Mr John Auston, president of Granges, said these comments suggested that
Atlas was ready to breach a formal agreement signed at the time of the
purchase of the MIM holding.
Atlas agreed that the number of its appointees to the Granges board would be
in proportion to its shareholding. Atlas also agreed not to take its holding
in Granges to more than 40 per cent without making an offer to all Granges
shareholders.
Mr Manz denied there had been any improper soliciting of proxies by Atlas.
'We were approached by Granges shareholders,' he insisted. As for the
standstill agreement, 'we'll let time take care of that,' he declared.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Chase Manhattan sees revenue
dip in fourth quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chase Manhattan, the US bank, said it expected to report substantially lower
trading revenues in the fourth quarter than in the third, but this would be
partly offset by other revenue items, Reuter reports from New York.
Chase also said that other business areas, excluding trading, would report
fourth-quarter revenue trends that would be much the same as in the third
quarter.
Chase's trading revenues were Dollars 188m in the third quarter, Dollars
151m in the second, Dollars 179m in the first quarter, and Dollars 167m in
the 1993 fourth quarter.
Chase previously said it would take a Dollars 20m fourth-quarter
restructuring charge from buying the American Residential mortgage company
and that it would have Dollars 100m in pre-tax costs from a voluntary
retirement programme.
Chase said the Dollars 100m in fourth-quarter expenses would be offset by
other revenue items, such as the previously announced sale of Chase Florida,
resulting in a non-material impact on earnings.
Analysts generally expect the fourth quarter to be a poor one for trading
revenues at most banks because of difficult trading conditions, particularly
in bond markets.
Last week, JP Morgan said it also expected 'substantially reduced' trading
revenues in the fourth quarter from the third quarter's Dollars 282m.
It also said that, mostly as a result of this, fourth-quarter earnings would
be lower than third-quarter earnings.

Finmeccanica, Italy's state-controlled engineering group, has returned to
the international syndicated loan market after an absence of several years.
A Dollars 200m loan for the group, arranged by NatWest Markets, was
increased to Dollars 250m after being oversubscribed in syndication.
The three-year loan was priced at 40 basis points over the London interbank
offered rate, and will refinance a short-term domestic bilateral loan. It is
extendible to five years at a price of 45 basis points over Libor.
Underwriters were Banco di Napoli, NatWest Markets, Nomura International,
and Societe Generale, with 18 other banks in the syndicate.
The National Bank of Egypt took part in a DM130m syndication loan for the
Israeli government, a Bank Leumi spokesman said, Reuter reports from
Jerusalem.
The credit line was organised by Bank Leumi UK and Chemical Bank. This is
the first time in five years that the Israeli government has raised money
abroad through a consortium of banks.

<TEXT>
Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based investment bank owned by institutional
shareholders including Hill Samuel of the UK, said yesterday it would list
on the Australian Stock Exchange by the end of 1996. It added that it was
unlikely to seek significant new capital as part of the process.
Mr David Clarke, chairman, said the listing's main purpose would be 'to
accommodate the desire of the bank's shareholders to see a more liquid
market for the shares'.
The bank, he added, regarded its capital base as 'extremely strong' and , at
this stage, did not plan to raise any significant new capital when it lists.
The bank had indicated it would canvas shareholders about the listing option
in early-1995. However, it said yesterday this process had already been done
in a more informal fashion.
Mr Allan Moss, managing director, said the majority had been in favour, and
were relaxed about the timing 'provided it was ' within a reasonable
period'.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: PowerGen buy-back to ease
stake sale plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confirmation yesterday that PowerGen intends to buy back 8 per cent of its
shares should ease the way for the government's planned disposal of its
stake in the power generators next year.
The news, expected after a similar announcement by National Power last
month, should make the shares more attractive to investors by enhancing
earnings per share.
Another feature of the deals - announced last week - should also increase
the prospects of success by increasing competition among banks appointed to
distribute the stock.
The structure of the distribution syndicate is both smaller - only 17 banks
are involved - and less hierarchical than that deployed so far in
international equity issues.
This 'will ensure the most effective distribution for both international
offers, promoting healthy competition between managers,' said a spokesman
for BZW and Kleinwort Benson, the joint global co-ordinators and
bookrunners.
Alongside these two banks, four international managers - Cazenove, Paribas,
UBS and S. G. Warburg - have been named to run the offering in the UK.
Five banks - Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan, NatWest Markets and
RSC Dominion - will manage the sale in North America, while six other banks
 -Argentaria, Mediobanca, Flemings, Lehman Brothers, Nikko and WestLB - will
manage the sale in the rest of the world.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Bonds: Two borrowers brave subdued conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Christmas slowdown in the eurobond market continued yesterday, with only
two borrowers braving the subdued market conditions with highly structured
deals.
SMM, a special purpose vehicle backed by debt and equity assets, launched a
five-tranche multi-currency offering via J. P. Morgan.
The issue, which included fixed-rate and floating-rate dollar tranches and
sterling, D-Mark and Swiss franc floating-rate tranches, was targeted at
specific investor groups, a syndicate official at J. P. Morgan said.
The offering met with interest from institutional accounts, with a number of
large block purchases in continental Europe, he said.
The main Dollars 719m tranche of two-year floating-rate notes offered a
coupon of 12 1/2 basis points over three-month Libor.
Nippon Credit launched a Dollars 150m issue of five-year credit enhanced
performance bonds for a separate special purpose vehicle. The offering found
demand from institutional investors worldwide, Nippon Credit said.
The Canadian province of Alberta has established a Dollars 1.5bn medium term
note programme, Merrill Lynch, which arranged the deal, said in a statement.
The programme will allow for the distribution of notes into the US, the
euromarkets and the Canadian market. The notes can be denominated in a
variety of currencies with a maturity of up to 15-years, Merrill Lynch said.
In a similar move, Credit Suisse announced a Dollars 1.5bn multi-currency
medium-term note programme.
Elsewhere, the devaluation of the Mexican peso had little impact on spreads
on Mexican eurobonds, analysts said. The effect on confidence was greater in
the more liquid Brady bond market where bond prices fell by about  3/4 point
before recovering slightly.
Unibanco Leasing launched a Dollars 50m issue of three-year FRNs offering
330 basis points over six-month Libor.

ConAgra, the US diversified foods group, said it expects fiscal 1995 to be
its 15th consecutive year of record earnings, Reuter reports from Omaha.
Mr Philip Fletcher, chairman, said: 'We believe it also will be a year in
which ConAgra creates substantial shareholder value for the future.'
Net income for the second quarter ended November 27 was Dollars 0.63 a
share, up from Dollars 0.56 a year ago. In the first half, ConAgra earned
Dollars 0.94 a share, up from Dollars 0.83. 'Our company's first-half
results were excellent, but our actions to drive future results were more
important,' Mr Fletcher said.
He said ConAgra had acquired several businesses that fit tightly with core
operations and add quickly to earnings. It began an accelerated programme to
divest non-core businesses and continued to refresh branded foods, including
Healthy Choice, he added.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bankers Trust warns on profits
for quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust yesterday became the third big New York-based bank in a week
to issue a profits warning, underlining the damage to the revenues of some
banks caused by the weakness in financial markets.
The bank, which relies more heavily than many competitors on income from
trading in financial markets, said earnings in the final three months of
this year were likely to be below the Dollars 169m after-tax profits of the
third quarter.
It blamed the fall on 'persistently difficult market conditions and a
resulting decline in client activity'.
At the same time, the bank said it was raising its quarterly dividend to
Dollars 1 a share from 90 cents, reflecting long-term growth prospects.
In this, Bankers Trust mirrored J. P. Morgan, which also raised its dividend
last week while warning that profits in the final period would not match the
previous three months.
Meanwhile, Bankers Trust has agreed to cancel two foreign currency
derivative contracts sold to a customer in the US. The customer, Federal
Paper, said it was planning to take a Dollars 12m pre-tax gain in the
current quarter following the cancellation of the two contracts.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: The end of a chapter at Jardine
Matheson - The group is delisting from Hong Kong's stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It might have been the stuff of a novel by the late James Clavell. After
Jardine Matheson, the international trading house, provided such a rich
source of material for his pot-boilers on Hong Kong - Taipan and The Noble
House - its delisting from the colony's stock exchange at the end of this
month would surely have been a source of inspiration.
The theme is clear. Jardine's decision to delist because it did not want to
fall under Chinese regulation after the colony's transfer to China in 1997
is seen by many as a mirror image of a broader British decline in Hong Kong.
The company rose to pre-eminence under British rule: now that rule is on the
wane, so too are Jardine's fortunes, according to this view.
The idea the Jardine Matheson group of companies is 'leaving Hong Kong' was
reinforced by the current bid by Trafalgar House, the UK construction and
shipping group, for Northern Electric, the UK power company. Trafalgar is
effectively controlled by Hongkong Land, a Jardine company.
But the notion is hotly contested by Jardine's senior managers. They
maintain 60 per cent of the company's profits derive from Hong Kong and
China. That will remain the case for some time to come.
They employ 56,000 people in Hong Kong and note that Hongkong Land would not
be planning a multi-billion dollar investment in the colony's container port
if Jardine were 'leaving'.
Another, more dominant view in the financial community is that Jardine's
management has taken a 12-gauge shot gun, carefully aimed it at its
collective foot, and pulled the trigger. The company, according to this
view, has frittered away a reservoir of Chinese goodwill towards it, and
unnecessarily handicapped itself for life after 1997. That the Chinese have
put an effective halt to its development of the container port is seen as
evidence of this.
These observers point out that Jardine could have built on the contacts of
Sir John Keswick, the uncle of Henry and Simon who today run the group from
London, who was an intimate friend of Zhou Enlai, China's revered prime
minister under Mao. Instead, since 1984 when Henry and Simon moved the
company's domicile to Bermuda, Jardine has gone out of its way to cock a
snoot at Hong Kong's incoming landlord, the observers say.
It seems not a day passes without some mainland Chinese criticism of the
company in the colony's press. Most recent was the commentary which appeared
in Bauhinia, a monthly magazine published under auspices of the Xinhua news
agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong.
Bauhinia contrasted Jardine's behaviour with that of other British
companies, such as Swire, Hongkong Telecom, Inchcape and Hongkong Bank.
Jardine was portrayed as 'fearful' of 1997 and lacking confidence in Hong
Kong after the transfer.
Mr Alasdair Morrison, Jardine taipan in Hong Kong, says of the bad
atmosphere surrounding the company's relations with China: 'You have to
separate rhetoric from the underlying business reality.
'I was recently told during a visit to Beijing that we were welcome to do
business in China,' he adds.
'Business there has been going well. We have more than 60 joint ventures and
a number of new ones were finalised in the past six months. We are expanding
our trading and services business in China, and Hongkong Land is looking to
invest in property. Our joint ventures in China employ about 10,000 people.'
Turnover, including associates of the group, is about USDollars 1bn.
Of the associates he mentions the most important is Trafalgar House. It is
doing big business on the mainland, but Jardine Matheson only owns a net
4.57 per cent of the company. That said, Jardine, of all the big British
companies based in Hong Kong, is probably doing most in China. It has
interests in motor vehicle distribution, aviation and shipping, trading and
distribution, and engineering and construction.
More than its interests in China, many analysts like the spread of Jardine's
businesses, and, against a background of rising interest rates, the low debt
on its balance sheet. The combination of diversified businesses and low
debt, together with forecast earnings' growth of between 14-15 per cent over
the next few years, leads many to rate Jardine as a good 'defensive play'.
'I put out a 'buy' recommendation a week ago because it is so cheap,' says
Mr John Godfray, conglomerates analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in
Hong Kong. But even Mr Godfray concedes many clients do not want to know
about it. 'It's not an index stock,' he says.
The Jardine group has lost its position in the Hang Seng index of leading
Hong Kong stocks. This month, Jardine Matheson, and three others in the
group, were deleted from the Morgan Stanley Capital International index for
Hong Kong. It will, however, remain a constituent of the Hong Kong index of
the FT-Actuaries World Index.
The Keswicks' attempt to insulate the group from an unwelcome takeover has,
from Morgan Stanley's point of view, made the Jardine group effectively
stateless. It will not be included in any other Morgan Stanley index, not
even the one it calculates for Singapore - the market to where Jardine hopes
its Hong Kong share trading will migrate.
Morgan Stanley says the act of inclusion or exclusion of a stock from one of
its indices has a short-term impact on share price performance, although the
long-term impact is negligible. Jardine hopes so.
The company has spent a considerable sum on informing shareholders of the
end to Hong Kong trading.
This includes footing the HKDollars 2m (USDollars 259,000) cost of
transferring all Hong Kong registered shares to Singapore, to ensure the
market for its shares does in fact migrate to Singapore.
An elaborate, and to the shareholder costless, set of procedures has been
established to ensure shareholders can deal in Jardine stock.
Mr Neil McNamara, Jardine company secretary, says: 'There will be no day
that an investor cannot trade Jardine Matheson or Jardine Strategic shares
because the scrip is in transit.'
But the fact remains that the natural market for Jardine's stock is Hong
Kong. Up to 85 per cent of the worldwide turnover in its shares occurs in
Hong Kong, with the rest in London. Like the Chinese state enterprises
listed in New York, the company might find trading in its shares evaporates
and its share price languishes.
Unlike those companies, however, Jardine can be reasonably confident that
Hong Kong stockbrokers will continue to research the company and its
prospects.
The long-term refuge of its share price lies, therefore, in the efficient
operation of the market; its shareholders have to hope the market, spotting
a mis-priced stock, corrects it.

<TEXT>
Mattel, the US toy manufacturer which outbid Hasbro in a battle for J. W.
Spear of the UK in July, has announced it was cutting 1,000 jobs from its
international workforce of 22,000 in an attempt to reduce costs and increase
profitability.
It said the cuts would produce a pre-tax restructuring charge of about
Dollars 70m in the year just ending.
However, the increase in efficiency would produce pre-tax savings of about
Dollars 25m next year and greater amounts thereafter.
In the year to December 1993, Mattel had net income of Dollars 117m on sales
of Dollars 2.7bn, but reported that the figure would have been Dollars 226m
were it not for the costs of absorbing Fisher-Price, a toy company it took
over at the end of 1993.
Mattel said it expected this year's results from operations to make 1994 the
sixth consecutive year of record sales and earnings. It also announced a
stock split and 25 per cent increase in the quarterly dividend to 6 cents a
share.
Mattel said the restructuring would involve the consolidation of
manufacturing operations and the reduction of headquarters expense and
support functions around the world.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Carpenter, the former chairman of Kidder Peabody who was ousted
from the US investment bank earlier this year, re-emerged yesterday in a
senior position at Travelers, the broad-based financial services group.
The British-born executive will run Travelers' life insurance and annuity
businesses, which the company said would generate premiums this year of more
than Dollars 2bn.
He has also been named an executive vice-president of the group, making him
one of Travelers' most senior executives.
The company said he would work closely with Mr Sanford Weill, who has
assembled the Travelers group through a series of acquisitions, on planning
and strategy issues.
Mr Carpenter had been chairman and chief executive of Kidder for nearly five
years, and had been responsible for attempts to transform the General
Electric subsidiary into a big bond trading house.
Kidder eventually foundered on the discovery of what it claimed was a big
bond trading fraud, and on the collapse in bond markets earlier this year.

Command Petroleum, the Australian energy exploration and development

group whose primary interests are South Australia's Cooper Basin.
Command said the 4.1m shares had been bought during the past six months, at
an average price of ADollars 1.21 a share.
The company's total outlay on the stake stood at ADollars 4.97m (USDollars
3.86m).
Crusader, 49 per cent owned by Triton Energy in the US, closed 1 cent higher
on the news, at ADollars 1.41.
Command was unchanged at 42 cents.
In November, there were significant board changes at Crusader, with three
local directors departing and being replaced by Triton executives, giving
the Dallas-based group control of the Crusader board.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Slocan rejects CDollars 715m
takeover bid by Canfor

Slocan Forest Products of Vancouver has dismissed a CDollars 715m (USDollars
511m) takeover bid by Canfor Corp, Canada's biggest lumber company, aimed at
creating one of the world's biggest sawn timber producers.
Rejection of the share-swap offer could set the stage for a protracted
struggle for Slocan, which has no controlling shareholder.
Canfor has offered to swap each Slocan share for 0.935 of its own common
shares. This amounts to a one-third premium on Slocan's share price prior to
the bid. Canfor's offer is due to expire on January 10.
Describing the Canfor bid as a 'gamble' for Slocan shareholders, Mr Irving
Barber, Slocan chairman and chief executive, said they 'would be at the
mercy of the discretionary conditions established by Canfor'.
The conditions include approval by British Columbia's forestry ministry on
terms acceptable to Canfor.
'At the end of the day, Canfor will have an option to back out of the deal
four months later,' Mr Barber said.
Canfor has proposed to conclude the deal by initially issuing deposit
receipts, which would be converted into shares only after regulatory
approvals.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: US bank cancels contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bankers Trust, the US bank which recently bowed to regulators over some
parts of its derivatives activities, has agreed to cancel two foreign
currency derivative contracts sold to a customer in the US.
The customer, Federal Paper, said it was planning to take a Dollars 12m
pre-tax gain in the current quarter following the cancellation of the two
contracts.
It had earlier reported pre-tax losses of Dollars 19m on the contracts,
which it said were forward contracts (agreements to buy or sell a currency
at some time in the future) and caps (option-type contracts which put a
limit on an interest rate or foreign currency liability). Eastman Kodak said
it had extinguished a further Dollars 1.7bn of debt, taking to Dollars 6.4bn
the total debt it had erased this year and completing its debt-reduction
programme.

<TEXT>
Monsanto, the US chemicals company, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.07bn for a
specialty chemicals subsidiary of Merck which will have sales this year of
only about Dollars 300m.
Fears that Monsanto was paying too much sent its shares down Dollars 6 1/8
in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. However, they rallied
slightly to close at Dollars 68 7/8 , a loss of Dollars 4. The decline also
reflected market concerns that the company was shifting its attention away
from cutting costs.
Monsanto said it would use cash and debt to buy Kelco, a company which makes
stabilising and gelling agents for food and industrial products. The sale is
the last in a series of planned disposals of non-core businesses announced
by Merck in August.
'It's a great business, but the price is way too high,' said Mr Paul Raman,
a chemicals analyst at S. G. Warburg in New York. Monsanto was paying about
Dollars 150m too much for the company, or Dollars 1.50 a share, based on
Kelco's estimated earnings before tax, interest and amortisation of Dollars
120m, he said.
Monsanto said the transaction would be beneficial financially.

Scott Paper said it would use the after-tax proceeds of Dollars 1.6bn from
recently announced asset sales to buy back its own shares and pay off debt.
About Dollars 300m of the money would be used in a stock repurchase
programme, while the rest would be used to retire debt, the company said.
The cash was raised through the sale of S. D. Warren, a coated paper
subsidiary, for Dollars 1.6bn and the disposal of an energy business in
Alabama for Dollars 350m.

Monsanto, the US chemicals company, has agreed to pay Dollars 1.07bn for a
specialty chemicals subsidiary of Merck which will have sales this year of
only about Dollars 300m.
Fears that Monsanto was paying too much sent its shares into a sharp fall on
the New York Stock Exchange yesterday morning. By lunchtime they had dropped
to Dollars 66 3/4 , a loss of Dollars 6 1/8 . The steep decline also
reflected market concerns that the company was shifting its attention away
from cutting costs.
Monsanto said it would use cash and debt to buy Kelco, a company which makes
stabilising and gelling agents for food and industrial products. The sale is
the last in a series of planned disposals of non-core businesses announced

'It's a great business, but the price is way too high,' said Mr Paul Raman,

Dollars 150m too much for the company, or Dollars 1.50 a share, based on
Kelco's estimated earnings before tax, interest and amortisation of Dollars
120m, he said.
Monsanto said the transaction would be beneficial financially, and brought
it a business which had good growth potential and offered synergies with
some of its existing operations.
'We knew that it would take some time for the market to understand this
acquisition,' Monsanto said. The deal would add to cashflow next year, and
would enhance earnings per share in 1996, it added. The company said any
dilution to earnings per share next year would be minimal, and may be
avoided altogether.
The deal could add Dollars 800m to Monsanto's debt, which stood at Dollars
1.7bn at the end of September. The company plans to pay for Kelco with about
half of its cash reserves, which it expects to stand at about Dollars 550m
at the end of this year, with the rest financed with mainly short-term debt.

The Volkswagen group expects to show a small net profit this year on

Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.
The German company, which last year lost DM1.94bn, said yesterday it had
increased deliveries of vehicles to customers by about 200,000 to 3.3m,
gaining most in north American and Asia-Pacific markets.
In western Europe, where market share fell half a percentage point to 16 per
cent this year, sales grew only 2.3 per cent.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Stet expects 30% earnings gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Stet, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications holding company, announced
yesterday that its net consolidated profit should reach about L2,000bn
(Dollars 1.2bn) in 1994, 30 per cent higher than last year.
The announcement comes in the wake of Stet's launch of an international
newspaper advertising campaign, aimed at softening up investors and
impressing potential strategic partners ahead of further privatisation in
1995.
Following a board meeting yesterday, the company said it expected turnover
to surpass L34,000bn for 1994. In 1993, it announced a net consolidated
profit of L1,539bn on turnover of L29,800bn. The underlying increase in
turnover this year will be about 9 per cent, if the effect of absorbing
Iritel, the old government department responsible for international and
long-distance traffic, is stripped out.
Stet said debt would come down to just over L19,000bn by December 31,
against L22,085bn at the end of last year.
The group is one of Italy's five largest quoted companies, but 64.2 per cent
of the shares are held by IRI, the state holding company.
Stet in turn owns 62 per cent of Telecom Italia, the quoted operating
company, which came into being this year following the merger of five
separate state-controlled telecoms companies, as well as holdings in
software, multimedia and equipment subsidiaries and international joint
ventures.
The Italian government committed itself in October to sell a further tranche
of shares in Stet by June next year. Analysts fear political turmoil could
put that timetable in jeopardy, particularly if the establishment of a
regulatory authority for the sector is delayed.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tokyo relaxes listing
requirements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday announced reforms to its restrictive
listing requirements, to attract companies from fast-growing Asian
economies.
Mr Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, the exchange president, said the new rules would
open the market to smaller companies and reduce listing costs, making Tokyo
similar to the New York Stock Exchange. China and other Asian countries had
shown strong interest, he added.
The measures, which make the infamously expensive and complex Tokyo capital
market more open, are likely to win wide support.
A foreign securities company manager, however, pointed out that deeper
changes may be needed to stimulate Japanese financial institutions' appetite
for foreign equities, another important ingredient in attracting foreign
companies to Tokyo.
The changes, to take effect on January 1, include looser financial reporting
requirements intended to restrain the exodus of foreign groups.
The high cost of being listed in Tokyo, plus the globalisation of equity
trading, lowered the number of foreign companies listed there from a peak of
127 in 1990, to 91 next month. No companies from other Asian countries are
listed in Tokyo.
From next month, foreign company shares will be permitted on the TSE even if
not listed on their domestic markets. The cost of officially vetting a
candidate for a Tokyo listing will be halved to Y1m (Dollars 9,970) as will
the initial fixed cost of the listing, to Y2.5m.
There will be reductions in the annual cost of maintaining a Tokyo
quotation, linked to the number of shares listed.
The size of companies allowed on the Tokyo market is to be cut to a tenth of
the former requirement, a gesture to the many young Asian businesses seeking
equity capital.
From January, they will need net assets of only Y10bn, against Y100bn, and a
three-year record of minimum annual pre-tax profits of Y2bn, also a tenth of
the former size.
Foreign companies listed in Tokyo will no longer be obliged to translate
full annual reports into Japanese, although a shorter Japanese language
financial statement will be required for Japanese shareholders. There will
be no need to issue new reports on items that remain unchanged from one year
to the next.
In an attempt to stimulate investors, the minimum trading unit will be cut
from Y3m to Y500,000. From February, there will be a new authorised trading
block of 500 shares. Currently, foreign shares can only be traded in blocks
of 10, 50, 100 or 1,000.
A similar relaxation in listing rules for foreign bonds was announced
yesterday. Minimum net assets required of foreign bond issuers are reduced
to Y10bn, a tenth of the old size. They will only need to show three years
of Y10bn pre-tax profits, down from Y100bn.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Arthur Andersen widens lead
</HEADLINE>

   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Andersen, the US based accountancy firm, has widened its lead over
its competitors in terms of worldwide fee income, according to the annual
survey undertaken by the International Accounting Bulletin.
Andersen's fee income rose 12 per cent to Dollars 6.74bn allowing it to
increase its lead at the top of the league. Nearly 50 per cent of fees came
from Andersen Consulting, the business services arm.
The bulk of Andersen's growth was registered in the Americas and the
Asia-Pacific regions.
'The survey recorded a Big Six average fee income growth of 4.6 per cent.
This confirms that the effects of the recession, which took its toll on
accountants' incomes in the early part of the decade, have abated,' said
Lafferty Publications, survey publishers.
Results from KPMG Peat Marwick in the UK showed signs of a strong recovery.
It recorded a 5 per cent growth in fee income to Pounds 516.4m (Dollars
846.89m) for the year to September 1994 from Pounds 491.8m in the previous
year.
Worldwide, KPMG, which until last year was the highest earner, saw fee
income grow 1.7 per cent to Dollars 6.1bn. In third place was Ernst &amp; Young
at Dollars 6.01bn - an increase on the previous year of 3 per cent.
In fourth place was Coopers &amp; Lybrand with a 4 per cent rise to Dollars
5.5bn, with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International in fifth at Dollars
5.2bn. Price Waterhouse, BDO Binder, Grant Thornton International, and
Moores Rowland International followed behind.
RSM International, placed tenth, grew 14 per cent to reach fee income of
Dollars 784m.

debt
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An Ontario court has ordered Goldman Sachs and Cadillac Fairview, one of
Canada's biggest property groups, to negotiate further on ways to
restructure more than CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn) of Cadillac debt.
The New York investment banker went to court on Monday in Toronto asking the
judge to put Cadillac under the Companies Creditors' Arrangement Act.
Goldman indirectly holds CDollars 1bn of Cadillac's senior debt on which
interest is in default, and could legally force Cadillac to reorganise under
court protection.
The judge gave temporary assent, but Cadillac's lawyers soon obtained a
reversal.
Mr Justice James Farley directed Goldman and Cadillac to meet this week and
negotiate on the financial restructuring.
Cadillac is protected from legal action until both parties reappear in court
this Friday.
Goldman believes Cadillac's restructuring could be achieved faster under
court protection, with better terms for senior creditors. Debt would be
converted to equity and senior debt holders would end up with 93 per cent
control.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc to sell acetics
operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, plans to sell its European
acetics business to Acetex, a newly-formed Canadian chemical company. The
deal is part of the French group's strategy of moving out of low-margin
basic commodity chemicals.
Acetex was recently formed by Mr Brooke Wade, former head and founder of
Methanex which has become the world's largest producer of methanol, the raw
material used in making acetics. The latter substance is used in textiles,
adhesives, paint, perfume and other products.
The planned sale includes Rhone-Poulenc's manufacture of acetic acid and
monovinyl acetate at Pardies in south-west France with annual capacity of
480,000 tonnes.
In addition, there is a franchise to buy the output of Rhone-Poulenc's
solvent factories in eastern and central France, which will stay in the
French group's hands, and its 40 per cent stake in Erkol, a Spanish company
which makes polyvinyl alcohol.
Neither Rhone-Poulenc nor Acetex would put a price on the sale, which for
the moment excludes the former's smaller acetics business in Brazil.
This operation has an annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes of acetic acid and
monovinyl acetate. Total turnover of Rhone-Poulenc's European and Brazilian
acetics operations is about FFr2bn (Dollars 369m) a year.
Acetex said it might be interested in buying the Brazilian operation but
this was not under negotiation.
Last August, Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, said he hoped
by the end of 1995 to sell Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn worth of assets, mainly
in basic commodity chemicals, to reinforce the group's presence in
specialised higher-value 'performance' products.
Yesterday, the company said that although it was the third largest world
producer of acetics, it was well behind Hoechst of Germany and British
Petroleum, and that to improve its position would require large resources
which it preferred to use else- where.
Rhone-Poulenc recently announced the sale of its TD1 polyurethane foam
business to Arco, the US chemical group.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: Restructuring of French property
group agreed
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday agreed to a restructuring of Comptoir des
Entrepreneurs, the heavily loss-making property company, in a deal that
clears a large hurdle for the privatisation of Assurance Generale de France,
the insurance group.
CdE is to be permitted to remove FFr7bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in property
provisions from its balance sheet, which will be guaranteed by a
com-bination of the state and its larger creditors and shareholders.
The restructuring is the second in two years for CdE, and follows a FFr5.5bn
guarantee provided by the French state in 1993, when the group published
losses of FFr823m. Similar losses are expected in the current year.
The government will now underwrite up to FFr4.5bn of the provisions, and can
cancel a FFr2.5bn bond issue it promised for the start of next year as part
of the previous restructuring plan.
AGF, which currently holds a 29.74 per cent stake in the group, will become
the majority shareholder by injecting finance of a further FFr400m.
Further financial guarantees will come from other creditors to CdE, which
will have their loans converted into senior debt.
The deal removes an uncertainty in the exposure to losses of the group by
AGF, which contributed to the delays in its privatisation.
Last year it took a FFr225m charge as a result of the losses at CdE.
The chairman of AGF said in October that the group was planning for its
privatisation by the end of January or the start of February.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the minister of economics, has said that he wanted to
proceed with the privatisation 'as soon as possible', although this will
depend on 'market conditions', including the position of the bond markets.
Another outstanding issue is the sale of AGF's life assurance products
through an effective monopoly thanks to a contract it has with the French
post office.
This is currently up for renegotiation and is being contested by other
private insurance companies.

The top management of Trafalgar House, the engineering and property
conglomerate, yesterday took its battle for Northern Electric to the
takeover target's Tyneside heartland, writes Chris Tighe.
Mr Nigel Rich, above right, Trafalgar chief executive, and Mr Simon Keswick,
chairman, posed for photographers on Newcastle Quayside before holding a
press conference in the nearest hotel to the rec's city centre headquarters.
They were accompanied by Mr Rodney Leach, strategy and finance director, and
also by the senior executives of five of the Trafalgar companies based in
north-east England, to underline the conglomerate's existing links with the
region.
Although they were, physically at least, only yards apart the two management
teams did not meet, despite Trafalgar requests. 'We don't think there's any
basis for a conversation at this stage', said Northern Electric.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Mid-States intent on Nasdaq quote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mid-States, the US motor parts distributor quoted on the USM, said yesterday
it still intended to proceed with its application to be traded on the US
Nasdaq market.
Shares in the company have halved this year from a high of 122p in late
January to a low for the year of 61p on Monday because of repeated delays to
its planned Dollars 15m (Pounds 9m) American Depositary Receipts issue. The
shares rallied 2p to 63p yesterday.
The listing is primarily aimed at moving away from a mainly UK shareholder
base and attracting American investors to the company, which operates
through its subsidiary, Mid-State Automotive Distributors of Nashville,
Tennessee.
Instead of placing the new issue straight away, the company now intends to
list the minimum number of existing shares on Nasdaq early next year. A new
issue would come later.
In the nine months to September 30 turnover improved to Pounds 58.7m (Pounds
48m) while pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 4.85m (Pounds 4.61m). Gearing at
the period end was 44 per cent.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: TSB sells Irish bank's loan book
for IPounds 116m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Group, the UK's sixth largest bank, has closed its Irish operations with
the sale of the loan book of its Irish Business Bank subsidiary to Anglo
Irish Bank for IPounds 116m (Pounds 114.6m).
Anglo Irish said the sum represented the net book value; the gross value was
IPounds 140m, the difference being the provision for bad and doubtful debts.
Mr Peter Killen, Anglo Irish's executive director responsible for risk
assets, said the new loan book, comprising about 400 accounts in the
medium-sized corporate and professional market, reflected the spread of the
existing specialised areas of business and would take its risk assets above
IPounds 1bn.
Three years ago, Anglo Irish entered talks about buying Hill Samuel
(Ireland), as Irish Business Bank was formerly known. Negotiations broke
down the following April after completion of the due diligence process left
the two sides unable to agree on a price.
The deal announced yesterday, which is subject to regulatory approval, would
be fully funded from Anglo Irish's own resources, Mr Killen said.
The TSB subsidiary had virtually stopped new lending during the last couple
of years and the emphasis had been on structuring the operation in a form
that would attract buyers. A total of 37 jobs will be lost.
The disposal marks the end of a process of withdrawal by TSB from Ireland
over the last few years as the group moves to concentrate on its UK
business.
In April this year it sold the Hill Samuel Fagan Investment Management
business to Allied Irish Banks for an undisclosed amount. In 1992, UDT Bank,
part of Hill Samuel Ireland, was sold to Woodchester Investments, the
Dublin-based leasing and financial services group, for IPounds 23.4m cash.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Sun Life blocks plan to restructure I&amp;S
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund manager, risks defeat in its effort
to restructure British Assets Trust, its flagship investment trust,
following opposition from the trust's largest institutional shareholder.
Sun Life, with an 11.06 per cent stake, has voted against the restructuring
proposals. 'We do not consider the proposals are in the interests of
shareholders,' said Mr Jim Stride of Sun Life Investment Managers. 'They are
unnecessarily complex.'
In particular, Sun Life is concerned that the restructuring would create
76.8m new shares seven years from now, the dividends of which would have to
be financed by the trust's total returns.
Also, some shareholders and investment trust analysts have questioned
whether I&amp;S, which earned Pounds 2.8m in fees managing both British Assets
and its sister investment trust, Investors Capital Trust, deserves to
continue as fund manager. The net asset value of British Assets, which owns
about 65 per cent of Investors Capital, fell 7.6 per cent last year while
the FT-SE-A All-Share Index rose 0.3 per cent.
Some analysts are asking whether there should be resignations from the
boards of both companies, which overlap considerably. Directors of both
trusts earned an aggregate Pounds 76,000 in the year to September 30, up
from Pounds 70,000 the year before. Mr Roger Inglis, chairman of British
Assets, is due to retire next June.
One of British Asset's directors is a director of Ivory &amp; Sime TrustLink,
set up to promote investment trusts in the retail market. British Assets is
committed to investing Pounds 1.6m in the project by 1997.
Sun Life is expected to call for a poll at an extraordinary meeting in
Edinburgh tomorrow, forcing all proxy votes to be counted. I&amp;S will need at
least 126m shares to vote in favour to achieve the necessary 75 per cent
approval.
Institutional investors with 61.4m shares have already said they will
support restructuring. I&amp;S has launched a campaign to encourage its personal
equity plan clients, who own roughly 15m shares, and other retail clients to
vote in favour. Mr Gordon Neilly, finance director, said that of the private
investors who had voted so far, '99.9 per cent have voted in favour'.
The Pounds 600m trust had sold shares with the promise that it would pay
annual dividends increasing each year in line with inflation. While the
investments had a return sufficient to cover the promised dividend in the
late 1980s, more recently it has been paying out more than its investments
earned. As a result reserves are down to 47 per cent of last year's dividend
bill.
The trust already has sufficient volunteers for the restructuring proposals
to cut its dividend bill by 16 per cent. Those willing to forgo dividend
income would exchange 25 ordinary shares for 21, plus four new growth shares
with five warrants attached, exerciseable into ordinary shares at the net
asset value on the date of restructuring.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Wessex ahead 9% and sees scope for further
cost cutting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wessex Water drew the industry interim reporting season to a close yesterday
with a 9 per cent increase in profits and 10 per cent dividend rise.
The pre-tax return improved from Pounds 53.4m to Pounds 58.2m for the six
months to September 30 on sales 5 per cent ahead to Pounds 114.1m.
Mr Nick Hood, chairman, said the profits performance reflected tight control
of operating costs through job losses and initiatives such as abolishing
company cars for all employees, including the board.
Operating expenses in the core utility business fell by 4 per cent, leaving
Wessex with its lowest costs in three years. The regulated businesses
returned operating profits 11 per cent ahead to Pounds 52.9m.
The interim dividend is increased from 4p to 4.4p, on earnings 5 per cent
ahead to 20.1p. Mr Hood said he was confident there was plenty of scope to
improve earnings through further cost-cutting. This would allow Wessex to
sustain dividend increases above the rate of inflation.
Mr Hood warned, however, that political interference, such as increasing
regulation or windfall taxes, in the regime established by the industry
regulator could damage the incentives water companies have to improve
services and earnings. 'If we are interfered with, we could be damaged and
the person who would suffer at the end of the day is the customer,' Mr Hood
said.
Wessex' share of profits from Wessex Waste Management, the joint venture
with Waste Management Industries, increased by 10 per cent to Pounds 4.6m.
Most of the improvement was due to acquisitions, although prices were
increased by about 3 per cent.
Mr Hood said he was confident the waste business would move forward. 'Each
month that passes confirms my belief that we made the right choice in our
diversification.'
The market was not convinced, however. Wessex shares fell from 289p to 282p
after the results, reflecting some disappointment with the non-regulated
business. 'The results were OK,' said one analyst, 'but it did not look as
though the waste business was really motoring'.
Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 117m and a total dividend of
13.2p this year, giving a yield of just below 6 per cent, leaving the shares
looking fairly valued at present.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Terra Nova acquired by Bermuda operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Terra Nova, the privately-owned London insurance and reinsurance group, has
been acquired by a group of mostly US investors, via a new Bermuda holding
company, as a prelude to seeking a NYSE listing.
The new holding company will also own an operation in the expanding Bermuda
reinsurance market, making Terra Nova one of only a handful of companies
with a significant presence both on the island and in the London market.
Mr John Riddick, managing director, said the Bermuda base would attract US
investors because of its tax and regulatory regime. 'The successful
(reinsurance) companies of the future will be those which are able to access
the capital markets of the world. The scope for privately-held reinsurance
companies is limited,' he said.
He envisaged the company floating within two years. It reported a pre-tax
operating profit of Pounds 27.3m last year.
Terra Nova has raised Dollars 106m (Pounds 65m) in equity from an expanded
shareholder base and Dollars 85m in debt from US and UK banks via a
syndicated loan. A large part of the funds has been used to buy back shares.
The holdings of the existing three main shareholders - Aetna Life &amp; Casualty
and Cigna Corporation, the US insurance companies, and Marsh &amp; McLennan, the
world's largest insurance broker - will be cut from about 80 per cent to 38
per cent.
The holding company has acquired Underwriters Capital (Merrett), a Bermudian
reinsurance company formed last year to provide reinsurance facilities to
Lloyd's syndicates managed by the Merrett Underwriting agency. With the
Merrett syndicates now in run-off, the Bermuda company has, in effect, been
dormant.
UCM has been renamed Terra Nova (Bermuda) Insurance and will have an initial
capitalisation of Dollars 55m.

FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: BAS plans new year flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAS International Holdings, a supplier of low-cost consumer stationary, soft
toys and giftware, announced yesterday its intention to make its Stock
Exchange debut in the new year.
Although few details are available, the Manchester-based group plans to
raise about Pounds 12m by issuing new shares and hopes to be valued at
Pounds 20m to Pounds 30m on flotation.
Mr Graham Hallworth, finance director, said the fresh funds would be used to
finance organic growth in the distribution business, such as product
development, acquisitions and a new distribution centre in north-west
England.
BAS operates through four subsidiaries. It is owned by Mr Martin Abramson,
chairman and founder, who has a 70 per cent stake, and Mr Tyrone Farber and
Mr Richard Rosenburg, both managing directors, who hold 15 per cent each.
Total annual sales are about Pounds 22m and pre-tax profits for 1994 are
forecast at Pounds 2m, against Pounds 992,000.
Panmure Gordon is sponsor to the issue.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Treasury to get Pounds 960m from sale of
British Coal's assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to receive nearly Pounds 960m from the sale of British
Coal's mining assets, it emerged yesterday as details were announced of the
sale of the south Wales region.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the government had agreed that Celtic
Energy, a management buy-out team, would acquire British Coal's south Wales
coal company for Pounds 94.5m.
He announced several weeks ago that RJB Mining was paying Pounds 815m for
the English regions and Mining (Scotland) Pounds 39.4m for the Scottish
region plus Pounds 10m for stocks.
The Pounds 958.9m total is considerably more than analysts expected when the
government invited bids for the regions earlier this year - most estimates
were about Pounds 500m. Some believe the successful bidders may have offered
too much and risk running into financial difficulties.
Mr Eggar said Celtic would pay Pounds 88.4m on completion of the south Wales
deal. Of the balance, Pounds 4.9m would be payable with interest in
instalments over the three following years. Final payment of Pounds 1.2m is
expected in two instalments, with interest, in 1999 and 2000.
He said the bid price had been adjusted to reflect developments since
tenders were submitted in September or information that was not available at
the time.
Celtic's bid price following these adjustments still 'represents best value
for money'.
British Coal yesterday signed an agreement to sell its 67 per cent interest
in Inter-Continental Fuels, a coal trading company, to RTZ and Coal
Investments. It is also selling its 50 per cent stake in IMC Holdings, which
provides consultancy and engineering services to energy and mineral
companies, to ICF.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Second half boost for Eurotherm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong second-half sales growth helped Eurotherm, the industrial process
control equipment supplier, report a 30 per cent increase in full year
pre-tax profits.
On turnover up by 6.1 per cent to Pounds 168m (Pounds 158.4m) profits
increased from Pounds 20.1m to Pounds 26.1m in the year to October 31,
highlighting the group's strong operational gearing.
Turnover grew by 11 per cent in the second half offsetting a sluggish 1.9
per cent increase in the first six months and re-establishing Eurotherm on a
solid growth track.
Mr Claes Hultman, chief executive, said: 'Early signs for the current
financial year are that this growth is continuing.'
Earnings per share rose by 28 per cent from 15.1p to 19.4p and a final
dividend of 3.5p is recommended, making a total for the year up 16 per cent
at 5.5p (4.75p).
The shares closed unchanged at 400p.
All divisions achieved higher sales helped by new product launches. However,
the strongest advance came in the drives division where sales rose by 16.7
per cent. Internationally the biggest sales increases were in the UK and
North America.
However, Mr Jack Leonard, chairman, noted that, 'as the year progressed,
there has been a growing recovery in the rest of Europe with Sweden and
Benelux performing exceptionally well'.
Tight cost control helped maintain gross profit margins at 50.3 per cent
while administrative expenses fell slightly and operating profits increased
by 27 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 20.1m).
Pre-tax profits were boosted by Pounds 500,000 of net interest income
reflecting the group's strengthening net cash balances which increased by
Pounds 14.8m to Pounds 21.6m over the year.
COMMENT
Despite the lacklustre market response Eurotherm's latest results will go
some way to silencing critics who, while acknowledging management's success
over the past four years in restoring profitability and strengthening the
balance sheet, have been looking for evidence of organic sales growth. The
management is confident that it can keep turnover moving ahead by between 10
and 15 per cent a year, helped by the group's investment in new product
development including a new line of temperature controllers. On this basis
pre-tax profits should reach about Pounds 31m this year producing earnings
of 23p. Despite this the shares are trading on a sizeable 38 per cent
premium to the market, and the upside potential therefore looks somewhat
limited.

<TEXT>
A special dividend of 85p announced in October by East Midlands Electricity
gave an unexpected boost to earnings at I&amp;S Optimum Income Trust.
The rec is the largest holding in the Ivory &amp; Sime-managed trust's
portfolio. At end-May its stake was valued at Pounds 3.67m.
On available revenue of Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.18m) earnings for the six
months to November 30 improved to 5.79p (4.06p) per share. A second interim
dividend of 1.95p brings the total to date to 3.9p. At yesterday's share
price of 84 1/2 p, this represents an implied annualised gross yield of 11.5
per cent.
Net asset value rose 5.4 per cent to 94.95p (90.08p) in the period, against
a 3.7 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100 Index.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems fell 12p to 85p as the
USM-traded computer services group reported a deficit of Pounds 3.28m.
The outcome for the six months to October 31 compared with a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 201,000 and a loss of Pounds 746,000 at the year end. It was
struck after an exceptional Pounds 2.4m relating mainly to restructuring.
Turnover slipped from Pounds 13.1m to Pounds 11m, including Pounds 403,000
(Pounds 1.84m) from discontinued activities.
Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, said the results had been dominated by
reorganisation, adding that the company was 'confident of returning to
profit' in the second half, but any dividend 'now seems unlikely'.
Losses per share came out at 13.7p (earnings of 1p).

Minmet has ended discussions with Gulf Exploration Consultants over its
possible acquisition of the Dublin-based electronic information, mining and
exploration group. Instead, Emerging Money, its information services
division, has been sold to Gulf, a US shell company in which Minmet has a
significant stake.
Mr Paul Bristol, Minmet chairman, said: 'It is better if Gulf is seen to be
providing only financial information, rather than being muddled together
with our other businesses.'
Minmet exchanged the assets of Emerging Money in return for 37.9m shares in
Gulf, taking its stake to 60 per cent.
Gulf intends to revive its listing on Nasdaq in the new year.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: SCI bid for Plantsbrook referred to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has referred the acquisition of
Plantsbrook, the funerals group, by Service Corporation International to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The MMC has been asked to examine the supply of funeral services,
particularly in south and central London, because of SCI's high market
share.
SCI made the initial recommended bid on September 2, valuing Plantsbrook at
Pounds 193m. The acquisition, which was not conditional on clearance by the
competition authorities, was completed on October 20. The DTI received
advice on the takeover from the Director General of Fair Trading on November
24.
In August SCI, the largest funerals company in the US, won a takeover battle
for Great Southern Group, another leading UK funeral company.
If the MMC advises the DTI that the Plantsbrook acquisition is against the
public interest, in theory the DTI could require the acquisition to be
unwound. It could alternatively require that parts of the company be sold or
impose restrictions on its operations.
Mr Jerald Pullins, chief executive officer of SCI UK, said: 'Because of the
limited (geographical) scope of the investigation, we do not believe that it
will affect the overall transaction.'
At the time of the Plantsbrook bid, it was thought that the pre-paid funeral
market would be likely to prompt a referral to the MMC. SCI has a 15 per
cent share of the UK funeral market, but an estimated 80 per cent of the
pre-paid market, through Plantsbrook's Dignity in Destiny scheme and Great
Southern's Chosen Heritage plan.
The Office of Fair Trading is separately conducting an investigation into
regulations in the pre-paid funeral market. A report is expected in
February.
The MMC is required to report back to the DTI by March 24.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Options ameliorate Hoerner pay cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Hoerner, chief executive of Burton Group, saw his salary fall from
Pounds 739,000 to Pounds 597,000 last year, according to the retailer's
annual report, writes Neil Buckley.
He may not be too downhearted, however. At yesterday's share price of 68p,
he is sitting on a paper profit of more than Pounds 950,000 on share options
which become exercisable before the end of June.
In the year to September 3, Mr Hoerner's basic salary and taxable benefits
fell from Pounds 453,000 to Pounds 422,000.
The company said this was due to a reduction in taxable benefits to come
into line with corporate governance guidelines - which involved Mr Hoerner
giving up one of his two company cars.
Mr Hoerner's performance-related bonus also fell, from Pounds 171,000 to
Pounds 60,000, as pre-tax profit - although ahead from Pounds 16.3m to
Pounds 41.1m - did not perform as well against targets set by the
remuneration committee as in the previous year. His pension contribution was
unchanged at Pounds 115,000.
Mr Richard North, former finance director who joined Bass after leaving
Burton in July, earned between Pounds 555,000 and Pounds 560,000, including
a special bonus of Pounds 263,000 - equivalent to one year's salary - for
'securing the group's financial stability'.

rise
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Andrews Sykes, the industrial services group, rose 21p yesterday
to close at a high of 158p. The board said it was 'not aware of any reason
for the increase'.
Earlier in the day it announced the appointment of two new directors one of
whom is Mr Jean Jacques Murray who won effective control of the company
following a prolonged boardroom battle which ended in May.
European Fire Protection, Mr Murray's private Dutch company, owns 59.5 per
cent of Andrews Sykes and he becomes a non-executive director. Mr John Hall,
operations director of the group's main subsidiary, was appointed an
executive director.
Andrews Sykes, which has been undergoing a restructuring, reported a Pounds
1.96m loss in the six months to September 30.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Increased offer turns off leaks -
Christopher Price considers De La Rue's negotiations with Portals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was perhaps appropriate that the final stages of negotiations between De
La Rue and Portals should be disrupted by a burst water pipe.
The eight month courtship, involving two separate approaches, has sprung so
many leaks that it has prompted at least one Stock Exchange inquiry,
emergency statements to calm nervous investors and enormous volatility in
the Portals' share price.
Aside from its leaking pipe, last weekend's meeting at Schroders, De La
Rue's advisers, marked the final attempt by the fiercely independent Portals
board to dissuade De La Rue from making a formal offer for the specialist
paper making group.
Mr John Lloyd, Portals managing director, said the board had eventually been
swayed by the amount of money on offer. 'We believed we had a great future
as an independent company, but at the end if the day, we must look after the
interests of our shareholders.'
One adviser to Portals said that he was for rejecting the De La Rue offer of
Pounds 10.50 a share in favour of prompting a hostile bid from the banknote
printing group. 'I felt we would be looking at closer to Pounds 12 a share
in a contested takeover.'
Mr Lloyd said: 'The board, our bankers and advisers all felt the De La Rue
offer was a good one. It's as simple as that.'
He added that the company's renowned low corporate profile, reflecting the
corresponding high profile of its international central bank customers, was
a factor in not wishing to get involved in a protracted takeover battle.
De La Rue has also emphasised the need to maintain its conservative and
measured reputation in the security-conscious banknote industry. In both its
approaches the group stated that it would not make a hostile bid, stressing
it was seeking the agreement of the Portals board.
Portals was first approached by De La Rue in the spring, with informal talks
on co-operation, in particular in the area of new banknote and printing
technology.
'It became evident fairly early on that pooling our R&amp;D resources was going
to be difficult. That's when we started thinking about a full merger,' said
Mr Jeremy Marshall, De La Rue chief executive.
De La Rue was attracted by Portals' anti-counterfeiting technology which has
enabled it to produce ever-more sophisticated watermarks and speciality
threads in its banknotes.
However, from the beginning the discussions were plagued by leaks, to both
the stock market and the press. After the first approach in May, the two
companies were forced into confirming the talks after the Portals share
price jumped 20 per cent in four days. The Stock Exchange subsequently
launched an inquiry.
The shares tumbled a week later after talks were terminated. Sources close
to the negotiations said De La Rue offered about 900p a share, which was
rejected.
'We remained determined to convince them of the logic of the deal and we
analysed the situation further over the summer and came back with an even
stronger case second time around,' said Mr Marshall.
Early this month there was a re-run of the spring. Portals shares shot
forward, followed by emergency statements and talk of a Stock Exchange
inquiry. However, this time De La Rue came back with a higher, and finally,
acceptable offer.
'It's a very full price they are paying, but in the longer-term it should be
a good deal,' said Mr Alastair Irvine at Smith New Court.
He added that without any obvious costs being taken out by the merger,
short-term benefits were few. 'Strategically De La Rue has done the deal to
increase the durability of its banknote business. They believe security is
more in the paper side than in the printing.'
Mr Marshall said that the group would review Portals' non-core businesses,
including tea bag production and the protection and control division. He
said it was unlikely they would be sold if the sales were not earnings
enhancing.
One part of the business definitely being retained is Portals' mansion in
Hampshire, home to Mr Julian Sheffield, the group's chairman. He is to join
the De La Rue board and Mr Marshall said his agreement to stay in the house
until August 1996 would be honoured.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: New Coats pension manager
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coats Viyella, the clothing and textiles group, has scrapped the in-house
fund manager for its Pounds 1bn pension fund and is to use four independent
companies.
The move is part of a growing trend towards external fund management
reflecting the growing complexity and diversity of investment decision
making. ICI, the UK's 10th largest scheme, recently decided to close its
in-house fund manager.
It is understood the Coats' decision was made following significant
underperformance by the pension scheme in 1993, and marginal
underperformance relative to the industry average in the previous two or
three years.
In explaining the decision, Mr Sam Dow, company secretary, said the decision
reflected the fact that 'the investment waterfront is changing considerably'
rather than concerns about performance.
For instance, the increasing trend towards overseas investment, particularly
in emerging markets, would have required the addition of extra expertise.
Also, technology has become increasingly important. 'We would have had to
make a substantially greater investment in technology in order to give
ourselves the same tools that other investment managers have,' he said.
The company has selected Morgan Grenfell Asset Management and PDFM to run
two large funds investing in stocks and bonds. It has retained Foreign and
Colonial Investment Management to invest in overseas equities and M&amp;G, the
unit trust managers, to achieve above-average returns in UK equities.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Blackwood holders take BM to court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFF DYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three preference shareholders in Blackwood Hodge have filed a petition
against its parent, BM Group, in the High Court, claiming that its affairs
have been managed in a manner prejudicial to the interests of preference
shareholders.
Blackwood Hodge had net assets of Pounds 95m when BM acquired it in 1990. BM
made an offer for the three classes of its preference share capital on
October 26 this year. The offer closes tomorrow after which BM plans to put
Blackwood Hodge into liquidation.
One of the petitioners, Mr Stephen Cockburn, managing director of Investment
Company, which owns preference shares in Blackwood Hodge, said that he would
not now be making a rival offer for two classes of the shares.
Mr Cockburn, who also has a personal holding, said that if the petition was
successful he would not be entitled to relief on the shares acquired under
the offer.
The petition, filed on November 30, claims BM has undervalued the surplus
from the Blackwood Hodge pension fund, which was merged with BM's pension
fund at the time of the acquisition. BM's 1992 accounts value the surplus at
Pounds 15.3m. The BM offer says Blackwood Hodge has net liabilities of
Pounds 500,000. The petitioners claim that the pension fund surplus now has
a value of at least Pounds 5.6m, which would give Blackwood Hodge net assets
of Pounds 5m, radically changing the terms of the offer.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: PowerGen confirms share buy-back plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PowerGen has confirmed that it will buy back a portion of its shares when
the government offers its 40 per cent stake in the power generators for sale
early next year.
The move had been expected following National Power's announcement last
month that it would buy up to 8 per cent of its shares from the government.
PowerGen will buy a similar proportion, worth about Pounds 322m at Monday's
prices. However, the government will be able to claw back up to 1.5 per cent
to meet demand from investors in the public offer.
PowerGen will cancel the shares, thereby enhancing earnings per share by 2.5
to 3.5 per cent.
The move will also take the group a step closer to its goal of reducing
dividend cover to 2.5 from 2.7 times earnings.
The group said yesterday that the purchase would be financed from existing
facilities and anticipated cash flows. However, it is likely that year-end
gearing will only be slightly above last year's 15 per cent because other
borrowings have decreased.
Existing investment plans and further share repurchases would not be
affected.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Welbilt agrees Berisford offer - Pounds
317m rights issue to fund Pounds 295m purchase of US kitchen maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berisford International, the kitchens and joinery group, yesterday announced
a hefty 11-for-5 rights issue to fund a Pounds 295m offer for Welbilt, one
of the largest commercial kitchen manufacturers in the US.
In addition, the New York-based Kohlberg family, which controls 46.7 per
cent of Welbilt, has agreed to sell its shares to Berisford at a discount to
the price being offered to most shareholders. Mr Jerome Kohlberg is one of
the founders of the leveraged buy-out specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
Berisford is offering Dollars 33.75 (Pounds 20.50) a share to investors
representing the outstanding 53.3 per cent of Welbilt, against Dollars 30 a
share for the Kohlberg stake. In total, Berisford is offering Dollars 312.7m
for Welbilt, and will refinance the group's net debt of about Dollars
147.8m.
The deal will be funded through the issue of up to 334.25m units of 5 per
cent convertible unsecured loan stock, on the basis of 11 for every five
shares held, at 100p to raise Pounds 317.1m net of expenses. The units may
be converted from August at 245p. The issue will be underwritten by Barings,
the UK merchant bank, which with its US sister bank Dillon, Read put the
deal together.
The acquisition will almost double the size of Berisford, which earlier this
year bought Magnet, the kitchens and joinery manufacturer and retailer, for
Pounds 56m. That was also funded by a rights issue, then at 120p.
Mr Alan Bowkett, Berisford chief executive, said yesterday's rights was
likely to be the last equity fund raising for the next two to three years.
Berisford, which has net cash of Pounds 70m, expected to make only infill
acquisitions over the next 18 months.
An announcement has been expected since news about the talks leaked out in
London over the weekend.
Mr Bowkett said his company had approached the Kohlberg family when it
became apparent they wanted to sell their stake through a secondary public
offering in the US. The Kohlbergs have held the stake since buying out the
family owners in 1990.
Berisford was invited to make a bid for the whole company after extensive
due diligence and agreeing to pay a higher price to independent
shareholders.
The total costs of the deal are expected to be about Dollars 35m. This
includes the costs of buying out Welbilt bonds worth Dollars 100m at a
premium and underwriting costs of Dollars 12m.
Mr Bowkett said he was delighted with the acquisition, which would
materially enhance earnings in 1995. In the nine months to October 1,
Welbilt made operating profits of Dollars 36.4m on sales of Dollars 260.9m.
Berisford shares were suspended on Monday at 228p.

FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Authorities look at Attwoods intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The UK Takeover Panel has asked James Capel, the stockbrokers, for a full
report on its involvement in a surprise bid earlier this month by a small
Canadian company for Attwoods, the waste services operator.
Capel's Canadian affiliate, BBN James Capel, acted as an adviser to
Ontario-based Ikotek Waste Recycling Corporation, which appeared as a bidder
for Attwoods less than five hours before an offer by Browning-Ferris
Industries of Houston was due to expire.
BBN James Capel, which is owned equally by its managers and James Capel, is
understood to have breached the UK firm's internal procedures. The confusion
and uncertainty created by Ikotek's bid severely embarrassed the UK firm,
which was not immediately aware of its Toronto-based affiliate's
involvement.
The Canadian firm's two most senior executives, Mr John Stevens, president,
and Mr David Anderson, corporate finance director, left abruptly last week.
Capel has indicated that further internal repercussions are unlikely.
Mr Tony Pullinger, the Panel's secretary, said yesterday that 'we're still
interested in the matter, but haven't finished our deliberations.'
Ikotek's motives remain unclear. One person with links to the company said
yesterday that it was eager to find markets for a household waste-recycling
system, for which it holds the North American licence. Both Attwoods and BFI
have extensive waste-collection operations, which would be suitable outlets
for the Ikotek system.
The licence is held by Ikotek Europe, which is described as a group of
'engineering people and investors' with a small pilot plant in Switzerland.
Ikotek is a privately owned company, which is part of a group controlled by
Mr Helmut Sieber.
Under Panel rules, the timetable for shareholders to decide on an offer is
extended by 60 days if a competing bid appears. The Panel was unsure whether
to take Ikotek's bid seriously.
However, BFI won control of Attwoods within hours of Ikotek's intervention.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Danone takes the Bolshevik biscuit with Russian deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Danone, France's largest food group, plans to add some sweetness to one of
the most basic Russian foods as a result of its latest and most ambitious
acquisition in eastern Europe announced yesterday.
The food company best known for its yoghurts said it had acquired the
majority shareholding in Bolshevik, Russia's largest biscuit maker.
It aims to expand Bolshevik's range of dry biscuits, wafers and crackers
with chocolate-coated, filled and other more luxurious varieties.
Bolshevik, originally known as Sioux, was founded by a French entrepreneur
who moved to Moscow and started operations in 1855.
Danone said it had no intention of changing the Bolshevik brandname, even
though in the former Eastern bloc many streets and products with communist
associations have been renamed following the collapse of the former Soviet
Union. It said the brandname was very powerful with 30 per cent of the
Russian biscuit market. It cited the example of a successful Russian
confectionery brand which is still called Red October.
The company refused to provide details of the cost of the purchase. It
bought most of the shares from Alfa, a Russian investment fund that acquired
a number of shares after Bolshevik was privatised in 1992.
On top of the purchase of existing shares, Danone will make a Dollars 10m
(Pounds 6.0m) capital injection, bringing its total shareholding in the
enlarged group to 82.6 per cent. The remaining shares will be retained by
employees and Russian citizens.
Bolshevik, which employs about 2,500, produces 60,000 tonnes of biscuits and
last year reported turnover of Dollars 28m. The new money will be used to
introduce packaging measures and enlarge the product range.
Danone has been making acquisitions in eastern Europe since 1989, when it
launched yoghurt joint ventures in the former eastern Germany, followed by
similar operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria.
Yesterday's acquisition is the company's first move away from joint ventures
in the region and is only its second investment in Russia after a joint
venture agreed in May for the manufacture of yoghurt.

FT  21 DEC 94 / De La Rue wins Portals for Pounds 682m: Security printer
fulfils its paper dreams after eight-month chase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
De La Rue, the security printer, yesterday landed the prize it had been
pursuing for eight months when its Pounds 682m offer for Portals was
accepted by the board of the specialist paper manufacturer.
The move will give De La Rue, which specialises in printing banknotes,
control of one of its main paper suppliers and boost its access to Portals'
customer contacts among the world's central banks. De La Rue is also keen to
exploit Portals' anti-counterfeiting developments.
Portals' acceptance ends a courtship which began in May when De La Rue
initiated talks to pool research facilities.
More formal discussions on a possible offer followed, prompting the Portals
share price to rise and a Stock Exchange inquiry into how the news leaked
into the market.
The talks failed, reportedly overthe price being offered by De La Rue, only
to be rekindled earlier this month, with a similar response in the shares.
On both occasions, De La Rue specified that it would not make a hostile bid
for Portals.
Mr Jeremy Marshall, De La Rue's chief executive, said the move held great
potential for both companies. 'With Portals paper manufacturing and our
printing expertise, the enlarged group will be able to enjoy greater
technological focus, particularly in anti-counterfeiting, and a
strengthening of customer relationships.' In particular, it would also
enable the group to offer customers a fully-integrated banknote
manufacturing service. He added that the banknote facility would also fit
well with De La Rue's other security printing businesses.
He denied that, at nearly 31 times Portals' 1993 earnings per share, De La
Rue had offered too much. 'This is a long-term strategic deal which is
driven by our desire to increase the potential of the business, grow volumes
and take advantage of the latest technology.' He admitted, however, that
Portals' announcement last week of a Pounds 100m contract with the Indian
government 'made us sleep easier' over the price.
De La Rue expects the deal to dilute earnings slightly for the year to March
31 1995, be neutral in 1995-96 and enhance earnings the year after.
Portals shares, which stood at 705p before the latest approach, rose 60p to
Pounds 10.25 yesterday.
De La Rue is paying Pounds 403m in cash for Portals, with the rest being
paid by a fully underwritten issue of new shares. De La Rue's offer of nine
shares and Pounds 124 in cash for every 20 Portals shares values the latter
at Pounds 10.50 per share. Portals shareholders will be offered a full cash
alternative of Pounds 10.11 1/2 per share and a mix-and-match facility.
Mr Julian Sheffield, Portals chairman, will join De La Rue as a
non-executive director.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Microsoft delays launch of Windows 95 software again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft's share price dropped sharply yesterday when the software company
announced a further delay in the launch of Windows 95, a long-awaited new
version of the Windows personal computer program.
Microsoft said that shipping of the product may be delayed until August. It
had been expected to ship in May or June and already has been delayed by
more than a year. The postponement is expected to put off the launch of
Microsoft's planned on-line service, the Microsoft Network.
The delay reflects Microsoft's 'continued commitment to deliver a vigorously
tested product of the highest quality', the company said.
The announcement came in the wake of the discovery of a flaw in Intel's
Pentium microprocessor, and Microsoft's disclosure that the calculator
program in the current version of Windows is prone to errors.
'We have always said we will ship this product when it is ready, and that is
what we are committed to do,' said Mr Brad Silverberg, senior vice-president
of Microsoft's Personal Systems division.
A pre-release version of Windows 95 has been shipped to more than 48,000
testers, Microsoft said. The testing program will be expanded this spring.
'Feedback from our current beta testers has been excellent, they love the
product, but given the sheer breadth of Windows 95, shipping it may take us
longer than we had originally anticipated,' Mr Silverberg added.
Analysts called the delay 'disappointing' but noted that Windows 95 faces
little competition and that launching the product without thorough 'bug
fixing' could be more damaging. It is not yet clear, however, whether any
significant flaws have been found in prototype versions.
Mr Mike Brown, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said: 'Our top priority
is to deliver a high quality, reliable product, rather than trying to meet
targets for revenues from the product in any particular quarter.'
Microsoft has said that it expected to sell as many as 20m copies of Windows
95 in the first 12 months after the program is introduced.
Microsoft shares dropped by more than 4 per cent to Dollars 59 7/8 at the
close yesterday, from Monday's close of Dollars 62 5/8.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Regulator's hint led to Trafalgar Pounds 20 rebate offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By:BY CHRIS TIGHE and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar House, the conglom-erate mounting a hostile bid for Northern
Electric, decided to offer a Pounds 20 rebate to each of its 1.3m customers
at the prompting of Prof Stephen Littlechild, electricity industry
regulator.
Mr Brian Keelan, of Swiss Bank Corporation, advising Trafalgar, disclosed
yesterday that the rebate concept arose from a meeting about a month ago at
the regulator's office.
Mr Keelan said: 'Prof Littlechild made it clear it would be easier for him
to consider a bid for a regional electricity company that contained in its
terms a tangible benefit for the consumer, over and above the tariff
reduction that was published in August.
He added: 'Prof Littlechild decided he was Robin Hood. To walk us through
Sherwood Forest, the consumer would have to have something tangible, not a
statement of intentions or a warm and fuzzy feeling.'
Describing this as a 'hint', Mr Keelan said: 'We would probably have done
something like that anyway, but it's helpful to be guided by the regulator.'
Mr Keelan's comments, made at a press conference in Newcastle upon Tyne,
where Northern is based, will strengthen claims by Prof Littlechild's
critics that the regulatory regime, to take effect from April, is too lax.
'If Prof Littlechild believes Northern can afford to hand over Pounds 26m to
customers under a new management, why did he not ask the existing regime to
do it in August?' one analyst asked.
Shares in Northern and most other regional electricity companies fell
yesterday after Prof Littlechild published a consultation paper on
Trafalgar's bid. Although he reaches no firm conclusions in the paper, he
discusses the possibility of a referral of the bid to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
If Trafalgar were to take over Northern, he says, it would be the first time
a public electricity supply licence would be held by a subsidiary company
rather than its parent.
Prof Littlechild's initial view is that this is insufficient reason to bar a
takeover but he wants to consider licence changes in the event of takeovers.
He points to concerns about the resources a parent may provide to its
electricity subsidiary 'to enable it to undertake its functions' and says he
will be considering licence changes to take these into account.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Lessons of high volatility in the bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been a dreadful year for bond markets around the world. But the
past few months have brought modest signs of stability, if not recovery.
A year ago in this space I celebrated the wonderful performance of UK gilts
in 1993 as long yields sank to 6.5 per cent. It was a bonanza that was
unrepeatable in the circumstances of a vigorous economic recovery, I
concluded. But I should have been more cautious. The boom in bonds was
abruptly reversed as long gilt yields soared up again, briefly touching the
9 per cent level in September.
The overall 200 basis point rise in UK bond yields during 1994 has split two
ways. Half represents a rise in real yields, as demonstrated by index-linked
gilts, and this is attributable to stronger economic growth. The other half
can be blamed on implied expectations of higher future inflation, although
this is controversial, and it can also be argued that there have been
changes in risk premiums.
Certainly these adjustments appear to be primarily global rather than
national. US Treasury bond yields are about 250 basis points higher than a
year ago, and rises elsewhere have been 200 basis points in Germany and 150
basis points in Japan.
The scale of portfolio damage has depended upon the duration of the bonds
and on the currencies involved. The negative return on the old US Treasury
30-year bond has been 11 per cent so far this year, although the JP Morgan
US government bond index is only showing about minus 3 per cent.
Damage has been pronounced in a strong currency - the unhedged return on US
Treasuries for the Swiss investor was minus 18 per cent at its worst in
October. Long-dated Japanese yen bonds were dangerous to hold because the
proportional rise in yields was especially high, from a starting-point of
only 3.1 per cent. Yet the JP Morgan global government bond index is showing
a narrowly positive 1 per cent return to the dollar-based investor this
year.
The severity of the early 1993 shake-out reflected the forced unwinding of
huge speculative positions by hedge funds, banks and securities firms as
stop-loss limits were triggered.
Trillions were punted on yield curve strategies, and seemingly brilliant
professional slicers and hedgers of global market risks have, after hasty
visits to their lawyers, emerged reinvented as naive amateur punters
exploited by hustling derivatives salesmen.
The eventual consequences of this volatility have yet to be worked out. The
Bank of England has swallowed the argument that encouraging an active sale
and repurchase, or 'repo', market will increase liquidity and reduce the
cost of borrowing.
However, David Shaw of Legal &amp; General in London has calculated that on a
particular definition - the percentage change during six months in the FT
Government Securities Price Index - the early 1994 bear market in gilts was
the most severe since the tumble, during freak economic conditions, in 1974.
His conclusion is that the arrival of aggressive new bond market players,
overwhelming traditional long-term institutional investors, has raised
volatility. The risk premium on bonds over cash has therefore increased (and
the risk premium on equities against bonds has fallen). Finance ministries
might think about the implications.
Another factor has triggered high volatility, however - the growing role of
cross-border investors vulnerable to exchange rate risks. US Treasury bond
yields have had to rise a very long way this year because Japanese
institutions are refusing to plug the global financing gaps they filled in
the 1980s.
Mr William Sterling of Merrill Lynch in New York points out that the total
US external financing requirement ran at some Dollars 150bn (Pounds 91.4bn)
a year in the late 1980s, dipped briefly, but for the past two years has
jumped to Dollars 280bn annually. If the US is to cover a large part of this
deficit by selling financial assets to foreigners, the assets will have to
look much more keenly priced.
In 1994, certainly, dollar bonds have become cheaper, and have dragged down
bond prices everywhere.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Rebels snub PM's call to concede: Chance of permanent split
between government and nine Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of a permanent split between the government and nine Tory
Euro-rebels suspended from the parliamentary party was raised for the first
time yesterday after the group rejected Mr John Major's demand for an end to
the rebellion.
As the Commons rose for the Christmas recess, senior ministers said Mr Major
would stand by his insistence in a Financial Times interview that the rebels
must back the government for several months to regain the party whip.
But Mr Tony Marlow, a key organiser of the group, advised the prime minister
to declare a Christmas truce. 'If he does not do that there is a risk that
the momentum of circumstances will almost formalise the split,' he told BBC
radio. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said it was time for Mr Major
to end the suspension, imposed after eight of the rebels voted against
higher UK contributions to the EU. A ninth MP resigned the whip shortly
afterwards.
'The grown-up thing to do is for the teacher, in this case John Major, to
say 'that is enough',' Mrs Gorman said on BBC radio. 'It is for John to say
to us that we have gone past that particular incident.'
The increasingly hard tone adopted by the rebels was interpreted at
Westminster as a signal that they are determined to act as a separate group
within the Conservative party in the hope of forcing the prime minister to
negotiate. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary and a leading cabinet
Euro-sceptic, sought to play down the split, insisting there was 'no doubt
at all that we shall fight the next election as a united party'.
However, other ministers said Mr Major would not back down because of the
fear that an early reconciliation would be seen as weakness that would
prompt further indiscipline.
Conservative whips hope the government's unambitious legislative programme
for the remainder of the parliamentary session will deprive the rebels of
the opportunity of further revolts.
Mr Marlow's comments followed a blistering attack on Mr Major by Mr Michael
Carttiss, the MP for Great Yarmouth, who accused the prime minister of
abandoning manifesto commitments to curb European Union spending. In a
further embarrassment for ministers, Mr William Cash, the MP for Stafford,
in a letter to The Times, delivered a swingeing attack on the government's
handling of the rebellion.
Mr Cash, one of the most prominent Eurosceptics to have retained the Tory
whip, strongly defended the loyalty of the rebels and accused the government
of repeated errors.
Mr Jeremy Hanley, Conservative party chairman, accused the opposition of
'dirty tricks' after Labour released copies of a speech in which Mr Major
allegedly admitted to party workers the the government was 'at a low ebb'.
Labour later accepted Mr Hanley's assurance that the speech was a forgery.

FT  21 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
France's largest chemicals company keeps mutating. Its gradual exit from low
margin commodity chemicals continued with the sale of its FFr2bn acetics
operations. That followed the disposal of its TDI business earlier this
month. The disposals, combined with Rhone-Poulenc's strong cash flow,
suggest the group should meet its debt cutting targets next year.
The more comfortable debt burden should allow Rhone-Poulenc to sort out its
healthcare operations which have severe problems. Last week's US Food and
Drug Administration rejection of the cancer treatment Taxotere was a
disaster for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, its majority-owned subsidiary. The drug,
which should have generated sales of Dollars 300m by 1996, will not now be
launched in the US before 1997. Until then, that leaves RPR with a portfolio
of old drugs with strictly limited growth prospects. Last month's Gencell
initiative in gene therapy was strategically correct, but will not generate
any new products for five years. An obvious move for Rhone-Poulenc would be
to buy the 31 per cent of RPR that it does not own. This would enhance
earnings and would free Rhone-Poulenc to sell or merge the business.
Alternatively, it could raise equity, acquire another drugs company and
drive earnings growth through cost cutting. That is something RPR's
management is good at. Whatever happens, Rhone-Poulenc must deal with the
problems at RPR.

FT  21 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: De La Rue/Portals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Portals' shareholders may be disappointed its board failed to fight; a
contested takeover would probably have raised the final price paid by De La
Rue. But in an industry where customers are governments, and discretion is a
byword, the damage wreaked on both businesses during a hostile bid could
have been significant. Shareholders are being offered a fair price for a
fair business.
The rationale for combining De La Rue's printing expertise and Portals'
paper technology is impeccable. Governments are increasingly concerned about
counterfeit banknotes. De La Rue will be able to marry the two groups'
anti-fraud technologies, offering worried customers a comprehensive service.
Portals' paper distribution network will also help De La Rue market its high
denomination, high-margin banknotes to governments which are unwilling to
invest in expensive technology for low volume print runs. Finally, De La Rue
will be able to market verifying machines based on paper technology to
clearers and central banks.
Fears that De La Rue is deepening its exposure to paper money when a
cashless society is on the horizon are groundless. Use of cash is set to
expand rapidly in the developing world, while a cashless first world will
remain a pipe-dream in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, concerns
remain. De La Rue needs to allay fears that competing bank note
manufacturers will be unwilling to buy paper from its new subsidiary. Given
few opportunities for cost cutting, the group will also have to demonstrate
the synergies of putting the companies together are real. The acquisition is
sensible if not sensational.

FT  21 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors may be forgiven for experiencing a sense of deja vu: another year
is coming to an end and once again economists are expressing optimism about
prospects for the US dollar. The prognoses made this time last year proved
spectacularly wrong. Is history about to repeat itself?
The new optimism is triggered by the Federal Reserve's aggression on the
interest rate front: since short-term rates were raised by a higher than
expected 75 basis points on November 25, the dollar has risen sharply
against both the yen and the D-Mark. Notwithstanding the Fed's decision to
leave short-term rates unchanged yesterday, the expectation now is that
rates will rise again by February. Thereafter, dollar supporters contend,
the currency will be supported by a further tightening throughout the year.
This argument looks flawed on a number of counts. US rates have been rising
since February, but this did nothing to support the dollar. The currency was
undermined by an outflow of cash from bond markets, a pattern which could
repeat itself next year, the difference being that equities, rather than
Treasuries, look vulnerable this time round. The US still labours under a
large current account deficit, a deep-seated structural problem which
militates against strengthening of the dollar. A third reason for caution is
the likelihood that German interest rates will start to rise again from the
middle of next year. This will add to the attractions of the D-Mark at the
dollar's expense.

FT  21 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Costly miscalculations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel's offer to replace all its latest Pentium microprocessors is a
colossal embarrassment. Only a week ago, the world's largest semiconductor
manufacturer was vigorously disputing IBM's decision to withdraw shipments
of the micro chip due to a minor flaw. Now, it is offering free replacement
for all buyers of up to 6m systems containing the chip.
The stock market reaction to the volte-face is curious. Intel's share price
surged yesterday, adding Dollars 1bn to its market capitalisation. And yet
the replacement programme is likely to cost anywhere between Dollars 100m to
Dollars 500m, more than a snip even for a company expected to generate net
earnings of Dollars 2.6bn this year. Investors' nonchalance in part reflects
the financial strength of Intel, a group with around Dollars 4bn of net
cash. However, it has sunk credibility and cash into what was supposed to be
the world's most advanced mass produced micro chip. Some Dollars 1bn has
been spent on developing the chip, a further Dollars 150m invested in a
global advertising campaign to promote the brand. Sales were expected more
than to double in 1995. After putting this wave of bad publicity behind it,
Intel should still meet that target, as long as the replacement programme
leaves customers satisfied.
The share price reaction suggests that investors are giving Intel credit for
biting the bullet and undertaking a drastic, if humiliating, exercise in
damage limitation. But there must be concerns over their naivety in not
addressing the problem earlier, and saving both money and face.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Mexico devalues the peso amid deepening unrest in Chiapas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mexico's new government yesterday allowed a big devaluation of the peso in
the face of mounting outflows of capital, reversing a long-held policy
permitting only a gradual depreciation of the currency.
It is the first significant devaluation by Mexico since 1987. The move by
the government of President Ernesto Zedillo, who assumed office on December
1, followed 10 months of capital outflows from the country, which
intensified again over the past couple of weeks.
Government officials said they expected the peso would float upwards in
value early next year, as political tensions in the country began to ease.
Sales of Mexican assets by foreign investors reflected worries about
deepening political tensions in the southern state of Chiapas, analysts
said. Investors also had concerns about the size of the country's current
account deficit, which will amount to some Dollars 28bn (Pounds 18bn) this
year.
Armed rebels mounted an offensive in Chiapas in January, demanding more
rights for indigenous peoples and enhanced democracy. A tense impasse with
the military has continued and this week some rebels occupied the Chiapas
town of Simojovel and blocked roads around it. Several hundred government
troops, backed by two light tanks, were reported last night to be heading
for the town.
The peso closed yesterday at 3.996 to the dollar, 15 per cent down on
Monday's close. This follows a depreciation of some 10 per cent earlier in
the year.
The government announced that the permitted floor value of the peso would
drop to 4.0016 to the US dollar, compared with Monday's floor of 3.466. The
permitted daily slide, which amounts to some 4 per cent a year, will be
allowed to continue.
The Mexican stock market reacted favourably to the move, rising almost 6 per
cent in heavy trading before falling back to close 1.97 per cent up
following Monday's 4.2 per cent fall.
Mr Jaime Serra Puche, finance minister, said political pressure was the main
reason behind the devaluation. Analysts said a seasonal demand for dollars
by private companies, a switch by domestic investors from peso-denominated
government paper to dollar-denominated securities and a general pull-out of
Mexican stocks by foreign investors were also factors in the devaluation.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Berlusconi set to call early elections: Lira touches new low
as uncertainty mounts ahead of confidence vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister, is expected to press for
an early election even if he survives a parliamentary confidence vote this
week.
The strategy of the embattled media magnate turned politician was outlined
yesterday by Mr Giuliano Ferrara, the government spokesman and minister for
parliamentary affairs.
Mr Ferrara said the prime minister would have no option but to go to the
country if the rightwing coalition was deserted - as has been threatened -
by one of its members, the populist Northern League.
The heightening political tension and uncertainty was reflected in financial
markets yesterday, with the lira touching a new low of L1,050 against the
D-Mark.
Early elections would probably leave Italy with a caretaker government until
May, given the minimum 60 days between the dissolution of parliament and an
election, plus the subsequent formalities of forming a government.
Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader who has become Mr Berlusconi's chief
adversary, has presented one no-confidence motion in conjunction with the
Popular Party, the main centrist opposition party, for debate today. Another
two no-confidence motions have been tabled by leftwing groups.
However, yesterday Mr Ferrara indicated that Mr Berlusconi would try to
seize the initiative by presenting a confidence motion of his own. The aim
of this would be to show that the League had 'betrayed' the government at Mr
Bossi's bidding.
'If the vote goes against the government in the confidence motion, then
there would be no alternative but to seek early elections - and quickly,' Mr
Ferrara said.
By pushing for early elections, Mr Berlusconi believes he will be able to
capitalise on his own popularity and discredit the League for changing
sides.
Control of the media will be central to such a plan, and Mr Berlusconi on
Monday showed disregard for the normal rules of media access. He obliged
state and his own television channels to run a party political broadcast
that encouraged popular protest against the League. Mr Berlusconi is due to
open the debate this afternoon, the 1995 budget having been finally approved
by both houses of parliament.
Unlike a no-confidence vote, a confidence motion can be proposed at any
time. This could come at the end of a speech by Mr Berlusconi in which he is
likely to offer his resignation if he fails to retain the current majority.
'The government will resign tomorrow. A long election campaign begins
tomorrow,' predicted Mr Giuseppe Tatarella, deputy prime minister and the
senior member of the far right National Alliance in the five-party
government.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Turkish tangle
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The failure of the European Union to finalise its planned customs union with
Turkey this week was predictable. On the one hand, there is widespread
concern in western Europe at the present human rights situation in the
country. On the other, Greek opposition in principle to virtually all
gestures of partnership towards Turkey from the EU remains apparently
implacable. The first concern is justified. The second is
counter-productive, both for the EU and for Greece.
The relationship between Turkey and western Europe is of vital strategic
importance and, at the same time, extremely sensitive. The country sits at
the centre of a complex of three extraordinarily volatile areas: the
Balkans, the Caucasus and the Middle East. Its stability and its commitment
to democracy are essential to prevent the upheavals in those areas from
spreading and contaminating the entire region. Turkey's membership of Nato
and its association treaty with the EU have consistently proved helpful
guarantees of that stability.
Turkey wants very much to be considered a European state, and not an
outsider. Yet its application for full membership of the EU has hitherto
been rebuffed, both on economic grounds and because of its poor record on
human rights, above all in dealing with its Kurdish minority. On the other
hand, its association treaty, signed way back in 1963, commits both sides to
introducing a customs union by January 1 1996.
The trouble is that the human rights situation in Turkey has not noticeably
improved. The imprisonment of eight Kurdish members of parliament has
underlined the continuing problem, even if the threat of executing them for
treason has now been lifted. The European Parliament, and the EU member
states, are right to demand that the Turkish government and army should
respect the rule of law in their fight against terrorism.
Simply blocking the customs union is not going to help those in Turkey who
want to promote democracy and the rule of law. It will more probably
strengthen the hands of the hard liners. A combination of carrot and stick
is needed. But Greek intransigence results in a policy which is all stick.
It is not at all clear that Greece will lift its blockage by the next
meeting with Turkey, fixed for March. It has now been blocking proposed
financial co-operation for the past seven years. It means that Greece has
made itself the scapegoat for keeping Turkey out in the cold. It is a policy
which is counter-productive for all concerned.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Sanity on the roads
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government's transport planners have belatedly acknowledged that new
roads encourage people to travel more. But it would be the height of folly
for ministers to follow their new-found wisdom with a thoughtless attack on
the roads programme. Rather, the urgent priority is for the introduction of
road pricing, so that motorists and businesses pay a true economic cost for
their use of the road system.
A report published this week by the standing advisory committee on trunk
road assessment, a group of independent experts, concluded that road schemes
should take into account 'induced traffic'. Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport
secretary, has said he will accordingly reassess all 270 road schemes
currently at planning stage.
The report claims that, by neglecting induced traffic, transport officials
have long over-estimated the economic benefits of new roads and road
improvements. This is because new roads often serve simply to stimulate
extra traffic. Since much of the trunk road network is already close to
capacity, additional traffic leads immediately to increased congestion on
existing roads.
Anti-roads groups have seized on this acknowledgement of induced traffic as
evidence that too many roads are being built. They see it as a signal that
the roads programme should be drastically curtailed - and endlessly pray in
aid the M25, more congested after every improvement.
This is far too simplistic an approach. There can be no doubt that induced
traffic is often desirable. Regions - even towns - often suffer from an
inadequate road infrastructure. In principle, we should no more regret the
upgrading of roads than any other improvement in communications networks.
However, this is not an argument for expanding roads, regardless. On the
contrary, transport policy is in a parlous state, because individuals and
businesses are at the moment encouraged to make uneconomic choices in their
use of transport infrastructure. This will continue until motorists are
obliged to pay a price for the use of roads that reflects marginal social
cost. The government is working on proposals to introduce electronic tolling
on the motorways, which is unlikely, for technical reasons, to be possible
before 1998. It cannot come a moment too soon.
Motorway and city centre tolling could serve to price marginal journeys off
the strategic roads network at peak periods, reducing the overall capacity
needed and increasing the efficiency of its use. It would impose the
discipline on road travel that applies to other modes of transport.
In the process, it would almost certainly make public transport more
attractive - particularly such common sense projects as rapid transport
systems in congested urban areas. The government's announcement last week of
approval for local authority transport spending revealed a small but
potentially significant shift to measures to promote cycling, pedestrians
and buses.
Mr Mawhinney wishes to stimulate a public debate on transport policy. This
is to be welcomed. Unfortunately, the transport debate is currently
polarised between the anti-roads lobby and supporters of more road building.
The debate needs to focus on allowing efficient choices, not on modes of
transport considered desirable a priori.
The defect of this report is that the issue it focuses on is a red herring.
It should hardly need saying that additional roads induce extra traffic.
That is what transport infrastructure is for. If the UK is to have a
sensible debate, it cannot start from here.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Soap and chips
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However else it may be remembered, 1994 will probably go down as the year
the gloves came off in international business. VW and GM at loggerheads over
an itinerant purchasing director; Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble slugging it
out in the European detergents market; now Intel and IBM are at each other's
throats over alleged flaws in Intel's Pentium personal computer chip.
At one level these battles have little in common, beyond the obvious fact
that markets for goods and services are getting fiercer, as they become
global. But the year's two great marketing struggles - the 'soap war' over
Unilever's Power detergent, and the dispute between Intel and IBM - do offer
other, broader lessons.
One is that global marketing is uniquely challenging. Launching a product
more or less simultaneously across a continent, or the world, as is
increasingly the trend in consumer markets, demands that companies attain a
flexibility and focus that few have yet achieved. If something goes wrong in
one national market, the chances are that the problem will spread rapidly -
as Unilever, recently reorganised along continental lines, found to its
cost.
Another lesson is that technology can be a marketing curse as well as a
blessing. Companies seize on technological innovations as a unique selling
point for products, especially in mature, oligopolistic markets, such as
European detergents. Yet unless they subject their new products to the most
rigorous testing - looking, as Unilever patently did not in the case of
Power detergents, for flaws that a ruthless competitor might expose - the
invention may blow up in their faces.
Then there is the question of communications. Both Unilever and P&amp;G have
learned in recent months that they can no longer hide behind the carefully
manipulated image of their brands; they have to explain themselves and their
activities more effectively to consumers and the wider public.
Even where technology is the only obvious selling point, as with Pentium
chips, there is a risk that over-ambitious marketing claims, without
adequate information, will simply confuse the consumer. How many PC users
had worried about possible flaws in the inner workings of their computers
until Intel started trumpeting Pentium? How many users of soap powder
noticed that washing damaged their clothes before Power came along?
It does not matter how mundane the product. Consumers are more demanding
than ever before - and competitors more ruthless. The manufacturer that
fails to appreciate these facts will go to the wall.

FT  21 DEC 94 / A crisis of leadership: Roger Matthews analyses the
difficulties Middle Eastern governments face in attaining peace and
prosperity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peace, if it comes fully, and lower oil revenues, if they persist, could
pose as big a political challenge to Middle East governments over the next
few years as wars and sudden wealth have done during the previous 40.
The reaction of the regimes most critically affected by these developments
will influence not just the well-being of the peoples in the region, but
also the continued security of western oil supplies.
War, or the threat of it, has long been used to justify and legitimise
authoritarian governments throughout the region. The paternalistic
dispensation of vast oil revenues serves a similar function. So long as
there was a dangerous enemy without, and expensive oil below, the popular
demand for change was likely to remain muted.
Neither revenues nor threats of war can now be guaranteed. The enemy, in the
shape of Israel, cannot be realistically challenged on the battlefield. Oil,
though still plentiful, is not worth what it was, and revenues are no longer
sufficient to ensure a pliant population.
Peace, in so far as it has been achieved, has been between leaderships
motivated primarily by the desire to retain power, and has created little of
the warmth between peoples that would make the agreements more durable. The
Israeli-Egypt agreement signed in 1979 has done almost nothing to stimulate
exchanges, economic or cultural, between the two countries.
In part this reflects Egyptian resentment at Israel's continued occupation
of Arab territory and its perceived arrogance towards those living under its
control.
The outline accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation
and the subsequent treaty with Jordan have also failed to ignite popular
enthusiasm, for very similar reasons.
As a result, Mr Yassir Arafat's leadership of the PLO is under mounting
assault for its failure to deliver tangible material improvements for the
vast majority of impoverished Palestinians, and for his refusal to consult
and delegate more widely.
But Mr Arafat is simultaneously at the mercy of an Israeli government, which
under Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, is obsessed by short-term
security considerations. To this end, Mr Rabin has made Israeli military
withdrawal from the West Bank conditional on the degree to which Mr Arafat
can halt attacks on Israelis by Hamas and other extremist Islamic groups.
Small wonder then that Mr Arafat's opponents, and particularly Hamas, accuse
him of acting as a surrogate for the Israeli army.
The Hamas accusation appeared to be given greater credence last month when
13 protesting Palestinians were shot and killed by Mr Arafat's police. There
is nothing novel about Palestinians fighting among themselves in the
diaspora, but the threat of wider armed conflict erupting in the
newly-liberated territories is a serious setback to national aspirations.
For decades, Palestinians had boasted that when their new state was born it
would be modern, democratic and efficient - a reflection of their individual
commitment to educational achievement and to their managerial expertise
demonstrated throughout the Arab world, and especially in the Gulf.
Palestine, they claimed, would not be like other Arab states.
So far little has been seen to support that assertion. The most articulate
voices of people such as Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman during earlier
rounds of negotiations with Israel, and Mr Haidar Abdel Shafi, arguably the
most respected leader in Gaza, have been largely stilled.
The younger generation of internationally-trained Palestinians has scarcely
been encouraged to participate. Instead Mr Arafat prefers to rely on the
same, narrow coterie of men who are without popular appeal, but offer no
serious challenge to him.
Elections to local and national self-rule authorities might just inject some
new blood into the senior ranks of the leadership. But polls have been
seriously delayed, and remain tied to Mr Rabin's assessment of whether
Israeli security can be guaranteed after a military withdrawal. But the
longer the delay continues, the more Palestinian resentment will grow at the
failures of the peace accord, and the greater will be the chances of
elections producing a significant protest vote that will please neither Mr
Rabin nor Mr Arafat.
This crisis in leadership is repeated in different forms throughout the
Middle East.
The most extreme example is Algeria, where the inability of the
post-independence regime to answer the basic needs of its population
provoked a panic rush for legitimacy through the ballot box, and an equally
abrupt retreat in early 1992 when the Islamic opposition seemed certain to
win. As a result the country has plunged into near civil war, with an
estimated 700 people dying every week.
Both sides are employing the most brutal methods in their battle for
ascendancy. Helplessly squeezed between the two extremes are the vast
majority of Algerians who wish for nothing more than responsive, caring
government.
Their plight is that of so many Middle Easterners, whose governments have
looked at the ill-managed flirtation with democracy in Algeria and concluded
that they will have no truck with such dangerous adventures. Instinctively
hostile to democracy, they have encouraged belief in the myth of a
co-ordinated, international campaign by the political wing of Islam to
overthrow established, western-oriented governments. It is a convenient
argument, sometimes supported by Iranian government actions, but ignores the
fact that Islamic forces have fared best where governments have done worst.
Egypt, historically the most stable of Arab nations, appears to have at
least temporarily blunted Islamic violence, but its efforts to reduce the
poverty in which extremism breeds remain modest. The government has no mass
political movement to support it, and the majority of people feel incapable
of influencing its actions. So when challenged, its response tends to be
one-dimensional, based primarily on police and military action that carries
with it the risk of further alienating parts of the population.
Neither has 15 years of peace with Israel and more than Dollars 2bn a year
in annual aid brought significant economic gains to more than a few
Egyptians. Greater fiscal stability has been achieved, but the vast and
inefficient public sector still dominates the economy and the privatisation
programme is moving ahead at a snail's pace. A broader peace with Israel
involving more Arab neighbours may bring wider economic benefits, but the
Egyptian example is far from compelling.
If peace is to be extended, it will require a deal with the Syrian regime,
which is more authoritarian than Egypt, has dealt more emphatically with its
Islamic opponents, imposes an even greater state domination of the economy,
and is the controlling influence over events in Lebanon. President Hafez
al-Assad may be moving into the twilight of his career but he is no less
determined to win back the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, and
appears unlikely to make any political or significant economic reforms that
would undermine his ability to dictate the succession. Mr Assad appears to
have convinced President Bill Clinton that he has made a strategic choice
for peace, but it will only be on terms that satisfy his domestic
requirements.
Yet just as such a peace would eventually erode the justification for
authoritarian government in Syria, so lower oil revenues will slowly nibble
away at the political fabric of regimes in the Gulf. The governments of the
six members of the Gulf Co-operation Council, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman,
United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain, are all faced by the same budget
deficit problem. Either they have to slash spending, or find extra sources
of income.
Saudi Arabia this year has sought to cut official expenditure by 20 per
cent, but even if it has been successful the budget deficit is still likely
to be close to 10 per cent of gross national product. There is still plenty
of fat to trim, but not without causing pain to a population that has grown
accustomed to a lifestyle largely funded by government.
Getting less from government is, however, one thing. Contributing to
government, through the payment of taxes, is something else. Time and again
Saudi officials have warned privately that the introduction of such measures
is not compatible with social harmony, meaning that the ruling House of Saud
continues to set its face against significant change.
Such unwillingness to adapt mattered less while Saudi Arabia was cushioned
by substantial financial reserves. But these were massively eroded by the
Dollars 55bn cost of financing the Gulf war, and the kingdom is now being
asked, albeit far more modestly, to contribute to the latest US deployment
in October, when Iraq again appeared to be threatening Kuwait. Should
further allied deployments be necessary, or another crisis flare in the
Gulf, Saudi Arabia would be left with little room for financial manoeuvre.
The kingdom might be more relaxed about the future if it were not for the
continuing uncertainty about the intentions of Iran and Iraq, its two
largest and still potentially hostile neighbours. Iran's religious leaders
appear to be maintaining their grip on power, but the heavy burden of
external debt and more general mismanagement of the economy is forcing up
both inflation and unemployment. Further outbreaks of social unrest appear
likely and, while the reaction of the regime domestically is predictable,
there is much less certainty about how it might seek to divert attention
through its activities on the international stage.
No person has played the diversionary card more persistently that President
Saddam Hussein, and no people has suffered from it more devastingly than
those of Iraq. How, or when, they might emerge from the tyranny is as
unpredictable as the behaviour of the Baghdad leadership, but the US appears
determined not to accept any significant easing of sanctions while Mr
Hussein remains in power.
The US policy of 'dual containment' may limit the threat that Iraq and Iran
can mount in the short term against their neighbours. But the longer-term
effects on the political attitudes of a combined population of 80m people,
fed on a constant diet of anti-American propaganda, should give pause for
thought in Washington.
What is missing most obviously in the Middle East is a role model. Some
western fingers point approvingly at Morocco and Tunisia as two countries
that have instigated market-oriented reforms and might be willing to
contemplate a more liberal political system sometime in the future. Lebanon
is trying to rebuild, but its prospects remain hostage to events outside its
borders. Jordan also might grow quickly if peace deepens and Iraq.
But for all the glimmers of hope, there is also Libya, where Col Muammar
Gaddafi still holds sway, Yemen recently battered by civil war, and Sudan
torn between civil strife and the grip of an Islamic regime. The collapse of
the Soviet Union has helped to accelerate the decline of such regimes, and
the collapse of any semblance of Arab unity has underlined their
international isolation.
Peace between Israel and Arab governments might just provide the catalyst
for positive realignments if it moved more swiftly, was approached in a more
generous spirit, and developed a momentum that delivered early economic
gains. Many businessmen attending the recent Casablanca conference on the
economic benefits of peace were encouraged by the contacts they had made and
impressed by the ease with which barriers came down. Such flexibility has
yet to translate itself to the political negotiating table.
It may be, of course, that there is no majority in Israel for a peace that
would return virtually all occupied Arab land and see the removal of most of
the Jewish settlements. If it is too late politically for Israel, then it
may also be too late for many Arab leaders to accept anything less, and
survive.
Mr Arafat could well be the touchstone. He and Mr Rabin must be well aware
that if they fail to carry the day, the centre crumbles, and the challenge
of peace will never have been fully joined.
That, for the most myopic and the most extreme, will be a relief.

At least one person has not been carried away by the growth of Direct Line,
the UK telephone insurer. The firm's annual report confirms that Peter Wood,
its intense chief executive, was paid Pounds 17.3m this year. But the
emoluments of Direct Line's chairman are not so grand. In fact, George
Mathewson was paid nothing last year. Perhaps Mathewson, chief executive of
Royal Bank of Scotland, Direct Line's parent, is content with the Pounds
401,000 he got for his main job. Or perhaps he is making a point to his
ambitious junior colleague.

Scotland's Celtic is the latest football club to tread the road to the stock
market. Yesterday it announced a plan to raise up to Pounds 9.4m and
disclosed that a group headed by Dermot Desmond, former chairman of Dublin's
NCB Stockbrokers, intends to become a significant shareholder in the
106-year-old club. Fans are also being offered a first chance to buy a stake
in the club for as little as Pounds 7.77 per week.
But the deal failed to impress Celtic's oldest supporter - the Bank of
Scotland. After a century-long association, Celtic has dropped the Bank of
Scotland and switched its favours to Manchester's Co-operative Bank. Celtic
chairman Fergus McCann says the level of support required by Celtic was not
forthcoming from Scotland's oldest bank.

In what possible circumstances would the UK government keep quiet until
after last week's calamitous Dudley by-election the little fact that
100-plus jobs would be moving in the direction of the west Midlands
constituency?
For the Department of Social Security left it until yesterday to reveal that
the headquarters of the Child Support Agency would be moving from London to
Dudley - presumably with consequent positive, if modest, effects on the
unemployment register.
So does this signify a sudden bout of high ethical standards with regard to
buying voters' support? The DSS says it would indeed have made the
announcement earlier 'but for the by-election'. More likely explanation:
acute awareness of the agency's dismal reputation.

Simon Keswick, Trafalgar House's new taipan, really must do his homework.
Having made a hostile takeover bid for Newcastle's Northern Electric, the
next move in his battle plan required him and his NCOs to enter enemy
territory disguised as a local company.
So yesterday saw Trafalgar's top brass having their photographs taken in
front of the Tyne's bridges. Not only does Trafalgar House own 14 companies
in the North East but one subsidiary is connected with three of the six
bridges over the River Tyne. Two were built by Darlington-based Cleveland
Structural Engineering and the most famous of them all, the Tyne Bridge, was
erected by Dorman Long, acquired by Trafalgar House in 1982 and then
combined with Cleveland.
'Wherever we go we feel you have got to be sensitive about people's
culture,' says Keswick. How sad then that Trafalgar House's propaganda could
not even get the dates right for the construction of Newcastle's most famous
bridge. It was built between 1925 and 1929, not in 1920.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Observer: Brothers sweet for Rolo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As the endgame for control of Credito Romagnolo unfolds this week, it is a
matter of so far so good for the Bolognese regional bank in its rather
eccentric decision to hire both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as
co-advisers.
What started off as a hostile move on the part of Credito Italiano, placing
a value of L2,000bn on 48.2 per cent of Rolo, has now been raised to a
possible L3,290bn for 70 per cent from a Cariplo-led consortium, an
infinitely preferable proposition.
The two great rivals of global M&amp;A turn out to be happy families in more
ways than one. Meet the Zaoui brothers - Michael, the elder, managing
director in charge of M&amp;A for Morgan Stanley in southern Europe, and Yoel,
four years his junior, an executive director at Goldman Sachs.
The pair, who have been co-operating on an often parochial defence revolving
around Rolo's regional identity, could themselves hardly be more
international. Sporting a north African name, the brothers grew up in Italy,
went to business schools in the US and are French nationals.
Michael has enjoyed the opportunity to 'get closer' to Yoel, and admits to
having dispensed the odd tip along the way. Makes a change. In global
advisory work, it is usually Goldman Sachs that plays the big brother.

<TEXT>
Sir, In your December 3/4 issue there are two articles, two studies in
contrast, which make me doubly happy that we had our Boston Tea Party in the
1770s and sent you packing to your sweet King George. One is 'Drug claim on
Gibraltar border' and the other 'It is China that will call the shots on the
handover of Hong Kong'.
I understand the power of 1bn Chinese buying Jaguars or Raleigh bicycles,
but you are handing 5m British subjects to a communistic totalitarian
country while you refuse to return Gibraltar to Spain, a friendly,
democratic country.
Gibraltar is a colonial relic, a historical rancour of England over Spain,
and, for 40m Spaniards, it is a source of irritation and contraband, an
ingrown toe nail in the foot of Spain.
Here is my idea and wishes for the English millennium: that England, in its
heart, makes peace with Spain, buries the war axe and returns Gibraltar to
Spain; that a statue of Queen Elizabeth II and of King Juan Carlos I be set
up on Punta Europa.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MIKE PARKER and Mr JOHN SURREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recent public relations furore over the affairs of British Gas
should not be allowed to divert attention away from the much more important
long-term issues arising from the proposed introduction of full competition
in the domestic gas market. The recent report on this issue by the trade and
industry select committee came to conclusions on prices and security of
supply which are closely in line with the analysis in our recent study, UK
Gas Policy: Regulated Monopoly or Managed Competition?
On prices, we said that competition is unlikely to result in significant
reductions in the average domestic price of gas over and above the effect of
the retail price index-4 price formula already applied to British Gas; and
the select committee acknowledges that the extent of any price reductions
attributable to the introduction of competition 'remains highly uncertain'.
We also concluded that, under competition, it will be difficult to maintain
the present level of gas supply security and the select committee agrees 'it
will be less easy for new competitors to match supply and demand, given
their smaller size and the reduced ability to forecast demand in a
competitive market'.
It was primarily these considerations which led us to the view that the
overall balance of benefits, costs and risks was unfavourable. The select
committee, using the same data and similar analysis does not come to that
judgment and the issue remains unresolved.
Much of the discussion has been polarised into one of 'for or against
competition'. This is misguided. In appropriate circumstances, competition
can bring great benefits. But in the case of domestic gas, we remain to be
convinced that there is an overall balance of advantage. Mike Parker,

FT  21 DEC 94 / Toys make children of us all: Vanessa Houlder on the gadgets
and products that excited or seduced consumers this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hit product of 1994 caused hype and havoc in equal measure. The shortage
of the plastic action toys called Mighty Morphin Power Rangers led to
overnight queues, waiting lists months long, a thriving black market, fights
in toy shops and even an armed robbery.
The demand for these toys, which are based on a TV series being screened in
80 countries, is on target to beat all previous records for toy sales in the
run-up to Christmas.
The output of 33 factories across the world working 24 hours a day, seven
days a week, evidently left large numbers of unsatisfied customers around
the world. 'It could sell 10 times over if the stock were available,' claims
Bandai, the manufacturers.
It is no surprise that product crazes most often occur in the toy industry.
Television's power to sell toys based on popular programmes, together with
children's susceptibility to peer pressure and their skill at pressurising
their parents, can create a mass market for a new product overnight.
Selling toys aimed at adults is a trickier proposition, although there is no
shortage of companies willing to try. The Christmas catalogue of Neiman
Marcus, the elite Texas-based department store, offered customers a novel
method of observing fish and coral with its Dollars 7,500 Bellaqua Breathing
Observation Bubble (Bob), an underwater scooter with an air-filled dome to
cover its rider's head and shoulders.
Another ingenious, if less elaborate, viewing gadget made a big inroad in
the UK. The Night Spy, a Pounds 495 image intensifier that allows wildlife
spotters, astronomers and caving enthusiasts to see in the dark was the
best-selling product of Innovations, a UK catalogue company.
On a more practical level, some of the most fashionable gadgets of 1994 have
been communication tools, which have benefited from falling costs and
increased sophistication. In France, the Bi-Bop mobile phone, which is small
enough to slip into a pocket, became an ultra-chic accessory for Parisians,
following its launch last year. In California, pocket pagers continued to be
essential items for teenagers.
For techno-enthusiasts, one of the most promising new developments in the
personal communications market was the arrival of Sony's Magic Link in
September. It is a small, light personal digital assistant that organises
contacts and calendar and allows users to communicate easily via voice, fax
and e-mail.
Another personal digital assistant, Sharp's Zaurus, a pen-based system that
reads handwriting took the Japanese market by storm. Other top-selling
gadgets in Japan were wide-screen television sets and car navigational
devices based on global positioning systems.
In general, however, the tastes of Japanese consumers are moving away from
the technological sophistication of recent years. Dentsu, Japan's largest
advertising agency, detected a widespread craving for familiarity and
nostalgia this year in its annual survey of hit products.
Wrinkle-free shirts, made from a fabric that retains its original shape, was
a hit product that was a variation on a familiar theme. Another measure of a
more downbeat mood among Japanese consumers was the popularity of books
about dying. Peaceful Death, by radio commentator Rokusuke Ei, the most
popular of these books, sold more than 1m copies.
Value for money was a strong theme with Japanese consumers this year. The
extravagance that characterised the late 1980s, when people exchanged
splendid gifts such as live lobsters, has not yet returned. However,
Japanese consumers were slightly more prepared to buy luxuries in 1994 than
they were in 1993, according to Dentsu.
Indeed, luxury goods have made a partial comeback throughout the affluent
world, following the downturn of the early 1990s. At one point this year,
Louis Vuitton said that demand for its range of bags was so strong that its
luggage shop on Avenue Montaigne in Paris limited sales to two per customer.
Moreover, demand for luxury goods has been strong in markets that were,
until recently, closed to western retailers. Boutiques such as Cartier's in
Shanghai, Christian Dior's in Moscow, and Ferrari's showroom in Beijing have
allowed status conscious entrepreneurs to flaunt their new wealth.
The spirits manufacturers have also found new markets. Imported vodka has
found a surprisingly buoyant market in Russia, while brandy - and, to a
lesser extent Scotch whisky - has sold strongly in China.
On the other side of the world, the most intriguing development in the
drinks market was the growing popularity of 'New Age' or 'natural'
beverages. These concoctions, which boast names such as Raspberry Iced Tea,
Amazin' Grape Juice, Mango Madness Cocktail, Raspberry Psychic Lemonade and
Grape Beyond took the US by storm, helping to erode the market share of
dominant cola drinks such as Coca-Cola.
The challenges facing one of the US's all-time greatest drink brands is
among the most intriguing product stories of recent years. But for the most
important US product trend of 1994, it is necessary to look to the computer
market.
In the US, where consumers are already several times more likely to possess
a home computer than in Europe or Japan, sales are growing at a pace that
will see nearly half of US households owning a PC by 1998.
This trend has been pushed forward this year by developments in multimedia.
The arrival of machines that can talk, sing, play music and show video clips
is creating new forms of electronic recreation, from 'infotainment' (such as
Microsoft's Encarta, a CD-RoM encyclopaedia) to disc-based games that can be
run on PCs.
In the face of this competition, traditional game manufacturers, such as
Sega, are fighting back with the first of a new generation of powerful
32-bit, compact disc-based machines. Sony sold out of its first video game
machine, the Sony Playstation, on its first day on the market in Japan.
As consumers wait for the new machines, enthusiasm for the existing 16-bit
video game platforms has waned. For the first time in five years, Nintendo
did not figure on the list of predicted top 10 Christmas best-selling toys
produced by Hamleys, the London toy store.
Nonetheless, the existing platforms have their uses. Sega has launched a
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers game for its Mega Drive and GameGear. It might
 -just might - help fob off the clamorous children whose parents failed to
get hold of one of the prized Power Rangers toys.

FT  21 DEC 94 / A very Bosnian plight: New nations still have to prove
themselves in trial by battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An anniversary passed last week with little notice and less celebration. On
December 16, 1991, the member states of the European Community (the European
Union did not yet exist) agreed on criteria by which requests for
recognition from new states would be judged. Everyone knew that these would
be used to accord recognition to Croatia and Slovenia, because that was what
the Germans wanted. But they were supposed to be applied to other former
constituent republics of the Yugoslav federation as well, and to those of
the Soviet Union which was also breaking up just then.
Recognition of new states in former Yugoslavia was hotly debated, because
the Serbs opposed it. Recognition of the ex-Soviet republics, by contrast,
was uncontroversial, as by then Russia was pushing for it. Little attention
was paid to the fact that Russia was itself a federation. There was no
debate on the desirability of applying the same principles to constituent
republics of that federation, should any request recognition.
Probably few of the ministers who set the criteria had heard of Chechnya,
let alone knew it had declared its independence six weeks earlier. If they
did know, their position was what it has remained: Chechnya was not their
business. It was an internal Russian matter, though one they hoped would be
solved without violence. The borders of the new states should remain as they
had been within the old federations of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union,
unless changed by mutual agreement.
If someone had asked why what applied to one federation should not apply to
another, the ministers would perhaps have said that Russia was not a 'real'
federation. Yet the Soviet Union had not been very 'real', either. In fact
it had been a highly centralised state, ruled from Moscow by a single
communist party.
That party had decided quite arbitrarily to give some regions the status of
Soviet republics, nominally equal to Russia, while making others mere
'autonomous republics' or 'autonomous provinces' within Russia, or within
one of the other Soviet republics. (Thus the autonomous republic of Abkhazia
and province of South Ossetia found themselves in Georgia, which abolished
their autonomy when it achieved its own sovereignty.)
Equally arbitrary were the boundaries of these various units. The peoples of
the north Caucasus, in particular, were divided, reshuffled, deported and
repatriated at the whim of Stalin and his successors. All this is very
clearly and carefully explained in an extraordinarily well-timed report
published last week by the Minority Rights Group*; and described in a
livelier, more impressionistic way by Suzanne Goldenberg in her book Pride
of Small Nations (Zed Books, Pounds 14.95pb, Pounds 39.95hb).
Some were given territorial units, some not; sometimes two peoples with
unrelated languages were lumped together. Seldom did the 'titular
nationality' form a majority of the inhabitants in the territory named after
it. Several peoples were deported en masse to central Asia during the second
world war, then allowed to return years later, giving rise to vicious
territorial disputes.
'It is of paramount importance,' say the MRG authors piously, 'for the
European and international community not to neglect the needs of the region
and its peoples.' Some hope] Western leaders find it simpler to close their
eyes and hope Yeltsin gets on with it.
Many of them were not sure even in 1991 that recognising new states was such
a good idea, and others have regretted it. Recognition may have helped bring
about a ceasefire in Croatia, but it led more or less directly to war in
Bosnia. It has certainly not prevented bloodshed all along the southern
periphery of Russia, from Moldova to Tajikistan.
Among the criteria for recognition set by the European ministers, one that
previous generations of diplomats would have seen as the most important was
strangely left out: what the Slovenian jurist Danilo Turk calls 'the
criterion of the effectiveness of the power of the group claiming
self-determination in a certain territory'. Historically, states have
established themselves by proving, if necessary in war, that they were able
to survive; or they have been established after someone else defeated the
state to which their territory formerly belonged.
The ministers in Brussels, in December 1991, rightly sensed that such a
method of deciding whether a new state has the right to exist is barbaric
and primitive. They wanted to establish a more civilised and democratic test
of legitimacy. Did the majority of the people in the territory concerned
support the new state? And were dissenting minorities guaranteed full civil
and political rights within it? If so, it was entitled to recognition. What
they failed to consider was how to give effect to such legitimacy if the
group claiming self-determination does not effectively control its
territory, as proved the case in Bosnia.
Following the criteria they had established, the EC member states,
accompanied and urged on by the US, recognised Bosnia's independence in
April 1992; it was admitted to the UN the following month. But they were
unable or unwilling to help the new state to achieve effective control of
its own territory. Bosnia was left to face the same ordeal by battle that
other new states have had to pass, without being allowed weapons to fight
with.
Now the Chechens are in a similar plight. At least they, unlike the
Bosnians, cannot blame 'the international community' for encouraging them in
any false hopes.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Private pensions are no better
safeguard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof WILLEM H BUITER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his reflections on a World Bank study of the looming public pensions
crisis, Martin Wolf (Economic Eye: 'Confronting the old age crisis',
December 19) concludes that 'governments are absolutely certain to default
on their pension obligations, probably by a mixture of higher pension ages,
reduced indexation and means testing. The notion that the state can be
trusted is just one of several myths punctured by the Bank'.
He also refers to the Bank's recommendation of a multi-pillar system in
which the public pillar is supplemented by a privately-managed, funded and
mandatory system, alongside purely voluntary savings. He ends his column
with: '. . .Stop believing in Father Christmas and start saving now.'
Martin Wolf may have stopped believing in Father Christmas, but he appears
to have kept his faith in the Easter Bunny. If the state is not to be
trusted, why recommend privately managed, funded and mandatory pension
schemes or even purely voluntary savings? These kitties, too, can be (and
have been) raided by the state, without any need for recourse to such coarse
mechanisms as outright expropriation or confiscation.
The assets owned by private funds or individual savers can be raided through
targeted capital levies or a general wealth tax. The income earned on these
assets can be taxed in a variety of ways ('unearned' income used to be taxed
significantly more severely than labour income in the UK until quite
recently) and the consumption financed out of the earnings from these assets
can in turn be taxed with a wide range of general or specific instruments.
There is a rule of thumb in economic policy reform that says: if you are
faced with market failure, deal with it not by tinkering with the symptoms,
but by eliminating the root causes of that failure.
The same applies to the political system failure diagnosed by Wolf. If the
political system is fundamentally flawed in that it does not enable
governments to enter into binding commitments ('the state is not to be
trusted'), then reform the constitution so as to make it prohibitively
difficult or costly for governments to renege on certain classes of
commitments.
In the case under consideration, this might be achieved in part by requiring
heavily qualified majorities for changes in tax and benefit systems. Without
such reform Wolf's recommendations amount to saving future pensioners from
the guillotine by handing them to the firing squad.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Scheme designed for long-term
unemployed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN ATKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While your paper's interest in the worsening problem of very long-term
unemployment is to be applauded, your report of our institute's evaluation
of the pilot Workstart schemes is misleading ('Work scheme misses short-term
jobless', December 16). The Workstart pilots were explicitly designed to
help the very long-term unemployed back into jobs. It is therefore hardly
surprising that the pilots 'miss the short-term jobless', as your headline
states. Workstart has never sought to help the short-term unemployed, and
they are specifically excluded from its ambit.
Furthermore, your report states that 'just under half of the employers who
participated in the scheme . . . hired a long-term unemployed person, where
they would previously have recruited someone out of work for less than two
years'. This is not so. Our research found that, in the absence of a
subsidy, just under half of these employers would have hired someone other
than the very long-term unemployed, that is including, but not exclusively,
the short-term unemployed. The correct figure for the short-term unemployed
is 22 per cent.
What is needed now is to ensure that the new generation of Workstart-like
initiatives announced in the Budget learn the lessons of the pilot schemes.
Your report does not help this much.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Arts: This 'Nutcracker' has true magic - Clement Crisp, to
his surprise, enjoys a schools matinee in Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The time is 1.59 pm 'Only a minute to go, Miss' says an urgent infant voice
to its teacher. The house-lights go down. A buzz and twitter as of a million
birds fills the theatre. The first notes of the overture - not the most
boisterous of musical beginnings - and the house is hushed. The Birmingham
Royal Ballet is giving a schools matinee in its home theatre on Thursday
afternoon, and the red and gold disease, that most welcome of childhood
ailments, infects the whole assembly, as the young succumb to the magic of
the theatre.
And, surrounded by an infant horde to whet the appetite of a Herod, I
enjoyed The Nutcracker - which I had scarcely expected to do under these
circumstances - and equally enjoyed the children's response to the
production. There could be no better introduction for newcomers to ballet,
or the theatre. Sir Peter Wright's staging is a joy. It has true magic,
lively action, clever (but not too clever) ideas - Clara as a young dancer;
Drosselmeyer as a conjuror - and splendid designs by John Macfarlane that
provide their own magic and excitement. Best of all this staging conveys a
sense of wonder, about the tale itself and about the fact of being in a
theatre.
This is in part owed to Wright's feeling for the score. At its finest, and
it is at its finest throughout Act 1 and much of Act 2, Tchaikovsky's genius
finds sublime ways to suggest the enchantments of childhood and the
nostalgia an adult feels for them. There is tenderness and sadness in the
music, which speak very clearly in the adagio that precedes the Snow scene,
and in the great pas de deux. The party and the mouse-battle find the
composer writing at his most brilliant, and underlying the score is a thread
of melancholy. Wright shows us these matters without undue emphasis; like
the music, his staging touches lightly on profound feeling.
The score sounded well with BRB's orchestra under Anthony Twiner, and the
young listened and watched with attention and a huge responsiveness. They
gasped at Joseph Cipolla's sleight of hand as his Drosselmeyer pulled off
trick after trick - it is a fine reading. They thrilled on in-drawn breath
to the grand transformation of the Christmas tree. They were held by the
mouse-battle (here an elite corps of super-rats fighting a losing campaign).
They cheered each number on that via crucis of dance tedium which is the
second act divertissement, laughing at the Chinese dance (the best thing one
can do to this ancient bore) and clapping along with the trepak - a Russian
dance - maintaining strict tempo. The production, which is an unfailing
delight even to as hardened a Nutcracker-lag as I now am, puts not a foot
wrong for newcomers. And the tots gave fullest voice in appreciation of
Sandra Madgwick and Peter Boal, the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Prince.
Miss Madgwick was delightful. The dance was serene, her manner was radiant,
the delicious ring of the celeste was deliciously matched in her steps.
Peter Boal, a guest from New York City Ballet, is a true danseur noble, and
he brought an easy dignity and impeccable technical manners - sure phrasing;
clean bravura - to the demands of variation and coda.
Everything about the afternoon was at its best, and the children told the
dancers just how well-worthwhile such matinees are. BRB's artists play the
piece with great warmth and charm. The Nutcracker should be a part of every
child's memories: how good that Thursday's audience will have such a golden
performance to treasure.
Birmingham Royal Ballet brings the staging to the London Coliseum from
December 22 until January 7.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Arts: For dedicated followers of fashion - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors are obviously keen on the prospects for the new television
transmission systems: the flotation last week of BSkyB, Britain's leading
satellite operation, was over-subscribed. The company (in which Pearson,
owner of the Financial Times, has a stake) was, until quite recently, losing
large sums of money and now has a market value of Pounds 4.4bn. Many people,
it seems, have faith in the profitability of satellite systems, even if
their share of the business remains relatively small. That confidence rests,
presumably, on the realisation that subscription, and eventually
pay-per-view, services can make a lot of money at the margins even if
satellite and cable operators attract only a minority of the population.
So far satellite and cable remain irrelevant to the great majority of
British viewers. Most homes continue to have access only to the four
terrestrial networks. Between them those four (BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel
4) conceded only one per cent more of their audience share to the new boys
in 1994, slipping from a 94 per cent share to 93 per cent, just as they
slipped from 95 to 94 per cent in 1993. Thus all the dozens of satellite and
cable channels combined are still managing to win only a seven per cent
share of the audience. In terms of programme influence the small size of
that fraction could be unimportant if the cable and satellite companies were
innovators or setters of benchmarks; Le Gavroche sells far fewer lunches
than McDonald's but there seems little doubt about which is gastronomically
more interesting.
In television, however the opposite is true: the smaller, 'specialist'
suppliers, satellite and cable, provide programmes which (leaving aside
sport and movies, and considering the material actually made by television)
are cheap, derivative, and inferior to what you find on the terrestrial
networks, albeit arranged differently. Indeed, vast quantities of satellite
time are filled with old programmes bought from the stockpiles of the
terrestrials. There is just one exception, one satellite network which
wields an influence far greater than its viewing figures in Britain would
suggest: the music network, Music Television. MTV has become for the 1990s
what the colour supplement was to the 1960s, the setter of trends and
arbiter of fashions. If you see something new and bizarre in street culture,
pop music, or yoof television, odds are that it turned up first on MTV.
Moreover the influence is not merely on teenagers: check any office in the
media industries - advertising, facilities houses, independent television
companies - where a television is kept on all day and you will find that
most are tuned to MTV.
It is unlike any other network on television or radio. Other networks strain
to ensure that you know when one programme ends and another begins; loud
signature tunes call you from the kitchen, expensive credit sequences make
urgent visual signals to mark the junctions. At MTV, while there is no lack
of expertise in the graphics department (in fact their logos are some of the
best anywhere, as good as those of Globo Brazil, world beaters in this
category in the 1980s - watching 15 minutes of MTV logos would be more
entertaining than most 'entertainment' programmes) no effort is made to
highlight the junctions. Most slide by invisibly because MTV consists very
largely of pop videos and these long ago became the dominant influence in
the world of commercials. The two forms, and their directors, are now so
indistinguishable that on MTV it is often difficult to know which you are
viewing. So the junctions are imperceptible. Watching Kylie Minogue's
'Confide In Me' it is hard to believe it is not a commercial . . . and in a
sense, of course, that is just what it is.
All other networks, whatever their specialisation, are now subject to the
hegemony of the news; you cannot escape it even on Classic FM or Radio 3,
let alone Radio 1. But at MTV 'The News' often contains just three or four
items, such as singer George Michael's court case against Sony, the
renaissance of the vinyl LP, and Garth Brooks' second album selling 10m.
By-election defeats do not darken MTV's horizon. Others talk about the ideal
of European unity but MTV got there ages ago: not only do they broadcast
right across Europe (MTV Europe being a separate outfit from the American
MTV) they casually run commercials in German for their British audience, and
the presenters must be the most polyglot anywhere in television. Most speak
English with Dutch, German or Scandinavian accents. The way in which they
all, male and female, ogle and flirt with the cameras and hence the viewers
(not the easiest trick to manage without looking naff in the unromantic
confines of a studio, yet the MTV people almost always achieve it) has had a
clear, wide, and still growing effect on habits in terrestrial television.
Of course much of the content is enough to drive an adult up the wall. Watch
at any time of the day or night for more than 25 minutes or so and you will
almost certainly be subjected to 'rap', the monotonous, unmelodic, chanting
of doggerel by charmless young people in baseball caps, often worn back to
front. All stage concerts now seem to look identical, with lighting systems
linked via computer to the amplifiers (I assume) so that the lighting
endlessly flickers to the beat. Moreover, refreshing though it is to come
across some modern monochrome photography on television, the fashion for
black and white videos has become over dominant. Most irritating of all is
the inability of directors - whether of concert or video - to hold a shot
for more than (literally) a split second. The frequent assertion that
dislike for this sort of frenetic cutting is merely a reflection of age
seems odd: surely young people want to get a proper look at the famous
bottoms of their idols, whether Madonna or Prince.
There are countervailing strengths and attractions. Screen dancing is now
more widespread, expert and exciting than at any time since the great days
of Astaire and Kelly, thanks almost entirely to MTV, though admittedly there
is also much that is inept. The combination of music and image in pop
videos, while it can be pretentious, can also be beautiful and fascinating.
This is no small thing in a medium which - amazingly, since it relies so
heavily on pictures - is usually so dreadfully inferior to cinema in its use
of images. And if you doubt that the English have a particular flair for
this odd four-minute form of multi-medium artistry, spend a couple of hours
watching MTV and pay particular attention to the occasional French effort.
They are either ponderously sexy as in 'Tandem' by Vanessa Paradis, or sub
Magic Roundabout as in 'Mangez Moi' by Billy Ze Kick Et Les Gamins En Folie.
Many grown ups will feel they have had enough of MTV after only a few
minutes, but it holds the attention of children, from the age of about eight
upwards, like no other network. And that is the point: watching MTV is
nothing like watching BBC1, BBC2, ITV or Channel 4, and there are precious
few satellite or cable services which can say the same.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Arts: Bennett's 'Wind in the Willows' returns - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Alan Bennett dramatisation of The Wind in the Willows has been a huge
popular draw for the National Theatre at Christmas time since its
widely-acclaimed premiere four years ago. Now, returning to it for the first
time since that premiere, I love again much of what I had loved then, and
find new things to love too. But, as so often happens in life on returning
to scenes of bygone delight, I am startled to realise how much both it and I
have changed.
My strongest memory of the Nicholas Hytner production was of Mark Thompson's
vividly evocative decor, with its miraculous changes of scene. This is still
marvellous. By the time - about halfway through Act One - the Wild Wood
turns on its axis to reveal Badger's front door (slanted in a shelf that
suddenly appears in the wood's floor) and then turns again to take us down
into his home (an old-style resort of quiet distinction), I am as entranced
to re-see this changeable spectacle as any novice in the audience.
Of the features that have joined the production since it was new, the most
splendid is the Toad of Patrick Barlow. He is in every way larger than was
Griff Rhys-Jones; at times he reminds me of Dame Edna, at times of Billy
Bunter. He is so robust and so naughty that he seems at times to be adding
lines to the text; and it is a great compliment to him that in almost every
case I found afterwards the lines were actually Bennett's. 'Me dress up as a
washerwoman? . . . Couldn't I be a lady novelist?' Later, as a washerwoman:
'Shirts are to me, Sir, what daffodils is to Wordsworth'. I had not known
just how funny Toad's pretend death-scene ('Give me the sun]') is. And oh]
the way Barlow says, when Toad on trial is asked to renounce motor-cars,
'Never' - or rather 'Nev-ah' like Winston Churchill defying Hitler. A
Churchillian Toad? It heightens the central joke of Bennett's adaptation,
which is to point up the little-Englander there'll-always-be-a-riverbank
kernel of the original Kenneth Grahame story.
But the production - which has been recreated by Edward Kemp - has changed
in other ways too. It feels more child-oriented, and closer to pantomime. In
1990, there was some attempt to capture the moving chapter in Grahame which
most closely addresses the numinous: the Piper at the Gates of Dawn. I had
hoped that this scene would have been more successfully realised; but now it
has now been simply dropped.
And, like every childhood locale revisited, the world of The Wind in the
Willows seems, onstage, smaller and less innocent to me now. Not unlike the
Guy Burgess he once so memorably dramatised - Burgess who wanted to retain
the charm of English life though having betrayed England - Bennett wants
duplicitously to cash in on the nursery charm of Grahame's tale and at the
same time to mock the English class pretensions on which it is based. This
method of lampooning Englishness and cuddling it at the same time is typical
of Bennett, of course; he was at it as far back as Forty Years On. In about
80 per cent of The Wind in the Willows it is bliss to see how well he can
have his cake and eat it. But I find the other 20 per cent of the play both
irritating and depressing.
It is good to renew acquaintance with Michael Bryant's grave Badger. And it
is just as good to make the new acquaintance of Jasper Britton's spivvy
chief Weasel, of Crispin Letts's tender Mole, and to find the unsinkable
Betty Marsden as Washerwoman and Bargewoman. Michael Jayston, though
slightly too subdued and solemn, is a properly Home Counties old-school-tie
Rat. As for Barry Stanton, he very nearly persuades me that Albert the horse
is the best role in the whole piece.

(12 midnight ITV), is an exercise in Bill Forsyth cosiness, never mind the
pseudo-world weary trimmings. And keep a bleary eye on Newsnight (10.30pm
BBC2), taken for granted as a serious programme, though its supercilious vox
pop at the Dudley by-election threw up a slip of the tongue from a voter who
confused Lionel and Tony Blair. It passed director, editor, producer and
presenter, all of whom depend on appearing superior to the
lumpenproletariat, and doubtless got a good cheap laugh. News and current
affairs programmes, if not cub reporters, should know better.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Management: Multimedia comes to the business school -
Interactive teaching methods are about to revolutionise executive education,
says George Bickerstaffe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BICKERSTAFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like everything else, management teaching is about to be invaded by the
information superhighway, multimedia and CD-Rom. Many business schools,
including Harvard, are now working on the application of these technologies
to case studies and business simulations.
The 'case method' - using narratives of real situations to teach academic
principles - dates back to Harvard Law School (using summaries of court
cases, hence the name) in 1870. Harvard Business School picked up the idea
in the 1920s.
Since then it has become probably the most widely used method of management
teaching. It has also remained pretty static. Generations of business school
students have ploughed through pages of text, tables and graphs to 'prepare'
a case for the following day's class discussion.
Multimedia and interactive cases could well change all that.
Among the most advanced business schools in this area is Insead, based at
Fontainebleau, near Paris. It developed its first multimedia cases in 1992
and now uses several, including cases on Minitel and Swatch.
According to Albert Angehrn, professor of information systems at Insead and
the moving force behind the school's involvement in multimedia, the benefits
of technology are significant. He reckons that CD-Rom drives linked to
colour PCs (Insead's favoured delivery system) can provide several hours of
video and animation, thousands of photographs, pages of text and graphics
and charts.
And, he says: 'It is not as difficult to produce the cases as people think.
Given the basic information on a company we can produce an interactive case
within two weeks. And it is not enormously expensive.'
Insead based its first multimedia cases on the idea of an 'electronic book'
that allowed students to browse, mark, annotate and search for specific
topics or people in the text.
They also allowed direct access to related images and videos - the real
difference that multimedia brings. For example, the Swatch case allows
students to compare North American and European advertising approaches by
watching video clips, which appear in a small 'window' on the computer
screen. Students can also watch the steps involved in product development
and see a short interview with the product manager.
Newer cases have become increasingly sophisticated and less structured.
Angehrn argues that the editing implicit in writing down a case is being
removed. Students are now able to look at a company unbiased and with as
much information as they want. They can access real financial data on a
company via spreadsheets and carry out 'what-if' analyses.
In one marketing case they can evaluate advertisements and overall campaigns
by changing the style. The computer will suggest likely results. In other
words, they approach the case like real-life managers.
Angehrn and colleagues at Insead believe there is much further to go. They
have developed a pedagogical model, called Business Navigator, to put the
future of this type of highly interactive learning on a firmer basis.
In what they call a 'virtual interactive business environment', they see
students being able to 'navigate' around a company's physical environment
and through its organisational network (people) and informational network
(documents, files and so on).
Angehrn believes that as the technology develops and improves it will have a
fundamental effect. The implications of virtual reality in learning
situations, for example, are only beginning to become clear.
'There are really no limits to what we can do,' says Angehrn. He has already
designed cases and simulations where participants are prompted by on-screen
'stimulus agents', who suggest they attend meetings, take action or who
provide information.
Angehrn claims that students find interactive cases a participative way of
learning and one that promotes retention. 'They get to know the companies
and the issues much better - a video interview is far more alive than a
printed quote,' he says. 'And because it is interactive and they can 'move'
around the case they get a real experience of what people inside the company
actually do.'
There are, however, plenty of implications for business schools and
management academics that may not be positive or easy to accept.
Angehrn says they will have to think about how to combine three sets of
learning - traditional face-to-face sessions in the classroom,
self-learning, perhaps via by a computer, and group work or networking via
computers.
'We have been very good at designing classroom sessions,' he says. 'Now we
have to think about designing other educational forums where people are
learning together but not in the same place or even at the same time.'

Gadarene Design Group Galilee
King Herod
The Palace
Holy Land
Judea
December
Your Majesty, I am delighted that you have chosen to approach Gadarene
Design with this intriguing proposition - to market your revolutionary
population control programme. I have read our marketing director's
preliminary report following his meeting with you, and this is how I assess
the current situation.
Background. This brief comes to us following the failure of Magi Marketing
to adhere to the terms of their contract. While we normally have the
greatest respect for our competitors, we must make a brief observation here.
It is one thing to follow your star, but for their three representatives to
go missing en route for Bethlehem, and then send you a bill for the
'necessary purchase of gold, frankincense and myrrh' as gifts for the
inhabitants of some obscure stable is thoroughly unprofessional.
I can well understand that your faith in the Judean public relations
industry has been badly shaken by this experience. We shall do our utmost to
restore that faith, and I assure you we will only invoice you for fees and
expenses notified and agreed in advance.
The project. We understand that the Prophets Forecasting Centre has foretold
the birth of a saviour to the people of Israel. It has further given notice
that this 'saviour' will be a first-born child. Clearly this is a major
cause of concern, given the number of impressionable disciples wandering
round the region.
Your instinct to deal with the problem at the root, as it were, is surely
right, and we wholeheartedly endorse your decision to restructure Herod
Holdings and create a new division - Herod Population Control. However, the
words 'population control' are open to mis-interpretation, and we would
advise shortening the name to HPC Ltd.
Vision statement. We now come to your mission statement. No one could
disagree with your admirably worded opening: 'HPC's goal is to be a world
leader in the administration of people, while taking every opportunity to
empower managers to take initiatives at local level.'
When you go on to say that 'every area manager should ensure the slaughter,
without mercy, of the first-born child of every family,' we feel uneasy.
Surely 'slaughter' is an inappropriate word in this context.
What we are proposing is not slaughter, but the limited downsizing of
households - a temporary measure in the interests of national security. It
is, moreover, a measure with significant benefits for the population as a
whole:
It will reduce the nocturnal disruption to individual families, and thereby
maximise the productivity of the workforce.
It will reduce the weekly budget of the average household, giving them more
shekels to spend, thereby optimising the prospects for consumer recovery.
We would accordingly round off the vision statement as follows: 'Our
employees will prevail over the primary issue at the customer interface,
thereby optimising the benefits for the community as a whole.'
Corporate logo. As graphic designers, we attach great importance to the
corporate logo, and here we feel that a radical rethink is required. The
current logo, the bloody sword, is undeniably impressive - graphic indeed -
but open to misrepresentation.
We feel that HPC should concentrate less on its methods, and more on the
benefits that will follow from what is essentially a re-engineering process.
With the inevitable increased productivity levels, resurgence in the economy
and increased leisure time, more people will be able to enjoy holidays by
the Sea of Galilee. That is why we have chosen the logo of a golden orb
against a blue background - representing the warm sun in a cloudless sky
over a still sea.
Share option scheme. We feel there is a need to incentivise not only the
administrators, but also the people of Israel themselves. To encourage
families to join the household downsizing scheme, we should consider giving
them something in return. If we were to give every man, woman and child
(excluding the first-born) a share in HPC, it would help convey to them a
sense of ownership and commitment (see diagram).
Conclusions. This is one of the most challenging assignments we have
tackled, but we are confident that on the basis of the strategy we have
outlined, we can market HPC both to its own employees and to the wider
public, while achieving all your personal goals.
Coincidentally, we have just rewritten our own statement of vision and
values. It now reads as follows: 'Our commitment is to consistently exceed
expectations at the customer interface, regardless of external
considerations, which might include the termination of individual
life-cycles.' We feel this is so much more customer-friendly than our old
motto: 'We'll help you get away with murder.'
Please take our advice, your majesty. If you do not, God only knows what
will happen.
Kind regards etc etc.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Recruitment: Christmas Carol with a different tune -
Ebenezer Scrooge has survived until the late 20th-century and no longer
needs Bob Cratchit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the lasting themes in A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is the
pursuit of wealth for its own sake without social responsibility. Scrooge
sits in his counting house, oblivious to his own material needs and those of
his employee, Bob Cratchit.
The relationship between manager and employee has rarely been more pertinent
than it is today. Suppose, instead of focusing on the human condition,
Dickens had looked at the job itself. Suppose the spirits who visit Scrooge
after he has seen the apparition of his late partner, Marley, are
concentrating on something other than his personal history and prospects.
Imagine, for instance, he is visited by the spirits of jobs, past present
and future. What would they have beheld?
A condensed version of the story might have started thus:
The job was dead to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. Dead
as a doornail. Scrooge knew it was dead. Scrooge was the employer and
Scrooge needed no more jobs, not in the ordinary course of events.
Hard and sharp as flint - a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,
clutching, covetous old sinner - Scrooge sat in his counting house on a cold
bleak, foggy Christmas Eve. 'You'll not be in tomorrow, I suppose,' he said
to his solitary clerk.
'If quite convenient, sir.'
'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. Expecting the
employer to shoulder every social responsibility. If it's not holidays, it's
maternity leave, sick pay and pensions. Bah. Humbug,' said Scrooge. 'You'll
be downsized, soon enough. Downsized or outsourced.'
Scrooge stepped out into the cold, misty City streets and wound his way
through the throngs of last minute shoppers until he came to the chambers he
had once shared with his former partner, Marley. Was that Marley's face upon
the knocker. 'Nonsense]' said Scrooge to himself, twitching his eyes.
Settling himself in his nightgown, a bowl of gruel on his lap, he tried to
rid himself of Marley's image. But the face was everywhere about the room. A
noise of dragging chains and footsteps, at first faint, now clearer, could
be heard beyond the bedroom door.
The apparition as it passed through the door was visible at once as Marley,
dragging his heavy chain fixed to cash boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers and
deeds.
'Who are you?' asked Scrooge.
'Ask me who I was. This chain, these boxes, these trappings of the job. I
wear the chain I forged in life.' The spirit looked Scrooge in the face. 'I
am here to warn you. You may yet escape my fate, Ebenezer. You will be
visited by three spirits on successive nights.' The fading apparition
swirled throughout the open window out into the night. Scrooge tried hard to
say 'humbug' but could not and dragged himself back to sleep. It was already
dark when he awoke to hear the clock striking the hour that Marley had
foretold.
A light flashed inside the room and a hand drew aside the curtain of his
bed. It was a familiar figure, dressed in a boiler suit, holding a spanner
in the other hand and wearing a flat cap. 'I am the ghost of employment
past,' it said.
Holding Scrooge by the hand, he guided him out into the high street. Here
was the bank with its tall marble pillars, crafted plasterwork and long
counters staffed by clerks stamping passbooks, counting change and banking
the contents of weekly wage packets. Managers sat behind oak desks in
private offices, sipping tea brought by their secretaries. Outside town in
the car factory, the workers had their precise jobs defined and their unions
ensured that demarcation lines were maintained. The staff, their
nomenclature dictated by their white collars, had their desks and telephones
and adding machines and reporting structures.
One of the boiler-suited figures was complaining to the bank clerk. The wage
negotiations had been going badly. 'They can't make the five-per cent limit
stick,' he said. 'We took the vote on a show of hands. We're out tomorrow.'
No sooner had the image faded than Scrooge beheld another figure before him.
A pin-striped woman? Scrooge blinked. She was so young.
'I am the ghost of employment present,' said the spirit. It was Christmas
morning now and Scrooge found himself standing in the City streets, scored
by freshly dug trenches awaiting plastic cables for the information
super-highway.
There was Scrooge's clerk, Bob Cratchit, struggling to get away from the
traffic lights in his company Vauxhall Cavalier, still brand new. There was
Tiny Tim, sitting up in his Nuffield bed, paid for using Bob's Bupa
membership. Bob had made the most of his flexible benefit: extra holidays,
private medical insurance, company car. It helped subdue the fears arising
from the negative equity in the mock Georgian 'executive' home he had bought
at the height of the property boom.
The spirit pulled Scrooge by the hand, moving through the night, across the
land, to a former council house in Nottingham where a miner, not long
redundant was feasting his family. 'It's not going to last but the
re-training might work if there's a job at the end of it,' he said.
They passed students, drinking away the future with their talk of travelling
the world and working for nothing. They saw worried faces on redundant
middle managers, wondering how long their temporary work and casual
opportunities could stave off house repossession, and they saw the homeless,
long since deserted by hope. They passed a director, pondering the financial
pages, working out the best time to take his share options, knowing that in
a downsized, delayered workplace his own options were running out. Time to
telephone the headhunter.
As the spirit disappeared, Scrooge prepared himself for the final phantom as
it emerged from the gloom. 'Ghost of employment future. I fear you more than
any spectre I have yet seen,' said Scrooge.
The ghost said nothing but pointed to an empty office block. A middle aged
man, was it Cratchit? stood on the pavement looking bewildered. He was
speaking to Tiny Tim held in his arms: 'No one told me about this Tim. I
thought I had a job for life and it's gone. That old skinflint Scrooge said
he wanted a leaner organisation. He could get my job done more cheaply
outside. The outplacement was helpful. I have a short-term contract now but
frankly its not as good as before.
'Never mind, Tim. Something will come up.'
The mist descended and when it lifted they were back in Scrooge's chambers.
Time had passed. Scrooge himself was nowhere to be seen. A computer terminal
sat on a desk. In came Bob Cratchit, wearing jeans, with Tiny Tim bouncing
after him, now not so tiny. 'Once we've removed this, Tim, that will be the
end of it. He never realised. Who needs a counting house when you have
software systems? Who needs an office when you can work from home? Those
computer games you played in hospital served you well. We can live on the
royalties from your Sonic Scrooge game for the rest of our lives.'
The spirit showed Scrooge one last image - a gravestone on which he could
just make out the inscription. It said: The job.
'So it's true,' said Scrooge who emerged from the haunting a wiser man.
Renaming his business Scrooge Management Consultancy, he passed on the
accounting work to Cratchit Systems Inc, took time out, wrote a book, became
a guru, joined the lecture circuit and lunched on other people's expense
accounts. 'Work?' he said. 'This is what I call work.'

FT  21 DEC 94 / People: Ivory &amp; Sime splits board responsibilities
</HEADLINE>

   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management group, is to reorganise
its board, separating responsibility for the overall management of the
company from responsibility for investment management.
The split, involving the departure of six directors from the main board,
follows the arrival as managing director designate of Colin Hook. Hook
joined Ivory &amp; Sime last month from Caledonia Investments, the holding
company controlled by the Cayzer family, which took a 29.9 per cent stake in
Ivory &amp; Sime in July. He will formally replace Allan Munro as managing
director on January 1.
'We want investment managers to be able to focus purely on fund management
without having to worry about running a quoted company,' Hook says.
The six departing directors will join Ivory &amp; Sime Investment Management, a
hitherto dormant subsidiary. They are James Anderson, Richard Muckart,
Richard Ramsay, Michael Woodward, Mark Tyndall and Ian Paterson Brown, each
of whom supervises different investment sectors. That will leave a board of
eight people, six of whom are non-executive, under David Newbigging,
chairman.
Munro will remain on the main board, though concentrating on fixed interest
securities. Sir David Kinloch, a director of Caledonia Investment, joined
the board in September.

FT  21 DEC 94 / People: Glaxo appoints Niedel as research and development
director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glaxo has appointed James Niedel, 50, as its new director of research and
development in the wake of the departure of Franz Humer to Swiss rival
Roche.
Niedel, below, an American, is currently director of the Glaxo Research
Institute in North Carolina and a senior vice-president of Glaxo Inc, the
company's US subsidiary.
Niedel joined Glaxo in 1988 from Duke University, North Carolina, where he
was professor of medicine.
He will report directly to Sir Richard Sykes, Glaxo's chief executive and
former director of research and development.
Other appointments follow from Niedel's promotion. Terence Eaves,
development director of Glaxo Research and Development Ltd UK replaces
Niedel in the US. Goran Ando moves from group development director and has
been 'assigned special duties reporting to Sir Richard Sykes'. Ando is
replaced by James Palmer, currently Glaxo's chief medical officer in the US
and senior vice-president, medical operations.
Humer was also in charge of commercial strategy, and a replacement in that
function has yet to be made by Glaxo.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Packing for the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tired of hanging on to your old television packaging? Harassed by all that
expanded polystyrene encasing your new hi-fi? Perhaps the answer lies in
recycling.
That is the conclusion of a study* by the Expanded Polystyrene Packaging
Group, part of the British Plastics Federation. According to the report,
prepared by Douglas McWilliams of the Centre for Economics and Business
Research, half of all used expanded polystyrene (EPS) packaging will be
reclaimed and about 30 per cent recycled by 2000.
EPS recycling is already increasing. Around 3,700 tonnes, representing 17
per cent of total UK consumption, will be recycled this year - a 50 per cent
rise on 1993.
The report is bullish about the future. Used packaging, such as the EPS
encasing many new consumer durables, can be easily and cost-effectively
recycled.
Provided the packaging is retrieved before being mixed with household
rubbish, its potential ranges from recycling into new packaging to plastic
stationery and coat-hangers or compact disc cases.
Even 'contaminated' EPS packaging such as the vast quantities consumed
annually by the fishing and nursery industries, can be harnessed as a fuel
for generating electricity in incinerators. Although incineration is still
in its infancy, EPS is attractive as its calorific value is higher than
coal's.
However, there have been doubts recently over the material's environmental
impact. Critics have claimed EPS is not biodegradable, is bleached using
chlorines and even contains CFCs. Producers hotly deny such
'misperceptions'.
EPS is an increasingly popular packaging material. The UK alone produces
almost 21,000 tonnes a year.

<TEXT>
Chris Chadwick, commercial director of Leeds Permanent Building Society, has
resigned from the society's board; he will leave formally at the end of
January.
Chadwick, 42, has been one of three senior executives running the UK's fifth
largest society since its previous chief executive, Mike Blackburn, left to
run Halifax Building Society.
When the plans for a merger between Leeds Permanent and Halifax were
announced last month, the other two members of the executive troika - Roger
Boyes, finance director, and John Miller, information systems director -
were both named as members of the combined board. Chadwick, right, was not.
Leeds Permanent was unable to say whether he would receive any severance
pay.
Chadwick has been with the society since 1989, with a background in other
areas of the UK personal financial services sector. He was a founding
director of Burton Group Financial Services, and has also worked for
American Express.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Sweet source of power - Sugar
cane is being used for energy in Sao Paulo says Patrick McCurry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Electricity produced on vast sugar cane plantations in the countryside of
Sao Paulo, Brazil's wealthiest and most industrialised state, could help
relieve a predicted energy shortage.
Distilleries of fuel alcohol made from sugar have been generating their own
energy for years by burning the crushed cane in large boilers which produce
steam to power electricity turbines. Today an increasing number are seeking
to sell their surplus energy to Brazil's electricity grid.
The state of Sao Paulo produces more than half Brazil's harvest of around
220m tonnes of sugar cane. Most of the cane is used to produce fuel alcohol
for cars under a government alternative energy programme launched in the
1970s.
In recent years distilleries have been selling small amounts of excess
energy to distributors, or 'co-generating', and during this year's harvest
distilleries have begun selling energy to a distributor through long-term
contracts. Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz, which operates in the interior
of Sao Paulo state, has been the pioneering distributor in co-generation.
Eduardo Goncalves, CPFL chairman, says that an advantage of sugar cane
energy is that the harvest - May to November - occurs when rivers, and Sao
Paulo's hydroelectric capacity, are at their lowest. The state generates 60
per cent of its needs from hydro power and imports 40 per cent.
But Sao Paulo faces increasing energy problems because there is less
potential for increasing hydroelectric capacity. Nelson Garcez, a state
energy official, believes the state will have to import 70 per cent of its
needs within 15 years unless non-hydro energy sources are developed.
Goncalves says that while the co-generation programme is relatively small it
has important potential: 'There is a lot of talk about using bio-mass for
energy in Brazil, but this is the first major project under way.'
Two leading alcohol distilleries began supplying energy earlier this year to
CPFL under 10-year contracts. A further eight have signed one-year
contracts.
One of the long-term contracts is with Vale do Rosario distillery, which
crushes 18,000 tonnes of cane a day during the harvest. It supplies the
distributor with a capacity of 4MW, enough to power a small shopping centre.
Cicero Junqueira Franco, director of the distillery, says he intends to
increase generating capacity by installing higher-pressure boilers and more
sophisticated turbines. To increase capacity by 5MW would cost around
Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.4m).
But one obstacle to further development, he says, is uncertainty about the
government's pricing policy. A government-linked organisation regulates the
prices that distributors such as CPFL can pay for their electricity. The
price for this year was Dollars 41 per megawatt hour - low by international
standards, but enough to persuade the two distilleries to sign up long-term.
After transport costs CPFL is paying virtually the same price to sugar
distilleries as to import electricity from the huge Itaipu hydro plant on
the Brazil-
Paraguay border, although energy from the state's hydro plants is currently
about 25 per cent cheaper.
That price, however, is likely to increase because new hydro plants are in
more remote - and therefore costly - locations.
Many believe the trend in Brazil will move towards more flexibility on
pricing, which could stimulate co-generation.
Ademar Balbo, director of Galo Bravo distillery, says he hopes to negotiate
a supply contract with CPFL after investing Dollars lm in a more powerful
generator. This will increase the distillery's capacity to 9MW from 6MW,
leaving a surplus of 3MW.
'The prices that are being paid by the distributor are not that good at the
moment but it is a long-term investment. Brazil is growing and energy prices
are likely to go up,' he says.

Caroline Thomson, Channel 4's head of corporate affairs, is to take on a
powerful new job at BBC World Service.
The roles of the former deputy managing director David Witherow - who
retired in September - and that of Anthony Rendell, controller of strategy
and corporate affairs who retires next Easter, are being combined.
Thomson becomes the World Service's strategy and corporate affairs director,
and will deputise for Sam Younger, recently appointed managing director of
the World Service.
Thomson, who began her career as a BBC trainee in 1975 after studying
history and economics at York University, joins the World Service at a time
when it is committed to launching new services, while its government grant
is declining in real terms.
She worked on a range of BBC radio and television programmes, including
Analysis and Panorama, before joining Channel 4 in 1984 as commissioning
editor for finance and industry. She said although it had been exciting
working for Channel 4 'after 11 years it is time for a new challenge'.
She is the daughter of Lord Thomson of Monifieth, former chairman of the
Independent Broadcasting Authority.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Black Sea's dark future - The
conflict between economy and ecology is coming to a head in Odessa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arkadia beach on the Black Sea may have snow-white sand beloved by tourists,
but it is strewn with rusty metal drums; sludge and algae are visible on the
water.
Now, a row is brewing over sustainable development in a region so damaged by
pollution that it is on the brink of ecological death.
After committing itself to a Black Sea clean-up, the Ukraine government has
angered environmentalists with plans to build an oil terminal near Odessa,
up the coast from Arkadia, to handle up to 40m tonnes of oil per year. The
new terminal would help Ukraine reduce its dependence on Russia for
supplies.
As ministers and parliamentarians bicker over the plan, President Leonid
Kuchma last month gave his 'categorical' support for the new terminal now
awaiting approval from parliament.
The incensed green lobby argues that Kiev takes a cavalier approach to the
environment and dangerously promotes large industrial projects, just as the
Soviet Union did before Ukraine gained independence in 1991.
Valery Mikhailov, director of the Ukrainian Scientific Centre of Marine
Ecology, says Ukraine has failed to carry out the necessary environmental
impact study required by a declaration signed by all six Black Sea rim
states. He adds that Ukraine cannot guard against oil spillage.
Opponents of the plan argue that oil terminal leaks and tankers bypassing
weak regulation by dumping ballast water into the harbour would jeopardise
the health of 800,000 people who visit Odessa each summer.
The United Nations notes that the 'illegal discharge of ballast and bilge
and accidental spills during loading and unloading' account for far more oil
pollution than any land source.
'We should have beaches and resorts here,' says Mikhailov. 'They should put
it somewhere else. It is a disaster for Odessa.'
Environmentalists fear the threat to the ecosystem: it is on the Odessa bank
that about 60 per cent of the sea's fish and 70 per cent of the biomass
reproduce.
Flexing their new democratic muscle, the opponents have formed a committee
to try to block the project. Odessa's city council also protested, by
declaring the land could not be used, but it was overruled by the national
parliament.
According to mayor Eduard Gurvits, the former commercial port city founded
by Catherine the Great 200 years ago has to put industrial development
first.
The situation in Ukraine is matched in Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia
and Turkey, which this year approved a Black Sea Convention setting up the
legal conventions for maritime pollution control but who all, except Turkey,
must deal with the economic legacy of the Soviet Union's collapse.
'They all express the same kind of impotence,' says Laurence Mee, who leads
the Environmental Management and Protection Programme of the Black Sea in
Istanbul. 'You cannot do anything about the environment when you have an
economy that cannot afford it.'
Among the world's ecological problems, many of which are in the former
Soviet sphere, the Black Sea's are formidable.
Industrial waste from 17 Black Sea basin countries fed in by several large
rivers, especially the Danube and the Dnieper, has killed fishing stock and
devastated animal and plant life. Oil, toxic waste and ship ballast water
emitted around the rim compounds the Black Sea's lack of a good drainage
system to bring in fresh water. Incoming nutrients, as well as poisons, are
killing off species, such as oysters and clams, that would help clean the
sea.
Yuri Kastenko, Ukraine's environment minister, defends Ukraine's record,
pointing to a Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.4m) effort to clean up the Dnieper river.
That is not enough, critics say.
The Sea of Azov, just off the Black Sea, is even more polluted by steel,
coal and other industries of the Ukraine's Donbass region.
But as environmental enforcement has failed to improve under independence,
local concern is now centring on new oil projects, such as at Odessa, but
also an off-shore drilling exploration near the Crimean peninsula by JKX Oil
and Gas, a UK-based exploration company working mainly in the former Soviet
Union.
The UN deems offshore drilling a big potential hazard because of the 'risk
of blow-outs, fractured undersea pipelines, and other accidental oil spills'
that might further contaminate the sea. This anxiety applies to the new
project despite a relatively good aerial monitoring system used in Ukraine.
Hamish Curren, general manager of JKX Oil and Gas, concedes that 'the
consequences of a major accident are dire, but the chances of that happening
are possibly overstated'. He adds that bad experiences of developments under
the former Soviet Union, typically drilling in the Caspian Sea, are
misleading. 'The philosophy of that kind of operation is very different from
what western operators apply.'
Included in the Black Sea debate have been efforts to substitute tourism for
industry, since both the oil projects are so close to traditional resorts in
Crimea and Odessa. During the summer Odessa sponsored a conference on
developing tourism. Ecotec, a UK consultancy, found the Black Sea coast
'possesses all the key geographic resources including good climate, an
excellent coastline and landscape features' to expand tourism. But the poor
environment was a problem.
Frank Joyce, chairman of Ecotec, has observed that the local administration
must do a better job of tourism planning and coastal zone management along
Ukraine's 2,500km coast.
The other industry hurt by the environment is fishing. Only five species of
fish remain of the 26 caught in the 1960s when the Black Sea was one of the
world's mmost fecund sources. Total catch dropped from 900,000 tonnes in
1986 to 100,000 tonnes for all six Black Sea rim countries in 1992.
Altogether, the World Bank estimates the cost in bad health, poor fishing
and reduced tourism at around Dollars 1bn per year.
But as Ukraine moves ahead with the oil terminal, the ecologists throw up
their hands. Mikhailov reckons the clean-up would take up to 'two or three
times Ukraine's national income'.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Soap Wars: Washing of dirty linen leaves deep stains - When
Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble clash everyone pays a price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, DIANE SUMMERS and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clutching a brightly coloured package, Nabil Sakkab hurried to his office
and poured the contents on to his desk.
Before him was a heap of detergent, a substance Sakkab, as Procter &amp;
Gamble's European head of laundry products development, dealt with daily.
But as his scientist's eye looked more closely, he could see this sample was
different. Scattered among the white granules were myriad, tiny, pink
crystals.
'My God] They're really going to use it]' he exclaimed to colleagues. It was
mid-March 1994. What Sakkab had spotted was a secret weapon just deployed by
P&amp;G's arch rival Unilever: crystals of manganese, a catalyst that could
dramatically increase the cleansing power of a detergent.
Unilever was claiming its new formula was the biggest advance in fabric
detergents in 15 years. Sales of the product - Omo Power - were leaping in
the three European countries where it had been launched a month earlier. P&amp;G
was worried.
Sakkab was astounded that Unilever would use manganese. P&amp;G knew from its
research that manganese could speed the bleaching process. But it also
attacked fabrics - which was why the US company had abandoned it as a
possible detergent ingredient 10 years earlier.
Was Unilever committing a huge, and potentially costly, blunder in using the
catalyst?
With that question began the Great Soap War of 1994 and what was to become a
major debacle in international marketing - perhaps the biggest since the
botched reformulation of Coca-Cola in the early 1980s.
It was a battle that tarnished the image of the Pounds 6bn European
detergent industry, that may have permanently changed the rules of
engagement in one of the west's key consumer markets, and raised serious
questions about management capabilities and structures in two of the world's
biggest companies.
For Unilever, it was a protracted nightmare. Its new Persil and Omo Power
detergents, launched last February, were supposed to regain the initiative
in the European fabric detergent market. Instead the detergent was subjected
to unrelenting media scrutiny and a fiercely hostile campaign by P&amp;G. The
trouble was, the flaws exposed were all too real.
Power was not just another new product. It was intended to blaze a trail in
the consumer goods business by combining advanced product technology and
innovative techniques of pan-European marketing.
Much was also riding on the success of the product for one man: Niall
FitzGerald, Unilever's global co-ordinator of detergents since 1991. The
ambitious 49-year-old Irishman with 27 years' service at Unilever had risen
through the ranks, thanks to ability, drive and a persuasive charm.
FitzGerald enjoyed nothing more than challenging Unilever's stuffy
conventions. When he was eligible for his first company car he chose a
powerful Kawasaki motorcycle. The formfiller balked. FitzGerald told him:
'There's no rule says I can't have a motorbike.'
FitzGerald knew that his ability to turn round Unilever's ailing detergent
business would determine his hopes of eventual ascent to the joint
chairmanship of the group. He was out to change things in detergents,
breaking down the bureaucratic structures that made Unilever less than fleet
of foot in launching new products.
In Europe P&amp;G had long since overtaken it in fabric detergents. The gap grew
in the late 1980s when Unilever was slow to develop concentrated versions of
the product. What Unilever needed to win back the lead was a quantum leap in
detergent effectiveness.
A senior Unilever executive said: 'We knew our second entry into the
concentrated market had to be something very different, not just in the
laboratory but to the consumer. Mrs Jones had to notice and say: 'This
really is different'.'
The salvation was to be science. A veteran of the company's detergents
business said: 'Technology creates bigger swings in market power for
detergents than any other consumer product.' Selling a big new idea to
consumers can differentiate a new product from the pack, and brings big
gains in market share.
In this case the big idea was the manganese catalyst that Unilever, long
after P&amp;G had given up, continued to pursue. After five years of development
Unilever decided last December that it had tamed the metal.
If the science was ambitious, so was the marketing. Exploiting its new
pan-European structure, co-ordinated like P&amp;G's from Brussels, Unilever
planned to launch Power in 11 countries in short order.
It was a marketing blitzkrieg without precedent in Europe. It was also a
plan that would leave Unilever terribly vulnerable if something went wrong.
By late February 1994 the alarm bells were ringing at P&amp;G's world
headquarters in Cincinnati, Ohio. P&amp;G was also working on a new detergent -
Ariel Futur - for launch later in the year. As sales of Power took off in
Europe P&amp;G was anxious to find the ingredient underlying the rival's
success.
When the answer came from Brussels - the pink crystals pinpointed by Sakkab
 -no one was awaiting it more eagerly than Ed Artzt, P&amp;G's famously
domineering chairman. Nicknamed the Prince of Darkness, Artzt had a
well-earned reputation for responding rapidly and ruthlessly when he felt
P&amp;G's interests were threatened.
The Power detergent was, in his view, just such a case. Unilever was not
only claiming to have stolen a technological march, it was basing its claim
on a formulation which P&amp;G had reason to believe was fundamentally flawed.
But was Unilever now proving that conclusion wrong?
Sakkab's findings suggested not. Some dark dyes in cotton and viscose
fabrics reacted badly to the detergent. A week after finding the crystals he
and his colleagues in P&amp;G's European Technology Centre were discovering
holes in clothes they had washed in Power. They also believed - although
this is a claim that has subsequently won little support from independent
testers - that the manganese lingered in the clothes and would continue to
damage them when washed in other manufacturers' detergents.
Armed with this belief, Artzt resolved on an unusual move. During a visit to
London on March 31 he called at Unilever House, the company's imposing
art-deco headquarters by Blackfriars Bridge. In a meeting with FitzGerald
and other top executives he demanded that they withdraw their new detergent.
Power products, he said, were so flawed as to be likely to cause significant
overall damage to the fabric detergent market.
Artzt's warning left FitzGerald and his colleagues suspicious. True, there
was a long tradition of collaboration between Unilever and P&amp;G on technical
issues. For all the aggression in the marketplace the two companies had
often privately alerted one another to flaws in their products and worked
together to solve them.
But a visit from P&amp;G's chairman was something else. 'It was too theatrical,'
said a Unilever executive who was at the meeting. Another said: 'If it had
been anybody but Artzt - say Helmut Maucher (chairman of Nestle) - we would
have believed him.'
In vain Artzt argued that he had broader industry interests at heart. His
Unilever audience concluded that he was on a massive spoiling operation to
undermine their important new product. They decided to ignore him.
Over the next few weeks Artzt and FitzGerald exchanged increasingly
acrimonious letters. Their subordinates met once in Brussels to try to agree
on joint testing. But Unilever, insisting that its tests had shown no fault,
refused to accede to P&amp;G's demand that Power be withdrawn from the market
before joint testing started.
FitzGerald could see no need to take the costly and humiliating step of
withdrawing a product that had been tested by scientists and consumers for
two years without incident. Yet in ignoring P&amp;G's private warning he laid
Unilever and its Power detergent open to an unprecedented campaign of public
vilification.
With hindsight, senior Unilever executives still argue there was little they
could have done to forestall an onslaught so contrary to industry
conventions. They appear convinced that P&amp;G had been planning a frontal
attack on Power all along.
P&amp;G vehemently denies this is true. But in one sense it is irrelevant. The
inescapable fact is that whatever P&amp;G's intentions, it was Unilever that
provided it with ammunition by launching a flawed product.
According to company executives, Unilever management compounded the problem
with two blunders that magnified Power's defects.
First, it was decided to use a high concentration of the manganese catalyst
to maximise the bleaching effect. Second, Unilever marketed it as a
detergent for broad use with all fabrics, water temperatures and colours,
rather than as a more specialised product.
Unilever wanted a broad 'positioning' to cut through the proliferation of
detergent varieties and specifications that had been sowing increasing
confusion among consumers.
It was aware throughout that Power would inflict somewhat more damage on
fabrics than did earlier detergents. But it accepted that as the price of
more effective stain removal.
To understand these decisions - which Unilever executives confirm were taken
at a high level of the company - one has to imagine the sheer enthusiasm
about the Power products that had FitzGerald and his team in its grip.
They were egged on by the positive consumer response evident during testing,
particularly last autumn when the new formula was applied to an existing
Unilever brand in the Netherlands, All-Activ, and sold without relabelling
as a new product. A senior Unilever executive said: 'We got very positive
consumer responses and got nothing suggesting there was a problem.'
It seems that FitzGerald and those around him, buoyed by these results, got
carried away and pushed the product harder than had been the norm.
Detergent companies often 'front-load' a new product with bigger dosages of
the most active ingredient in the launch phase to get the strongest consumer
response. Normally they later pull back to strike a balance between cleaning
effect and profit. Unilever did not - or at least, not soon enough.
A senior Unilever executive said: 'I think we were very enthusiastic about
an exciting new product and did not look closely enough at the negatives.
Somewhere between research and marketing something went wrong - under the
normal pressure to be first to the market.'
The first public sign of trouble for Unilever came with a story in the Dutch
press on April 27, purporting to quote a spokesman for P&amp;G alluding to
fabric damage caused by Power. In a confusing twist, the spokesman said the
company would also put 'Power' stickers on its own detergents.
Within 48 hours Unilever called a press conference denying the claims. It
launched two writs for product defamation and trademark infringement.
P&amp;G's press campaign was remarkable not just for its ferocity but for its
moments of ineptitude. Neither Unilever nor P&amp;G was skilled in the art of
corporate public relations. Past masters at promoting their brands through
advertising, they have tended to try to keep out of the corporate spotlight.
The brands, not the companies, were supposed to do the talking.
P&amp;G, however, undoubtedly had the edge - no doubt in part because it had for
the first time enlisted the help of an outside PR firm, The Rowland Company,
a Saatchi &amp; Saatchi subsidiary. As for Unilever, it had obviously failed to
anticipate how violently P&amp;G would react and how ill-equipped it was to
handle the onslaught.
Until the end of May the Anglo-Dutch company just about managed to hold its
own with consumers. Although Power sales fell after every P&amp;G onslaught,
Unilever was able to rebuild them with advertising and special offers.
FitzGerald knew, however, that the position could not be held for long.
Apart from anything, he and his colleagues had realised that P&amp;G had a point
about Power's effect on some dark dyes. Although Unilever considered the
circumstances extreme and irrelevant to consumers, the criticism would have
to be met - and that meant changing the product's formulation.
On the first weekend in June three events transformed the nature of the
battle. That Friday Unilever announced that it was dropping the lawsuits
against P&amp;G, after P&amp;G assured Unilever that its spokesman had been
misquoted. It also announced that it was reformulating the detergent, with
an 80 per cent cut in the catalyst to solve the dye problem.
Third, P&amp;G released to the press a set of colour pictures showing clothes
purportedly suffering the ill effects of Power - including memorable shots
of some tattered boxer shorts which were duly reproduced by the press all
over Europe - plus results from six test institutes. P&amp;G had to backtrack on
the pictures when it was pointed out that the shorts were from its own
tests, not those of the institutes. It was one of several examples where P&amp;G
went over the top in its campaign.
Nevertheless, the awkwardness of Unilever's position was plain to see. Much
as the company tried to deny that there was a problem and to claim that the
product's effectiveness was unchanged, by reformulating Power it had
conceded an important point to the opposition.
Unilever also decided to retreat from Power's broad market positioning to a
more specialised niche - revamping the packaging to focus use on lower
temperatures and white fabrics.
This was a climbdown since Unilever had set out at the time of launch to
present Power as a product for broad use in order to reduce consumer
confusion. It was a shift that, for the time being, the company
understandably chose not to broadcast - proclaiming disingenuously that
diluting the catalyst was designed to broaden Power's usefulness.
With the June announcements 'all hell broke loose', as one Unilever man put
it. Power was front-page news in several European countries - notably in the
Netherlands, where it had the added spice of humbling a home-grown
multinational - and was generating the wildest stories.
In Sweden a leading environmental campaigner claimed on television that
Power had placed the nation's clothes in imminent jeopardy. Unilever blames
P&amp;G's 'well-organised briefing system' for much of the trouble.
A senior Unilever executive said: 'We found we were subject to a ruthlessly
well-organised knocking copy campaign. P&amp;G was literally running around
Europe to consumers' associations, washing machine manufacturers, retailers
and anybody else who would listen giving them a very extensive technical
briefing with lots of lurid pictures.
'We were chasing this well-armed arsonist around Europe. It took a week to
put out each fire. That's why we appeared on the defensive.'
The company was not only defensive with the press and public, it also failed
to find an effective counter to what eventually became a stream of reports
from consumers' associations criticising Power detergents. Ignoring the
associations' public support, its usual response was to question their
competence. Behind the scenes, both it and P&amp;G subjected them to the most
intense pressure to take sides.
Nothing summed up Unilever's inadequacy better than the response of a senior
company executive to a reporter's hypothetical question. If a negative
television news item about Unilever's detergent was followed by an
advertisement extolling its virtues, which would the consumer/viewer
believe? 'The advertisement, of course,' the executive replied.
By the summer the battle over Power detergents had become an obsession for
top executives in both companies. In the anger of battle, a certain loss of
perspective was evident on both sides.
As one supermarket executive, subjected by both companies to persistent
lobbying, put it: 'Both think they are morally right and that the other side
has been practising the black art.'
One UK retailer held a dinner party during the summer for a group of its
suppliers. Among the guests were Andrew Seth and Mike Clasper, respectively
heads of UK detergents at Unilever and P&amp;G. The spectacle of them glowering
at each other all evening has become a legend in one of the soap companies.
At Unilever, FitzGerald was spending all his time on the problem even though
Power accounted for only one-twentieth of Unilever's global detergent sales.
Worse for him, his relationship with the company's ruling 'special
committee', consisting of the chairmen of the UK and Dutch arms of Unilever,
was changing.
FitzGerald had made the running throughout the crisis, informing his
superiors of his actions. But insiders say that during the summer Sir
Michael Perry and Morris Tabaksblat, the British and Dutch co-chairmen,
started to take a more active role. Their questioning of the detergents team
became more pointed. Finally, the concern of one co-chairman emerged in
public.
When Morris Tabaksblat flew to Beijing in September his purpose was to open
a new Walls ice cream factory to serve the burgeoning Chinese market. But he
clearly had something closer to home on his mind. It took little prompting
from the journalists travelling with him to elicit the first clear,
dispassionate and on-the-record explanation from a senior Unilever executive
of Power's fatal flaw. Remarkably, it had taken a full five months of crisis
for Unilever to speak up.
Tabaksblat said: 'We made a mistake. We launched a product which had a
defect which we had not detected.' He spoke of a lack of appropriate
safeguards in tests before the launch and admitted that certain textile dyes
which reacted badly with the catalyst had not been in Unilever's 'test
battery'.
Back in Europe those in the thick of the battle felt betrayed. They came,
sarcastically, to refer to Tabaksblat's apparently unscripted intervention
as 'The Beijing Initiative'.
No one was more embarrassed than FitzGerald. At the very moment that
Tabaksblat's remarks were becoming public property, he was on a Warsaw stage
expounding to Unilever staff on his favourite theme about changing the
company's culture.
As he spoke an aide passed him a note summarising Tabaksblat's comments.
Stunned, he took the next plane home to rally the troops.
No one was more delighted than Artzt. At last Unilever had admitted that P&amp;G
had a point. A newspaper article reporting Tabaksblat's remarks has pride of
place on his Cincinnati office wall.
In the months since Tabaksblat spoke Unilever has had ample opportunity to
count the cost of its Power failure.
After spending Pounds 200m on developing, manufacturing and marketing Power
products, Unilever's share of the European detergent market is no better
than a year ago - a poor second to P&amp;G.
A heavy price has also been exacted on reputations - that of the company and
of its Persil and Omo brands. The brand damage 'is not yet considerable but
if it's not put right, it could be', says a senior Unilever executive.
As for the company, Unilever's pan-European structure was subjected to its
first big test with the Power launch, and was found wanting. Its management
looked flat-footed and inflexible. Its image as a savvy marketer and
innovator was undermined.
A senior supermarket executive said: 'We know Unilever well. Normally they
are a class act but they don't look too clever now.'
But the damage is not only to the Anglo-Dutch combine. The whole detergents
industry will have reason to regret the affair if, as seems likely, it
exacerbates consumers' scepticism towards manufacturers. A leading retailer
said: 'The whole sector is drowning in over-claiming and publicity which
leaves consumers confused.'
P&amp;G, for its part, may have halted Power in its tracks. But its executives
are aware that they failed to win the outright victory of forcing Unilever
to take Power off the market.
Moreover, P&amp;G has reinforced its widespread image as a ruthless,
self-seeking organisation with the unedifying sight of it picking a street
fight with Unilever. 'It is a gross misperception. It needs to be remedied
but it can't be changed overnight,' a senior P&amp;G executive said. For some
people in P&amp;G, achieving this depends on the personality of whoever succeeds
Artzt when he retires in the next few years.
Both companies are also learning painful lessons. One is that the rules of
the game appear to have changed for good when it comes to testing and
marketing new products.
Unilever admits that complex new detergents might now have to be subjected
to testing as exacting as for food or pharmaceuticals. 'With a quantum
change in technology, we may have to re-examine all our test regimes,' said
a senior detergents executive.
Some extreme tests might not be relevant to consumers but Unilever says it
wants to find anything which competitors could use against it. That can only
raise costs and slow the pace of innovation.
Unilever faces a formidable challenge. In the coming months it has to
rebuild confidence in its Persil and Omo brands and its own staff's morale,
as well as finding new products in which it can use its pioneering
technology without problems.
It will also have to address the organisational and management issues the
conflict has raised. This is not, executives stress, a question of finding a
culprit. 'No one person' is to blame, says a senior Unilever man. 'All the
checks and balances work together.'
Looking to the future, all eyes are on FitzGerald. He rallied the troops at
every setback and has started to preach forcefully the lessons learned.
Significantly, this week Unilever delayed his expected ascent to its special
committee by a year to 1996 - on the grounds that he still had much to do in
detergents.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Derelict pit site to generate 800 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 800 jobs are to be created on the site of the last deep coal mine
in the Lancashire coalfield, which employed 760 miners before closing last
year.
Morrisons, the Bradford-based supermarket group, yesterday announced plans
for a warehouse and national distribution centre on about half of the 140
acres once occupied by Parkside colliery, near Newton-le-Willows, St Helens.
The site, close to the intersection of the M62 and M6, is near the 'time
centre' of Britain - the point at which the business centres of Scotland and
London are equidistant for HGV travel. The location puts all of Morrisons'
55 supermarkets within a few hours' driving. The West Coast main railway
line also runs alongside it.
Although in the Lancashire coalfield, the site is also within the Merseyside
county boundary, meaning that some of the costs of dereliction clearance,
laying services and motorway linkage will probably qualify for Merseyside's
special European Union funding.
Morrisons originally wanted to build the distribution centre about 17 miles
to the south, near Northwich, but was refused planning consent on
environmental grounds.
The company yesterday announced a development deal with British Coal
Property and applied for planning consent. This is unlikely to be refused,
as indicated by the enthusiastic presence of St Helens Borough Council
leaders and Mr John Evans, Labour MP for the area, at the announcement.
Work is scheduled to start in spring, with the first phase bringing 350
jobs. Completion in 1996 will bring about 450 more jobs.
The closure of Parkside's modern pit last year provoked angry confrontation
with the NUM mining union. In one protest Mrs Anne Scargill, wife of Mr
Arthur Scargill, the union's president, led three other women in an
underground sit-in. They entered the mine by tagging on to a party of
schoolteachers on an organised visit.
Any lingering hopes of saving the mine through a sale to a private operator
were dashed in October. After no acceptable offers, the twin 200 ft winding
towers were demolished.
Some coalfield campaigners deplored yesterday's development, saying the
planned jobs might not be 'proper' ones. However most are expected to
require physical skills.
Ms Carole Hudson, chief executive of St Helens council, said many other jobs
would be created in transport, freight, local supplies and maintenance.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Development of biggest untapped gas field approved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday approved development of the UK's biggest remaining
untapped natural gas field.
Gas from the Pounds 1.5bn Britannia field, 130 miles north-west of Aberdeen,
will be sold exclusively to independent gas marketing companies and power
generators. It will be the first time that a big North Sea gas field has not
included British Gas among its buyers.
Some of Britannia's gas remains to be sold. But the list of initial buyers
reflects the changing nature of the UK market, which is to be fully opened
to competition by 1998, the year Britannia production will start.
Kinetica, the natural gas joint venture between Conoco of the US and
PowerGen of the UK, is thought by many analysts to be among the biggest
buyers of Britannia gas. Others include Mobil of the US, National Power and
Total of France.
Mr Jim Briggs of Chevron, the US company which will operate Britannia with
Conoco, said yesterday that buyers did not want details of the contracts to
be divulged.
In the past most gas contracts were on the long-term, 'take or pay' model,
under which wholesale buyers had to pay for the gas even if they failed to
sell it on to their customers. There has been industry speculation that some
of the Britannia contracts may be more flexible.
Observers note that a British spot market in surplus gas is likely to
develop once competition is introduced by 1998. In addition the UK-Continent
Interconnector, a pipeline linking the UK and European gas grids, is
expected to be completed in 1998, opening up the prospect of large-scale
exports of gas to European customers. Conoco, the biggest participant in
Britannia, also has a big stake in the Interconnector.
Britannia, which was discovered in 1975, has recoverable reserves of 2,600bn
cu ft of natural gas and 140m barrels of condensate, a naturally occurring
gasoline. The field's life is estimated at 30 years with a peak production
plateau of six years.
It will be the first North Sea field which will be operated jointly, with
Chevron and Conoco sharing operational responsibilities.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said companies operating in Britain were
likely to gain about 70 per cent of the value of total contracts connected
with the field. The first big contract has gone to Trafalgar House Offshore
Fabricators, which will build the Pounds 57m platform deck.
Contracts to be awarded next year include the laying of a 195km (121 miles)
gas pipeline to connect Britannia with the terminal at St Fergus in
Scotland. A decision will be taken next year whether to expand the existing
terminal, or build another nearby. A separate 45km pipeline will take up to
70,000 barrels a day of liquid condensate to the nearby Forties pipeline
system.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Crackdown on abuse of legal aid: Loopholes for rich targeted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday announced a crackdown on abuse of the legal aid
scheme by wealthy businessmen who receive public funds to fight court
actions.
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, outlined proposals to close loopholes in
the scheme, which will help an estimated 3.5m people in 1994-95 at a cost of
Pounds 1.4bn to the taxpayer.
The changes follow a public outcry over several high profile and expensive
cases, where apparently wealthy businessmen have received millions of pounds
of aid.
In June Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, the Lord Advocate, revealed in the Lords
that Dr Jawad Hashim had received Pounds 4.01m in legal aid. Dr Hashim, a
former president of the Arab Monetary Fund who is being sued for Pounds 33m
he allegedly siphoned off from it to private Swiss bank accounts, owns six
luxury homes around the world.
Other cases include the Pounds 3.7m aid received by Mr Roger Levitt, the
disgraced financial services salesman, to fight fraud charges. Mr Levitt
continues to live a luxury lifestyle in north London.
Lord Mackay said yesterday: 'Legal aid is not there to be exploited by the
wealthy.'
Among the proposals under consideration are:
Limiting to Pounds 100,000 the amount of equity value in a house that is
ignored for legal aid means assessment.
Developing the idea of legal aid as a loan.
Giving officials power to refuse legal aid if an individual leads an
apparently wealthy lifestyle.
Confiscating any assets undisclosed by applicants for criminal legal aid.
Freezing the assets of applicants for criminal legal aid with legal aid
costs being recovered from them if the applicant is subsequently convicted.
Including assets under dispute or frozen by the courts in means assessment
for civil legal aid.
The government is seeking views on its present position that it would be
wrong to ban criminal or civil legal aid for non-UK citizens fighting cases
in British courts.
It is also conducting a fundamental review of spending on legal aid as part
of the wider Treasury review of spending by the Lord Chancellor's
department.
A green paper on cash-limiting legal aid by creating a system of
'fundholders for justice' modelled on the GP fundholder system is expected
to published next spring. Lord Woolf, the Law Lord, is also conducting a
review of the civil justice system for Lord Mackay, part of the purpose of
which is to look at ways of improving access to justice and reducing the
cost of going to court.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Farm wages board granted reprieve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday bowed to pressure from farmers and their employees
and said it would keep the Agricultural Wages Board, the country's last
remaining statutory minimum pay body.
The decision, believed to have been won by Mr William Waldegrave,
agriculture minister, in the face of opposition from more hardline
ministers, was warmly welcomed by both sides of the industry.
They had feared that the board, which sets minimum pay, holidays, sick pay
and overtime rates for 180,000 farmworkers in England and Wales, would
suffer the same fate as the wages councils which were abolished last year.
Mr Waldegrave said: 'It is clear from the responses to consultation that
there is wide acceptance, from both sides of the agricultural industry, of
the present arrangements.' Out of 4,000 responses to the Ministry of
Agriculture only 10 advocated abolition.
The TGWU general union, which represents farmworkers, welcomed what it
called 'an absolute victory', saying the government had decided not to risk
legislation that could run into opposition from rural Conservative MPs. Mr
Barrie Leathwood, national secretary of the rural and agricultural workers'
section, said countryside interests had played an important part in two
other government retreats this year - on privatisation of the Forestry
Commission and the Post Office.
Mr Leathwood said: 'Mr Waldegrave is a farmer himself and understands how
the industry operates. He will have used the argument about the impact (of
abolition) on rural areas and rural earnings.'
Mr Gavin Strang, Labour agriculture spokesman, has campaigned strongly
against abolition and described the government's decision as 'a truly
welcome U-turn'. He said a report by the London School of Economics had
shown that minimum wages had not reduced agricultural employment.
The National Farmers' Union said the board was central to good industrial
relations and to establishing an effective career structure for workers.
Farmworkers, whose pay body has been under review for 18 months, have had a
relatively good year. They won an above average pay rise of 4.9 per cent in
the summer, and the extension of full-time workers' rights to 38,000
part-timers from next month.
Mr Waldegrave said the board would continue to be kept 'under close review'.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Electricity from renewable sources to double
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday gave the go-ahead to the doubling of the amount of
electricity generated from renewable sources of energy such as wind and
waste.
More than 500 candidates bid for funding in the third and biggest round of
subsidies for renewable energy projects.
The subsidies - the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation - in the form of a levy on
electricity bills, are designed to encourage the development of renewable
energy sources which are still more expensive than conventionally generated
electricity.
However, average prices in the latest round were lower than in the past,
reflecting technological advances and growing experience.
The average price for a unit of electricity from large wind farms dropped by
more than half to 4.32p per kWh. Power is sold into the wholesale
electricity 'pool' by PowerGen and National Power at the average price of
about 2.5p per kWh.
More than 140 bids to generate almost 630MW of electricity in England and
Wales received final approval. In Scotland, 30 proposals to generate 76MW
were approved - about double the government's original estimate. However,
the proposals still require local planning consent.
Assuming that not all bids succeed, the government estimated that the third
round should increase the total amount of electricity generated by renewable
sources in England and Wales by 300MW-400MW from 340MW.
The government said it would announce a fourth round of subsidies next year
as a further step to reach its aim of generating 1,500MW of electricity from
renewables by 2000.
The policy of encouraging renewable sources forms part of the UK's plan to
meet its 1992 Rio Earth Summit commitment to cut carbon dioxide emissions to
1990 levels by 2000. It is also designed to stimulate renewable energy
industries.
The government's announcement was welcomed by wind power generators, which
had feared a backlash after recent adverse publicity about the damage to the
landscape from wind installations. Similar anxieties had been voiced by
waste power supporters after recent allegations that incinerators emitted
toxic gases.
In the event, bids from both technologies were highly successful, with
approval for 31 wind projects and 20 waste schemes in England and Wales.
Triodosbank, a Netherlands-based bank, announced it would next month launch
a wind fund through Mercury Provident, its UK partner, to invest in the wind
power industry. The fund, which is similar to a scheme already in existence
in the Netherlands, hopes to raise Pounds 10m from investors.

FT  21 DEC 94 / BBC in US deal for news service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BBC plans to launch its 24-hour satellite news service, BBC World, in
the US in February in a deal with International News Network (INN) of New
York.
The launch, much earlier than expected and less than a month after BBC World
goes on air in Europe, is designed to take advantage of changes in US cable
regulations.
The Federal Communications Commission recently decided that cable operators
could charge more for their basic cable packages if new channels were
offered.
Mr Reese Schonfeld, the former president and chief executive of the CNN
network, who is chairman of INN, said yesterday that he expected a high
proportion of big cable operators to at least test BBC World in their
markets.
He conceded, however, that competition would be intense with more than 60
channels competing for about six additional slots.
Mr Schonfeld said CNN provided the who, what, where and when of television
news. 'BBC World will add the how and the why with the help of pieces from
Newsnight and Panorama,' he added.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Sharp jump in M4 hints at improved confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp jump in bank lending and in M4, the government's broadest measure of
the money supply, yesterday gave a tentative indication that companies and
consumers may have become sufficiently confident to start borrowing in
earnest.
According to the Bank of England, M4 rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per
cent between October and November. In the 12 months to November M4 increased
4.5 per cent, up from an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in October but still
well within the government's monitoring range of 3 per cent to 9 per cent.
Part of the rise in M4 came from a higher-than-expected public sector
borrowing requirement in November. There was also a jump in sterling lending
to the M4 private sector, which consists of UK residents other than banks,
building societies and the public sector. Such lending was Pounds 4.5bn,
compared with Pounds 1.8bn in October.
This figure was surprisingly strong and seemed to indicated a surge in
lending by foreign banks.
Figures from the British Bankers' Association, which cover lending by the
main British banking groups, showed a rise in sterling lending to a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 1.14bn in November from Pounds 633m in October.
Even allowing for lending by building societies, that means about Pounds 2bn
of lending by other, mainly foreign, banks.
Mr Tim Sweeney, director-general of the BBA, pointed out that consumers had
increased their borrowing by nearly Pounds 1bn in the past six months,
compared with less than Pounds 100m in the previous half year. He said:
'Although this might reflect growing consumer confidence the turnround
coincides with the initial impact of increased fiscal tightening and may
represent an increased need to borrow.'
The Bank of England revised its estimate of annual growth in M0, the narrow
measure of money supply, from 7.1 per cent to 7 per cent.

<TEXT>
The UK and Republic of Ireland governments last night underlined their
determination to keep the Northern Ireland peace process on track after a
90-minute meeting at Downing Street between Mr John Major and Mr John
Bruton, his new counterpart.
Speaking after yesterday's 'very refreshing' meeting, Mr Major said British
and Irish officials would meet early next month to press on with efforts to
agree the joint framework document that the two governments hope will
provide the basis for a lasting political settlement.
Another meeting 'at foreign minister level' would take place a few days
later.
Questioned on the prospect of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, joining
all-inclusive talks on the province's future, Mr Major said that
'substantial progress' on the decommissioning of arms would have to be made.
Mr Bruton, who is to meet Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, this morning,
emphasised that the decommissioning of weapons was not the only issue to be
addressed in preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Breaches of rules emerge as Lautro imposes fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Serious breaches of regulatory rules emerged yesterday with the announcement
of fines imposed by Lautro, the life insurance watchdog, on two friendly
societies - Homeowners and Ideal Benefit.
Homeowners, which has about 250,000 members, was fined Pounds 125,000 and
must pay the regulator's costs of Pounds 30,000 after admitting nine charges
relating primarily to misleading advertisements over a period of more than
two years.
Ideal Benefit, which has only 23,000 members, was fined Pounds 25,000 and
told to pay costs of Pounds 6,000 after admitting that for almost four years
from April 1990 it had not had effective procedures in place to ensure it
met regulatory standards.
The charges against Homeowners were mainly about advertisements in
newspapers and through direct mail for single premium investments -
particularly growth bonds.
Lautro, which has been superseded by the Personal Investment Authority, also
criticised the society for 'frequent and inordinate delay in making any
satisfactory response'.
Mr Roger Hocking, Homeowners' commercial director, said that following
Lautro's visits earlier this year and the subsequent inquiry, the society's
compliance manager had left by mutual agreement.
Homeowners has appointed an assistant compliance officer and is in the
process of recruiting a senior compliance manager.
Lautro did not find any sign that investors had suffered but the society is
writing to all the 17,000 members affected and has set up a helpline for
them.
The charges against Ideal Benefit related to faults uncovered in the second
round of routine inspection visits by the regulator, which was carried out
in March this year.
They include not taking up references for people appointed as sales agents,
poor record-keeping, and not sending full information to people who
complained.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Court raps government over night flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Transport was yesterday forced to reconsider its current
controls on night flights into Heathrow and two other airports after the
High Court ruled that the manner of their introduction had been illegal.
A judge ruled that Mr John MacGregor, the former transport secretary, had
acted unlawfully in failing to provide proper public consultation over the
latest controls on night-time take-offs and landings at Heathrow, Gatwick
and Stansted.
The judge said a consultation paper issued by the Department of Transport in
January last year was misleading because it did not make clear that the new
arrangements would mean an increase in noise levels at Heathrow.
The ruling was welcomed by the local authorities which brought the court
action against the department. Mr Richard Buxton, the authorities'
solicitor, said the ruling would force the government to reconsider its
current quota system for night flights.
'Seldom is a government department found by the courts to have misled so
many people over such an important environmental issue. The government
essentially has to go back to square one,' he said.
The department was given leave to appeal over the ruling. A spokesman said
the judgment would be studied carefully before a decision was taken over the
appropriate response. However, he said the controls would remain in place
until March 26 next year.
Although ministers were yesterday digesting the detail of the judgment,
officials conceded that a fresh round of consultations was now inevitable.
The consultation paper published in last year stated that under the proposed
controls noise levels would not exceed those for summer 1988.
However, this ignored the fact that the actual noise levels for 1988 were
two-thirds of levels allowed for in theory under controls in place at the
time.
Mr Justice Latham said: 'I do not consider that consultation based upon a
document which can mislead in this way can be described as full and fair
consultation in the sense that (local authorities) could legitimately
expect.'
The controls phased in this winter are based on a mixture of a quota system
intended to encourage greater use of quieter aeroplanes and a ceiling on the
number of individual flights. It was intended these controls would apply
until summer 1998.
The successful legal challenge was brought by the borough councils of
Windsor and Maidenhead, Hounslow, Hillingdon, Richmond and Slough, and
Surrey County Council.
The department is expected to draw up new night flight regulations to cover
next summer's flights.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Passengers to be compensated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cunard said yesterday that passengers unable to travel on the QE2's
Christmas cruise could take two cruises next year, should they want to, Neil
Buckley writes.
The 490 passengers were offered a full refund by Christmas, plus a free
transatlantic cruise of equivalent value next year with Pounds 250 spending
money. They could combine the free offer with their refund to upgrade their
tickets next year, or even take two trips.
Meanwhile, 158 passengers who were to have flown to New York to join the
ship for a Caribbean cruise have been told not to go because their cabins
will not be ready in time. Cunard said the bad weather had prevented
sub-contractors from working.
Cunard could not give a figure for the likely total cost of compensation,
but said a mooted Pounds 2.5m was 'the product of someone's imagination'.
But with tickets for the transatlantic crossing ranging from Pounds 595 to
Pounds 5,000, the cost of refunds plus free tickets for 490 will be
considerable.
Cunard may face further complaints from some of the 600 passengers on board
the liner. About 50 passengers were reported to have formed an action group.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Cunard blames QE2 delay on contractors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cunard, the cruise operator, yesterday blamed subcontractors for the delayed
completion of a Pounds 30m refit of the liner Queen Elizabeth 2, which
resulted in 500 passengers being turned away from its Christmas cruise.
The company said the refit, which involved the refurbishment of all 960
cabins and the building of many facilities in 30 days, was 'the biggest ever
undertaken in such a short time'. But Cunard denied being over-ambitious.
It said: 'All the contractors knew what we were undertaking and were
prepared to tender for it. They convinced us they could finish on time and
that was why they got the contracts.'
Cunard emphasised that of more than 50 contractors, only 'about three'
British companies - which it refused to name - had not finished on time.
About 57 per cent of refitting work by value went to British companies, the
rest to German and other international groups.
Passengers have complained that the liner resembled a 'building site', with
plumbing not functioning in many cabins and equipment strewn across public
areas.
Captain Ron Warwick of the QE2 told Cunard yesterday, however, that more
cabins were constantly being opened, allowing passengers to move into better
accommodation.
The main refit contract, involving structural work inside the ship, was
awarded to Blohm &amp; Voss, the Hamburg-based shipbuilder. It said it had
completed the work on time but cabin work had been subcontracted to UK
companies by Cunard.
Cunard said it received assurances from subcontractors that the refit would
be finished on time. But it became apparent on Friday that insufficient
cabins would be ready for Saturday's departure.
Subcontractors yesterday refused to comment on specific causes of the delay.
Trimline, the Hampshire-based company named as one of the companies which
was late, confirmed it was talking to Cunard about the contract.
A company executive said he was 'extremely brassed off' at suggestions that
the company had been at fault. Trimline had been refitting more than 700
bathrooms on the QE2 and started work in July. He said: 'We were never
running late, and are confident the work will be finished on time, hopefully
by the time the ship reaches New York.'
He said Trimline depended on other companies finishing their work before it
could refit the bathrooms, and 'unforeseen events' over which Trimline had
no control were to blame for the delay.
One shipbuilding industry official said the timetable for the refit was
'very, very tight'.

The Writs Response Group, which represents Lloyd's members resisting legal

The former managing director of Resort Hotels, Mr Robert Feld, was charged
yesterday with 16 offences after a Serious Fraud Office inquiry into the
company.
The charges relate to financial information published about the hotel
company's Pounds 20m rights issue in April 1992 and a preliminary
announcement of its profits for 1991-92.
Mr Feld, of Rottingdean, Sussex, was charged at Brighton magistrates court
with three offences under the Financial Services Act and 13 offences under
the Forgery Act.
At the company's request the Stock Exchange suspended trading in Resort
Hotels shares in July 1993. The company has since sold most of its business

Companies House is based in Cardiff and has five regional offices. Last year

Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said in a written

FT  21 DEC 94 / Gloomy view of housing market despite loan rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rise in new lending by building societies in November was a sign of
increasing market share rather than a housing recovery, the Building
Societies Association said yesterday.
In a pessimistic assessment of the housing market, the association said
prospects were still bleak and that the market was likely to remain subdued
for some time.
The comments came as the association published statistics showing that both
gross net new lending last month was higher than in November last year, and
also higher than in October.
The figures also showed a net inflow of retail savings for the fifth month
running. The total of Pounds 301m was the highest for November since 1988.
Savings usually fall before Christmas as people withdraw money for festive
spending.
However, Mr Adrian Coles, director-general, said the strong savings figures
could be explained by weak retail sales, the rise in interest rates since
the start of the year, and pre-Budget consumer caution.
'The pattern may not be continued in December if consumers have delayed
Christmas shopping in order to pick up last-minute bargains,' he said.
Mr Coles said underlying factors such as low consumer confidence still
pointed to a very weak mortgage market.
New net lending was almost 30 per cent higher in November, at Pounds 1.02bn
compared with Pounds 788m the previous month and Pounds 880m in November
1993.
New gross lending was Pounds 3.07bn in November - against Pounds 2.79bn in
the same month last year, and Pounds 2.91bn in October.
Net new commitments - loans agreed but not yet undertaken - rose by 13 per
cent to total Pounds 3.19bn last month compared with Pounds 2.81bn in
October.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Banking regulator urged for societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The regulation of building societies should be amalgamated into banking
supervision instead of being left to a separate body, a Commons committee
recommended yesterday.
A report from the Treasury committee of MPs said that the Building Societies
Commission could be absorbed into the supervisory division of the Bank of
England.
It called for building societies to be able to undertake a broader range of
activities, limited only by what their members decided and what their
supervisor said was prudent, but also to be more accountable to their
members.
The committee argued that the case for a single regulator grew stronger as
societies diversified more widely into financial services.
It said: 'There may be a point at which the expanding activities of the
larger societies will require the supervisory disciplines of Bank of England
scrutiny.'
The MPs also highlighted advantages in changing the law to allow societies
to become banks while retaining their mutual status.
They said the government should consult the Bank of England about developing
this option as an alternative route for societies that wanted wider powers.
The report has been timed to be taken into account by the Treasury's own
review of societies' powers and accountability, which is expected to be
published in mid-January.
As mutual organisations, societies are owned by their millions of members
rather than by a separate category of shareholders. The MPs criticised
societies, saying there was evidence they had 'tended to take their members
for granted', and put forward some specific changes to improve involvement
and accountability.
The report dismissed the arguments advanced by societies against paying
dividends or loyalty bonuses, and said the organisations should be compelled
to be more open with members about accumulated reserves, and should consider
the scope for such payments.
It called for greater use of postal voting and for further work on making it
easier for members to nominate directors. The idea of mutuality was 'under
strain from the transformation of regional deposit-taking and
mortgage-lending bodies into national multi-faceted financial
organisations'.
The committee's backing for a more permissive legislative regime and ways of
making societies more accountable to members - such as by distributing
'user-friendly' leaflets about membership rights to all members - is in line
with thinking in the Treasury review.
However, if societies are to be given wider powers anyway, the government is
much less likely to favour creating a class of mutual banks.
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, advocated this idea, but has
since announced plans to become a public limited company with a full banking
licence after merging with Leeds Permanent Building Society.

The Jamaican government has taken over one of the island's banks because of
dissatisfaction with its operations. Auditors will run the Blaise Trust and
Merchant Bank for an unspecified period, according to Mr Omar Davies,
finance minister.
There were no indications of the nature of the government's concern. The
finance ministry had contemplated taking over the bank earlier this year,
but delayed its move then after the management was changed. Mr Davies said
that 'new information' on the bank's operations led to the takeover.

A man was shot by security guards outside the White House yesterday, after
he was seen waving a knife, witnesses said.
The US Secret Service confirmed that a US Park policeman shot a man after he
had threatened the officer with a knife on the pavement in front of the
north side of the White House, on Pennsylvania Avenue. Secret Service
spokesman Carl Meyers described the man's condition as 'real bad.'
This was the third shooting incident near the executive mansion in less than
two months. In late October, a Colorado man sprayed the front of the White
House with semi-automatic gunfire and was later charged with attempting to
assassinate the president.

PepsiCo won an unusual court injunction in the US yesterday, preventing a
former senior executive from divulging information about the company to its
rival Quaker Oats.
Mr William Redmond, a general manager of Pepsi's beverages division before
he left in mid-November, has also been barred by the federal court from
taking any part in decisions about the pricing, marketing and distribution
of soft drinks at Quaker for the next six months.
Pepsi said it held no evidence that Mr Redmond had divulged commercially
sensitive information, but the company claimed that his having worked on
PepsiCo's planning and strategy meant he was in possession of highly
sensitive information.

FT  21 DEC 94 / US trade deficit up in October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US trade deficit rose to Dollars 10.1bn (Pounds 6.5bn) in October, from
a revised Dollars 9.4bn in September, roughly in line with market
projections. The deficit for the first 10 months rose to Dollars 90.5bn, a
42 per cent increase from the equivalent period last year.
The increase last month reflected a 0.8 per cent increase in imports and an
erratic 0.6 per cent decline in exports, caused partly by a decline in
exports of civilian aircraft. A deficit of Dollars 15bn on trade in goods
was partially offset by a Dollars 4.9bn surplus on trade in services.
There are signs, however, that the deficit is beginning to level off as
economic growth accelerates in Europe and Japan, boosting demand for US
exports. Averaged over three-month periods, the deficit has been stable at
Dollars 9.5bn-Dollars 10bn since June. Many economists expect the deficit to
contract next year, given the weakness of the dollar and the likelihood of
slower US growth.
The geographical distribution of the deficit remains a source of tension in
Washington. Last month, the merchandise deficit with Japan rose to Dollars
6.7bn from Dollars 5.4bn. The overall merchandise deficit with Pacific Rim
countries rose to Dollars 12.6bn, against Dollars 10.9bn.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Poverty in Latin America 'outweighing growth'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Latin America has shown signs of a new economic dynamism this year, but
current rates of growth remain remain insufficient to have much impact on
the region's poverty levels, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean says today.
In its annual preliminary economic overview, Eclac says regional growth this
year rose to 3.7 per cent, from 3.2 per cent last year. Average regional
inflation - excluding Brazil, whose inflation rate has fallen substantially
in the second half - fell to 16 per cent, from 19 per cent last year.
The 1994 growth performance was the second strongest in 14 years, and
resulted in per capita growth of 1.9 per cent. Despite this, the commission
said: 'Growth rates of less than 4 per cent are not enough to allow great
advances in the fight against poverty, nor to prevent unemployment and
underemployment from remaining unacceptably high.'
Growth rates in Latin America had converged over recent years. Only three
economies - Guyana, Argentina and Peru - grew by more than than 5 per cent
this year, with Peru expanding by 11 per cent. Three contracted: Haiti by 6
per cent, Venezuela by 4 per cent, and Honduras.
Imports rose by 15 per cent this year to Dollars 171bn (Pounds 110bn), after
growth of 8 per cent in 1993, with imports growing fastest in Peru (36 per
cent), Argentina and Brazil (25 per cent each). But exports rose by 14 per
cent, after 5 per cent growth in 1993, to Dollars 153bn. This was helped by
increases in prices of non-fuel raw materials, for the first time since
1989, and by an 8 per cent expansion in export volumes.
The regional trade deficit grew from Dollars 15bn to Dollars 18bn, and the
current account deficit rose from Dollars 46bn to Dollars 50bn, with
increasing debt servicing and other factor payments also contributing.
This was more than covered by capital inflows of an estimated Dollars 57bn,
down from Dollars 65bn in 1993. Episodes of capital flight in Mexico and
Venezuela 'did not have repercussions in other countries,' Eclac notes.
The region accumulated hard currency reserves of a further Dollars 7bn in
1994, against a Dollars 20bn increase in 1993, despite falls of Dollars 9bn
in Mexico's reserves and Dollars 4.5bn in Venezuela's.
Of the Dollars 57bn of inflows this year, Dollars 17bn came through bond
issues, a sharp reduction on 1993, about Dollars 5bn through the issue of
shares in foreign markets, and an estimated Dollars 15bn in foreign direct
investment.
The region's debt rose 5.8 per cent to Dollars 534bn, despite Brady debt
reduction deals for Brazil, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic. But, because
of the rise in exports, the region's debt-to-export ratio fell from 302 per
cent to 280 per cent, the lowest level since the start of the debt crisis.

FT  21 DEC 94 / Nervous over deficit and dissidence: Stephen Fidler and Ted
Bardacke assess the devaluation yesterday of the Mexican currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the end, something had to give in order to break Mexico's vicious
economic circle. What gave was the exchange rate. The government of
President Ernesto Zedillo, which took office on December 1, yesterday
oversaw the first one-step devaluation of the Mexican peso since December
15, 1987.
There is no guarantee, though, that the step, a surprise to many foreign
investors, will take the economic pressure off Mr Zedillo's government.
His conundrum was this: the exchange rate, used for six years as a tool to
fight against inflation, had become increasingly overvalued. This
contributed to a current account deficit that, this year, is expected to
exceed Dollars 28bn (Pounds 17.9bn), 8 per cent of gross domestic product.
To sustain the capital inflows to finance the deficit demanded higher and
higher interest rates, which was slowing the economy. Worries about an
economic slowdown made foreign investors even more wary about Mexican risk.
Their concerns were heightened - intensifying capital flight - during the
last couple of weeks as political tensions in the southern state of Chiapas
mounted.
Also, if the conflict in Chiapas were to become more intense, speculative
pressure could have become overwhelming. The government may have judged it
better to act now, than to move in panic later.
The move yesterday formally lowered the floor of the peso by 15 per cent.
The permitted daily slide remains unchanged, which suggests a further
possible 4 per cent depreciation of the floor over a year.
The peso fell close to its new floor yesterday,which, together with 10 per
cent depreciation of the currency seen earlier in the year, means a peso
fall this year of close to 25 per cent.
However, government officials said, the peso was likely to revalue once
Chiapas calmed down, which should be in a matter of weeks. 'We ran into a
problem of expectations. If you look at the macro numbers, we are doing just
fine. But, with Chiapas, there was a lot of pressure and there was no way to
keep resisting it,' said one.
Reactions yesterday were divided. Mr Rudiger Dornbusch, economics professor
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, who has long
advocated a devaluation, said: 'For Mexico, this is sheer liberation. They
have been living a big lie. With rising interest rates, rising
non-performing loans at banks and a growing current account deficit, it
could not go on.'
But Mr Geoffrey Dennis at Bear Stearns, the New York brokerage which until
Monday was advising clients that they should believe the government's stated
no-devaluation policy, said that the move 'had created a major long-term
problem of credibility for the Mexican government.'
Investor reaction was seen as critical because Mexico's financing
requirement will remain large next year. Devaluation should bring down the
current account deficit by spurring exports, but it will not come down very
quickly and could still be Dollars 25bn.
Mr Dornbusch said that now was the time for 'smart money' to move into
Mexico, with the currency at appropriate levels. But some stock market
analysts said the devaluation would be successful only if seen as a unique
event, rather than the first of a series.
'If confidence in the currency is restored, then interest rates ought to
fall, investment will increase and economic growth be very strong next
year,' said one analyst. 'But, if the markets don't react well, it could be
the beginning of a long downward spiral.'
If confidence is maintained, most economists said, short-term peso interest
rates - which on Monday rose above 20 per cent - will fall. While the
decline will be limited by expected further rises in US interest rates, it
should benefit smaller companies which have been unable to borrow in dollars
and whose growth has been particularly hurt by current policy.
The main risk is inflation. Mexico is now considered unlikely to reach its
target of 4 per cent annual inflation for 1995 - inflation this year is
estimated at 6.9 per cent - which prospect is fuelling worries that the
benefits of economic growth will be erased by spiraling prices.
The key economic variable in the medium term will be the behaviour of wages.
If the government succeeds in keeping down pay increases, the new strategy
will be sustainable. If wages start to rise - and the agreement which the
government secured with the trade unions and businesses early yesterday
morning should help counteract this - the gain for Mexican competitiveness
will be lost in higher prices.
While sharp devaluations of European currencies in 1991-92 did not increase
wage pressures, economists point out that it is hard to find as many
beneficiaries from devaluation in Mexico's relatively closed economy (trade
accounts for some 15 per cent of GDP) as in the more open European ones.
Devaluation will be unpopular among the Mexican middle class, whose sense of
well-being is tied more closely to the price of US imports than to interest
rates. The immediate impact on big Mexican companies, most carrying a heavy
load of dollar debts, is also likely to be negative.
Companies such as Telmex, Cemex, Televisa, and Aeromexico were hit hard by
exchange write-downs in the first quarter of 1994, when the peso fell by
nearly 10 per cent. With the new devaluation before the end of the year,
1994 profits will take an even bigger hit.
The Mexican stock market, however, generally reacted positively to the news
yesterday. Prospects for lower interest rates, renewed confidence in the
peso and faster growth should help the market, the analysts said.
Even so, the currency move is an abrupt change of tack for Mr Zedillo, after
pledging that he would continue the economic policies pursued by the
administration of President Carlos Salinas, which ended only 20 days ago.
Foreign investors, not to speak of many Mexicans, will be wondering how firm
Mr Zedillo's other policy pledges are.
