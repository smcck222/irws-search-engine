FT  28 OCT 94 / Criticism prompts watchdog to probe tax laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has set up an independent watchdog to
scrutinise Britain's tax system in response to growing public concern about
the efficiency and complexity of recent tax legislation.
The Tax Law Review Committee - financed by the Bank of England, clearing
banks, leading public companies and City law and accountancy firms - will
examine existing and prospective tax laws to see whether the system is
working as intended.
Lord Howe, the former Conservative foreign secretary and chancellor, will be
president of the committee. Mr Graham Aaronson QC, a leading tax barrister,
will be its chairman.
The institute said that the form and incomprehensibility of recent finance
acts had produced a barrage of criticism.
It said that the volume of tax legislation had grown dramatically. The 1993
and 1994 finance acts contained more legislation than that produced in the
whole of Baroness (then Mrs) Thatcher's first government. Yet parliament had
limited time, resources and ability to consider it.
Although the government consulted extensively about tax changes, there was
still a perception that the tax system did not get any better.
The institute said: 'The system is regarded as being in a mess. Mistakes
abound. The burden on taxpayers and businesses gets ever greater.'
Mr Aaronson said yesterday that the committee had received encouragement and
support from the Bank, Treasury ministers and revenue departments and he was
confident they would take note of its recommendations.
The committee has members from the main political parties. and the
judiciary. The remaining members are drawn from commerce and industry,
government service, the professions or are academics.
It holds its inaugural meeting today and will be funded for an initial three
years.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Review of exam gradings to go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ron Dearing, the government's chief adviser on the school curriculum,
yesterday received approval for a sweeping review of the system for grading
GCSE exams, taken by all 16-year-olds in England and Wales.
He has unveiled a range of measures to be implemented by the end of this
year, when the next GCSEs are to be taken, and is also examining more
radical measures for the future.
The immediate measures are:
Ensuring that the rules for determining grades are clear, consistent and
robust.
Improving communications between examining groups.
Producing national sets of candidates' work to help define grade standards
in key subjects.
Introducing piloting of any important changes to awarding schemes.
Sir Ron was given leave to investigate GCSE marking by Mrs Gillian Shephard,
the education secretary, after discrepancies emerged in the marks required
to gain 'B' and 'C' grades in mathematics and science.
There is no question of retrospectively altering candidates' marks as a
result of this investigation.
Sir Ron suggested that in the longer term a national archive of GCSE papers
should be set up to guarantee greater consistency in marking between
examination boards.
The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, chaired by Sir Ron, appears
anxious that there may be too many examining boards. Since GCSEs were
introduced in 1988 the government has added the requirement that they test
the national curriculum for 14-to-16-year-olds, and more standardisation of
different boards' syllabuses may now be required.
Sir Ron suggested that exam groups could work together to produce a smaller
number of syllabuses and share some papers.
The Southern Examining Group - one whose results showed a change in the
proportion of B and C grades in maths and science - said: 'We already have
the most closely monitored exam system in the world.'
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's new education spokesman, said it was 'critically
important for the credibility of our examination system' that discrepancies
between exam boards were ironed out.
He urged Mrs Shephard to 'restore commonsense' by doing away with the
'A-starred grade' for the highest achievers, which was introduced by Mr John
Patten, her predecessor.
He said: 'Parents, employers and pupils want grades they can understand. An
A is an A and a B is a B, and we must stop undermining achievement by
complicating the issue with A-starred grades.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / Views sought on rail access charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Swift QC, the rail industry regulator, yesterday asked the railway
freight industry for its views on how track access charges should be
negotiated with Railtrack.
He outlined in a consultation document his own proposals to allow the two
sides to negotiate commercial rates while at the same time setting limits on
charges to companies with no alternative.
As part of the privatisation of British Rail train operations and track
ownership have been split and train operators pay Railtrack depending on the
number and type of trains that they run.
In a departure from his earlier proposals for passenger train operators, Mr
Swift said there was no clear case for requiring Railtrack to reduce charges
to freight operators by a formula based on the retail price index minus a
particular figure. Commercial pressures should ensure that Railtrack passed
on any cost savings, he said.
He proposed a method of calculating appropriate cost 'floors' and price
ceilings which would allow Railtrack to cover its costs but not penalise
customers. 'Railtrack's current approach to calculating ceilings may not
provide users with adequate protection against excessive charges,' he
warned.
The regulator said he would require Railtrack to publish more information
about its freight business so that he could see whether his guidance had
been followed.
Responses to the consultation document are required by November 25.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Mint canvasses views on Pounds 2 coin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 2 coin and a smaller, lighter and re-shaped 50p coin could be in
circulation in less than three years if the public wants them.
The Royal Mint yesterday launched a consultation programme on a Pounds 2
coin and changes to the 50p coin.
More than 1,000 organisations representing the main handlers of coins, such
as banks, the retailing and vending industry and special interest groups for
the blind and elderly, have been invited to comment on several options.
Opinions are being sought on the possibility of withdrawing the 50p and 2p
coins.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, asked the Royal Mint in May
to conduct the review. The Mint has produced sample coins to gauge public
reaction.
The idea of a streamlined 50p coin arose after the introduction of smaller
and lighter 5p and 10p coins.
In the consultation document, which sets out arguments for and against a
Pounds 2 coin, two alternatives for the new denomination are introduced. The
Mint is considering either a bi-metal or single metal coin. Either version
would be bigger than the Pounds 1 coin, but thinner and lighter.
Options for the 50p coin are a smaller version of the seven-sided coin, a
smaller, rounded coin, or retaining the coin in its present form.
Mr Roger Holmes, chief executive of the Royal Mint, said: 'The 50p coin is
simply the heaviest coin in Europe and uses the most metal. But we are not
making any proposals about it or the Pounds 2 coin as such. We are just
looking to see what the public wants.'
The consultation period will run to the end of the year, and a decision is
not expected until next spring. If a change were decided on, new coins would
be in circulation by 1997.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Bidders join Channel 5 licence queue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission will formally advertise the licence
for Channel 5 on Tuesday as interest appears to be growing in a service that
has taken years to get off the ground.
The ITC confirmed yesterday that it would have to advertise two separate
propositions for the channel - one which would reach just over half the UK
population, and the other nearly three-quarters.
The reason for the uncertainty is that the ITC is still applying for
international permission to use extra frequencies for Channel 5. The new
permissions are necessary because the government set aside frequencies
previously allotted for the new channel for the possible future development
of digital terrestrial television.
But in spite of the uncertainty there is considerable interest. Mr Izzy
Asper, chairman and chief executive of CanWest Global Communications, the
Canadian broadcaster with television interests in New Zealand, Australia and
Chile, said he would bid for the channel 'as long as there are no nasty
surprises' in next week's ITC announcement.
Mr Asper, who has been negotiating with a number of big UK media and leisure
companies, would plan to broadcast a high proportion of British-made
programmes if he won the Channel 5 franchise. CanWest usually works closely
with independent producers - allowing them to retain international
distribution rights to their programmes.
White Rose, the consortium that tried to unseat Yorkshire Television in the
last ITV franchise round, is also interested in bidding.
Mr William Lewisham, a director of White Rose, a consortium which includes
RTE, the Irish national broadcaster, and City financial interests, said
yesterday that the prospects were interesting as long as the channel could
reach more than 60 per cent of the population.
Mr Ward Thomas, the chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, has found
considerable interest in the channel from potential US partners.
The other big groups expressing interest range from Channel 5 Broadcasting,
which brings together Time Warner, MAI and Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, a grouping led by NBC, the US network, and Mr Richard Branson's
Virgin Group.
But the number of bids will probably depend on the fine print of the ITC
document and how optimistic Sir George Russell, the ITC chairman, is about
getting permission to use new frequencies.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Reform urged to cut delay in judicial reviews
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Commission yester-day called for reforms to cut delays in handling
legal challenges to government decisions.
The government's law reform body said the number of applications for
judicial review of the decisions of public bodies had risen so dramatically
that delays of up to two years in hearing them were not uncommon.
Judicial review applications have risen from 160 in 1974 to 1,500 by 1987
and almost 2,900 last year. The rise has continued this year, with 1,851
applications in the first seven months compared with 1,728 in the same
period of last year.
The commission said that if delays in hearing legal challenges were to be
reduced procedures for judicial review would have to be streamlined.
It is proposing several changes to make procedures easier for applicants.
The terms and remedies available will be changed to make their function and
purpose more easily understood.
The first stage of judicial review will be called the 'preliminary
consideration' rather than the stage where the applicant applies to a single
High Court judge for 'leave' to bring a judicial review.
The commission also recommends for the first time that courts hearing public
law cases should have the power to order restitution where organisations or
individuals have wrongly been required to pay out money - for example, tax
demands which are found to be unlawful.
Rules on time limits, the availability of interim remedies pending a full
hearing - in particular against ministers and central government departments
 -and rules on appeals, all needed clarifying and updating, it said.
It recommended that to cut costs and speed up the process most applications
should in the first place be dealt with by a judge on paper, without a court
hearing.
The rules of judicial review should also make it clear that public interest
groups as well as individuals adversely affected by administrative decisions
should be able to apply for judicial review.
The commission said that the purpose of judicial review was to keep the
powers of government within their legal bounds and compel public authorities
to perform their duties. An effective system for judicial review helped to
correct maladministration and to promote good administration.
Mr Justice Brooke, chairman of the commission, said that he hoped its
recommendations would lead to 'further improvements in the way that citizens
may have access to the courts when they seek to ensure that public bodies
act lawfully, fairly and rationally'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Council finance rules to be eased
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government is to relax rules governing the handling of local authority
capital assets in a move that may foreshadow further steps to loosen
Whitehall's grip on local government finances.
Ministers are expected to act soon to change regulations dictating the
proportion of newly acquired capital assets which local authorities must use
to redeem outstanding debts.
They may also relax restrictions on the maximum term over which councils are
permitted to take out leases.
The likely move follows consultations between the government and local
authorities on perceived obstacles to partnerships with the private sector.
It will be part of the private finance initiative, designed to mobilise the
private sector to meet needs traditionally met by the public services.
Under the proposals authorities contributing capital assets such as land to
joint ventures with private companies would no longer be required at the
outset to redeem debt equivalent to 50 per cent of the value of the assets.
In addition, a rule requiring councils to set aside 75 per cent of what they
receive on selling the assets in question would be relaxed, with a new 50
per cent level possibly applying.
Some ministers are known to favour a further loosening of central government
controls over local authorities.

FT  28 OCT 94 / George sees fair inflation outlook: Bank chief says markets
are too pessimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets are too pessimistic in their outlook on inflation,
according to Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England.
Speaking first to a financial markets conference in London, and later to a
group of businessmen in Birmingham, Mr George stressed the message that
markets, both in the UK and overseas, were exaggerating the inflationary
threat, and the likely interest rate rises needed to combat it.
He said: 'There are a number of reasons for supposing that the effect of the
economic expansion on inflation could be less in the present upswing than it
has been in the past.'
Analysts said the governor's comments suggested that the Bank's quarterly
inflation report, to be released next Tuesday, was unlikely to contain any
surprises about inflation pressures in the economy.
The likelihood of a rise in interest rates after the monthly monetary
meeting between the governor and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, next
Wednesday would also appear to be reduced.
Mr George lent substance to this view in his Birmingham speech, delivered
last night. He said: 'There are relatively few immediate signs that
inflation is about to pick up strongly.' He stopped short, however, of
ruling out another increase in rates.
Short sterling futures, which reflect the market's view on prospective
interest rates, firmed yesterday, showing less pessimism about the extent to
which rates would have to rise.
The governor received some support from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
He told parliament during question time: 'We will be able to keep interest
rates down . . . if we act in good time, if our fiscal policy is sound, and
if we keep on the course that we have now set.'
Mr George's speeches trod a careful line between stressing the Bank's
willingness to act early to curb inflationary pressures - as it had done by
raising rates last month - while also making clear that the markets were too
bearish in their inflation outlook.
In his London speech the governor spent some time addressing the issue of
why global bond yields had risen so far this year. He concluded that the
'most important influence' had been the increasing evidence of recovery and
expansion in the industrial world.
Mr George said the run-up in bond yields - by between 1.5 per cent and 1.75
per cent in the US, Germany and the UK, from a year previously - reflected
increasing uncertainty and worsening inflationary expectations.
He said there were a number of reasons to believe these were exaggerated.
These included: a global consensus on the need to achieve monetary stability
and to curb fiscal deficits; the fact that real interest rates were already
quite high; little upward pressure on labour costs; and the intensity of
business competition.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Political Notebook: A forgotten war in the Balkans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sleaze, ministerial resignations, more sleaze. Post Office privatisation,
Europe. The odd MP is even thinking ahead to Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget. The
one thing no one at Westminster is talking about is Bosnia.
The conflict has slipped from the front to foreign news pages. Television
news programmes have become bored with images from a still-besieged but, in
Bosnian terms, half-normal Sarejevo.
The soon-to-depart General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of the
United Nations forces, merits still the occasional radio interview. But the
average MP has forgotten that 3,500 British troops are spending a third
winter helping to keep the fragile peace in the former Yugoslav province.
Across the road from the House of Commons at the Foreign Office there are
different priorities. For two months now, Bosnia has been Mr Douglas Hurd's
principal preoccupation - so much so that he occasionally asks himself
whether it has become an unhealthy obsession.
It has not. A few weeks ago Mr Hurd feared the biggest rift in
Anglo-American relations since Suez. The prospect was removed, but only
temporarily, by the Moslem Bosnian government's decision to suspend until
next spring its demand for the UN to lift the international arms embargo.
Had it not done so, Washington would have forced a vote in the security
council. London would have abstained and, assuming the embargo was lifted,
would have ordered an immediate withdrawal of British troops. The French
would have done likewise. The five-nation contract, which includes also
Russia and Germany, would have fractured.
Britain still expects a confrontation in the security council. President
Bill Clinton is expected within the next day or so to meet his long-standing
commitment to Congress by tabling a UN resolution which would set a firm
spring deadline for the removal of the arms embargo.
London and Paris will not support such 'automaticity'. The two governments
will go no further than the existing wording of the contact group that
lifting the embargo may at some indeterminate stage be 'unavoidable'.
Mr Hurd's expectation is that the clash will be containable. If he goes
ahead Mr Clinton will have met his obligation to Congress by framing a
strong motion in support of the Bosnian Moslems. But, on British
calculations, the motion will not gain the necessary nine votes to get
through the security council.
The hope is that honour will thus be satisfied. And the contact group will
have six months grace to try to persuade, or rather coerce, the Bosnian
Serbs into a comprehensive settlement.
Viewed from the Foreign Office such a deal looks possible. Mr Hurd wants
other elements - including for example confirmation of the Serb-Croat border
and protection for the Serb enclaves in Croatia - drawn into the
negotiations. That would increase at least the number of cards on the table.
But to say a deal is probable would be to stretch the point. When pressed,
the British will admit that success or failure will depend not on any new
maps but on whether - and how quickly - President Miloslevic of Serbia wins
his power struggle with the Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic.
The contact group has been told by the Russians that if the blockade imposed
by President Miloslevic was watertight, then the Bosnian Serbs' key supplies
would be exhausted within two months. But it is not watertight. All sorts of
people - including Moslems and Croatians - are willing apparently to supply
Mr Karadzic's army if the price is high enough.
Britain does not have the most creditable record over the break-up of the
former Yugoslavia. At the outset it was too eager to please Germany's
Chancellor Helmut Kohl by giving recognition to Croatia.
It insisted that sanctions were the best method against the Serbian forces
which overran a large part of Bosnia, but never did enough to ensure that
they worked. It was too dismissive of President Clinton's determination last
year to inject a moral dimension into the west's approach.
Now the unity of the western alliance depends on a Serbian president
defeating a Bosnian Serb warlord. If the latter holds on, the arms embargo
probably will be lifted next spring. In those circumstances the UN forces
will be withdrawn in a scramble. Bosnia, in the words of one member of the
British cabinet, will then go the way of Somalia. Everyone will blame
everyone else.
But Bosnia is not Somalia. History as well as geography tells us that. It is
in Europe's backyard. It is the fuse which could ignite wider conflagration
in the Balkans and explode the precarious attempts to build a post-Communist
international order.
So Mr Hurd is right to be preoccupied. And some time soon others at
Westminster may again start taking an interest in Bosnia's forgotten
conflict.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Labour hit by frontbench shake-up row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last stage of Mr Tony Blair's shake-up of Labour's frontbench team is
being delayed by a row about his plans to restructure the whips' office.
Mr Blair was expected to complete his new line-up yesterday by announcing
the names of several appointments to the whips' office from the 1992 intake
of Labour MPs.
But the announcement had to be cancelled after Mr Don Dixon, the deputy
chief whip, complained that he had not been consulted.
Mr Dixon, who apparently discovered the proposed changes by accident, has
demanded time to consider Mr Blair's proposals and is not expected to
respond until Monday.
He said last night: 'I am pleased that the whips' office is getting more
recognition and more people. But I am not pleased about the fact that I was
not consulted about what is happening.'
Mr Dixon, the MP for Jarrow, is in a strong position to defy Mr Blair
because he is an elected official of the parliamentary Labour party. He
cannot be sacked or moved against his wishes. Regarded as a consummate
backstairs 'fixer', Mr Dixon has been elected deputy chief whip every year
since 1987, reflecting his popularity among Labour MPs.
The dispute is unlikely to prevent Mr Blair from pushing through the bulk of
his planned shake-up, which is intended to give the whips' office a fresh
role as a training ground for promising MPs.
However, a senior Labour MP said that the clash with Mr Dixon was likely to
be seen as further evidence of the inexperience of Mr Blair's close
advisers, many of whom have little experience of Westminster.
The Labour party's popularity has risen to its highest level ever, according
to an opinion poll published in The Times newspaper today.
The poll, conducted by MORI last weekend, puts Labour's rating at 57 per
cent, up from 54 per cent in late September. The Conservatives remain
unchanged at 25 per cent and the Liberal Democrats are down to 14 per cent
from a previous 17 per cent.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Complex web of Saudi interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanging over a door in Mr Jonathan Aitken's Westminster house are a
ceremonial sword and dagger, a gift to him from King Khalid of Saudi Arabia
before he was appointed chief secretary to the Treasury.
The gift symbolises the extensive and complex range of Saudi-connected
business interests Mr Aitken built up before he joined the government,
beginning with his time in the early 1970s as managing director of the
Middle Eastern operations of the property and banking group Slater Walker,
which collapsed in 1975.
After Mr Aitken disclosed on Wednesday night that he too had been
interviewed by Sir Robin Butler in the cabinet secretary's probe of alleged
ministerial improprieties, his extensive business interests have fallen
under the spotlight.
His most prominent role has been as chairman of Aitken Hume, the fund
management and banking group he set up with his cousin Timothy in 1981. Four
years after its formation the group paid Pounds 16.5m for Sentinel Insurance
Company, a life assurance group.
About 60 per cent of Sentinel's shares were held by accountants Price
Waterhouse as liquidator for the Israel-British Bank (London) which
collapsed in 1974 with its Israeli parent company, the Israeli-British Bank
of Tel Aviv, with a combined deficit of about Pounds 60m.
The remaining shares in Sentinel were largely held by relatives of Mr Harry
Landy, chairman of the Israel-British Bank and of Sentinel.
Mr Landy was also a director of a Lonrho subsidiary during the House of
Fraser battle.
Following Aitken Humes's purchase of Sentinel, Mr Wafic Said, a wealthy
Syrian-born businessman, became a major shareholder in the company.
Mr Aitken's declaration in the register of MPs' interests for 1989 listed a
number of business interests. At the time he declared his chairmanship of
Aitken Hume, a directorship of Al Bilad (UK) Limited, a directorship of
TV-am, a directorship of Beaverbrook Investments and a directorship of BMARC
(the British Manufacturer and Research Company), which was a subsidiary of
the now defunct arms company, Astra.
Al Bilad (UK) Ltd is described in the register as a subsidiary of a foreign
parent company which receives payments from contracts with Saudi Arabian
royal family interests and government agencies.
In March 1988 Mr Aitken's Saudi connections forced him to resign from the
board of TV-am when it emerged that he had failed to disclose a Saudi royal
family interest in Beaverbrook Investments, the company through which he
held his position.
In the House of Commons he has shown some interest in the House of Fraser
affair.
During a House of Commons debate on publication of the Department of Trade
and Industry report on the House of Fraser in April 1989, Mr Aitken asked Mr
Anthony Newton, then minister of trade and industry, to confirm that Lord
Young, the trade and industry Secretary, 'has an unfettered discretion to
publish the report'.
He asked if it was 'wise for Lord Young to rely yesterday in the House of
Lords on the statement that the prosecuting authorities would have to stop
their inquiries if the report was published'.
He concluded by stating: 'Are we not in some confusion and in danger of
entering into a second 'Carry On, Spycatcher' saga?'

FT  28 OCT 94 / Rumbold quits lobbying directorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dame Angela Rumbold, the deputy chairman of the Tory party, last night
resigned as executive director of a political lobbying company, amid
allegations that it had been involved in negotiations over the channel
tunnel rail link.
Dame Angela, one of the party's most respected figures, surprised MPs by
standing down from Decision Makers, a prominent lobbying group.
The Tory MP gave no reason for her decision to resign, and no specific
allegations of impropriety have been raised against her by Labour MPs.
But earlier this week a newspaper drew attention to a successful campaign by
the lobbying company to put the Channel tunnel rail link station at
Ebbsfleet in Kent rather than Stratford in east London. The article in the
Evening Standard claimed that cement company Blue Circle, which owns the
land chosen for the site of the station, employed Decision Makers to press
its case with the govern-ment.
According to the Standard members of the lobbying company met government
ministers, including Mr John MacGregor, the former transport secretary.
Dame Angela, who has regularly declared her position with Decision Makers in
the Commons register of members interests, said yesterday that she had done
nothing wrong, but had decided to step down following the newspaper report.
She told the paper earlier this week: 'I'm very open about it. I've
absolutely nothing to hide at all. Everyone knows perfectly well where I was
coming from. I wasn't going in to meetings as deputy chairman of the party.
I was going in as a representative of Decision Makers.'
Earlier this week Mr Bryan Wilson, Labour industry spokesman, referred the
reports about Ebbsfleet to the Commons committee on members' interests.
However, Labour MPs expressed surprise yesterday that Dame Angela had
decided to step down when no specific allegations had been levelled against
her. Mr Wilson said: 'Coming on the heels of the Ebbsfleet story, Dame
Angela's resignation appears to represent an admission that a conflict of
interest has existed.'
Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, demanded a statement by Dr
Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, over whether he had been
influenced by Dame Angela in the choice of station.
Dame Angela, 61, is a former minister at the Department of Education and
more recently served as minister of state at the Home Office. She first
entered parliament 12 years ago. After the 1992 general election she was
given the deputy chairmanship of the Tory Party and was put in charge of
recruiting new parliamentary candidates.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Hamilton successor seems safe choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major yesterday chose a 44-year-old Welsh MP to replace Mr Neil
Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, who resigned earlier this week.
The prime minister appointed Mr Jonathan Evans, the MP for Brecon and
Radnor, to the post after deliberating for two days over how to fill the
vacancy at the Department of Trade and Industry.
Backbench Tory MPs believe that, amid continuing allegations of sleaze
against ministers, Mr Major would have been keen to ensure that the new
minister enjoyed a spotless record as an MP.
Against this background Mr Evans appears a particularly safe choice. He
entered parliament at the last election and, apart from his legal practice,
did no remunerated work outside the House of Commons last year.
The Commons' Register of Members Interests for the last parliamentary
session shows that his only consultancy was as an unpaid adviser to the
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
Mr Evans was at the centre of a minor political storm earlier this year,
however, when he resigned from the government over the proposed reform of
Welsh local authorities.
He quit his unpaid post as a parliamentary private secretary to Sir John
Wheeler, the Northern Ireland minister, and led a backbench revolt resulting
in a government defeat in a Commons committee.
He and another MP complained that the government had broken a promise made
in the approach to the 1992 general election to replace the existing
two-tier system of county and district authorities with a single tier of
councils.
DTI officials would not confirm yesterday that Mr Evans would definitely
take over Mr Hamilton's responsibilities for corporate affairs and
deregulation. The government may take the opportunity to divide the
responsibilities of junior ministers.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Government ready to name Nolan's nine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government last night invited leading figures from the worlds of
politics, academia and business to join the Nolan committee investigating
standards of conduct in public life.
Amid continuing allegations of sleaze against ministers, the leaders of the
three main political parties yesterday held negotiations over the membership
of the committee to be headed by Lord Nolan, a leading Law lord. Each party
leader has nominated a parliamentarian from within its own ranks to sit on
the committee, which will produce its first report within six months.
It is understood that the government had asked Mr Tom King, the former
Northern Ireland Secretary, to be the Conservative party's nominee. Mr Peter
Shore, the former cabinet minister, has been nominated by Labour and Lord
Thomson of Monifieth, the former chairman of the Independent Broadcasting
Authority, was nominated by the Liberal Democrats.
The committee will also include six figures from outside parliament to
examine whether the rules relating to the conduct of MPs, ministers and
civil servants need to be tightened up.
Downing Street was still finalising the committee membership last night.
However, the prime minister, who drew up the list with Lord Nolan at a
meeting on Wednesday, is understood to have invited the following leading
figures to join the committee:
Sir Martin Jacomb, the 64-year old chairman of the British Council and
former chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd; Sir William Utting, former chief
inspector at the Department of Health; Ms Diana Warwick, the chief executive
of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and former general secretary of
the Association of University Teachers; Mr Anthony King, professor of
government at Essex University; and Sir Clifford Boulton, the retiring Clerk
of the House of Commons. A tenth member of the committee is also due to be
appointed, and is likely to be a leading figure from the civil service.
Negotiations over the membership of the committee coincided with signs that
the government and the Labour party were trying to strike a deal over the
conduct of the Commons privileges committee, which is examining the
cash-for-questions affair.
Both sides were yesterday continuing talks to arrive at a compromise over
how the committee should conduct its hearings into whether Tory MPs were
paid cash to ask the questions. Last week, all seven Labour MPs on the
committee withdrew after Tory members secured a vote to hold the sessions in
private.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Major and Blair clash on Aitken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major and Mr Tony Blair clashed yesterday over allegations of
impropriety against Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary.
Amid rowdy Commons exchanges, Mr Major accused Mr Blair of 'descending into
the gutter of public life', as the Labour leader demanded a public hearing
of allegations against Mr Aitken and other ministers.
In the first serious Commons row since Mr Blair succeeded John Smith as
Labour leader, Mr Major bluntly refused to discuss the allegations and
accused opposition MPs of political grandstanding and peddling gossip.
The row blew up after Mr Aitken refused to duck questions about newspaper
allegations that he had lied to the cabinet secretary about reports that he
had paid only half his bill at the Paris Ritz, owned by Mr Mohamad Fayed,
the owner of Harrods.
Ignoring advice from Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, that he need not
respond, Mr Aitken told Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, that he
completely denied the 'scurrilous accusations', printed in The Guardian.
'I hope this house, which is a very fair-minded place, will accept both my
assurance and the cabinet secretary's assurance, and put an end to the
hysterical atmosphere of sleaze journalism by The Guardian,' he said.
The claims of impropriety dominated prime minister's question time. Mr
Major, giving unequivocal support to Mr Aitken, refused to identify an
unnamed informant alleged to have made allegations on behalf of Mr Fayed.
As Tory MPs jeered, Mr Blair claimed Mr Neil Hamilton, the former corporate
affairs minister, had been sacked following 'unfounded' allegations but Mr
Aitken had been retained in spite of 'unsubstantiated' allegations. 'What is
the basis on which you decide to retain or dismiss your government ministers
 -the truth of the allegations or merely the number of them?' he demanded.
Mr Major said: 'I understood that when you became leader of the Labour party
we were going to see a new style in politics. I had not expected to see you
step down into the gutter of public life quite so soon.'
Mr Blair shot back: 'You will only get a grip on this problem when you
understand that there has to be a proper method of investigating the
allegations of Mr Al-Fayed in which the public has confidence, and that
means an open, full investigation in public view.'
Mr Major told Mr Blair: 'We now know where we are with you. We know
precisely what way you plan to play politics. You say you don't believe the
allegations are substantiated - yet still you are prepared in here to peddle
them.'
Rising for the third time - the first occasion on which he has done so since
becoming Labour leader - Mr Blair declared: 'It is not me that has dismissed
two of your ministers - it is you.'
He added: 'Nobody on this side is saying whether these allegations are true
or false, merely that they should be investigated. Why won't you allow that
to happen in public?'
Mr Major told him: 'You say the matters may not be true. They may be
unsubstantiated gossip and yet you want them peddled in public so that
people's reputations may be harmed.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / Labour waves on peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Northern Ireland peace process must be kept moving forward, Ms Marjorie
Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said last night, warning that any
slackening of the pace would be 'counter-productive for everyone involved.'
Ms Mowlam used her first Commons appearance in her new role to advise others
involved in attempts to forge a durable settlement in the province not to
dig in their heels in the hope that a Labour government would soon be
elected.
She said: 'No one will have anything to gain by prevarication and
procrastination in the hope of a change of government. 'We have got to keep
on trucking.'
In a wide-ranging speech summarising Labour's position on recent
developments, Ms Mowlam highlighted the party's support for the Downing
Street declaration and the principle that there could be no change in
Ulster's constitutional status without the consent of a majority of its
people.
But she also reaffirmed Labour's commitment to the unification of Ireland by
consent.
Promising that Labour would 'facilitate and encourage' a balanced
constitutional settlement, she set out five required features for such a
package. These were:
Provisions ensuring that constitutional legislation in Britain and Ireland
was 'mutually consistent' and consistent with the principle of majority
consent.
Strong devolved government in Northern Ireland elected by proportional
representation.
Parity of esteem and equity of treatment for both communities, reflected in
fair employment, policing and the administration of justice.
Deepening cross-border co-operation.
Secure guarantees from both governments for any new constitutional
arrangements.
She called for assurance that the Treasury would 'keep its hands off' public
spending in the province.
In the first Commons debate on the province since the IRA and loyalist
ceasefires, Mr Nicholas Scott, a former Tory Northern Ireland minister,
called for long jail sentences of terrorist prisoners in the province to be
reviewed.
His contribution sparked an angry response from Mr David Wilshire,
Conservative MP for Spelthorne, who said some Tories 'would find it
absolutely impossible to go down the track you are suggesting'.
Earlier Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, announced a Pounds
1m fund to help those disabled by violence in the province.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Historic echoes for Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small piece of history will be made in Dublin today when Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing, meets the republic's mainstream political parties for
the first time as the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation gets under way.
The 35-member forum, which will sit once a week, will include Northern
Ireland's moderate nationalist Social Democratic Labour party and the
province's small, non-sectarian Alliance party. But with no formal
representation from Ulster's majority unionists, the forum has already been
dismissed as a pan-nationalist front.
Certainly, if there is to be a reconciliation it will be between the
fractured parties of Irish republicanism, rather than Ireland's two
religious traditions.
For the return of Sinn Fein to the political fold is itself a momentous
event. All Ireland's constitutional parties apart from Labour trace their
origins to Sinn Fein, which led the war of independence against British
colonial rule.
Officials are quick to point out the parallels with the 1983-84 New Ireland
Forum, where the task had less to do with reassuring unionists than
bolstering the constitutional nationalists of Mr John Hume's SDLP which, in
the wake of the hunger strikes, was losing electoral ground to Sinn Fein.
Today Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, is the central mover
behind the project. He sees a real urgency to rehabilitate the hardliners of
Sinn Fein and a danger that the peace process could unravel if this is not
achieved.
The forum is seen as a period of political quarantine for Sinn Fein in the
countdown to full political talks with London and the all-party discussions
on the future of the province.
The going will not be easy. Sinn Fein will no doubt try to take the high
ground as the only all-Ireland political party, contesting elections north
and south of the border - a border which it does not recognise. Its language
of liberation may encourage the armed volunteers in the field, but is not
likely to go down well in the more cynical confines of Leinster House, the
Irish parliament.
In one important respect Sinn Fein is on its own. It is the only party
represented not to have endorsed the Downing Street declaration, or what the
Irish prefer to call the Joint Declaration, the 12-point accord which set
the peace process in train last December.
Pointedly, the forum's terms of reference spell out that it is set up in
accordance with the joint declaration.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Boredom test sorts out the Freds from the Wilmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Royal Navy deck officer has devised a way to identify those who can
cope with long spells of boredom at work while staying alert for the
unexpected, and weed out those who tend to nod off.
The test is being marketed for use in recruitment for jobs such as airline
pilots, train drivers and security personnel.
Mr Martin Dyer-Smith, a researcher at the University of Northumbria, said
the test was capable of sorting people into two categories that he had named
'Freds' and 'Wilmas', after the Flintstones cartoon characters.
ASE, the firm of occupational psychologists, is marketing the test which
involves computer screen tasks that look for vigilance and certain thinking
abilities.
Mr Dyer-Smith said Fred was a butterfly character not well suited to long
periods of vigilance, whereas Wilma - his cartoon wife - had the
concentration and attention to detail necessary for the job.
He stressed that there was no gender issue, however, and that there was no
shame in being a Fred. 'You may well be an absent-minded and dithering
genius given to flashes of brilliance one minute and periods of complete
inactivity the next,' he said.
Mr Dyer-Smith, who worked out the test with a colleague, Mr Dave Wesson,
told delegates at the Harrogate conference that he had developed his
theories while serving in the Navy.
Disasters at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, he said, could have been
prevented had there not been a series of human errors in environments where
the belief was that 'nothing could go wrong'.
Mr Dyer-Smith said that in circumstances of low stimulation the natural
human response was to slow down. The extension of this was to fall asleep.
He asked: 'Who hasn't nodded off in a boring lecture?'

FT  28 OCT 94 / Age discrimination unfair
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Age discrimination by employers and recruiters should be against the law, a
pressure group said yesterday.
Mr Richard Worsley, director of the Carnegie Third Age Programme, which
deals with issues concerning older people, said there was a need for one law
to tackle discrimination in employment.
Mr Worsley told the Harrogate conference that unjustified age discrimination
was preventing the 14m people in Britain aged between 50 and 74 from making
an important contribution to the economy.
Government consultation on proposals for legislation to end discrimination
against disabled people, he said, held out the possibility that age
discrimination would be neglected and unregulated, outside the equal
opportunities agenda.

FT  28 OCT 94 / SIB review holds mixed bag for life insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stark differences in how far individual life insurance companies will have
to go in re-examining their personal pension cases are set to emerge when
City regulators review progress on compensating the victims of pension
mis-selling.
The Securities and Investments Board, the chief financial watchdog, is to
look again in a year's time at the plans it set out this week for providing
redress to people harmed by poor advice in buying a personal pension.
A study by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow suggested that 850,000 people were
advised to take a personal pension and to opt out of, or not to join, an
occupational scheme.
Its publication sparked renewed concern about standards of selling in the
life insurance industry.
SIB's review will assess whether cases of investors less likely to be at
risk than the 350,000 cases in high priority categories also need to be
examined, or whether work can be scaled back because the extent of
mis-selling is less than feared.
Companies which could show that they had few or no victims in the categories
of investors most at risk could find their workload reduced, or the
timescale for achieving it relaxed.
But insurers with a high rate of poor advice or large numbers of doubtful
cases are likely to be told to re-examine additional categories of pensions
sold.
SIB has set a deadline which should mean that most priority cases are
reviewed by the end of 1996. But starting the process of identifying people
who were badly advised to opt out of, or not to join, an occupational
pension scheme may not start until early next year.
The regulator is designing the questionnaire which must be sent to all
employed personal pension customers as a first step, and the market research
it has commissioned on this may not be complete until mid-December.
TSB, the banking and insurance group, yesterday joined other insurers in
playing down the extent of possible further provisions against potential
pension claims.
Mr John Elbourne, TSB's head of retail banking, said fewer than 9,000 of the
55,000 cases where the group had sold personal pensions to people
transferring lump sums out of employers' schemes were in the SIB's highest
priority category.
He added that more than half the 80,000 personal pensions sold to employed
people had been taken out since 1990, when the group banned sales to people
opting out of occupational schemes.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Probe on bus operator urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour yesterday wrote to the Department of Trade and Industry to demand an
inquiry into Stagecoach Holdings, the bus operator.
It said several Office of Fair Trading inquiries had found evidence of
anti-competitive practices.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's industry spokesman, said that when Stagecoach
moved into an area, it flooded it with buses 'to undercut existing operators
and to create a bus war which they are guaranteed to win because they
invariably have the deeper pockets'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Judges awarded extra pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Judges are to receive a fixed percentage increase in their salaries on top
of any annual rise recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body, the
government announced yesterday, Robert Rice writes.
The additional rise will run for five years from April and is designed to
bring judicial salaries up to the levels recommended in the body's 1992
report.
The biggest additional increase of 2.48 per cent will go to the Lord Chief
Justice, Lord Taylor, taking his salary to at least Pounds 130,000 by 1999.
The second highest increase of 2.41 per cent will be paid to law lords and
the Master of the Rolls, taking their salaries to a minimum of Pounds
120,000 by 1999.
High Court judges will receive a 1.57 per cent extra rise eventually taking
their earnings to Pounds 100,000. They receive Pounds 95,051 at the moment.
Senior Circuit judges, who already receive close to the 1992 recommended
figure of Pounds 83,000, will nevertheless get an extra 0.63 per cent,
taking them past Pounds 83,000 by 1999. At the moment they receive Pounds
82,641.
The additional percentage was agreed by the government last November but it
has taken until now to sort out the correct percentage increase for each
judicial grade.

FT  28 OCT 94 / No relish for cheese and pickle sandwich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a rare display of corporate humility yesterday one of the world's
best-known companies admitted to making a big mistake when it unveiled a
secret weapon to take on the UK's supermarket chains.
McDonald's, the hamburger chain that brought the world the Big Mac, thought
it had another winner when it announced the new product to its expectant
staff.
Enter the McPloughman's, a cheese, pickle and salad sandwich. Mr Paul
Preston, president of McDonald's in the UK, told the conference that the
McPloughman's was devised to compete with supermarkets in the cold sandwich
market.
Instead of applauding this marketing innovation, however, staff were
unimpressed. Mr Preston admitted: 'If we had done our homework we would have
found that our customers didn't want the product and our staff were
embarrassed even to have to say McPloughman's, let alone to have to sell it
to our customers.'
In a masterly piece of understatement, he added that if the company had
carried out market research 'we would have found that this was not a highly
desirable product'.
When it did survey customer attitudes it found even more shocks were in
store. Customers, he said, told McDonald's they were 'loud, brash, American,
successful, complacent, uncaring, insensitive, disciplinarian, insincere,
suspicious and arrogant'. He said: 'We thought we knew about service. Get
the order into the customer's hands in 60 seconds - that was service. Not
according to our customers. They wanted warmth, helpfulness, time to think,
friendliness and advice. What they told us we were giving was horrifying.
'What we had failed to see was that our customers were now veterans in the
quick-service market and their expectations had gone through the roof.'
The McPloughman's market test was restricted to central London and
shortlived. Only now, more than three years after the sandwich debacle and
the first customer survey, has the company felt confident enough to reveal
the episode.
Mr Preston said the research, first carried out late in 1991, had been a
turning point for McDonald's in the UK which had led to a radical change in
its business approach.
Rather than relying on gut feeling that it knew what customers wanted, the
company had developed a fact-based approach to planning.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Lloyds chief warns of large industry upheaval - Personnel
conference told of tough financial environment / Call to employ older people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's financial services industry is facing an upheaval on the scale
that has been experienced by manufacturing industry, according to Sir Brian
Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank.
Sir Brian said that although about 160,000 jobs had already been lost in
financial services in the past five years the competitive environment was
going to get tougher still.
If banks were to survive in the increasingly competitive market, he said,
they would no longer be able to give automatic pay rises.
He told the Institute of Personnel and Development annual conference in
Harrogate that further bank branch rationalisation that was likely to cause
unrest among bank employees. 'We have to be prepared in top management for
massive resistance in this change,' he said.
Sir Brian added: 'It is vital that top management is completely honest with
employees. You have to dampen down their expectations.'
He had told Lloyds Bank employees that a 1 per cent increase in their pay
was equivalent to 650 jobs.
Sir Brian said that the changes were being forced by Britain's low inflation
strategy leading to low demands for loans. Inflation would no longer bail
out poor advances on property, he said, meaning that banks would need to
manage their business more rigorously. Lloyds itself has closed 450 branches
in the past five years.
In a candid outline of the financial realities facing the banking sector he
said that banks' annual accounts would no longer be distorted by inflation,
giving them a deceptive gloss of health.
He said: 'Many people have grown fond of inflation. Annual pay rises and
rising house prices make people feel good, even if they mean little in
reality. In future the only good reason for a pay rise will be an increase
in a firm's productivity or the particular performance of an individual
team.'
Widespread overcapacity at a time of low growth, he said, might produce
unprecedented levels of competition in which only the most productive
companies were going to win. For bank employees it meant facing enormous
change.
'Having joined banking in the expectation of job security and steady career
progression, many are now faced with branch network rationalisation, job
losses and general uncertainty,' he added.
Sir Brian was criticised afterwards by the banking union Bifu.
Mr Ed Sweeny, deputy general secretary, said: 'He should stop, look and
listen to what his staff and customers are saying. The opprobrium heaped on
the banks during the last few years shows they are out of step with the
public.'

FT  28 OCT 94 / Union concern over BT disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Telecommunications is next week expected to announce the sale of its
off-shore cable laying division - BT Marine - to Cable &amp; Wireless, one of
its main international competitors.
The deal is likely to have implications for C&amp;W's industrial relations
policies.
BT Marine - which employs about 450 people, owns six ships, and has a record
for technical innovation in the field of cable laying - is fully unionised
and covered by collective bargaining. But in many of its worldwide
operations C&amp;W does not recognise unions.
The main union in BT, the NCU communications union, opposes BT's policy of
selling off peripheral businesses and is not likely to be happy about a sale
to C&amp;W.
However, C&amp;W is currently seeking to improve its image with unions as it
attempts to establish more joint ventures with many of Europe's national
telecommunications groups.
All of those groups are strongly unionised and in many countries the unions
have considerable influence over corporate decision making. Last year the
Communication Workers Union in Ireland lobbied hard to stop Telecom Eireann
signing a joint venture with C&amp;W.
Mr David Begg, CWU general secretary, said yesterday that the decision to
oppose C&amp;W was taken partly on strategic grounds and partly because of the
company's world-wide record on union recognition.
A spokesman for C&amp;W rejected the allegation that C&amp;W was anti-union. 'In 50
per cent of our 60 companies around the world we recognise a trade union or
staff association. We tend to adopt the local custom and practice,' he said.
Union officials claim that C&amp;W prefers not to recognise unions, but will do
so where it has to. It recognises the ships officers union, Numast, for
example.
C&amp;W is unlikely to de-recognise the NCU within BT Marine in view of the
sensitivity of the union issue. Although it is possible that the union might
be de-recognised for collective bargaining but allowed representation
rights.
Mercury, the BT rival which is owned by C&amp;W, does not recognise the NCU but
recently had talks with the union about the possibility of establishing some
formal relationship.
Final details of the BT Marine deal have yet to be negotiated, but C&amp;W is
expected to pay about Pounds 10m for the Pounds 60m turnover division.
Neither company would comment yesterday on the deal.
The NCU, which has several hundred members in Mercury, has not yet had an
official reply to its request for recognition, but is expecting one soon.
Mercury seems highly unlikely to offer full scale recognition for collective
bargaining, but it might offer a lower level right of representation which
would allow unions to represent members in disciplinary matters.

the preferential trading arrangements of the Lome Convention, intended to
aid 46 developing countries, were compatible with Gatt.
He said the waiver request was a precaution in view of criticism of Lome by
a Gatt panel which attacked the EU's banana import regime as contrary to
world trade rules. The Gatt Council is due to consider the waiver request on
November 10.

<TEXT>
A patent infringement suit filed by US biotechnology company Genentech
against Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a unit of Sumitomo Chemical, has been
rejected by a court in Osaka, according to Sumitomo. Genentech filed the
suit in 1989 alleging Sumitomo copied the same genetic engineering
techniques used to develop a tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) used to
treat heart attack patients.
The court said techniques used by the two companies were not identical and
it did not constitute a patent infringement. Sumitomo said it was unable to
provide details of the ruling. The court and Genentech in Japan declined
comment.
The controversy concerns amino acid sequences used to produce TPA by
Genentech and Sumitomo. Sumitomo said its TPA was developed by Sumitomo
itself before Genentech's genetic engineering techniques were made public.
In 1992, Genentech won a similar suit against the Japanese company Toyobo
over the same product. The court ordered Toyobo to stop producing its TPA.

FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Textile exporters hit at pace of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
First steps in a 10-year programme to liberalise world textile and clothing
markets agreed in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks will do little to
open rich-country markets, Third World textiles exporters said yesterday,
writes Frances Williams.
The International Textiles and Clothing Bureau, which groups 21 developing
country exporters, noted 'with dismay' that the three biggest textile and
clothing importers - the US, European Union and Canada - had decided to
start with products not currently subject to import restraints.
They 'have hardly liberalised any significant MFA restriction on any
developing country,' the bureau said, referring to the Multi-Fibre
Arrangement that now allows quotas on most Third World textiles and clothing
exports to the industrialised nations.
Under the Uruguay Round accord, MFA importers must bring 16 per cent of
textiles and clothing trade under normal world trade rules next January and
another 17 per cent in January 1998.
The bureau calculates that, with more than a third of US and EU textile and
clothing imports now unrestricted, they would be able to delay real
liberalisation until the third stage of the MFA phase-out in seven years'
time.

FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: HK tycoon plugs in to subcontinent - Wu
mothballs China plans and signs Dollars 19.5bn power deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The man who has taken up the World Bank's invitation to switch the lights on
in India and Pakistan has been forced west by the prospect of diminishing
returns in east Asia.
In a matter of weeks, Mr Gordon Wu, one of Hong Kong's more flamboyant
tycoons, mothballed his plans to build and manage power stations across
China and signed agreements for power projects in India and Pakistan worth
about Dollars 19.5bn over ten years. He is already scouting the Indian
subcontinent for more.
The Harvard-educated businessman had China firmly in his sights last year
when he raised HKDollars 5.94bn (Dollars 769m) with the flotation of the
Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA). This company, which was hived off
from Mr Wu's flagship company, Hopewell Holdings, was sold to investors as a
play on China's massive power requirements - a need on which China will
spend some Dollars 120bn over the next decade to satisfy.
At the time of its December listing, CEPA boasted two China power plants,
Shajiao B and Shajiao C, the latter of which is still under construction,
and letters of intent for another 14. Of more importance to the investors
who swooped on the new scrip, CEPA had the visionary Mr Wu and his 'cookie
cutter' approach to power plants - building a string of generators with the
same design, thus bringing economies of scale, across China.
Mr Wu favours the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model whereby CEPA builds the
plants, operates them for a specified period, and then transfers ownership
back to the government. The anxieties of government (especially communist
governments) are allayed by the fact that ownership ultimately returns to
the state, while the company benefits from playing a raft of money-making
roles: civil engineering, project development and project management.
However, these plans were scuppered earlier this year when it became clear
China's reform-minded officials were starting to baulk at foreigners
extracting robust profits from strategic industries and that a cap was to be
placed on returns which could be netted on power projects.
In the absence of clear guidelines from Beijing, bankers and other industry
players (not least those at CEPA) are still unclear as to the nature of this
cap, which initially stood at 12 per cent but is now believed to have been
lifted to 15 per cent. For example, it is not clear whether the rate of
return referred to is on equity or capital employed.
CEPA promptly switched tack, and this year prefaced the deals in the Indian
subcontinent with two in the Philippines and Indonesia. It is still pursuing
a project in China, in the southern coastal city of Shenzhen, for four units
of 660 MW. Mr Wu hopes to have a power purchase agreement from the Shenzhen
authorities by early next year.
But the China experience has induced a wariness among the company's
management. Although the India and Pakistan projects announced earlier in
the month triggered a share price rally, directors are taking an untypically
low-key stance.
For all the potential of the latest projects, they remain at the memorandum
of understanding (MoU) stage. As one CEPA executive says: 'An MoU could stay
an MoU forever. This is what we have in China. We have lots of letters of
intent, which are similar to MoUs elsewhere, and they are just paralysed and
have been for almost a year.'
The India connection was brought about through the World Bank, and followed
a visit in which Mr Wu put forward an initial proposal to build power
stations. The World Bank had been urging CEPA to assess power station
projects for some time, according to the company, but it postponed action
because of the anticipated workload in China. Last month the invitation was
taken up in style: an entire team of technical and commercial chiefs met Mr
PV Narasimha Rao, prime minister, as well as representatives from the
ministries of finance and power, and an MoU was issued.
However, CEPA is upbeat about opportunities for the power industry in the
Indian subcontinent. On a per capita basis, India has a still bigger
requirement than China.
In India, where there are as yet no stated guidelines, CEPA reckons it can
squeeze an internal rate of return of close to 20 per cent, while in
Pakistan the limit has been set at 18 per cent. The projects in Shenzhen,
Indonesia and the Philippines are also expected to give returns over 18 per
cent.
Assuming the proposed 16 units of 660 MWs in India go ahead, funding will
come from a variety of sources, including the International Finance
Corporation, which is affiliated to the World Bank, commercial bank loans
and global equity markets - ultimately, each of the company's power projects
is likely to be spun off as a separate listing, creating a string of CEPA
subsidiaries and raising additional funds from shareholders.
At this stage, funding is a long way from being one of CEPA's most pressing
concerns. The nature of power plants means spending will be spread over 10
or 12 years. Meanwhile, there is the HKDollars 5.94bn raised from the CEPA
flotation - much of which was earmarked for the China projects.
That listing was itself controversial, as it in effect stripped the China
and Philippines power station projects out of Hopewell Holdings, which was
then on a price-earnings ratio of around 16 times (slightly higher than the
Hong Kong market as a whole) and sold them back to investors packaged as
CEPA, on a p/e ratio of around 39 times (in part a measure of the time lag
before the power plants could start to produce big earnings).
However, the Hong Kong market at that time was awash with both liquidity and
bullish sentiment, especially for anything with the word 'China' prominent
in the prospectus, and the HKDollars 1.17bn public element of the combined
offering was 45 times oversubscribed.
CEPA blames itself for failing to communicate better with these shareholders
now that they complain they bought into a China stock that failed to
materialise. Mr Ricky Lau, assistant to director Lawrence Miao, says the
reasons for CEPA's recast focus were not well communicated to investors, but
he believes this has now been rectified.
Moreover, he says, the Shenzhen project is still very much on the cards, a
testimony to the growing autonomy of provincial governments in the southern
coastal provinces.

FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: 'Bio-piracy' costs Third World Dollars
5.4bn a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
'Bio-piracy' is cheating developing countries and their indigenous peoples
of Dollars 5.4bn a year, a UN-commissioned report*, published yesterday,
claimed. This is the amount they would be entitled to in royalty payments if
multinational food and drug companies paid for their plant varieties and
local knowledge.
The report puts the value of Third World plant species to the pharmaceutical
industry alone at more than Dollars 30bn a year It says that while more than
90 per cent of the earth's remaining biological diversity is located in
Africa, Asia and South America, indigenous communities receive no reward for
the material and local knowledge taken from them.
This inequity is exacerbated by growing use of patents granting exclusive
protection to companies and researchers in industrialised countries for
material and knowledge coming from the developing world. Citing the example
of patented seed varieties derived from varieties bred by farmers, the
report says 'indigenous farmers are finding themselves paying for the end
product of their own genius'.
The report, by Ottawa-based Rural Advancement Foundation International
(Rafi) for the UN Development Programme, urges changes to rules governing
ownership of biological materials and knowledge about them.
Ms Sarah Timpson of UNDP says the UN body has begun consulting indigenous
peoples' organisations on strategies to preserve traditional knowledge and
prevent exploitation.
The report cites more than 100 examples of developing country contributions
to agriculture, food processing and pharmaceutical development in the rich
nations.
They include Bayer's synthetic aspirin, the most widely used drug in the
world, which is derived from a traditional Arab medicinal plant, Spiraea;
steroid hormones made by Syntex derived from barbasco roots from Mexico; and
a streptomycin-based antibiotic isolated from Argentinian soil which
Mitsubishi has patented as an additive for animal feeds.
Admitting that piracy by developing countries of chemical and pharmaceutical
patents may cost the industrialised world as much as Dollars 2.7bn a year,
Rafi says this is far outweighed by the amount the Third World would be owed
if it received just 2 per cent in royalties for global seed industry sales
of Dollars 15bn, and 20 per cent for pharmaceutical products derived from
indigenous plants.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Army may be sent after Rio drug barons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil is considering sending its armed forces into Rio de Janeiro's shanty
towns to combat the city's drug traffickers amid widespread concern that the
police have lost control and are heavily involved in corruption.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, due to take over as president on January 1,
yesterday added to calls for the outgoing administration to act.
He said he favoured military intervention in Rio, which he described as
being in a state of 'undeclared civil war'.
Calls for troop deployments have been welcomed by Rio residents who are
tired of the city's spiral of violence and corruption. However, previous
proposals have been blocked by Rio politicians, who fear losing power to the
federal government.
Outgoing President Itamar Franco now appears ready to act, but may not have
enough political backing. Putting troops on the streets would be
controversial given Brazil's unpleasant memories of 21 years of military
rule which ended in 1985.
The latest proposal follows a shoot-out 10 days ago in a Rio shanty town in
which police killed 13 people, including a two-year-old boy. Police said
they were hunting drug traffickers who had attacked a police station a few
days earlier. However, fights between police and drugs gangs are more often
caused by competition for control over drug networks.
Following the incident, the justice ministry and armed forces sent Mr Franco
a confidential report thought to have raised the possibility of military
intervention.
A spokesman said the president was still 'analysing' the report and no
action would be taken ahead of a scheduled meeting on Monday between the
president and Mr Nilo Batista, Rio's governor.
If Mr Batista requests intervention the federal government is thought ready
to deploy troops quickly. If he opposes the plan, the government could take
control of Rio state through a variety of constitutional mechanisms, which
would allow it to strip him of his power.
However, the outgoing government is thought reluctant to take such a measure
because it would involve the temporary suspension of some constitutional
rights and require congressional approval. This might not be forthcoming so
close to the government's departure from office. Military leaders are
believed to favour intervention, although they admit it could be risky. Most
of Rio's drug traffickers live in the centre of the shanty towns. These are
often perched on the top of hills and innocent bystanders would probably be
caught in the crossfire if troops intervened.
The military is also worried that a prolonged period of patrolling the
shanty towns could lead to poorly paid troops being co-opted by drug
traffickers, which is how corruption of the police force started.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Clinton poll rating cheers Democrats
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Democrats yesterday had some good news in their struggle to retain
control of the US Senate and House in hotly contested mid-term races across
the country.
A new Gallup poll showed President Bill Clinton's approval rating rebounding
by 8 points to 48 per cent. However, it is unclear whether this will
translate into support for Democrats on November 8. Many have been trying to
avoid the president during their campaigning.
In New York state, support is slipping for Mr George Pataki, running to
unseat Governor Mario Cuomo. Before leaving for the Middle East Mr Clinton
campaigned hard for the governor, who got another boost from the endorsement
earlier this week of New York City's Republican mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
is unhappy with his own party's candidate.
In Massachusetts, Senator Ted Kennedy, in the tightest race of his 32-year
Senate career, surged ahead of his rival Mr Mitt Romney after a television
debate on Tuesday.
Meanwhile in California, support has been ebbing for a controversial
anti-immigration initiative, strongly supported by Republican Governor Pete
Wilson and Congressman Michael Huffington. Both are in tight contests, Mr
Wilson to keep his post and Mr Huffington to move to the Senate.
Proposition 187, the so-called 'Save Our State' provision, will be on the
California ballot. According to an independent poll by the San Francisco
Field Institute, support for the measure has dropped from 64 per cent in
July to 53 per cent.
Immigration has become a 'hot button' political issue in California and
Florida. But many voters appear to believe Proposition 187 goes too far. It
would deny non-emergency healthcare and social services to illegal
immigrants and prohibit their children from going to California schools.
Mr Clinton has spoken out against the law, as has Mr Jack Kemp, a popular
Republican conservative. Miss Janet Reno, attorney general, said yesterday
it was probably unconstitutional. 'It doesn't make sense to turn school
teachers and nurses into border patrol agents,' she said. 'It doesn't make
sense to kick kids out of school or not give them immunisation.'
Mr Huffington yesterday confirmed a published report that he had employed an
illegal immigrant as a nanny for five years, even after he was sworn in as a
congressman in 1993. Two appointees for attorney general in the early days
of the Clinton administration were forced to withdraw because of similar
accusations.
This was good news for Senator Dianne Feinstein, Mr Huffington's opponent,
who has been moving up on him in the polls. Yesterday a spokesman for the
Republicans accused Mrs Feinstein of the same violation. It was denounced as
'an outright lie' by Mrs Feinstein's campaign manager.

The US House Banking Committee and its subcommittee on international
institutions said yesterday they would host a meeting of foreign
parliamentarians on reform of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund. The parliamentarians invited on November 21 will be those who oversee
the international institutions in their own legislatures. Acceptances have
been received so far from Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, Argentina,
Costa Rica, Venezuela, Canada and Australia.
Mr Michael Bruno, World Bank chief economist, and Mr Jeffrey Sachs, Harvard
economics professor, will be on an expert panel discussing efforts to open
the IMF and World Bank to public scrutiny. The meeting will also consider
their effectiveness, particularly in alleviating poverty, and the
relationship between development aid and international labour and
environmental standards. The reform effort has been led in the US by
Congressman Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, who has pushed through
legislation requiring US executive directors to make a country's observation
of international labour standards a lending condition.

The anti-trust division of the US Justice Department has announced an
agreement which would end a threat by travel agents to boycott airlines, car
rental agencies and other service providers which do not agree to pay
specific minimum commission levels. The Association of Retail Travel Agents,
a group representing 2,000 travel agents, had adopted a set of 'objectives'
which included minimum commission levels and other demands, according to the
Justice Department. The association said it would cease doing business with
travel providers who did not agree to the 'objectives.'
The Justice Department, which took legal action against the proposals, filed
a proposed settlement in Virginia this week which would force ARTA to drop
the threats and require it to conduct periodic reviews of anti-trust
requirements with its officers and directors.

<TEXT>
Prudential Securities yesterday concluded an agreement with US government
prosecutors to settle charges that it defrauded hundreds of thousands of
investors in the 1980s who bought high-risk limited partnerships from the
Wall Street firm. The investors claimed Prudential Securities brokers did
not inform them fully of the risky nature of the investments, many of which
lost them billions of dollars. Prudential Securities has already agreed to
pay compensation. Yesterday, it agreed to deposit another Dollars 330m in
the settlement fund, and the overall cost to the firm of the scandal,
including legal fees, is believed to have topped Dollars 1bn.
Under yesterday's deal, Prudential will continue to co-operate with the
government over settling claims and has admitted wrongdoing. In return,
federal prosecutors will dismiss criminal charges if the firm refrains from
similar violations for the next three years. Prudential Securities also
agreed to take steps to improve its internal supervisory procedures,
including appointing a new outside director to the board who will act as an
ombudsman and provide quarterly compliance reports to the board's audit
committee and the US government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development are considering a compromise in their long disagreement over a
new secretary-general.
Under the 'two-plus-five' deal, Mr Jean-Claude Paye of France who presently
holds the post would be reinstated for another two years. He would then be
succeeded by Canada's Mr Donald Johnston, a former cabinet minister, for a
full five-year term.
The Canadian foreign affairs department said yesterday that 'we don't have a
consensus yet. No deal has been done.' The appointment requires consensus
among all 25 members.
While it is clear that Paris and Ottawa favour the deal, the US has
indicated it is likely to oppose it. Washington is expected to hold firm to
its contention that new blood is needed in the OECD and that jobs in the
increasingly global trading system should no longer be based on regional
origin.
US officials believe the jobs call for 'higher profile people' who have easy
access to leaders and ministers.
The OECD job has become caught up in horse-trading over other top
international posts, notably head of the new World Trade Organisation,
successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
The three contenders for that post are South Korea's trade minister Mr Kim
Chul-su, Italy's former trade minister Mr Renato Ruggiero and Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
France and Canada have been discussing ways to break the deadlock over the
OECD post since Mr Andre Ouellet, Canada's foreign minister, visited Paris
earlier this month.
Mr Johnston, who works for a Montreal law firm, has been strongly backed by
the US and several other non-European members. They insist it is time for a
non-European to fill the post. But France, supported by most European
members, has until now refused to withdraw Mr Paye's candidacy for a third
five-year term.

FT  28 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Tax vote turns off
Philadelphia suburbs - An account which Montgomery County's wealthy aim to
settle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even before Congresswoman Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky cast the 218th and
deciding vote for President Bill Clinton's budget in 1993, she was the
Republican party's top target for the November 8 congressional elections.
Two years ago, she became the first Democrat since 1916 to represent her
generally conservative district in Montgomery county, west of Philadelphia,
winning by just 1,373 votes.
But 'the 218th vote' for a budget that raised taxes on high incomes seemed
sure to doom her in these wealthy Philadelphia suburbs, where registered
Republicans outnumber registered Democrats two to one.
Sure enough, Ms Margolies-Mezvinsky is trailing in her battle for
re-election. But she is ecstatic about a local opinion poll that shows her
winning 32 per cent of the vote against 39 per cent for Mr Jon Fox, the
Republican county commissioner whom she defeated in 1992 and who is her
opponent again this year.
'I should be 40 points down,' she said after a raucous public debate with Mr
Fox and two independent candidates near the county seat of Norristown this
week.
The results show that even in the most hopeless of districts a good
Democratic candidate with a strong campaign can stay within reach. They also
show that, despite the Republicans' confident predictions that they are on
the verge of taking over both the Senate and the House of Representatives,
the Democrats' weakness is not the Republicans' strength.
'I voted for Marjorie last election and she was a total letdown. She didn't
represent me on any of the issues I was concerned about,' complains Mr Chris
Zabala, who was particularly outraged by her vote to ban assault guns.
But Mr Zabala plans to vote for the Libertarian candidate, Mr Lee Hustead,
who wants to abolish most of the US government, starting with the Federal
Reserve, the Department of Health and Social Security and the Department of
Education.
'Republicans and Democrats - I've had it with them,' he scoffed.
Mr Bob Sambrick of Norristown also plans to vote Libertarian. 'I'm looking
for a candidate that's going to be for the people, and I haven't found one
yet. I'm going Libertarian - any other vote except Republican or Democrat,'
he said.
Yet the howls of anger against the political status quo seem unlikely to
translate into solid political results.
There are surprising numbers of self-proclaimed Libertarians on the streets
of Norristown or Conshohocken, old industrial towns along the Schuylkill
river with many of the problems of urban decay faced on a larger scale by
nearby Philadelphia, but more scientific polling shows Mr Hustead winning
just 4 per cent of the vote.
Nevertheless, 22 per cent of those questioned in this week's poll for the
KYW radio and television stations said they were still undecided, and 40 per
cent of those who expected to vote for Mr Fox were still not certain they
would do so.
In a surprisingly large number of districts across the country, Republicans
have chosen candidates who are poorly positioned to exploit the Democrats'
weakness.
Some, like Mr Fox, are professional politicians ill-equipped to capitalise
on voters' general frustration with politics as usual. Ms
Margolies-Mezvinsky's television advertisements hit hard at the fact that Mr
Fox has run for office 10 times in the past 15 years, and has run for four
offices in the past four years.
Others, like Mr Rick Santorum, the Republican congressman who is trying to
unseat Mr Harris Wofford, Pennsylvania's Democratic senator, are
sufficiently extreme in their views to alienate a good number of voters in
the middle. While Mr Santorum's opposition to even the most minimal controls
on assault guns may play well in parts of the state, he stands well to the
right of Republicans who have in the past won statewide elections in
Pennsylvania, such as Senator Arlen Specter.
In Montgomery county, too, the two candidates are divided by gun control. Ms
Margolies-Mezvinsky's support for a ban on assault guns wins her votes in
wealthy suburbs like Narberth and Bryn Mawr, clustered along the Main Line
railway into Philadelphia, and among Republican women who were crucial to
her victory in 1992.
The National Rifle Association's endorsement of Mr Fox carries more weight
further out in semi-rural areas like Skippack and Whitpain, where walled
condominium housing developments with guards at their gates are sprouting
among the horse paddocks and pumpkin fields.
But Ms Margolies-Mezvinsky still faces an uphill struggle if she is to
confound the Republican congressmen who chanted 'Goodbye Marjorie' as she
cast the '218th vote' for Mr Clinton's budget last year.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Back on its feet, Argentina casts aside its financial props:
Menem's administration has certainly transformed the economy but the
emergence of a budget deficit is causing some concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
In seeking to explain why Argentina had recently turned down International
Monetary Fund loans worth Dollars 400m, President Carlos Menem chose the
image of a baby finding its feet. 'You've seen how a child is given a walker
to help him learn to walk. Well Argentina is already up and walking,' he
said. 'We simply did not need these credits.'
Other commentators, however, have speculated that Argentina chose to cut off
IMF assistance in order to avoid too close scrutiny of its public accounts,
particularly in relation to the recent emergence of a budget deficit.
'The withdrawal from the extended facility agreement, due to the
impossibility of meeting the goals for the public sector fiscal surplus,
revealed (brusquely for some) that, in the economic arena, a new era has
begun,' says a recent report from economic consultant Mr Rodriguez Giavarini
y Asociados.
After more than two years of being in the black and a 1994 first-half
primary surplus, excluding privatisations, of Dollars 2.4bn, Argentina's
fiscal position has begun to deteriorate. Earlier this week, Mr Domingo
Cavallo, the economy minister, announced that the third-quarter primary
surplus had shrunk to just Dollars 9.7m, representing a deficit of Dollars
665m after interest payments.
The announcement contributed to a one-day fall of 3.15 per cent on the
Merval selected share index. 'There are clouds on the horizon. What was a
surplus of nearly Dollars 500m a month is probably going to be a deficit
throughout the whole second half,' says Mr Javier Fraga, managing director
of the Argentine Institute of Capital Markets.
Much, though not all, of that weakening is related to social security
spending. But Mr Cavallo denies that monthly revenue shortfalls of about
Dollars 180m a month - provoked by the recent shift of 2m workers from a
pay-as-you-go system to a private capitalisation scheme - are to blame.
This funding gap was budgeted for, he says. What has come as a surprise has
been a series of court rulings in favour of retired people demanding higher
pensions. The court decisions, which Mr Cavallo believes may open the
floodgates for thousands of other claims, could add hundreds of millions of
dollars to government expenditure. They have also undermined the governing
Peronists' attempts to limit the pensions bill, which accounts for nearly
half the federal budget.
'If this spending continues we will have problems,' says Mr Cavallo, who has
sought to curb judges' generosity by raising the spectre of renewed
inflation should expenditure get out of hand. 'We have been using the
surplus of the first half to finance the Dollars 600m deficit of the third
quarter,' he says.
Mr Cavallo may find his efforts to put a lid on spending particularly
difficult given that general elections are only seven months away.
Provincial governors are not likely to curb their demands for extensive,
voter-friendly, public works programmes.
Difficulties have been compounded by a drop in the collection of value added
tax and customs revenue, partly as a result of tax rebate measures intended
to help exporters. In September, total tax collection fell by 3.4 per cent
against the same month in 1993.
Mr Cavallo is again unrepentant, saying that lowering payroll taxes is
essential to boost competitiveness. 'Of course it may look a bit risky
because, just on a purely fiscal evaluation, it could be safer not to reduce
tax rates and collect more revenue. . . . But we are convinced that every
time we create a surplus there will be more pressure to spend it.'
Nevertheless, the combination of falling income and higher expenditure has
forced Mr Cavallo to ast Congress to amend the 1994 budget, authorising
extra spending of Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn. He will also push for measures
aimed at limiting future pensions payouts, forcing 'an interpretation of the
law that is in line with what is feasible from a financial point of view'.
Says Mr Daniel Artana, economic consultant at the Foundation for Latin
American Economic Investigation: 'It is the first time that Cavallo has
retroactively changed the budget. This is a bad sign, but he has little
alternative.'
Mr Artana believes, however, that the government's difficulties are
temporary and not structural. 'We are in a more fragile situation than we
used to be, especially on the fiscal side. But everyone tends to exaggerate,
including Cavallo.'
Mr Miguel Angel Broda, head of the Broda economic consultancy, agrees that
it is important to keep things in perspective. Argentina is moving from one
of the strongest fiscal positions in the world to a slightly weaker one, he
says. The break with the IMF was almost inevitable, given that 'everybody
looking at the fiscal goals for 1994 (a total primary surplus of Dollars
3.9bn) knew that it was going to be difficult to meet the second-half
targets.'
Mr Fraga goes one further: 'I congratulate the government for seeking a
reasonable fiscal position and not the exaggerated one asked for by the
IMF.'
Mr Cavallo is not overly worried by the emergence of a deficit. 'We had
planned a half per cent surplus in 1994, but now we think that we will have
a balanced budget for the year.'
Mr Menem, too, displays confidence. 'We have only received congratulations
from the IMF,' he says. 'We are now a country that is growing, producing and
progressing.'
Certainly, few would dispute that Mr Menem's administration has successfully
hauled the country out of the economic ditch of instability and
hyperinflation. But now that Argentina is on its feet - and walking on its
own - all eyes will be watching to make sure that it does not stumble.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Zimbabwe may tell Oxfam to leave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oxfam, the UK charity, faces possible expulsion from Zimbabwe after an angry
government response to its criticisms of the country's health policy. In a
report* out this month, Oxfam accused the government of being partly to
blame for a reversal of post-independence improvements in health, by cutting
spending and imposing user fees.
In parliament, Mr John Nkomo, social welfare minister, condemned the study
as 'misleading, unscientific, and deliberately mischievous'. Its
'insinuations, distortions and deliberate falsification of figures are not
acceptable.'
Oxfam officials said last night they will be meeting the government in
Harare next week, but declined to comment on Mr Nkomo's apparent expulsion
threat. The report queries government claims that the country's structural
adjustment programme makes adequate provision for protecting the health of
the poor.
'Despite the mounting body of evidence showing a clear correlation between
user fees and worsening health indicators, the government of Zimbabwe
increased these fees and imposed more stringent conditions for their
collection in January 1994,' the study says.
Spending on health as a percentage of GDP has fallen to 2.7 per cent,
according to Oxfam, the lowest since independence in 1980. 'Under pressure
from the World Bank, the Zimbabwe government has increased expenditure since
1992,' says the report, noting 'a nominal increase in the 1992-93 budget
amounted to a decline in real terms of around 20 per cent.'
Government officials said Oxfam's local representatives had earlier been
summoned by Dr Timothy Stamps, health minister; he is understood to have
called for an apology and retraction.
There is an overwhelming case for withdrawing user fees, says Oxfam:
'Unfortunately, the Zimbabwe government's policy is pulling in precisely the
opposite direction, as witnessed by the sharp increase in user fees in
January 1994.'
Oxfam last night said it stood by the report. 'Our primary concern is relief
from poverty; we cannot be expected to turn a blind eye to policies which
result in the poor carrying the cost of macro-economic adjustments, however
necessary they may be,' Mr Stewart Wallis, overseas director, said.
Ironically, many of the findings are borne out by the government's own
research. *Paying for health: Poverty and Structural Adjustment in Zimbabwe,

A Cambodian who had spent two months translating for three Westerners held
hostage by the Khmer Rouge said yesterday they were killed last month by a
mortar round while on their way to be ransomed. Earlier, in Sydney,
Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said he had credible but
unconfirmed reports that the Australian, Frenchman and Briton had been
killed by a commander of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group.
Australian David Wilson, 29, Briton Mark Slater, 26, and Frenchman Jean
Michel Braquet, 27 were seized on July 26 in an attack on a train in
southern Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge had demanded Dollars 150,000 (Pounds
93,700) for their release. The translator, Mr Hem Nen, said that a week
after the transfer was to have taken place, guerrillas coming back from the
front lines told him the hostages had been killed. 'I investigated and the
exact information is that the three hostages died,' Hem Nen said. 'But I
don't know where they put the bodies. I didn't dare to ask them.' In London,
a British Foreign Office spokesman said there was no proof of the hostages'
deaths; the UK government was doing its utmost to establish the facts.

Bangladesh's parliament was summoned to meet on November 12 as the
Commonwealth-brokered talks between the government of Prime Minister Khaleda
Zia and opposition leaders resumed yesterday. Sir Ninian Stephen, a
Commonwealth emissary, joined the talks aimed at ending the impasse created
by opposition demands for fresh elections under a non-partisan caretaker
government. All 154 opposition MPs have boycotted parliament and staged
rallies and general strikes since March to press for Mrs Zia's resignation
and fresh elections. Mrs Zia, who came to power in 1991 after a decade of
military rule, was elected in polls which observers judged mostly free and
fair. But the opposition parties, led by Mrs Sheikh Hasina's Awami League,
claim they were rigged and say the government has interfered in subsequent
local and by-elections. Sir Ninian, who arrived in Bangladesh a fortnight
ago, has held a series of meetings with government and opposition leaders to
aimed at narrowing their differences and ending the crisis. On Wednesday, he
averted a breakdown of talks between government and opposition leaders.

An international consortium will have to spend Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 2.8bn)
to dismantle North Korea's nuclear programme and replace it with new energy
supplies and safer light-water reactors, South Korean officials said
yesterday. Seoul is expected to support 55 per cent of the cost, with the
rest split among the five UN Security Council members, and Japan, Canada,
Australia and Germany.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said the project will
include Dollars 3.5bn for light-water reactors, Dollars 500m for dismantling
North Korea's nuclear reactors, Dollars 300m for interim heavy fuel oil
supplies and Dollars 100m to run the consortium, the Korea Development
Energy Organisation, in the next decade. South Korea is expected to finance
its share from the national budget, with funds raised through sale of
government stakes in listed companies or privatisation of state-owned
companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A bill to reform Japan's pensions system, to cope with the fast growing
number of elderly, was yesterday passed by the Diet's lower house. The
scheme will raise pension premiums and gradually increase eligible pension
age from 60 now to 65 in 2013. By then, one in four of the population will
be over 65, up from 12 per cent in 1990. Trade unions and pensioners'
lobbies had objected to the increase in pension premiums included in the
bill, but the government agreed to increase the pension premiums it
contributes from the national budget.
To ease the transition, pensioners beneath the new starting age will get a
partial hand-out, equal to roughly half a full pension. The basic monthly
pension will rise, from Y206,300 (Pounds 1,305) to Y214,300 next year, to be
funded by a rise in pension premiums from the present 14.5 per cent of
salary to 17.35 per cent. The bill gives the government a mandate to raise
premiums to a 29.6 per cent limit.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Clinton supports Mideast bank
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton has committed the US to support the creation of a
Middle East development bank and announced fresh US aid, as part of an
increasing programme of financial support intended to underwrite
Arab-Israeli peace.
The US president yesterday also pledged to maintain the level of US economic
and military aid to Israel at Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) a year, and
continue helping the Jewish state keep a strategic military edge over its
neighbours to 'build a peace that will bring with it the safety and security
Israel deserves'.
In a speech to the Jordanian parliament, Mr Clinton gave his
administration's first public backing to the creation of a regional
development bank to channel new investment to projects.
Mr Clinton pledged his government would take the lead in consultations with
regional and other governments to ensure that the development bank, which
will probably start with a capital base of Dollars 10bn, was properly
structured.
Israeli officials promoting the idea of a regional bank said yesterday Mr
Clinton's remarks would guarantee its creation and, in effect, over-ruled
objections raised by the US Treasury which had put forward an alternative
proposal for creation of a special 'window' in the World Bank for Middle
East regional projects.
Israel wants the US, Europe and Japan to provide 60 per cent of the capital
base of the regional development bank with proportional representation on
the board of directors and expects a US citizen to be the bank's first
president.
Mr Clinton also announced that his government's Overseas Private Investment
Corporation is establishing a Dollars 75m regional fund to encourage US
private-sector investment in joint projects between Israel and Jordan.
The US was committed to help Middle East peace makers 'write a real
practical future of hope', and ensure that peace delivered real economic
benefits to the citizens of the region, he added. 'If people do not feel
these benefits, if poverty persists, breeding despair and killing hope, then
the purveyors of fear will find fertile ground.'
An Israeli official said Mr Clinton's economic announcements showed the US
President understood the political rather than purely economic imperative
behind creating regional financial institutions.
Mr Clinton has underlined during his Middle East tour the vital economic
role the US is playing in the peace process. The US, Jordan and Israel have
set up an economic commission which has produced a plan to develop the
Israel-Jordan rift valley into a 'Valley of Peace' with projects in energy,
desalination, tourism, transport, environment and industry.
In Jordan, Mr Clinton promised 'actively to pursue practical means of
expanding trade and investment'. His administration would develop a
bilateral investment treaty, he declared.
Washington has already begun writing off Dollars 700m of debt owed by Jordan
to the US. Mr Clinton said in Amman he had pledged to forgive all Jordan's
US debts. He had called on Jordan's other creditors to follow his lead.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Dependence on US leaves Kuwait few choices: Little remains
of the Gulf state's policies from before the war against Saddam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's arrival in Kuwait today is designed to demonstrate
the depth of US commitment to the Gulf state in the wake of the renewed
military threats from President Saddam Hussein. But it also underlines the
extent to which the latest crisis with Iraq has deprived Kuwait of what
little freedom of choice it had left in international affairs.
In four years, Kuwait has passed from being a self-consciously assertive
leader of all that was considered progressive in the Arab world, to a state
whose survival depends on continuing US support.
The result has been a paralysis in policymaking on virtually all Middle East
issues. Officials appear to have no more original thoughts than would be
expected were Kuwait's foreign ministry the Gulf branch office of the US
State Department.
Far from regarding these developments as negative, Kuwaitis are basking in a
new-found sense of security that officials are convinced is set to grow. The
danger is that Kuwait's back-seat diplomacy will turn out to be as illusory
as the image that it used to promote on the world stage.
Before August 1990, Kuwait was foremost in championing political and human
rights for Palestinians; it was a leader of the non-aligned movement,
spending generous foreign aid to win friends; it was a decade ahead of its
partners in the Gulf Co-operation Council in opening diplomatic relations
with the Soviet Union.
Today, little of these policies remain. The non-aligned movement is extinct,
as is the Soviet Union. Foreign aid money that might have bought goodwill
has left Kuwait with billions of dollars of non-performing loan assets,
still listed in the State General Reserve Fund 'for book-keeping purposes
only,' one government financial adviser says. As for the Palestinians,
feelings against them run deep for what is still regarded as their
'betrayal' in 1990 for supporting President Saddam.
Jordan's King Hussein is close behind. 'If Saddam Hussein rates a five out
of five on the barometer of mistrust, King Hussein gets a four,' a senior
foreign ministry official said. Others close to Kuwait's Emir, say this
antagonism could change quickly under US pressure following Jordan's peace
treaty with Israel.
In mock seriousness, senior officials suggest Kuwait still has five levels
of foreign policy options. It can call on:
Its own resources.
Security arrangements with its five GCC partners (Saudi Arabia, Oman,
Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Qatar).
The wider partnership of the GCC, plus Egypt and Syria, through the
so-called Damascus Declaration.
The United Nations and the coalition of countries that came to its aid after
the Iraqi invasion of August 1990.
Bilateral defence agreements with the US and three other permanent members
of the UN Security Council: Britain, France and Russia.
In practice, only the last two count for anything, and these are wholly
contingent on a sustained US response to crises such as the one Kuwait has
just faced.
'The deepest feeling among all Kuwaitis is their concern for survival,' says
Mr Abdalla Al-Nibari, a National Assembly member. 'For this, we look to the
US. It is unfortunate, but it is a fact.' A European diplomat describes the
way Kuwait has come to depend on the US as 'first by necessity, now by
conviction'.
But there is a price to pay. 'Kuwait better come up with more dollars and
more soldiers,' US Senator John Warner shouted into the microphone at the
end of a recent press conference in Kuwait, a reminder of US congressional
priorities and an outburst which embarrassed foreigners and left many
Kuwaitis humiliated.
European diplomats argue that Kuwait has become dangerously sucked into the
US's 'personalisation' of policy, which implicitly rules out having to deal
with an Iraq controlled by Mr Saddam.
'We are small and cannot even protect ourselves against Iraq's power, so we
cannot have any views about the internal structure of Iraq,' said Mr
Sulaiman Majed al-Shaheen, foreign ministry under-secretary.
Periodic talks with Iraqi opposition groups such as the London-based Iraq
National Council (INC) and the Washington-based Free Iraqi Council (FIC)
have got nowhere. A senior official conceded that some members of the INC
are 'articulating a policy based on a constitutional monarchy in Iraq'.
But Kuwait, he said, 'doesn't care if Iraq's constitutional monarch is an
Indian guru or a Hashemite, so long as their intentions towards Kuwait are
peaceful'.
Under US protection, Kuwait can afford the same detachment concerning Iran.
'Iran does not have any claim on Kuwaiti territory. Iran only wants to be
number one among equals. Kuwait says we are all equal regardless of size,'
one official said. 'We want the Gulf to be what it is: number one in the
strategy of the big powers.'
So Kuwait is content to leave its future in US hands. This back-seat policy
is based on the assumption that the US is able and willing to provide
open-ended guarantees for the security of Kuwait and the other members of
the GCC. But in politics, as Senator Warner made clear, nothing is certain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In an attempt to ensure its national programme to build 1m houses over the
next five years will be financially viable, South Africa's government has
warned that people who boycott rent or mortgage payments will be evicted
from their homes.
Addressing a national forum on housing in Botshabelo, near Bloemfontein,
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Mr Joe Slovo, housing minister, said
housing targets would not be met unless rent and service boycotts, which
started as a way of opposing apartheid in the 1980s, were ended.
'Those of you who continue to think positively of the boycotts are stabbing
in the back, not what you can call the enemy, but your brothers and
sisters,' Mr Slovo said.
The decision is politically controversial as it may require the African
National Congress-led government to act against many of its political
supporters.
But it is regarded as essential if the government is to have any hope of
meeting the huge backlog in formal housing, estimated at 1.5m houses. At
present, only about 30 per cent of township residents meet their bond or
rent payments.
Mr Slovo used the summit to launch a national housing accord calling for a
partnership between the private and public sector to help increase capacity
in the construction industry and recommending that the government increase
the Housing Ministry's share of the national budget from its present level
of 1 per cent to 5 per cent.
The accord was endorsed by a broad range of township civic associations,
trade unions, big banks and construction companies, as well as
representatives from local, regional and national government.
The declarations follow the announcement last week that the government had
struck a R2bn (Pounds 350m) deal with the private sector that will open up
mortgage loans to the lower end of the housing market and appears to signal
the government is at last ready to release its final blueprints for the
housing programme, expected to be submitted as a White Paper to parliament
shortly.
Several regional ministries have vigorously promoted a policy of building
four-room houses for the country's homeless. Given its tight budgetary
constraints, the government is expected to endorse a more limited
'incremental approach' to the problem.
The government will focus on building fully-serviced, single-room houses
that people can then expand by taking advantage of private-sector
initiatives.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Problems left after HK airport deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The imminent agreement between China and Hong Kong on the territory's new
airport will be an important symbolic breakthrough, but leaves a number of
questions unanswered, according to officials who have followed the talks
closely.
The outspoken optimism of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong governor, in London on
Wednesday night means there is little likelihood of a last minute snag, but
signature of the framework agreement must be followed by specific subsidiary
arrangements allowing the project sponsors to raise much-needed debt
finance.
Mr Patten argued that these subsidiary agreements, which cover the
relationship between the Hong Kong government, the Mass Transit Railway and
the provisional airport authority would follow automatically. Some officials
privately fear, however, that China could turn them into a new set of
bargaining chips in discussions over Britain's handover of Hong Kong in
1997.
Nor would an airport deal necessarily imply a sudden and significant shift
in China's underlying approach to Hong Kong. Mr Patten's offer earlier this
month for Hong Kong officials to collaborate with the preliminary working
committee, which China has set up to prepare for the handover of power, has
met a stony silence from Beijing.
It would only become clear in the follow-up to a framework agreement on the
airport how far the underlying climate has changed.
One view in Hong Kong is that the uncertainties generated by the ill-health
of Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader, make it difficult for Beijing
to undertake any serious policy initiatives. If so, the timing of the
airport agreement would mostly reflect the need for China to distance the
move from the passage of Mr Patten's democracy legislation through the
Legislative Council earlier this year.
It has been clear for some time that obstruction of the airport agreement
would not lead to additional concessions from the UK. Beijing is also
thought to have come under pressure from the business community to settle a
dispute which has cast a shadow over the territory's credit rating.
Without the delay, debt finance for the project could have been raised when
interest rates were lower, Hong Kong officials say. Instead the government
has continued to fund construction of the project so that only about
HKDollars 23bn (Pounds 1.8bn) of debt finance will now be required.
The final ratio of debt to equity will now be about a quarter compared to
around half when the project started. But to raise this finance, the project
sponsors need the subsidiary agreements which demonstrate to lending banks
that they will be repaid out of project revenues after 1997.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Renamo withdrawal confuses voters: UN in frantic effort to
save elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mozambicans went to the polls yesterday in the country's first multi-party
elections in a state of confusion after the former rebel Renamo movement
withdrew only hours before ballot stations opened.
A grim-faced Mr Afonso Dhlakama, Renamo leader, flew into the capital Maputo
from the central port of Beira last night and announced that 'the elections
are false'.
The elections had been intended as the culmination of a two-year peace
process following the 1992 Rome Accord between Renamo and the Frelimo
government which ended Mozambique's 16-year civil war. Just two days ago
United Nations officials, who are supervising the exercise, expressed
confidence that the Mozambican peace process was on the verge of producing
an African success story.
Renamo's withdrawal did not prevent hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans
from queueing up in order to cast their votes. In Maputo many voters
expressed dismay at Renamo's actions, and feared the boycott could lead to
violence.
Renamo has been alleging for weeks that the Frelimo government was planning
to rig the vote, but few expected such drastic action the night before
polling stations opened. Renamo officials said Mr Dhlakama had 'come to the
conclusion that free and fair elections are not possible until certain
technical difficulties are addressed'.
In the frantic hours which followed, Mr Aldo Ajello, the head of the
6,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping mission in Mozambique, as well as
the Mr Brazao Mazula, president of the National Election Commission, pleaded
with Renamo officials not to withdraw. They failed, and when the polls
opened at 7am national radio was announcing Renamo's withdrawal.
In Maputo, thousands of people waited to vote in a subdued but calm
atmosphere. Mr Mario Machungo, prime minister, described Renamo's actions as
'undemocratic and regrettable'. Voting is due to end today.
Reuter adds from Cape Town: South Africa was in touch with all political
parties in neighbouring Mozambique to ensure elections there stay on track,
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said yesterday. 'What we are trying to do is to
ensure that everybody stays in the process and everybody recognises the
outcome of the election,' Mr Mbeki told the senate.
'We are hoping that we will succeed in that because clearly as a country, we
cannot afford to have another Angola on our doorstep.'
In Angola, Unita rebels resumed their civil war two years ago when they lost
elections to the government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Renamo's
Mr Dhlakama maintained, however, that the last-minute boycott by his party
did not mean a return to guerrilla war.

Price Waterhouse, the international accountancy firm, yesterday settled out
of court a HKDollars 2bn (Pounds 158m) civil negligence case brought against
it by the liquidators of Carrian Investments (CIL), the Hong Kong shipping
and property group that collapsed in 1983 with debts estimated at HKDollars
10bn. Details are being kept confidential. A statement issued on behalf of
both parties by the accountancy firm said: 'In agreeing the settlement,
Price Waterhouse deny any liability. But in cases of this complexity, it is
often in both parties' interest to avoid protracted litigation costs'.
The agreement, reached within four weeks of the opening of the Hong Kong
High Court hearing, abruptly ends a case it was thought would run six
months. The CIL company was once Hong Kong's seventh biggest. Opening the
case, Mr Christopher Carr, QC, representing the liquidators, alleged the
auditors had failed in their duty to act as independent watchdog. At the end
of 1981, he claimed, Price Waterhouse passed accounts stating pre-tax
profits surpassed HKDollars 700m, when, the court heard, the reality was a
loss of more than HKDollars 270m.

the European Parliament said yesterday. The parliament proposed the draft EU
budget for 1995 be increased by Ecu800m (Pounds 629m) to reflect the
imminent enlargment of the bloc. Austria and Finland are due to join the EU
on January 1 following successful referendums. Sweden and Norway will vote
on membership on November 13 and 28 respectively. The figure was included in
the parliament's first reading of the draft budget for 1995, in which it
proposed an overall budget of Ecu80.9bn.

The Estonian parliament yesterday backed environment minister Mr Andres
Tarand as prime minister, averting the prospect of early elections in the
Baltic republic. Deputies voted by 63 in favour, with 15 abstentions and one
against, in support of Mr Tarand, who had been nominated for the post by
President Lennart Meri. Mr Tarand, a leading light in Estonia's Green
movement, will take over from Mr Mart Laar, who lost a confidence vote last
month because of what his critics saw as a high-handed, secretive style of
leadership. The appointment of Mr Tarand, a compromise candidate who does
not belong to any party, reflected a lack of enthusiasm among deputies for
early elections. Earlier this month, parliament rejected the president's
first choice, central bank governor Mr Siim Kallas. Mr Tarand said given
that elections were scheduled for next March he did not intend to initiate
any major changes to government policy.

The defence lawyers of fugitive German property tycoon Jurgen Schneider have
said they will no longer represent him, the Frankfurt public prosecutors'
office said yesterday. 'The lawyers informed us that they were resigning
their mandate,' the prosecutors' office said. Media reports said the lawyers
quit because all attempts to contact Schneider personally had failed.
Schneider is wanted by police for alleged fraud. He and his wife disappeared
in April leaving his property group to go bankrupt with more than DM5bn
(Dollars 3.3bn) of debt to banks and trade creditors. His Geneva-based
intermediary, described as an Arab with links to intelligence services and
arms dealers, had consistently blocked attempts to make contact with him,
prompting speculation he may be dead, the media reports said. The lawyers
doubted whether Schneider's signatures on documents giving them power of
attorney were real. But police have verified the signatures and said there
were no indications that Schneider was dead.

<TEXT>
The Bosnian Moslem army has pushed back Bosnian Serb forces in a major
offensive in north-west Bosnia, forcing retreating Serb soldiers to abandon
tanks and mortars. The UN said Bosnian army had attacked out of the Bihac
pocket, capturing between 100 and 150 square kilometres. 'They have caught
the BSA (Bosnian Serb army) unawares and . . . (the Serbs') normally
effective command and control structure collapsed and they withdrew in
considerable disarray, abandoning equipment such as tanks and mortars,' said
military spokesman Colonel Tim Spicer.
Bosnian army fifth corps soldiers were celebrating in the streets of Bihac
town while aid agencies reported several thousand refugees, apparently
Serbs, fleeing the fighting. However, UN military officers in Sarajevo said
the Moslem offensive had slowed and they believed they had paused to
consolidate their gains. The Bihac pocket has been surrounded by Serb forces
for much of Bosnia's 30 months of war. But since it suppressed a revolt by
breakaway Moslems in the summer, the Moslem Fifth Corps has turned its
attention to the Serbs. 'Our assessment is that the BSA is somewhat
stretched at the moment,' Col Spicer said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAT European Airlines, an affiliate of British Airways, announced yesterday
that it would start services between Orly airport in Paris and Toulouse and
between Orly and Marseilles before the end of December. The French
government, which was ordered on Wednesday to open the lucrative routes has
said that services could not start before January 1995. The routes are
currently operated by Air Inter, the state-owned airline, which has a
monopoly on many French domestic routes.
The European Commission said the two routes must be opened immediately
following Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice to reject an
appeal by the French government which was seeking to delay liberalisation of
the routes. The Commission said that the French government could have begun
the procedure of selecting carriers six months ago when it was originally
ordered to open the routes to competition.
TAT, which is 49.5 per cent owned by British Airways and which filed the
original suit demanding access to the routes described the selection process
sought by the transport ministry as a 'another stalling tactic' and
threatened legal action against the French government unless its bid to
operate the routes was not approved within 24 hours. The latest clash
follows the so-called 'battle of Orly' earlier this year in which TAT,
British Airways and other UK carriers threatened to fly to Orly from London
despite the refusal of the French government to grant landing permission.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Cross-border shoppers discover cross-border fraud: The
single market is held back by lack of proper consumer protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why does cross-border shopping amount to only 3 per cent of all transactions
in the famous European single market? Mr and Mrs Roger Degraeve of Ypres can
supply part of the answer.
The Flemish couple were initially delighted with their recent trip to
Kortrijk, still in Belgium, where they made the equivalent of a cross border
purchase after coming across a smooth-talking French salesman who had
organised a competition for a Limoges dinner service. The latter had set
himself up in a temporary stall in a local mall. The Degraeves won, only to
be told their 'prize' could not be delivered unless and until they agreed to
pay BFr64,000 (Pounds 1,269) for the privilege of having their initials
carved in gold on each and every plate.
Grudgingly, the Degraeves agreed to a BFr24,000 downpayment, but then
decided not to pay for their 'prize' and contacted the European Consumer
Information Agency (ECIA) office in Kortrijk which told then that under
Belgian legislation they had a seven-day reflection period in which they
could change their mind and revoke their payment. The Kortrijk office
contacted its French counterpart in Lille and the French fraud office in
Paris who eventually got the Degraeves back their money from the
Limoges-based china company, 'La Table des Cesars', which from subsequent
complaints lodged with Kortrijk and Lille still appears to be carrying out
its marauding raids on Belgian consumers.
Traditionally, these consumer bodies are dispensers of data such as the vast
array of comparative beer prices in northern France, Belgium and Kent open
to anyone dialling into the ECIA computer in Lille. Increasingly, however,
they are also having to double up as trouble-shooters. The five 'jurists' in
the ECIA office in Lille have, for instance, dealt with some 300 complaints
in the first seven months of this year.
Figuring high among the purchases which trigger French complaints about the
Belgians are furniture, ready-made verandahs, and second hand cars. Mrs
Mireille Leroy, the ECIA's Lille director, says French furniture hunters
tend to flock into Belgium 'where the salesmen are good, warehouses are open
on a Sunday, coffee and creches are provided and people are sometimes ready
to sign any old piece of paper'. The upshot is that the Lille centre gets
regular complaints about goods that are misdescribed or delivered late or
not at all; one French buyer of a Flemish wardrobe found it was heavy in
weight as well as style, being partly made of concealed concrete.
What makes these cases harder to resolve than the standard consumer disputes
or frauds occurring inside EU member states is precisely the difficulties
inherent in trying to pursue a foreign company in a foreign language through
a foreign legal system. Sometimes the stake for individuals can be quite
high. Mrs Leroy points to the case of some French in Alsace who, she says,
'have landed themselves deeply in debt by taking life insurance mortgages
from Commerzbank which carry a tax advantage in Germany, but not in France'.
Generally, however, the sums of money involved rarely justify an aggrieved
consumer calling in a lawyer in one country, let alone in two countries.
The Brussels Commission is contemplating two measures to improve consumers'
access to justice and to regularise guarantees. One is a plan for a
standardised complaint form which, when duly translated, judges and consumer
agencies around the EU will readily recognise and act on. The other is
harmonisation of the different legal guarantees offered by EU members. This
basic right of redress, distinct from additional commercial guarantees
offered by specific manufacturers for specific products, only lasts for six
months in Germany, but for six years in Britain and Ireland.
This worry over what-happens-if-it-goes-wrong is, according to consumer
surveys, what most often deters shoppers venturing over borders. Until this
concern is eased, the single market will remain unexploited.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's central bank, the Riksbank, yesterday moved to counter inflationary
pressures by raising its key short-term interest rate, the repurchase rate,
by 20 basis points to 7.40 per cent. It is the second time the bank has
lifted interest rates in the last three months and the first increase since
the Social Democrats won the September general elections. Analysts said the
increase bolstered the Social Democrats' anti-inflation credentials
following the appointment of Mr Kjell-Olof Feldt, a former Social Democrat
finance minister, as chairman of the Riksbank's board of governors. The
Riksbank warned last week that Swedish inflation might exceed the bank's
target of 3.0 per cent next year. Rising producer prices and signs of
bottlenecks in the manufacturing sector have already pushed up inflation to
2.7 per cent. The bank made its move despite the recent strengthening of the
krona and a fall in long-term bond yields.
East German industrial output rose in August by 14.1 per cent year-on-year
after increasing in July by 9.4 per cent. West German engineering orders
rose by 18 per cent in real terms in September from a year ago.
Spanish industrial production rose by 11.6 per cent in August, after rising
4.8 per cent in July
Belgian inflation figures were much better than expected, falling to 2.12
per cent in October from 2.46 per cent in September.

Eurofer, the Brussels-based umbrella body for Europe's big steelmakers, said
yesterday it was 'astonished and disappointed' by the European Commission's
decision on Tuesday to scrap the rescue plan for European Union steelmakers.
The association called on EU industry ministers, who will discuss the
Commission's decision on November 8, to maintain the plan. It said EU
producers had come up with more than 17m tonnes of realised or planned
capacity cuts, close to the Commission's target of 19m tonnes.
'These figures show that the results achieved up to now cannot be considered
a failure,' it said. It also regretted the loss of the Commission's
quarterly guidelines on steel production and deliveries by product line, and
criticised the Commission's decision to propose that curbs on steel from the
Czech Republic and Slovakia end a year early, at the end of 1994.

FT  28 OCT 94 / EU collective investment scheme laws 'a failure'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union legislation aimed at spurring a genuine cross-border market
in collective investment schemes has largely been a failure, according to a
new study.
Lipper Analytical Services, the US-based mutual fund research group, has
concluded that just over a third of so-called Ucits - 'undertakings for
collective investments in transferable securities' such as equities or bonds
 -are genuinely marketed across European borders.
Roughly 38 per cent of the 5,436 Ucits are marketed outside the country of
domicile of their promoters. A significant portion of Ucits are
'round-trippers', Lipper Analytical said. This means they are domiciled in
the low-tax centres of Dublin and Luxembourg but marketed exclusively into
the country in which their promoter is domiciled, making them effectively
low-tax domestic collective investments or 'round trippers'.
Of the 937 Ucits which have been notified for marketing in only one country
outside their country of domicile, 608 can be identified as
'round-trippers'. Promoters of Ucits have to notify authorities in the
countries they wish to sell but do not require their permission.
'If the question is 'has the Ucits Directive succeeded in creating a single
market for funds?' then the answer must be 'No', says the report. Despite
the common legal framework, each member state retains control over local
fiscal and marketing policies. 'Tax efficiency and effective distribution
remain the major factors in determining the use made of the directive to
market a fund to the investors resident in another state.'
The report also found a large number of Ucits - 281 with total net assets of
Dollars 13.1bn which are notified for sale in Luxembourg but are not sold in
any other European country. Luxembourg has a population of only 375,000 and
Lipper Analytical is sceptical that these are intended for domestic
consumption. Instead, they are likely sold outside the EU. European Fund

FT  28 OCT 94 / Ukraine close to winning aid from western donors

<TEXT>
Ukraine was last night close to securing financial aid from western donors
and debt relief from its Russian and Turkmen energy suppliers at a Group of
Seven-organised conference in Winnipeg.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, said Russia, which is owed
Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.7bn) for oil and gas exports to Ukraine, was
prepared to join the Paris club of official creditors and reschedule Dollars
625m of payments due in the fourth quarter of this year.
Ukraine is seeking Dollars 900m for the fourth quarter to carry out the
economic stabilisation agreement reached recently with the IMF, according to
Mr Roman Shpek, the Ukrainian economy minister.
In an attempt to ensure such assistance, the Ukrainian national bank passed
a decree on Tuesday to unify the exchange rate, one of the measures urged on
Ukraine by its international creditors.
This will leave the value of the karbovanets, the temporary national
currency, to be determined by the market and not, as hitherto, by the
hard-currency priority committee.
The government this week also announced bold price and export liberalisation
measures which will cut subsidies on food, rents and energy, and remove
bureaucratic limits on a range of export products.
Ukraine's President Leonid Kuchma, heading the Ukrainian delegation, told
western donors the reform programme hinges on immediate western aid and a
successful debt rescheduling agreement to cover its Dollars 600m
fourth-quarter balance-of-payments deficit.
'We badly need help to get through the next two months and restructure our
accounts. We are staking everything on the visit to Canada,' Mr Oleh
Rybachuk, international department head at the National Bank, said before
the conference began.
Ukraine asked Russia and Turkmenistan, who are owed over Dollars 3bn for oil
and gas exports, to conclude a rescheduling agreement. About Dollars 340m of
the Dollars 600m financing gap for the fourth quarter is attributable to
energy imports unmatched by exports.
Russia, which faces its own debt renegotiation problems, was reluctant to
reschedule; Mr Alexander Shohkin, Russian minister for economic affairs,
earlier suggested Russia would prefer to exchange debt for former Soviet
assets, including land, in the Ukraine.
Before the conference, the European Union also dragged its feet, demanding
repayment of past arrears of Dollars 100m and action to close the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant, which EU members still consider a big hazard but which
the Ukrainians need to reduce their dependence on imported energy.
The US committed Dollars 70m which it said it would raise to Dollars 100m if
the EU came up with similarly-sized balance-of-payments aid. Canada pledged
Dollars 25m.
Ukraine, with a population of 53m, has a total foreign debt of around
Dollars 7bn.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Polish minister quits in row over bank job

<TEXT>
Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's foreign minister, resigned yesterday
claiming his honesty had been questioned by publication of a list of
politicians' directorships.
Mr Olechowski, a former finance minister, said that Mr Wlodzimierz
Cimoszewicz, the justice minister who had prepared the list of senior
government officials on the supervisory boards of state owned and private
companies had 'questioned his honesty' by suggesting he had been improperly
paid for a second job. Mr Olechowski had figured correctly on the list as
the head of the supervisory board of the state owned Bank Handlowy, one of
the country's largest banks.
By Polish law government officials are permitted to represent the state on
the boards of nationalised companies but are not allowed to accept pay from
sources other than their post in the administration. The law has however
remained a dead letter and contains no sanctions for transgressors.
The list included 56 officials in such posts of whom a mere handful did the
work for no extra pay. Mr Olechowski was stated to have received pay of
three times the average wage.
Mr Olechowski, who said he would stay in post until December, became foreign
minister a year ago when he joined the government as a nominee of President
Walesa. Under Poland's constitution, the president has special
responsibility for the foreign, internal affairs and defence ministries
which are cabinet posts.
The last year has seen repeated turf wars over these three ministries
between the president and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, head of the
Peasant Party. The search for Mr Olechowski's successor provides the
opportunity for a full scale clash as Mr Walesa recently made clear he wants
to co-ordinate foreign policy.
Mr Olechowski is a non party politician whom opinion polls show as being one
of the country's few potential candidates who stand a chance of winning next
year's presidential election against Mr Pawlak or Mr Alexander Kwasniewski,
head of the post communist Left Democratic Alliance.
President Walesa is trailing in the polls, with 48 per cent saying he is
mistrusted. Mr Olechowski in contrast is mistrusted by a mere 8 per cent.
His confidence rating is 54 per cent, just behind that of Mr Kwasniewski and
Mr Pawlak. President Walesa last night appealed to Poles to support his
efforts to strengthen the powers of the presidency and said he would only
run for re-election if this happened. 'We need order and strong authority',
he said on television. 'Today's Poland is weak and nobody's in charge,' he
added, saying that a strong presidency would enable him to 'rule with a
strong hand'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Yeltsin was real target of no-confidence motion in duma:
John Lloyd explains the political machinations behind yesterday's vote on
the future of the Chernomyrdin government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Technically, yesterday's no-confidence vote in the Russian parliament was
aimed at the government of Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. But it had a
bigger target in its sights as well - President Boris Yeltsin.
The government won the vote, but the relatively high figure of 194 deputies
voting against the government - just 32 short of a majority - shows that
opposition to Mr Yeltsin has grown significantly. The impression is
strengthened by the small number of deputies from normally supportive
liberal parties - 54 - who voted against the no-confidence motion, with
another 55 who cast an abstention (the remainder simply did not vote).
The opposition's hard core is the Communist Party of Russia, led by Mr
Gennady Zyuganov. The party, relatively disciplined and normally able to
count on the support of the Agrarian Party, has rejected any compromise with
Mr Yeltsin, refused to sign his (now somewhat tattered) Pact on Social
Consensus and has said it will refuse to accept seats in the cabinet.
The other large anti-presidential group is the Liberal Democratic Party, led
by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky - who yesterday confirmed his unerring feel for
the quotable remark when he warned ministers to resign when they could - or
face arrest when he came to (presidential) power next year, to institute a
dictatorship.
However, it lacks the discipline of the Communists and its members probably
both abstained and as well as voted against the government.
The same is true of the Agrarians and the communist-leaning Women of Russia
Party - though Mr Yeltsin's naming yesterday of Alexander Nazarchuk, an
Agrarian and chairman of the duma agriculture committee, as agriculture
minister in place of Mr Victor Khlystun, may have swung a few votes the
government's way. Mr Khlystun was no radical - but he had angered the
Agrarians and others on the left by going along with modest reform in the
agricultural sector, and his successor is unlikely quickly to repeat the
mistake.
At the same time, however, the nomination showed on what a fine line Mr
Yeltsin is now treading as he seeks to sway this way and that to retain his
government. On its announcement, Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the main liberal
party, Russia's Choice, commented sourly: 'It now makes it impossible to
speak of any reform in the agricultural sector at all.' He threatened to
change his party's vote and oppose the government.
The Democratic Party, which had tried to keep to the shifting centre, is now
split - with half of its 15 MPs rallying round Mr Sergei Glazyev, the young
former trade minister whose pungent and informed attacks on the budget have
put him at the head of those in the Duma opposing the economic strategy. He
knows from the inside the horse trading, heroic assumptions and guestimates
which make up the Russian budget - and, with a burning conviction that a
monetarist policy is destroying Russian industry, he has positioned himself
to be high in the ranks of any opposition cabinet which might take over.
But that will not be tomorrow. This opposition is composed of men and women
whose inexperience of party politics, desire for individual prominence and
fear that they may have to take responsibility for the economy was always
likely to combine to undermine the no-confidence vote.
Mr Zyuganov's bitter comment last night that 'we did not get rid of the
government because such a vote would require courage' had some truth -
though it is unclear how far those who voted for the no confidence motion
lacked courage, or folly.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Russian officials play down size of Arctic oil spill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEKTYVKAR, THE KOMI REPUBLIC,, MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian officials were yesterday divided on the seriousness of the oil spill
in the Arctic region of Komi - though it now seems likely that first
estimates of the size of the spill were exaggerated.
Mr Alexander Shuval, press director of the Environment Ministry, said that
'This is potentially a very dangerous accident for the environment'. He said
that 14,000 tonnes of oil (130,000 barrels) of oil had leaked from a
ruptured pipeline in an oilfield near Uzinsk, in the north of Komi.
However, in the Komi capital of Sektyvkar, Mr Anatoly Nyukin, head of the
civil defence department - who also quoted the 14,000 tonne figure  - said
he had not seen a single bird or fish affected by the oil spill. The effects
of the oil leak had, he said, been confined to a 9km stretch of the River
Kolva, which flows into the River Usa, which in turn flows into the Pechora
River and thence to the Barents Sea. Mr Vyacheslav Bibikov, the republic's
deputy chairman, said that 'the situation is localised and under control. We
do not need any external help'.
Mr Nyukin said that the very heavy rain which had burst the dam in which the
oil had been held following the rupture of the pipe had spread the oil over
18 hectares of land. However, work on the polluted area had stopped its
further spread, he said.
US experts had estimated the leakage as up to 2m barrels (over 270,000
tonnes), ten times the Russian estimate. They also claim the rupture has not
been properly repaired.
Mr Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister for emergencies, said the leak had
already cost Rbs62.2bn (Dollars 20.3m) to contain.
A team of Russian experts has been prevented from reaching the site of the
spill in the Komi republic, over 1,000 km (700 miles) north-east of Moscow,
by bad weather.
The pipeline, which carries oil from producing areas in the Arctic to
refineries in central Russia, sprang a series of leaks in August.
Western oil experts, charging that 10 per cent of Russian oil leaks away
each year, said it was a disaster waiting to happen.
'Many of the (former Soviet) pipelines suffer considerable corrosion,' said
Mr Egil Bergsager, of Norway's Rogalandsforskning Institute in Stavanger. 'I
would not be surprised if we get more accidents like this.'
The environmental group Greenpeace said Russian companies pumped oil down
the damaged pipeline, although it had 'as many holes as a Swiss cheese'. The
pipeline operator, Transneft denied the charge.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Russia puts radical reform back on agenda: Document reveals
determination to try to create new economic climate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian government is determined to try once again to pursue radical
economic reforms, according to a document on economic strategy obtained by
the FT.
Written by Mr Yakov Urinson, the first deputy economics minister, the
document provided the background against which Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister, gave a largely uncompromising speech to the duma (lower
house) yesterday. It admits that 'at the moment, economic and political
instability, inflation, high-cost credits and mistrust in the authorities
make up a generally inhospitable climate for investment'.
Only by changing that climate can the rouble be stabilised. And to change
the climate, the report confirms the government's commitment to a monthly
inflation target of 2 per cent over next year, the eschewing of credits from
the central bank and the funding of the deficit by the issue of treasury
bills and borrowing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy premier for the economy, said last week the
government hoped for as much as Dollars 14bn in IMF and Bank credits next
year - an expectation the Fund has been at pains to play down.
The paper lays out an industrial strategy which gives pride of place to
ending subsidies and credits to 'hopeless' enterprises and concentrating on
existing or newly created businesses which can attract a mixture of state
and private capital. It wants to 'closely co-ordinate' the second phase of
the privatisation programme with measures to stimulate private investment;
and it wants to make investment attractive to individual savers.
As for the long-suffering foreign investors - there is, again, a frank
recognition of the causes for their suffering, and of the urgent need to
convince them that the government is on their side. If it can do so - Mr
Urinson does not spell out how it might be done - then 'we can expect
foreign investment to run at around Dollars 5bn to Dollars 6bn a year from
1995'.
The document is equally frank in recognising that Russian industry, its
output still falling, its technology archaic and its work relations
unreconstructed, is in no condition to stand unprotected before the world
market. The government will thus continue its policy of 'reasonable
protectionism' - using an array of weapons, including tariffs, quotas,
export credits and manipulation of the rate of the rouble.
However upbeat its determination to re-commit itself to a harsh path - not
yet consistently followed by any of the post-1991 Russian governments - its
forecasts sketch an economy still tumbling. GNP is expected to come out at
between 92 per cent and 94 per cent of this year; production is set to
continue falling, by 3 per cent to 5 per cent (compared to 8-10 per cent
this year). Oil output will be 6 per cent down, at 295m tonnes; gas a mere 1
per cent down at 600bn cubic metres; and coal 1 per cent down on this year,
at 270m tonnes.
These are rather better figures, if they come to reflect reality. However
big falls will continue in engineering (expected to be 12-14 per cent down);
timber (13-15 per cent down); light industry products (15 per cent down);
agricultural output (6 per cent down).
The commitment is strong. But the edifice rests on the assumption that the
deficit will be financed by a vast issue of treasury bills and a very large
package of loans. Critics were questioning both last night.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Forstmann acquires Ziff's publishing business for Dollars
1.4bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Most of the assets of Ziff-Davis Publishing, a US leading pub lisher of
computer magazines, trade newspapers and books, are to be acquired by
Forstmann Little, a New York investment firm, for Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds
857m) in cash.
The privately held publishing group is being sold by the Ziff family, which
will retain a small equity interest. The three Ziff brothers, Dirk, Robert
and Daniel, have approximately a 90 per cent interest in the company. They
announced plans to sell the business - built up by their father William - in
June.
The men said their interests were in investing, rather than publishing.
Proceeds of the sale will go to Ziff Investments, an investment firm run by
Dirk Ziff.
The sale has attracted broad interest in the media industry because Ziff is
on the leading edge of multimedia publishing, including computer on-line
publishing and CD-Rom titles and because computer publications are one of
the strongest growth sectors in publishing.
Other companies believed to have shown a serious interest in acquiring parts
of Ziff include Anglo-Dutch publishing company Reed Elsevier, Japanese
software distributor Softbank and German media company Bertelsmann AG. K-III
Communications, McGraw Hill and Time Warner are also said to have considered
bidding.
Mr Dirk Ziff said the family was 'delighted' with the sale agreement. The
Forstmann bid was attractive, among other reasons, because the investment
group was expected to be able to close the transaction by the end of the
year, he added.
Forstmann will acquire Ziff's business magazine group, which includes PC
Magazine, its flagship publication with a paid circulation of over 1m
copies. Also included in the deal are Ziff's recently formed consumer media
group, its international media group, a market research group and Ziff-Davis
Interactive, which provides on-line information to thousands of users.
Ziff's annual revenue of nearly Dollars 1bn and Dollars 160m in operating
profit comes largely from its computer trade magazines.
Forstmann said that it will invest over Dollars 900m of its own capital in
Ziff-Davis. The investment 'will facilitate the dynamic growth of this
business as the PC revolution continues to gather momentum', said Mr
Theodore Forstmann, senior partner.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Syrian talks make progress, says Clinton: Israelis
disappointed at meeting with Assad
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US president Bill Clinton said yesterday he had made significant progress in
talks with President Hafez al-Assad of Syria aimed at edging Israeli-Syrian
peace negotiations forward.
But the Israeli foreign ministry described the Clinton-Assad meeting as a
'great disappointment' and said Mr Clinton had boosted Mr Assad's prestige
in the Middle East by his visit but had come away empty-handed.
After four hours of talks with the Syrian president in Damascus, Mr Clinton
said he had made progress but was not free to discuss the details. He said
Mr Assad's remarks yesterday, in which he pledged to 'hasten the march of
peace', went beyond anything he had said before.
'Syria has made a strategic choice for peace with Israel. Syria is ready to
commit itself to the requirements of peace for the long term, to transform
the region from a state of war to a state of peace, and to allow Arab and
Israeli to live in security, prosperity and stability,' Mr Clinton said in a
speech to the Israeli parliament last night.
'I believe something is changing in Syria. Its leaders understand that it is
time to make peace. There will be still a good deal of hard bargaining
before a breakthrough but they are serious about proceeding . . . We will
walk with you on the road to Damascus for peace with security.'
Israeli officials, however, said Mr Assad had merely restated Syria's
hardline position demanding a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied
Golan Heights and had embarrassed the US president by saying that no US
official had ever proved Syrian involvement in an act of international
terror.
'For us the visit would have been a success if Clinton had been able to
broker direct talks between our foreign minister and the Syrian foreign
minister,' said a senior Israeli foreign ministry official. 'The least we
expected was something firm about terrorism.'
Mr Clinton said later he regretted that Mr Assad had not taken the
opportunity to publicly condemn acts of terror against Israelis.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said that although Mr Clinton had
brought no breakthrough, Israel would not be discouraged and would continue
to be patient and determined and pursue any avenue which remained open to
reach peace with Syria and Lebanon. Diplomats said Mr Assad was happy that
Mr Clinton had renewed US commitment to an Israeli withdrawal from all land
occupied in the West Bank, Arab East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and
southern Lebanon.
But Mr Rabin warned: 'Jerusalem is not open for negotiations. It is not a
matter for bargaining . . . Jerusalem was and will be the eternal capital of
the state of Israel, under Israeli sovereignty - the beating heart of the
Jewish people.'
Mr Clinton had to cancel his scheduled walkabout around Jerusalem in the
face of Palestinian opposition.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Aitken denial on hotel bill fails to stem sleaze storm:
Labour calls for public investigation - Police asked to examine blackmail
claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's bitter confrontation with Harrods' owner Mr Mohammed Fayed
erupted into a new political storm at Westminster yesterday as Mr Jonathan
Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, denied he had lied to the cabinet
secretary.
With Mr John Major's administration engulfed by new 'sleaze' charges, the
prime minister disclosed that police were investigating whether an
intermediary for Mr Fayed had sought to 'blackmail' the government.
The row prompted an angry clash in the House of Commons between Mr Major and
Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader. Mr Blair called for public investigation
of the allegations and demanded to know why Mr Major had earlier this week
sacked Mr Neil Hamilton as industry minister.
But in an exchange which marked an abrupt end to the 'new style of politics'
promised by both leaders, Mr Blair was accused by the prime minister of
descending into the 'gutter' of public life by giving credence to
unsubstantiated rumours. Opposition MPs in turn demanded that Mr Major order
Conservative Central Office to return the Pounds 250,000 Mr Fayed says he
paid to the party during the 1980s.
Mr Aitken's denial that he had allowed a business associate to pay some or
all of a bill for a two-day stay last year at the Ritz - the Paris hotel
owned by Mr Fayed - was reinforced by a letter to The Guardian newspaper
from Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary.
Commenting on suggestions that Mr Aitken had lied to him during an earlier
investigation, Sir Robin said: 'For the record, I do not regard Jonathan
Aitken as having lied to me or misled me.'
In a reference to Mr Aitken's Ritz account, Sir Robin told Mr Peter Preston,
the newspaper's editor: 'I am satisfied that, despite the discrepancies in
the billing to which you have devoted so much attention, Mr Aitken and his
wife paid their bill at the Ritz in full.'
In the Commons, Mr Aitken accused the newspaper of 'hysterical, sleaze
journalism'.
But Labour continued to demand an explanation of why Mr Aitken's account for
the Ritz stay shows only a FFr4,257 (Pounds 510) cash payment towards a
total bill of FFr8,010, transferred to the account of Mr Said Ayas, a former
business associate.
Downing Street declined to offer an explanation of the discrepancy between
the FFr4,257 cash payment made by Mr Aitken's wife and the FFr8010.90 cost
of Mr Aitken's two-night stay.
Amid growing concern among Tory MPs that the government's standing is being
seriously damaged by wave of claims of impropriety against a succession
ministers, Mr Fayed attacked Mr Aitken's explanation.
In a statement, Mr Fayed said he was 'surprised that the Cabinet secretary
had reached his decision without reference to me'. There is now no pretence
that there is open war between Mr Major and Mr Fayed, whose colleague, Mr
Michael Cole, said it was 'brave of him to take on the government'.
Chief Superintendent Roy Clark of London's Metropolitan Police has meanwhile
been asked to examine whether there should be a full-scale inquiry into the
manner in which the government learned that Mr Fayed was making allegations
about ministerial improprieties. The intermediary who took the allegations
to Mr Major is widely believed at Westminster to be Mr Brian Hitchen, editor
of the Sunday Express. He has declined to comment.
In a further twist last night to the wider controversy, Dame Angela Rumbold,
a Tory party vice-chairman, announced she was stepping down as an executive
director of political lobbyists Decision Makers.
Dame Angela, MP for Mitcham and Morden, quit after the Commons committee on
members' interests was asked to investigate her alleged role in Decision
Makers' lobbying for a Channel Tunnel rail link station at Ebbsfleet, in
Kent.

FT  28 OCT 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Fujitsu returns to
black as electronics sector recovers - Improved results at some of Japan's
leading groups / Electronics

Correction (published 1st November 1994) appended to this article.
Japan's large comprehensive electronics companies posted a firm recovery in
profits in the first six months of fiscal 1994 on the strength of
cost-cutting measures and buoyant demand for products. The rebound for the
manufacturers, who make a broad range of products from semiconductors and
televisions to computers and heavy electrical machinery, ended a painful
period of declining earnings lasting, in many cases, for three years.
Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer and parent of ICL, the
UK-based computer company, bounced back into the black with recurring
profits - before extraordinary items and tax - of Y22.13bn (Dollars 227m)
compared with a deficit of Y13.79bn at the same stage last year.
NEC saw recurring profits nearly triple to Y20.28bn from Y7.13bn while
Mitsubishi Electric's recurring profits surged 80 per cent to Y27bn.
The turnround came in spite of what the companies described as persistent
weakness in private capital spending amid a mild economic recovery in Japan
and a strong rise in the value of the yen.
The biggest boon for Japan's electrical makers was the strong demand this
year for electronic devices, particularly semiconductors and liquid crystal
display panels.
Japanese companies are leading world suppliers of memory chips and LCD
screens, which are seeing strong demand from the US personal computer
industry as PCs have been upgraded to advanced models which use more memory
and as the PC market has grown.
Fujitsu reported a 22 per cent rise in sales of electronic components,
including semiconductors.
Toshiba said semiconductor sales were up 14 per cent and sales in its
information systems and electronic devices division were up 16 per cent as a
result of strong demand for semiconductors and LCDs.
Other information equipment, such as cellular phones and car navigation
systems, enjoyed firm demand in Japan and are expected to support sales
ahead.
However, for the many integrated electrical machinery makers involved in
consumer electronics, demand from consumers for audio-visual products
remained sluggish overall, in spite of the income tax cut.
In addition, prices have fallen sharply in the consumer electronics market,
resulting in lacklustre profits even for companies which were able to
maintain unit sales.
For example, Toshiba said that air conditioner sales rose 50 per cent in
unit terms but due to weak prices the benefit to profits was insignificant.
Meanwhile, sales of TVs, video recorders and audio equipment remained weak
in the Japanese market and prices came under pressure from cheap imports.
The weakness of private capital spending was reflected in the results of
those companies' with substantial heavy electrical and industrial machinery
divisions.
Hitachi, for example, saw a 15 per cent decline in sales in its industrial
systems division.
Toshiba suffered a 30 per cent drop in its heavy electrical machinery
division, although that was largely on an absence of nuclear power plant
sales in the period.
The computer market was also, on the whole, a weak point for Japanese
companies. While PCs have been in demand in the Japanese market, prices have
fallen sharply.
Fujitsu said it expected unit sales to rise about 28 per cent to 30 per cent
but indicated that this would not translate directly into profit increases
due to the price falls.
Fujitsu saw consolidated sales in its information processing division fall 2
per cent due to the yen's rise and to a weak performance by ICL, which
suffered from stagnant sales in Europe, it said.
The companies have responded to pressures in their business environment by
cutting costs, shifting production overseas and procuring more parts from
low-cost bases abroad.
Toshiba, for example, began importing 14-inch TVs from Taiwan which it sells
in Japan under its own brand in an original equipment manufacturing
arrangement, the company said.
Fujitsu said it would shift more production overseas. Currently 17 per cent
of the company's overall sales is manufactured overseas.
The industry expects demand for semiconductors and LCDs to remain buoyant
for some time ahead.
On the back of expected strong semiconductor demand, NEC, Toshiba and
Fujitsu have all revised spending plans to reflect greater expenditure on
semiconductor facilities.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Plan for Hadrian's Wall trail criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government has approved the Countryside Commission's controversial plan
for an 81-mile national trail for walkers alongside Hadrian's Wall, Chris
Tighe writes.
The commission believes the route, along the former northern boundary of the
Roman Empire from Wallsend in Tyne and Wear to Bowness on Solway in Cumbria,
could bring more than Pounds 1m a year into the local economy from visitors.
But yesterday Mr Peter Atkinson, Tory MP for Hexham, said that the trail
would bring chaos to land and livestock management and questioned how much
economic benefit it would generate. Archaeologist Professor Peter Fowler of
Newcastle University condemned the plan to create a 'pedestrian motorway'
through a designated World Heritage Site.
Announcing the decision, Mr Robert Atkins, environment minister, said the
government was satisfied that the commission had taken full account of the
implications of establishing the path alongside the world heritage site.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: BCH drops sale of Azucarera
holding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Central Hispano, the Spanish banking group, has dropped plans to sell
its controlling 47% stake in General Azucarera, Spain's second-ranked sugar
company, to Saint-Louis, the French food and paper group, and to the UK's
Tate &amp; Lyle, after strong objections from the Spanish agriculture ministry,
which is determined to protect the domestic sector from outsiders.
The bank has also refused to sell its stake in Azucarera to a consortium,
backed by the ministry, which was led by Acor, a co-operative owned by
sugar-farmers and the third-largest domestic producer.
The stalemate is a setback for BCH, which is anxious to reduce its
industrial assets to inject greater liquidity into its core financial
business. Before the ministry stepped in, the bank had an agreement to sell
an initial 20 per cent of its Azucarera holding to Saint-Louis and Tate &amp;
Lyle, which jointly own 20 per cent of the sugar company, for Pta20bn
(Dollars 160m).
The counter-offer, which matched the Pta5,100 per Azucarera share agreed
with the foreign groups and bid for the entire BCH stake in the sugar
producer, was nevertheless unacceptable to BCH because it was supported by
Banco Popular.
The bank would have bought 10 per cent of Azucarera's equity and taken over
its banking business.
The rival bid was also resisted by Mr Jose Joaquin Ysasi-Ysamendi, Azucarera
chairman, who objected to being pushed by the government into the arms of
Acor, a group that has long been considered a maverick by the rest of
Spain's sugar sector because it has steadfastly refused to back media
campaigns and other joint initiatives organised by the domestic industry.
The row over BCH has raised questions over whether a Spanish group can sell
assets to whom it chooses, and whether foreign companies can buy freely into
Spanish companies.
The ministry argued that an Acor-led takeover of Azucarera, which accounts
for 23 per cent of the domestic sugar market, would protect Spain's sugar
quota in the EU.
The issue is a sensitive one, for the sugar sector represents one of Spain's
few triumphs over the common agricultural policy; the quota guaranteed to
Spanish producers slightly exceeds domestic demand and has a support price
somewhat above the EU average.
The argument received short shrift from Mr Ysasi-Ysamendi who said the
government was acting 'for all sorts of wrongheaded patriotic and
protectionist reasons'.

<TEXT>
Canada could fall apart as a country if Quebec votes for independence in a
referendum next year, according to Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Mr Chretien
has in the past tried to minimise the potential fallout if the separatist
government in French-speaking Quebec wins a referendum on independence from
Canada promised before the end of next year.
'Canada will have a big problem to survive,' Mr Chretien, a native French
speaker, said in an interview broadcast late on Wednesday from Vancouver.
The separatist Parti Quebecois won the provincial election in Quebec in
September, but with less than half of the popular vote. In the interview, Mr
Chretien also repeated his often stated belief Quebeckers will vote to stay
in Canada. Former prime minister Joe Clark also warned recently that the
rest of Canada could break up if Quebec separates.

Elections of more than 2,000 state and local officials originally planned
for December will probably be delayed until January, Mr Louis Dejoie,
Haitian Commerce Minister, said yesterday. Mr Dejoie, head of the centrist
PAIN party, said there would be no time to organise and plan the balloting
for mayoralties, local councils, all 83 members of the Chamber of Deputies
and nine of the 27 members of the Senate.
'I doubt they can be held in December,' Mr Dejoie said after talks with
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and other political leaders. 'They don't
have the time put things together.' Mr Dejoie and heads of 16 other
political parties met the president at the National Palace yesterday. A
further meeting is scheduled for November 3.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France and Canada have reached a compromise that could settle a dispute over
who should be the next secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). Under their proposal Frenchman
Jean-Claude Paye, who was seeking a third five-year term after his mandate
expired last month, would be reinstalled as head of the 25-nation economic
think-tank for two years. Donald Johnston, a former Canadian finance
minister and the candidate backed strongly by the US and most other
non-European members, would then serve a full five-year term.
The question now is whether the US will swallow the deal, a diplomat said.
The US is keen that the job should go to a non-European and diplomats said
the OECD dilemma may not be resolved until the contest for the top job at
the World Trade Organisation - the successor to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade - is over. Washington is promoting Mexico's President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who leaves office on November 30, for the the WTO
job.

Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street securities firm hit by heavy losses this
year, is to overhaul its system for compensating top executives in an
attempt to link pay more closely to performance.
The firm said the changes were also intended to make it easier to run its
various client-related businesses as a single global operation, and to
encourage better cost management.
Although the new system will only affect the firm's 125 or so highly-paid
managing directors in proprietary trading and client-driven businesses -
such as investment banking, securities sales and trading, and currencies -
their salaries and bonuses take up a significant share of Salomon's
compensation expenses.
While the bankers and traders in these core areas tend to be well-paid
whatever the circumstances, the revenues they generate can be volatile. This
often leaves the firm with a large wage bill, even when earnings are poor -
as has been the case this year, when Salomon in its first nine months lost
Dollars 547m on proprietary trading and other businesses. With the new pay
structure, Salomon's compensation expenses should move more in line with
performance.
Under the system, which will be introduced next year, managing directors in
the firm's client-driven businesses will receive a fixed minimum salary
equal to 35 per cent of this year's pay, plus 40 per cent of the earnings
their business generates in excess of an after-tax return to shareholders.
That return will initially be 7 per cent of equity capital, and will rise to
10 per cent over a two-year period.
Managing directors in Salomon's proprietary trading business, meanwhile,
will be paid from pooled deferred compensation accounts which accumulate pay
over a multi-year period. This could mean that traders may see their pay
from a good year subsequently reduced by losses incurred in a later, bad
year.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kimberly-Clark revises plans to
float pulp side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Kimberly-Clark, the Dallas-based maker of Kleenex tissues, is abruptly
revising its plans to float its North American pulp and newsprint
operations. The company said the sharp rise in pulp prices, unaccompanied by
a price increase for its finished products, made it in shareholders' best
interests to retain a majority stake for the time being.
Kimberly-Clark recently filed a preliminary prospectus in Canada for the 100
per cent flotation of a new company combining its pulp mill in Ontario and
its pulp and newsprint mill in Alaska.
Yesterday it said it would float only a third of the company, the earliest
date being the first quarter of 1995. Analysts had speculated that the
flotation could raise up to Dollars 950m. Kimberly-Clark is being advised by
Goldman Sachs and Salomon.
Kimberly-Clark had previously said it wanted to concentrate on its consumer
products business. It also needs cash to fund its expansion outside the US,
where its operations are still relatively small. Its bigger rival in the
tissue market, Scott Paper, said on Monday it would sell its pulp operations
as part of its own programme to focus on consumer products.
Last week Kimberly Clark's shares dropped almost 9 per cent in response to
third-quarter figures showing it was being hit hard by the cost of its
European expansion.

Acquisitions and a strong improvement in recycling prices helped
Browning-Ferris Industries, the US waste company, to report a 41 per cent
jump in annual net income to Dollars 278.7m, writes Peggy Hollinger.
Mr William Ruckelshaus, chairman and chief executive, said he was pleased
with the results, which included a 55 per cent increase in fourth-quarter
net income to Dollars 82.3m. Sales for the quarter were 34 per cent ahead at
Dollars 1.24bn, and 24 per cent up for the full year at Dollars 4.3bn.
'A successful acquisition programme, improved commodity prices and an
expanding economy contributed to these results,' he said.
BFI, which is pursuing a hostile Pounds 364m bid for Attwoods of the UK,
bought 25 companies during the final quarter, adding about Dollars 100m in
extra sales.
Net income per share rose to Dollars 1.49 from Dollars 1.15.

American Cyanamid, the US healthcare group which is being taken over by
American Home Products, recorded a Dollars 25.3m after-tax charge for the
merger, writes Richard Waters.
It also said it would pay a further Dollars 300m before tax to settle
employee stock options and what it called 'contingent investment advisory
fees'.
The first part of the merger costs reduced operating income to Dollars 22.1m
in the latest quarter, compared with Dollars 49.6m a year ago, while sales
rose 15 per cent to just over Dollars 1bn.

Shell Oil, the US arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said after-tax profits
before one-off factors rose by one-third, to Dollars 323m, in the three
months to the end of September, writes Richard Waters in New York.
Higher-than-expected production from the Augur field in the Gulf of Mexico
and lower exploration costs led to a Dollars 50m rise in operating income
from exploration and production, to Dollars 151m, before one-off charges.
In spite of the lower profit margins in the refinery business that have
afflicted the rest of the industry, the company reported a Dollars 9m
increase to Dollars 119m in underlying income from oil products, due to
volume increases. Operating income from chemicals also advanced, with income
climbing Dollars 33m to Dollars 100m.
Including all one-off factors, net income rose to Dollars 313m from Dollars
187m a year ago.

FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Benetton team wins GS-Autogrill
bidding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
An Italo-Swiss consortium, headed by Benetton, last night came away with the
winning bid for GS-Autogrill, the last part of the SME foodstuffs group to
be privatised.
The winning consortium consists of Edizione Holding, the Benetton family's
financial holding, plus the Swiss hotel and restaurant group, the Del
Vecchio group, and Crediop, the financial institution.
IRI, the state holding company, owns 62 per cent of SME. The bid was for 32
per cent of its stock, with the obligation to make a similarly priced offer
for at least a further 20 per cent held by minority shareholders. The winner
also then must buy up the remaining IRI shares.
No value was put on the deal but analysts estimate Autogrill is worth
L2,000bn (Dollars 1.31bn). IRI said it found the Benetton group's offer the
best and would present the decision to a shareholders' meeting on November
4.
The Benetton bid beat another offer on the table, from a Italian group
comprising Rinascente, the quoted Italian retail group, Ferrero, the
confectionery company and Fincomit, the merchant banking arm of Banca
Commerciale Italiana.
SME's shares were up 0.7 per cent at L4,086 yesterday ahead of the decision.
In the first half of this year SME's consolidated turnover was L2,026bn, up
4.7 per cent on the same period in 1993. Of this, L1,370bn came from the
stores side and L625bn from the restaurant business.
The award concludes a long and painful attempt by IRI to find a buyer for
SME's stores and motorway restaurant division. It also marks the end of the
messy break-up of SME. The state-run group was split into three divisions to
ease its privatisation in early 1993 - Italgel (frozen foods), Cirio Bertoli
De Rica (oil, canned goods, milk) and GS-Autogrill.
GS-Autogrill was first put out to private tender in September 1993 but the
sale was dropped because the offers were considered unsatisfactory.
A second attempt to sell was initiated in April this year, but in September
the process was revoked and new bids sought.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Reforms for The Law Commission
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Law Commission yesterday called for reforms to cut delays in handling
legal challenges to government decisions.
Judicial review applications have risen from 160 in 1974 to 1,500 by 1987
and almost 2,900 last year. The rise has continued this year, with 1,851
applications in the first seven months compared with 1,728 in the same
period of last year.
The government's law reform body said that if delays in hearing legal
challenges were to be reduced procedures for judicial review would have to
be streamlined.
It is proposing several changes to make procedures easier for applicants.
The terms and remedies available will be changed to make their function and
purpose more easily understood.
The commission also recommends that courts hearing public law cases should
have the power to order restitution where organisations or individuals have
wrongly been required to pay out money.
It says rules on time limits, the availability of interim remedies pending a
full hearing - in particular against ministers and central government
departments - and rules on appeals all need clarifying and updating.

The likely move follows consultations between the government and local

FT  28 OCT 94 / Burns criticised on Treasury cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Terry Burns, the perma-nent secretary of the Treasury, was last night
attacked for failing to consult opposition parties over cuts in his
department's manpower.
Mr Peter Mandelson, the Labour MP for Hartlepool who was this week tipped
for a key job in the Labour whips' office, accused Sir Terry of 'a
dereliction of duty' by not informing the Labour party about drastic
reductions in the number of Treasury civil servants.
In an adjournment debate on the civil service, Mr Mandelson said Sir Terry
needed to ensure that the Treasury machine remained fully operative for
subsequent administrations.
He insisted that Sir Terry should hold talks with Mr Gordon Brown, shadow
chancellor, well before the next general election to be fully briefed on the
party's economic plans.
'Upon a change of government, the Treasury will need to shift radically and
quickly to new priorities and ways of working,' he said. 'There wouldn't be
time to waste.'
Earlier this month Sir Terry announced a shake up of its structure, which
will involve the loss of about one in four senior staff.
Seventeen Labour MPs yesterday submitted an early-day motion calling for the
government to carry out a fundamental review of the beleaguered Child
Support Agency.
As concern grows about the agency's record in its first year in operation,
the MPs claimed that the organisation aimed to 'support the Treasury rather
than the child'.

FT  28 OCT 94 / Tourism industry seeks a fresh brochure for Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sell Britain as a modern society and the Americans will stay away. Stress
tea parties rather than castles if you want to attract the Japanese. And do
not mention Britain to the Irish. Urge them to come to England, Wales or
Scotland instead.
The conclusions were reached by the British Tourist Authority, which has
been conducting market research into how to reverse the fall in the UK's
share of world tourism.
Although a record 19.2m foreign visitors came to the UK last year, Britain's
share of world tourism earnings fell from 6.7 per cent in 1980 to 4.3 per
cent last year.
Researchers interviewed people in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York
to find out whether the authority should change its US projection of the UK
to that of a modern society rather than one steeped in history.
The answer was a categorical 'no'. Americans told researchers that Britain
conjured up images of bobbies, barristers, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey -
and they wanted it to stay that way.
Americans also said they found the British 'friendly but proper'. One said
he found the prospect of visiting the UK 'daunting' as he would have to be
on his best behaviour.
Research in Japan found that Britain's image was too masculine, making it
difficult to attract more Japanese women travellers.
Mr Keith Beecham, manager of the authority's Tokyo office, said the BTA was
concentrating on afternoon tea when selling Britain to the Japanese.
He said: 'The Japanese tend to associate Britain with heroic, masculine
castles. Our campaign is designed to create a softer and more feminine feel
 -quaint country house hotels, green landscapes and Laura Ashley. Afternoon
tea is the ideal vehicle.'
The authority placed a two-page advertisement in a Japanese newspaper
inviting people to buy tickets to a British tea party. It received 18,000
replies.
A survey in Ireland detected unsympathetic responses to the notion of
Britain. When asked about England, Scotland or Wales, the answers were far
warmer, so advertising was changed.

FT  28 OCT 94 / CBI stresses demand for curbs on pay settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry yesterday reinforced its recent
warnings about the upward drift in pay settlements, after saying that,
according to its pay databank, manufacturing pay awards had risen to 2.9 per
cent in the third quarter.
The latest figure compares with 2.6 per cent in the first quarter and 2.8
per cent in the second quarter but comes against the backdrop of an award of
more than 10 per cent over two years for most workers at Rover and the
rejection of a 7.5 per cent offer over two years at Jaguar.
Pay awards in service companies rose slightly from an average of 3.3 per
cent in the second quarter to 3.4 per cent in the third quarter. But the CBI
said that just under one in five manufacturers and one in nine service
companies were operating pay freezes for up to 12 months.
Mr Howard Davies, the CBI's director-general, said: 'While the increase in
pay awards is marginal, the slight upward shift over the last six months
gives cause for concern.'
Productivity expectations suggest that unit labour costs are continuing to
fall with an average increase in productivity of 5 per cent expected in the
coming 12 months.
Nevertheless Mr Davies said that Britain was no longer matching the pace of
key competitors such as the US and Germany, which were experiencing unit
labour cost falls of 2 per cent and 3 per cent a year.
He said the figures reinforced the need to curb the upward creep in pay
awards.

The call is an embarrassment to the nationalist party's four MPs who are
strongly opposed to such a policy.

<TEXT>
Hughes Aircraft, a General Motors subsidiary, described as 'irrational,
irresponsible and outrageous' the Dollars 89.5m damages award against the
company handed down this week by a Los Angeles jury. In the case, which
involves two former Hughes employees, one white and one black, the company
was found to have violated fair employment laws. Hughes intends to appeal
and legal experts said the award would almost certainly be reduced
substantially.
The award comes amid a rash of discrimination and harassment suits. In
another high profile case the US Labor Department, which is supposed to be a
watchdog against workplace discrimination, agreed to pay an estimated
Dollars 4.9m to settle a suit that accused the agency of discrimination
against its own black employees. Businesses complain that despite efforts to
eliminate bias in the workplace, increasingly restrictive laws make it very
hard to comply.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Cuban demands for Washington to start unravelling US transport, financial
and trade sanctions against the island fell on deaf American ears during
direct talks in Havana this week on immigration issues. In a tactic that
clearly exasperated the Cubans, the US stonewalled all Cuban efforts to make
the embargo an issue at the talks, which reviewed a September 9 bilateral
immigration accord.
'I don't see how you can really proceed to an expanded programme of normal
immigration if you have reduced flights and other restrictions,' said Cuba's
chief negotiator, Mr Ricardo Alarcon. He was referring to curbs on flights
and dollar cash remittances to Cuba introduced on August 20 by President
Bill Clinton to tighten Washington's embargo.
The US wants Cuba to introduce political reforms, such as legalising
opposition parties, and to improve human rights.
The talks in Havana ended inconclusively on Wednesday night after three
days. Both delegations said they were satisfied with progress made in some
areas, such as a US commitment to quickly introduce accelerated visa
procedures.
Mr Alarcon said the talks had identified some problem areas that still
needed to be resolved. He gave no details but differences had emerged during
the talks over exactly how to deal with 32,000 Cuban refugees sheltering at
US safe havens at Guantanamo Bay in eastern Cuba and in Panama.
Meanwhile, Wednesday's overwhelming but widely expected United Nations
General Assembly vote against the US economic embargo on Cuba was being
hailed by the Havana government yesterday.

Qatar and Kuwait have agreed to provide bases for additional US armour and
attack jets in a Gulf build-up to prepare for any new military threat from
Iraq, the US Defence Department said yesterday.
Qatar will accept the positioning of tanks and supplies for use by a brigade
of over 2,000 US troops should the need arise again to send American
soldiers to the Gulf. A squadron of about 24 A-10 attack jets, slow flying
and heavily armed aircraft designed to smash tanks, will also be sent to
Kuwait. Defence officials said they considered the agreement with Qatar a
breakthrough in the Pentagon's push to position more heavy armour in the
region to meet any potential Iraqi threat or build-up.
Qatar was used as a base for F-16s during the 1991 Gulf War. 'Qatar has
allowed us to put in a full brigade's worth of equipment,' the Pentagon
said. 'A squadron of A-10s will be deployed in Kuwait.' The US is now
seeking to store enough armour on the ground in the Gulf region for three
brigades representing about a division of 10,000 troops.

Italy, is the only EU member state not to have named its two appointees and

FT  28 OCT 94 / France curbs welfare spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The French government has made progress in its attempts to curb welfare
spending, but the social security accounts may need extra funding to avoid
cashflow problems in the first half of 1995, according to a report released
yesterday. The report by the social security accounts committee forecast
that the deficit on welfare spending, which includes health, pensions and
family benefits, should narrow to FFr50.5bn (Pounds 6bn) next year, from
about FFr54bn in 1994 and FFr56.4bn in 1993. According to the report,
however, the deficit would still exceed existing borrowing conditions agreed
with the Caisse des Depots, the state financial institution. The government,
which wrote off social security debts of an accumulated FFr110bn last year
by transferring them to the central state budget, has so-far resisted a
further injection of funds. Prior to the write-off, the government
implemented cost-cutting measures in the state pension scheme and in health
spending aimed at balancing the social security accounts.

FT  28 OCT 94 / BAT bid for American Tobacco facing US court block
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Federal Trade Commission said yesterday it would seek to block BAT
Industry's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) takeover bid for American Tobacco
because the deal could lead to reduced competition and 'co-ordinated'
pricing among US cigarette makers.
The FTC said it would ask a federal court in New York on Monday to halt the
takeover until a full 'administrative trial and any appeals' had been heard.
A trial could start within a few weeks with a verdict before the year-end.
BAT, the UK tobacco and financial services group, and American Brands, the
US consumer products group selling American Tobacco, said they would jointly
fight the FTC.
'We think the creation of a stronger number three manufacturer will be
beneficial to consumers,' BAT said. 'It's a setback but we have had them
before with American takeovers.'
It took BAT a year to win approval to buy Farmers, a California insurer, in
1988 in the face of hostility from state regulators.
BAT's Brown and Williamson subsidiary, the maker of Kool and other brands,
is the number three cigarette manufacturer in the US. However, buying
fourth-placed American Tobacco, maker of Carlton and Lucky Strike, would
lift its market share from 11 per cent to 18 per cent. Number one is
Marlborough-selling Philip Morris with more than 40 per cent and second is
the Reynolds subsidiary of RJR-Nabisco with about 30 per cent.
The deal would also have the effect of reuniting the Lucky Strike brand,
which is owned by American Tobacco in the US but by BAT outside the US.
The trade commissioners, acting on their staff's recommendation, said the
deal would remove one of the six manufacturers left in the US, a market
'highly concentrated and largely shielded from new entrants'.
In the past, American Tobaccohas not followed other manufacturers' price
increases so its takeover would 'remove an aggressive competitor', the FTC
said, 'and increase the chances of co-ordinated actions among the remaining
manufacturers'.
'This is not a picture of the market we'd recognise,' BAT said.
It and American Tobacco had each delivered some one million pages of
documents to the FTC and held meetings with its staff since the deal was
announced in April.
In recent weeks BAT began to realise the staff were hostile to the takeover
but it hoped the commissioners would overrule them.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Elkem improves to NKr198m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, reported a sharp rise in
nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr198m from NKr64m, helped by increased demand
for its main products.
However, the rebound in aluminium prices failed to benefit the group because
it had secured fixed-price, long-term contracts and forward hedging
agreements in 1993 under softer prices.
Primary aluminium prices shot up 40 per cent in 1994 and yesterday hit
Dollars 1,800 a tonne on the London Metals Exchange, thanks in part to cuts
in capacity by western producers which has contributed to lower stocks and
firmer demand.
At the end of last year, when LME aluminium prices were Dollars 1,125 a
tonne, Elkem signed contracts covering a large part of 1994 production, but
based on 1993 prices. Elkem would not disclose contractual arrangements for
1994 sales.
The company plans to cut aluminium output by 10,000 tonnes from the fourth
quarter and into 1995.
Elkem intends to seek board approval for a four-year NKr250m investment
programme for its Lista aluminium plant in Norway, for which annual capacity
will be upgraded by 10,000 tonnes and improvements to environmental
standards made.
Nine-month group operating profit rose to NKr333m from NKr282m but the
advance was stemmed by slightly weaker third-quarter operating profits
compared with the previous two quarters. Elkem blamed this on a seasonal
drop in sales during the summer and price reductions for ferrosilicon and
manganese alloys.
Elkem said Norway's difficult energy market had contributed to unusually
high prices for power supply during the summer and that it was disappointed
by lower-than-expected progress in improving productivity and cost savings.
Operating costs rose to NKr5.8bn from NKr5.2bn.
The company expects demand for main products to continue to develop
favourably.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Banco Santander begins to reap Banesto benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander is heading for record profits this year after the Pta281bn
(Dollars 2.2bn) acquisition last April of Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto), the troubled bank whose board was sacked by the Bank of Spain
late last year.
Santander's profits for the first nine months of Pta107bn, after including
Banesto, are the highest result ever posted by a Spanish banking group for
this period. Without Banesto, Santander's pre-tax profits were Pta100.5bn,
5.9 per cent up on the same period last year.
The consolidation of Banesto, formerly the fourth biggest Spanish bank,
raised Santander's average total assets from Pta9,270bn to Pta16,827bn,
outstripping those of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), the next biggest domestic
banking group, by more than Pta4,000bn.
Banesto was consolidated in August, after the formal completion of the
acquisition. Mr Emilio Botin, Santander's chairman, said the subsidiary
bank's performance over the past two months had 'confirmed the favourable
forecasts of Banesto's future and vindicated a strategy designed to
consolidate a wide and solid client base in the Spanish market'.
Santander's figures indicated that it had so far been able to absorb Banesto
without appreciably damaging its balance sheet.
Santander's return on equity stood at 19.58 per cent excluding Banesto and
at 19.73 per cent including it.
The group's return on assets was 1.01 per cent without Banesto and dropped
marginally to 0.98 per cent with Banesto.
Non-performing loans as a percentage of banking group's total amounted to
6.37 per cent against 3.19 per cent if Banesto is not included in the
consolidated results.
Despite the higher figure resulting from Banesto's inclusion, coverage stood
at 79.14 per cent and at 100.61 per cent if real guarantees are taken into
account.
Santander posted a net interest margin of Pta220bn including Banesto.
Without Banesto, it was Pta188bn, 6 per cent higher than last year's third
quarter.
Without Banesto, Santander increased its operating profit by 10.8 per cent
to Pta118bn. Banesto's addition to the consolidated account lifted the
group's operating profit to Pta126bn.
The high totals posted by Santander came in spite of strong losses in
treasury operations. Income from fixed income and currency dealings fell
from Pta74bn in the first nine months of 1993 to Pta7.5bn, including
provisions of Pta13.5bn.
Banesto was the object of a large rescue plan which included a Pta180bn
capital injection, the purchase of Pta285bn worth of damaged assets by the
Deposit Guarantee Fund, and a zero-interest loan of Pta315bn to offset
current losses.
Yesterday's results indicated that Banesto was already earning money for
Santander. It added just over Pta9bn to the Santander group's third-quarter
net profits of Pta80bn although the overwhelming proportion of this
contribution was provided by Banesto's 25 per cent stake in the profitable
Portuguese bank Totta &amp; Acores.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Asia will continue to outpace global economic growth next year, even though
its projected expansion in gross domestic product of 7.3 per cent will be
slightly lower than this year's 7.8 per cent, according to latest estimates
by economists at the Asian Development Bank.
China is forecast to record a 9 per cent growth rate, down from 11.5 per
cent this year. That figure is topped only by Vietnam's 9.6 per cent
expected growth.
Collectively, the region's newly industrialising economies (Hong Kong, South
Korea, Singapore and Taiwan) are expected to turn in a slower growth of 6.9
per cent, from this year's 7.1 per cent.
The developing economies of South-East Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) are forecast to advance by a higher
average rate of 7.7 per cent, from this year's 7.3 per cent, according to
the ADB.
Mr Malcolm Dowling, assistant chief economist at the Manila-based ADB,
attributes the continued expansion mainly to 'the modest recovery' in global
production that will push up overall demand.
Mr Dowling presented these forecasts at the opening yesterday of a three-day
ADB workshop on Asia's economic outlook. Representatives from the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund also presented studies pointing to a
'broadening' and 'acceleration' of the nascent recovery in industrial
economies.
Economists from the three institutions said the current turbulence in world
financial markets will not jeopardise the continuing growth in Asian
economies. Mr Dowling cited particularly the Asian economies' strong savings
and investment rates that have been instrumental in achieving steady growth
records.
The ADB study also noted the 'phenomenal' rate of net resource flows
(including grant aid) to the developing countries of the region.

<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician,
yesterday renewed his legal battle against Credit Lyonnais, the troubled
state-owned bank to which he owes an estimated FFr1.2bn (Pounds 140m). In a
packed courtroom of the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris, Mr Tapie's
lawyers argued that Credit Lyonnais should be forced to stick by the terms
of a deal it reached with him in March this year to repay his loans over
five years. Credit Lyonnais argues the agreement is void because he did not
supply the necessary expert opinions in time to support the high value he
claimed for the assets against which the accord was secured. The bank
already has custody of many of Mr Tapie's assets, including shares, his
furniture collection, his yacht and his house in Paris. Valuations suggest
they may be worth substantially less than his debts, with one putting them
at FFr300m. Judgment is expected in several weeks.

cash-for-questions controversy by meeting Lord Nolan, chairman of the
nascent standing committee on standards in public life.

FT  27 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had another day of wide swings, ending the session back
under 3,000 in much reduced volume, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract rose steadily through most of the morning
but peeled off in the final couple of hours, diving steeply in the dying
moments of the day's trading.
Against a 3,040 best of the day, the contract was 2,993 at the official 4:10
close, down 16 points. At this level the premium to the cash market was 10
points with fair value premium around 14 points.
Activity was dull with 10,594 contracts comparing bleakly with the previous
day's 18,600 contracts. Most of this was concentrated into the morning
session.
Afternoon trading was left mostly to the whim of smaller deals but there was
an upsurge of excitement right at the close when two big sell orders from
two major houses went through.
Traded options activity edged ahead with 50,760 lots, against 49,676 lots on
Monday. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted for around 20,500 lots.
British Steel stood out among individual stock options, turning over 8,100
lots, or more than twice as much as the second busiest stock option, Marks
and Spencer (3,084 lots).
Thames Water, Hanson and Sainsbury were also active.

FT  27 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bass wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bass again stood out among brewers as a combination of yield buying and some
finger crossing on the budget helped lift the shares 8 to 544p on turnover
of 2.5m for a two-day advance of 12.
There were signs yesterday that yield-hungry buyers were moving in ahead of
Bass's traditional chunky final dividend. The 1993-94 results are due at the
end of next month and analysts expect the final payment could be edged up to
15p a share.
Bass is market leader with 23 per cent of UK beer sales, and yesterday
tentative hopes for a reduction in beer duty in the November budget showed
signs of gaining ground. However, stockmarket opinion here is polarised.
Resilience of Vodafone stock, up a penny at 199p contrasted with losses in
both BT and Cable &amp; Wireless, was attributed by marketmakers to strong
support from Hoare Govett, the stockbroker.
Hoare's telecoms team was said to have been promoting Vodafone shares on the
view that the company will come up with a rapidly improving performance in
Germany and following recent excellent figures from US cellular companies.
The broker was said to have highlighted the expansion of Vodafone's E Plus
subsidiary in Eastern Germany and its highly competitive tariff across the
whole of Germany. Vodafone launched E Plus in May this year and is expected
to cover 60 per cent of Germany by the end of the year. Hoare was said to
have put a valuation of Dollars 1.3bn on E Plus.
The bulls got the better of the long standing two-way pull in P&amp;0, pushing
the shares up 8 to 602p in turnover of 2.6m following a major assessment of
the company by UBS.
The securities house reiterates its buy stance, pointing to strong yield and
the 85 per cent of operating profits that arise from business other than
cross channel ferries. According to UBS, P&amp;0 is the third highest yielding
Footsie share.
BTR was again the most actively traded Footsie share, gaining 1 to 302p in
16m of turnover which compared with 14m trades on Tuesday. Much of the
activity stemmed from the exercise of 28m warrants at 288p each with
substantial batches of the newly created shares said to have changed hands.
The oil majors attracted solid support in the US overnight and again at the
outset yesterday as institutions responded to the encouraging numbers from
the US majors and the prospect of good third quarter numbers from Shell Oil
this afternoon. Dealers said the market was looking for 'clean' profits in
excess of Dollars 320m, against a comparable Dollars 239m, from Shell.
Shell Transport moved up 6 to 700p, after turnover of 3.2m while BP settled
2 1/2 up at 413 1/2 p on good turnover of 8.3m.
Mining group RTZ slipped 7 to 847p as Panmure Gordon reiterated its sell
stance.
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome shed 11 to 622p with traders saying that
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which reiterated its negative stance
on the company earlier in the week, had a sizeable sell order on its books.
Meanwhile SmithKline Beecham improved 2 1/2 to 405 1/2 p in the 'A's as
reports in the US press gave suggested that the purchase of drugs
distributor DPS would go ahead as planned. There had been suggestions that
the US Food and Drug Administration was concerned about the acquisition.
Motor parts services group Kwik-Fit put on 2 to 151p on news of a Pounds
9.5m takeover which increases outlets numbers by more than a sixth to around
800. Among motor distributor, Cowie gained 7 to 212p with the shares
bouncing from what analysts saw as an earlier oversold position.
Prudential Corporation put on the best individual performance in the FT-SE
100 as the market responded positively to news of a 15 per cent upturn in
worldwide new business figures. Prudential shares jumped 10, or 3.3 per
cent, to 308p, on turnover of 4.8m.
Elsewhere in life assurance stocks Legals edged up 5 to 433p. Lloyds Abbey
Life, given a rough ride by the market in the run up to the SIB report, were
heavily traded and settled 10 higher at 336p. Britannic edged up 3 to 407p,
London and Manchester eased 2 to 318p and Refuge dipped a penny to 275p.
United Friendly retreated 15 to 483p.
In the composites area Commercial Union moved up 6 to 524p, as did General
Accident, 556p. TSB was the second heaviest traded stock in the market after
Smith New Court, the securities house bought a block of 5.7m shares at 210p
and placed the majority at 212p.
The recent big buyer of Standard Chartered made a series of fleeting
appearances in the market, helping stabilise the shares which closed only a
shade easier at 278p;turnover of 1.1m was well below recent levels. Dealers
pointed to heavy options activity in HSBC whose shares moved up 4 1/2 to 699
1/2 p. Merchant bank SG Warburg took another tumble, falling 14 to 600p
reflecting uncertainty across the range of both global bond and equity
markets.
Supermarket chain J. Sainsbury was weak early in the day with dealers saying
Morgan Stanley had cut its forecast ahead of half-year figures next
Wednesday. However, the shares rallied later to close 2 firmer at 386p.

FT  27 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market awaits ICI news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is still a conviction among London's financial community that ICI is
the symbol of Britain's industrial well-being and the market hung fire ahead
of the chemical giant's third-quarter figures today.
The FT-SE 100 closed flat and ICI were virtually unchanged at 799p as the
stock market waited for what one dealer described as: 'The most sensitive
figures for three years, both for ICI and for the market.'
The range of forecasts for the company's pre-tax profits is unusually wide
reflecting the divergent views on the direction of the UK economy. The
bulls, who believe the company might produce profits as high as Pounds 145m,
argue that the rise in commodity prices will be reflected in ICI's figures
before being passed through downstream companies such as BTR and Yule Catto
to be reflected in the economy as a whole.
The bears, who are looking for around Pounds 120m, believe that the pick-up
in commodity prices has already been factored into the market - ICI shares
have outperformed the FT-SE A All Share Index by more than 15 percentage
points since the beginning of March - and the stock is due for a correction.

FT  27 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains eliminated following
gilts auction - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Markets Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong selling of stock index futures at the close of trading yesterday hit
a UK stock market where early gains had already been almost eliminated
following a very poor response to the auction of Pounds 2.5bn of five-year
British government bonds. The FT-SE 100 Index slipped below the 3,000 mark
again in the final minutes and traders expressed pessimism ahead of this
morning's opening.
Equities were helped at first by a brightening of the currency scene after
the French Economic Minister professed readiness to join in any dollar
support plans and the governor of the Bank of Japan rejected suggestions
that the US was acquiescing in a weak dollar.
With long-dated UK bonds firmer in line with other bond markets on the
improved dollar sentiment, the Footsie had gained 28.8 points by
mid-morning. But 3,029.7 proved to be the day's high point as first reports
from the gilts auction reached the stock market.
The market's advance was quickly routed. A brief rally as Federal bonds
responded to a gain of only 0.1 per cent in US durable goods orders for
September proved a false dawn and markets turned off again in London and New
York as interest rate worries resurfaced in nervous equity markets.
By the close, when losses in UK gilts were half a point down on the day, the
FT-SE 100 Share Index was a net 1 point off at 2,999.9. The sudden rush of
selling in the futures market drove the December futures contract on the
FT-SE Index down to 2,993. Some traders perceived a turn for the worse in
futures trading over the past few sessions.
London dealers warned that the UK market could face a difficult opening this
morning after the auction of five year Federal notes overnight; the
Bundesbank policy council meets today and tomorrow brings the gross domestic
product statistics in the US. The Dow Industrial Average was 9 points down
when London closed for the day.
The withdrawal of buying support across the full range of the market brought
a further fall of 7.4 points in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index which closed
3,467.2. Business in non-Footsie stocks made up around 60 per cent of the
day's total of 517.4m shares through the Seaq electronic network, itself a
dip of just over 9 per cent from the previous session.
The UK market faces important trading statements today from several blue
chip companies likely to provide a lead for the market. The insurance sector
performed well for most of yesterday's session, with dealers taking the view
that the generally negative report on pension fund sales from the Securities
Investment Board largely taken into share prices already.
Oil shares also performed well as good results from the US oil firms
outweighed any worries over the US currency. Recommendations from
stockbroking analysts brought a number of firm spots across the range.
Consumer and retail issues stood up well in spite of the warning on
inflationary pressures this week from the Confederation of British Industry.
The London securities arm of UBS warned clients that while the CBI survey
took place against a background of continued strong growth in the UK
economy, the recent gross domestic product statistics had suggested that the
pace of growth was slowing. Moreover, said UBS, the survey's references to
capacity shortages and unit cost pressures suggested that the medium term
outlook for inflation could be 'distinctly gloomy.'
However, Paribas Capital Markets, forecasting Footsie at 3,300 at the end of
the year, believes that base rates will remain at current levels until then.
It claims that market perceptions that that significant increases in
inflation and interest rates are threatened is 'right in principle but
likely .. to be hopelessly wrong in degree.'

FT  27 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Early gains evaporate on
interest rate fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCKS attempted to rally yesterday morning but the early gains
evaporated amid nagging concerns over interest rates, writes Frank McGurty
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 2.36 lower at 3,848.23, but the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.09 at 462.61, even though
declining issues held a four-to-three edge over advances on the Big Board.
Volume was heavy, with about 322m shares traded on the NYSE.
In the other leading markets, the American SE composite added 0.68 at
453.53, and the Nasdaq composite improved 4.98 to 763.24.
Stocks opened solidly higher, with the market trying to reverse direction
after four losing sessions. There was relative tranquility in early trading
in the bond and foreign exchange markets, and the day's only piece of
economic news failed to excite much interest.
The commerce department reported that factory orders of durable goods rose
just 0.1 per cent in September after a big gain the previous month. Analysts
had forecast a 0.6 per cent rise, but with most investors holding off on
fresh commitments, at least until after Friday's reading on third- quarter
economic growth, the data had virtually no impact.
Concerns over an imminent move by the Federal Reserve to lift short-term
rates, and the move in long-term rates above 8 per cent, were never far from
the surface. By early afternoon the jitters got the best of the market, and
most share prices were showing modest losses.
Later the blue chips swung into positive territory on a fleeting upturn in
bonds, only to sag anew in the final hour.
The session brought a few more pleasant earnings surprises. Most notably,
Ford showed an impressive gain in net income and revenues, in contrast with
General Motors, which last week revealed details of a disappointing third
quarter. But Ford's share price could only manage to inch Dollars 1/8 ahead
to Dollars 29 1/8. GM was off Dollars 1/2 at Dollars 40 3/4, and Chrysler
added Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 47 7/8.
Tenneco, a diversified industrial group, posted net income which had nearly
doubled from the year earlier and topped the consensus forecast of analysts.
However, the issue, up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 43 1/2 , hardly budged. By
contrast, its Case farm equipment business, which reports separately, jumped
Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 20 5/8 on strong results.
Sara Lee, a food processor, also impressed investors with solid gains in net
income and revenues in its first fiscal quarter. Its share price climbed
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 24. Borden added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 13 5/8
even though it reported another loss and slashed its dividend. Philip Morris
gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 63 7/8 .
In pharmaceuticals, McKesson surged Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 105 1/4 after
Eli Lilly extended the waiting period for its tender offer for the company's
shares until November 3. Lilly dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 60.

FT  27 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Decline in premium on UBS
registered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lack of sustained recovery in the dollar, treasuries and the Dow weighed
inevitably on domestic bond markets and on bourses yesterday. Early rebounds
in European equities were cut back hard, disappeared altogether or turned
into further losses, writes Our Markets Staff.
ZURICH took a pragmatic, and painful look at the dollar and a weaker Wall
Street, and dropped the SMI index by 17.5 to 2,477.2. Sandoz registered fell
SFr10 to a new 1994 low SFr612 after its news of a 3 per cent rise in
nine-month sales, aminimal gain emphasising the way that dollar depreciation
has bit into European growth rates this year.
At the same time UBS registered fell SFr13, or 4.4 per cent to SFr282 with
the bearers down only SFr5 at SFr1,230, thus reducing the premium on the
registered from 19.4 to 14.6 per cent; professionals said that this
reflected the increasing prospect of the UBS board, which wants to create a
single class of registered share, winning its power struggle with Mr Martin
Ebner's BK Vision.
FRANKFURT offered a futures-led, technical rebound on the session, the Dax
index rising 45.87, or 2.3 per cent to 2,020.50. About half of the recovery
reflected post-bourse gains on Tuesday.
By the end of the afternoon, however, the mood was looking much less
ebullient, with the Ibis-indicated Dax up 13.60 at 2,009.45. The December
Dax future moved from 2,030.0, up 13.5 at the session's close to 2,017.5, up
a solitary point at the end of the day.
Turnover eased from DM7bn to DM5.5bn. The share of the day was Mannesmann,
up DM11 at DM385.50 with a major foreign order reported after a period of
weakness.
Mr Michael Geiger at NatWest Securities in London said that NatWest had
estimated an earnings rise for Mannesmann from DM28.10 in 1995 to DM44.60 in
1998, by which time more than half of group profits should come from the
mobile telephone side of the business.
PARIS stayed in positive territory, the CAC-40 index finishing 7.12 higher
at 1,831.54 after a fall from a session high of 1,852. Turnover remained
modest at FFr3bn.
Accor was lifted FFr38 to FFr545 following an analysts meeting, and in spite
of reporting first half figures earlier in the week which were at the lower
end of expectations.
Paribas Capital Markets commented that it had provisionally cut its
forecasts for the hotel group, and thought it likely that the dividend would
be cut in 1994 and 1995.
However, the broker concluded that it was mildly positive on the stock,
thinking that most of the bad news was now in the share price although it
warned that a big rights issue was likely in the near future.
The group said that it intended to make divestments totalling FFr2.5bn by
the end of 1995, and to cut long term debt to FFr22.4bn by the end of this
year and to FFr21.5bn by the end of 1995.
AMSTERDAM wavered before the AEX index put on a marginal 0.95 to 399.15,
after a high of 401.63.
James Capel observed that Amsterdam had been one of the best European equity
markets in the third quarter, helped by better than expected half year
results and optimistic management statements. But, the broker warned,
following 'a very strong period of prolonged outperformance within Europe,
the equity market could gradually become the victim of profit-taking and
asset reallocation by international investors'.
Foreign investors, particularly from the US and UK, turned sellers of the
market during the second and third quarters. Capel concluded that while a
rally was to be expected in the short-term following the good batch of
company reports, a pause in activity was likely in the first quarter of
1995.
Nedlloyd saw more bargain hunting following falls last week, up a further Fl
3.00 or 6 per cent to Fl 52.20. DSM rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 146.80, ahead of next
week's third quarter results.
MILAN fell back slightly in a dull session. The Comit index drifted down
3.37 at 610.41.
Trading in Fiat and Generali accounted for about 30 per cent of the day's
total turnover of L500bn, with the former rising L5 to L5,995, and the
insurer losing L413 to L36,700.
Olivetti shed L42 to L1,752; Goldman Sachs considered the stock fairly
valued in the L1,800 to L2,100 range, said that it was maintaining its
'market performer' rating on the stock and remarked that the prospects of a
rights issue were likely to put a constraint on long-term performance.
MADRID registered yet another low for the year, the general index falling
0.65 to 288.65 in turnover of Pta20bn.
There were winners, on the margin. Santander, in banks, and Endesa in
utilities produced nine month figures and rose Pta45 to Pta5,010 and Pta20
to Pta5,520 respectively, Santander on profits up 5.6 per cent excluding the
Banesto acquisition and Endesa on a 13.5 per cent gain at net level.
WARSAW continued to mourn the imposition of a 0.3 per cent transaction tax,
and the Wig index fell for the fourth time in succession, by 237.4 or 2.8
per cent to 8,259.7.
Turnover dropped 17 per cent to 579bn zlotys. The steel trader, Stalexport,
fell on its initial listing to 335,000 zlotys cum dividend from an issue
price of 340,000.

Shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange ended mixed with gold shares
closing lower as buyers turned their attention to industrials.
The industrial index turned around from a weak opening to close 34 points up
at 6,572, offsetting a 21 point fall on the gold index to 2.280. The overall
index improved 5 to 5,706.
Brokers said that buyers returned to industrials on bargain hunting based on
the view that the fall in recent days had been overdone. Among golds dealers
said prices continued to drift lower as the price of bullion failed to
recover above Dollars 390 an ounce.
Barlows rose R1 at R32.00 while the petrochemical group, Sasol, finished 65
cents higher at R35.90.

FT  27 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Philippine equity rollercoaster reaches
plateau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In common with the Asian region in general the Philippine equity market has
seen a rollercoaster year's trading so far, although in recent weeks it
seems to have regained some composure, writes John Pitt. After a gain of 150
per cent in 1993 the stock market index fell sharply in the early months of
the year on a combination of profit-taking and alarm over the rise in US
interest rates. During the summer a number of IPOs drained some Dollars
1.7bn of liquidity, depressing investor sentiment further, but confidence
has returned recently on the back of strong first half company earnings and
good economic prospects.
Kim Eng Securities is optimistic on the future direction of equities in
Manila and expects corporate earnings to grow by 53.3 per cent and 34.5 per
cent in 1994 and 1995 respectively. The broker forecasts a year-end index
level of 3,600, compared to yesterday's close of 3,068.
The IFC has launched three new tradeable indices, the IFC100, Asia50 and
Latin50, which comprise the largest and most actively traded stocks in the
world's emerging markets. The indices, calculated daily in dollar terms,
are, says the IFC, 'designed to be reliable indicators of day-to-day stock
price movement in the overall asset class and in two of the major geographic
regions'.
The market capitalisation of the IFC100 was Dollars 222.4bn at the end of
September, compared to a market capitalisation of Dollars 501.9bn for the
IFC investable composite.

<TEXT>
Share prices finished slightly higher in subdued trading ahead of Japan
Tobacco's listing today, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 index added 14.20 to 19,746.35 after a high of 19,770.75 and
a low of 19,705.94. Dealers, who had closed their positions for this month
on Tuesday, remained inactive on the last day of trading for October
settlements.
Volume remained flat at 218m shares. Only some short term speculators were
actively picking up small capital issues. Overseas investors remained
inactive due to the continued strength of the yen.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.46 to 1,566.94 and the
Nikkei 300 edged down 0.22 to 286.60. Losers led gainers by 509 to 426 with
222 issues remaining unchanged.
In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.68 to 1290.03.
Strong interim earnings results from companies made no difference to their
share price performance. Smith New Court Japan reported that equities had
already discounted the fiscal year 1994 results, adding that this had been
confirmed by the lack of response to upward profit revisions in September.
The broker expected the Nikkei to rise to between 21,500 to 22,000 by the
end of the calendar year.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y4,000 to Y886,000 on reports that a
large number of employees had applied for the the company's early retirement
scheme.
Japan Telecom, which listed last month and is regarded as an indicator of
investor confidence towards Japan Tobacco, fell to an intraday low of Y3.72m
before closing unchanged at Y3.75m.
Nippon Television Network jumped Y800 to Y24,200 on reports of a sharp
increase in profits due to a recovery in advertising revenue.
Domestic institutional investors sold Mitsubishi Oil, which fell Y10 to
Y1,060. Ashimori Industry, an maker of air-bags for motor vehicles, rose Y16
to Y670 amid speculation that a large car manufacturer was buying its stock.
Sega Enterprises rose Y70 to Y4,900, recovering earlier losses prompted by
concerns over intensifying competition in the video game market.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 65.46 to 21,952.09 in volume of 38.6m shares.
Aoyama Trading fell Y150 to Y2,890 and Shimano, the bicycle parts maker,
declined Y100 to Y1,820 on fears of lower profits due to the higher yen.
Roundup
Shanghai's domestic equity market performed more acrobatics yesterday, but
for international investors the Pacific Basin was unusually subdued, lifted
in places by demand for telecommunications majors.
HONG KONG had the slowest trading session since early July. Turnover dropped
from HKDollars 2.37bn to a preliminary HKDollars 1.96bn, the Hang Seng index
gained 5.94 at 9,252.44 but declines beat advances by 250 to 180. A good
reception to a flat sale by its property unit helped lift Swire Pacific A 75
cents to HKDollars 55.50.
SHANGHAI A shares ended 8.1 per cent lower after a disappointing dividend
from Shanghai Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone Development, regarded as the
market's most solid blue-chip. The index shed 62.24 to 702.77 in heavy
turnover of Yn2.91bn. Lujiazui was the day's heaviest loser, falling Yn3.60,
or 13.1 per cent, to Yn23.90 in volume of 7.21m shares.
SYDNEY's All Ordinaries index fell 4.2 to 2,017.6 in spite of better than
expected third quarter consumer price data. QBE, the insurance company, rose
9 cents to ADollars 4.72 after it reported a strong rise in first quarter
premiums.
SINGAPORE The Straits Times Industrial index closed down 5.25 points at
2,357.29, with Malaysian OTC stocks and domestic property-related shares
both in gentle retreat. TAIPEI closed lower for the third straight day on
falls in the food sector, the weighted index losing 56.52 at 6,685.87.
COLOMBO stabilised after Tuesday's sharp fall on the assassination of an
opposition leader, the all share index easing a further 3.12 to 1078.15.
KUALA LUMPUR ended mostly lower but institutional buying in the utility,
Telekom Malaysia, helped push the KLSRE composite index up 3.31 to 1,105.54.
Telekom jumped 60 cents to MDollars 20.80.
BANGKOK rebounded to close at the day's high, helped by technical factors
and firmer sentiment in Hong Kong and Japan. The SET index closed 12.49
higher at 1,514.07 in moderate turnover of Bt6.75bn.
WELLINGTON recovered earlier losses to close with the NZSE-40 index 7.69
higher at 2,069.33.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Optimism about EU poll helps Swedish krona
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Swedish krona was the main mover on the foreign exchanges yesterday as
the currency continued to benefit on optimism about a positive vote next
month to join the European Union, writes Philip Gawith.
The krona was also helped by details of a planned fiscal austerity programme
to deal with the country's large budget deficit. The currency rose as high
as SKr4.71, from Tuesday's close of SKr4.728, before giving up some ground
to finish at SKr4.723.
In quiet trading conditions, the dollar moved in a fairly narrow range,
untroubled by the day's data releases. It closed in London at DM1.4953 ,
from DM1.492, and at Y97.035, from Y96.86.
Sterling had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted index closing at
80.5 from 80.7.
The Bank of Portugal trimmed two money market rates, cutting its regular
rate for draining funds to 8.5 per cent, from 8.75 per cent, and its average
repo rate to 8.875 per cent from 9 per cent. The escudo closed unchanged
against the D-Mark at Es102.1.
In Greece the interest rate on 12 month treasury bills fell by 50 basis
points to 19 per cent. The rate on three and six month bills was cut by 150
basis points to 16.5 per cent and 17.5 per cent respectively.
Although the latest opinion polls show sentiment towards the EU to be evenly
balanced in Sweden, markets have priced in a pro-EU vote at the November 13
referendum.
Also supporting the currency is the new government's apparent commitment to
reduce the budget deficit. The most recent development was the call by Mr
Goran Persson, the new social democrat finance minister, for all government
departments to cut spending by 20 per cent.
The government is also committed to cutting SKr150bn off the deficit by
1998, though there is some scepticism about whether lower interest rates and
higher employment provide a plausible basis for expecting the deficit to
fall. The prime minister, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, is also on the record saying
that if the Swedes do not vote yes at the referendum, then even greater
policy cuts will be required.
Other Nordic currencies were also firmer on the back of the krona, with the
Finnish markka touching a high of FM3.025 to the D-Mark.
The Bundesbank council meets today for the first time since the German
elections, amid conflicting views on the policy outlook. Official rates were
last moved on May 11, while the repo rate has been at 4.85 per cent since
July 27.
A Reuters poll found that of 20 economists surveyed, only three of the nine
still forecasting further monetary easing expect this in 1994. On Tuesday
economists at six leading institutes said there should be no more major
reductions in official rates.
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Kidder Peabody in London,
said there was a reasonable prospect of the Bundesbank announcing a further
fixed repo, but trimming the rate by, say, five basis points. She said
month-end volatility made a variable repo unlikely, as this could result in
rates being bid up, confounding the signals the bank may want to send.
But yesterday evening, Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, the Bundesbank deputy
president, fanned speculation about a variable tender. He said: 'One should
not rashly conclude that any switch in the form of the tender means a change
in the line on interest rates.'
The dollar had a steady day, but sentiment remains resolutely negative. Mr
Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank, commented: 'DM1.50 is now
turning out to be a resistance level, rather than a support level.'
Mr George Magnus, international economist at SG Warburg, provided a counsel
of despair, saying: 'The dollar (is) now equally vulnerable to strong and
weak economic data.' He said strong data would fuel fears of higher rates,
adding to concerns that the Fed had tightened policy too little, too late,
while weaker data would reinforce the view that the Fed would delay a
further tightening.
Mr Magnus concluded: 'The dollar will be vulnerable either until confidence
that inflation will be kept under control is restored or until the currency
forces the authorities' hand.'
The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.35bn shortage in UK money markets at
established rates. Overnight money traded between 3 1/2 and 5 per cent, and
three month LIBOR was unchanged at 6 per cent.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (14): Message of the Prophet -
Universities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES

<TEXT>
In 1990 an oil spillage off the Atlantic coast threatened to cause great
damage. King Fahd of Saudia Arabia offered King Hassan of Morocco Dollars
50m to help contain it. In the event, strong winds averted a catastrophe,
writes Francis Ghiles.
However, King Hassan used the money to realise a dream, creating a
university inspired by the Anglo-Saxon education system instead of the
French one, which governs all the other universities in Morocco.
Four years later, a new campus has risen on the outskirts of Ifrane, a
mountain station south of the old imperial city of Fez in Northern Morocco.
The first students out of a total which will rise to 3,500 started to attend
classes in September 1994. They are all post-graduates in three faculties -
business administration, humanities and social sciences, sciences and
engineering.
It is a private university, where all students pay fees. Donations have
enabled scholarships to be offered, as the king does not want the university
to draw its students exclusively from the wealthy Moroccan bourgeoisie.
'Al Khawayn' (the two brothers) is a revolutionary concept for Morocco. It
aims to renew its cultural past and is part of the king's aim of tying the
country to Europe while promoting links between Arab states, Palestinians
and Israel. The campus is built around a mosque, but boasts a synagogue and
a church.
The Moroccans have been advised by the Texas International Education
Consortium, which regrouped the 32 state universities of Texas, on the
curriculum. The degrees will be recognised in the US.
The university has three research centres devoted to Islamic culture and the
arts, natural resources and strategic studies. Researchers, drawn from all
over the world, will form part of the teaching staff.
The 'Al Khawayn' aims to encourage serious debate on Islamic values and how
they relate to the modern world. Its success would show that Islam can
modernise the message of the Prophet and avoid the narrow interpretation of
the Koran promoted by many fundamentalist movements today.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (12): Shortages seem likely to persist / A
look at the problems of the energy sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Power shortages are nothing new in Morocco. Nor, for that matter, are power
cuts. Throughout the 1980s, however, power cuts affected factories and were
all but invisible to the public at large.
In the autumn of 1992 the cuts took a turn for the worse. The National
Electricity Office (ONE), which has a monopoly of electricity generation,
and the municipal distribution companies (Regies) were forced to cut off
customers, often entire industrial zones, and stop television programmes
between 2pm and 6pm. Such cuts hit the country's industrial production and
undermined the arguments put forward by senior officials keen to attract
foreign investment to the kingdom.
The immediate cause of the cuts was a drought. Hydroelectricity usually
accounts for 15 per cent of all electricity in Morocco, but its share two
years ago was cut to 4 per cent.
However, the root causes of the persistent shortages are more deep-seated.
They include a substantial build-up of unpaid bills and debts throughout the
sector; a lack of autonomy from government ministries which discourages
management initiative; a lack of co-ordination among the enterprises within
the sector; the absence of an economically sound approach to tariff
regulation and finally the lack of a clear legal code and regulatory system.
The sheer size of unpaid bills underlines the problem. As of March 1993, ONE
clients were approximately Dollars 500m in arrears. Of that amount the
Regies owed ONE about two-thirds. In turn, the Regies were owed substantial
amounts by their customers, mainly in the public sector.
Though ONE has for 40 years had a monopoly on the production of electricity,
it has never been able to manage existing and potential demand, because of
political interference.
In particular, ONE has had no influence on price setting, tariffs and
distribution. Tariffs do not properly reflect economic costs. This explains,
for instance, why peak demand represents 180 per cent of base demand and
lasts only five hours every day. Low tension electricity is sold more
cheaply than high tension electricity, even though it is more expensive to
produce. Industrial users subsidise domestic ones.
One half of all purchases of electricity are conducted through local Regies,
which are jointly controlled by local authorities and local representatives
of the state. The results are predictable. Funds and appointments have long
been mismanaged. In some areas of Morocco such as Tetuan ONE and local
authorities competed to build power lines and then fought for clients who
could not afford to plug into the available power because the cost of doing
so was set so high by the local authorities. The drought was thus, in the
words of one senior Moroccan official, 'akin to knocking a paralytic to the
ground'.
The panic buying of nine gas turbines at a total cost of Dollars 300m has
enabled ONE to produce an extra 300 megawatts but running costs are three
times those of a coal-fired power station. Gas turbines, designed to run on
diesel for short periods, have been running continuously. So there has been
inadequate time to do daily maintenance or clean the residue of the heavy
diesel fuel from the turbines which have sometimes broken down.
Installing new capacity in a hurry may solve the problem in the short term
but senior officials accept that it will do little to avoid shortages at a
later stage. Demand is growing at about 7 per cent per annum, but it must be
reduced in a systematic way, notably by discouraging it at peak times
through special tariffs, encouraging energy efficiency and building new
capacity. The constraints imposed in recent years on spending have pushed
the government into looking, for the first time, at the idea of private
investment in electricity generation.
There are three keys to a successful policy apart from new men - the
leadership of ONE was changed at a stroke last March.
1 Morocco must allow for a rise in demand for electricity and double its
present generating capacity to around 5,000 megawatts by the year 2000.
2 ONE, which has a heavy public service obligation and is handicapped
compared to potential private investors, must be allowed a freer hand.
3 A clear legal code for regulating the sector and the predictable and sound
caucus of rules governing tariffs must be adopted, which will allow ONE to
address the needs of a modern economy.
There are three ways in which power generation can be increased, all of
which are now being pursued. The first is to sub-contract primary power
generation to private companies. This is being done at Jorf Lasfar, south of
Casablanca, where tenders have gone out for the management of two existing
coal fuelled stations which produce 600 megawatts and the building of two
new ones which will produce an equivalent amount of electricity. Leading
western groups such as ABB, AES-GE, Els, Endesa, National Power and Bechtel
are competing for a contract which over a 10-year period is worth Dollars
1.4bn.
The second source of energy will be the transit fee in gas that Morocco will
collect from the Maghreb Europe Pipeline (GME) which will carry gas from
Algeria to Spain and Portugal. Construction has just begun. Gas from this
pipeline will fuel two combined cycle plants, due to be built in Kenitra and
Mohamedia, which will produce 300 megawatts each.
Electricity interconnections with Algeria, which allow Morocco to purchase
up to 150 megawatts, already exist. By 1996 the planned interconnection with
Spain will enable Morocco to purchase 300 megawatts, a figure which will
rise to 600 by the year 2000.
Recasting the institutional framework is the third challenge Morocco faces.
Political involvement at all levels reduces management autonomy and
effectiveness.
Some examples illustrate the problem. ONE's investment plan is developed and
financed in a way which reflects immediate problems facing the government.
Financial constraints have led to a preference for bilateral aid financing
rather than commercial credits, which in turn leads to delays in realising
projects.
ONE must pay import taxes which amount to 50 per cent of the import value of
fuel; in Tunisia and the Iberian peninsula such taxes amount to 1.5 per cent
or nothing respectively. Individual electricity boards have a social role,
thus connecting customers is sometimes driven by political and social
pressures rather than by the pursuit of commercial gain.
Privatising local boards could well provide an answer. Tariffs must reflect
economic costs, be adjusted to inflation and not penalise industry. Two-part
tariffs for low voltage must be introduced, and more sensitive tariffs for
all customers are a must.
Such changes, some Moroccans argue, are difficult to introduce because of
metering problems. All customers paying a peak tariff would need a new
meter. Also, there is the problem of explaining to customers why there is a
peak tariff.
Changing bulk supply tariffs will be difficult politically if it entails a
change from the previous 'no win no lose' policy. It is, however, fair to
point out that the crisis of 1992 opened people's eyes. Those now in charge
of the sector - Mr Abdellatif Guerraoi at the Ministry of Energy and Mines
and Mr Driss Benhima, the new head of ONE - are able hands-on operators.
They know, as do their colleagues in government, that the number of
households in the countryside which receive electricity must be pushed up
above the current level of 30 per cent and that efforts to promote the
activities of local entrepreneurs and attract foreign investment will come
to little if there is no power to back up such activities.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (13): Consumers must pay more - Water
resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Improving the management of its water resources is one of the key challenges
that Moroccan planners face over the next decade. Morocco, where per capita
renewable water resources are estimated at 833 cubic metres, is currently,
in the jargon of specialists, 'water stressed'. By the year 2020 per capita
water resources are expected to be halved to 411 cubic metres. The country
would then qualify as 'chronically water stressed'.
Drinking water reaches only 14 per cent of the rural population, while
resources in a number of important water basins are being exhausted as the
infrastructure deteriorates. But much has been achieved, in contrast to
neighbouring Algeria.
Perched on the north-west tip of Africa, Morocco is subject to diverse
climatic conditions. The port around Tangier and in the Rif mountain range
is very Mediterranean, the south is quite Saharan and the western coastal
plains are subject to Atlantic influences.
Average annual precipitation levels vary from 750mm in the north to below
100mm in the south. Total rainfall averages 150bn cubic metres a year, 30bn
of which replenish surface and ground water flows, the rest being lost in
evaporation. Uneven geographical distribution of resources is compounded by
uneven and erratic rainfalls. Morocco is susceptible to long periods of
drought.
Half of Morocco's 26m people live on the land, and agriculture provides the
livelihood to 40 per cent of the economically active population,
contributing around 17 per cent of gross domestic product. Excellent
rainfall last winter explains the 11 per cent expected growth in GDP this
year; drought more often than not results in a decline in GDP.
Barely 14 per cent of countryfolk have access to safe and reliable supplies
of water, for which they pay up to 10 times as much as in town.
Contamination of water resources accounts for half of all illnesses in such
areas.
Agriculture is by far the largest user of water, accounting for 85 per cent
of mobilised resources, a figure which is projected to decline to 77 per
cent by the year 2020. Drinking and industrial needs account for the
balance.
The greatest challenge facing the authorities is that of the supply and
demand balances. Shortages are already evident in a number of river basins.
Moroccan water resources are unevenly distributed between basins. Almost 50
per cent of total resources and 93 per cent of current regional surpluses
are concentrated in the Sebou and Oum Er Rabia basins. The Casablanca and
Rabat-Sale metropolitan areas, which account for 25 per cent of all
residential and industrial water demand today, already supplement scarce
local resources with water imported from the Oum Er Rabia basin.
Reallocating water resources from irrigation to higher value urban and
industrial customers without unnecessary hardship to deprived rural
communities is a major issue. Such transfers are inevitable but they need
not penalise farming if the efficiency of water use in agriculture is
increased. To give but one example, a 20 per cent reduction in water
requirements in the Doukkala irrigation perimeter would postpone the need
for alternative resources for the Casablanca region until 2050.
The creation of tradeable water rights in these circumstances may provide a
solution but it leads to some interesting questions. Could Casablanca
contribute to improving efficiency in the Doukkala perimeter in order to be
guaranteed secure water supplies at a cost below such expensive alternatives
as desalination?
Another aspect of the challenge is that, faced with higher water charges,
farmers may be expected to substitute higher value and less water-intensive
crops. However the market opportunities for these crops may be limited, thus
raising doubts as to their viability in some irrigated areas.
A deterioration in the quality of water constitutes another challenge. Water
pollution from domestic, industrial and agricultural sources is approaching
critical levels in the two most important river basins. Drinking water
supplies have been suspended several times in the Sebou basin and quality
problems have occurred in Oum Er Rabia.
The constraints on government spending argue in favour of shifting the costs
burden more rapidly towards customers. Until recently, the state budgets
financed virtually all water investment. Senior Moroccans accept this is no
longer possible.
Urban tariffs today cover operational and maintenance charges for water
supplies and sewage, as well as the financial charges associated with the
treatment, pumping and distribution of water. But they take no account of
marginal costs, most notably the construction of dams. An even greater
imbalance lies in the difference between water tariffs in towns and
irrigation, the latter representing one fifth of the former.
The deterioration of the infrastructure is yet another problem and the
return from existing investment could be significantly raised by improved
maintenance. The silting up of dams is a major concern, having already
diminished available capacity by as much as one quarter. Conveyance losses
in irrigation canals are believed to be as high as 25 per cent. Giving
greater weight to efficiency and pricing criteria can thus be expected to
yield considerable benefits.
Government spending on mobilising and distributing water is projected to
rise by 350 per cent to 2 per cent of GDP by the end of the decade.
Some specialists question whether too many resources are being devoted to
the expansion of large-scale irrigation. Some 80 per cent of the Dollars
4.8bn National Irrigation Plan budget up to the end of the century is
earmarked for such expansion and a further Dollars 1bn to rehabilitating
existing irrigation systems.
World Bank experts who have been actively involved in financing the
development of Morocco's water resources believe that it remains to be
demonstrated that the proposed expansion of irrigated areas will prove
competitive in terms of economic, social and environmental returns on
investment. They believe the balance of investment should be shifted in
favour of rehabilitating existing investments.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (9): Africa's second biggest stock market
 -David White finds that an old-fashioned clubbable place has been
transformed in two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sleepy Casablanca stock market, accustomed to being an old-fashioned,
clubbable place where nothing much went on, has come to life.
New share issues, privatisation, the arrival of foreign investment funds and
radical reform of the bourse's organisation have transformed it in less than
two years.
According to Mr Adil Douiri, co-founder of Casablanca Finance Group (CFG),
an investment bank set up in 1992 and still the only institution of its kind
in Morocco, the Casablanca bourse has now established itself as the chief
stock market on the African continent outside South Africa, with a market
capitalisation of some Dollars 5bn.
The reform, approved in September 1993 and still in the process of being
implemented, is based on the current French system.
Like the French Societe des Bourses Franc,aises, which is providing advice,
it involves converting the market into a limited company in which the
stockbrokers are shareholders.
Among its aims are better company information, more protection for investors
and a broader range of financial instruments. It brings in a new supervisory
body, the obscurely-named Conseil Deontologique des Valeurs Mobilieres.
Up to now, Moroccan businesses have relied on the banking system rather than
the share and bond markets to provide funds. Up to 1991, most of the
activity on the bourse was in government bonds. Since then, however,
equities have taken over and now account for 95 per cent of trading.
Interest picked up last year with a series of share offerings - something
not seen in Casablanca for a long time. The starting point was an offering
of shares in the family-held Wafabank in December 1992.
Foreign interest awakened in the form of US and UK-based portfolio managers
specialising in emerging markets. These funds continue to dominate foreign
investment in the market, with little showing from continental Europe. Their
increasing involvement in the Casablanca market reflects an improved
perception generally of the Moroccan economy, now that the IMF-led
adjustment of the 1980s is completed and the country has resumed repaying
its debts after a series of rescheduling agreements.
In the past 12 months, some Dollars 200m of foreign money has come onto the
market, according to Mr Douiri, about 40 per cent of total volume. He
expects the foreign inflow to reach Dollars 500m next year.
Trading volume increased 362 per cent last year to Dh2.44bn by CFG's
calculation (the figure differs from the turnover total published by the
bourse, which includes the separate figures for purchases and sales). Volume
this year is already well past 1993's full-year total. Market
capitalisation, again using CFG's calculation, showed an increase of 44 per
cent to Dh32.9bn at the end of the year, three times the level of 1990.
(This figure reflects the value of the whole capital of quoted companies,
whereas the bourse uses a smaller figure based on shareholdings placed on
the market.) Prices last year rose by 26 per cent, and had already exceeded
that rate of increase by mid-October this year.
The boost in activity has been greatly helped by share placements made by
the state as part of privatisation deals, starting with the CTM transport
company in June last year and following by the Cior cement concern. Both
were heavily oversubscribed.
In addition, there have been private sector capital increases - notably by
Omnium Nord Africain (ONA), the country's largest company. Its Dh1.5bn issue
of common stock in May this year was the biggest operation ever made on the
bourse by an industrial group. ONA is a wide-ranging conglomerate based
largely on agribusiness but with interests ranging from a television channel
to car sales. The king has an 18 per cent stake. (It is somehow typical of
Morocco that an uninformed outsider could read the whole of the 100-page
prospectus without becoming aware of this.)
Another issue is awaited from General Tire of Morocco, half-controlled by
Germany's Continental group.
More shares will come onto the market in the next few weeks and months as
the government completes its initial list of privatisations. This will
include 16 per cent of the shares of the holding company Societe Nationale
d'Investissement, which was the best-performing stock on the market last
year, with a 171 per cent price increase.
The sell-offs have also played a role in increasing public awareness about
the market through full-page press advertisements, and in bringing in new
investors. Stockbrokers believe the market can absorb all the privatisation
issues as long as Moroccan residents continue to be debarred from investing
in capital markets abroad.
There is also hope that the stock market reforms could lead Moroccan
emigrants - there are some 800,000 in France alone - to channel a large part
of their money transfers into industrial investments instead of into real
estate.
The first significant involvement of Moroccan households as investors, in a
market overwhelmingly dominated up to now by institutions, is expected to
come with the launching of the mutual funds in the next two months. These
will be open to foreign investors but are geared mainly to tapping domestic
savings.
Mr Douiri says mutual funds could bring in Dollars 300m, as a 'conservative'
estimate, in the first year.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (10): Protection by the king - The Jewish
community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
King Hassan's role as a bridge-builder in the Arab-Israel conflict is one
which, for one generation, deeply angered many of his Arab peers and often
puzzled western observers.
Ten years ago the Moroccan Jewish community hosted a conference on
Maimonides, the 12th century Jewish scholar who wrote his famous Guide to
the Perplexed in Arabic. It was the first such Jewish conference in an Arab
country for decades and Jews came from around the world, including Israel.
Some Labour and Likud members of parliament who had been born in the kingdom
attended, and a banquet to welcome the delegates was hosted by Sidi
Mohammed, the Moroccan crown prince.
While re-asserting support for the Palestinian cause, the king reiterated
his country's long-standing policy of protecting its Jewish citizens and
offered to mediate on talks between Israel, Arab nations and the
Palestinians. Syria promptly withdrew its ambassador to Morocco but the
event was a gesture to the Jewish community, a demonstration that Jews and
Arabs could sit down and talk to each other.
In the context of the Arab world the conference undercut hardline Arab
states such as Syria and Algeria and bolstered the moderate camp led by
Egypt, which in 1978 had signed the Camp David agreement, recognising
Israel.
Those familiar with Jewish history in Morocco were less surprised by the
move, though still impressed. Most of Morocco's Jewish community - which has
declined from 300,000 40 years ago to 8,000 today - descend from families
which fled the Spanish inquisition after the Christian reconquest of Granada
in southern Spain in 1492.
They are regarded as 'dhimmi', ie protected persons but first and foremost
as tribute bearers. Christians laboured under the same status at the time in
all Muslim states.
The Koran clearly states that non-Muslims are to be humbled. In the imperial
cities of Morocco this injunction was respected for many centuries. The
sumptuary laws were generally enforced. In addition to distinguishing
garments and restrictions on mounts, Jews had to walk barefoot in some
towns, in others only when passing in front of mosques. They were often
forced to do odious tasks as corvee labourers.
In the 16th century Leo Africanus, the travel writer, bears ample witness to
the contempt in which Jews in the cities were generally held. It would be
wrong, however, to conclude that they suffered more than the Christians and
much more than the rest of the population - most ordinary citizens were
frequent victims of pillage and rapine.
However, as elsewhere in north Africa, there is no obsession with the Jews
comparable to that found in medieval European literature, nor has there ever
been the persecution seen in Europe in modern times. Most traditional
Moroccan stereotypes of Jews may have been negative, but they were also
peripheral.
The mellahs, or Jewish ghettos, were usually built next to royal palaces to
make them easier to protect and the sultans frequently turned to the Jewish
community to help raise funds for projects or to negotiate treaties with
foreign powers. This role as 'tujjar al sultan' was a corollary of the
knowledge of foreign languages that many Jews had and their network of
relations in the wider world. Such links were of particular importance in a
country which for centuries turned its back on the Holy See and forced the
ambassadors of foreign powers to reside in the port of Tangiers, on the
strait of Gibraltar, summoning them to the courts in Fez or Marrakesh only
when their presence was required.
King Mohammed V, father of the present monarch, refused to give the Vichy
authorities a census list of Jews during the second world war. He ensured
that in those difficult years his Jewish subjects did not go unprotected.
After independence, for a brief while the government boasted a Jewish
minister. That is true again today, since the appointment nearly two years
ago of Mr Serge Berdujo, who heads the Jewish community in Morocco, as
minister of tourism.
Other Jews play an important role, none more so that Mr Andre Azoulay, whose
career includes co-founding the newspaper Maroc Information after
independence in 1956 (it was closed by the authorities three years later),
and a long spell in a senior position at Banque Paribas in Paris.
He was the founder of 'Identity and Dialogue', a group of intellectuals
which did much in the 1970s to bring together Jews of Moroccan origin who
had emigrated to France, Canada and Israel, thus initiating better
understanding of the 2,000-year history of the Moroccan Jewish community.
Since 1991 Mr Azoulay has been King Hassan's adviser for economic and
financial affairs. Born in Essaouira, the port town from which the family of
Lord Hore-Belisha, the British politician, originated, Mr Azoulay has acted
as the king's 'sherpa' for the conference which, later this month, will
bring together Mr Itzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister; Mr Yasser
Arafat, head of the Palestinian authority and hundreds of western and Arab
businessmen.
From 'tujjar al sultan' to 'sherpa', the connection is quite obvious, as
trade links are publicly established between Israel and Morocco instead of
the discreet bonds that have existed for many years.
The extraordinary diversity of Jewish life that existed in Morocco for
centuries, with Jewish communities differing among themselves even more than
the Muslims, may never return. The spectrum ranged from the citizens of a
coastal town who benefited from the protection of a foreign power to
Berber-speaking Jewish cobblers settled in the midst of a dissident Berber
tribe, from the prestigious descendants of refugees from Spain to
inhabitants of mellahs in remote towns of the Berber heartland of Morocco in
which chieftancies were elective.
Important Israeli businessmen, such as Mr Amiran Sivan, president of Bank
Hapoalim; Mr Eytan Chichinski, president of Koor, Israeli's leading
industrial group; Mr Michael Freedman, president of the Dan hotel chain and
Mr Itzhak Lendsmann, president of Tnuva, one of Israel's largest dairy
producers, have started to pay visits to Morocco to discuss trade and
investment opportunities. Mr Raphael Edery, the vice-president of the
Knesset and Labour MP, is another recently visitor.
The Omnium Nord Africain, Morocco's largest private group which is run by Mr
Fouad Filali, the king's son-in-law and son of the prime minister, has set
up Salam 2000 with the Spanish Banesto Bank, Koor and the Palestinian
national fund. The group has a capital of USDollars 60m and aims to invest
in the Palestinian homeland.
Israeli irrigation specialists are already working in southern Morocco and
10,000 Israelis of Moroccan origin visit the kingdom every year. Direct air
links are expected to follow soon.
Whatever the future holds, the 10 years since Mr Rabin came secretly to
Morocco to visit the king and the conference now being held in Casablanca
have added an extraordinary dimension to nearly 2,000 years of relations
between Jews and the Moroccan people.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (11): Gatt deal could hit exports -
Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Gatt agreement signed last April in the southern Moroccan city of
Marrakesh could, paradoxically, cost the kingdom as much as Dollars 700m in
lost exports.
Exports of farm products, notably citrus, tomatoes, potatoes and cut flowers
would be hit. A confidential report drafted last January by the Moroccan
ministry of agriculture puts export losses in the farm sector at Dh500m, a
figure which was confirmed a month ago by a paper on 'the Uruguay Round and
its effects on North Africa', presented at the annual conference of the
French Association of Economic Science in Paris.
The reason for this state of affairs can be traced to the strategy adopted
by Morocco in the run-up to the Gatt agreement. The kingdom's farm produce
has, since the first agreement signed with the European Union in 1967,
enjoyed preferential access to European markets. Lower European import
duties are charged on a range of produce exported by Morocco than on similar
produce imported from countries which have not signed a partnership
agreement with the EU.
Preferential access was confirmed in the 1980s and was seen as a form of
compensation for the trade diversion which Morocco was bound to suffer
because of the access of Spain and Portugal to the EU in 1986. Spain's
accession, in particular, gave such produce as citrus and tomatoes from the
Iberian Peninsula much easier access to the markets of northern Europe. The
EU granted Morocco quotas to help it overcome this.
The new Gatt agreement, by changing the pattern of European protection,
technically forced the EU and Morocco to renegotiate their previous
agreement. Morocco's strategy during the Uruguay Round was to avoid
including multilateral concessions on Mediterranean fruit and vegetables in
the broader discussion in order to prevent the preferential access its
products enjoyed in the European Union being granted to all parties. This
would have encouraged new competitors to try their hands in EU markets.
There was always a risk, however, that Morocco's strategy would backfire if
only because of the reluctance of the European Union to include
Mediterranean produce in the free trade agreement which it was then in the
process of negotiating with the kingdom.
The Commission was under heavy pressure from Spanish, Dutch and Belgian
exporters of tomatoes, cut flowers and citrus fruit to use the Gatt
negotiation as a means of curtailing Moroccan access to EU markets, to the
detriment, in Moroccan eyes, of European consumers. Indeed, such Moroccan
produce is of higher quality and somewhat cheaper than its Dutch, Belgian
and Spanish equivalents. Reducing Morocco's capacity to export and earn
foreign income also rebounds on those European companies which export to the
kingdom. Morocco simply has fewer means to pay for new machinery and other
goods, most of which it buys in Europe.
The dilemma that Moroccan policy planners face today is all the more acute
because the country's farming sector is at a crossroads. The uncertainty
created by recent events could have serious consequences, in particular that
of holding back investment both by Moroccan nationals and by the many
European companies which have set up joint ventures in the farming sectors
in recent years.
A steady flow of investment, whose aim is to improve both the quantity and
quality of what is produced, transported and marketed, is crucial if Morocco
wishes to maintain the competitive edge many of its producers have gained in
recent years.
These producers are mindful of repeating the mistake they made a decade ago
when they did little to improve quality in the citrus sector while Moroccan
exports were rising at a comfortable 5 per cent a year. Their complacency
was rudely shaken when they realised, too late, that ahead of joining the
European Union, Spanish producers had massively extended fruit groves,
replanted many trees and, in the process, virtually doubled their country's
production capacity.
Moroccan exports of citrus, potatoes, tomatoes and cut flowers have been
buoyant in recent years. Exports of tomatoes increased from 80,000 to
138,000 tonnes in the five years to 1993 and those of cut flowers from
1,1000 to 3,000 tonnes between 1988-89 and 1992-93. Overall, this sector
employs an estimated 300,000 people and 1.5m Moroccans depend on it for
their livelihoods.
The potential adjustment costs if no agreement is brokered between Morocco
and the EU would be considerable, quite apart from lost exports. Writing
down capital would be expensive and technical know-how would be lost. The
social consequences in a country with severe unemployment would be heavy.
A recent World Bank report on 'agro-industrial development - constraints and
opportunities' estimates this sector's contribution to GDP at 5 per cent,
its contribution to industrial GDP at 25-30 per cent and to exports at 16-20
per cent. The value added of such exports has grown at 8-14 per cent
annually in recent years. 'The estimates are likely to understate the
contribution of agro-processing,' the report notes.
The options for Morocco are twofold. Either the EU can find a way of
maintaining some of the preferential treatment it has afforded to such
imports or the Moroccans will have to make, in the words of one expert, 'a
huge reconversion towards processed products which, though they enjoy less
value-added than fresh fruit and vegetable exports, are less politically
sensitive in the European Union.'
More broadly, were Morocco to aim for self-sufficiency in cereals, edible
oils and sugar, where domestic production respectively meets 40-70, 30-35
and 70 per cent of domestic needs today, such a policy would come at a very
high cost to consumers and the country's natural resource base, notably
water. Indeed, periodic drought puts a premium on the use of water, which,
according to the World Bank, is today only charged Dh1 a cubic metre, a
price which represents 16 per cent of recovery costs.
To date, the European Union has used its financial muscle essentially to
extend aid to Morocco rather than to allow free trade. This 'aid rather than
trade' policy, which is part of the logic of the Common Agricultural Policy,
has the perverse effect of doing little to ensure long-term stability in a
key southern partner of Europe.
No-one in Morocco disputes that the kingdom itself must put its house in
order. The same World Bank report points out that 'despite significant
efforts by several government agencies to ensure quality, these efforts are
unco-ordinated and, at times, incoherent.' Credit to agriculture is another
constraint. Short-term loans are available.
However, the report says, 'scarce long-term finance is rationed among
enterprises via high collateral requirements and loan guarantees. This
policy militates against newer and less-established enterprises. Even for
those with access to formal credit, they have to finance long-term
investment with short-term loans, which increases their financial
vulnerability.' The banks, as in other sectors of the economy, seldom seem
to act as promoters of economic activity.
In the past decade, Morocco has switched from an inward-oriented and
regulated approach of its economy to an outward-looking policy which relies
on market mechanisms. New technology, marketing structures and consumer
preferences worldwide, however, are forcing the pace of change.
Morocco's food processing industry is still in its infancy. The full
integration of Spain and Portugal into the European Union the year after
next will inevitably erode some of the preferential treatment its farm
exports have enjoyed.
As farming and food processing provide the livelihood of half the kingdom's
26m people, its well-being is a key to future social and political
stability. In the eyes of Moroccans who have a stake in these matters, the
sooner the uncertainty in its relations with the European Union ends, the
better.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (7): Denim maker shows way ahead - The
government's aim is to establish integrated industrial sectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a gentle rise overlooking the plain at Settat, south of Casablanca,
stands an impeccable new factory producing half the denim needed by
Morocco's clothing industry.
The Spanish company Tavex, a leading European producer of denim cloth, built
the Dollars 50m facility two years ago. The Moroccan branch now accounts for
a third of the group's production. By 1996, under current plans, this
proportion will have built up to almost half.
With 260 employees, the venture does some direct export business - it has a
contract with Wrangler of the US - but is essentially geared to the needs of
the local clothing industry, which accounts for one in every four
manufacturing jobs in Morocco and depends overwhelmingly on exports of
finished products to the European market.
For Mr Driss Jettou, the industry minister, who himself is a businessmen
with textile interests, the venture illustrates one way in which Morocco can
reduce its vulnerability in a highly cost-competitive industry.
'Before, we made jeans, importing the cloth. Now we make the material.' The
factory, carrying out the whole process of spinning, dyeing, weaving and
finishing, is an example of the government's aim of establishing
increasingly integrated industrial sectors.
Textiles and clothing, Morocco's biggest industrial sector in value after
food and chemicals, is already suffering from competition from south-east
Asia and other areas. Morocco currently has a significant advantage in wage
costs compared to EU countries - a ratio of as much as one to five - but Mr
Jettou says the government is conscious of the risk of counting too much on
this differential.
'We want to avoid surprises,' he says. 'Basing our industrial development on
a low price of labour cannot last long. Someone will always come up who can
do it more cheaply.'
His department is placing emphasis on training at all levels, quality and
productivity, on integrating industrial activities, attracting
higher-technology industries (with companies such as Alcatel and Thomson
already installed) and exploiting Morocco's proximity to the European market
to ensure quick reaction and delivery times which Asian producers would find
difficult to match.
Morocco's manufacturing sector accounts for about 18.5 per cent of gross
domestic product, a proportion that has increased only gradually in recent
years. The government has promised more support for the private industrial
sector and a reduction in administrative red tape. It is counting on a boost
from foreign investment and privatisation of state activities, ranging from
machine tools to canneries.
Mr Abdellatif Filali, the liberal-minded prime minister, said soon after his
appointment this summer that the government must 'let the private sector
play its role,' recognising that the state 'does not have the vision of a
modern entrepreneur'.
Many employers are nervous, however. Mr Abderrahmane Ouali,
secretary-general of the CGEM business federation based in Casablanca, is
worried that many Moroccan companies are too small to take on world
competition under the conditions of April's Gatt agreement. Three out of
four Moroccan manufacturers have fewer than 50 employees.
Mr Ouali says he is counting on the establishment of a sectorial
restructuring fund backed by the World Bank, and the availability of more
funds for expansion as savings move from property into shares. Family groups
are likely to open up increasingly to new shareholders, he says.
The predominance of small companies has its advantages, according to Mr
Jettou, insofar as they can adapt rapidly to changing conditions. 'But that
does not mean we are not seeking the development of companies of European or
international dimensions.' This implies encouraging companies to regroup.
Industrial investment from abroad has risen sharply this year, Mr Jettou
says, reaching some Dollars 200m by the end of August, led by France, Spain
and Italy. Overall foreign investment in Morocco totalled Dollars 600m last
year, compared with less than Dollars 100m five years ago, and senior
government planners say a target of Dollars 1bn a year by the year 2000 is
'not dreaming'.
France, which has kept its place as main investor as well as the main
provider of bilateral aid, has tripled its level of investments since 1988.
Investments from Spain have multiplied 20-fold in the same period, and are
now not far behind those of France.
Among the latest ventures, Indo, a Spanish spectacle and lens maker, is
setting up two new plants in the Tangier industrial zone, employing about
100 people.
The government has meanwhile reached agreement with Fiat of Italy on
production of a 'people's car' in Morocco. In a depressed new car market -
distorted by the popularity of second-hand imports - the idea is to produce
a car within the reach of the middle-ranking office worker, and at the same
time boost the components and spares sector. According to Mr Jettou, it
should cost about Dollars 6,500 compared with a minimum of about Dollars
10,000 for cars currently assembled in Morocco.
The Italian group, already present through the Somaca assembly facility in
Casablanca, won the deal against Renault, Peugeot and Citroen, which all
currently have cars assembled in Morocco. The project will start next year
with the existing Uno model but a new model is planned from 1996. Under the
agreement, half the components will be locally made.
But Mr Jettou has no chauvinistic illusions. 'It will be an Italian car,' he
says.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (8): A fishing line to Europe - The
industry provides 15% of the country's exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fish accounts for 15 per cent of all Moroccan exports and the industry
employs at least 150,000 people. The fishing agreement between Morocco and
the European Union is a key part of the kingdom's relations with its
northern neighbours, most notably Spain.
Earlier this month the four-year agreement with the EU, which was due to run
until 1996, was renegotiated. It will now end in May 1995, to be replaced by
an agreement which will run for three years.
For all practicable purposes, it is an agreement with Spain and, to a lesser
extent, with Portugal. Indeed, 95 per cent of the 750 foreign fishing
vessels which are allowed in Moroccan waters are Spanish. Although those
rights to fish have not changed since the first agreement with the EU, after
Spain's accession to the EU in 1998, the idea of biological rest, introduced
in the 1992 agreement, has reduced the amount of the catch by 20 per cent.
The European Union pays Ecu102m for the right of European vessels to fish in
Moroccan waters. To this figure should be added licence fees paid by
individual shipowners that are worth Ecu10m-15m every year to the Moroccan
exchequer. In exchange, the EU grants Morocco preferential access to its
markets. Import duties on Moroccan fish are to decline from 8 per cent in
1993 to 5 per cent in 1996, compared with normal EU duties on foreign fish
of 25 per cent.
However, the new Gatt rules will erode such preferential access as they cut
import duties overall over a period to 12 1/2 per cent, a situation about
which the Moroccans are not happy.
This month's agreement with the EU entails scientific co-operation and
allows Moroccan inspectors on foreign vessels. There are to be talks on cuts
in the amounts that Morocco will allow European vessels to fish after May
1995 and more co-operation to control and preserve fish stocks.
While the Spanish ships respect the two-month biological rest agreed in
1992, the Moroccans appear not to do so. They argue that any curb on
fishing, notably by smaller boats, affects the income of fishermen,
particularly in the north (people who work on small boats are usually paid
in kind) and the absence of fish, albeit temporarily, pushes up the price of
other foods in the markets.
Shrimps and hake are found in the north, but a variety of fish is taken from
Moroccan waters. Moroccan vessels tend to fish near the coast, Spanish
vessels further out at sea. How much is fished illegally by foreign vessels
or sold by Moroccan ships to foreigners on the high seas is impossible to
tell. Some observers believe its value runs to Dollars 100m.
An estimated 550 foreign boats, mostly small fishing vessels from Andalucia,
fish off Morocco's north and north-western shores but by far the most
valuable catch is squid, caught further south. An estimated 150 Spanish
vessels based in Las Palmas fish off Morocco's Saharan shores.
The fact that Morocco's administration of the Western Sahara is recognised
by the EU but not its sovereignty over the former Spanish colony has never
been an obstacle. In its agreement with the EU, the southern Moroccan
fishing zone is deemed to start between Tan Tan and Sidi Ifni which have
always been Moroccan and to extend to Mauritania, thus neatly side-stepping
the question of sovereignty.
Squid is also important for the Moroccan fishing fleet which boasts 450 high
sea vessels, 300 of which are in activity, and 2,500 smaller coastal boats.
The larger vessels fish an estimated 150,000 tons a year, 80 per cent of
which is squid worth an estimated Dh2.7bn; the smaller boats take 450,000
tons, worth about Dh1.3bn.
Of the 600,000 tons of fish and squid drawn from the sea every year by
Moroccan boats, one quarter is exported, bringing in an estimated Dh4bn; one
fifth, mostly sardines of which Morocco is the largest world exporter, is
canned and sold abroad, one quarter is consumed locally and the remainder -
mostly fish of mediocre quality or not kept in good condition because small
fishing boats lack basic equipment, notably refrigeration - is turned into
byproducts.
A big effort is under way in Morocco to modernise the fishing fleet and
improve equipment at the main ports: Safi, Agadir, Tan Tan and Larache.
Morocco's fishing grounds are exceptionally rich. The potential catch off
the country's shores is 1m to 1.5m tons a year, it is estimated.
In 1962 Morocco extended its territorial waters and since 1981 it has
claimed an exclusive fishing zone. However, today the industry is in crisis.
The infrastructure of the ports has not been completed by the stated time,
thus forcing fleet owners to invest instead of the state; the buying of
boats has at times been rather speculative rather than rational and credits
are becoming harder to extract from Moroccan banks. Spare parts are
expensive.
Another factor which has affected the profitability of fishing in the area
is that the price of squid - dictated by its largest market, Japan - has
declined in recent years. Costs will also rise because Morocco will have to
conform to European quality standards which come into force next January.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (6): King's conciliation efforts pay off -
David White assesses foreign policy ahead of next week's important
conference in Casablanca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The choice of Casablanca for next week's conference of political and
business leaders to discuss economic development following the
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement is an acknowledgement of Morocco's role
in trying to promote reconciliation between Jew and Arab.
It has played this role, mostly discreetly, over 20 years or more. Its
efforts stem from the strong personal convictions of King Hassan II, whose
conciliatory gestures in the past have provoked indignation among more
hardline Arab nations, and are rooted in the country's own history of
tolerance. Not only has Morocco always had a Jewish community, with Jews now
in some influential positions: almost a tenth of Israel's population, some
600,000 people, are of Moroccan Jewish descent.
Initially, the scope of the conference was to have been limited to the
Middle East, but Morocco insisted it should be extended to cover North
Africa as well. Morocco has taken a forward position in its relations with
Israel. Its agreement to exchange liaison officers in Rabat and Tel Aviv, a
first step towards full relations, made it only the second country after
Egypt to establish formal ties with Israel.
Senior Moroccan advisers warn against the risk of excessive expectations
from the conference, whose participants will include heads of multinational
corporations. 'But it is essential to send an electric jolt to political and
private sector decision-makers,' they say. 'Across the whole region, from
Morocco to the Gulf, it will not be the same as it was before.'
The host nation is willing to support in principle the idea
of a new development institution on the lines of the European Bank for
Recons- truction and Development, as proposed by Israel, but only if it is
demonstrated that if can play an effective and more than symbolic role, say
Moroccan officials.
The conference will look at prospects for region-wide projects, less
ambitious international ventures involving groups of nations, and national
projects requiring aid. Morocco will bring specific proposals including
possible involvement by Moroccan companies in building a Tel Aviv-Amman
motorway, hotels in Jericho and agricultural projects in the Nile valley. It
will also be seeking assistance for infrastructure plans of its own.
The idea of a vast new frontier-free zone, Moroccan officials warn, 'will
not come about overnight'. The precedent of the Arab Maghreb Union, set up
amid much fanfare in 1989 between Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and
Mauritania, is hardly encouraging. The pact came at a high point in
relations between Morocco and Algeria, officially re-established the
previous year.
The one significant project that can be said to have come from this
co-operation is the Dollars 1.4m gas pipeline - on which work was officially
inaugurated earlier this month - running from Algeria's Sahara gas field of
Hassi R'Mel some 1,100 kilometres through Algeria, Morocco and under the
Strait of Gibraltar before reaching the Spanish and Portuguese, and probably
at a later stage, French markets.
The Arab Maghreb Union was already considered moribund before Morocco and
Algeria locked horns again in the aftermath of a shooting incident in
August, in which two Spanish tourists were killed by gunmen in a Marrakesh
hotel. Morocco, possibly rashly in retrospect, immediately imposed visa
requirements on Algerian citizens or people of Algerian origin. Algeria
reacted, not by reciprocating with visa rules, but by closing the border
completely, something which some believe it wanted to do anyway to try to
stop gun-running.
After initially suspecting Algerian fundamentalist groups of the hotel
killings, Moroccan officials now point the finger at the Algerian
authorities themselves. They believe Algiers may have wanted to demonstrate
that Morocco was not immune to the threat of Islamic extremism and to put a
stop to alleged passive assistance to Algerian fundamentalists.
One of the basic precepts of the UMA treaty was freedom of passage. 'When
the country in the presidency of the UMA closes its border I do not see how
you have a zone of open frontiers,' a Rabat government official commented
wryly. 'The border is easy to close, but difficult to open. Up to 1988 it
stayed closed for 12 years.'
Relations between the two countries have been strained for most of the time,
ever since Algeria won independence from France in 1962. The tension started
with border disputes and built up after 1975 when Spain decided to pull out
of its Western Sahara territory, with the intention of ceding it to Morocco
and Mauritania (the latter subsequently dropping its claim).
Algeria's objection to what it saw as Moroccan expansionism, and its support
for the Polisario Front movement fighting for independence in the territory,
kept a wedge between the two nations. Morocco walked out of the Organisation
of African Unity 10 years ago over its stance on the Sahara.
More than three years after the formal ceasefire with the Polisario, a
UN-sponsored referendum deciding between independence or attachment to
Morocco is supposed to take place next February. But after many delays
already, the date is expected to slip again because of difficulties in
drawing up the electoral register in the region, which covers an area more
than half as big as the internationally recognised territory of Morocco.
However, there is every indication that King Hassan wants to tie up the
Sahara issue rapidly. The general assumption now is that the referendum,
when it takes place, is likely to go in Morocco's favour - and that, in any
case, Morocco would not let it go ahead unless it was pretty sure it would
win. That would put an end to a 20-year quarrel during which the Moroccans,
not adept at handling their own propaganda, incurred widespread discredit.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (5): State to ease telecom links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European and US telecommunications operators are getting set for the contest
to break into Morocco, now planning to liberalise the sector to bring it
into line with the standards of EU countries, writes David White.
With a Dollars 2bn investment programme already under way up to 1997, the
government plans to privatise the state telecommunications authority and
bring in competition for the first time. But it has not yet decided when or
how far liberalisation will go, with some evident differences of view on the
issue among members of the government.
Telephone services have expanded rapidly but there remains a large potential
for expansion and new services to be exploited.
'We are seriously thinking about how to regulate telecoms,' says a senior
government official. Services are currently the monopoly of the 100 per cent
state-owned Office National des Postes et Telecommunications (ONPT). Plans
are being drawn up for turning the state authority into a company that can
then be privatised, and at same time foster competition at least in certain
services such as mobile telephones.
There are now just 1m telephone subscribers in a country with an active
population of 10m. But the network has been growing rapidly, doubling in the
last four years. As recently as 1986, Morocco had only a quarter of a
million telephone lines and fewer than 500 public telephone booths. By last
year the latter had multiplied ninefold. Being of recent vintage, it is an
all-digital system.
Installation of automatic services in rural areas has been stepped up, along
with the introduction of a public data transmission network and two mobile
radio telephone networks. Morocco beat Spain, for instance, in introducing a
cellular mobile service to the international GSM standard.
The ONPT has so far self-financed 45-50 per cent of investments, with the
rest from loans including support from the World Bank and European
Investment Bank. 'The authorities realise that without reliable
telecommunications the country cannot achieve integration in the world
economy,' says Mr Abdeslam Ahizoune, posts and telecommunications minister.
In the next four years the ministry plans to double the telephone network to
2m lines, introduce fibre-optic cables, and follow technology developments
closely in order to 'give companies the same facilities as their competitors
in Europe'.
After studying other countries' experience in liberalising the sector, Mr
Ahizoune says mobile telephones and certain other services will be opened to
competition while shares in the state authority will be sold off.
But it is not yet clear what role the government will keep. Parliamentary
approval is still needed for the conversion of ONPT. Privatisation could
involve a strategic alliance with a foreign company, coupled with a public
share offering. Mr Ahizoune says 'various models' are being considered and
that the changes will be made 'as quickly as possible'.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (2): There's a grinding of teeth in Rabat
/ A look at relations with the European Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lack of progress in negotiations for a new and closer relationship with
the European Union has become Morocco's greatest frustration. There is an
almost audible grinding of teeth in the government offices of Rabat when the
subject is brought up.
Isolated for long periods of its history, Morocco's economic and social
aspirations are firmly fixed on the north, across the 14 kilometres that
separate the country from continental Europe.
Most of its merchandise trade is already done with the European Union, which
accounted last year for 55 per cent of Morocco's imports and 63 per cent of
its exports, with the balance heavily in Europe's favour. In some farm
products, as much as 90 per cent of Moroccan exports are dependent on the
European market. But for Moroccans, relations with the EU are not just a
commercial affair, but also a strong political and emotional issue.
Negotiations have stalled on a new 'association' or 'partnership' agreement
(the title being among the more minor of the questions to be settled).
Morocco has had a series of commercial and co-operation agreements with the
European community over the past 25 years. In 1987, the year after Spain and
Portugal became members, it lodged an application to join, in what officials
now describe as 'a political signal'. The application was turned down, with
the community clearly unwilling to extend the geographical definition of the
EU to the other shore of the Mediterranean.
In 1992 Morocco launched a fresh initiative, seeking exploratory talks on a
new kind of agreement. Talks on detailed proposals began late last year. But
Morocco was bitterly disappointed in its expectations. In Brussels, the
Moroccans are criticised for a naive approach to complex EU procedures and
for failing to mount an effective lobbying campaign.
'We do not understand this slowness,' complains a government minister in
Rabat. Morocco was to have set the model for other countries in their
relations with the EU, but it has been overtaken by both Tunisia and Israel,
and Egypt is now catching up.
The frustration steams largely from the priority that the EU has given to
the countries of eastern and central Europe which are preparing for future
accession. The last enlargement, taking in Spain and Portugal, came as a big
blow to Moroccan agriculture. Now the attention paid to central Europe has
squeezed financial flows to Mediterranean partners. According to EU
officials, per capita grants to central Europe are four times those to
Morocco.
The officials concede, however, that there are strong economic and social
parallels between the two regions and the problems that arise on the EU's
periphery. 'What you see on the Strait of Gibraltar and on the German-Polish
border is strikingly similar: you have illegal trade, illegal migrants and
drug traffic.'
The future of the talks with the EU has now become linked to settlement of a
fishing dispute. Morocco recently set out to halve a previously-agreed level
of catches from its waters, claiming they had been overfished. Fishing is
essentially a bilateral issue between Morocco and Spain, the country in the
front line of Morocco's dealings with Europe. The relationship between the
two is dynamic - especially in trade and investment - but also troublesome.
The latest round of Euro-argument coincided with fresh stirrings by the
Moroccan authorities over the Spanish enclaves on Morocco's northern shore,
Ceuta and Melilla. Morocco is upset by Madrid's unwillingness to set up
talks on the future of the territories, which have been in Spanish hands for
more than 400 years, and especially by plans to give the two enclaves new
statutes conferring a limited degree of self-rule.
Agricultural problems also have to do primarily with competition with Spain.
Morocco's difficulties have increased as a result of the Gatt agreement
signed in Marrakesh in April. Moroccan producers of tomatoes, for instance,
had invested heavily to supply the European market before minimum reference
prices come into force in the spring. But under Gatt terms, the price
mechanisms may be applied year-round, mainly to the benefit of the
Moroccans' Spanish competitors.
The issue is a vital one for Morocco, where 500,000 people are employed in
the farm export sector, with up to 3m dependent on it for their livelihood.
Moroccan negotiators now have the task of trying to reconcile the Gatt
conditions with the country's present agreement with the EU.
Instead of improved access, say officials in Rabat, Morocco now has to fight
to safeguard what it already has.
If the two issues of fishing and sensitive farm exports are resolved, the
officials say, 'we can go ahead on a partnership, but it will fall far short
of what we thought in 1992.' Ministers have spoken of a 'crisis of
confidence' between Rabat and Brussels.
However, it is foreseeable that under a revised negotiating mandate the EU
may give ground on some of Morocco's requests, possibly including in the
proposed agreement a provision for balance-of-payments support.
Moroccan officials see both France and Spain as 'objective political allies'
aware of the strategic and economic importance of developments in North
Africa for the EU itself. 'But we find them in our way when it comes to
sectorial or regional interests.'
According to a EU official, 'our current difficulty with Morocco is that
because of the economic recession in Europe we are pressed to take into
account our short-term interests, which are often in contradiction with our
long-term political and economic interests.'
Last week the European Commission called on the EU to create a
Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area with its North African and Middle East
neighbours, thus establishing the world's biggest free trade area.
As Mr Abdellatif Filali, the prime minister and foreign minister, said at a
recent journalists' lunch: 'The Mediterranean is a lake. Morocco is not the
other end of the world.'

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (4): The big sales are just beginning -
Privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Abderrahman Saaidi, Morocco's privatisation minister, insists: 'We are
not selling the furniture.' But the country's plans for selling state
holdings are unparalleled in their size and scope anywhere in Africa or the
Middle East.
A law allowing the sale of state interests in certain specified sectors was
first passed in 1989. The earlier policy of Moroccanisation, abandoned in
the late 1980s, was being thrown into reverse. But the programme began
cautiously, circumscribed by evident political reservations. Activities such
as the phosphate industry, public utilities, oil refining and the national
flag-carrier Royal Air Maroc were at that stage clearly excluded.
Privatisation did not get under way until 1993 with the sale of the
government's stake in a yeast producer to French and Moroccan interests. The
first major operation was the takeover of majority control of the biggest
cement company, Cior, by Holderbank of Switzerland.
To date, state shareholdings in 24 enterprises have been sold, bringing in
revenues of some Dh3.5bn. By the end of next year, the whole of the initial
list of 112 privatisable interests - 37 hotels and 75 companies - is due to
have been transferred to the private sector, with proceeds expected to reach
Dh17bn, or almost Dollars 2bn.
These are out of a total of some 800 state companies, in part dating from
French policies during the protectorate of 1912-1956, and accounting for
about a fifth of the country's gross domestic product.
A variety of formulas has been devised for the new balance of ownership,
between foreign companies, Moroccan-based interests, employees and the stock
market. In the sale of the CTM-LN bus company, a slice was reserved for
Moroccans living abroad.
In the distribution of petroleum products, the state has already sold all
its holdings, with Shell and Mobil buying back the government's 50 per cent
stake.
have been counted as successes, with stock market offerings heavily
oversubscribed. The government is expected to have little difficulty with
the remainder of its list, except perhaps in finding buyers for textile
factories which have recently been starved of orders.
Eleven state holdings are currently on the market. Mr Saaidi, who recently
went to London, Birmingham and Glasgow to present his plans and glean the
benefits of the UK's experience in privatisation, says the big sales are
just beginning.
The biggest is the state's majority stake in Societe Nationale
d'Investissement, a conglomerate which was used as a vehicle for
Moroccanisation in the 1970s and which embraces 41 companies ranging from
beer to banking and from consumer credit to chemicals. Mr Saaidi, a tax
accountant by profession, says it would have taken too long to sell each
interest individually.
The government will place a further 16 per cent of the group on the stock
market, where it is already traded, and is offering the remainder of its 67
per cent holding to a consortium, setting a floor price for the 51 per cent
stake of Dh1.275bn (Dollars 143m).
The buyers will be committed to putting part of that stake on the market
within three years, with the idea that they will have this time to make
alliances to establish majority control. The intended result of this complex
set of conditions is that between 43 and 48 per cent of the shares will be
traded on the Casablanca stock ex- change, with the current private sector
partners holding 17 per cent and new partners 35 to 40 per cent.
The new core shareholders must be companies domiciled in Morocco and must
hold 35 per cent of the group for at least five years. Within that period,
they will be allowed to restructure holdings, but not sell more than 15 per
cent of book value of the portfolio each year, and must then reinvest at
least 80 per cent of the proceeds in other non-real estate holdings.
Also being sold, as one lot, are majority stakes in three sugar companies.
Sugar producers' co-operatives are given the first option but may be unable
to muster the funds. Still to be sold in the net few months are stakes of 35
to 99 per cent in Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur, the Sonasid steel
products company, newspaper distributor Sochepresse, gas storage company
Somas, and Simef, a maker of diesel and electric motors.
Meanwhile, a more ambitious phase is in preparation, opening up areas that
were specifically ruled as being out-of-bounds in the initial plans,
including public utilities with multi-billion-dollar investment needs which
Morocco is in no position to cover without increasing its debt burden.
Technocratic ministers such as Mr Saaidi argue that there are no longer any
taboos about what can or cannot be sold. 'We have no complexes any more,' he
says. 'Political and public opinion is ready to accept a widening of the
scope of privatisation.'
These plans include privatising the state telecommunications authority,
which has a four-year Dollars 2bn programme to finance, and introducing
competition in mobile telephone services.
The state will also subcontract part of its electricity generating needs,
almost certainly to foreign interests, with financing requirements in the
industry estimated at some Dollars 3bn between public and private sectors.
The new entrant will be required to manage two sites and build two more,
selling the electricity to the state company which will remain the monopoly
distributor. 'That does not mean it cannot change in the future,' says Mr
Saaidi.
Water supply is also a candidate for privatisation, although probably not
until later on. And Royal Air Maroc is no longer considered off-limits.
What is expected to remain firmly in state hands is the mining of phosphates
through the Office Cherifien des Phosphates, as a strategic export sector.
But plans are under discussion for hiving off production of phosphate
derivatives to private concerns.
At the same time, the government is exploring other options for bringing in
private sector management through contractors and concessions. The message
about entrepreneurship has sunk in deep. Even the running of the baths at
the sumptuous new Hassan II mosque in Casablanca is being put out to
contract.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (1): The light shines more brightly -
David White and Francis Ghiles assess the country's economic performance and
its prospects for political change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is probably fair to say that Morocco has never been seen by the world in
general in a more favourable light in all its long and proud history than
now.
Contrast helps, of course. Compared with the brutal civil violence and
near-anarchy of neighbouring Algeria, Morocco stands out for its stability,
cohesion, economic growth and relative liberalism.
This was not always so. Twenty years ago, the longevity of its monarchical
system was open to doubt after two attempts on King Hassan II's life. Ten
years ago, it was in deep financial trouble, leaning on the International
Monetary Fund to steer it through a gradual adjustment process.
The king, 33 years on the throne, has proved a shrewd if stern helmsman  -
and also a statesman, through the role he has played over the years, mostly
behind the scenes, in promoting Arab-Israeli conciliation. It is an implicit
recognition of this role that the international conference on economic
development following the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreements is being
staged in Casablanca, starting this Sunday.
As for the economy, annual growth has averaged 4 per cent over the past
decade. This year, with abundant rain producing a bumper cereal crop, growth
is expected to reach 10 or 11 per cent, after stagnating in 1993 in the
second successive year of drought. Inflation is holding at around 5 per
cent.
Morocco has come through its debt restructuring, and although debt servicing
takes up 30 per cent of the annual budget, the public sector deficit has
fallen from 12 per cent of gross domestic product in the early 1980s to 2
per cent last year. This year the figure is expected to rise slightly to 2.5
per cent.
Starting last year, Morocco embarked on privatisation of a scope comparable
only with that of some Latin American countries. Reservations about losing
the state's grip on public utilities and strategic sectors are progressively
being overcome. The long-dormant stock market in Casablanca can today claim
to be the biggest, in terms of capitalisation, in the African continent
outside South Africa. Foreign investment is expected to reach a record level
this year.
Government planners say the country can count on average growth of 4.5 per
cent over the next few years. But for Mr Omar Kabbaj, a former IMF official
who in the present interim government of non-party technocrats holds the
wonderful title of 'minister in charge of stimulation of the economy', that
is not enough. The country needs to step up a gear to keep pace with the
demand for jobs.
Mr Kabbaj has set an ambitious objective of 6.5-7 per cent a year, including
in that target a 15 per cent annual increase in exports of finished
products. These expectations rely heavily on the private sector, although
Morocco has few private sector companies of any size by international
standards.
Around the beginning of this year, Morocco's population of at least 27m is
reckoned to have passed the threshold of being more than 50 per cent urban,
the result of a secular process of migration from the Saharan regions to the
rich Atlantic plains and from the countryside to the cities.
Urban unemployment now stands at around 16 per cent. In the farming areas
the rate is sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on the vagaries of the
climate. Population growth, although it has slowed, is running at 2 per cent
annually. There are expected to be a quarter of a million new arrivals on
the job market each year.
Though subject to periodic manifestations of discontent, Morocco has been
shielded from the kind of radical Islamic movement that has torn Algeria
apart and affected other countries in the region. Moroccan officials are
ever-anxious to underline the country's 'specificity' in this respect.
Essential to this 'specificity' are the religious credentials of the king
himself as a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed.
As a symbol of this role as 'Commander of the Believers' stands the
extraordinary new Hassan II mosque, dominating the Casablanca waterfront, a
lavish enterprise which took 10,000 craftsmen six years to build,
constructed on piles over the water, including a men's prayer area with room
for 20,000 and underfloor heating, and a sliding roof weighing 1,100 tonnes.
Criticism over its extravagance has subsided; most people seem proud of
having it.
Privately, however, senior Moroccan officials admit deep concern about the
implications of developments in Algeria. Neither the emergence of a
fundamentalist state in Algeria, nor the disintegration of Algeria as a
nation, could avoid having a profound impact on Morocco.
With its powerful interior ministry, Morocco keeps its own fundamentalist
groups under fairly heavy-handed control. Mr Abdessalam Yassine, leader of
Justice and Charity, the chief radical Islamic organisation, is under house
arrest, and no party would be allowed to contest elections under an Islamic
banner. Religious causes are mostly represented on the political scene by
Istiqlal, the old national independence party.
Moroccan sensitivity was shown up by the eruption of tensions between the
two countries in August after a shooting incident in Marrakesh in which two
Spanish tourists died. Rabat hastily imposed visa requirements on anyone of
Algerian nationality or origin. Algiers responded by closing the border. The
favoured theory in official Moroccan circles is that Algeria's secret
service was behind the attack.
The Algerian press has accused Morocco of turning a blind eye to weapons
crossing into Algeria, destined for armed Islamic groups crossing the
border. Many Algerians feel deep resentment towards Morocco, suspecting it
of playing a game to win the consent of a future Algerian Islamic government
to Rabat's sovereignty over the former Spanish Sahara.
Senior officials say Morocco needs to strengthen its 'antibodies against
contagion' from Algeria. These defences are twofold. One is economic growth
and wider participation in the country's wealth. The other is liberalisation
of its politics. The system that the king, now 65, will hand over to his
heir, Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed, will be considerably less undemocratic
than it was a few years ago.
All the strings of authority continue to be controlled, ultimately, by the
royal palace. But parliament - comprising a recondite collection of parties
 -has had its powers strengthened. It can send back budgets, question
ministers and bring up issues such as human rights.
More than 400 political prisoners were amnestied in July. Foreign experts
say there remain about 50 political detainees, mostly fundamentalists.
Newspapers these days sometimes show surprising freedom - the weekly
L'Economiste being an example of a new era in the Moroccan press.
Following a recent policy turnaround, the three Berber languages may now be
taught in state schools alongside Arabic, something Berber cultural
associations had long struggled for. Women's rights, although more
restricted than in Tunisia, have improved.
Opening parliament this month, the king repeated an offer made twice before
to left-wing and nationalist opposition parties, which were strengthened in
elections last year, to give them most of the cabinet posts and negotiate
alliances to form a parliamentary majority. The parties had previously
refused the conditions. This time the king, seeking 'alternation' in
government, added the offer of the premiership, held since May by Mr
Abdellatif Filali, a veteran diplomat. A new government could emerge by the
end of the year.
Whatever its shape, the government can be expected to press ahead with
efforts to liberalise and modernise the economy. But real political change
is likely to come at a slower pace.

prosperity

<TEXT>
More than 200,000 bridges in the US are structurally deficient or
functionally obsolete. If aluminium was specified in only one-third of all
bridge repair or replacement projects, at least an extra 400m lb a year of
the metal would be required.
Mr Richard Holder, chairman of Reynolds Metals, the world's third largest
aluminium company, gave these statistics yesterday in an upbeat presentation
about potential future demand for the material.
He suggested that the infrastructure market offered the industry tremendous
potential because many countries were faced with crumbling bridges and
highways, leaking water and sewer lines and ageing mass transit facilities.
Meanwhile, many developing countries were now creating infrastructure
systems.
Speaking at Alumitech 94 in Atlanta, the biggest exhibition and conference
about aluminium ever organised by the industry, Mr Holder also predicted
that the use of aluminium in North American cars would grow by another
two-thirds by the year 2000.
Having risen by 23 per cent last year to 210lb on average per car, it was
expected to rise to 350lb by the end of the decade. 'That projection may
even be conservative because it does not count on a lot of body sheet
applications which are looking more abundant by the day,' he added.
Mr Holder said there were tremendous prospects for aluminium beverage cans
outside the US, a country where the metal now had 98 per cent of the market
and where shipments this year would total more than 100bn cans for the first
time.
'Within the next 25 years, the aluminium beverage can will have as great a
presence within Latin America, the Middle East and eastern Europe as it has
today in the US,' he said.
Reynolds predicted a 65 per cent growth in the global aluminium beverage can
market by the year 2000.
Alumitech, sponsored by the US Aluminium Association, is designed to provide
a forum for exchanges of information on the most important technical,
environmental and market place issues facing the industry and has attracted
visitors from 30 countries to hear 120 speakers at 50 discussion sessions.
It takes place, as Mr Holder pointed out, when the aluminium industry is
turning a corner from the most difficult four years in its history.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Parisian exchange studying
wheat futures

Matif, the French futures and options market, is moving closer to developing
a new market for financial derivatives in wheat, its president said
yesterday.
The decision to launch the new market would depend on liberalisation of the
existing regulations controlling the price of wheat and is unlikely to take
place for a number of months.
Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, Matif president, said: 'Wheat prices are not determined
by the market but by technocrats in Brussels. They are still partially
subsidised. We are waiting for volatility of prices. We need a market game'.
Tomorrow the Matif launches a market in futures for rapeseed, in response to
deregulation of the price for oilseeds in 1992. It already operates markets
for white sugar and potatoes.
Market officials said yesterday they would also consider the possibility of
developing futures products in related oilseed products, such as sunflower
oil, and in rapeseed options or other derivatives if the rapeseed futures
market proved successful.
Experts at Matif have been studying the possibility of developing wheat
products, but are reliant on the planned liberalisation of the determination
of the commodity's prices through reforms to the European Union's common
agricultural policy and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Mr Pfauwadel said he believed that one of the few potential growth areas for
developing new products at the Matif was in commodities, and particularly
agricultural products - reflecting the farming roots of French society.

COPPER prices soared at the London Metal Exchange yesterday as US investment
funds took up the baton from a strong European market. profit-taking set in,
as expected, but the three months delivery price still ended Dollars 49 up
at Dollars 2,635 a tonne. Earlier it had reached a 4-year high of Dollars
2,650.
Three months ALUMINIUM moved above Dollars 1,800 a tonne like a hot knife
through butter and hit Dollars 1,835 before speculators began to cash in
profits. It ended at Dollars 1,820, up Dollars 58.
The investment funds also found time to push London white SUGAR futures to
1994 highs, despite a dearth of fundamental news. The funds wanted to push
the market above resistance levels in order to set up potential profits,
traders explained.

Alusaf of South Africa said yesterday it would consider further expansion if
the metal's present price recovery was sustained, but only once its Hillside
project was up and running, reports Reuters from Johannesburg.
The company was due to start bringing on stream an extra 466,000 tonnes of
aluminium from mid-1995 at Hillside, but start-up had been brought forward
by five months and there was no room to accelerate it further, a company
official said as aluminium climbed to a four-year high of more than Dollars
1,800 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange.
However, if the price recovery was sustained Alusaf would accelerate its
long-term plans to upgrade potrooms B and C at its existing Bayside smelter.
That could produce an extra 40,000 tonnes of aluminium a year over current
annual output of 170,000 tonnes at Bayside.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recovery in iron ore prices
forecast as steel output surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A recovery in iron ore prices, which have been severely depressed for the
past three years, now seems imminent, according to government and industry
experts meeting in Geneva to review iron ore market developments.
The experts are predicting an upsurge in global steel production and
consequently in the world market for iron ore next year, following strong
demand in 1994. World iron ore exports are expected this year to rise by
more than last year's 8 per cent, when they totalled 398m tonnes.
This has not been enough so far to prevent another collapse in iron ore
prices, by nearly 20 per cent over 1993-94. Prices remain around 25-30 per
cent below the 1991 level, depressing export earnings despite higher
shipments. In 1993 iron ore trade transactions amounted to Dollars 7.55bn,
the lowest value since 1989, and in 1994 too lower prices are expected to
offset increased exports.
In 1995, however, the market is expected to improve sufficiently to push
prices up. Steel production is increasing all over the world, except in the
Commonwealth of Independent States and Africa, scrap prices are soaring and
demand for primary iron products is rising. The world supply of pellets and
lumps remains tight.
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, sponsor of the
three-day meeting that ended yesterday, says low prices have not been
conducive to new greenfield projects but companies are continuing to invest
in replacement and expanded capacity to assure long-term supply.
Four major projects have started this year, in Mauritania, Brazil, Australia
and Venezuela. Other projects are under way in Australia, Chile, China,
India and Sweden.
Meanwhile, ownership concentration in the iron ore industry is increasing,
according to Mr Magnus Ericsson, of Sweden's Raw Materials Group. He told
the meeting that the production share of the three biggest iron ore
companies had risen from 19 per cent in 1975 to 34 per cent in 1993. Cia
Vale do Rio Doce, a state-owned Brazilian producer, leads the field,
followed by Broken Hill of Australia and Britain's RTZ.
Mr Ericsson said this defied the trend to deconcentration in most of the
main non-ferrous minerals and metals markets. He attributed the difference
to the huge size of the iron ore industry and the potential for scale
economies, the presence of big deposits of high-grade ores and steep cost
barriers to entry.
Mr Ericsson noted that steel companies had weakened their grip on the iron
ore industry, with only four steel companies among the top ten producers.
The top 20 iron ore mining companies now included three Chinese, three
Russian, two Ukrainian and one Kazakh, he pointed out.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Super rice' could boost
harvests by 25 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new breed of 'super rice' that can produce 25 per cent more grain on the
same amount of land and help feed an additional 450m people a year has been
developed by scientists at the International Rice Research Institute, the
World Bank announces this week.
The new strain is capable of yielding 5 tonnes per acre on irrigated land
compared with 4 tonnes for existing varieties. If widely planted, the World
Bank estimates that the new breed of rice could produce 100m tonnes more
each year than is now grown.
This extra rice could help feed a population boom expected over the next 30
years when demand for rice is expected to increase by 70 per cent to 350m
tonnes.
'It's not possible to step up rice production dramatically by planting on
new land,' said Mr Ismail Serageldin, chairman of the World Bank's
consultation group on international agricultural research of which the rice
institute is part. He points out that good rice land is being lost to
expanding urban centres.
The rice institute has developed over 300 varieties over the past 30 years.
It has managed to increase the yield of its new breed by improving the grain
to straw ratio of the plant.
More tests need to be conducted on the new breed of rice before it can enter
commercial production, but the rice researchers are already trying to cross
it with other hybrids to improve yields further to a possible 6 tonnes per
acre.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal profits down for fifth
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The financial performance of the western world's non-ferrous minerals
producers deteriorated for the fifth successive year in 1993, according to
the annual analysis of nearly 200 companies by the Metals &amp; Minerals
Research Services consultancy group.
An improvement in the fortunes of precious metals producers failed to
compensate for further deterioration in those of the base metals businesses,
it suggests.
On two key ratios the industry recorded its worst result since MMRS started
collecting these statistics 15 years ago; operating profit margins were only
5.8 per cent and the average return on capital employed was down to 4.8 per
cent.
On most other ratios last year's performance was the worst since 1982.
According to MMRS, the industry's aggregate operating profit has fallen by
71 per cent since 1989. Nickel producers last year joined lead/zinc
companies in recording an operating loss while the slide for aluminium
producers has also been greater than the average.
However, MMRS says a clear ranking emerged in the minerals industry last
year, with gold and platinum producers leading profitability on all
measures; copper and diversified producers doing best among base metals;
aluminium ranking sixth-best (or fourth-worst) overall and nickel, lead/zinc
and silver companies generally in loss.
The analysis suggests that the industry's operating revenue fell last year
from Dollars 166bn to Dollars 148bn but its net earnings, after all charges,
rose from Dollars 425m to Dollars 673m. Nevertheless, this bottom line was
the worst in real terms since a loss was registered in 1982.
MMRS says the one bright spot in its analysis is gearing. 'Although high for
a number of individual producers and sectors, this ended last year little
different from historical norms,' it says.
'Unlike in the early 1980s, debt has been kept under control in the recent
market downturn. New issues of equity have also helped.'

The publication today of Ernst and Young's massive inquiry into the state of

At 1,610 pages the book UK GAAP: Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in
the UK, does more than justice to the 500 large companies which provide the
raw material in the form of their published accounts.
Originally designed to satisfy the in-house accountants at Ernst and Young
wanting to know the realities of applying standards and rules to company
accounts, it now has a wider audience.
With a sales target of 10,000 - compared to 8,000 in 1992 - it will this
year be taken to the university-student market. It is a standard reference
work - but it is also more than that, and therein lies its power.
The detailed study of accounting practice on which it is based gives the
authors a unique insight into what worries, confuses, or angers Britain's
leading financial directors and their teams.
The verdict of the authors is stark: 'In spite of the best efforts of the
Accounting Standards Board, financial reporting in the UK remains in a state
of some turmoil.'
According to the authors, wrangles over issues such as goodwill and brands
reflect a conflict of interests between preparers and users of accounts.
'If the ASB is not able to find acceptable solutions to these issues, the
possibility remains that the regulation of financial reporting will be taken
out of the hands of accountants and placed with a body less sympathetic to
the interests of the accountancy profession,' they warn.
The book hardly promotes harmony by then attacking the ASB: its new
standards are too complex to absorb, or too hastily drafted and
over-simplified. A gap looms between theory and practice - particularly for
small companies.
While the picture in terms of regulation seems dire, the authors find -
oddly - that the accounts of large companies have hardly been better. Not
only are statistical cores of financial statements improving, but so are
their accompanying narrative sections.
This state of affairs is put down to the ASB's development of the operating
and financial review (OFR). The Cadbury Committee on Corporate Governance
adopted the OFR as a forward-looking assessment of a company's health.
It should contain analytical discussion and a review of trends, and be
clear, succinct and understandable to the 'general reader'. It was published
by the ASB as a statement of best practice in July 1993.
UK GAAP also considers the quest for a conceptual framework for financial
reporting. Like the holy grail this is much sought after, particularly in
the US, but rarely glimpsed. The authors think they have the measure of the
ASB's own statement of principles - and they don't like the look of it.
'What we see is an approach which is radically different from that applied
by most companies at present: one which focuses attention on the balance
sheet and measures performance by the total movement in equity.'
The authors of UK GAAP believe that the founding principle of UK financial
reporting is historic cost accounting with current values supplied only as
extra information. They envisage accounting centred on transactions in the
past, not assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.
The authors believe the ASB does not realise how fundamental the difference
is between the two approaches and it urges the board to stop now and
reconsider. 'There is no point in adopting a framework on the basis of its
apparent theoretical appeal, only to find that it then results in accounting
standards that no one wants.'
The authors deserve some credit for not leaving the argument at that point.
They acknowledge that the ASB has done some courageous and valuable work.
While they disagree with its statement of principles, they suggest a hybrid
set of the same should be produced, incorporating more than one accounting
model.
This plan has a certain elegance. Different sets of users would be provided
with different accounts, tailored to their needs, certainly not containing
less information but rather the right information in the right form. The
data could be shown as 'multi-column reporting' or 'layered' accounts.
Among the hundreds of other issues tackled in the book is the so-called 'big
GAAP/little GAAP' - the debate over whether small companies should have
fewer rules, no rules, or different rules to those of big companies. The
authors show that efforts to set up two sets of standards, such as a
Canadian attempt in British Columbia, contain 'insurmountable difficulties.'
At present the UK profession is awaiting publication of a special
working-group report on the issue chaired by Ken Wild of Touche Ross. All
the indications are that it will propose a draconian cutting back of
regulations governing 'small' companies - those with an annual turnover of
less than Pounds 2.8m.
The authors of UK GAAP think this is a mistake. They consider size an
arbitrary criteria. Instead they see a division between large companies and
owner-managed companies. After all, they argue, small companies are not just
simpler versions of big companies. The users of their accounts have quite
different needs to the average shareholder.
'Companies with a limited number of (management) members, all involved in
the day-to-day operations, should be able to incorporate under a different
and specially designed limited liability regime,' says the book. The users
of owner-managed company accounts are internal, bankers or the Inland
Revenue. The accounts should be different to fulfil their needs.
UK GAAP also reviews the progress of the various accounting standards
introduced in recent years. The story of FRS 3 is instructive and again
illustrates the authors' uneasy admiration for the work of the ASB in
contrast to their impatience at the shortcomings of aspects of the code it
produces.
FRS 3 virtually abolished extraordinary items and brought all remaining such
charges above the earnings line, as well as introducing new disclosures. It
changed the face of the profit and loss account.
Unfortunately it appears that some companies are over creative within the
new framework. 'It seems that the market is often too easily misled by some
companies' innovative use of FRS 3's layered approach to the profit and loss
account to divert attention away from the overall total result for which
management is accountable.'
The authors see this as part of a 'jousting match' between the ASB, which
wants the accounts to portray the overall picture, and parts of the
financial community, particularly analysts, who still fall hungrily on a
'magic number' in the accounts that they trust will reveal all.
Finally the authors see in FRS 3 the first 'manifestation of the ASB's
balance sheet approach to income recognition as outlined in the statement of
principles.' The standard, they say, focuses on changes in wealth rather
than traditional historical cost accounting. They object to this concept
being entrenched in UK practice without proper debate.
The debate, wherever it rages, will be better for this book. But one has to
spare a thought for the authors, already contemplating the gigantic task of
writing the fifth edition in 1996.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts lurch lower after auction
disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Most European bond markets drifted lower in a narrow range yesterday,
remaining in the thrall of US Treasuries, where all eyes are on tomorrow's
release of third-quarter GDP data.
New supply in the UK, German and US markets, amid continued investor
abstinence, also damped market sentiment.
UK gilts weakened on the day, with the December long gilt futures contract
on Liffe shedding  7/16 point to 99 9/32 .
Prices lurched lower after the Bank of England announced the results of the
auction of Pounds 2.5bn 8 per cent gilts due 2000. The biggest
disappointment was the fact that the auction was only 1.2 times covered  -
the lowest bid-to-cover ratio this year, and well below the 1.5 to 1.75
cover most market participants had forecast. The tail - the difference
between the highest and the average accepted yield - was in line with
forecasts at two basis points.
Dealers were also disappointed that 93 per cent of the bids were allocated
at the lowest accepted price of 96.01, yielding 8.84 per cent. The highest
accepted price was 96.24.
Dealers cited various explanations for the disappointing result. 'This is
not an area favoured by overseas investors, who prefer the 10-year sector,'
said Mr Don Smith, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. UK life insurers
and pension funds, which tend to go for longer maturities to match their
long-term liabilities, also showed little interest in the issue, said one
dealer.
Increased fears of another near-term tightening in UK interest rates also
put a damper on the auction's performance, said another dealer.
Moreover, 'the Bank has issued a lot of tranchettes and the market has had
to absorb a lot of supply in recent weeks,' said Mr Adam Chester, economist
at Yamaichi International. 'This, on top of the previous supply, tipped the
balance against the market.'
German bonds ended the day slightly lower, but bund futures staged a smart
rally in after-hours trading on remarks by Bundesbank vice-president Mr
Johann Wilhelm Gaddum.
He cautioned against inferring too quickly that a change in the terms for
the Bundesbank's weekly securities repurchase agreements signalled a shift
in interest rate policy.
This sparked speculation that the Bundesbank will soon revert to
variable-rate repos, its favoured way of conducting open-market operations,
after 14 weeks of fixed-rate repos, paving the way for lower short-term
interest rates.
US Treasury bond prices back-tracked yesterday despite marginally favourable
economic news, after the market failed to follow through on a well-received
supply auction during the afternoon.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/16 at
93 5/8 , with the yield rising to 8.06 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 15/16 , to yield 6.892 per cent.
Bonds on the long end opened firmer while the short end held steady, thanks
to a mildly encouraging reading on durable goods last month. The Commerce
Department reported that factory orders had risen 0.1 per cent in September,
after a big gain the previous month.
However, the market made scant progress on the data, with most traders
braced for the year's sixth boost in short-term interest rates sometime next
month. In addition, many were concerned that Friday's estimate of
third-quarter GDP would suggest the economy was accelerating as it entered
the year's final leg.
Bonds across the board were hovering close to opening values until early
afternoon, despite another poor performance by the dollar and an unsettling
upturn in commodity prices.
The damage came on the heels of the Treasury's auction of Dollars 11bn in
five-year notes. Although the previous day's sale of two-year notes had
generated tepid demand, yesterday's auction drew fairly good interest among
dealers and retail accounts. The issue was awarded at a lower yield than had
been expected.
But prices stumbled soon afterwards. With cautiousness prevailing ahead of
GDP data coming out at the end of the week, bonds could not build any
forward momentum in the wake of the well-bid auction.
Russia's first issue of 12-month zero-coupon Treasury bills yielded an
average of 450.05 per cent at auction, according to the Moscow Interbank
Currency Exchange, Reuter reports.
The finance ministry set the minimum price at 22.56 per cent of par while
dealers' bids ranged from 9 to 50 per cent. Demand was for Rbs274.3bn
against Rbs200bn on offer, but only Rbs60.5bn worth of the paper - 30.25 per
cent of the issue - sold.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Borrowers target deals at retail
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The euromarket saw a selection of carefully targeted deals yesterday,
following the trend of short-dated issues.
Poland is planning its debut eurobond, believed to be a Dollars 200m
five-year deal for next spring, and the Spanish province of Andalusia is
believed to be bringing a five-year deal. An AAA-rated borrower is rumoured
to be preparing a 20-year peseta deal.
Bayerische Vereinsbank came to the market for the second day running. Lead
manager Hambros reported 'a very good first-day response' for the ADollars
100m five-year deal with a 10 per cent coupon. Other syndicate managers
praised the pricing on the deal, which followed offerings for NAB and
Commerzbank this year. Hambros said the spread on those deals had tightened
in since launch.
Also in the Australian dollar sector, Nomura handled a three-year ADollars
100m deal for New South Wales Treasury Corp with a 4.5 per cent coupon and a
price of 88.961. Other syndicate managers said the coupon and price
suggested it was aimed at Tokyo investors.
CSFB also targeted the DSL Finance DM300m four-year deal with a 7 1/8 per
cent coupon at a strong lead order out of Switzerland.
JP Morgan used the same currency and maturity to bring a DM250m four-year
deal with a 7 1/4 per cent coupon for JP Morgan &amp; Co aimed at retail demand
on the European continent. Investors pick up 36 basis points by moving one
year out along the curve to the four-year area. Morgan said the 10-year bund
contract was trading around 88.85 at launch but fell back to 88.63. The
bonds came at a spread of 14 basis points over and Morgan said they were
trading at between 14 and 17.
Wood Gundy handled a seven-year CDollars 165m deal with a 9 per cent coupon
for the European Investment Bank which received positive comments from other
houses. One said: 'This deal will work well.'
Manhattan Card Co brought a Dollars 200m offering guaranteed by credit
card-backed assets in Hong Kong and lead-manager Chase Securities said most
demand for the deal had come from Europe.

James Capel, the UK stockbroker, has obtained a listing on the London Stock
Exchange for its HSBC China Fund investment trust, in order to boost
liquidity in the shares.
Its shares have been trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange since June
1992. However, they are trading at a discount of 20 per cent to net asset
value, the largest discount of any similar vehicle.
The HSBC China Fund will be the first London-based vehicle to offer direct
access to investment in China. The mandate is to split investments equally
between listed and unlisted Chinese companies.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Setback for CME chief as
members reject merger plan
</HEADLINE>

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A plan to merge the two most powerful divisions of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the CME and the International Monetary Market, failed to obtain
the required two-thirds majority in a membership referendum this week.
The defeat was a setback for Mr Jack Sandner, the CME chairman, and the
exchange's board of governors, who had recommended the merger as a way to
give the IMM's bank members a broader voice in exchange governance, and to
bring new blood into the CME's low-volume agricultural pits.
With 90 per cent of the exchange's membership voting, 3,307 voted in favour
and 2,439 against.
The measure failed to win the required majority in part because of
aggressive campaigning against the merger by Mr Leo Melamed, who founded the
IMM more than 20 years ago, but for the past three years has not been active
in CME affairs.
Mr Melamed contended that a merger of the IMM and CME could bring unexpected
consequences, and that there were other, less intrusive ways to give IMM
membership greater representation at the exchange.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Italian SE to launch options
on MIB index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian stock exchange is planning to introduce a range of options
contracts over the next year, including new options on individual shares
which make up the MIB index.
Mr Attilio Ventura, chairman of the exchange, said that there were also
plans to introduce options contracts on the exchange's new stock index
future which is based on the MIB index. Trading in the stock index future
itself is set to begin on November 28.
The new options on individual shares will be exercisable any time during the
life of the option. The options on individual shares quoted on the Milan
bourse, known as premi, are typically of short duration and are exercised at
maturity.
Mr Ventura said the new derivatives products were being introduced as part
of efforts to increase liquidity following a big increase in interest from
overseas investors. Daily trading volumes in Milan have increased sharply in
recent years.
Trading in all the new derivatives products will be screen based. The
exchange is also planning to introduce a secondary market for small and
medium-sized companies.
Earlier this week NatWest Markets introduced a market in warrants related to
each constituent part of the MIB - made up of the shares of 30 leading
companies - and said it would create a liquid secondary market by publishing
'live' two-way prices on Reuters.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kramat Tin in share swap with
AOI
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kramat Tin Dredging, the listed subsidiary of Malaysia Mining Corporation
(MMC), plans a share swap with Artika Optima Inti (AOI) of Indonesia in a
deal estimated to be worth USDollars 145m.
Kramat will gain a 32 per cent stake in AOI, while AOI will hold about 25
per cent of Kramat.
The Kramat/AOI deal is subject to approval by both the Kuala Lumpur and
Jakarta stock exchange authorities.
MMC was once one of the world's biggest tin conglomerates but in recent
years has diversified away from mining. AOI is part of the Djajanti Group,
one of Indonesia's biggest timber companies.
Analysts say the deal allows Kramat to focus its attention on the
potentially lucrative timber industry, while giving AOI the opportunity of a
'back door' listing on the Kuala Lumpur exchange.
Earlier this year AOI was refused approval for a public offering on the
Jakarta stock exchange after the Indonesian government said that the company
had failed to abide by the terms of its forestry concessions.
AOI has announced plans to build a large cement plant in eastern Indonesia.
In June PT Barito Pacific, one of Indonesia's largest companies, entered
into a complex shares and cash deal with Malaysia's Construction and
Supplies company.
Analysts said that deal, still subject to approval from the Malaysian
securities authorities, would allow Barito to raise funds on the highly
liquid Kuala Lumpur market.

<TEXT>
Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics manufacturer which is a dominant
maker of liquid crystal displays, increased non-consolidated recurring
profits - before extraordinary items and tax - by 55 per cent in the first
six months to end-September, on the strength of buoyant demand for its LCD
panels and other electronic devices.
The company said that in spite of persistent weakness in corporate capital
investment, demand for its goods, combined with rationalisation measures,
helped it to achieve a 7 per cent increase in sales to Y615.3bn (Dollars
6.35bn) compared with Y575.2bn a year ago.
Operating profits more than doubled to Y25.2bn from Y11.9bn, while recurring
profits surged 55 per cent to Y31.1bn from Y20.2bn. Net profits rose 24 per
cent to Y15.6bn from Y12.6bn.
Sharp, which has a leading position in the market for LCD panels, has
benefited from strong demand, particularly from US personal computer in the
US. LCD sales totalled Y113.2bn in the first half, compared with Y187.5bn
for the whole of fiscal 1993.
As a result, its electronic components division saw sales rise 23 per cent
to Y207.3bn from Y168.4bn.
In contrast, the television and video equipment division reported a 4 per
cent decline in sales to Y122.9bn on continuing weak demand.
Mr Haruo Tsuji, president, said recently that he expected the company's LCD
operations to continue providing growth for the company for some time.
Sharp is building the world's largest LCD factory in Japan, which is
expected to begin operations next year and has expanded its existing
facility. Sharp expects LCD sales of Y245bn in the full year, against
forecast overall industry sales of Y540bn.
Sharp is shifting the manufacture of some products overseas and procuring a
greater volume of parts from abroad in order to combat the adverse effects
of the high yen. As a result, it expects to increase sales by 6 per cent in
the full year to Y1,240bn on the strength of continued demand for devices.
Sharp is looking for a 41 per cent rise in recurring profits to Y64bn in the
year to March, and a 31 per cent increase in net profits to Y33.5bn.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Packer finds his investors
obliging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Anyone know any good jokes?' quipped Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian
businessman, as yesterday's unquestioning acceptance by shareholders of a
plan to merge his two publicly-quoted media companies into a ADollars 2bn
(USDollars 1.47bn) combined group necessitated a lull in formal proceedings.
The complex series of shareholder votes had been scheduled at appropriate
intervals to allow for discussion. So obliging were the investors in
Australian Consolidated Press, the Packer-controlled magazines business, and
Nine Network Australia, which runs Australia's leading commercial TV
network, that business from one meeting was completed early, and
shareholders left to twiddle their thumbs before the next could start.
Under the circumstances, Mr Packer's cheeriness was scarely surprising. By
the end of the day, he had won approvals from ACP and Nine shareholders for
the creation of a new three-pronged media group, and now requires only court
sanction for the transaction to go ahead.
With the deal being effected by a share swap arrangement, Consolidated
Press, the private Packer company, will emerge with a 45.7 per cent interest
in the new group - to be known as Publishing and Broadcasting  - in contrast
to its 47.9 per cent stake in ACP and 44.5 per cent of NNA. Mr Packer will
become chairman of the new entity, with Mr Brian Powers, managing director
of ConsPress, taking on the same role at P &amp; B as well.
The new group will be made up of three divisions: television, magazines,
investments (this will include Nine's interest in John Fairfax, the
Australian newspaper publisher, and the potential stake in Optus, the
telecommunications group). P &amp; B is likely to have a market capitalisation
above ADollars 2bn, revenues of more than ADollars 1bn, shareholder funds of
ADollars 1.7bn, and immediate borrowing facilities of ADollars 1.3bn. All
this, it is argued, will make acquisitions much easier.
The deal will also take some immediate pressure off the magazine interests,
which have been battling against highly-competitive conditions.
The big question is what acquisitions the merged group will pursue. The
prospectuses make clear that on the magazine front, the focus will be on
Asia, where ACP has already picked up a stake in the Vietnam Investment
Review, rather than the more mature Australasian markets.
Nine, meanwhile, has already been edging into the multimedia industry. Aside
from the Optus connection, for example, it has joined forces with Village
Roadshow, a cinemas group, to run 'out-of-home' entertainment centres,
including indoor theme parks in shopping centres across Australia. Nine was
also one of the vehicles through which Mr Packer pursued his abortive bid to
build Sydney's new casino.
The price, for ACP shareholders, will be some dilution of earnings per
share, but Nine's stronger growth prospects mean that it is already more
highly rated, and if the acquisition opportunities look good enough, the
shares of the new company should trade on a higher multiple that those of
ACP. Such thoughts, at least, seemed to be buying peace from shareholders
yesterday.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Arco takes stake in Chinese
refinery

<TEXT>
Atlantic Richfield (Arco), the US oil and natural gas group, has
conditionally taken up 237.6m shares in Zhenhai Refining and Chemical
Company, one of the biggest refineries in China which will next month launch
a public offering in Hong Kong.
The stake will give Arco some 9.9 per cent of the registered capital of
Zhenhai. The stock has not yet been priced, but the company is understood to
be aiming to sell its shares on a multiple between 10.2 and 12.5 with an
issue price range between HKDollars 2.05 and HKDollars 2.50.
Arco's interest is a vote of confidence in a company which is perceived  -
in Hong Kong at least - to have problems. In May, Beijing reimposed controls
on the pricing, import and distribution of crude oil and oil products and,
in spite of attempts by Zhenhai's parent, Sinopec (China Petrochemical
Corporation), to smooth the impact of this, the company is seen as being in
effect unable to control the pricing of its products.
While analysts see the introduction of a foreign partner as a positive sign,
many caution there is no direct corollary with this and expansion in
overseas markets. In July 1993 Tsingtao Brewery, the first mainland company
to list in Hong Kong, sold 5 per cent of its shares to Anheuser Busch, the
US brewer, but appears to have had little help in building markets abroad.
Zhenhai is due to release its prospectus early next month, with the initial
public offering pencilled in for November 15. It plans to issue 600m shares,
or 25 per cent of the company, to raise HKDollars 1.2bn (USDollars 155m) to
HKDollars 1.5bn. It will become the 12th mainland company to have its
primary listing in Hong Kong.

Dickson Concepts, the Hong Kong based luxury wholesaler and retailer, is
bringing Bugs Bunny and Batman to Hong Kong through a franchise arrangement
with Warner Bros Consumer Products.
Dickson, which is putting more than HKDollars 150m (USDollars 19.4m) into
the project, plans to open Hong Kong and Singapore flagship stores selling
exclusive clothing, jewellery, accessories and memorabilia of Warner Bros'
cartoons and superheroes around the middle of next year. Further outlets
will follow.
This is the first time Warner Bros has taken a partner to open and operate
stores. Outlets in Europe and the US - which will total 110 by the year-end
 -are company-owned, but it was felt local expertise would be important in
developing the Asia market. Dickson Concepts will pay a royalty fee to
Warner Bros.
Mr Dickson Poon, chairman and controlling shareholder of the group, believes
the project will become a significant contributor to company profits -
although he said it was too early to say if Tweety Pie T-shirts and Daffy
Duck mugs could be taken to China, where he has already taken Ralph Lauren
clothing.
Dickson will be financing the deal from its cash resources. In spite of
opening 50 stores throughout Asia in the past 12 months, the company - which
also owns the Harvey Nichols store in London - is in a net cash position,
and will remain so after the latest investment.
Mr Barry Gilbert, a senior vice-president with Warner Bros in California,
said the consumer products arm wanted to expand worldwide as rapidly as
possible.
He was unperturbed by the prospect of problems with counterfeiting in Asia,
in spite of being temporarily based in Tsim Tsa Tsui, the heartland of copy
watches and clothes depicting Walt Disney and Warner Bros characters with
varying degrees of skill and accuracy.

<TEXT>
Fanuc, a Japanese maker of machine-tool equipment, said profits for the
first six months to September increased sharply due to cost-cutting measures
and streamlining of operations.
Unconsolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - for
the first half rose 13.4 per cent to Y13.2bn (Dollars 136m) in spite of a 4
per cent fall in sales to Y54bn. Orders for the first six months rose 17.2
per cent to Y61.6bn, and after-tax profits rose 8.3 per cent to Y7bn.
Operating costs fell 9.6 per cent to Y43.6bn resulting in a rise in
operating profits by 29.9 per cent to Y10.4bn.
Non-operating profits fell 26 per cent and non-operating costs fell by 53.9
per cent. Sales in Fanuc's factory automation division fell 4.1 per cent to
Y33.6bn, and its robot division fell 11.3 per cent to Y15bn.
The company said it would raise dividends for the current business year to
Y20 a share from Y18, due to the profit growth.
For the full year to March, the company expects a 6.8 per cent rise in sales
to Y113.5bn and a 24 per cent rise in recurring profits to Y28.5bn.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Matif ready to launch
rapeseed futures - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Today, just a few cleaners and electricians are quietly carrying out their
tasks around a nondescript polygonal desk at the Bourse de Commerce building
in Paris. From tomorrow, in their place will be traders and officials
noisily getting to work on the first day of a new derivatives market.
The latest product from Matif, the French financial futures market, is
rapeseed futures - only the second in the world after Winnipeg, Canada.
'After two years' hard work, we've done it]' says Mr Charles-Etienne de
Cidrac, business development manager.
Rapeseed production began in earnest in Europe in the 1970s, in response to
agricultural policies designed to make the continent less reliant on US
soyabean imports for vegetable oils and animal feeds. The crop's yellow
flowers are now a familiar sight, with 1993-94 production in the EU running
at 6.2m tonnes, or nearly a quarter of the world total. In France alone,
last year's crop was 1.6m tonnes.
However, for many years the price of rapeseed was controlled through the
EU's common agricultural policy and was only deregulated in reforms in July
1992.
French farming syndicates approached the Matif at the time to ask for a way
of hedging against the volatility of the product.
Contracts on the new market will be available for between 4 and 19 months
from tomorrow - the deliberately high maximum expiry date reflecting
interest by the rapeseed industry in understanding long-term price trends.
Mr de Cidrac says a number of features distinguish the market from others
operated by Matif. It will operate using traditional brokers who operate
across the range of its products, but also with physical brokers trading
only in rapeseed.
It will use the 'open outcry' system, but also have 'order book officials',
or Matif staff, to buy and sell for others. It will be quoted in D-Marks,
the strong currency in the continent from where most demand is expected.
Foreign exchange forward contracts, to hedge into US dollars and French
francs, will also be offered.
Mr Gerard Pfauwadel, president of Matif, says rapeseed represents one of the
few new types of product into which his organisation can diversify. It
already offers most of the financial products it believes are viable;
commodities derivatives represent a remaining area of growth - and one he
sees as attractive in France, given its strong agricultural roots.
Almost 1,000 people have attended Matif training sessions on the rapeseed
market since the start of the year. When it opens tomorrow, there will be 15
traders at the 17 available spaces around the table.
'The question is whether the interest will turn into trading,' says Mr de
Cidrac.
'It's a new contract for a big number of participants. As long as it is
traded we will continue, and do more marketing if necessary. We are obliged
to operate the markets. For us it's a strategic move. We are looking to
provide a service to customers rather than find a source of profit.'
Mr Pfauwadel says: 'Rapeseed is a new product and a test for others. It is
clearly not a big contract. If we had more than 300 contracts a day I would
be extremely happy. We are rich enough to support a low volume for a certain
period - certainly the first full season and probably several years.'
If things go well, Mr de Cidrac says there is the possibility - not yet
under serious discussion - of options in rapeseed, and futures in related
products such as sunflower oil. More generally, Matif is considering
contracts in wheat and other commodities as their prices are liberalised.
On the other hand, there is no guarantee of success. Coffee futures were
dropped in April this year through lack of interest. More poignant still,
the very trading room in which rapeseed futures will be based has been empty
for two years, since Matif abandoned its cocoa futures market.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lion Nathan in move to expand
into China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lion Nathan is planning up to three breweries in China as a way of
diversifying from the mature Australian and New Zealand beer markets, Mr
Douglas Myers, Lion chief executive, said yester-day.
The announcement came as Lion Nathan, the biggest brewer in both countries,
reported a 45 per cent rise in profits to NZDollars 204m (USDollars 124.9m)
in the year to August 31. Its brands include Castlemaine XXXX, Tooheys, Swan
and Steinlager.
Mr Myers said the first of its Chinese investments, a joint venture in
Shanghai, was likely to be confirmed in December. He said that because of
the risks involved, Lion Nathan wanted to be the leading partner. It was
considering 'green field' developments because of the vast overmanning in
Chinese breweries which used 300 to 400 per cent more staff than was
required.
He hinted that the initial investment would be around NZDollars 100m and
would stem from the company's strong cash flows of NZDollars 230m.
Mr Myers showed frustration at analysts' criticism that the company is
burdened with 'mature' products and intense competition in world markets: a
view that has caused its share price to perform poorly.
He said that the company had done everything analysts had demanded, and yet
its share price was lower than when it was deep in debt. Its balance sheet
had been strengthened by asset sales and high cash flows which had reduced
net debt by NZDollars 271m over the past year. The debt to equity ratio was
38.62 at August 31, compared with 47.53 the year before.
The dividend is being lifted to 15 cents a share from 13.5 cents last year.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: FTC agrees to Dollars 4bn Eli
Lilly deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, has reached an outline agreement with the
US's Federal Trade Commission which will allow it to go ahead with the
planned Dollars 4bn acquisition of PCS, a pharmaceuticals distributor,
writes Richard Waters in New York.
The deal, full details of which have yet to be finalised, is expected to act
as a model for how two other drugs companies - Merck and SmithKline Beecham
 -operate similar drugs distributors that they have acquired in recent
months.
Lilly, while refusing to confirm that it had reached a provisional deal with
the anti-trust authorities, said it believed a final agreement would be
completed by next Thursday. This would open the way for completion of the
PCS acquisition before the end of the year.
The deal with the FTC is believed to require PCS to continue to offer drugs
made by companies other than Lilly. It will also establish arrangements to
prevent Lilly from gaining access to information about the prices at which
other companies sell their drugs to PCS.
Yesterday, Lilly sought to play down the significance of both aspects of the
agreement. However, concern that the deal would limit its ability to earn
the sort of profits it had hoped for from the PCS acquisition left the
company's share price Dollars  5/8 lower at Dollars 60 yesterday.
Merck said that it had also been asked for information during the FTC
investigation into Lilly, though it refused to say whether the regulators
were examining its dealings with Medco, its own distributor.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pennzoil to pay Dollars 454m
extra tax on settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Pennzoil said it had reached agreement with the US authorities to pay
Dollars 454m in additional taxes on a Dollars 3bn settlement it received
from rival US energy group Texaco six years ago.
The amount is less than half the Dollars 957m tax assessment by the Internal
Revenue Service earlier this year.
The taxes stem from the settlement of a dispute between Pennzoil and Texaco
over the latter's takeover of Getty Oil in 1986. The acquisition thwarted a
deal that had already been agreed between Pennzoil and Getty.
A Texas jury initially awarded Pennzoil Dollars 10.3bn in damages, forcing
Texaco to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, has outlined plans to
sell four mines in the US and Canada, and to expand the Latin American
operations which it acquired as part of its recent takeover of Lac Minerals.
Mr Alan Hill, executive vice-president, said yesterday that Barrick plans to
develop four new gold operations over the next four years. First will be a
new mill at the existing Tambo mine in Chile, which is due to be
commissioned early next year.
This will be followed by the Meikle mine, which adjoins Barrick's flagship
Goldstrike property in Nevada; the Cerro Corona mine in Peru; and the Nevada
mine, also in Chile.
Barrick also recently acquired stakes in two exploration properties on the
Argentine side of the El Indio belt.
The properties for sale are the Macassa and Golden Patricia mines in
Ontario, Bullfrog in Nevada and the Red Mountain deposit in British
Columbia. Barrick will retain the Bousquet complex and its 50 per cent stake
in the adjoining Doyon mine in northern Quebec.
Annual output from existing Barrick mines and the retained Lac assets is
currently about 2.5m ounces, making Barrick the biggest gold producer
outside South Africa.
Mr Hill indicated that the company will outline more detailed plans for the
development of its Latin American assets next February.

Marion Merrell Dow and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the US pharmaceutical groups,
both showed solid revenue gains in the third quarter, but only RPR, a
subsidiary of France's Rhone-Poulenc, was able to boost its bottom line.
At MMD, a 10 per cent improvement in sales, to Dollars 783m, largely
reflected two acquisitions completed over the past year. The company,
controlled by Dow Chemical, bought the Rugby Group, a generic drug
manufacturer, late last year and Kodama, a Japanese pharmaceuticals group,
in early 1994.
Excluding their contributions, revenues would have showed a 6 per cent
decline from Dollars 709m a year ago.
Sales of Cardizem, a cardiovascular medication, were down 1 per cent,
although a strong performance by the lower-margin Cardizem CD, a once-a-day
formulation of the product, helped to offset the loss. Sales of Seldane, an
allergy remedy whose patent expired last April, were down 10 per cent.
RPR credited robust sales of its prescription products, especially in North
America, for an 8 per cent rise in revenues to Dollars 1.04bn. Profits were
up 45 per cent at Dollars 102.5m, or 76 cents a share, against Dollars 71m,
or 51 cents, a year ago. The 1993 figure reflected a pre-tax charge of
Dollars 27m, or 13 cents.
The results, which were slightly better than Wall Street had forecast,
represent a turnround of sorts from the second quarter, when earnings had
come in well under expectations. On Wall Street yesterday, RPR's share price
closed Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 36 1/4 .
Although MMD suffered a 12 per cent slide in profits to Dollars 126m, or 45
cents, the result exceeded analysts' forecasts of 36 cents. The stock made
steady headway as a result, closing Dollars 1 higher on the day at Dollars
25 3/4 .
For the first nine months of 1994, MMD posted earnings of Dollars 330m,
against Dollars 375m, excluding a Dollars 180m pre-tax charge. Revenues were
up 9 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn.
At RPR, net income for the nine months was Dollars 168.8m, against Dollars
284.8m, on revenues of Dollars 2.88bn, virtually unchanged from a year ago.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Learning lessons the difficult
way - Richard Waters examines the issues raised by yesterday's ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US anti-trust authorities may have put a spanner in the works of one of the
biggest reorganisations to hit the country's pharmaceuticals industry.
Fifteen months ago, Merck turned the industry on its head by buying Medco
Containment Services, a big distribution company. The deal sparked a race
among drugs manufacturers to secure their distribution lines.
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has now put a question mark over this
vertical integration strategy. In particular, it raises doubts about the
wisdom of the three companies, which between them will have paid Dollars
13bn to buy distributors, once Eli Lilly's Dollars 4bn purchase of PCS is
completed (in the other deal, SmithKline Beecham paid Dollars 2.3bn for
Diversified Pharmaceutical Services).
The commission has yet to outline publicly its concerns about the Lilly
deal. Indeed, until it publishes the full details of the compromise it has
reached with the company, it will not even confirm that it has held an
investigation.
The outline of the deal, however, suggests that the FTC's concern is that
control of distribution by a small number of manufacturers could limit the
ability of other drugs makers to sell their products. The result, in the
long run, could be less choice and higher prices for consumers.
Although the deal with the FTC applies only to Lilly, it is likely to have a
bearing on how Merck and SmithKline operate. Both companies cleared a review
by the agency when completing their own purchases, but the FTC says:
'Theoretically, the commission can go back and re-examine things on which it
has passed before.'
Two issues lie at the heart of the Lilly investigation. The first is whether
other drugs manufacturers will have fair access to PCS's distribution system
once it is acquired; in general, the deal will require the company to offer
all other manufacturers' products for sale alongside its own.
Pharmacy benefit managers such as PCS generally reduce costs for buyers of
drugs by offering only a limited range of products, known as a formulary.
The drugs included on this list are those on which the distributor can
negotiate bigger discounts, or which are cheaper than rival products. The
benefit managers encourage doctors to prescribe these formulary drugs
through direct telephone contact.
However, PCS will have to offer the option of an 'open' formulary - one
which contains any drug the customer wants - which could reduce the
competitive advantage to the company of controlling the distributor. Lilly,
however, argues that this requirement makes no difference to the attraction
of owning PCS, and that it was planning to offer the option of an open
formulary anyway.
Both Merck and SmithKline say they already offer open formularies to their
customers.
The second issue of concern to the FTC is the potential misuse of
competitive pricing information. The regulators fear that Lilly could gain
access to details of the prices at which other drugs companies are selling
their products to PCS, and use this to undercut competitors. To prevent
this, it has required Lilly to agree to a 'firewall' to keep the information
confidential. This, again, is an arrangement that all three companies say
they can live with.
If the drugs companies are right in their claims that the Lilly consent
decree will make no material difference to their businesses, why are the
regulators showing such interest?
One possible answer is that the FTC is acting politically. With the new
spirit of anti-trust zeal under the Clinton administration, it could not
appear to be taking no action amid such a significant industrial
restructuring.
Alternatively, the deal with Lilly may have more teeth than the
manufacturers yet realise, or are prepared to admit. Either way, they still
have a long way to go to prove to shareholders that buying distribution
companies will support profits in the long term - and past experience is not
encouraging.
The biggest previous attempt to pursue this strategy in the healthcare field
 -the Dollars 4bn acquisition of American Hospital Supply by Baxter
International, a hospital supplies and healthcare company, in 1985 - proved
a failure. Last year, half of Baxter's sales in the US came from hospital
supplies, but only a quarter of profits. Nor has the deal lifted the
company's market share. It is a lesson that the drugs companies could yet
learn to their cost.

Tenneco, the diversified US industrial group, had its best third quarter in
11 years as its packaging and construction and farm equipment divisions
outperformed expectations.
Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's chairman, said the strong quarter demonstrated the
effectiveness of the company's restructuring.
Net income amounted to Dollars 151m, or 82 cents a share, compared with
Dollars 111m, or 64 cents, for the same period last year. Sales rose to
Dollars 3.3bn, from Dollars 3.1bn a year ago. Operating income rose to
Dollars 363m, from Dollars 273m.
As expected, Tenneco yesterday also said it had agreed to purchase German
automotive components maker Heinrich Gillet for Dollars 113m in a deal that
will close by the year-end.
The company's Packaging Corporation of America, boosted by rising prices for
its containerboard output, saw operating income jump 24 per cent, to Dollars
63m, from Dollars 51m last year. Sales improved to Dollars 562m, from
Dollars 513m.
For the first nine months of the year, Tenneco had net income of Dollars
376m, or Dollars 2.04 a share, on sales of Dollars 10bn, compared with
Dollars 256m, or Dollars 1.55, on sales of Dollars 9.8bn last year.
Tenneco's JI Case farm and construction equipment subsidiary saw
third-quarter operating income jump to Dollars 73m, from last year's Dollars
5m.
Tenneco sold 29 per cent of its stake in Case in a public offering in June.
Case, which reported earnings separately yesterday, said its third-quarter
net income was Dollars 29m, or 39 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 1bn.
Pro-forma comparative figures for the same 1993 quarter were Dollars 28m, or
38 cents, on sales of Dollars 841m.
For the first nine months of the year, Case had net income of Dollars 119m,
or Dollars 1.23 a share, on sales of Dollars 3.2bn, up sharply from last
year's Dollars 18m, or 19 cents, on sales of Dollars 2.9bn.

Tandem Computers reported record fourth-quarter revenues and earnings,
signalling a turnround after last year's restructuring.
Net income was Dollars 71m, or 62 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars
604.4m. This compares with net income of Dollars 3.2m, or 3 cents, on
revenues of Dollars 553.9m in the same period last year.
The performance reflected a strong return to growth, said Mr James Treybig,
president and chief executive. The company shipped a record number of
computers during the year, he said, and orders grew by 20 per cent in the
second half compared with the same period a year ago.
'These results validate our decisions last year to build and sell powerful
computers at much lower prices with open software products,' said Mr
Treybig. Like many computer companies, Tandem is making a transition from
proprietary technology to lower-priced 'open systems' products.
Shipments of mid-range computers grew 66 per cent, while sales of high-end
computers almost tripled over last year, and sales of Unix servers were up
42 per cent.
For the fiscal year, revenues were Dollars 2.1bn, up from Dollars 2.0bn. Net
income was Dollars 170.2, or Dollars 1.50 a share, including a one-time gain
of 20 cents a share from the sale of Applied Communications, a subsidiary.
This compares with a loss of Dollars 517.7m, or Dollars 4.61, for fiscal
1993, which included a Dollars 451m restructuring charge.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Chief executive quits at
Continental Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier, said that Mr Robert
Ferguson had resigned as chief executive and vice-chairman.
The move comes as the airline is struggling to correct operational problems
with its low-cost Continental Lite flights. The service, modelled on
Southwest Airlines' successful route system, was launched last year by Mr
Ferguson as part of a strategy to return Continental to profitability.
The airline said it was making progress on improving reliability, but
admitted that the service was still not breaking even.
Mr Ferguson's departure was announced as Continental revealed a 9 per cent
downturn in third-quarter operating income to Dollars 82.8m, from Dollars
91m in the 1993 quarter.
Revenues were down 6 per cent at Dollars 1.5bn. Fare-cutting during the
quarter was reflected in a 2.6 per cent decline in the average yield per
passenger mile.
However, net income more than doubled to Dollars 30.6m, or Dollars 1.03 a
share, against Dollars 12.4m, or 53 cents a year earlier. But the
improvement was mostly attributable to a Dollars 11.3m income tax provision
taken in the 1993 period.
Mr Gordon Bethune, the company's president, will assume overall direction of
both strategic and day-to-day operations. Mr Ferguson, 45, will stay on as a
director and consultant on overall strategic planning.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Premium on UBS shares slides
ahead of EGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The premium of the registered shares of Union Bank of Switzerland on its
bearer shares tumbled yesterday to 14.6 per cent from 19.4 per cent.
This is its lowest level since September 29, when the bank announced its
proposal to convert the registered shares into bearer shares, thereby
reducing their voting power.
UBS is fighting an attempt by Mr Martin Ebner, a maverick Zurich
broker-dealer, to swing a majority of votes at the annual general meeting
next April in favour of strategic changes at the bank.
An extraordinary general meeting will be held on November 22 to vote on the
share conversion proposal. If accepted, it would slash the voting power of
Mr Ebner's BK Vision, a fund with 18 per cent of the registered shares.
Yesterday, the bearer shares lost SFr5 to SFr1,230, but the registered
shares, which have one-fifth of the bearers' par value, tumbled SFr13 to
SFr282.
Some Swiss analysts said the premium slide indicated that investor sentiment
was moving towards UBS in the tense battle for proxies for the EGM.
'I have spoken to a number of large institutions, and it looks as if people
are convinced that Mr Ebner has no strategy, so it is better to take the 15
per cent premium than get nothing,' said Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss
equity research at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich.
Analysts said UBS had been lobbying investors, and there was a suspicion
that it has been supporting the premium to give registered shareholders an
opportunity to limit losses.
Other analysts said the premium was hurt yesterday by the publication by UBS
of the rules for registering shares before the EGM. New applications may be
accepted until November 17, but the bank reserves the right to reject
applications after October 25. This increased the uncertainty over what
could happen, an analyst said.

Jyske Bank, Denmark's fourth-largest bank, suffered a fall in pre-tax
earnings after nine months to DKr66m (Dollars 11.3m) from DKr495m last year,
writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The bank, the only Danish bank to publish quarterly results, said its core
earnings, which include net interest income and other operating income less
operating expenses, increased by 20 per cent to DKr855m.
But the pre-tax result was pulled down by unrealised losses on the bond and
share portfolio of DKr467m, compared with a gain DKr513m last year. The bank
expected to achieve its full-year profit target of between DKr200m and
DKr300m.

MacMillan Bloedel, the western Canadian forest-products group, benefited

Simon in Toronto. Earnings recovered to CDollars 58.1m (USDollars 43.30) or
44 cents a share, from a CDollars 20.7m loss, or 19 cents, a year earlier.
The latest figure includes an after-tax gain of CDollars 20.8m from the sale
of the Harmac pulp division. Sales advanced to CDollars 1.04bn from CDollars
828m.
Mr Bob Findlay, chief executive, said higher stumpage fees, rising labour
costs and the expense of implementing new, government-mandated environmental
practices contributed to increased costs in the British Columbia logging
operations.

Accelerating volume growth produced a record quarter at Procter &amp; Gamble,
the US consumer products group, with net earnings up 18 per cent to Dollars
792m on sales up 8 per cent at Dollars 8.2bn. Earnings in the US were up 12
per cent, and outside the US by 23 per cent.
Procter said unit volume worldwide in its first quarter had risen by 10 per
cent, or 7 per cent net of acquisitions. This compared with 5 per cent
growth for the previous fiscal year as a whole. US sales and volume both
rose 6 per cent.
Outside the US, volume rose 13 per cent but sales only 8 per cent.
Procter said the slower growth in international sales was partly due to
price competition, and was not significantly affected by currency movements.
The company attributed its better US earnings to its laundry and cleaning,
paper and food and drinks sectors. It said this was primarily due to volume
growth and cost control.
Earnings per share rose 18 per cent to Dollars 1.12. The shares continued
their stronger trend of the past two months, rising 1 1/8 to 62 1/4.

The figures come in the face of a 17 per cent increase in quarterly sales,
to Dollars 1.2bn, reflecting higher prices and demand for flat-rolled steel.
Bethlehem's results were held back by three projects, which added Dollars
60m to costs in the latest quarter: a rebuild of a coke oven, which is due
to come back into operation in December, a reline of one of the plant's two
blast furnaces and construction of a coal-injection facility for one of the
blast furnaces.
The company's structural products business, meanwhile, was hampered by
higher costs and weak demand. The company plans to phase out the loss-making
iron and steelmaking operations in this part of its business by next year.
At the pre-tax level, Bethlehem's profits were Dollars 11.3m, up from
Dollars 9.2m in the 1993 quarter, when it benefited from a tax credit. After
the payment of dividends on preferred stock, the company reported a
break-even position at the earnings per share level, compared with income of
22 cents a share a year ago.

Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group, yesterday confirmed that it had sold a
2 per cent stake in Petrofina, its Belgian counterpart, to Groupe Bruxelles
Lambert, the financial group headed by Mr Albert Frere writes John Ridding
in Paris.
The French company said the deal, done in an off-market transaction, was
part of its strategy of disposing of assets to reduce debts.
Mr Philippe Jaffre, Elf's chairman, has set a target of raising FFr5bn
(Dollars 940m) in 1994 through disposals.
Elf declined to specify the revenues relating to the sale. It now holds 2.3
per cent of Petrofina's voting shares.

United Technologies, the diversified US manufacturer, reported double-digit
profit increases in four of its five divisions in the third quarter, but
further profit falls in parts of its aerospace business.
Net earnings for the group were up 24 per cent at Dollars 194m, or Dollars
1.35 a share, and chief executive officer Mr George David said the company
was still on track to increase annual earnings by more than 30 per cent, or
by Dollars 1 a share.
The Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft engines division improved operating profits by
90 per cent to Dollars 110m, on a 4 per cent decline in sales.
The company said 'the benefits derived from aggressive restructuring and
cost reduction programmes, including lower research and development
spending, continue to offset weakness in the aerospace industry'.
However, profits from the flight systems division, which includes Hamilton
Standard flight controls and Sikorsky helicopters, were 37 per cent lower at
Dollars 57m, on sales down 14 per cent. The company said Hamilton reached
break-even in the quarter and was expected to be in profit for the rest of
the year.
Operating profit in the Otis lift business was up 11 per cent at a record
Dollars 111m.
The Carrier air conditioning and heating division increased profits by 11
per cent, to a record Dollars 127m, underpinned by strong demand in the US
and a recovery in Europe.
Profits in the automotive division were up 20 per cent at Dollars 31m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Boeing, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, yesterday reported
third-quarter earnings and sales virtually unchanged from a year ago.
The group blamed a fall in commercial aircraft deliveries, increased debt
expense and lower corporate investment income, which offset the positive
impact of a lower federal income tax rate.
Although Mr Frank Shrontz, chairman, forecast that commercial jet deliveries
this year would be slightly higher than forecast, at 265, he said that
year-end sales would still be about 15 per cent below 1993's total.
Mr Shrontz also warned that sales would remain at 'relatively low levels'
through next year, and until the global economic conditions and the
financial health of the world's airlines improved.
On a more upbeat note, however, the Boeing chairman said there were already
signs of an economic pick-up in Europe and Asia which, combined with the
sustained recovery in the US, augured well for the group's future.
He also said there was evidence that the main travel markets of the world
were also showing signs of recovery.
For the third quarter, Boeing's net income was Dollars 185m, or 54 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 189m, or 56 cents, in the same period of 1993.
Sales during the three months totalled Dollars 5.1bn, against Dollars 5.2bn
a year earlier.

Anheuser-Busch cemented its position as the top brewer in the US during the
third quarter, reporting record sales and profits as its Bud Light brand
became the country's second most popular beer after Budweiser, the company's
flagship brand.
With Bud Light's ascendance to the number two spot among all beers - it
overtook Miller Brewing's Miller Lite brand in the process - Anheuser-Busch
became the market leader in the regular, light and non-alcohol beer
categories.
This performance helped push the company's share of the domestic beer market
from 43.4 per cent to 44 per cent at the end of the quarter.
The St Louis-based brewer said beer sales to wholesalers and retailers rose
2.7 per cent during the quarter, boosted by the successful debut this year
of two new brands in the Budweiser family - Ice Draft and Ice Draft Light.
The introduction of new, derivative labels like 'ice' beer is part of an
attempt by leading brewers to compensate for the recent decline in the
market share of big-name brands.
Anheuser-Busch said overall sales climbed 3.9 per cent to Dollars 3.76bn,
which helped lift net income to a record Dollars 329m, or Dollars 1.24 a
share.
In the same quarter a year ago, the company recorded a net loss of Dollars
75m due to restructuring and tax-related charges.
Without the special items, third-quarter net income last year was Dollars
311m.

<TEXT>
Data General reported wider than expected losses for its fourth fiscal
quarter, but revenues increased as the minicomputer manufacturer continued
its difficult transition from proprietary computers to 'open' systems based
on industry standards.
Revenues for the quarter increased 5 per cent to Dollars 292.6m from Dollars
278.4m in the same period last year.
Net losses for the quarter were Dollars 6.2m, or 17 cents a share, compared
with last year's fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 37.2m, or Dollars 1.06, when
the company took a restructuring charge of Dollars 25m.
'The fact that our revenues are continuing to grow is encouraging,' said Mr
Ronald Skates, president and chief executive. Open systems products now
represent almost 90 per cent of total product revenues, he said. The company
has achieved improved operating results in each quarter this year, he noted.
The company said that it this week received a Dollars 53m payment from
Northrop Grumman in settlement of a copyright infringement suit. The gain
will be recorded in the current quarter.
'Looking forward, we are cautious for the short term. However, we believe
that our ability to continue to grow revenues, combined with aggressive
management of our cost structure, should result in achieving our goal of
returning to profitability,' said Mr Skates.
For the full year, Data General reported revenues of Dollars 1.12bn,
compared with Dollars 1.08bn in fiscal 1993 - the first year-on-year revenue
increase since 1991. Net loss for the year was Dollars 87.7m, or Dollars
2.45 a share, including a restructuring charge of Dollars 35m in the second
quarter.
In fiscal 1993, the company reported a net loss of Dollars 60.5m , or
Dollars 1.73 a share, which included a Dollars 25m restructuring charge.
Data General shares fell 75 cents to Dollars 9 3/4 in mid-session.

25m surplus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The continuing modest recovery in Europe's new car markets and further
cost-cutting and restructuring helped Ford achieve a Dollars 25m net profit
on its European automotive operations, excluding Jaguar, in the third
quarter.
This represented a sharp turnround on its Dollars 217m loss in the same
period of 1993 and continues a trend apparent since the beginning of this
year.
It followed a Dollars 310m turnround in the second quarter, when a net
profit of Dollars 244m was achieved compared with a net loss of Dollars 66m
in the same period a year ago.
The result lifts profit for the first nine months to Dollars 378m compared
with a Dollars 264m loss the previous year.
Until this year, Ford's European operations, excluding Jaguar, had suffered
three consecutive years of losses totalling Dollars 1.5bn.
'Europe is in the early stages of economic recovery and we expect to see
continued improvements in most (European) countries,' Mr Alex Trotman,
Ford's chairman, said yesterday.
Jaguar, Ford's UK-based luxury cars subsidiary, sharply reduced its loss in
the third quarter to Dollars 53m compared with a loss for the same period
last year of Dollars 108m, which included a Dollars 65m restructuring
charge.
This brought Jaguar's total deficit for the first three quarters to Dollars
155m compared with a Dollars 226m loss in 1993.
The parent group said the new generation of XJ saloons, which have just been
launched, are expected to accelerate Jaguar's recovery.
Ford expects Europe's total new car market to recover to 13.3m units this
year, up from 12.5m in 1993.
Its own car sales in the region in the first nine months of this year
reached 1,979,913, a 7.5 per cent rise on the year-ago level and commercial
vehicle sales were 3.5 per cent higher at 157,397.
Ford's share of Europe's car and commercial vehicles markets rose marginally
in the third quarter, to 12.7 per cent from 12.5 per cent in the year-ago
period.
Mr Trotman made clear that the financial recovery is expected to be
maintained next year as the market recovery continues and further
cost-cutting benefits accrue.
Capacity utilisation is expected to increase within the next three years
through the launch of a car smaller than the Fiesta, although so far no
decision had yet been made on a production location. It may receive a
further lift if the go-ahead is given for production of small cars to be
sold under the badge of Mazda, in which Ford has a 24.5 per cent stake.
A decision is expected before the end of November.

Banco Santander is heading for record profits this year afterthe Pta281bn
(Dollars 2.2bn) acquisition last April of Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto), the troubled bank whose board was sacked by the Bank of Spain
late last year.
Santander yesterday reported profits for the first nine months of Pta107bn
including Banesto, by far the highest result posted by a Spanish banking
group for this period. Without Banesto, Santander's pre-tax profits stood at
Pta100.5bn, 5.9 per cent up on the same period last year.
The consolidation of Banesto, formerly the fourth biggest Spanish bank,
raised Santander's average total assets to Pta16,827bn from Pta9,270bn,
outstripping those of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the next biggest domestic
banking group, by more than Pta4,000bn.
Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman, said the subsidiary bank's performance
over the past two months (Banesto was consolidated in August) had 'confirmed
the favourable forecasts of Banesto's future and vindicated a strategy
designed to consolidate a wide and solid client base in the Spanish market'.
Santander's return on equity stood at 19.58 per cent without Banesto and
19.73 per cent with Banesto's inclusion. The group's return on assets stood
at 1.01 per cent without Banesto and dropped marginally to 0.98 per cent
with it.

Brothers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Elaine Garzarelli, the Wall Street analyst who earned fame and fortune
after predicting the 1987 market crash, lost her job yesterday when Lehman
Brothers decided it could no longer afford her million-dollar salary.
The investment bank issued a terse statement saying that the 46-year old
analyst, who was director of sector analysis, had left to 'pursue other
opportunities'. However, sources close to Lehman said the bank had conducted
a review of Ms Garzarelli's job and concluded it was no longer
cost-effective to keep her.
Ms Garzarelli's departure from Lehman shocked Wall Street. There were no
indications that she had lost favour (although she recently issued a market
forecast that contradicted advice from Lehman's chief investment strategist)
and she remained highly regarded in the financial community.
Ms Garzarelli's views were not just followed on Wall Street. She was
familiar to millions of individual American investors through her many
television appearances, and was so well-known that she appeared in
advertisements last year for a brand of tights.
However, Ms Garzarelli was becoming a luxury Lehman could no longer afford.
In the latest quarter, earnings at the investment bank - which was spun off
from American Express in a stock market flotation last year - plunged 89 per
cent to Dollars 11m. It has since been cutting its payroll as part of a
cost-reduction strategy.
Although she has suffered some setbacks - her attempt to run an investment
fund was conspicuously unsuccessful - Ms Garzarelli is likely to receive
plenty of job offers.
Ms Joan Zimmerman of the Wall Street executive recruitment firm GZ Stephens
said: 'She has a tremendously strong public persona, and that persona can
translate into an ability to bring money into any organisation.'

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Recovery continues at Saab
Automobile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Saab Automobile, the Swedish carmaker, yesterday announced a SKr284m
(Dollars 39.4m) pre-tax profit for the first nine months and said it was on
course for its first full-year profit in six years.
The result represented a SKr1.34bn improvement on 1993's figures and
reflected cost-cutting, higher sales volumes and the weakness of the Swedish
krona.
The third-quarter profit of SKr144m was the group's second successive
quarterly surplus. It ended a five-year stretch of losses that dated back to
1989, when General Motors of the US became a joint owner in the company,
alongside Saab-Scania. In the third quarter of 1993 the group made a SKr369m
loss.
Saab's turnround was reflected in higher sales for the nine months, which
rose to SKr13.06bn from SKr11.47bn.
Retail sales jumped 24 per cent to 65,700 units from 52,800.
The success of the group's new 900 model, launched last year, has been the
most significant factor in the upturn. It accounted for 40,600 sales in the
nine-month period, compared with 25,100 for the older and bigger Saab 9000.
The company expects to sell about 92,000 cars in 1994, comfortably
surpassing last year's 73,600 and the break-even level of 83,000.
At one point the group hoped 1994 sales might climb as high as 95,000. A
shortage of convertible and 3-door 900 models, particularly in the important
US market, is the main reason it expects to fall short of this level.
US sales are expected to reach 23,000, compared with 18,000 last year.
The group's other improving markets include Sweden - where nine-month sales
rose to 12,300 from 7,000 - Taiwan, Australia and Italy.
The company said the weaker dollar would only have a limited impact on its
1994 figures, partly because of hedging.
Saab has swallowed more than SKr8bn in new capital from its owners and
accumulated losses of more than SKr11bn since General Motors became a
shareholder and took over management.
In 1993 the group made a SKr1.37bn loss.

   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ford Motor, the US's second biggest carmaker, reported record after-tax
profits for the third quarter. It was lifted by strong demand for new
vehicles in North America and a continuing recovery in its European
operations.
Mr David McCammon, treasurer, said Ford's sales and profits were likely to
grow for some time to come.
'Unless interest rates go way up, this recovery will be sustained for three,
four, five more years,' he said.
There was no sign that the rise so far seen in US interest rates had stunted
demand, he added.
Ford's results echo record earnings reported by Chrysler two weeks ago,
though General Motors, the biggest US car and truck maker, saw its recovery
falter during the three months to September.
Overall, Ford's after-tax profits jumped to Dollars 1.1bn, or 2 1/2 times
their level of a year ago. The biggest factor behind the increase was a
Dollars 245m improvement in profits from vehicle sales in North America,
which reached Dollars 529m. A 17 per cent increase in vehicle sales and
lower discounts offered to customers drove the improvement.
The North American results also reflected lower purchasing costs and the
fact that the company's advertising spending rose less rapidly than its
sales.
Leaving aside losses at Jaguar, Ford earned Dollars 25m in Europe - the
first time time that it has not reported a third-quarter loss for five
years. The summer period, with its model change-overs, is traditionally the
weakest period of the year for carmakers.
'In Europe, sales are still 1.5m (vehicles) a year below what we consider to
be normal - there's lots of improvement to come,' said Mr McCammon.
The company's results were lifted by record earnings in its financial
services business, which climbed 34 per cent, to Dollars 523m. This partly
reflected higher leasing and other financing earnings linked to the sale of
more vehicles. About 16 per cent of cars sold involved retail leases, while
37 per cent in all were financed by Ford's finance subsidiaries.
The financing business added Dollars 290 of profit for each vehicle Ford
sold in the US during the quarter, taking the total profit per vehicle to
Dollars 865.
Earnings of Dollars 1.04 a share, up from 40 cents a year ago, were recorded
on sales of Dollars 30.6bn, up from Dollars 24.5bn.

This was partly offset by a 5 per cent drop in earnings from its Conoco oil
subsidiary. However, net earnings before extraordinary items were up 86 per
cent at Dollars 680m.
The rise in chemical profits was driven by higher volumes and by reduced
fixed costs, the company said, with the two factors contributing equally.
However, selling prices had remained flat in spite of sharp volume
increases.
The rise in group earnings was helped by a sharp turnround in DuPont's
diversified businesses division, where profits jumped to Dollars 135m from
Dollars 6m. The company said this was due to the recovery in its coal mining
business, hit by strikes last year, and to better profits in agrochemicals
and medical products.
In DuPont's own narrowly defined chemicals division, earnings were up 126
per cent at Dollars 104m. Volume was up 9 per cent, made up of a 4 per cent
rise in the US and a 27 per cent rise in the rest of the world. Prices were
up 2 per cent.
In the polymers division, earnings were up 149 per cent at Dollars 177m.
Volume was up 15 per cent, made up of 11 per cent in the US and 21 per cent
elsewhere. Prices were 1 per cent lower. Earnings in the fibres division
were up 50 per cent at Dollars 164m. Volume was 6 per cent higher and prices
were static.
Oil earnings were down 5 per cent overall at Dollars 172m, made up of a 23
per cent drop in upstream earnings and a 22 per cent rise in downstream.
Upstream operations were hit by lower gas volume, lower crude oil volume in
the US and higher exploration costs. Downstream earnings were helped by
higher US margins in refined products and more turnover at refineries.
DuPont said that while chemicals prices were flat year on year, they were up
modestly from their low point in the second quarter.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Elkem improves to NKr198m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Elkem, the Norwegian light metals producer, reported a sharp rise in
nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr198m from NKr64m, helped by increased demand
for its main products.
However, the rebound in aluminium prices failed to benefit the group because
it had secured fixed-price, long-term contracts and forward hedging
agreements in 1993 under softer prices.
Primary aluminium prices shot up 40 per cent in 1994 and yesterday hit
Dollars 1,800 a tonne on the London Metals Exchange, thanks in part to
reductions in capacity utilisation by western producers which has
contributed to lower stocks and firmer demand.
At the end of last year, when LME aluminium prices were Dollars 1,125 a
tonne, Elkem signed contracts covering a large part of 1994 production, but
based on 1993 prices. Elkem would not disclose contractual arrangements for
1994 sales.
The company plans to cut aluminium output by 10,000 tonnes from the fourth
quarter and into 1995.
Elkem intends to seek board approval for a four-year NKr250m investment
programme for its Lista aluminium plant in Norway, for which annual capacity
will be upgraded by 10,000 tonnes.
Nine-month group operating profit rose to NKr333m from NKr282m but the
advance was stemmed by slightly weaker third-quarter operating profits.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander heads for peak
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Santander is heading for record profits this year after the Pta281bn
(Dollars 2.2bn) acquisition last April of Banco Espanol de Credito
(Banesto), the troubled bank whose board was sacked by the Bank of Spain
late late year.
Santander yesterday reported profits for the first nine months of Pta107bn
including Banesto, by far the highest result posted by a Spanish banking
group for this period. Without Banesto, Santander's pre-tax profits stood at
Pta100.5bn, 5.9 per cent up on the same period last year.
The consolidation of Banesto, formerly the fourth biggest Spanish bank,
raised Santander's average total assets to Pta16,827bn from Pta9,270bn,
outstripping those of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the next biggest domestic
banking group by more than Pta4,000bn.
Mr Emilio Botn, Santander chairman, said the subsidiary bank's performance
over the past two months (Banesto was consolidated in August, after the
completion of the acquisition) had 'confirmed the favourable forecasts of
Banesto's future and vindicated a strategy designed to consolidate a wide
and solid client base in the Spanish market'.
Santander's return on equity stood at 19.58 per cent without Banesto and
19.73 per cent with Banesto's inclusion. The group's return on assets stood
at 1.01 per cent without Banesto and dropped marginally to 0.98 per cent
with it.
Non-performing loans as a percentage of the group's total amounted to 6.37
per cent against 3.19 per cent if Banesto is not included in the
consolidated results. In spite of the higher figure resulting from Banesto's
inclusion, coverage stood at 79.14 per cent and at 100.61 per cent if real
guarantees are taken into account.
Santander posted a net interest margin of Pta220bn including Banesto.
Without Banesto, it was Pta188bn, up 6 per cent on last year's third-quarter
figure. Without Banesto, Santander raised its operating profit 10.8 per cent
to Pta118bn. Banesto's addition to the consolidated account lifted the
group's operating profit to Pta126bn.
The high totals posted by Santander came in spite of strong losses in
treasury operations. Income from fixed income and currency dealings fell to
Pta7.5bn for the nine months, including provisions of Pta13.5bn, from
Pta74bn in the first nine months of 1993.
The results indicated Banesto was earning money for Santander. It added just
over Pta9bn to the group's third-quarter net profits of Pta80bn although the
overwhelming proportion of this was provided by Banesto's 25 per cent stake
in Totta &amp; Acores the Portuguese bank.

FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Statoil rises on currency gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a sharp rise in
nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr12.85bn (Dollars 2bn) from NKr10.42bn in the
same period last year.
The rise followed unrealised currency gains as a result of the weak dollar
and came in spite of lower crude oil prices.
While there are uncertainties over future currency and oil price
developments, Statoil expects to achieve a substantial improvement in 1994
profits over 1993 when they hit NKr12bn before tax.
Group revenue rose NKr1.7bn to NKr61.42bn as operating profit increased
NKr700m to NKr10.7bn. Net profits shot up NKr900m to NKr3.8bn.
Net financial revenue rose steeply to NKr2.1bn from NKr374m as operating
costs increased NKr1.1bn to NKr45.7bn.
However, record crude oil production - 442,000 barrels a day versus 406,000
 -failed to offset the effect of low prices and cut the exploration and
production division's operating profit by NKr800m to NKr6.4bn.
Statoil said the E&amp;P division was likely to trim NKr2.3bn from planned
annual operational costs by the end of 1995.
In addition, the Mongstad refinery is well on the way to achieving planned
efficiency improvements of NKr375m annually. But the refining and marketing
division suffered weak margins with operating profit cut NKr52m to NKr288m.
Natural gas lifted operating profit NKr750m to NKr3.2bn, reflecting
increased gas volumes and firmer prices. Oil trading and shipping lifted
operating profit NKr121m to NKr553m, because of crude oil contracts secured
during favourable times in a fluctuating market.

The outcome, for the six months to June 30, reflected sharply higher profits

rents and interest.
Earnings per stock unit improved from 4.89p to 6.09p.
The associated El Oro Mining &amp; Exploration - also an investment dealing

Earnings per share were 0.42p (1.25p losses). The interim dividend is
reduced to 0.5p (0.75p) to reduce disparity.

<TEXT>
Time Products, the luxury watch and jewellery distributor, is selling
Stylecraft, its watch strap manufacturing business in Montreal, Canada.
However, the Pounds 600,000 sale will have a 'negligible effect' on the
profitability of a group that has in the pipeline a watch with a Pounds
500,000 price tag. Described as the 'most complicated pocket watch ever
made', it has 11 hands and movements on both sides.

Essex Furniture, the USM-quoted retailer and manufacturer, increased annual
pre-tax profits by 29 per cent from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 1.41m on sales
ahead 65 per cent to Pounds 17.7m.
The company attributed the progress in the year to June 30 to the success of
its new showrooms, combined with a significant comparable sales improvement
from existing outlets. The back order position at the year end was more than
Pounds 4m.
A final dividend of 2.5p makes a 4.3p (3.5p) total. Earnings were 8.05p

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Apollo launches rights to fund Aviation
Metals deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apollo Metals, the aluminium distributor and processor, is expanding into
specialised steels with the Pounds 8.55m cash purchase of Aviation Metals.
The acquisition is being financed by a rights issue - Apollo's second in two
years - underwritten by Granville Davies to raise a net Pounds 7.79m.
Aviation Metals is a private company specialising in sales of stainless
steel to the aerospace and defence industries. Despite depression in these
markets, it has raised turnover marginally over the last three years. Sales
during the year to July were Pounds 8.21m, giving pre-tax profits of Pounds
1.4m.
The rights issue of up to 11m shares is on a 3-for-5 basis at 77p;
preference shareholders are offered 24 ordinary shares for every 29
preference.
Apollo shares dipped 1p to 95p yesterday.
Apollo estimated pre-tax profits for the year to September would not be less
than Pounds 270,000, against Pounds 1.02m.
The group lapsed into a pre-tax loss of Pounds 219,000 during the first half
but said yesterday it was experiencing improvement in its trading
environment. It intends to pay a 2.4p final.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: New issues defy ailing image - The more
robust view from an FT survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just how sick is the new issues market? The recent spate of profit warnings,
share price slumps and executive departures would seem to indicate something
terminal.
However, a survey by the Financial Times reveals a far more robust picture.
In fact, more than half of the industrial and commercial companies which
have come to the market this year have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share
Index, while many of the underperformers have achieved parity or scored
better than their sector indices.
The survey covered 85 issues made since the start of January to the end of
September - excluding investment trusts, investment companies, demergers and
non-UK businesses. It shows the All-Share was outperformed by 0.8 per cent.
Thus for every high profile share price slide - such as Aerostructures
Hamble, down 74 per cent since issue; MDIS, down 60 per cent; Coda Group off
65 per cent; and DRS Data down 68 per cent - there have been several
over-achievers.
Shares in Waste Recycling Group, for example, have outperformed the market
by 47 per cent, Domnick Hunter Group by 41 per cent and Inspec Group by 40
per cent.
The performance of various newly quoted companies against their sector
indices is also revealing, with 58 per cent outperforming the field.
For example, construction group Amey Holdings only outperformed the
All-Share by 4 per cent, yet achieved a near 19 per cent score against the
FT-SE-A building and construction sector.
Likewise, Keller turned a deficit of 12.4 per cent into a gain against the
same index of nearly 7 per cent.
There is also a divide between the first four months of the year and the
latter period. Flotations since May have outperformed the All-Share by more
than 5 per cent (up to Monday's closing price). But those joining the market
in the previous four months - the index peaked at the end of January - have
underperformed by nearly 6 per cent.
This partly reflects the volatile market conditions, which have led to a
general decline since the start of the year.
'A big proportion of companies were coming to the market and being priced at
a time when optimism was high and the index was at a record,' says Mr Sandy
Muirhead, managing director at Charterhouse Tilney, the merchant bank.
Lower interest rates and investment trust sales in the last quarter of 1993
coincided with increased institutional demand for equity, in particular that
of smaller companies. There had also been a high number of management
buy-outs in the previous two to three years, and venture capitalists were
keen to exit.
'A huge arbitrage gap opened up at the time between floating and trade
sales,' said one corporate financier, 'and there were many eager takers'.
This meant that the supply of companies was swollen by those which under
different circumstances might not have floated - for instance
high-technology companies with a limited track record and high cash needs
because of research.
But institutional demand was soon exhausted by the flood of issues,
particularly against a backdrop of the falling equity market. About one
fifth of this year's floats have an electronic/high-tech background, sectors
which have been hardest hit by the downturn in the equity market.
'The lack of demand for stock from the institutions has had an exaggerated
effect on the shares for a number of new issues,' says Lord McGowan, head of
corporate finance at Panmure Gordon.
He adds that the situation has been made worse by the lack of liquidity
associated with some new issues, which often involve placing a relatively
small proportion of the shares.
Mr David Manning, director of UK equities at Legal &amp; General, says the
problem with this year's new issues has been one of numbers, rather than any
other sort of failing.
'The more new issues there are, the more the likelihood of some unsuitable
candidates coming to the market. Successfully-run MBOs do not alway make
successful PLCs - particularly where a single product, or single major
customer is involved.'
Mr Andrew Parry, head of UK equities at Barings, the UK fund management
group, is more critical. 'There were just too many issues and I think the
quality control on the corporate finance side slipped. There were quite a
lot of companies that should not have come to the market.'
But the corporate finance industry has been quick to reject recent
criticism. 'Any merchant bank knows that its reputation is at stake in
bringing a company to the market,' says Mr Muirhead.
'If the float goes badly, everyone suffers, not just the investor,' said one
financier. 'I don't believe for a moment there has been a lowering of
standards. The whole situation has been exaggerated because of the Hamble
shambles.'
Another corporate financier concluded: 'Some investors are feeling a bit
sore and are showing an unwillingness to participate in new issues. But
there are as many who are satisfied. These things go in cycles. A big
privatisation will probably settle things down.' In other words, a
comfortable profit would soon sweeten shareholders' memories.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: CentreGold at Pounds 4m and makes Pounds 5m
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES WHITTINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CentreGold, the electronic games publisher and distributor, yesterday
announced a 48 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits and the
acquisition of Core Design, an entertainment software publisher, for Pounds
5.34m.
The company, which was floated in October 1993, reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 4.03m (Pounds 2.72m) for the year to July 31. New product launch-es,
higher US sales and the growing popularity of personal computer software in
CD-Rom format helped the group to offset margin pressures.
Turnover advanced by 34 per cent to Pounds 91.3m (Pounds 68m). On the
publishing side, sales were up 62 per cent to Pounds 50.4m reflecting an
increase in compact disc-based products and the launch of the group's first
Nintendo video games.
Publishing sales in the US more than doubled, from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds
18.8m. Overseas sales accounted for 41 per cent (24 per cent) of divisional
turnover. Turnover in software distribution moved ahead by 11 per cent to
Pounds 40.9m.
Earnings per share increased to 7.3p (5.63p excluding new shares issued on
flotation). A final dividend of 1.6p makes a total of 2.4p.
Mr Geoff Brown, chief executive, said the acquisition of Core would help
consolidate the group's position in software development. It reported sales
of Pounds 4.74m last year.
Some Pounds 2.94m of the purchase price will be paid in cash, with the
balance in 2.74m shares issued to Mr Jeremy Smith, Core's managing director.
CentreGold shares, which were floated at 125p, gained 16p yesterday to close
at 105p. Mr Brown said that 'most investors still don't understand what we
do'.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Calluna coming to USM with Pounds 35m price
ticket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calluna, which designs and manufacturers miniature hard disk drives,
yesterday announced it would raise Pounds 10.3m in a placing on the Unlisted
Securities Market which will value the Scottish company at Pounds 35m.
Nearly 17m new shares are to be issued at 65p each, representing 32 per cent
of the enlarged share base.
Following the placing, the management's stake will fall from 39 to 28 per
cent, with the remainder being taken up by a variety of old and new
institutional investors.
Mr Norman White, managing director, said that neither the management nor
current investors in the three-year-old company would be taking any money
out. 'All the proceeds from the placing will be put back into the company in
order to fund our planned expansion,' he said.
The company's prospectus issued yesterday contained two pages of 'risk
factors' - highlighting the unpredictable nature of the computer component
market with regard to intellectual property rights, developing new products
and competition.
Calluna incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.69m for the 12 months to March
31 1994, compared with a Pounds 1.37m deficit for the 18 months to March
1993. The company made its first sales last year amounting to Pounds
301,000. Mr White said that he expected the company to make an operating
profit by the middle of next year.
The company manufactures high capacity 1.8 inch removable disk drives which
can be inserted into slots conforming to the PCMCIA industry standard in the
latest generation of personal computers. The drives enable users to increase
their storage capacity, move data and remove different sized amounts of data
from PCs for security reasons.
Calluna developed a revolutionary 1.8 inch hard disk drive, capable of
storing more than 80 megabytes of data. It also makes 130MB and 170MB drives
and will soon announce a 260MB product, all under the Callunacard name.
It points out that a recent industry report forecasts the number of
worldwide shipments of 1.8 inch hard disk drives will rise from 694,000 this
year to 20.6m in 1998.
Dealings in the shares start on October 31.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Seaperfect ready for market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seaperfect, the world's largest controlled producer of shellfish, is coming
to the market next month through a Pounds 27m placing and offer which will
value the scallop and clam farmer at about Pounds 60m.
The company, which was founded by an American computers entrepreneur,
yesterday published a pathfinder prospectus setting out its reasons for
coming to the UK market.
In it, Seaperfect forecasts that losses this year will not exceed Pounds 1m.
Last year the group incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.69m.
Mr Bill Lord-Butcher, the US-born chief executive, said flotation would give
Seaperfect the means to increase scallop and clam production 10-fold over
the next few years to meet rising demand. Currently the group processes some
two tonnes of shellfish a day.
It farms shellfish in Chile, Florida and South Carolina, producing seed in
its hatcheries and setting the young clams and scallops in protected coastal
areas. The process takes 17 and 30 months from seed to harvest for scallops
and clams respectively.
Mr Lord-Butcher argues that controlled production will become increasingly
important as wild shellfish stocks decline because of over-fishing,
pollution and poor reserve management. Wild catch, mostly from Japan and
China, still dominates the market for shellfish.
The company warns in its prospectus, however, that the business does come
with a certain degree of risk, in spite of the controlled production
processes. Where possible insurance had been taken out against factors such
as disease and pollution.
After the placing and offer directors will hold 21 per cent of the company
and new investors 44 per cent.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Rentokil Dollars 8m indoor plants buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rentokil, the environmental and property services group, has continued to
expand its tropical plants business, which supplies and maintains decorative
trees and indoor plants in commercial settings, via an Dollars 8m (Pounds
5m) acquisition.
Foliage Plant Systems operates a tropical plant rental and service business
in New Jersey and New York, with branches in Boston, Washington, Hartford
and Philadelphia.
It will be added to Rentokil's existing US tropical plants business, which
is the market leader. Last year it pushed sales up 35 per cent to Pounds
40.9m.
Foliage Plant Systems had sales of Dollars 7.6m last year. The consideration
is payable in cash, with Dollars 1.5 million deferred, subject to the
achievement of certain targets.
Rentokil moved into the plants business in 1986 when it bought Plants at
Work. More than 40 acquisitions later it claims market leadership in about a
dozen countries.
Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive, said he was very pleased with the
progress of Securiguard, the UK security group bought for Pounds 76m last
year. He intended to develop the security business in the UK, and perhaps in
the US.
Mr Thompson said the group was represented in all of the main developed
countries. He had no intention of entering new countries. The only possible
exception was Mexico, which seemed a suitable area for the core activities -
tropical plants, healthcare and pest control.
Rentokil yesterday also announced five small bolt-on acquisitions, although
the turnover and cash considerations involved came to less than Pounds 1m
for all five.
Two of the acquisitions were pest control companies - Commercial Pest
Elimination of Florida, and Servyrep in northern Spain. K&amp;L Hygiene
Services, in northern Germany, and Waterloo Services Company, based in
London, are both hygiene businesses. Allens Indoor Gardens of Brisbane will
be added to the group's tropical plants business in Australia.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BFI warns Attwoods investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Browning-Ferris Industries, the US waste group stalking Attwoods, yesterday
sought to steal a march on the UK company by urging investors to be wary of
promises made in fighting off the Pounds 364m cash bid.
The letter was sent to shareholders in advance of Attwoods' second defence
document, which is expected this week.
Attwoods is thought to be planning to publish projections on sales and
profits which would show expectations of a substantially improved
performance in 1995. The defence is expected to reinforce Attwoods' argument
that the offer is too low.
BFI said its own document 'reiterates that the group has not lived up to its
promises.'
Since 1992 operating margins and earnings per share had fallen, while debt
as a proportion of shareholders' funds had risen.
BFI quoted a series of statements made by Attwoods since 1992 to support its
claim that the group had consistently failed to deliver on promises of
improvements. 'Don't take any more chances,' BFI said. 'Don't gamble your
investment and risk further disappointment. We urge you to accept the BFI
offers.'
The statements chosen by BFI were excerpts from annual reports and newspaper
articles. Attwoods responded last night by saying that the quotes had
clearly been taken out of context. 'This is complete nonsense,' the company
said. 'No one ever disputed those three years would be difficult.'
Attwoods published its own excerpts from annual reports dating back to 1992,
indicating substantial uncertainty over trading conditions up to 1994.
However, Attwoods said it was grateful to BFI for reminding shareholders of
recent confident remarks for 1995. It would shortly outline the specific
factors which underlined that confidence.
BFI is offering shareholders 109p cash for Attwoods ordinary shares and 85p
per preference share.
At current exchange rates, BFI said this represented Dollars 9.20 per
American Depositary Receipt, equivalent to five ordinary shares.
BFI stressed that, if successful, it would pay the declared final net
dividend of 3.25p.
It is today expected to publish its full-year results showing profits for
the first time in its recycling business.
Meanwhile, Fidelity Investments yesterday disclosed that it had sold
virtually all of its preference shares to Salomon Brothers, the US
investment bank.

Butte Mining's audited results for the year to June 30 showed pre-tax losses
of Pounds 351,000, giving losses per share of 0.15p. The preliminary
announcement gave pre-tax losses of Pounds 436,000.
The improvement comes as a result of the company writing back certain

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Olives Property, the property investment and development company, reported
pre-tax profits of Pounds 224,404 on turnover of Pounds 753,558 for the six
months to June 30.
The outcome compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 720,392 on turnover of
Pounds 1.34m last time, although that was bolstered by exceptional income of
Pounds 812,952 relating to settlement of a legal dispute.
Earnings per share came out at 0.46p (4.2p).
Rental income was running at Pounds 1.86m a year, said Mr Tony Grant,
chairman and joint chief executive, and the company was now achieving
sufficient revenue to cover ongoing overheads.
Net assets increased from Pounds 5.51m to Pounds 15.5m, principally because
of the rights issue associated with the acquisition of Huby Estates, which
raised a net Pounds 9.79m.
A capital reorganisation has been approved by the High Court and the
cancellation of the capital redemption reserve and part of the share premium
account had been effected. The board intends to recommend payment of a final
dividend in respect of 1994.

Nicholas and Robert Barr, the brothers who lead the rebel shareholders at
Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, yesterday named a chairman designate to replace
their uncle on the board of the leisure and motor distribution group.
The brothers, who claim majority support among ordinary - voting -
shareholders, announced that Sir David Rowe-Ham would be their candidate as
chairman in place of Mr Malcolm Barr.
Sir David, a former Lord Mayor of London, is a non-executive director of
Williams Holdings and Apta Healthcare.
The brothers, who have called an EGM to unseat the group's present chief
executive and finance director, also appointed NM Rothschild as their
financial advisers.
They plan to run the company's two core divisions as stand-alone businesses,
and enfranchise the non-voting A shares, owned almost entirely by
institutions.
The board has called another EGM to discuss its own plans for enfranchising
the A shares. A document is expected imminently.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BM cuts deficit to Pounds 71.5m and
proposes name change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM Group, the engineering company, yesterday reported a 75 per cent
reduction in bank borrowings and a name change alongside its results for the
year to the end of June.
The group, which almost collapsed last year, sold 17 businesses and 14
properties to reduce its borrowings from Pounds 160m to Pounds 40m at
September 30.
Announcing new banking arrangements, the group also broke with its past by
proposing to change its name to Brunel Holdings.
'Effectively, we are at the end of a massive and costly restructuring of the
group,' said Mr Cliff Walker, chief executive. 'The announcement of new
banking facilities, the bulk of which are on a three-year term, enables us
from now on to focus all our management concentration on the development of
our ongoing businesses.'
Pre-tax losses were reduced from Pounds 117m to Pounds 71.5m. The deficit
was struck after Pounds 67.5m of exceptionals, which included a Pounds 51.6m
goodwill write-off and Pounds 12.7m pension prepayment write-off, both
relating to the disposal programme.
At the operating level the company reported profits of Pounds 6.73m for the
year against losses of Pounds 1.23m on sales of Pounds 403m, down from
Pounds 547.2m. But interest costs still amounted to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds
14.1m).
The company also announced recommended offers to acquire all the preference
shares of Blackwood Hodge, the construction equipment distributor, for 6.57m
new BM ordinary shares, with a market value of Pounds 2.95m at last night's
close.
BM, which already owns the entire ordinary share capital of Blackwood Hodge,
intends to liquidate the company.
The Pounds 60m acquisition of Blackwood Hodge in 1990 was largely blamed for
the difficulties which led BM to breach its covenants on interest cover and
net assets last year. The company is still considering litigation against
Hambros, the merchant bank which advised on the purchase.
Blackwood Hodge reported reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.12m (Pounds
44.2m) for the year to June 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 267.7m to Pounds
235.6m after disposals including its lossmaking Canadian operations. BM has
sold virtually all of the Blackwood Hodge businesses.
BM is concentrating on its process engineering businesses, including skid
steer loaders, fasteners and woodworking machinery. More than 50 per cent of
its sales are to customers outside the UK.
Mr Moger Woolley, chairman, said BM would return to normal preference
dividend payments this year, including arrears for the year to June 30. He
also announced its intention to return 'as soon as possible' to the payment
of ordinary dividends, which were last paid at the interim stage in 1992-93.
Losses per share declined from 109.1p to 63.4p. The shares rose  1/2 p to
45p yesterday.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit to acquire Superdrive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kwik-Fit Holdings, the Edinburgh-based tyres, exhausts and brakes fitter,
has agreed to buy the Superdrive chain of 125 tyre and exhaust centres from
Shell UK.
The deal, worth Pounds 21.5m, will increase Kwik-Fit's number of outlets to
almost 800 and boost its presence in the south of England, where it has been
under-represented.
The Superdrive chain, launched in 1982, made operating losses of Pounds 3.4m
on sales of Pounds 41.7m last year. Shell said it had decided to sell in
order to focus on its core oil businesses.
Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive of Kwik-Fit, estimated that it
would take six to nine months to overhaul the Superdrive outlets, although
they would benefit immediately from a less onerous cost structure.
He said: 'The combination of Superdrive and Kwik-Fit gives us a tremendous
opportunity to create an even stronger group, attract more customers and
increase income.'
Kwik-Fit has paid Pounds 9.5m in cash from its own resources for the chain
and will assume Pounds 12m of debt on completion.
The Superdrive fast-fit outlets are located in the Midlands, London and the
south of England, supplying and fitting motor vehicle parts including
exhausts, tyres, brakes, vehicle servicing and MOT testing.
A particular attraction of Superdrive was that it offered sites in southern
towns such as Tunbridge Wells and Windsor, where there were significant
planning obstacles to entry.
Mr Farmer said that consolidating the two chains would probably lead to the
closure of about 25 outlets, although in some cases of overlap the new
Superdrive outlet would be preferred to the existing Kwik-Fit site. He was
keeping an open mind about the future of Superdrive's MOT testing
operations, which Kwik-Fit does not currently offer.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: After-care service of a quick sell - The
industry's response to the mis-selling of pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As estimates of the total bill facing the life insurance industry to
compensate victims of poor advice to take personal pensions soar to Pounds
2bn, life companies are having to review their sums as well as their
individual cases.
Almost all life insurers have made some provision for possible pension
compensation in their accounts for 1993, on the basis of how bad the extent
of mis-selling looked last year.
In its role as prudential supervisor, the Department of Trade and Industry
wrote to life companies in January to check what provisions they had made.
Now it is repeating the exercise, as the potential liability has grown
sharply.
The original cause for concern last December was a pilot study by KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountancy firm, suggesting that in nine out of 10 cases sales
of personal pensions to people transferring a lump sum from an occupational
scheme did not meet regulators' standards.
Life companies emphasised that in many cases the advice would have been good
though the record-keeping was poor, and played down the cost of compensating
cases where a pension had been mis-sold.
Now there seem to be two areas of business which were not previously thought
to be a significant problem.
Life insurers thought the number of cases where someone took a personal
pension and left an employer's scheme to do so was relatively small, since
there would clearly be a disadvantage to the investor in giving up the
employer's contribution. They did not know how many had bought a private
plan instead of joining an employer's scheme.
A survey by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow for the Securities and Investments
Board, the City's chief regulator, suggests about 300,000 people were
advised to opt out of an occupational scheme and about 500,000 were advised
not to join.
Advice to take either course is more likely to have been poor than advice to
take a pension transfer, and the cost of redress is likely to be higher.
Identifying victims of mis-selling here will itself be an expensive task for
life companies.
There was little quarrelling from life companies yesterday about the
prospect that they would have to make more provisions in the light of the
new information. Only Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, maintained
that it did not need to make specific provision.
Insurers emphasised, however, that the amounts of compensation likely to be
payable by most companies were 'small change' in relation to their assets,
and might have even less effect on policyholders and shareholders than poor
investment performance or volatility in the markets.
Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's largest life insurers, was the first to
acknowledge it would have to raise provisions to take account of
administrative costs and the prospect of contributing - through the
Investors' Compensation Scheme - to redress for the clients of independent
financial advisers which had gone out of business.
Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, the largest organisation to act as an
independent adviser, said that having provided Pounds 5m already, it would
be setting aside a further Pounds 5m.
Others, however, took a different view. Pearl Assurance, for example, said
it expected provisions to be 'a bit higher, but nothing like twice as much'.
Similarly at BAT, which owns Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, the expectation
was that provisions would have to increase only slightly. Its earlier
estimate for provisions across the two companies had been about Pounds 10m.
It acknowledged, however, that it was in a somewhat unusual position because
Allied Dunbar had professional indemnity insurance at Lloyd's, and the
insurers had already been notified of a potential claim.
The greatest concern seemed to be the unknown factors which could ultimately
affect the amounts they would have to pay through the ICS.
Mr Chris Brocksom, chief executive of AXA Equity &amp; Law, said that in making
provisions last year it had taken little account of what it might have to
pay for compensating clients of independent advisers no longer in business.
Both he and Mr Philip Scott, life and pensions general manager at Norwich
Union, highlighted how little information there was here. First, no one
knows how many independent advisers will go out of business and so require
the ICS to come into play. Second, it has not yet been decided how that ICS
bill should be divided between life companies.
For the year to March 31, it will be allocated on the current basis for
sharing out the cost of compensation across the retail financial services
sector. But most claims will come later and no arrangement has been made for
how the bill should be divided then. Companies which do most business
through independent advisers might have to pay more.
With so much unresolved, the DTI letters may reach life companies this week
but they are unlikely to get definite answers for many months to come.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Churchill China raises just Pounds 7.5m in
placing at 280p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Churchill China yesterday became the third Staffordshire-based china company
to float this year - but the state of the new issues market sharply curbed
its ambitions of just three weeks ago.
At the time of the pathfinder prospectus on October 5 the company was aiming
to raise Pounds 15m through a placing. Yesterday Hoare Govett placed a total
of 2.68m ordinary shares, fully underwritten, raising just Pounds 7.5m.
Mr Peter Siddall, chairman, described the new issues market as 'not very
receptive. We took the view that we had got this far, and we wanted to go
ahead.'
The shares were priced at 280p to give Churchill a capitalisation of Pounds
29.7m. Earnings are forecast at 25.4p, giving a prospective multiple of 11.
Mr Siddall said that when the flotation process was started, the company had
been looking at a 'significantly higher' multiple.
Of the shares issued, only 1.25m are new, with the remainder being sold by
the Roper family that controls the company. There are three Roper brothers
on the board, and together with their families and family trusts, they
continue to hold the bulk of the 10.62m shares in issue following the
placing.
The family, which was planning to sell Pounds 10m worth of shares, has sold
just Pounds 4m.
New money for the company, net of expenses, is Pounds 2.9m. This compares
with the Pounds 5m originally expected to help pay for an investment
programme to improve capacity and quality.
Mr Siddall said yesterday that the company would press ahead with the
programme, although the reduction in money raised might lead to some
rescheduling.
Churchill is forecasting pre-tax profits, before bonuses to directors, of
not less than Pounds 3.6m for 1994. This compares with last year's Pounds
2.9m, struck on turnover of Pounds 36m.
The notional dividend is 9.86p, giving a notional yield of 4.4 per cent.
Dealings begin next Tuesday.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: New owner seeks to revitalise Sock Shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sock Shop, the 1980s retailing phenomenon which collapsed four years ago,
could come back to the market following its sale yesterday to Sheffield
entrepreneur Mr Stephen Hinchliffe.
Mr Hinchliffe has spent the two years since his abrupt departure from quoted
companies James Wilkes and Lynx Holdings building up a group of retail
businesses.
In August his latest company, Salisbury Stores, acquired the lossmaking
Salisbury luggage chain from Signet, the jewellery group formerly known as
Ratners, for Pounds 3.18m.
Salisbury Stores is buying Sock Shop from Murray Johnstone, the Scottish
financial group, in return for a convertible equity stake believed to be
about 10 per cent. The purchase will create a private retailing group with
sales of more than Pounds 100m.
Mr Hinchliffe said Salisbury aimed to come to the market in about two or
three years when 'market conditions are right and when our performance is
good enough to give some credibility'.
Sock Shop is believed to be breaking even on sales of about Pounds 30m. It
collapsed three years after flotation following an ill-fated expansion into
the US. It was bought by a management team backed by Murray Johnstone, which
eventually controlled the group.
Mr David MacLellan of Murray Johnstone will join the Salisbury Stores board.
Mr Hinchliffe said he expected to broaden the products on offer at Sock
Shop, introducing accessories and gifts. The enlarged business would enjoy
'significant merger benefits, including cross-fertilising merchandise', he
said.
In September Mr Hinchliffe separately acquired the Colibri cigarette
lighters business.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK biotechnology pioneer Porton sold for Pounds 65.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Porton International, one of Britain's first biotechnology companies,
yesterday closed the chapter on a history dogged by failure to deliver
promised profits and blockbuster products by agreeing to sell its business
for Pounds 65.5m.
The private group, founded in 1983 by Mr Wensley Haydon-Baillie - a
reclusive multi-millionaire - has recommended an offer by Beaufour Ipsen,
the family-owned French pharmaceutical company. As part of the deal, worth
Pounds 13.40 a share in cash or loan notes, Mr Haydon-Baillie stands to
receive more than Pounds 20m on his 33 per cent holding in the company.
Since he stepped down as chairman two years ago, the group has sold off
non-core businesses and concentrated on manufacturing pharmaceutical
products.
Saying that the company had turned over a new leaf, Mr Tony Gover -
executive vice-chairman and a long-time associate of Mr Haydon-Baillie -
said the past problems had been caused by 'one or two products which did not
come to fruition'.
During the 1980s, institutions invested Pounds 76m in the group following
company forecasts that its products would generate profits of Pounds 140.6m
by 1990. In the event, its main anti-herpes medication proved ineffective
and profits fell well short of targets.
At the same time, the company spent large sums on opulent offices and
executive salaries.
It also earned a reputation for excessive secrecy, with Mr Haydon-Baillie
employing a former member of the crack Special Air Service as a personal
security adviser. Political concerns, meanwhile, were aroused when MPs
demanded to know why the government signed a deal with Porton allowing it to
develop commercial uses for ideas pioneered at the state-owned Centre for
Applied Microbiology and Research (CAMR).
While not commenting on Porton's past problems, Lazard Brothers, Beaufour
Ipsen's financial advisers, said: 'This is a company on a significant
recovery trend.'
In the first half of this year, it reversed earlier losses with
pre-exceptional profits of Pounds 1.85m on turnover of Pounds 25.6m. The
deal, financed with Pounds 58.3m of borrowings and Pounds 7.2m of
shareholder equity, offers Beaufour Ipsen manufacturing and distribution
facilities in Britain and the US.
Porton's existing senior management and staff will continue run the business
as part of Speywood Holdings, a new subsidiary set up by Beaufour Ipsen.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Prudential pension sales suffer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK sales of life and pensions policies by Prudential Corporation, the UK's
largest life insurer, fell in the first nine months of this year, with a 30
per cent fall in sales of single premium individual pensions.
Figure for Prudential's new business published yesterday, showed generally
subdued sales of regular and single premium products, but sales of the more
flexible products introduced by Prudential in the summer were more
encouraging.
This is the first time Prudential has released new business figures on a
quarterly basis.
Individual pension sales were particularly depressed, reflecting public
concern about the standards of selling in the sector.  This was sparked by a
report late last year suggesting that nine out of 10 cases where an investor
was transferring a lump sum into a personal plan did not meet regulators'
standards.
Concern is likely to be intensified after a regulator's report earlier this
week suggesting that hundreds of thousands of people may have been wrongly
advised to take personal pensions and leave, or not to join, their
employers' schemes.
Sales of annual premium individual pensions fell 6 per cent to Pounds 88m,
while single premium pension sales fell 30 per cent to Pounds 211m, during
the nine months. Within that total, pension transfer sales dived to Pounds
151m from Pounds 286m.
The division of the insurance and savings elements of a conventional life
insurance product - into Prudence Family Cover and the Prudence Savings
Account - appeared to be paying off. The savings account attracted some
Pounds 13m of annual premiums and some Pounds 72m in single premiums.
Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, said UK sales were 'holding up well in a
problematic market'. He noted advances in Pacific operations. New business
in Hong Kong and Singapore rose with higher sales of regular and single
premium products.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Sweden's Securum to seek Pounds 1.73bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Securum, the Swedish state-owned company set up to liquidate Nordbanken's
bad loans, yesterday launched a SKr20bn (Pounds 1.73bn) refinancing in the
international capital markets in one of the country's biggest non-government
debt issues.
The funds will be used to repay most of the loans Securum received from
Nordbanken, the biggest casualty of Sweden's banking crisis, when it took
over SKr67bn worth of sour credits at the start of 1993.
The move allows Securum to widen its borrowing base and assists government
efforts to privatise Nordbanken by reducing the bank's uncomfortably large
exposure to a single client. Privatisation is expected to take place next
year, but awaits a formal go-ahead from the new Social Democratic
government.
Mr Anders Nyren, Securum's chief financial officer, said the company wanted
to 'position itself in the international markets for future business
transactions.' He stressed there would only be 'a very marginal' increase in
the company's funding costs, even though the loans from Nordbanken were
granted on a 'cost of funds' basis.
Nordbanken will remain Securum's single largest creditor, but outstanding
loans are expected to fall to between SKr5bn and SKr10bn from nearly
SKr23bn.
There are two tranches, both backed by the Swedish government. Under the
international one, Chemical Bank and Enskilda Corporate will arrange a
Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 857m) five-year syndicated term loan. Terms will be
Libor plus 25 basis points. Enskilda Corporate and Nordbanken will arrange a
SKr10bn domestic financing programme to run over 10 years, to be split
between a SKr5bn subordinated term loan and a SKr5bn subordinated private
placement.
Securum made a SKr6.3bn profit in the first six months of 1994. It has moved
from being a finance company to an investment and property holding group. It
has a SKr21bn European asset portfolio outside Sweden and believes its
development will benefit from contacts with leading international banks. It
plans to list many of its industrial and property operations. The aim is to
return at least SKr10bn of its SKr24bn initial equity to the state by the
time its assets are liquidated.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Woolwich takes own path by lifting life unit stake to 90%:
Changes in the insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest, has moved to take
decisive control of its joint venture life insurance subsidiary, of which
Sun Alliance was the other shareholder.
At the first opportunity for review of the arrangements for the company,
Woolwich has increased its stake from 51 per cent to 90 per cent. The
current arrangements are also likely to be reviewed at some point.
The move is part of the unravelling of links between life companies and
building societies, as societies want to take fuller advantage of the
powerful distribution opportunities in selling to their large numbers of
customers and making use of their extensive branch networks.
Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, and Nationwide Building Society,
the second largest, have already announced plans to set up their own
wholly-owned life subsidiaries, ending the arrangements by which they sold
policies only of Standard Life and Guardian Royal Exchange respectively.
Of the ten largest societies, only Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest,
and Northern Rock, the tenth largest, are still in 'tied' relationships with
life companies without having announced plans to end them.
Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, said the society felt the
broadly equal shares in the subsidiary did not now properly reflect the
importance of the distribution capability.
The move will give Woolwich greater freedom and flexibility in deciding what
new areas of life insurance it might want to develop. The disadvantage of
getting income just from selling life insurance policies rather than from
creating them as well is likely to be exacerbated next year when a new
regulatory regime will require customers to be told the costs of selling
life products. This is expected to put pressure on commission levels.
Woolwich Life was set up in October 1990 with share capital of Pounds 30m.
Sun Alliance has been paid about Pounds 25m for its stake and still has the
contract to carry out administration for the company. Sun Alliance said the
original arrangement had been a a successful enterprise, and had produced
investment returns of more than 20 per cent a year to the shareholders. The
10 per cent stake it retained remained a good investment, it said. In 1993,
Woolwich Life won Pounds 16.3m new regular premium business, and Pounds
54.2m single premium business. It had 86,000 policies in force at the end of
the year.

FT  27 OCT 94 / France lights matchfor tobacco sell-off: David Buchan sees
Seita stubbing out foreign hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government yesterday lit the match for an eventual sale of Seita,
the French state tobacco company - but privatisation of the 183-year-old
concern may, like one of its own Gauloise cigarettes, be a slow burn.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday he was opening
the tendering for French and foreign banks to advise the government on the
sale of Seita, which has already chosen Credit Commercial de France and
Societe Generale to advise it.
Seita has thrown cold water on the enthusiasm of the world's tobacco giants
by saying it wanted 'no foreign tobacco maker' to take a stake.
It confirmed that it would like the state to keep nearly 10 per cent of its
100 per cent stake, leave about the same for its employees, and award 25-30
per cent to a core group of stable shareholders who might include foreign
institutions.
Foreign tobacco groups would otherwise be keen to take a stake in a Seita,
which distributes other companies' cigarettes and has the added cashflow
bonus of being a collector of taxes. In particular, BAT Industries, the
UK-based tobacco conglomerate, appeared to see its 1993 'financial'
investment in the Banque Nationale de Paris privatisation as smoothing its
path politically to an 'industrial' investment in Seita.
The decision to keep foreign manufacturers out is not just because Seita
considers itself, with its Gauloises, Gitanes, its Alain Delon brand of
cigarette and its Johnny Hallyday lighter, as much part of the French
heritage as camembert cheese.
With privatisation, Seita will lose its legal monopoly on tobacco
manufacture in France, a right that has become meaningless with the free
entry into France of cigarettes made in other European countries. But it
intends to keep its de facto monopoly on distribution of cigarettes in
France to the country's 36,500 tabacs, or tobacconists.
Allowing foreign cigarette makers into its capital would jeopardise the
neutrality of its distribution system, says Seita, while adding nothing in
terms of external expansion. Seita already has production and marketing
agreements with BAT in Germany, with Reemstma of Germany in several markets
in western Europe and now in eastern Europe, and with Japan Tobacco in
Japan.
But Philip Morris, the US tobacco giant, recently threatened to break its
distribution agreement with Seita if the latter took in another foreign
tobacco company as a shareholder. Seita denies ceding under such pressure,
but some industry analysts believe that Philip Morris, which has 29 per cent
of the French market (behind Seita's 45 per cent), could have carried out
its threat.
Distribution is certainly a money-spinner for Seita, whose profits rose from
FFr447m in 1992 to FFr585m (Pounds 70m) last year on turnover that increased
from FFr13.9bn to FFr14.1bn.
Seita also collects the 75 per cent rate of state tax levied on total
tobacco sales - FFr63bn last year - passing it on to the state with a two to
three-week delay.
The privilege of playing with the taxpayer's money for that period accounted
for FFr200m of Seita's profit last year.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Stanhope to show positive assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stanhope, the property development company which is in last-ditch
refinancing negotiations with its banks, is expected to return to positive
net assets when it announces full-year results.
Such a result would strengthen the company's position as it searches for a
partner willing to inject up to Pounds 100m of equity on terms that will
satisfy banks owed Pounds 140m.
A refinancing must be agreed if its syndicate of 16 lending banks, led by
Barclays, are to extend credit lines beyond December 19.
Stanhope's main assets are held in its 50 per cent stake in Broadgate
Properties, which owns much of the Broadgate and Ludgate office developments
in the City of London.
Broadgate Properties' results, which are due to be published today, are
expected to show a rise in net assets, including loans from shareholders, to
more than Pounds 230m, from Pounds 148m last year.
Analysts estimated yesterday that this would be enough to lift Stanhope into
a position of positive net assets, even though some of its investments -
notably its joint venture development with Trafalgar House in Chiswick - may
have fallen in value.
Last published figures showed that Stanhope had negative net assets of
Pounds 15.7m at June 30 1993.
While a large rise in the value of Broadgate would be encouraging for
Stanhope, Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive, is still searching for an
investor willing to make the necessary cash injection.
Earlier this month the company issued a statement which said that potential
rescuers were unlikely to match the prevailing 29p share price. Yesterday
the shares closed at 12p.
British Land, the investment company run by Mr John Ritblat which bought a
29.9 per cent stake in Stanhope in February, has made no secret of its
willingness to step in.
But Mr Ritblat's main interest is acquiring Broadgate, which Stanhope is
reluctant to sell while the property market is moving in its favour.
A forecast commissioned by Stanhope from Jones Lang Wootton, the surveyors,
suggested that Broadgate Properties' assets could be worth anything up to
Pounds 1.3bn in three years time, against an estimated Pounds 1bn today.
If the banks believe such figures they may agree that selling 50 per cent of
Broadgate now would not be the best way of realising value from one of the
City's best office developments.
Others understood to be interested in investing in Stanhope on the right
terms include Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which both run substantial
property funds.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Cabinet set to back bill to deregulate gas supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government appears set to introduce a bill to deregulate the domestic
gas market in the next parliamentary session after Mr Tim Eggar, energy
minister, yesterday outlined proposals for a pilot scheme in 1996 and full
competition in 1998.
Although Mr Eggar said he could not confirm the inclusion of legislation in
the Queen's Speech next month, his remarks left little doubt that he
believes the Cabinet will support tabling the bill.
Asked by an MP in a select committee meeting if the deregulation plan could
go ahead without a bill next session, he replied: 'Theoretically yes, but
you need a lot of theory and not a lot of practice to reach that
conclusion.'
A likely decision to go ahead with deregulation is supported by a growing
consensus that competition would be beneficial.
Independent gas suppliers have predicted that prices could fall by 10 per
cent with deregulation. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, gas industry regulator, told
MPs at the trade and industry select committee yesterday that anyone who
paid their bill on time in the new regime was likely to be a winner in price
terms.
Separately, British Gas said it is likely to raise its prices, including
standing charges, by about the rate of inflation at the end of the year.
There had been speculation that the standing charge of less than Pounds 37
would be raised to Pounds 42.
The company promises discounts for consumers who pay by direct debit and
hopes to double the number of people on such schemes, from the 3m at
present.
Confirming plans for more cost-reflective pricing, Mr Richard Giordano,
chairman, said there would also be a change next year to reflect
transportation charges. This could increase or decrease prices in some areas
by 2 per cent.
Mr Eggar told MPs that competition would start with a regional pilot,
'perhaps in an area the size of a county with 500,000 people', in April
1996. A second pilot involving about 2m people would follow in 1997.
He hoped to encourage small suppliers into the market, suggesting for
example that coal-bed methane gas could be provided to individual villages.
He said legislation would also include provision for a levy on gas suppliers
to address potential problems if individual suppliers picked up an
'unreasonable' percentage of customers who were expensive to serve.
Ms Spottiswoode said a review of British Gas operations in December will
investigate claims by independent suppliers that transportation and storage
have been overvalued by Pounds 3bn.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Court orders France to open up two air routes: Paris fails
to delay Brussels monopoly ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, JOHN RIDDING and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice yesterday ordered the French government to
open up to competition immediately two of the country's busiest and most
lucrative internal air routes, ending the monopoly of Air Inter, the
domestic partner of Air France.
The decision is the second defeat in five months for the French government,
which has been attempting to delay liberalising its domestic air transport
market while it seeks to restructure its loss-making flag carrier.
Last night the government was still seeking to avoid the immediate opening
of the routes. Instead, it said it would open them from January next year.
France was forced in June to allow British carriers to fly to Orly airport
in the south of Paris after a confrontation with the British government and
the European Commission.
After losing the 'Battle of Orly', it appealed to the European Court against
another Brussels ruling ordering it to open up the Orly-Marseilles and
Orly-Toulouse routes by October 27.
But the court rejected the French request to delay liberalising the two
profitable routes until later next year and said France 'must open the lines
. . . and take the necessary measures to allow this decision to take effect
on October 27'.
The French reaction could set Paris on a collision course with Brussels over
EU air transport liberalisation policy.
Mr Marcelino Oreja, the European Union transport commissioner, called on
France yesterday to comply fully with the court ruling. Mr Oreja is
understood to be adamant that France cannot delay opening up landing rights
until January. 'The EU is a community of equal rights and obligations before
the law,' said one Brussels official.
Member states and airlines committed to liberalisation are also angry at the
Commission's decision to allow the French government to grant FFr20bn
(Pounds 2.4bn) in fresh subsidies to Air France, as well as approving state
aid to Olympic Airways of Greece and TAP Air Portugal. The British
government and seven European airlines filed actions in the European Court
this month seeking to annul the EU approval for the Air France state aid.
The French Transport Ministry said it was committed to 'gradual and managed
liberalisation' on domestic routes.
In its appeal to the European Court, it had argued that the introduction of
competition on the two routes would result in a sharp loss in market share
for Air Inter.

Citibank still has some work to do on its scheme for allowing Lloyd's Names
to convert to limited liability status. But it is the sort of arrangement
that should appeal to many existing Names. Those hardened gamblers looking
to get the most out of the market's recovery may want to retain their
unlimited liability. This enables them to write business representing up to
five times the funds lodged with Lloyd's. The Citibank scheme will offer
gearing of only 2:1 though it may be possible to increase it to 3:1 through
the use of a reinsurance contract. But such returns may well be attractive
enough for existing Names who are no longer prepared to put their last
collar stud at risk.
Similar schemes are less likely to appeal to potential new investors in the
market even if Lloyd's reduced the limit on new limited liability members
from the current Pounds 1.5m. Though the new breed of Lloyd's corporate
vehicles have not proved particularly popular with private individuals, they
should offer new investors similar potential returns as under the Citibank
scheme. They also have the important advantage that investors can sell all
or some of their interest at any time.
For Lloyd's itself, such schemes should slow the loss of capital put up by
Names. But they will do nothing to curb the market's high costs.
Administering the affairs of thousands of tiny companies will be just as
expensive as dealing with a multitude of Names.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle over Union Bank of Switzerland's special voting shares could be
moving in the board's favour. Mr Martin Ebner, the Zurich financier, has
accumulated a large position in the bank's registered shares - which have
extra voting power - with the aim of forcing changes in UBS's strategy. The
board has countered by pushing for the abolition of the registered shares'
privileges and their conversion into bearer shares. Yesterday, following the
publication of the board's latest missive on the subject, the premium
enjoyed by the registered shares over bearer shares sank to 15 per cent. For
most of the year, the premium has been over 25 per cent. UBS's desire for a
single class of shares is all very well. But its method of achieving it
flies in the face of natural justice. The change in share structure will be
put to a combined vote by both bearer and registered investors. That means
the registered shares could lose their privileges, even if most vote against
the board's proposal at next month's shareholder meeting.
UBS argues that the new share structure would benefit the registered
shareholders because it would stop Mr Ebner forcing a change in strategy
that would damage the bank. That seems implausible, since the premium
enjoyed by the registered shares would vanish completely if the board
carried the day. The least UBS should do is allow registered shareholders a
separate vote on the proposals. If the board is so confident in its case, it
should have nothing to fear.

FT  27 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The publicity surrounding recent flotation disasters has tended to leave the
impression that investing in UK new issues has become a quick way to lose
money. Yet analysis of all this year's flotations produces a rather
different picture. On average, they have outperformed the market, albeit by
a whisker. But while the proportion of duds may not be abnormal, the scale
of the losses on the flops has undoubtedly done some damage.
By putting bad apples into the market, sponsors have soured the institutions
which are now looking much more carefully at the new goods they offer. And
it is not just those involved in the disasters that suffer. Because some
sponsors have been less fastidious than they ought, the prices of good
quality flotations have been forced down, raising the cost of capital across
the market.
There seems to have been a specific problem with management buy-outs. This
may reflect the fact that by the end of last year stock market valuations
were so much higher than trade sale prices that venture capital backers
floated businesses which were not cut out to be independent quoted
companies.
In addition to the pressure on prices, the disasters have resulted in some
marginal floats being pulled. The fact that new issues since May have
comfortably outperformed the index may suggest that the market has already
corrected itself. Sceptical institutions reply that problems take time to
show through. But then they have every interest in talking prices down
further.

FT  27 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Ford's global drive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford's better than expected third-quarter results indicate bright domestic
and overseas prospects that could eventually allow the company to outpace
General Motors and Chrysler. The group only slightly lags its Japanese
rivals in productivity and has become the US's most cost-efficient
indigenous vehicle maker. That its north American product mix remains weak
explains why Ford's US net profits per unit, excluding financial earnings,
were just Dollars 575 (Pounds 364) compared with Chrysler's Dollars 1,013.
But the gap should close over the next 12 months as Ford launches a string
of new, high-margin vehicles.
Ford may make progress at home, but its best prospects are overseas. The
group should benefit from the upturn in Europe, where GM is struggling and
Chrysler has minimal presence. Ford is also positioning itself early in the
fast-growing Asian market, with its 24.5 per cent stake in Mazda and
recently announced ventures in India and China. The company aims to speed up
and cut the cost of new model development. If it can amortise this
investment by marketing the vehicles across the globe, it could achieve
large economies of scale similar to those achieved by Japanese
manufacturers.
Implementation will not be easy. The required internal revolution is
starting at a time of increasingly bitter competition at home and abroad, as
rivals add capacity in many of their markets. The temptation will be to
respond by radically customising models to meet regional tastes, as happened
when Ford tried to make the Escort a global car in the 1980s. Ford must
ensure such distractions do not deflect it from its current path.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Haunted by spectre of inflation: Despite the US Treasury's
cheerfulness, financial markets fear further interest rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, thinks it is the best of times to
hold his job.
'I'd say that the economic numbers are the best I've seen in 20 years. You
see low inflation, good sustained growth in the economy, and major creation
of jobs,' he said this week.
But the economic statistics that Mr Bentsen finds so encouraging have failed
to bring political benefits to the Clinton administration in the battle over
next month's mid-term elections.
They have also spread alarm on Wall Street that the US economy may still be
growing faster than can be sustained without sparking inflation. Bond
investors are now convinced that the Federal Reserve needs to raise
short-term interest rates in a hurry to keep inflation from breaking out.
This week they pushed long-term interest rates above 8 per cent for the
first time in two and a half years, and the dollar fell to its lowest level
against the yen since the second world war. New statistics published a week
ago suggested that the 1 3/4 percentage points by which the Fed has already
raised interest rates over the last eight months have failed to take the
steam out of even the most rate-sensitive sector, housing construction.
In July, when Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, delivered his half-yearly
testimony on monetary policy to Congress, the accepted economic wisdom -
broadly shared by the Fed, the administration and a consensus of private
sector forecasters - was that the economy would have a 'soft landing'.
At that time, the economy had already begun to slow down from the
unsustainably high 4.1 per cent annualised growth rate of the second quarter
this year. Even without further tightening of monetary policy by the Fed,
the economy was thought to be moving into a 'glide path' of steady growth -
between 2 1/4 and 2 3/4 per cent a year - before inflationary pressures had
been given a chance to build up.
The problem with the soft landing scenario is that policymakers have rarely
been able to achieve it in the past. Even if economists think it is a
plausible outcome, it is not one that investors are ready to bet on.
'The soft landing story has a better shot this time than at any time in the
last 40 years, but it will take more than economic projections to convince
the financial markets of the scenario in an investment sense,' said Mr Allen
Sinai, chief global economist with investment bank Lehman Brothers in New
York.
Pessimists say the signals suggest the economy is running full steam ahead,
close to or past the point at which pressure starts to build up on prices.
September's housing starts, for example, were 4.4 per cent up on August.
More significant is last month's fall in the unemployment rate to 5.9 per
cent. There are doubts about the reliability of the unemployment statistics,
because the Department of Labor changed its method of calculation at the
start of this year. Nevertheless, the unemployment level is now at or below
the 'natural rate' at which most members of the Federal Open Markets
Committee, the Fed's policy-setting body, believe the real slack in the
labour market has been absorbed. Labour shortages and pressure for higher
wages have already shown up in a few sectors.
US industry, meanwhile, was operating in September at 84.6 per cent of its
capacity, according to the Fed's calculations. That is a shade lower than in
August, but still close to the peaks reached in early 1989, before recession
set in. It is also above - perhaps by more than 2 1/2 percentage points -
the rate at which some economists argue production bottlenecks will start to
push up manufacturers' prices.
Growth in gross domestic product in the third quarter is due to be announced
by the Commerce Department tomorrow. The market consensus forecast,
according to MMS International, the financial information company, is for
2.8 per cent annualised growth, a considerable slowdown from the second
quarter's 4.1 per cent pace. Estimates have been edging up steadily over the
last two weeks, and the financial markets are already worried about the
possibility that growth has once again started to accelerate in the fourth
quarter.
'If the weak quarters are 3 per cent and the strong quarters are over 4 per
cent, then the trend is up in the 3 1/2 per cent range, which is above what
the Fed would like to see,' said Mr James O'Sullivan, an economist with
bankers JP Morgan in New York.
Despite the evidence of overheating, all the government's price indices show
inflation is still under control. Consumer prices rose by 0.2 per cent in
September for a year-on-year inflation rate of 3.0 per cent, with core
inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) also rising 0.2 per
cent. At the wholesale level, too, core producer price inflation reached
only 1.9 per cent year-on-year in September.
Employment cost statistics from the Labor Department show no sign of
acceleration in wage inflation. Wages and salaries have risen by just 2.9
per cent over the past year, the department reported this week, and wage
increases in important collective bargaining agreements signed in private
industry during the past three months have averaged only 1.9 per cent a
year.
But the financial markets tend to dismiss such inflation yardsticks as
backward-looking measurements. They believe the Fed is 'behind the curve' in
its efforts to choke off inflation before it picks up, and will be compelled
to raise interest rates by at least half a percentage point at the next
meeting of the FOMC on November 15 - and probably by as much again before
the end of the year.
Not all the members of the FOMC share this view. Mr Alan Blinder, the Fed's
vice-chairman, argued this week that, although the economy was showing fewer
signs of deceleration than he would have thought a few months ago, it had to
be remembered that monetary policy works with time lags.
'I think it probably is a fair interpretation of recent movements in the
bond market that there are a number of people that trade bonds for a living
that are in the 'behind the curve' school . . . I'm not convinced that they
are right,' Mr Blinder said.
But other members of the FOMC are more impatient. Mr Alfred Broaddus,
president of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, had wanted the Fed to raise
rates at its July meeting instead of delaying its most recent move until
August. Since then, he has sternly warned that it is not good enough for the
Fed to accept a 3 per cent inflation rate.
One reason why the Fed's five interest rate increases so far this year have
failed to take the steam even out of sectors sensitive to interest rates,
such as housing, is a steady loosening of bank credit. Banks have made
credit easier to obtain and have narrowed their lending margins, taking some
of the sting out of the Fed's actions.
This is a mirror image of the recession of 1991 and 1992, when a 'credit
crunch' caused by banks' tight lending policies reduced the impact of the
Fed's efforts to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates.
Then, the Fed was forced to cut further than it might otherwise have done.
This time, the Fed may have to raise rates further than it might otherwise
have done to offset these easy credit conditions - leading Mr Greenspan and
other FOMC members to issue a stream of warnings in recent weeks about
looser loan standards.
'Now the chairman is worrying in public that banks are becoming overly lax
in credit standards,' commented Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon
Brothers, the securities firm. 'By analogy with his earlier action, it
sounds as if he is setting the stage for more aggressive tightening.'
For the Clinton administration, there is little room to quarrel with the Fed
over another increase in interest rates. 'We share the same objectives as
the Fed of low inflation and long-term economic growth,' said Mr Bentsen.
Administration economists are even more convinced than the Fed that
inflation is well under control. They argue that heavy investment in
business equipment this year will raise the economy's capacity next year and
ease fears of bottlenecks.
But even congressional Democrats, who complained earlier in the year that
the Fed was trying to kill off the recovery, say that, because of the
evidence that the recovery remains strong, they are unlikely to object to a
November increase.
No one in the administration, after all, wants to see the kind of rapid
growth that would inevitably be followed by harsh Fed tightening and a
recession, just in time for the 1996 presidential election.

Heartened by the prompt response to yesterday's query about when is a quango
not a quango - a six-page briefing paper from the Cabinet Office had arrived
before morning coffee - Observer is now seeking an official definition of
sleaze.
According to Cassell's Concise English dictionary, it is anything which is
squalid, distasteful or disreputable. Since this could apply to the
behaviour of most MPs, let alone members of the Tory government, Observer is
looking for something more specific. What does the word stand for?
One reader has suggested that it is short for 'stay literally everywhere at
zero expense'. The best contribution will win a bottle of malt and be passed
on to the Cabinet Office. Who knows, it might even find its way into another
briefing paper.

What do elderly business tycoons talk about at lunch? According to Melvyn
Marckus, City editor of The Times, Lonrho's Tiny Rowland and Harrods boss
Mohamed Fayed were lunching together last week when the conversation turned
to the subject of penis transplants.
According to a report in The Times, Fayed told Rowland that he had asked the
Mayo clinic in the US whether he could have a 'larger penis'. Since Melvyn
Marckus used to work for Rowland as City editor of the Observer (before
Lonrho sold it to The Guardian), presumably he would not misquote his former
boss.
Those who know Fayed well are not surprised by such a line of conversation.
However, one wonders what members of the royal family and other patrons of
Harrods make of such talk? Poor old Gerald Ratner only had to admit that
some of his jewellery was 'crap' and his career was cut short.

Writing to head office to report 'opportunities to engage' - or new business

refreshing in their straightforwardness. 'Relationship built with HM prison;
30 accounts opened,' they say. 'It should have been 31 but inmate Tom was

First it's gnomes, now it's coffins. Naughty Poland - whose garden gnomes
were recently forbidden entry to Germany - is now exporting too many
coffins. Germany's coffin-makers are even less happy than normal.
The Germans complain that the quality of the Polish boxes is not up to
German standards; they used the same complaint to stop an invasion of Polish
gnomes.
The fact that Polish coffins may be cheaper has obviously impressed
consumers - who spend DM12bn a year on the paraphernalia of death - but the
coffin-makers, like countless other producers in Germany, seem not to have
noticed.

Things are really starting to look up for Kelvin MacKenzie, the legendary
former editor of The Sun. An admirer of Lady Thatcher and all that she stood
for, MacKenzie's departure from News Corporation via the BSkyB satellite
company left him without any big pay-offs or share options.
Fortunately, he has ended up at the Mirror Group which, despite its
left-leaning stance, knows how to motivate its heavy hitters. MacKenzie has
been showered with 155,038 share options at 129p which means that he is
already sitting on a Pounds 24,000 paper profit.
Even so, how Kelvin must envy David Montgomery, his new boss and former
chief sub on The Sun. Not only is Montgomery younger than MacKenzie, but his
entry in Who's Who is more than five times as big and he has 10 times as
many share options at less than half the price. Should have jumped ship
earlier, Kelvin.

Brazilians could be forgiven an uneasy twinge of deja vu. While former
president Fernando Collor lives as a recluse in the capital Braslia
following his 1992 resignation amid corruption charges, his younger brother
is now following in his footsteps.
Pedro Collor, who failed to win election to the legislative assembly of the
poor northern state of Alagoas in elections earlier this month, has been
given the consolation prize of secretary of industry and commerce in the
state government. This is precisely the same job which gave Fernando Collor
his start in politics in 1976.
There is little chance of the two brothers teaming up. It was Pedro who made
the initial, ruinous allegations against his brother, apparently sparked by
a family row; they have apparently not spoken for some time. Fernando,
meanwhile, is still smarting from a court decision earlier this year to
uphold an eight-year ban preventing him holding political office.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Citadel storm
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The apparent storm in a teacup between the two main rightwing contestants
for next year's French presidential election looks set to fracture a great
deal of Gallic porcelain. For several months, antipathy has been growing
between the two main figures in France's Gaullist RPR party, Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, the party leader and mayor of Paris.
This week the squabbling has burst into the open following Mr Balladur's
accusation that Mr Chirac has been using the Gaullist party as a 'citadel'
in which to take refuge from the world outside.
Although this almost certainly was not his intention, Mr Balladur has
publicly put his finger on a central problem confronting today's inheritors
of the mantle of President de Gaulle. Their inability to reconcile the
doctrines laid down in his name with the requirements of France and Europe
after the end of the cold war represents a crucial political handicap for
the right. This failure encouraged disillusioned Gaullists to seek solace in
fringe parties in the June elections for the European parliament.
France's left wing is in a still more sorry state than the RPR, but the
conservative infighting can only benefit Mr Jacques Delors, the Socialist
president of the European Commission. If, as expected, he runs for the
presidency next year, Mr Delors would rely powerfully on his perceived
attractiveness to middle-ground voters - an appeal that Mr Chirac, in
particular, manifestly lacks.
The recent description of Mr Delors as 'the candidate of German Christian
Democracy' by the former Socialist defence minister, Mr Jean-Pierre
Chevenement, was no doubt meant as a jibe, but it could have a prophetic
ring. Chancellor Helmut Kohl owes his four successive election victories to
his ability to maintain support across a broad swathe of conservative and
centrist voters. No present-day French politician can match this appeal.
In one sense, the Balladur-Chirac duel reflects the inevitable frustration
of like-minded politicians bidding for a prize they covet and suspect may be
slipping away. But the squabble also reflects a wider failure of adaptation
of the French political system. France badly needs an organised form of
preselection of candidates for the presidential elections to avoid a
damaging abundance of rivals from the same camp and give their policies
clarity and coherence.
Another conservative hopeful, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the
centre-right UDF grouping, has pointed out that the right has three times
fielded rival candidates since 1958 and won. However, the proliferation of
wounded pride and wounded egos on the right contributed to Mr Francois
Mitterrand's success in the 1988 presidential election, and could
conceivably presage another conservative defeat next year.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the RPR interior minister, has suggested US-style primary
elections to select the right's preferred candidate well in advance of the
presidential poll. The idea has been given only a lukewarm reception, yet
the right needs to end quickly the rivalry in its own ranks. Mr Balladur and
Mr Chirac would be wise to back Mr Pasqua's proposal.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Local sense
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Local Government Commission is to be congratulated for seeing sense at
last and drawing back from a wholesale reconstruction of local authorities
across England. Its recommendations for nine counties represent a broadly
fair balance between the desire of a few towns and cities to break free of
their county councils, and the antipathy of the electorate as a whole to
further expensive musical chairs in local government.
The commission should apply the same principles as it makes final
recommendations for the rest of England's counties in the next two months.
The duty will then be on Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, to abandon
hopes for introducing single-tier authorities where they are not strongly
desired by the voters.
Mr Gummer's decision this week to reject proposals from the commission to
abolish North Yorkshire and Somerset county councils is a clear sign that he
has already done so. He could go one better and reject any further
commission proposals to abolish counties outright. On the basis of the
public consultation, it is hard to justify abolishing any counties beyond
the two - Avon and Humberside, both spawned by the last reorganisation in
1974 - which he agreed to scrap yesterday.
Once the present review is completed, several lessons need to be learnt for
the future. On the positive side, the effort made by the commission to gauge
public opinion before publishing firm decisions was commendable, and appears
to have been vital in avoiding a shambolic conclusion. The response to the
postal referendums was for the most part derisory; but this itself reflected
the absence of popular enthusiasm for reform. The wider use of local
referendums is to be encouraged.
There is, however, a debit side. No review process was established before
the government sought to impose single-tier authorities in Wales and
Scotland. What do people think there? And in England, the review has done
little to revitalise local democracy. With resentment about
government-by-quango growing, the malaise in local government will have to
be addressed by the new commission on standards in public life.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Misreading the road map
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A web of asphalt spreading over the green fields of England: that is one of
the nightmare visions conjured up by yesterday's report on UK transport
policy from the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. Its authors, 16
scientists and environmental experts, foresee a future where Britain builds
miles of new roads, at ever-increasing cost, but fails entirely to relieve
the traffic jams choking its cities and junctions.
Many share those fears. Environmentalists have warmly welcomed the
commission's warnings and most of its 100 recommendations. But this
congested report, two years in preparation, does little to clear the road
ahead.
That is unfortunate because it is entirely right in starting from the
principle that road users should pay the full environmental and health costs
of the roads: pollution, accidents, noise and loss of amenities. It is
indisputably right, too, in observing that it is hard to set such prices.
Pollution and noise can be measured straightforwardly, but some health
implications are unclear. Medical researchers suspect that exhaust fumes are
an important factor behind the rising incidence of asthma, but have not yet
proved the link.
But such difficulties should not deter calculations; they simply imply that
the conclusions should be repeatedly reviewed. The commission provides a
good example: it calls use of super unleaded petrol, portrayed for years as
'green', into question for causing emission of high levels of benzene.
The figures assembled by the commission, if imperfect, are illuminating. It
puts the environmental costs of road use by all vehicles at between Pounds
4.6bn and Pounds 12.9bn. Accidents add a further Pounds 5.4bn. After taking
account of building costs, it estimates that revenue raised from road users
ranges from 121 per cent of total costs to 81 per cent.
The estimates clearly portray heavy goods vehicles as the villains, covering
only between half and two-thirds of their unit costs. The commission is
right to conclude that measures should be taken to ensure they close that
gap.
But it begins to veer off its route in addressing cars and light goods
vehicles. The report suggests that these more than cover the total costs of
their use of the roads. But it nonetheless wants taxes on these vehicles to
be raised in order to protect the countryside - an environmental asset it
considers priceless.
That step reveals the weakness of the report: an excess of morality over
economics. The authors assert that it can be morally wrong to trade
environmental assets against the benefits of mobility. They exhort people to
walk more and get fitter per se, instead of driving.
The conclusion the report should have reached is that, provided road use is
correctly priced, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with building more
roads if needed. That is not to preclude more investment in public
transport, one of the commission's main recommendations. In central London,
for example, it is clearly wanted and needed. But throughout, the report
portrays public transport as a better substitute for roads than it is
capable of being, however well maintained.
The commission is right that government has done a poor job of assessing
Britain's transport needs for the future. Its report does not, however, fill
the gap.

FT  27 OCT 94 / War by other means: David Buchan argues that France regards
virtually all tactics as fair in trade policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halloween this year coincides with the ritual of the Night of the Long
Knives when newly appointed European commissioners carve up the portfolios -
and themselves.
Mr Jacques Santer, the new Commission president who will allocate the jobs
this weekend, has recently had a timely reminder of why entrusting Europe's
trade and industry policy to a French commissioner would be widely
considered as daft as putting a Briton in charge of farm policy.
France has threatened to veto an international agreement to scrap
shipbuilding subsidies painstakingly negotiated by the outgoing Commission
with other industrial countries.
Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European Union affairs minister, has promised
French MPs that he is ready to invoke 'vital national interests' to block
the agreement. Yet the sector employs just 5,880 people out of a total
workforce of nearly 20m.
French presidential politics are partly to blame. Mr Jacques Chirac, who is
rivalling Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to be the main conservative
candidate in next spring's presidential election, has for reasons best known
to himself made support for French shipbuilding an obsessional part of his
campaign for the Elysee. Mr Balladur believes he must match him in this
obsession.
But in fighting to retain subsidies for shipbuilding, both men follow in a
long tradition of state interventionism that goes back to the 17th century
and Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's economic overlord.
Colbert subsidised many shipbuilding and shipowning companies, which all
collapsed when his death brought the subsidies to an end. Some would argue
this showed the pointlessness of creating such artificial companies in the
first place. Others - including the present French government - seem to see
the real error in putting a stop to subsidies.
Yet the Colbertin sense of being in a permanent economic struggle with other
countries still pervades modern French thinking to a remarkable degree. The
only difference is that France's chief economic enemies today are the US and
Japan; in Jean-Baptiste's day, it was England and Holland.
Earlier this month, France's defence and economics ministries sponsored a
teach-in on 'economic war' in Paris. This showed that the French - in a way
that is both admirable and irritating - refuse to sit on the laurels of
their undoubted achievements in foreign trade, which include last year's
FFr80bn (Pounds 10bn) trade surplus recorded in spite of a generally strong
franc.
France believes that foreign competitors are waging total economic war
against the country, and therefore regards virtually all tactics as fair in
parrying these attacks. General Francois Mermet, the retired head of
France's DGSE intelligence service, which was once accused of spying on US
industry, told the conference that France should have 'no hang-ups' in
mobilising all its resources in the battle for foreign contracts.
The French sense that world trade is somehow unfair is reinforced in an area
dear to Colbert's heart - luxury goods. Mercantilists such as Colbert
believed that a country should run a payments surplus to gain gold to pay
mercenaries or bribe enemies in time of war. But Colbert added the
refinement that the surplus should be in luxury goods which are, by
definition, not essential to any war effort and might have the added benefit
of rendering foreign consumers more effete.
Three centuries later, France has half the world market in luxury goods,
according to the aptly named Colbert Committee which represents French
fashion, perfume, wines and spirits companies.
Many of these products are easy to fake, leaving the country exposed to
counterfeiting. And France has taken draconian measures this year against
counterfeiters.
However, economic nationalism has become harder to justify with
international co-operation in industries such as aerospace and defence.
Their products commonly have components from several different European
countries.
The view increasingly proclaimed in France, therefore, is that in aerospace
and defence, all Europeans are on the same side. They face a common enemy in
an American industry that is determined to offset the sharp contraction in
its home defence market by killing off European competitors, with Washington
using or abusing political influence in US client states where necessary.
Giving substance to this Euro-rhetoric, France opened last week's biennial
navy equipment exhibition in Paris to other European defence companies under
the name of 'Euronaval'.
It is perhaps a pity that Mr Santer does not have a defence dossier to
distribute, because there the French are certainly thinking European.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Awful 'vision' but some good ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A frequent criticism of policy groups is that their principles are fine, but
they are short on detailed proposals on how to implement them.
The report of Labour's so-called Commission on Social Justice - chair Sir
Gordon Borrie - is just the opposite. The principles vary between the
platitudinous, the meaningless and the wrong-headed. But there are some good
individual proposals, which needed to be rescued from the surrounding
material with a greater exercise of charity and imagination than the
commission members were willing to extend to their own intellectual
opponents.
It is, however, unnecessarily difficult to carry out the necessary
extraction. The Executive Summary is not that at all, but a party political
pamphlet. There is no index. The book is both insular and partisan. Every
idea is presented as novel and utterly different from the government's.
Examples from other countries are brought in for debating purposes. But
there is little recognition that the problems it describes affect most
western countries, irrespective of the party in power.
To take one example, the British government is castigated for the low
proportion of the population at work; but no mention is made of the fact
that the proportion is lower still in most other European countries, whose
degree of labour market regulation the commission so much envies. Above all,
there is no costed programme or even a list of costed options of the kind
that is standard, for instance, in the work of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies.
This is a great wasted opportunity. For the potential value of a group like
the Borrie commission is that it can put forward proposals which do not
commit its political sponsors. Tackling the poverty and unemployment traps
is an expensive operation, if benefits are not to be cut or more harshly
administered. But there are more and less cost-effective ways of doing so.
It would be better to give some honest estimates than an open-ended list of
proposals and possibilities, with the half-hearted hint that they might be
paid for by economic growth - as Ronald Reagan's tax cuts were supposed to
have been. Hardly a model to appeal to a modernised Labour party.
I suspect that the first few chapters will be passed over as 'guff' by
numbers merchants of all persuasions. But bad guff gives political economy a
bad name. We are given these alternative prescriptions: (a) an 'Investors'
Britain', (b) a 'Deregulators' Britain' and (c) a 'Levellers' Britain'. As
if these titles were not contentious enough, the first is identified with a
'fair and prosperous Britain', the second with a 'harsher Britain' and the
third with a 'kindly, poorer Britain'. Why did not the philosopher member,
Professor Bernard Williams, apply the standard critique of 'Persuasive
Definitions' to this section?
The labels, however, will not be persuasive to those with enough economic
logic to know that investment is itself a cost, not a benefit, best seen as
by-product of entrepreneurial search for new products, processes and
customers. There is a highly misleading chart supposedly linking the growth
of output per worker to the share of net investment in GDP. We are not told
of the period over which the relationship is supposed to apply. The only
source we are given is the New York Review of Books, without even an author.
The chart fails to include the former communist countries which had the
highest investment ratios of all and - as we now know - the worst economic
performance.
It was inevitable that the commission would support minimum wage legislation
in view of former Labour leader John Smith's dug-in attitude. But the
commission's own figures show that it is an extremely ineffective way of
dealing with poverty, which varies so much with family circumstances. Its
main weapon is a number of studies purporting to show that minimum wages in
some industries and countries do not destroy jobs, relying on the reader's
ignorance of other studies showing the opposite.
The market economist is meant to applaud the commission for proposing a
minimum wage of Pounds 3.50 per hour rather than the higher sums demanded by
union leaders, as if a perverse medicine can be defended by the moderation
of the dose. Is the Pounds 3.50 minimum meant to apply to part-time or only
full-time workers? If it applies to the latter, it will only increase the
shift to part-time jobs. If it is to apply to any work done by anyone, then
it means that a householder who cannot afford to pay that rate for a few
hours' work by a jobbing carpenter will have to resort to do-it-herself -
even though this makes both sides worse off and is in contravention of one
human being's right to make a contract with another so long as there are no
large adverse spillover effects.
The most radical single idea is the Pension Guarantee. This, thankfully,
abandons the Labour commitment to wasteful across-the-board increases in
state pensions. Instead there are to be more generous and more humane top-up
arrangements than at present for pensioners with little or no other income.
There is, of course, much casuistry to avoid using words like selectivity
and means testing. Less happily, mandatory second pension schemes seem to be
advocated - which is too near compulsory saving for a liberal.
Many detailed but important low cost improvements are put forward which
might make Family Credit more effective in topping up the incomes of
families with low earnings from employment. Another good idea, canvassed
rather than firmly proposed, is that of merging Family Credit with Income
Support for the unemployed. At least that is better than the Conservative
Job Seeker's Allowance, which puts an iron curtain between the two.
The Borrie commission is also more favourable than the government to low
cost proposals to allow the unemployed some modest earnings from casual work
without losing benefit. Furthermore, there are reforms in Housing Benefit,
which could make it less of a work disincentive than it now is when combined
with Family Credit. All through one would like tabulated statements about
losers as well as gainers.
One can also applaud the suggested phasing out of the Married Couple's
Allowance. This was originally meant to happen when individual taxation was
introduced, but one rather important married couple vetoed the idea. The
allowance is now being partially phased out by Kenneth Clarke. But unlike
the chancellor, I would also support the channelling of the savings from
ending it into children's benefits. Children are more at risk from poverty
than childless couples or older single people; and they did not ask to be
born.
That does not mean sharing the Borrie enthusiasm for channelling everything
saved into across-the-board increases in Child Benefit - still less into
nursery education which looks like vying with industrial training as the fad
of the hour. I would prefer some of it to be channelled into income-related
benefits. Most of all, I was pleased to see the incorporation, if only as a
suggestion, of Hermione Parker's idea of a modest Participation Income for
all, which would be conditional not on seeking paid employment but on any
kind of service for other people.
Those of us who believe in individualism with a human face (which means
something less grudging and punitive than the government's ideas) should not
hesitate to raid Borrie for ideas and dialectical support. But on no account
should we allow it monopoly of insight, compassion, imagination or any other
aspect of the 'vision thing'.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Super unleaded ban no solution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADAM SEYMOUR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Commons transport committee's proposal that super unleaded should
be banned ('MPs row with oil industry on unleaded petrol safety', October
26) must be considered with the lessons of the past in mind. If the leaded
versus unleaded gasoline debate has taught us anything, it is that banning
is no solution. Without clear guidelines as to what lead should be replaced
with, industry naturally opted for the most cost-effective means: namely the
replacement of lead in petrol with aromatics (of which benzene is one).
With what high-quality additives could the oil industry replace aromatics if
government decided as a result of this proposal that their use should be
restricted? In the short run aromatics could be replaced by alcohols or
ethers, imported Methyl-Tertiary-Butyl-Ether (MTBE) being the least-cost
option. However, studies into the effects of adding MTBE have shown that the
benefits of reduced benzene emissions may be counterbalanced by increased
emissions of other toxic substances, namely formaldehyde and acetaldehyde.
In the long run, the government could introduce incentives for investment in
different oil-processing technologies that do not produce aromatics. An
alternative for refiners is to increase the level of olefins, another type
of hydrocarbon used to boost gasoline quality. Again, research has shown
that there is a trade-off in this approach between reduced benzene and
increased emissions with ozone-forming potential. Further, little is known
as to the toxicity of olefin-related emissions.
The proposed banning of super unleaded is not a solution to the problem of
benzene and aromatics. It raises the highly emotive issue of benzene without
indicating any direction for the future.

<TEXT>
Sir, The answers to the questions posed by Mr Jonathan Ruffer in the first
paragraph of his article (Personal View, October 25) are surely given in the
last. International bond markets which were drunk on excess liquidity in
1992-93 have now awoken to the cold dawn of rising interest rates, and set
yields at level which discount likely future inflation rates. Only a
dwindling bank of ageing teenage scribblers believes that current low levels
of inflation can safely be extrapolated into the indefinite future.

Sir, Insurance companies now face a compensation bill of up to Pounds 2bn
for wrong pension advice. Where are they going to get the money from? Surely
they are going to clip all policies to pay the cost. They will doubtless
find a justification in the fine print.
If so, then anyone who invested via an insurance company suffered a risk of
having their investment clipped to pay compensation. Were they warned of
this risk? If not, they are entitled to compensation. We may be entering a
compensation loop.

   From Mr A E N BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the current debate on the sale of personal pensions to members of
occupational pension schemes, two important facts seem to be overlooked.
First, at the time of the introduction of personal pensions, the government
offered apparently significant incentives in the form of rebate of
contributions to the state earnings-related scheme (SERPS), to encourage
people to make their own personal pension provision. It was this rebate, as
I recall, which was a major feature in the selling propositions of personal
pensions advisers.
Second, the 'better value' offered by many occupational schemes rests
largely or solely on the fact that today the majority of companies which run
their own such schemes still offer significantly higher remuneration (in the
form of employer pension contributions) to employees prepared to join the
company scheme than to those who prefer to make their own arrangements.
This anachronism can surely not be justified on any objective or rational
grounds.

Sir, your article, 'The high cost of bad advice', is apposite. I wonder when
the real perpetrator of the current imbroglio facing the life sector will be
in the dock?
It was the government in its headlong rush to privatise everything,
including occupational pensions schemes, that created the personal pensions
regime - which, in turn, led to the mis-selling. This was fuelled by the
National Insurance rebate. Quite a scam really] Yet some insurers still give
money to the Conservative party.

Sir, Lex writes that 'the scale of the UK's personal pensions scandal
continues to shock' ('Pensions', October 26). The FT is being too modest;
you blew the whistle on personal pensions more than four years ago.
Our files show that on January 6 1990, you published the view that Norman
Fowler, the minister responsible for the new personal pensions, 'has put the
pension clock back half a century'. The article correctly states that people
buying personal pensions 'have no idea what benefits their contributions
will eventually buy' - and was appropriately headed 'Paying dearly for
Norman's knighthood'.

<TEXT>
Sir, I imagine that few tears are being shed for the life insurance industry
as it contemplates the compensation bill for the personal pensions scandal
('The high cost of bad advice', October 26).
However, there is an unfortunate tendency in the media to talk about the
'pensions' industry when reporting the issue. This risks further damaging
the already somewhat tarnished image of occupational pension schemes in a
way which would be completely unfair.
It is very easy in these situations to be wise after the event. However, in
this case - and it makes the scandal much worse - the pensions industry
predicted that this would happen. During 1986 and 1987 pension scheme
trustees, employers and advisers fought a campaign to warn government of the
consequences of unleashing a commission-hungry salesforce on vulnerable
people faced with complex financial choices. Self-regulation never stood a
chance, but government, fired with ideology about personal choice and
encouraged from the sidelines by a life insurance industry smacking its
lips, dismissed this campaign as paternalistic vested interest.
The rest, as they say, is history. While it must now be the responsibility
of the life insurance industry to foot the bill, it is to be hoped that
occupational pension schemes will co-operate fully in the process of
repairing the damage by re-admitting those who have lost out. And may the UK
working population then recognise who its friends really are.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Scott's clean sheet: Tony Jackson speaks to Al Dunlap, the
papermaker's tough boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By: TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philadelphia headquarters of Scott Paper, the world's biggest tissue
maker, are a pleasant sight on a fine autumn morning: squirrels scamper by
the pond and the flags of nations flap in the breeze.
Mr Al Dunlap, Scott's new boss, hates it. The success of a corporation, he
says, is in inverse proportion to the size of its headquarters. Corporate
HQs are monuments to the chief executive's ego. Scott's is up for sale.
So is much of the rest of the company. Earlier this month Mr Dunlap sold its
coated papermaking business for Dollars 1.6bn. On Monday he sold its power
stations for Dollars 350m. Still to go are its woodlands and pulp mills,
bringing the grand total, he hopes, to Dollars 3bn.
Since Mr Dunlap arrived as head of Scott Paper in April, 34 per cent of its
worldwide staff - 11,000 people - have lost their jobs. He believes this is
a record: IBM may have sacked more in absolute numbers, but their proportion
was a mere 13 per cent. He is particularly proud of the fact that 71 per
cent of Scott's headquarters staff have gone, including nine of its
11-strong executive committee.
The result of all this, he says, is 'one of the great stories in corporate
America today'. When he arrived, Scott was 'a stodgy old company which had
totally lost its way'. In six months, he has turned it round. The proof lies
in the only criterion he cares about: the share price has risen more than 60
per cent.
Mr Dunlap started out as a military man, and it shows. An ex-paratrooper
with a parade-ground voice, he had his first taste of management running a
nuclear missile site near Washington in the early 1960s. After a career in
industry which began with Scott's rival, Kimberley Clark, he spent the late
1980s as chief hatchet-man for Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French
financier. Had Sir James's bids for either US group Goodyear Tire or BAT
Industries, the British conglomerate, succeeded, Mr Dunlap would have been
sent in to run them.
His admiration for Sir James remains unstinting: 'Clearly the smartest
person I ever met in my life, and the next was a footnote to him.' In
everything, he says, they thought alike. The alliance seems an odd one: Sir
James, the polished Old Etonian, and Mr Dunlap, the son of a shipyard worker
from Hoboken, New Jersey. But each is in his own way an outsider; and
nowhere is this more evident than in their shared contempt for corporate
America.
'Sir James and I coined the phrase 'corpocracy' - companies run for the
benefit of bureaucrats rather than the shareholders. I take the simple view
that the shareholders run the company. They take all the risk. Show me the
company which pays the shareholders back if things go wrong, and I'll show
you the company that can afford to ignore them.
'Scott was a microcosm of that. Its shareholders would have been better off
captured by terrorists. They'd have been treated better.'
The Dollars 3bn he is raising through the sale of assets, he says, is equal
to Dollars 40 a share. 'When I joined the company, the share price was
Dollars 37.75. Back in the Goldsmith days, that would have been a godsend.
You could have bought the world's biggest tissue company for nothing.'
Those responsible have paid the price. 'When you do a turnround, you must by
definition get rid of the top people. They're the people who got it wrong,
and if they did it once they'll do it again. Every corporation has a
culture. In a corporation which is not doing well, you must eradicate the
culture.' He thumps the table.
The problem about turnrounds, he says, is that people dislike change and
respond to it with criticism. 'That's where managers fail. They succumb to
criticism. I don't have that problem. If you want to be liked, get a dog: in
business, get respect.' (He himself has two dogs. Sir James's comment on
this was: 'I see you're hedging your bets.')
Now that the turnround Mr Dunlap has engineered with such shocking
suddenness is almost complete, where does Scott goes from here? Mr Dunlap
shrewdly recognises that he has an image problem on this. He is indelibly
associated with the corporate raiders of the 1980s, of whom the standard
criticism was that they could cut costs, but they could not build.
He is quick to reject the charge. It was never as true as people said, he
claims. Sir James and he invested far more than people gave them credit for,
and he is investing a lot in Scott now: in a new venture in China, in
Mexico, in Arizona.
Ask him where the world leader in tissues goes from here, and he instantly
says it is not the leader, just the largest. 'We're not the best. Our best
competitor now is probably Procter &amp; Gamble. They're a good marketing
company.' He has just recruited an ex-Procter man to run his marketing.
Besides, he observes, much of the paper industry is more concerned with
tonnages than with making money. 'I asked a guy here how much we made in a
particular grade, and he said, so many tonnes. I said, what's that in
dollars? And he said, I'll come back to you.
'I thought, this guy's a humorist. I enjoy a joke, I was waiting to see what
he'd come back with. It turned out he was serious.' It seemed superfluous to
ask what happened next.
Since he joined the company, he has invested Dollars 4m of his own money in
Scott shares. In a move calculated to cause a flutter in corporate America,
he has decreed that all non-executive directors will be paid exclusively in
company stock.
The shareholders, he insists again, are all that matter. 'If you're paid to
run the corporation, then by God run the corporation. If you do your job and
pay your taxes, the rest takes care of itself.'

FT  27 OCT 94 / Arts: Mixed-up Risen People - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Sheridan, the award-winning writer/director of such films as In The Name
of the Father and My Left Foot, has returned to his theatrical roots with
The Risen People, the story of the 1913 Irish labour lockout which he has
co-adapted and co-directed with his brother Peter at Dublin's Gaiety
Theatre.
Sheridan has said that he took on the project, his first play in nearly a
decade, as an experiment to incorporate the grand gestures of opera into
theatre.
And indeed there is much that is operatic about The Risen People: from the
size of the cast - 15 principals, four singers and 21 supernumeraries - to
the look and scale of the production.
On a massive, elegant set of receding angled frames, a state-of-the-art
lighting system projects scenes from Dublin life while live sung scenes from
Aida mingle with the action on stage.
But the medium The Risen People most brings to mind is film, not opera: it
is Sheridan's attempt to bring cinematic storytelling techniques to the
stage.
Scenes overlap in a series of montages, plots and subplots mingle and
accumulate, character is revealed less through dialogue or symbolic action
than through behaviour.
The crucial element the Sheridans fail to provide is the camera, or its
stage equivalent. There is no dramatic focus to the action, no cues are
given to the viewer on where to look or how to absorb the goings-on, and
there is no gradation between the intimate and grand-scale.
The effect is (I imagine) like watching the filming of a Cecil B. DeMille
epic: at once visually overwhelming and stultifying.
The Risen People tells the true story of the first organised labour uprising
in Ireland, in which 400 employers, led by William Martin Murphy, banded
together against a nascent union movement headed by the Englishman 'Big' Jim
Larkin.
Starvation and violence plagued the striking workers and their families, and
they were on the verge of admitting defeat when the conflict was
overshadowed by the outbreak of the first world war.
The Sheridan brothers first directed The Risen People, based on James
Plunkett's 1958 play of the same name on which he also based his
best-selling novel Strumpet City, in 1977 during their stint as artistic
directors of Dublin's Project Arts Centre.
This production features some of the leading talents in Irish theatre -
Donal Donnelly and Johnny Murphy are in wizened good form, though Tom Hickey
looks to be marking time - as well as less seasoned performers.
David Herlihy makes a strong showing as Fitz, the young labour organiser,
but Lorraine Pilkington is out of her depth as his wife, Annie. It is her
Aida-like struggle between her love for Fitz
and her allegiance to her privileged father which is the ostensible reason
for the distracting and faintly ridiculous inclusion of portions of that
opera in the show.
The Risen People is the most expensive production in Irish theatre history,
with a budget estimated at IPounds 300,000 (Pounds 297,000)-IPounds 500,000.
Jim Sheridan is listed as producer as well as adaptor/director, so we can
assume that he has provided at least part of the funds from his film-making
profits.
Such reinvestment of film money back into theatre is an enlightened idea
that has taken hold in the US. It would be churlish not to applaud the
establishment of such a precedent in Ireland, but lax to do anything but
chide an artistic effort as sloppy as The Risen People.
At the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, through November.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Arts: Tireless Solti fires up LSO - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not everybody is joining in the London Symphony Orchestra's birthday
celebrations. Reflecting on last year's bruising battle for cash, the
managing director of a rival London orchestra recently observed sourly that
only the LSO kept its mouth shut when the time came for the orchestras to
stand up for fair play.
Out of range of the firing line, the LSO had clearly decided its own
interests were best served by keeping its head down. Alone of the London
orchestras, it had not been required to present itself as a competitor for
funds, in effect judged a winner before battle commenced.
The LSO is certainly entering its 90th birthday season in fine fettle.
Unlike its London rivals, it is not in debt, has a secure home, and is in a
position to plan for its future with confidence.
On Tuesday it presented a gala concert to benefit the LSO Millennium Fund
(such hubris, when the other London orchestras will be glad to survive as
far as the millennium at all]). The event was also part of the 'Great
Orchestras of the World' series at the Barbican, which seems rather a cheat
when the purpose of the event is to promote visiting foreign orchestras, but
perhaps a point was being made there, too.
The LSO likes to see itself on a par with the leading orchestras of Europe
and the US. Tuesday's concert - an all-Brahms programme under Georg Solti -
was not the best evidence to support that claim, but at least the playing
was strong and vital.
Ironically, the main competition recently in Brahms' First Symphony was at
the Proms with the Dresden Staatskapelle under Colin Davis, the LSO's own
music director elect, who performed the music with the utmost refinement.
In his LSO appearances over the past few years Davis has started to instil
some of that well-bred finesse, but Solti clearly prefers the LSO as it used
to be. His Brahms was a high-octane drive down the symphonic fast lane,
arteries pumping with tension, foot down on the volume control.
It is astonishing that Solti in his 80s still has this kind of energy. As
the last movement powered towards its conclusion, he was bounding from side
to side of the podium, arms jerking violently through the air as though
whipping the final chords into place.
There was limited scope for the autumnal Brahms to show his face, either
here or in the Violin Concerto. Itzhak Perlman's view of the solo part as an
outpouring of lyricism, unfailingly sweet in tone and generous with
portamentos, really presupposes a different kind of performance.
Apparently tireless, Solti ended the evening by throwing in the overture to
Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia as an encore. Only a few years and he will
be enjoying a 90th birthday season himself.

THE BROWNING VERSION (15) Mike Figgis
RAPA NUI (12) Kevin Reynolds
FEAR OF A BLACK HAT (15) Rusty Cundieff
MAJOR LEAGUE II (PG) David S. Ward
LONDON FILM FESTIVAL
Few in this island will have restrained a giggle at the vision of British
boarding school life presented in the recent Smoking/No Smoking. Alain One
(Resnais) hijacked Alan Two (Ayckbourn) to give us what seemed a cross
between PG Wodehouse and the wilder scenic fancies of Fragonard. For
non-Britons, it was clear: Idiocy plus Idyll equals the public school.
So naturally we turn to The Browning Version for realism. Produced by Ridley
Scott and directed by Mike Figgis (Stormy Monday, Mr Jones), this stars
Albert Finney as the unloved, dicky-hearted classics teacher of Terence
Rattigan's stage play. All these chaps are British, so we should be safe.
But wait. Ten minutes into this tale of Andrew Crocker-Harris and the
heartless, unpensioned retirement forced on him by his school, and we are
hankering for the documentary exactitudes of Resnais. This tweedy, stilted
place seems even more unreal than Resnais' Franglais-sur-mer College.
An hour in - after we learn that the hero's wife (Greta Scacchi) is
canoodling with the American chemistry teacher (Matthew Modine), who has
been hired on an exchange basis with Hollywood, and that Greta will never
show Albert as much love as does the one grateful pupil who gives him the
eponymous Aeschylus translation as a parting gift - and we feel that some
serious surrealism is setting in.
All these odd Caribbean complexions. For this is a Paramount-produced film
and no American (the studio's thinking probably goes) will believe that
public schools are actually filled with pale, spotty people who look as if
they spent their formative years in a badger tunnel.
And then there is that odd cricket match in which the fielders cry 'Howzat]'
when someone is bowled. And then there is that overcranked ending when the
whole school rises to applaud Crocker-Finney's farewell speech as
Crocker-Scacchi stands at the rear of the hall shedding - yes] - a silent
tear as the music by Mark Isham (A River Runs Through It) swells.
Unbelievable. In all senses. The only actor to stem the tide of
implausibility is Albert Finney, bravely reaching out for moments of truth
and unexaggerated poignancy from his toby-jug frame.
The rest of the film, wrongheadedly updated from Rattigan's period-perfect
original, is made for the age of synthesised, fast-food foreign culture
tasting. Goodbye, Mr French Fries.
Rapa Nui, a South Seas epic by Kevin Reynolds (director of the Kevin Costner
Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves), speculates on how Easter Island may have
become a treeless wilderness filled with statues.
In the late 17th century, the film hazards, the Short Ears tribe fought the
Long Ears after the LEs had spent many years forcing the SEs to build those
rock figures topped with weird visages. Palms were felled to provide
scaffolding and rolling tracks. Food ran out. Natives got restless.
Things came to a head during the annual Birdman race, in which Noro (Jason
Scott Lee, Long Ears) vied with Make (Esai Morales, Short Ears) to be the
first man to swim back from the neighbouring island and shin up the sheer
cliffs with an unbroken egg strapped to his forehead.
The victor of this early, remarkable jeu sans frontieres - we keep expecting
the late Eddie Waring to burst out with 'And a fine move there by the Long
Eared team . . .' - will win both power and the hand of the beautiful Ramana
(Sandrine Holt). She has been in the Cave of the Virgins for six months,
though spoiling the sacrificial effort by emerging pregnant.
Meanwhile the island's absentminded ruler (Eru Potaka Dewes) frets over his
multiplying statues - 'One day we'll get these right,' he waves - and the
evil high priest (George Henare) keeps sending islanders to a better world
by hitting them with a paddle.
I shouldn't have, but when not laughing I loved this film. Knee-deep in the
ridiculous, Rapa Nui also keeps clawing its way to the sublime. I wish I had
tape-recorded the press show reaction. We all began by giggling into our
handouts. By the close you could hear a pin drop.
By the close the plot has become so surreal that it is worthy of Werner
Herzog. The coda involves a journey to a magically whitened island - the
next world? - as eerie as anything in Aguirre or Heart Of Glass. It crowns a
movie whose visual spectacle - it was actually shot on Easter Island - keeps
transcending its bathetic dialogue and pained plot ingenuities. And even
those are not so pained as to have stopped 30 critics inching to the edges
of their seats as the Birdman race entered its majestic delirium of seas,
rocks, sharks and cliffs.
* The director, writer and cast of Fear Of A Black Hat - broadly one and the
same person, Rusty Cundieff - should be despatched to Rapa Nui immediately.
It would be punishment for giving us 88 minutes of rapper phooey: a dismal
spoof documentary in the Spinal Tap tradition in which Cundieff and pals, as
the band NWH (Niggaz With Hats), strum chords and crack jokes with all the
elan of street buskers in Hell.
Major League II is worse. Charlie Sheen, Tom Berenger and the rest are back
for fun and games in the world of baseball. Since this sport is more obscure
to British audiences even than the Great Easter Island Birdman Handicap, we
are completely at sea even when we are on dry land.
In such a week you will welcome alternative choices. But can one have too
much choice? The 38th London Film Festival begins next Thursday and once
more offers a powerful argument for owning several sets of eyes and ears and
an ability to sit in three cinemas at once.
There are almost 200 feature films this year, but I have run out of ideas
for being rude about the LFF's size. If London wants its main movie event to
be an undiscriminating chaos, let it. If it wants to fill up theatres and
silt up minds with the detritus of the year's other festivals - what on
earth are films like Jiri Menzel's feeble Adventures Of Private Ivan Chonkin
and Mario Brenta's catatonic Barbabo Of The Mountains doing here? - let it.
As critics we can only stand between you and the National Film Theatre,
offering some aesthetic point duty as you swarm towards the celluloid.
Here are my Top Nine. Atom Egoyan's Exotica: a mazy mind-thriller about sex,
memory and identity. Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman: a 'Three Sisters' with
food, funny and poignant, from the maker of A Wedding Banquet. Peter
Jackson's Heavenly Creatures: artfully OTT in its recreation of a New
Zealand murder scandal. Nanni Moretti's Dear Diary: artfully UTT in its
scenes from the life of the wry director/ comedian (Rome's answer to Woody
Allen).
Louis Malle's Uncle Vanya On 42nd Street: eavesdropping on a heart-stopping
reading/rehearsal by a Broadway stage company. Anna Campion's Loaded: fine
psycho-gothic from the sister of Jane (The Piano). Mika Kaurismaki's
Tigrero: inspired docu(mocku?)mentary about filmmaking veteran Sam Fuller.
Rith Panh's Rice People: Hardyesque tale of the land from Cambodia. Tsai
Ming-Liang's Vive L'Amour: Venice Golden Lion-winning puzzle picture, witty
and erotic, about abstracted lives in semi-abstract settings.
All this and Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein to open the event. Book now
while seats and stamina last.

As part of BBC2's 'Bard On The Box' season, Michael Bogdanov organises
Shakespeare On The Estate, an exercise which sounds perilously like slumming
by Islington trendies, but we shall see. It seems that on the Ladywood
estate in Birmingham Bogdanov visits pubs, youth groups and young mothers'
centres, and ends up using a tower-block balcony for the famous Romeo and
Juliet scene (9.00). It would be hard to dream up a madder way of looking
after our health than requiring completely inexperienced doctors in their
mid-20s to work more than 100 hours a week, providing emergency cover
throughout a general hospital, including the casualty department, in shifts
lasting 24 or even 48 hours. Yet that is what happens. Inside Story watches
two junior doctors at the Middlesex/UCH complex in London (10.00 BBC1). We
know that a vestry is a place where a clergyman may keep or even change his
clothes, but is it really the place for a bishop to investigate the inside
of his secretary's blouse? That is what was happening in last week's
late-night soap, Revelations (10.40 ITV).

FT  27 OCT 94 / Arts: Occasion to celebrate - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Joanna MacGregor devised a beautifully balanced recital programme for the
Wigmore International Piano Season on Saturday and somehow charmed the
hall's notoriously lusty Steinway into gentle manners. Sceptics might say
she did not venture anything new, right down to the Thelonious Monk encore,
Round Midnight, on which she lavished as much colour as on Ravel's Miroirs
before the interval. Still, perhaps this occasion was something to celebrate
rather than an opportunity to experiment.
She began with Bach's French Suite Number Five in G major - a fluent
performance with lots of light and shade, and abundant, effortless ornaments
in the opening Allemande. Each movement sang, though she took the Courante
very fast. The Loure, with its rhythmic intricacies, slithered along
naturally, and the final Gigue raced at a speed which was exciting because
it was so neatly controlled.
In the first of Ravel's Miroirs - Noctuelles - she enjoyed caressing the
most velvety sonorities, and in the second - Oiseaux tristes - she captured
a vivid sense of tropical torpor. Une barque sur l'ocean and Alborada del
Gracioso brought out her sense of elan and flamboyance before the quiescent,
dusky tolling of the final piece, la vallee des cloches.
MacGregor is never precious, and even though Schumann once said he had put
on his 'frilly dress' to compose Kinderszenen, she took a straightforward
approach to the cycle. That was all to the good - after all, Schumann told
his pianist wife Clara she must forget she was a performer when playing the
pieces - but if the title of Gluckes genug implies no extremes of feeling,
MacGregor left it seeming rather ordinary. On the other hand, her freedom
with the pulse in Kind im Einschlummern made the process of dropping true to
life, but unnecessarily elaborate.
Seven of Chick Corea's Children's Songs made a nice sequel, as well as a
contrast. Number Four, with its pliant, melancholy tune over rocking
triplets, seemed tailored to suit MacGregor's sleek and limpid style, while
the tangy harmonies and propulsive rhythms of Number Twenty sounded closer
to Corea's jazz-rock music.
Which led neatly to MacGregor's more demanding final choice, the imposing
Sonata which Bartok wrote in 1926. The rugged fistfuls of notes and stamping
rhythms in the first movement recall the mean, but not so lean, First Piano
Concerto of the same vintage. The slow middle movement is spare and grim,
while the finale becomes a frenzied dervish dance.
It is possible to imagine performances which would have shaped the music's
angular features more acutely than MacGregor's, but still, it had plenty of
zest and probably enough harshness for most people.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Technology: Research not to be sneezed at - Scientists are
closer to finding a cure for the cold, writes Sheila Jones in a series on
drug discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES

<TEXT>
A vaccine for the common cold is a distant dream but a cure may be closer to
hand. Scientists have tried for years to fathom the mysteries of the many
viruses that cause the cold.
There have been several false dawns. The discovery in 1985 of the structure
of the rhinovirus - of which there are at least 120 out of about 200 cold
viruses - was heralded as the breakthrough that might produce a vaccine.
Some researchers said at the time, however, that its very complexity meant a
vaccine was probably impossible.
Yet, it was a breakthrough. It meant scientists could begin to think about
designing a drug that might stop the virus.
Nearly 10 years on, there is no new drug that does more than alleviate cough
and cold symptoms. Drugs are becoming more sophisticated, but none prevents
infection.
Now, there is another breakthrough. In March this year, Agouron
Pharmaceuticals, a small US company, announced it had discovered the atomic
structure of rhinovirus 3C protease (RVP), an enzyme that plays a vital role
in the lifecycle of the rhinovirus. The RVP enzyme helps the virus to do its
work as it enters the body (through the nose, eyes or mouth), producing the
symptoms associated with colds.
'It is probably the most important breakthrough since the structure of the
virus was discovered in 1985,' according to Jeffrey Almond, microbiology
professor at the University of Reading, one of the main centres of research
in the UK into the common cold.
Agouron believes the discovery will enable it to design a drug, atom by
atom, that will lock into the enzyme and inhibit or stop rhinovirus
replication. It sounds familiar, but there are some differences.
First, every virus and rhinovirus would need its own vaccine because each is
minutely different: Agouron believes the enzyme structure is common, or
similar, to at least the rhinoviruses. If it can design a drug to fit the
RVP enzyme, it could reach half of all colds.
Second, Agouron, in common with several other pharmaceutical companies, is
working with computerised drug design. Computing tools can provide important
leads in the search for the right atom to create a molecule that locks on to
a virus. The chances of hitting the right combination are greater because
scientists can try out any number of combinations more swiftly than they
could 10 years ago.
Agouron says it hopes to have a drug in the development phase by next year,
although it will be 'some years' before such a drug would be on the market.
Drugs go through years of clinical trials before they are allowed on to the
market, whether for prescription or over-the-counter sale. Initially,
Agouron plans to develop agents for treatment of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.
Agouron is not alone in the race to design a drug to kill the cold. Agouron
provided Eli Lilly, the US company, with the RVP structure in exchange for
commercial rights to anti-HIV agents produced jointly by the two companies.
Also in the picture are Japan Tobacco, the main contributor of funds for
Agouron's anti-viral research, and Syntex, a US subsidiary of Roche of
Switzerland, which is also contributing. JT has contributed Dollars 56m
(Pounds 35m) to the collaboration in the past three to four years, in
exchange for a licensing and profit-sharing arrangement. Any other company,
Agouron acknowledges, could establish the enzyme structure and design a
prophylactic drug.
Yet all researchers are aiming at an extremely difficult target, says David
Tyrell, a virologist who ran the common colds research unit at Salisbury in
the UK for 26 years until its closure in 1990. 'You need to produce
something that will kill the virus but won't also damage the delicate nerves
and tissue in the nose or cause irritation that is worse than the cold,'
says Tyrell. He points to the early optimism about interferon in the
mid-1980s. The first experiments showed that it stopped the cold but it
produced unacceptable side-effects, including nasal damage.
As the world waits for a cure, the OTC coughs and colds industry is
constantly upgrading and refining its products. Nearly two-thirds of cold
sufferers seek self-medication in a global market worth about Pounds 3.5bn a
year.
The trend in the industry is to improve what is already available. Most
cough and cold remedies contain an analgesic, such as paracetamol or
aspirin, plus one or more active ingredients to control specific symptoms.
These include decongestants such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine and
sedative antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and promethazine, to
suppress coughing and to dry a runny nose.
The industry has sought to target specific symptoms, to improve tastes and
delivery systems, to speed up and prolong treatment effectiveness, and to
produce better and safer packaging.
The industry has also produced new mixes with drugs coming off prescription
and on to the OTC market. Two years ago, the antihistamine Tavist, developed
by Sandoz of Switzerland, switched from prescription to OTC and is now an
ingredient in the company's cough and cold remedies.
Boehringer Ingelheim, which leads the German market, says it is focusing on
switching more prescription-only drugs to the OTC market following the move
to OTC of its Bisolvon cough treatment, which sells about DM245m (Pounds
102m) annually, DM45m of which is prescription-based.
Crookes Healthcare, the UK division of Boots Healthcare International,
launched ibuprofen, the analgesic, anti-pyretic (lowers temperature) and
anti-inflammatory drug onto the OTC market in 1983 as Nurofen. This year,
the company produced a new formulation - Nurofen Cold &amp; Flu tablets - the
first specific cold treatment sold OTC containing ibuprofen. The product's
other active ingredient is the decongestant pseudoephedrine. P&amp;G is also
launching in the US a patented formula in its Vicks range which is
ibuprofen-based and contains a decongestant.
Procter &amp; Gamble's recent repackaging of some products is typical of moves
under way elsewhere in the industry. P&amp;G's new Accutip packaging for its
cough products restricts the amount of liquid leaving the bottle, and
SmithKline Beecham has recently repackaged its top-selling Contac line of
cold remedies. Johnson &amp; Johnson has introduced the Tylenol FastCap, a
bottle cap that opens with a slight twist. It is aimed at elderly or
arthritic people and households without young children. Improved delivery
systems in recent years include easy-to-swallow gelatin capsules and
day/night tablets of drowsy and non-drowsy cold formulas in one package.
The market, dominated globally by a handful of international groups, is also
trying to produce better-tasting remedies, such as SmithKline's range of
Beecham powders for hot drinks containing honey and lemon. Reckitt &amp; Colman,
of the UK, now produces a range of its leading Lemsip brand, with drowsy and
non-drowsy formulas, capsules and flu strength. The company says more Lemsip
products, with known pharmaceutical agents, are being developed.
Leaders in the global coughs and colds OTC market are P&amp;G, which has about a
15 per cent share, according to industry estimates; Warner Wellcome, the
Anglo-American joint venture between Warner Lambert of the US (which
produces Benylin) and Wellcome of the UK (which makes Sudafed) with 14 per
cent; American Home Products, with about 8 per cent, and SmithKline Beecham,
which has a 4.5 per cent share (this is expected to rise to about 7 per cent
when details of SB's recent acquisition of Sterling Health are finalised).
None of the leading pharmaceuticals companies is betting on a cure, but all
are reshaping, repackaging and remixing. 'The goal is to get a cure,'
according to P&amp;G, 'but before you get there, you have to try to improve
what's available now.'
A six-part series on cancer research will start on the Technology Page next
month. The drug discovery series will resume next summer.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Technology: New light on road safety - European car makers
are using pioneering techniques
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's motor industry has developed
a system which could sharply reduce road deaths, according to European car
manufacturers.
The technology, which involves the use of ultra-violet light in headlamps,
was developed under the Prometheus research programme and could be ready by
the end of this decade.
About 50,000 people are killed and around 1m injured each year on roads in
Europe. With a view to reducing the toll, and solving another of the
problems bedevilling Europe's roads - traffic congestion - 90 cars and
trucks fitted with an assortment of pioneering technologies were put through
their paces at a Paris conference last week.
They were demonstrating the fruits of Prometheus, the first pan-European
collaborative research project, which involves 13 vehicle manufacturers and
some of their key component suppliers, plus electronics and defence
equipment producers, research institutes and universities.
Prometheus - an acronym for Programme for a European Traffic with Highest
Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety - is eight years old and has cost nearly
Ecu900m (Pounds 703m).
The UV system, developed by Saab and Volvo, was demonstrated by Saab last
week. At an unlit test track near Paris last week, the Saab 9000 showed only
a hint of UV light from two small lamps at bumper level. But for the driver,
the UV transformed the view. White lines and road signs treated with
UV-responsive paint shone out from hundreds of yards ahead.
Apart from safety, there is another dimension to the programme. Europe's
vehicle makers are locked in a fierce race with rivals in Japan and North
America to develop new technologies expected to transform vehicles and road
infrastructure by the 21st century.
At stake are vast rewards for those whose technologies become the industry
standard in areas such as vision enhancement, automatic collision avoidance,
and data interchange between vehicles and roadside equipment for purposes
such as route finding and automatic tolling.
The Prometheus research has fallen into three categories: safer driving,
mainly through autonomous on-board systems; 'co-operative' driving,
involving information exchanges between vehicles or roadside information
beacons; and broader traffic management technology.
The UV system falls into the first category. Jaguar, glass manufacturer
Pilkington and GEC Marconi Avionics have taken a different approach,
adapting military technology. A near-infra-red camera and filtered headlamps
allow the driver to see into pitch-black countryside. Infra-red, unlike UV,
can also cut through fog.
Jaguar also demonstrated an 'intelligent' cruise control car, developed with
Philips, Lucas Industries, Alfred Teves and DASA, which measures the
distance and speed of vehicles ahead, maintaining a safe distance by
automatic braking and throttle. The driver can override the system.
Lucas, and Oxford and Southampton universities, has joined Jaguar to develop
a vision system using a video camera and radar sensors to scan the road
ahead and predict collision risk. BMW, Matra, Renault and Jaguar have also
developed systems which help the driver stay in lane using a camera which
recognises lane markings.
Collectively, the Prometheus technology stands to change driving and safety
standards beyond recognition in the next two decades - if motorists are
prepared to pay extra for safety features.
If Prometheus succeeds in its goals, the 50,000 annual death toll could be
halved by 2010.

Colin Fraser, 49, chief executive of McGregor Cory, the contract
distribution business of Ocean, has resigned, and will be leaving the group
by mutual agreement at the end of the month. Fraser was also a main board
director of Ocean, the freight, environmental and marine services group
which has continued to disappoint the City.
John Allan, who became chief executive of the group last month, said
yesterday that he would be taking a personal role in McGregor Cory as
executive chairman. Significant investments had been made in the business,
and he aimed to accelerate the rate of return to shareholders.
Fraser, whose total emoluments last year were Pounds 113,000, was on a
three-year rolling contract. Compensation is still being discussed.
Allan said there were no plans to change any other executive directors at
the moment.

<TEXT>
Mike Grant, 41, a former Laing &amp; Cruickshank stockbroker, has taken over as
group treasurer of Eurotunnel where he will be responsible for managing the
group's Pounds 8bn debt and relations with its 220 banks.
Grant, who joined Eurotunnel in 1987 and is a member of the association of
corporate treasurers, is taking charge of an expanded department following
Eurotunnel's decision to merge its treasurer's and corporate finance
departments.
The former has been responsible for areas such as the management of the
group's interest rate and foreign exchange exposure and the corporate
finance department has been concerned with bank negotiations, financial
analysis and equity issues.
Now that Eurotunnel has raised the bulk of its capital, the group is
consolidating its financial side under Graham Corbett, the chief financial
officer. Peter Ratzer, 55, currently director of corporate finance, is
becoming a senior financial adviser before taking early retirement towards
the middle of 1995 and Patrick Fulhaber, 48, who has been treasurer since
1991, is returning to France.
Grant, who was corporate finance manager, will also take over responsibility
for the bank and investor relations department in his new role.

FT  27 OCT 94 / People: Peugeot's UK steering wheel to remain in British
hands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Geoffrey Whalen, who as chief executive of Peugeot Talbot has overseen a
renaissance of the French car-maker's UK subsidiary during the past 11
years, is to leave the company at the end of the year, though he will remain
on the board in a non-executive capacity.
The parting is said to be entirely amicable and the powers-that-be at
Peugeot's group headquarters in Paris are content to leave Peugeot Talbot's
operations in another English pair of hands. Whalen's successor is to be his
long-serving aide Richard Parham (far right), ten years Whalen's junior, who
has been assistant MD at Ryton since 1981 - initially under Whalen's own
predecessor, the late Sir George Turnbull.
'The initiative is entirely mine,' stresses Whalen (right), whose angular,
bespectacled and often suede-shoed appearance gives him more the demeanour
of a university don than a motor magnate. 'There have been no rows, no
disputes - we now have a good facility and a good future at Ryton (the car
plant near Coventry); I'm nearly 59 and now is a good time to leave and go
and do something different.'
What that something will be Whalen is not yet prepared to say - 'except that
I don't have any intentions of going off to run a rival car company'.
Whalen is such a motor industry institution - he has twice been president of
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders and is currently its deputy
president - that it tends to be forgotten that he cut his career teeth not
on motor cars but in the coal industry. He worked in industrial relations
for the National Coal Board for seven years before joining first motor
components group AC Delco, then British Leyland and - after a brief spell
with food group Ranks Hovis McDougall - Peugeot Talbot, as personnel
director, in 1980.
The Peugeot Talbot Whalen joined was a very different animal from today's.
It was then mired in losses which would total nearly Pounds 400m over almost
a decade before the financial turnround - a Pounds 3.1m net profit - came in
1984.
Since then it has been profitable for all but one of the past ten years,
with its UK market share jumping from just over 1 per cent to the current 8
per cent. Car production over the same period rose from 20,000 a year to a
peak 100,000-plus, with around 90,000 expected next year.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The hunt for a
classic - This year's UK Advertising Effectiveness Awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new advertising campaign is launched and, as a result, sales surge. Rarely
is life that simple, as this year's winning entries for the UK's Advertising
Effectiveness Awards, unveiled on Tuesday, demonstrate.
The awards, unlike the thousands of other trophies the advertising industry
loves to bestow on itself each year, are not for creative excellence,
artistic merit, brilliance of execution or originality of concept.
Instead, the biennial awards, organised by the Institute of Practitioners in
Advertising, are given for case histories, often laden with dry statistics,
which succeed in demonstrating how an advertising campaign has contributed
to a product or service's commercial success.
This year's overall winner - Tim Broadbent at WCRS, for his study of the
agency's advertising for BMW over the last 15 years - illustrates the
complexity of evaluating effectiveness when there is no 'big bang' of a new
campaign.
As Broadbent points out: 'New advertising can give a sudden twitch to the
needles of research dials, which makes it easier to demonstrate how changes
in consumer attitudes coincide with changes in sales.' By contrast, his job
was to convince the judges that consistency of message over time was the
essence of the agency's success in its advertising for BMW.
When BMW (GB) was established in 1979 to take over from the previous
distributor, it set objectives of maintaining high profit margins while
trebling sales by 1990 from 13,000 new cars a year to 40,000. These
objectives have been achieved and BMW in Britain has outperformed the
market, thanks partly, argues Broadbent, to WCRS's 'ultimate driving
machine' campaign which has run throughout the whole period.
By using comparisons with BMW's performance in other European markets, he
picks off factors such as price, distribution and product improvements which
could have accounted for BMW's outstanding sales growth in Britain.
Broadbent's calculation is that advertising expenditure of Pounds 91m since
1979 has helped to generate approximately Pounds 3bn in extra sales during
that time. 'The value of BMW's brand-building campaign seems beyond
question,' he concludes.
The essence of the advertising has been a consistent tone of voice, with the
car as the master of each ad. Says the case study: 'There are few humans or
signs of humans, because humanity can suggest fallibility, whereas BMWs are
shown as precise, cold, technical icons with jewel-like perfection.' There
are no contrivances 'to add superficial glamour, such as stately homes,
sunsets or glamorous blondes'.
It is difficult to imagine anything further from the BMW world than
Boddingtons, the beer billed as the 'cream of Manchester'. The case study of
Boddingtons' advertising, by Guy Murphy at agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty, won
the category for products or services which are new, or have no significant
history of advertising.
When Whitbread bought the Boddingtons brewery in Manchester in 1989 it was
faced with the task of transforming the bitter into a national brand without
alienating its existing regional drinkers. Exploiting its attribute of being
creamy-looking when poured, BBH focused on the product, rather than the user
 -a more common tactic in the advertising of bitter brands. The agency also
avoided the traps of regional stereotyping. The campaign that was developed
strongly linked product appearance to product delivery - the creamy
appearance to smooth taste.
The agency rejected television advertising to launch the campaign, deciding,
instead, on targeted press advertising which would reach 'premium' beer
drinkers. The outside back covers of magazines, in particular, were used to
build up awareness. It was only after two years that TV advertising was
added, as Whitbread gradually built up its advertising spending on
Boddingtons from Pounds 1.8m in 1991 to Pounds 4.5m last year.
The brand, which includes Canned Boddingtons, as well as Boddingtons Bitter,
has grown three-fold since its acquisition and is now the UK's fourth
largest bitter brand. Like the BMW case history, the Boddingtons study works
through the factors which have had an effect on the brand's growth and
attempts to single out and value advertising's contribution.
This value emerges as 6.1 per cent of total sales, which Whitbread confirms
more than clears the cost of the campaign in the short term, while laying
the foundations for the long-term success of the brand.
Chris Baker, planning director of agency Bainsfair Sharkey Trott, who was
convenor of the judges, says the BMW and Boddingtons campaigns were 'major
marketing successes in which the decisive role of advertising has been
clearly demonstrated' and both were characterised by a high degree of
originality in strategy and execution.
BMW won the day because of its 'sustained success and consistent
implementation' over 15 years, said Baker. The cream of Manchester will have
to wait until the end of the millennium to see if it has achieved classic
advertising status.
A pull-out with all the award winning case studies was published with
yesterday's FT.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Audit rivals contest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The normally peaceful world of auditing magazine circulations, the key
currency for advertising, is being disturbed by the first stirrings of
serious competition.
BPA International, the US-based body responsible for auditing the
circulations of more than 1,600 magazines, mostly in the US, is increasingly
moving into Europe, and the UK in particular.
The organisation already serves 67 magazines in the UK but has now set up a
European sales and marketing office, much to the irritation of the official
British audit body the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Both BPA and the ABC
are non-profit making bodies.
Joseph Foley, BPA's international director, believes he is bringing extra
choice and higher standards of verification to the UK marketplace, at a time
when publications are becoming more international.
BPA says it provides detailed information on who a magazine goes to in terms
of job title, something that is not part of the standard ABC audit.
John Beadell, chief executive of the ABC, says his procedures are among the
most stringent in the world, certainly comparable to those of the BPA and
that more detailed information was introduced with the ABC Profile in 1991.
'There's not going to be a war. It would damage the integrity of circulation
audits,' he says.
Organisations such as the Periodical Publishers Association believe
advertisers, agencies and publishers want a single currency for comparing
magazine circulation in the UK and it should be the ABC.
'Two competing currencies in the same marketplace must devalue both through
undermining confidence,' Ian Locks, chief executive of the PPA, says.
He fears the next stage in the competition will mean players having to buy
both sets of data - thereby doubling the cost.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Men on the
supermarket shelf - Advertisers neglect the reality of home life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW BATSTONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The reality is a nation with the highest divorce rate in the EU, 31 per cent
of births outside marriage and a fifth of children raised by single parents.
Yet despite the fact that men are forced to run their domestic affairs as
never before, images of smiling, 30-something British housewives still
dominate advertising for grocery products.
Men living alone represent 11 per cent of UK households, and even within the
family the conventional role of woman as housewife is being eroded.
While women continue to do most of the household tasks, men no longer escape
the chores as they used to, according to a survey carried out by the Henley
Centre for the supermarket group Asda. Men shop for an average of two and a
half hours a week, against an average of four for women.
The Henley survey suggests that 38 per cent of men claim to have personally
selected more than half of the items they had bought from supermarkets.
Twenty six per cent of men claim actually to enjoy shopping and a
stereotype-defying 46 per cent say that cooking is a real pleasure.
When men shop they are more likely to buy brands and spend on average 5 per
cent more than their female counterparts - on the face of it a
manufacturer's dream.
Donald Kerr, planning director at the advertising agency J. Walter Thompson,
believes that an opportunity is being missed because 'conventional thinking
views women as the housewife. Many companies still see women in their
pre-new man role'. He attributes this partly to attitudes created by the
recession, which have left a culture of caution among Britain's marketing
community. But his main contention is that 'many marketers and advertising
executives don't take their home to work'.
If they remembered the reality of their own homes while wearing their suits,
many of Britain's brands could have a very different orientation.
Such suggestions are dismissed by Jerry Wright, marketing director at Lever
Brothers, a company with a large portfolio of grocery brands.
'The bulk of our brands are targeted at women, who still do the bulk of
shopping,' he says, 'but we do pick up a lot of men with our advertising.'
Wright concedes, however, that men represent a valuable franchise for
grocery manufacturers. 'I think there is a feeling that men are more likely
to buy brands, because they have less knowledge and feel less sure of
themselves than women.'
Wright believes men can be victims of a kind of commercial Oedipus complex.
'They are often tempted to buy the brands their mother used to use,' he
says.
Even so Lever Brothers has not tried to develop a niche, male-oriented
grocery brand and the company has not even carried out any specific research
into this opportunity. 'The needs of men as consumers of washing powder, for
instance, are not distinct enough,' says Wright, 'although you might argue
that young men would be interested in a heavy soiling product, because they
play more sport.'
Wright believes most grocery brands are sufficiently accessible to men.
'Most brands in this category don't say too much about you as a person, so
buying one with a feminine image would not give the majority of men a
problem.'
Lever Brothers' rival Procter and Gamble is currently screening an
advertisement showing a man cleaning the kitchen floor for his wife. A sign
perhaps that advertisers must increasingly reflect life as it is, rather
than recreating the kind of scenes that were looking dated even in the
1950s.

FT  27 OCT 94 / The Local Government Commission: Cost of Pounds 8m council
study angers critics / A look at whether spending on the review paid off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Banham said yesterday that the Local Government Commission's Pounds
8m budget for this year was 'money well spent'. Many disagree with him.
Labour yesterday described the commission's review of local authority
structure as 'a waste of time and money', while Professor Michael Clarke of
Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government Studies said the
'entire remit the commission was given was flawed'.
Sir John argued that by consulting widely and expensively - with
questionnaires sent to every household in the areas for which proposals were
announced yesterday - the commission had avoided what could have been
'unpopular expensive mistakes' in six counties.
'If we had pressed ahead with our recommendations without listening to local
people we would be recommending transitional costs of the order of Pounds
135m,' he said.
Sir John added that the commission's Pounds 8m budget was spread over 32
counties, so reviewing each had cost only about Pounds 250,000. This was
'minuscule' compared with the overall annual English local government budget
of about Pounds 40bn.
Prof Clarke described this argument as 'incredible' and said it would have
been better not to spend any money at all.
Critics of the review also pointed out that Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, last year proposed to abandon the review except in counties where
a sizeable proportion of local residents signed petitions asking for change.
This could have averted all expenditure by the commission in counties such
as Oxfordshire, where substantial opposition to change was found.
The costs of the review go beyond the commission's own budget. According to
Prof Clarke, long-term planning in the shire counties and districts had been
virtually shelved for the last two years as local authorities devoted all
their energies to the review.
The financial cost in terms of lost opportunities was 'if not incalculable,
then certainly enormous', he said. Councils had been attempting to introduce
the council tax and prepare for compulsory competitive tendering of
white-collar services.
Officials of the national local authority associations say the review has
taken up 'at least 95 per cent' of their time, while work on other topics
has been abandoned.
Further, both districts and counties have launched expensive publicity
campaigns of their own. Districts claim that county councils such as Essex
and Nottinghamshire spent as much as Pounds 150,000 on publicity campaigns
about the review, and have made official complaints to the Audit Commission,
the watchdog for local government expenditure.
Sir John's commission has also complained about districts' expenditure. For
example, in Derbyshire, one of the first counties to be reviewed, all the
districts hired consultants to advise on their public relations strategy in
dealing with the review, while all the district councils in Surrey hired
CSL, the managed services division of Touche Ross, to help prepare their
submission on the review.
Several counties recommended for abolition earlier in the process have
sought judicial review of the decisions, at a cost of around Pounds 100,000
each. The High Court has rejected every attempt so far to overturn the
commission's recommendations, but the attempts continue. Humberside said
yesterday that it would seek judicial review of Mr Gummer's announcement
that it should be abolished.
In those areas where Sir John recommended change yesterday, he believes
there will be a big bill, which must eventually be paid by local council-tax
payers. In total, he estimates the cost of reorganising Bedfordshire,
Buckinghamshire and Hampshire at between Pounds 27m and Pounds 35m. Also,
reorganisation will create additional annual costs of between Pounds 2m and
Pounds 12m.
Sir John said: 'Any reorganisation costs more and delivers less than its
proponents suggest.' Prof Clarke agreed, saying the 'overwhelming' evidence
from previous reorganisations was that setting up new authorities would
cause high transitional costs which could not be recovered by later annual
savings.
Business leaders share these concerns. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of
the Confederation of British Industry, described the reorganisation as an
'expensive' hobby for the government.
But the cross-party Association of District Councils refuses to slacken its
own lobbying effort, and has asked for an 'urgent' meeting with the prime
minister.
The association wants the government to reject the commission's proposals.
That would mean requiring the commission to start its review again from
scratch. Yesterday, there was little or no sign of political support for
such a move.

FT  27 OCT 94 / The Local Government Commission: Plans to axe six counties
abandoned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Banham signals rejection of unitary authorities; Labour says government
policy in turmoil
Sir John Banham, chairman of the Local Government Commission, yesterday
announced that plans to abolish six county councils - Cambridgeshire,
Cheshire, Cumbria, Kent, Lancashire and Oxfordshire - had been abandoned.
The announcement signals a decisive rejection of the government's original
preference that county councils should be replaced by unitary authorities
combining the powers of counties and districts in all bar 'exceptional'
circumstances.
Of the 17 counties for which proposals have been announced so far, 10 will
keep the two-tier system at least in part. Proposals for the other shire
counties will be given to the government by the end of the year, and few are
likely to involve a unitary structure.
Sir John's proposals followed the decision of Mr John Gummer, the
environment secretary, not to proceed with plans to restructure Somerset and
North Yorkshire. Mr Gummer has the power to ask the commission to reconsider
its proposals, but seems unlikely to use it.
Opposition politicians said the government's policy was in chaos. Mr Frank
Dobson, shadow environment secretary, said: 'The present position is yet
another monument to government incompetence. Turmoil and trouble, all for
nothing - a useless distraction.'
The commission has proposed a change to the structure of Hampshire, with
Portsmouth, Southampton and the New Forest district councils all given
unitary status on their current boundaries. The proposals for the two cities
were widely predicted, but the New Forest unitary was a surprise.
Sir John said the commission's opinion survey in the area had shown
overwhelming support for a unitary authority independent of Hampshire, with
60 per cent of residents in favour of this option.
In Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, Sir John recommended more radical
change - the abolition of both county councils and unitary status for most
of the lower-tier district councils on their current boundaries.
Milton Keynes, Aylesbury Vale and Wycombe in Bucks will all be unitary, with
a new merged South Buckinghamshire authority created by linking the existing
Chiltern and South Bucks councils.
Mr David Rendel, Liberal Democrat local government spokesman, said this
would mean abolishing the one county council still controlled by the
Conservatives after their bad showing in last year's local elections.
Bedfordshire will be split into three unitaries, rather than the two
originally recommended, with unitary status for Luton and Bedford.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: Pollution report poses
stiff challenge for ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution, was keen to stress yesterday that his report was in tune with the
government's desire for a sustainable transport policy.
On the face of it, that is true. Earlier this year Mr John Major launched a
weighty document on sustainable development which spoke of the need 'to
strike the right balance between the ability of transport to serve economic
development and the ability to protect the environment and sustain future
quality of life'.
But the government has so far done little to put that policy into practice.
Cynics would even say that those fine words bear little relation to actual
policy, which is dominated by favouritism for the car and a desire to
shuffle off the problems of public transport by privatising it.
Yesterday's report is therefore a challenge to ministers to match words with
deeds. But it goes further than that by urging a fundamental reshaping of
the economics of transport to bring out its true costs.
Professor Richard Macrory, a commission member and a barrister, described
the report as 'a last chance' for the Department of Transport to become 'a
real transport department' rather than just a roads department. 'Many people
in evidence to us said the department was biased towards roads. We feel that
is correct.'
Small surprise, therefore, that ministers gave the report a guarded welcome
yesterday. It puts pressure on the government on several fronts.
One is taxation. Although Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is committed to
raising the price of vehicle fuel by 5 per cent a year, the commission wants
that rate to be doubled.
The Treasury would no doubt welcome an opportunity to raise more revenue.
But the closer the government moves to a general election, the less likely
such a measure looks, particularly since the commission admits: 'We
recognise that the policies we recommend will impose costs on the present
generation.' Though it adds they could be offset by cuts in other taxes.
Another is the balance between public and private transport. Although the
government is showing signs of soft-pedalling its roads programme, it has
done little to compensate by boosting public transport. The commission does
not challenge the wisdom of privatising trains and buses, but it urges a
heavy commitment of public funds to develop public transport.
Interestingly, it expresses reservations about one of the few measures the
government is proposing to jack up the cost of motoring: motorway tolls.
Commission members fear this will only divert heavy traffic to smaller roads
less capable of handling it.
A further challenge raised by the report is its implication that road travel
is far too cheap. Could the economy sustain a sharp increase in transport
costs? What would happen to industry if some of the commission's
recommendations on freight transport were adopted - for example, halting the
strengthening of road bridges and banning big lorries from city centres?
The government has been reluctant to land industry with environmental
charges for fear of damaging competitiveness, and it has been vociferous in
its opposition to Brussels' plans for a carbon tax.
Even so, Sir Geoffrey Allen, one of the few industrialists on the
commission, believes industry can cope. 'There's lots of flexibility in the
system,' he said yesterday. 'Companies will react and find other ways of
moving their goods.'
The report also anticipates objections from the industrial lobby that its
recommendations would damage the vehicle manufacturing and road building
industries.
'There will be alternative work in providing improved infrastructure for
public transport, such as new light rail systems or upgraded railway lines,'
it says. For the automobile and freight industries, the challenge lies in
developing new eco-friendly vehicles.
On the planning front, the commission believes greater account should be
taken of environmental considerations when planning transport routes.
The report pointedly contains a colour picture of Twyford Down, an area of
outstanding natural beauty which the Department of Transport authorised in
1991 to be destroyed in order to extend the M3. Although there have been
signs of a more balanced approach since then, the government is not known
for its care of the natural environment.
One respect in which the government will welcome the report is that it lends
support to its efforts to curb atmospheric pollution.
At the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, the UK signed a treaty committing it to try to
bring carbon dioxide emissions back to 1990 levels by the year 2000. A big
contribution to achieving this goal will have to come from transport.
Therefore any recommendations to curb vehicle exhaust will be good news, at
least for Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary.
The commission is aware that its recommendations will be tough for the
government, and will create divisions among departments, for example between
environment and trade and industry over raising the cost of transport for
industry. But, as the report points out, policymakers failed to bite the
bullet when these issues arose 20 years ago.
It says: 'It is a truly daunting prospect that, if the present opportunity
were also to be lost, our successors would again be debating the increasing
effects of road transport on the environment in the 2010s, following 20 more
years of environmental deterioration.'

FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: Business slams heavy
burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business and motoring organisations criticised the report for suggesting
measures which would place too heavy a burden on drivers and the haulage
industry.
The Confederation of British Industry warned that the proposal to raise fuel
duty and cut road spending would do little to reduce road congestion - but
would damage British competitiveness.
The confederation said the present roads programme had to be maintained if
the UK was to overcome years of neglect and catch up with its competitors
elsewhere in Europe.
'The fear is that the short-sharp-shock treatment proposed by the commission
will make road transport very expensive but offer little in terms of
realistic alternative ways for individuals to travel and for businesses to
transport their goods and services,' said Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general.
The Freight Transport Association, which represents 12,000 hauliers and
shippers, described the report as 'unrealistic and potentially damaging to
the economy'. Increasing fuel duty would increase inflation instead of
transferring freight to rail, it said.
A high-quality environment depended on a strong, competitive economy which
would not be achieved by pricing traffic off the roads, warned the British
Roads Federation, which represents many companies that ship goods by road.
It called for higher investment to remove through traffic from towns and
villages.
The Automobile Association said private motorists were being faced with
penalties to force them to leave their cars 'for non-existent or inadequate
alternatives'. It called for improvements to public transport before
motorists could be expected to leave their cars behind. Four out of five
drivers would continue to use their cars even if the price of petrol were
doubled over the next 10 years, an AA survey has showed.
The Royal Automobile Club said the fuel-price mechanism was 'a crude, cruel
and ineffective lever' which would hit the elderly, the disabled, women, and
people living in the country the hardest.
However, Transport 2000, a campaign group in favour of public transport,
backed the report. It called on the government to use the Budget to make the
switch from roads spending to devoting resources to trains, buses, cycling
and traffic-calming measures.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: 'Impossible'
improvement to fuel efficiency rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The motor industry yesterday rejected as 'technically impossible' one of the
commission's main recommendations - that fuel efficiency of the typical
family car should be increased by 40 per cent over the next 11 years.
It also insisted that the commission's depiction of roads jammed with up to
48m vehicles by the year 2025 - double the present number - was misleading.
'We agree that car ownership will increase but this does not necessarily
mean that usage will do the same,' the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders said.
Mr Roger King of the society said: 'In the next century we will see more
families with perhaps three cars for different reasons - an electric vehicle
for city use, an inter-city car and a weekend leisure vehicle. But they will
not be all on the road at the same time.'
The industry also expressed concern at the commission's proposals to modify
further the Inland Revenue's new company-car tax regime, to abolish mileage
thresholds and increase taxation of the private fuel benefit 'to remove the
incentives for environmentally damaging behaviour'.
Business cars now account for 70 per cent of the UK new-car market. Any
significant shrinkage of the business car market could have adverse
implications for Britain as a car manufacturing base, the industry warned.
There was less concern over the call for a ban on the sale of super-unleaded
petrol because of its high content of benzene and other octane-boosting
'aromatics' linked with cancers.
In spite of claims that a 40 per cent improvement in fuel efficiency is
technically impossible, something close to that could be achieved - but at
what the industry believes would be an unacceptable penalty for the
consumer.
For every 10 per cent reduction in a car's weight an improvement of roughly
7 per cent in fuel consumption is obtained.
A weight reduction of about one-third, most industry engineers maintain,
could be achieved by using aluminium or lightweight steel bodies and
dispensing with complex accessories such as stereos and electric windows.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: Green groups hail hope
of victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The report was enthusiastically welcomed by environmental groups, which saw
it as potentially a breakthrough in their campaign for greener transport
policies.
Greenpeace described it as 'a watershed in the battle against subsidised
pollution', and the Council for the Protection of Rural England said the
report showed 'vision'.
The report was also welcomed by campaigners for cleaner air and a reduction
in asthma, now widely linked to transport pollution.
After some notorious battles over new road schemes, the report's emphasis on
the 'best practicable environmental option' will encourage green groups to
take a more aggressive stance on future plans.
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said that 160 sites of special
scientific interest were directly at risk from the roads programme, and that
wildlife was suffering from polluting emissions.
The environmental lobby will be pressing for action to curb the roads
programme; greater taxation to make road transport bear the full costs of
the environmental damage it causes; and promotion of alternative means of
transport, including new technology; and better facilities for cyclists and
pedestrians.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Royal Commission on the Environment: Heated debate warmed
further - The details of the commission's proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a measure of the depth of the commission's research andits radical
proposals that, for all the leaks which preceded its publication, its report
still impressed observers with the strength and breadth of its arguments.
Industry yesterday rejected the proposals to increase the cost of road use
and reduce spending and it is unlikely to accept the commission's costings
of its proposals. But the report's findings can be expected to make an
important contribution to the increasingly heated discussion of the
environment and the car.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, responded with a call for 'a
national debate about whether we are prepared for the costs and changes in
our transport habits that will result'.
The commission has no doubts about the scale of the problem to be solved.
'Pollutants from vehicles are the prime cause of poor air quality that
damages human health, plants and the fabric of buildings,' it says.
'Noise from vehicles and aircraft is a major source of stress. The transport
system must already be regarded as unsustainable. We believe this is . . .
of such importance that it justifies placing significant restraints on the
future evolution of the transport system.'
Hitherto most of the environmental costs have fallen on the community rather
than the users or builders of the transport system, the report says. The
true costs must become more apparent at the point of use through increases
in fuel prices and perhaps, later, through road pricing.
But planning policies, too, must seek to bring about a shift away from
lifestyles which depend on the extensive use of cars.
One effective way of changing policies and public behaviour is to set
targets, for example, to reduce vehicle emissions, road accidents or
increases in rail use. These targets become the framework for more detailed
strategies.
The commission's detailed proposals to improve air quality so that it fully
meets World Health Organisation guidelines by 2005 include tougher annual
MoT tests of emission levels; collaboration between the government and the
oil industry to develop cleaner fuels, and encouragement for the use of
natural gas and electric-powered vehicles.
To cut carbon dioxide emissions it wants tougher targets to be set and
higher duty to be levied. This will encourage car manufacturers to design
cleaner cars and motorists to buy them. The tax rules for company cars
should be modified to reduce incentives to drive long distances.
The commission recommends creating more passenger transport authorities,
including one for London. Developers could be charged for the environmental
costs of any traffic their projects generated.
Transport assessments must weigh roads against a public-transport
alternative and not merely seek the most effective road scheme. Trunk-road
planning, now treated separately from local road networks, should be
integrated to give local authorities better control of the entire road
network in their area.
Greater protection must be given to land with a low economic value but with
a high value in conservation, cultural or scenic terms. If such land is
needed for road-building, the developer must provide an equivalent area for
public use, the report says.
Much of the report looks at the impact of the private car on the environment
 -but lorries have, if anything, a disproportionate impact. Freight
shipments should be taken off the roads and rail's share of the freight
market should rise from 6.5 per cent to 20 per cent by 2010, it says.
There are already grants to encourage commercial users to move to rail, but
they are small and may need to be increased or backed up with other
measures, the commission says.
To reduce car use in towns more bus lanes should be provided and new tram
systems encouraged. Parking strategies should reduce use of private cars and
networks of safe cycle routes must be developed. Restrictions should be
placed on lorries of more than 17 tonnes in town centres.
Most of the commission's proposals relate to surface transport but a section
on aviation recommends the introduction on a Europe-wide basis of a levy on
airline fuel to reflect the environmental damage caused. More stringent
noise standards should be brought in for new aircraft.
The commission estimates that the increases in fuel prices and the other
measures would limit the growth of passenger and freight transport to about
10 per cent a decade, the maximum level which can be sustained without
damaging the environment.
Without the entire package of measures, fuel prices would have had to have
been increased even more sharply, the commission warns. But this would be
unfair and probably less effective. As it is, lower-paid people, who often
do not own cars, should benefit from improvements in public transport.
'There is now an opportunity to take the difficult policy decisions which
will lead . . . to a sustainable system of transport,' the report says.

FT  27 OCT 94 / US groups join cable TV bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition is intensifying in the battle for the UK's largest cable
franchise to be advertised so far - the 530,000 homes of Northern Ireland.
TeleWest, the largest UK cable company, which intends to float on the London
Stock Exchange before Christmas, is already planning a bid for the Northern
Ireland 'local delivery licence', as cable franchises are now called.
A consortium is being put together by TeleWest - a joint venture between TCI
of Denver, the largest cable operator in the US, and US West, the regional
telephone company. It is likely to include both Mr Tony O'Reilly's
Independent Newspapers of Ireland and RTE, the Irish national broadcaster.
The Irish Independent is already involved with a consortium, Princes
Holdings, which operates cable networks in Cork and Limerick and a microwave
broadcast service in the west of Ireland. The other shareholders are TCI and
United International Holdings, a US cable operator. UIH is also likely to be
involved in the Northern Ireland bid.
The TeleWest consortium will be challenged by a consortium that includes
Ulster Television, which is determined to be part of a bid although under
broadcasting legislation it can have no more than 20 per cent.
Ulster TV is believed to be talking to Comcast, the quoted US cable operator
which is the eighth-largest cable group in the UK with wholly owned
franchises in Teesside and Darlington and large stakes in franchises in
London, Birmingham and East Anglia. Comcast and Ulster hope to bring in
another local Northern Ireland investor before bids have to be in on January
23 next year.
Applicants for the licence have to specify which parts of Northern Ireland
they plan to cable and on what timetable.
At least one of the other large cable operators in Britain is understood to
be looking at the Northern Ireland licence.
Normally the licence will go to the the highest bidder.
Although the licence is for the whole of Ulster only cities and larger towns
are likely to be cabled. Rural areas could be serviced by microwave
broadcasting, but little equipment is yet available for the frequencies
specified.

Coal traders are to complain to the European Commission that British Gas is
receiving about Pounds 65m of 'support' from the Department of Social
Security arising from the DSS's practice of paying gas bills directly for
claimants who are in arrears.
It is not possible for claimants who use solid fuel to get the same help,
the traders say, and the market is distorted as a result.
They will also complain that the system of pricing under which householders
pay the same for gas throughout Britain distorts the market. The traders
says this is possible because of British Gas's near monopoly.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Call to liberalise media rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Frank Rogers, chairman of the European Publishers' Council, yesterday
called for radical liberalisation of media rules in the UK, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
He warned that outdated rules were putting publishers at a disadvantage in
investing in the multimedia revolution.
He was speaking at the launch of a study which found that while newspaper
publishers in the UK were prevented from owning more than 20 per cent of a
television company there were no special restrictions on computer companies.
The report on media regulation in the UK argues that rapid changes in
technology have created anomalies. For example, the owner of a foreign
newspaper controlled within the European Union can buy an ITV company but a
UK newspaper publisher cannot.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Medical insurance tax relief costs soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost to the government of giving tax relief on private medical insurance
for the over-60s is still rising rapidly in spite of moves in last year's
Budget to limit the rate of the relief to 25 per cent.
A written answer last week by Sir George Young, financial secretary to the
Treasury, put the cost of the relief in 1994-95 at Pounds 95m - up from
Pounds 80m in 1993-94. Last November, the Inland Revenue said the cost in
1994-95 was expected to be 'around Pounds 85m'. The Revenue yesterday said
that the premiums charged by private-sector insurers had gone up much more
than expected.
Sir George's answer - in response to a written question by Mr Hugh Bayley,
Labour MP for York - also revealed that the annual cost of providing the
relief has more than doubled since its introduction in April 1990.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Portillo predicts high-wage future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's policy is to turn Britain into a 'high-wage, not a low-wage
economy', Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, said yesterday.
Britain cannot hope to compete in the global economy 'by driving down its
wage levels', he told the Institute of Personnel and Development's
conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. He said: 'We have to increase the
value that people add to their business through education and training. The
aim must be a highly motivated workforce where the individual is rewarded
for skill and productivity.'
In his first big speech outlining his employment policy, Mr Portillo was
keen to dispel any suggestion that he wanted to turn Britain into a sweat
shop in order to compete with the emerging economies of Asia and South
America.
He said: 'For the moment, those emerging economies have the competitive
advantages of low wages and even lower non-wage costs. But for the moment,
the developed world, including Britain, retains an advantage in terms of the
skills and knowledge of its workforce.'
But he warned that the competition was not standing still and that the Asian
competitors, in particular, were laying 'heavy emphasis on the education of
their people'.
Mr Portillo said Britain and the rest of Europe had to 'keep costs firmly
under control' and 'raise the knowledge and skill-base of its workforce'.
While dismissing the idea of a statutory minimum wage and more social
regulation from the European Union, Mr Portillo said Britain should increase
its competitive edge by creating products which owed 'more to human
knowledge than to human muscle'.
He added: 'Our future lies in providing goods and services which have high
added-value because of their technology, design or innovation. They are
likely to be the basis of our prosperity in an increasingly competitive
world.'

FT  27 OCT 94 / 40% error rate in CSA awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A report into the operations of the Child Support Agency has revealed
considerable errors in the calculation and allocation of maintenance
assessments, in spite of attempts to improve the organisation's operations
over the past year.
As ministers consider whether to introduce fresh reforms of the CSA, Mr
Ernie Hazlewood, the chief child support officer, issued a report yesterday
showing that nearly 40 per cent of the maintenance assessments made over the
past year had been incorrect.
Mr Hazlewood, whose department is part of the government's Central
Adjudication Service, also found that proper procedures for calculating
maintenance had been followed in only one in seven cases. In his report, he
acknowledged that the CSA's managers had recognised the need for action to
improve standards and had undertaken a wide-ranging study to improve
services.
Mr Alistair Burt, the minister responsible for the CSA's operations,
admitted that the findings were 'disappointing'.
The report was based on a random investigation of 1,380 cases in which child
maintenance had been made. Mr Hazlewood reported that, in this sample, the
maintenance assessment was incorrect in 545 cases (39.5 per cent) and that
adjudication comments were raised by recipients on another 486 occasions.
There was also concern about the way earnings were calculated. Assessments
did not follow legislative requirements in 25 per cent of cases and were
'doubtful' in a further 13 per cent.
The Commons social security committee is looking at how the CSA can be
reformed. The committee will consider whether clean-break settlements
between couples should be taken into account in the assessment of
maintenance.
Social security department officials have said they will wait for the
publication of the report before deciding whether to introduce legislation
to change the CSA next year.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Allies of Blair win jobs in reshuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday tightened his grip on Labour's economic strategy
with an extensive shake-up of the party's frontbench team. The move puts
several younger allies who last week failed to be elected to the shadow
cabinet in key positions.
The Labour leader underlined his determination to put the main economic
departments firmly in the hands of the party's modernising wing by
appointing Mr Brian Wilson and Ms Hilary Armstrong to prominent posts in the
trade and industry and Treasury teams respectively.
Mr Wilson augmented his reputation with his skilful harrying of the
government as shadow transport spokesman during the railway privatisation
bill. Ms Armstrong was a loyal aide to John Smith, the former Labour leader.
Mr Alistair Darling, another close ally of Mr Blair, will continue in his
role as the party's City spokesman, with Mr Alun Michael continuing to
support Mr Jack Straw in home affairs.
This leaves Ms Dawn Primarolo as the only 'traditionalist' member of Mr
Gordon Brown's shadow Treasury team. Mr Andrew Smith, another moderniser,
was confirmed as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury some days ago.
Mr Derek Fatchett, a leading traditionalist, was moved from trade and
industry to defence.
Mr Blair was expected today to signal his intention of reshaping the Labour
whip's office as the principal training ground for the party's stars of the
future. Mr Peter Mandelson, the party's former communications director, was
among a number of members of Labour's 1992 Commons intake being tipped for a
job there as part of the new strategy.
There were several prominent jobs for women in the new line-up. Ms Ann Clwyd
was appointed to back up Mr John Prescott, deputy leader, as well as moving
to Mr Robin Cook's frontbench foreign affairs team where she joins Ms Joyce
Quin. Ms Joan Ruddock will be the party's spokeswoman on environmental
protection. Ms Llin Golding will speak on children and families.
In employment, Mr Kevin Barron, an ex-aide to Mr Neil Kinnock, the former
Labour leader, will support Ms Harriet Harman along with Mr Ian McCartney, a
traditionalist.
Mr Kevin McNamara, previously Northern Ireland spokesman, moves to the civil
service portfolio. Mr George Foulkes, who resigned as defence spokesman a
year ago before he was fined for assaulting a police constable, returns as
overseas development spokesman. The home affairs team is completed by Mr
George Howarth, noted for his research into quangos, and Mr Kim Howells. Mr
David Blunkett will be supported in education by Mr Bryan Davies and Mr
Peter Kilfoyle, an unsuccessful challenger as chief whip. Mr Nick Brown
joins Mrs Margaret Beckett at health.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Quality standard rigidity rapped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The BS5750 quality assurance standard is unsuitable for the smallest
companies, the Small Business Research Trust warned yesterday.
In a report the group says the standard is too costly, rigid and formal for
smaller companies which often rely on the 'hands-on approach' of
owner-managers.
There was no evidence that informal quality systems, based on the personal
involvement of business owners and employees with detailed knowledge of
customer requirements, were inferior to more formal systems such as BS5750
accreditation, the report says.
The report is based on responses from more than 4,000 smaller companies and
was sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry, the British Standards
Institution and National Westminster Bank.
It is one of the most comprehensive inquiries into the relevence to small
businesses of a standard that the institution says was 'written by big
business for big business'.
The survey found that BS5750 - or BS EN ISO 9000, as it is now called after
its European Union counterpart - was widely seen as a useful marketing tool.
'Users derived significant benefits, notably relating to marketing and
competitive issues rather than internal operational efficiency', the report
says.
Mr Francis Chittenden of Manchester Business School's business development
unit, co-author of the report, said it showed that BS5750 would be relevant
to some small companies and not others.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Personnel directors lose on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Personnel directors are paid an average of almost 10 per cent less than
other types of director, a report published today has found.
The report on personnel management pay, published by the Reward Group in
association with the Institute of Personnel and Development, says that,
overall, personnel staff received a median across-the-board pay rise of 3
per cent in the past 12 months.
Personnel directors earn Pounds 45,000 a year on average, says Reward,
compared with Pounds 49,920 for all other types of director. Most middle and
senior ranking personnel managers below the level of director, however, are
ahead of their management colleagues. A senior personnel manager could
expect to earn Pounds 36,500 a year on average against Pounds 34,736 for
other managers at an equivalent level.
The pay of women personnel officers trails that of men. The proportion of
women in top personnel jobs, however, is growing. Just over a quarter of
personnel directors in the survey were women, compared with just over a
fifth in the previous two years.
The report found a high level of job satisfaction in personnel departments
although overall, compared with last year, respondents consider they have
fewer job prospects.
The Institute of Personnel and Development is preparing a bid for royal
charter status, Mr Geoff Armstrong, its director general, said yesterday.
The 72,000-strong institute was formed this year by a merger between the
Institute of Personnel Management and the Institute of Training and
Development.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Reynolds ready to amend claim to Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Irish government has told its British counterpart privately that it is
willing to amend the most sensitive element of its constitutional claim to
Northern Ireland.
But draft amendments suggested by Dublin to article 2 of the constitution -
which defines Ulster as part of the republic's 'national territory' - do not
go far enough to meet the UK government's demands.
The amendments have been tabled as part of the intense negotiations on a
framework document to provide the basis for a political settlement for the
province.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has signalled that he is ready
to submit to a referendum changes to the less controversial article 3 of the
constitution, which also refers to the jurisdiction claimed by the republic.
But publicly the Dublin government has strongly resisted the suggestion that
it might change article 2 which states simply: 'The national territory
consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas.'
British officials hope Dublin's private acceptance that article 2 is no
longer inviolate will help break the deadlock in the talks on a framework
document. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, told Mr Reynolds earlier
this week that an overall deal acceptable to Ulster's moderate unionists
would be impossible without a radical revision of the constitutional claim.
But it is understood the two possible revisions so far suggested by Dublin
do not meet the central unionist demands that Ulster must be recognised as
outside the 'national territory' and that they no longer be defined as
members of the 'Irish nation'.
These indications of Dublin's position came on the eve of the first Commons
debate on Northern Ireland since the republican and loyalist ceasefires.
During the debate, ministers may be pressed on last week's move by Mr Major
to separate plans for an Ulster assembly from wider talks on the province's
status.
The move appeared to irritate Dublin, although the prime minister said at
Chequers on Monday that it would be a 'misreading' to suggest he was trying
to detach one from the other.
If questioned today on whether the 'nothing is agreed until everything is
agreed' formula governing political talks on the province still applies,
ministers are expected to say that the basis upon which talks began in 1991
will stay in place unless and until the participants decide other-wise.
Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, told party members earlier
this month that the formula, which is strongly supported by nationalists,
was 'now unworkable'.

The government has withdrawn its plans to ask all students aiming for a
three-year science doctorate to take a one-year masters qualification in
research first. The aim was to filter out students who would not pass their

Gateshead Borough Council has won a test case ruling that a unit at the
MetroCentre retail development requires planning permission for a change
from retail to restaurant use.
But in a second decision, also announced yesterday, the Department of the
Environment found in favour of the Church Commissioners, the MetroCentre's
owners, with a ruling that the erection of a sign and glazed shop front at
another MetroCentre unit did not require permission.

department store in Knightsbridge, is an implausible guardian of British
public morals. Yet it cannot be denied that he has shown a remarkable and
consistent knack of exposing double standards in the City, government and
the press.
Before the mid-1980s, when he and his brothers came to public attention
because of their bid for the House of Fraser stores group, Mr Fayed had sat
on the board of Mr Tiny Rowland's controversial international conglomerate,
Lonrho, and acted as a middleman for British contractors in the Gulf. How he
progressed from there to acquiring sufficient funds to launch a cash bid
that valued House of Fraser at Pounds 615m has never been satisfactorily
explained.
Leading merchant bankers in the City were nonetheless prepared to take this
potentially lucrative client at his own valuation. Chief among them were
Kleinwort Benson, one of whose then directors, Mr John MacArthur, declared
on television at the time that he personally knew the net worth of the
Fayeds to be several billion dollars. In the light of subsequent events the
inquiries that supported this assertion appear to have been less than
rigorous.
Nor did the Department of Trade or the Office of Fair Trading look far into
the Fayeds' background. The secretary of state, Mr Norman (now Lord) Tebbit,
waved through the bid within 10 days, relying heavily on the names of the
professional advisers, who included City lawyers Herbert Smith alongside
Kleinworts.
The press was equally uncritical, giving credence to stories circulated by
City public relations man Mr Brian Basham. The Fayeds' fortune, according to
Mr Basham, derived from a cotton empire founded by their great grandfather
in the 19th century, which then expanded into shipping as they exported
their wares to the mills of Lancashire.
The first indication that these stories were questionable emerged when Mr
Rowland, who believed that the Fayeds had deceived him over their intention
to buy Harrods, started a public campaign to discredit the brothers, dubbing
them 'the phoney pharoahs'. Subsequent independent inquiries by the
Financial Times and a Channel Four television documentary did indeed
discover that the Fayed brothers' origins and funds were not what they
claimed.
The findings were later confirmed by a Department of Trade inspectors
report. The inspectors concluded that the Fayeds 'dishonestly misrepresented
their origins, their wealth, their business interests and their resources to
the secretary of state, the Office of Fair Trading, the press, the House of
Fraser board and House of Fraser shareholders, and their own advisers'.
Among other things, it emerged that Mr Mohamed Fayed's colourful past
included an adventure in the 1960s in which he absconded with Dollars
100,000 belonging to the Haitian government of 'Papa Doc' Duvalier. He was
known in this impoverished Caribbean country as a Kuwaiti sheikh.
The Arab equivalent of the particule nobiliaire - Mohamed 'Al' Fayed - was
adopted in the early 1970s. By the 1980s Mr Fayed had become an adviser to
the Sultan of Brunei. Through a power of attorney he also had access to the
Sultan's bank account. While the DTI inspectors were unable to prove that
the Sultan's money paid for the bid, they concluded that this was the most
likely explanation for the Fayed brothers' sudden ability to finance a huge
takeover bid.
The connection with the Sultan also opened important doors, notably that of
No 10 Downing Street before the bid. Mr Fayed has claimed in the press that
he was instrumental in persuading the Sultan not to withdraw Brunei's funds
from sterling. He also claims to have persuaded the Sultan not to take
defence contracts elsewhere.
Despite the fact that the Fayed brothers clearly deceived the government, no
action was taken by ministers to disqualify them as directors of a public
company. This inertia has never been satisfactorily explained, although the
late Nicholas Ridley, when trade and industry secretary, justified the
decision not to pursue the brothers by saying that no shareholder had
suffered and that the matter was trivial.
What was not made public at the time was that Mr Fayed had privately donated
Pounds 250,000 to Tory party funds. Whether the new independent commission
of inquiry under Lord Nolan will take such a relaxed view remains to be
seen. The grant of money to Tory party funds was confirmed to the Financial
Times by a spokesman for Mr Fayed last week. It appears to cast the
government's weak response to the DTI inspectors' findings in a new and
dramatic light.
Nor have the inspectors' findings loosened all ties with the Fayeds'
professional and establishment friends. Herbert Smith continued to act for
Mr Mohamed Fayed's business interests after the publication of the
inspectors' report - this despite the report's revelation that a Herbert
Smith partner had been systematically deceived on a trip to Egypt to inquire
into the Fayeds' origins and wealth.
While Kleinwort Benson parted company with House of Fraser, Mr MacArthur
continued to act as a consultant to the Fayeds. Nor was former minister Mr
Neil Hamilton alone in having enjoyed hospitality at the Fayeds' Paris Ritz.
Several establishment and showbusiness personalities went there when Mr
Fayed completed the restoration of the late Duke of Windsor's Paris home.
So, too, did leading journalists. There is a striking correlation between a
number of the beneficiaries of this largesse and uncritical press comment,
including the designation of Mr Fayed as Mohamed 'Al' Fayed.
The Queen, meanwhile, continues to meet Mr Fayed at the Windsor Horse Show,
which derives support from Harrods.
Although the Fayed brothers have spent large sums in an attempt to
rehabilitate their reputation, they have never sued those in the media who
revealed their deceptions before publication of the DTI inspectors' report,
which enjoys qualified privilege in terms of libel.
Nor did their case against the DTI inspectors in the European Court of Human
Rights meet with success - in spite of the court's known reservations about
the department's investigation process.
Mr Fayed has frequently claimed that he wants British justice. Given that he
has never refuted the claims produced by his critics, the question Lord
Nolan might be tempted to ask is why British justice has not been visited
upon him.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Tighter checks on spending by quangos
urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, last
night called for more effective checks on the spending of taxpayers' money
by quangos.
He urged the government to expand the powers of the committee and the
National Audit Office - the government spending watchdog - to enable them to
inspect the books of all quangos primarily financed from public funds.
Mr Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyme and a former Treasury minister,
said he and Sir Peter Hordern, Conservative MP for Horsham and chairman of
the Public Accounts Commission, had already discussed the issue with Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
While hoping for a favourable response from the government, Mr Sheldon
admitted that the public accounts committee was unlikely to be given the
power to 'pursue public money wherever it goes'.
Pressing for wider powers for the National Audit Office, he said it should
be able to audit the accounts of all quangos.
Quangos should also be required to change their auditors frequently so that
they did not develop 'too close a relationship' with a particular group of
accountants.
More stringent checks on the activities of quangos were also demanded by Mr
Robert Maclennan, president of the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Maclennan said the government should recognise that there was something
wrong going far beyond a few local difficulties.
He insisted that the National Audit Office should have the power to decide
which quangos it wished to investigate, and go where the government would
prefer it not to go.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Nolan known as tough liberal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Nolan, the law lord appointed by the prime minister to head the review
of standards in public life, is a former leading tax lawyer who has quickly
built a reputation as an independent and liberal-minded judge.
In a series of high-profile cases since his appointment to the High Court
bench in 1982 he has shown he is not scared to stand up to the executive and
to break new ground.
In 1991, sitting with the former Master of the Rolls, Lord Donaldson, he
ruled that ministers and civil servants were 'accountable to the law and the
courts for their personal actions', in finding Mr Kenneth Baker, then home
secretary, guilty of contempt of court.
Mr Baker was the first minister of the Crown to be found in contempt while
carrying out official duties. The home secretary had failed to comply with a
court order requiring the return to Britain of a Zairean asylum-seeker who
had been unlawfully deported while legal proceedings were pending.
A month later Lord Nolan again publicly criticised Mr Baker for refusing to
set out parole terms for a convicted IRA terrorist.
His credentials as part of a liberal majority in the country's highest court
were underlined when he sat as part of the appeal courts which overturned
the convictions of the Birmingham Six and Ms Judith Ward.
Lord Nolan has also shown, however, that he is not afraid of public
criticism for judgments which he believes to be right, even if unpopular.
In 1992 he ruled that an anorexic girl could be forcibly treated against her
will. In 1991 he was part of an appeal court which rejected compensation
claims for nervous shock by relatives and friends of those who died in the
the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster.
In 1989 he gave Moslem leaders the right to challenge a magistrate's refusal
to issue blasphemy summonses against Mr Salman Rushdie, author of the
Satanic Verses.
Lord Nolan, 66, is a Roman Catholic of Irish descent, educated at Ampleforth
and Wadham College, Oxford. He was called to the Bar in 1953, where he
quickly built a reputation as a specialist tax lawyer.
During the long-running Rossminster affair, which led to a crackdown by the
Inland Revenue on tax avoidance schemes, he was asked to give his opinion on
an advance interest scheme devised by Mr Roy Tucker, one of Rossminster's
founders.
Lawyers said yesterday that his experience in dealing with highly complex
tax issues made him an ideal choice to head the review of standards in
public office.
Lord Nolan was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1991 and became a law lord
in January.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Pensions switch tax blow forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thousands of workers moving into pension schemes for the first time may face
extra income tax demands, the President of the Institute of Taxation said
yesterday.
Mr Ian Luder urged the government to take statutory action to help those
affected. Two recent developments in the pensions industry will result in
large movements into schemes.
In September the European Court of Justice ruled that barring part-time
workers from pension schemes amounted to indirect discrimination against
women and must stop.
Earlier this week the Securities and Investments Board said hundreds of
thousands of personal pensions sold since 1988 had to be reviewed.
Large numbers of workers will be seeking entry to pension schemes and the
backdating of payments and benefits.
Although contributions to pension schemes of less than 15 per cent receive
tax relief, Mr Luder is worried that the most vulnerable workers entering
pension schemes may have to make a first-time contribution over the 15 per
cent tax threshold.
The Inland Revenue said those involved could avoid the 'rolling-up' of
contributions by asking pension companies for an instalment plan.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Docklands line to be sold: Loss-making railway to be
franchised for seven years before privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Docklands Light Railway, which links the City with east London,
is to be franchised to a private-sector operator in 1996 before being sold
off completely seven years later.
Announcing plans for the privatisation of the 15-mile railway, Mr John
Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday said the government would also
seek bids from private consortia to build an extension costing between
Pounds 110m and Pounds 130m under the Thames to Greenwich and Lewisham.
The decision to franchise the DLR before selling it completely reflects in
part the railway's large losses. The DLR expects to earn revenues of only
Pounds 7m this year against operating costs of Pounds 18m - but is expected
to move into profit during the period of the franchise. A declining level of
subsidy is likely to be provided until then.
The DLR, which uses driverless trains, carried its first passengers in 1987
but its early years were dogged by technical problems and the need for an
upgrade to cater for passenger numbers, which were larger than planned for.
A new management team which joined in December 1991 has modernised the
railway's signalling, improved reliability and built a new extension to the
east. In the past 12 months the number of passengers has risen by 40 per
cent to 45,000 a day.
The DLR is expected to prove attractive to franchise bidders, including
possibly its own management, because, unlike British Rail routes, it will be
offered as a fully integrated railway, owning its own track and operating
its trains. It is owned by the London Docklands Development Corporation.
Bidders for the 2 1/2 -mile Lewisham extension will be invited to
pre-qualify through the official journal of the European Union early next
month and a shortlist will be announced in January. The winner, which will
design and maintain the line but not operate train services, will be
announced in about 12 months.
The winner would be awarded a fixed-term concession for a period of up to 25
years and be paid on the basis of the availability and performance of the
track as well as passenger numbers.
This arrangement would allow the franchise operator and eventual buyer of
the DLR to have full control of all DLR services while paying the
construction consortium for the use of the Lewisham link.
A decision on whether to build an underground station at the Cutty Sark in
Greenwich, a popular tourist destination, will depend on the private sector
agreeing by January 1995 to put up Pounds 14m to meet its costs. Otherwise
the Lewisham line will go ahead with only four new stations.
Expressions of interest have come from Italy, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong
as well as the UK. Work is expected to take as long as 3 1/2 years.

FT  27 OCT 94 / RAF threatens snub for Westland in Pounds 1bn helicopter
order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Air Force is pressing for its fleet of transport helicopters to be
updated using only the latest version of the US-made Boeing Chinook, rather
than the mixed fleet of Chinooks and Westland EH101 helicopters originally
proposed.
This is the latest of a series of military procurement decisions that pit
off-the-shelf US products against European-developed alternatives. The
European Future Large Aircraft is fighting the Lockheed C-130J Hercules for
a Pounds 900m RAF order, and the US Apache helicopter is vying with the
European Tiger in the Pounds 2bn competition for the British Army's attack
helicopter.
The RAF will argue for the Chinook when the Pounds 1bn order for up to 40
support helicopters goes to the Ministry of Defence equipment committee next
week. However, the army, also represented on the committee, is thought to
favour a mixed fleet of helicopters to give versatility.
The Chinook can lift 10 tonnes against the EH101's 4.5 tonnes, but the EH101
is smaller and more agile with better night-operating capacity, making it
more suitable for some military missions.
Westland, the helicopter maker owned by GKN, has been hoping for an order
for about 25 EH101s from the RAF. As well as helping to secure thousands of
jobs in Yeovil, Somerset, the order would be an important endorsement from
the MoD which would help the helicopter's export prospects.
At present, Westland is negotiating to sell the anti-submarine version of
the EH101 to several Gulf states.
The equipment committee will consider the industrial and military issues
before making recommendations to the Treasury and MoD ministers. A final
decision is expected from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, within
three months.
The MoD is thought to be concerned about the cost of the EH101 relative to
its carrying capacity. It is also worried that several hundred million
pounds may have to be spent on development to bring the EH101 up to the
required specification. The Chinook, by contrast, would not need any extra
development spending.
Set against that, the industrial arguments for supporting Westland's bid are
strong, and the MoD is thought to be pressing Westland to cut its bid price.
If Mr Rifkind opts for a purely Chinook fleet, it will be an indication that
he will be prepared to take the political flak that would follow from a
series of orders for foreign-made equipment.

Nissan Motor, the Japanese car manufacturer, yesterday lost its appeal
against a High Court ruling that it should pay Pounds 6m to Nissan UK, its
former importers and distributors.
The Court of Appeal upheld a ruling of March last year that Nissan Motor had
entered into an agreement with Nissan UK to pay the Pounds 6m as an
incentive for taking 12,700 Bluebird cars shortly before they went out of
production in 1990. Nissan Motor had denied that such an agreement had been
negotiated with Mr Octav Botnar, Nissan UK chairman.

Production from Britain's North Sea oil wells reached its highest level for
six years, Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday.
The bank's monthly oil index report shows production in September at its
highest level since April 1988 - an average 2.57m barrels a day.
The rise came as several fields re-started after maintenance shutdowns.
The increase meant that even though oil prices are low, oil and gas output
has increased by Pounds 5m a day on the same period a year ago, Royal Bank
of Scotland said.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Accountants warned on ties to Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY, Accountancy Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The accountancy profession should distance itself from the Conservative
party and the interests of the big firms, one of the six leading trade
bodies has urged.
The deputy chief executive of Cipfa, the public services accountancy
institute, warned in a provocative speech that the profession was seen by
many as 'overly political'.
Mr Richard Morris said: 'The profession has a considerable number of
Conservative MPs, tends to act through Conservative spokesmen, but not
always, and this encourages its perception as being part of the
establishment.'
The speech acknowledges that efforts by the six professional bodies to agree
reforms to the profession through the Bishop committee have 'stalled'.
Coupled with recent moves by other professional bodies, the speech indicates
a widespread belief that the committee is unable to break the deadlock over
institutional reform.
As a result Cipfa has decided to 'give new focus to the debate' by setting
out some controversial issues.
Cipfa, with members in both public and private sectors, has been deeply
affected by government policies on privatisation within local government.
Mr Morris told a conference at the University of Bristol that competition
between the bodies was driving down standards because of the desire to
increase financial resources and student numbers.
He warned against the interests of the profession being aligned too closely
to the big firms' commercial interests. 'The two are not the same and can be
in direct conflict,' he said.
On party political affiliation he said: 'This is not in the long-run
interests of the profession, and it ought to be much more neutral in its
political posture.'
Mr Morris said that rising costs had forced the professional bodies to
compete to generate income, and they had had to take on regulatory roles in
conflict with the interests of their members.
He attacked the 'conservative education and training policies' of the bodies
and their reluctance to embrace change in the form of devolved or continuous
assessment.
'They are reluctant to move down the NVQ route and they are reluctant to
give authority over educational matters to other bodies which are
specialists in education, such as universities.'
With technical knowledge developing fast Mr Morris sees the need for regular
assessment of the membership, say every five years, to ensure standards are
maintained.

FT  27 OCT 94 / US Mid-Term Elections (November 8): Kennedy pulls back from
abyss - Reports of senator's political death could be premature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Suddenly it seems that Mr Edward Kennedy, in his 32nd year as a US senator,
can look forward to another six in Washington representing his native
Massachusetts. He emerged relatively unsca-thed from his first televised
debate with Mr Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, on Tuesday night.
Simultaneously two local polls gave him leads of 12 and 18 points, a vast
improvement on last month when his edge had all but evaporated.
The prospect of liberal Massachusetts voting against one of the great
liberals in the Senate had been unthinkable. The state and the Kennedy name
have been indivisible for generations, with his hold on office not even
seriously threatened by the 1969 tragedy of Chappaquiddick when he drove a
car off a bridge and a young woman companion drowned.
Yet, however improbably, he had appeared to be in trouble as the Republicans
went after the three great liberal scalps they would love to remove from
office - Mr Kennedy, Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, and, in the state of
Washington, Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House.
The senator's particular vulnerability stems partly from his political
longevity in a year when incumbency is a dirty word and, partly, because, at
62 and overweight, his image as a tired and ageing satyr looked as if it
were catching up with him. Mr Romney certainly offered a contrasting
candidacy. He is the wholesome 47-year-old venture capitalist son of Mr
George Romney, former governor of Michigan who was well in the running for
the 1968 Republican presidential nomination before he confessed to having
been 'brainwashed' into supporting the Vietnam war.
Though a political neophyte, Mr Romney's policy prescriptions - more
business and less government - challenged Mr Kennedy's belief in the
efficacy of government. Conservative positions have, after all, taken root
even in Massachusetts, with Governor Bill Weld, the Republican, not only
popular but virtually certain of re-election next month.
Thus, barely two weeks ago, the columnists had begun to foresee Mr Kennedy's
demise. From the right, Mr George Will gleefully proclaimed: 'Massachusetts
may be the Jurassic Park of American politics where the dinosaur of
liberalism lumbers on oblivious to the fact that its era has long since
past. But the Tyrannosaurus Rex is endangered.'
From the left, Ms Ellen Goodman found 'a whiff of defeat in the fall air' in
a race 'that looks more and more like a beauty contest'. She quoted a sad
Kennedy supporter saying 'he looks like a homeless man in a thousand dollar
suit'.
What has happened is that Mr Kennedy has begun to fight - and with plenty of
assistance from outside the state. President Bill Clinton, whose ratings in
Massachusetts are the highest in the nation, has already campaigned with the
senator once and plans to do so again. The Kennedy he knew, Mr Clinton said,
was not some liberal ideologue but more capable than any Democrat in the
Senate of persuading Republicans to come out of the bunker of eternal
resistance.
Mr Kennedy was certainly combative in a sharp and often rancorous debate on
Tuesday night. When his opponent accused him of making profits on a
Washington real estate deal 'at the taxpayers' expense',Mr Kennedy shot
back, invoking the tragedies that have visited his family. 'Mr Romney, the
Kennedys are not in public service to make money. We have paid too high a
price.'
Mr Romney gave as good as he got. When Mr Kennedy charged he had refused
healthcare to part-time employees, the Republican said the Kennedy family
had done the same at one of its businesses.
The post-debate scorecards mostly pointed to a draw, but, as one Boston
political seer put it: 'If Kennedy didn't lose, he won, and if Romney didn't
win, he lost.'

FT  27 OCT 94 / Cuba reforms extend to consumer goods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Cuba's hard-pressed consumers, still digesting the novelty of farm produce
markets opened on October 1, received a further dose of free market economic
reform yesterday when the government authorised a similar system to sell
scarce manufactured and consumer goods.
Individuals and local state industries will now be able to sell goods
directly to the public with traders, not the state, setting prices. A
government decree said the goods would be offered through a network of
shops, street markets and other authorised public vending points.
'People will be able to sell absolutely everything,' a commentator on
state-run Radio Rebelde said. He gave as examples furniture, mattresses,
household articles such as brooms and window blinds, spare plumbing parts
and clothes.
As with the farm markets, vendors will have to pay a tax on sales.
The markets selling manufactured and consumer goods - which, like the farm
markets, will operate in Cuban pesos - indicate a further easing of the
state's grip on economic production. They will also create more
opportunities for self-employed private manufacturers and crafts people.
These were authorised to operate on a limited scale late last year and had
started selling their wares at a small number of street market sites, which
are expected rapidly to increase in number.
Chronic shortages of even the most basic consumer articles have been a
headache for Cubans for years. Problems worsened after 1990 when local
manufacturing was hit by the collapse of Cuba's preferential trade relations
with the former Soviet bloc. The continuing US trade and financial embargo
applied an additional squeeze.
Cubans turned to the black market, where an army of clandestine
seamstresses, tailors, plumbers and mechanics sprung up.
The farm produce markets have been well received by Cubans. Not only have
shoppers been able to stock up with food staples, but prices are well below
those in the black market.
Authorities say the farm markets are easing food shortages and have dealt a
blow to the black market. But they add it will be six months or more before
they will be able to assess whether the markets have stimulated food
production, particularly by small farmers.

FT  27 OCT 94 / US orders show modest increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US durable goods orders rose by a modest 0.1 per cent in September compared
with August, mostly because of big new contracts in the defence sector. The
month saw a 21.7 per cent increase in orders for military ships and tanks,
more than twice the 10.8 per cent advance of the previous month.
Last month's increase in the overall index, according to the Commerce
Department, is the second in a row, the seventh this year and the 12th in
the last 14 months. New factory orders are 14 per cent above the level of
the corresponding month last year, while the third quarter result produced a
1.5 per cent increase on the April-June period.
The volatility in defence orders has produced large swings in durable goods
orders in recent months. The August performance was yesterday revised
upwards to a 6.4 per cent gain from 6.1 per cent, while in July orders
dropped by 3.9 per cent.
Defence buying meant that the transportation component rose 2.1 per cent in
September. Excluding this sector, the index dropped 0.6 per cent, after a
2.5 per cent rise in the previous month, with orders for industrial
machinery and equipment falling by 2.5 per cent.
New orders for non-defence capital goods, a more reliable indication of the
state of manufacturing, rose 0.5 per cent in the month, following a 3.4 per
cent increase in August.
The modest rise in durable goods orders was in keeping with the picture of
continued robust economic growth, US analysts said yesterday, agencies add
from New York and Washington.
'There is still a lot of momentum in the economy,' said economist Ms Cynthia
Latta of DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting company in Lexington,
Massachusetts.

<TEXT>
Canada's economic growth appears to be continuing at a vigorous pace, but
the underlying rate of inflation is expected to remain low, the Bank of
Canada said in its autumn review.
'Economic activity expanded at more than 5 per cent in the first half of the
year, and the economy appears to be continuing to grow at a vigorous pace,'
the bank said. 'It is estimated that, in spite of the rise in capacity
utilisation, the economy has room to expand at a growth rate above potential
for some time.'
The underlying rate of inflation had remained in the lower part of the
'inflation-control target band' and was expected to remain there, the bank
added. Excluding indirect taxes and movements in the food and energy
components, the 12-month inflation rate had remained at about 1.7 per cent,
the bank said, using data to September 23. Economic activity expanded at an
annualised rate of 6.4 per cent in the second quarter. 'Over the balance of
the year, output should grow at a solid, although somewhat slower, pace.'

<TEXT>
Some US hospitals are still refusing to treat emergency patients unable to
pay for medical care, despite a federal law forbidding the practice of
'patient dumping'. A consumer group, Public Citizen's Health Research Group,
reported yesterday that 86 hospitals in 22 states were cited by the federal
government for refusing to treat emergency patients for non-medical reasons
during 1993 and the first quarter of 1994.
Ms Joan Stieber, co-author of the report and a lawyer with the health
research group, said the organisation believed many incidents of patient
dumping went unreported and that no state or region was exempt. Under a law
passed in 1986, hospitals are forbidden to deny for non-medical reasons
treatment to any emergency patient or woman in labour. 'Enforcement is only
touching the tiniest tip of the iceberg,' said Ms Stieber. 'On the whole, we
think this is a pretty consistent problem across the country.'

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All Californians would have to carry identification cards to prove their
citizenship if voters pass a proposition to cut services to illegal
immigrants, Governor Pete Wilson says. In an interview with the San
Francisco Chronicle yesterday, Mr Wilson rejected the idea that people born
in the US might resent having to carry an ID card. 'If you are a legal
resident you have absolutely nothing to fear,' Mr Wilson told the newspaper.
'It has nothing whatsoever to do with eye or skin colour. You are reasonably
suspect if you cannot provide documentation that you are in the country
legally.'
The card is not part of Proposition 187, a measure on the November 8 ballot
that would deny illegal immigrants in the state public schooling and most
health and welfare benefits. However, Mr Wilson said he believed it would be
needed to enforce Proposition 187 if the measure were approved by voters.
Mr Wilson, who has emphasised Proposition 187 would not affect emergency
healthcare, has made support for the proposition a plank in his re-election
platform. His Democratic opponent, Ms Kathleen Brown, opposes it.
Mexico has protested over the proposition, saying its implementation would
damage US-Mexican relations.

FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Italian leads the field for WTO job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Renato Ruggiero, the European Union candidate to head the future World
Trade Organisation, is leading the three-man field 'by a length', according
to diplomats.
Of the 90-odd countries so far consulted, about a third back him. A quarter
favour Mr Carlos Salinas de Gortari, outgoing Mexican president, with Mr Kim
Chul-su of South Korea not far behind.
Support follows broadly regional lines. Mr Salinas has central and south
America solidly behind him, with Washington giving support behind the
scenes. Mr Kim, South Korea's trade minister, has most of Asia, including
Japan and Australia. Mr Ruggiero, a former Italian trade minister, has
western and eastern Europe, with a sprinkling of Mediterranean, African and
Asian nations.
The decision has to be made by consensus of the 123 members of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. If the three regional blocs hold firm to
their candidates, therefore, a decision could be delayed beyond early
December when Gatt members are due to meet formally to endorse the final
choice.
The WTO is due to come into effect on January 1.
Following last week's consultations, conducted by Mr Andras Szepesi,
Hungary's Gatt ambassador, the political battle has shifted away from
Geneva.
The diplomatic artillery is being trained, first, on the remaining 30 or so
Gatt members, mostly small developing nations with no diplomatic
representation in Geneva. Many have strong trade and aid ties with Brussels
through the European Union's Lome Convention and are likely to back Mr
Ruggiero.
Another line of attack involves securing the second preference votes of
trailing candidates. Both the EU and the Salinas camp have hopes of picking
up Asian backing, on the assumption that Mr Kim will drop out of the race
first.
EU officials believe the Asians would rather support Mr Ruggiero than Mr
Salinas, who is vulnerable to criticism that he is too close to the US and
too 'presidential' to run a technical organisation.
However, trade officials expect Mexico and the US to launch a big diplomatic
offensive at the November 14 summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum to win Apec endorsement for Mr Salinas.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: Washington welcomed the candidacy of Mr
Salinas but realised early that too much enthusiasm could hurt him if he was
seen as 'the US candidate'. Mr Salinas has gone out of his way to
demonstrate his independence from the US, visiting Cuba and promoting trade
ties there and recently warning of trouble if California's anti-immigration
initiative becomes law.
US trade officials are preoccupied by the battle to get approval of the Gatt
implementing legislation. Suspicion of the proposed WTO is intense and Mr
Mickey Kantor the US trade representative, has had to defend it from charges
that the US will be giving up its sovereignty to a foreign body.

FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Japan gets taste for food from abroad -
Imports have reached record levels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan said yesterday it would set up a network of information centres to
deal with an expected surge in consumer inquiries, and even complaints,
about the safety of foreign foodstuffs as food imports reach record levels.
Even before Japan finalises international trade agreements like the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord, food imports are surging thanks to a
strong yen, poor grain harvests in 1993 and a drought this summer.
Three years after Japanese farmers finally lost a fiercely fought campaign
to keep the country's markets closed to foreign beef and oranges, a vast
range of agricultural products from Kansas steak to Australian carrots and
Chinese garlic are entering the country in unprecedented quantities.
This year, Japanese consumers' taste for imported meat, fruit and vegetables
has been particularly noteworthy. In the first six months, imports of beef
rose 23 per cent, that of citrus fruit 25 per cent, and of vegetables 71 per
cent from the previous year, according to Japan's external trade
organisation (ETO).
The trend is such that Japan has now become the world's largest net importer
of farm products, the agriculture ministry proudly proclaims. In the first
half of this year, food imports rose by 18 per cent in dollar terms to
Dollars 22.4bn, says the ETO. Grain imports rose by 62 per cent and
vegetables by 29 per cent.
Last year, agricultural imports totalled Y32.1bn (Dollars 331m) and fishery
imports Dollars 14.7bn, according to finance ministry statistics. The US is
by far the single largest supplier, with nearly a 30 per cent share of
agricultural sales.
Consumer attitudes have changed considerably even since 1991 when the
opening of Japan's market to foreign oranges prompted scare stories about
excessive spraying, and foreign beef was labelled cheap but of poor quality.
The strong growth in imports has come despite veiled but persistent
resistance among the Japanese authorities, whether prompted by vested
interests or genuine concerns about retaining self-sufficiency in food.
Japanese regulations demand that cherries, for example, have to be kept
under 10 degrees centigrade for 12 days before they can be imported into the
country.
Officials sometimes find more vicious ways to obstruct increases in
agricultural imports. Daiei, a big supermarket chain, has had whole
shipments ruined by customs officials spraying insecticide on the grounds
that an insect was seen wriggling under a lettuce leaf. Such sightings did
not happen when the retailer imported in much smaller quantities than it
does today.
'We are importing foreign produce increasingly as regular supplies and not
just to supplement what is available domestically,' says Mr Minoru Tamura,
divisional merchandise manager at Daiei.
The growing difficulty of relying on domestic suppliers alone has recently
encouraged Japanese retailers to look abroad increasingly for even basic
vegetables.
Climate changes, for example, are having a big impact on domestic supplies.
This year, in particular, the unusually hot summer took its toll of domestic
vegetable supplies, leading to shortages and a surge in some prices.
But one-off natural aberrations aside, the structural changes facing
Japanese agriculture are making it imperative that retailers look outside
the country for supplies.
The number of farming households in Japan has dwindled from 6.1m in 1960 to
3.8m in 1990, according to the agriculture ministry. Domestic production, it
says, has shown no growth in recent years.
What is more, half of those engaged in farming are already more than 60
years old and many of them will not find successors to take over what is
more often than not the family business. Last year, only 3,420 out of more
than 665,000 new school-leavers took up farming.
An agreement at the weekend to allocate Y6,010bn to compensate for the
effects of the Uruguay Round global trade accord will help the farming
community but is unlikely to reverse the trend.
The greying of Japan's farming community and the fewer number of hands
available has also meant that, in the words of Daiei's Mr Tamura: 'Japanese
farmers don't like to grow vegetables that are heavy, like cabbage, and
those that require intensive labour, such as tomatoes and cucumbers.'
The benefits of increased agricultural imports to Japanese consumers have
been tremendous. The shortage of certain vegetables as a result of this
year's unusual heat would have led to a surge in prices but 'imported fresh
vegetables helped stabilise the market,' says the ETO. More long-term,
opening the doors to imports is helping to bring Japanese food prices closer
to international market levels.
Mr Tamura expects more agricultural produce to be imported into Japan as
markets are liberated and sees China as a particularly promising source.
Self-sufficiency in basic foods is important, he says. 'But that doesn't
change our policy of buying the best produce from the best source.'

France said yesterday it had toughened terms for providing export credit
guarantees to companies dealing with Saudi Arabia, following a reassessment
of the kingdom's ability to pay promptly. The government said that Coface,
the French export credit agency, was approving short-term credit assurance
(for less than three years) on a case-by-case basis but with increased
'vigilance'. NCM Credit Insurance, which handles 80 per cent of Britain's
short-term export credit guarantees, has already announced it is reducing
the availability of facilities for UK companies exporting to Saudi Arabia.
It said payments delays to exporters were continuing to worsen and expressed
concern at the 'very grave' financial situation. Last month Coface stopped
providing medium-term support for companies trading with the kingdom on the
basis of standard credit terms. It continues to provide medium-term support
to businesses for transactions payable in cash, provided the Saudis also
underwrite the contracts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Skoda, Czech subsidiary of Volkswagen, yesterday launched its first new car
range since its takeover by the German carmaker in 1991. The Felicia small
family car will replace the Favorit range, and comes as the Prague
government appears close to allowing VW to take a majority 50.5 per cent
stake in Skoda. The German company, which bought 31 per cent in 1991 for
DM620m (Dollars 413m), is set to take 70 per cent by the end of 1995 with
the investment of a further DM780m. VW's abrupt move last year to more than
halve its overall investment plan for Skoda by the end of the decade to only
DM3.7bn has soured relations with Prague. However, Czech fears about VW's
commitment appear to have been calmed by pledges to continue developing a
second car range for Skoda, to be launched in late 1996.
Mr Detlev Schmidt, Skoda sales director, outlined ambitious plans yesterday
for expanding the company's worldwide sales and distribution network.
Dealerships were raised from 1,522 at the end of 1991 to 2,100 two years
later and are due to reach 2,500 this year and 4,000 by the end of the
decade. The number of markets in which Skoda cars are sold will rise from 20
in 1991 to 57 by the end of this year, and around 36 new ones are under
study. It has opened up markets above all in Asia, the Middle East and South
America.
The Felicia, developed over the past three years as a far-reaching
modernisation of the Favorit incorporating 1,600 new parts, will be the
first to be offered with VW engines in some versions.

<TEXT>
The European Commission is poised to drop its inhibitions about using
countervailing duties as part of a tougher approach to tackle illicit trade
practices by third countries.
The new policy stems from small but significant changes in European Union
trade regulations which have been tacked on to rules to be adopted as part
of the Uruguay Round, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade global
trade accord.
It also fits into a wider pattern of Europe slowly but steadily
strengthening its trade weaponry, a process accelerated by the need to
harmonise trade rules within the EU as a result of the single market and the
Gatt agreement itself.
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, outlined the changes last week
in a speech to the toy manufacturers of Europe in which he claimed that
Europe had been 'too shy' in using countervailing duties to combat unfair
traders.
'This is no longer the case and the Commission will react quickly to
complaints lodged under the new countervailing regulation,' he promised.
In future, the Commission intends to adopt a US-style definition of
subsidies which will focus on the 'benefit' to the company concerned.
Present European rules mean that the Commission assesses the 'cost to the
government' of providing subsidies. Officials says this last definition is
harder to calculate and usually leads to a lower valuation of damages.
'We (the Europeans) were always hampered because the Americans had a tougher
definition of subsidies,' a trade official said.
However, other Brussels officials acknowledged that the EU had rarely used
countervailing duties for fear of provoking retaliation against Europe's
heavily subsidised farm exports. The Uruguay Round agreement to cut export
subsidies in agriculture meant Brussels would be less inhibited about using
this line of attack.
In similar vein, the Commission intends to make it easier for individual
companies to seek redress against unfair trade in goods, services, and
intellectual property in markets other than the EU. In the past, companies
were asked to raise complaints through their umbrella industries.
The Commission said the new measures were 'absolutely categorically
different' from the controversial Section 301 trade weapon which the US has
used to prise open markets.
It emphasised that the EU would resort to retaliation, only after exhausting
the disputes procedures set out in the new World Trade Organisation. The WTO
is due to come into force after the Gatt agreement is ratified, with the
target date falling in December.
As part of the Gatt deal reached last December, the EU agreed to strengthen
trade weapons, allowing the Commission's preliminary decisions to use
anti-dumping or anti-subsidies to become definitive by a simple majority
vote in the Council of Ministers. Previously, Commission action could be
blocked by a minority of free-trade leaning countries, led by the UK and
Germany.
Also, ministers made it harder for free-traders to block Commission use of
safeguard measures against imports with which the EU has preferential trade
arrangements.
Blocking minorities are still required to invoke safeguard measures against
countries with non-preferential arrangements and in the area of textiles.

partner in China

Microsoft has begun courting local partners to help design and launch the
Chinese version of its next-generation Windows 95 software, Reuter reports
from Beijing.
The effort to cultivate ties with software developers, industry regulators
and the trade press also aims to smooth feathers ruffled during the US
software giant's blunt-edged entry to China last year.
While Windows has emerged as the de facto standard for four out of every
five desktop machines worldwide, Beijing regulators have refused - often
indignantly - to accept the Chinese version of Windows as a standard for
China.
Microsoft executives admit having alienated key electronics ministry
officials by relying heavily on managers from arch-rival Taiwan who looked
down on China's less-developed market and by developing the mainland
version, nicknamed P-Win, not in China but in Taiwan, which uses a different
form of Chinese characters and highly dissimilar methods of keyboard entry.
The company said a Chinese partner would be selected by the end of the year
to assure that Windows 95 was available in China within six months of the US
version.
It also said that Chinese regulators appeared to have dropped their
insistence on protecting the mainland market long enough to allow a
home-grown platform to emerge, a tacit acceptance of Microsoft Windows as a
de facto standard.

FT  27 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Asia-Pacific zone confidence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Senator Bob McMullan, Australia's trade minister, yesterday brushed aside
reports that China had rejected the idea of setting a binding timetable
under which the Asia-Pacific region would move towards 'free trade', saying
he was 'moderately optimistic' a deal could still be achieved. The proposal
will be discussed at next month's summit of Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum leaders in Jakarta. Mr McMullan believed there was a
'reasonable prospect' China would back the proposal, after discussions
between the leaders themselves in Indonesia. The proposal, as currently
mooted would require developed Apec countries, such as the US or Australia,
to remove trade barriers more quickly than less developed ones, but would
see all barriers across the 18-nation grouping eliminated by the year 2020.

A row has broken out between Canberra and Wellington over liberalising the
countries' aviation markets. The Australian authorities are refusing to let
Air New Zealand start a domestic service within Australia next month.
Under a memorandum of understanding signed by the two in 1992, Air New
Zealand was to have gained access to Australia's internal market from
November 1. It would have become the third national carrier, competing with
Qantas, the government-owned airline in which British Airways holds a
minority stake, and Ansett, owned jointly by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News
Corporation and TNT.
However, Canberra is claiming that all the memorandum's conditions have not
been met. It cites the lack of agreement on 'passenger facilitation'
arrangements - the idea was that New Zealand and Australia would become
borderless and visa and customs checks would be redundant - and on airline
ownership and control issues.
The Australian authorities said they were not abandoning the proposed
liberalisation in principle, but 'freezing' the situation for the present.
In the short term, the row could make life easier for Qantas, which is due
to be privatised next year.
Mr Jim Bolger, New Zealand prime minister, said he was surprised at the way
Australia's aviation minister had told New Zealand the agreement was being
suspended. 'He advised us by fax. That is not the way to do business,' he
said. 'The decision doesn't stack up.'
Mr Bolger said that Australia had pressed for an open aviation market
between the two countries, and there were signed undertakings to ensure it
was carried out.
Opposition politicians in Australia also condemned the move, arguing that
the government had 'unilaterally torn up' the agreement and that such
behaviour would have broader consequences for Australia in international
negotiations.
Senator Warwick Parer, the opposition's aviation spokesman, said: 'Opponents
within Apec (the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum) now have a new
weapon to use to take Australia out of the game, or, at best, damage our
standing as a creditable negotiator and reliable signatory.'
The dispute means the Australian government's much-vaunted commitment to
'open skies' looks increasingly hollow. Deregulation of the domestic market
has prompted only one new national carrier to take to the skies, and it
quickly went out of business.
On the international front, passenger choices have also become more limited
as big US and European carriers have pulled out of Australia, and no new
Australian airlines have emerged.
In addition, BA and Qantas are seeking to 'co-ordinate' services on the
important UK-Australia routes, although this deal has yet to win Trade
Practices Commission approval.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Clinton aims to ease Israel-Syria deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's brief visit today to Damascus, only the second
undertaken by a US leader in 20 years, is rich in symbolism. But, as he
stressed yesterday, it may prove light on substantive moves to resolve
enduring differences between Israel, seeking a full peace with its
neighbour, and Syria, which wants a full return of the Israeli-occupied
Golan Heights in exchange.
'I expect we will make some progress to narrow the gap,' Mr Clinton said of
today's talks with President Hafez al-Assad, Syria's leader. 'But I do not
expect it to produce a dramatic breakthrough.'
Expectations for Mr Clinton's visit are running high in Damascus. 'There's a
popular feeling here that this could unjam things. The average Syrian seems
to believe this trip is about the most significant thing that could happen
just now,' a western diplomat in Damascus said.
Diplomats say the Syrians hope Mr Clinton may come bearing some Israeli
concession on the Golan, or may grant Mr Assad a long-sought bilateral
concession, such as erasing Syria from the list of states viewed in
Washington as sponsors of terrorism.
Mr Clinton has indicated neither is likely. 'Terrorism is still an issue
between our two countries,' he said yesterday. 'But the most successful way
to end terrorism in this part of the world is to have a comprehensive
peace'. His implicit message in visiting Mr Assad seems to be that such
prizes as removal from the terrorist list and further improvements in
US-Syrian relations can come, but only once the peace with Israel is sealed.
Mr Clinton's arrival in Damascus, a late addition to a regional swing built
around yesterday's Jordan-Israel peace ceremony, will be received in Syria
as the greatest possible acknowledgment of Mr Assad's regional stature and
Syria's importance to any lasting peace. 'The symbolism of that cannot but
help, even if it will not on its own produce the goods,' a diplomat said.
The trip will also underline what the tireless Middle East shuttling of Mr
Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, has made plain: that the US will
act as guarantor for any Syrian deal with Israel. Damascus, ever wary of
negotiating alone and directly with Jerusalem, has always needed this
assurance, adding to it repeated demands that Washington lean more heavily
on its Israeli ally. 'The US should ..take stands that put more pressure on
Israel to push the peace process,' Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, Syria's foreign
minister, said recently.
Mr Clinton's trip will affect the atmosphere surrounding the Syrian-Israeli
talks, the real progress of which both sides, aided by the supremely
tight-lipped Mr Christopher, have kept under wraps. It comes amid
ground-breaking gestures from Syria suggesting the climate for these talks
is warming. Mr al-Sharaa recently gave an unprecedented interview to Israeli
television. He also met US Jewish leaders during a recent US trip.
The most tangible result of Mr Clinton's visit, diplomats say, could be for
him to express Syria's ultimate willingness to embrace a full peace with
Israel, and what that peace would entail, more explicitly than Mr Assad is
so far prepared to do publicly. Possibly, Mr Clinton may be able to announce
plans for eventual direct talks between Mr al-Sharaa and Mr Shimon Peres,
his Israeli counterpart, a direct encounter long sought by the Israelis.
Otherwise, the substance of Israeli-Syrian negotiations will continue under
US auspices and through further US shuttles in and out of Damascus. Egyptian
officials and some diplomats in the region believe these talks may be only
months away from a basic agreed deal. Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak has
spoken of a deal by Christmas.
If so, then Mr Assad and Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin may be awaiting the
most propitious timing to make the political moves to clinch agreement. Mr
Assad's desire for a 'durable, comprehensive peace' makes it unlikely he
would commit himself to a deal with Israel if that with the Palestinians
looked to be failing.

FT  27 OCT 94 / US rivals clash over telecoms deal with PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROULA KHALAF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two US telecommunications giants both claimed this week they had clinched
exclusive agreements with Palestinian officials to provide phone services in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in a sign of disarray within Mr Yassir
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation, which has taken over
administration of the areas.
MCI said it had signed a contractual agreement with Patelco, a private
company implementing an exclusive 25-year telecommunications concession for
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, to provide international telephone network
capacity.
Mr Lawrence Kodacovi, senior vice-president of MCI, said Bezek, the Israeli
telecommunications company, had transferred the telecoms network to Patelco
in a ceremony on Tuesday attended by Mr Arafat.
But Palestinian officials based in Tunis said Mr Arafat was to announce an
AT&amp;T deal to develop a telecommunications nework in the same area, in an
agreement timed to coincide with the visit of President Clinton to the
region.
Both American companies are insistent their agreements will give them
exclusive rights to the Palestinian telecoms market.
Patelco would run and operate the telecommunications system in all
Palestinian areas, Mr Kodacovi said, and MCI would provide the network
capacity to link the Palestinian areas with the rest of the world.
The agreements were negotiated without public bidding or monitoring by
international consultants.
The confusion between the rival accords reflects a scramble for contracts
among senior PLO officials, and underlines concerns voiced by the US and
international donors about the need for more transparency in awarding
commercial contracts.
The principal shareholder in Patelco is International Technologies
Integration, a small American telecom consultancy owned by a Lebanese
engineer, which has joint ventures with MCI in Lebanon, Syria and Kuwait.
According to a contract seen by the Financial Times, ITI last October won a
25-year concession signed by Mr Arafat exclusively to build, operate and
exploit the domestic and international communications network in the West
Bank and Gaza.
But a rival group of PLO officials based in Tunis said they had signed an
agreement with AT&amp;T Network Systems International, a subsidiary of AT&amp;T
based in the Netherlands, to 'help develop and modernise the telecom network
in the territories' under control of the Palestinian Authority.
Mr Maher El Kurd, a senior PLO official in the office of Mr Farouk Kaddoumi,
chairman of Pecdar, the Palestinian institution charged with monitoring and
planning public-sector investments, said the AT&amp;T agreement 'will lead to an
arrangement under which AT&amp;T will build, operate and transfer a complete
network to the Palestinian Authority to support 225,000 subscribers'.
Mr Cees Steijger, head of corporate communications at AT&amp;T Network Systems,
said the 'co-operation agreement' would lead to a contract and AT&amp;T and the
Palestinian Authority would work together to set up feasibility plans to
develop the project.
AT&amp;T is now reviewing financing options requiring several hundred millions
of dollars.
According to Mr Steijger, AT&amp;T's agreement will include operating the
international network, which is what MCI says its own agreement with Patelco
stipulates.
A senior western diplomat said Mr Ron Brown, US commerce secretary, had
written to Mr Arafat expressing his concern over the award of the telecoms
contract, and asking Mr Arafat to institute a process of open public
bidding.
The rival agreement by AT&amp;T raises the stakes in the battle over the
telecoms contract and will fuel further controversy.
ITI says the contract it has, and the agreement with MCI, are irreversible;
it had started on implementation of a multi-year expansion plan worth
Dollars 140m with more than Dollars 30m of improvements in the first year
alone.
Mr Pierre Rizk, a Paris-based businessman who has been a key negotiator of
the ITI deal, insisted this week that the rivalry between the two US
companies was now over and that the inter-national telephone business would
go exclusively to MCI.
Mr Rizk denies any financial interest in any of the companies involved.
Mr Rizk said the transfer from Bezek to Patelco meant that last October's
25-year concession to ITI 'was legally binding on Israel, the Palestinian
Authority and all the telecommunications companies worldwide'.
Patelco had now bought the transmission equipment, existing switches,
cables, carriers and network remodes from Bezek. Bezek refused to comment.
Mr Rizk confirmed there had been US pressure on the Palestinian Authority
about the award of the contract but said it was a private business matter
which should not concern Washington as the deal involved no foreign aid.
AT&amp;T's Mr Steijger said he was surprised by MCI's announcement this week. 'I
don't know what to make of it,' he said.
'But the US government policy as given to us for American companies doing
business in the Palestinian territories lays down two principles:
accountability and transparency, and the vehicle for implementing these two
principles is Pecdar.'

FT  27 OCT 94 / PLO-Hamas strikers revile peace treaty with Jordan: Protests
greet Hussein's special role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Palestinian strikes and rallies held across the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and in Arab East Jerusalem yesterday were in protest at the
Israel-Jordan peace treaty, which recognises Jordan's historic custodial
role over Islamic sites in Jerusalem.
In a rare display of Palestinian political unity, Mr Yassir Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organisation called a strike jointly with the Islamic
resistance movement Hamas, closing schools and businesses to mourn
yesterday's signing ceremony.
In Hebron, up to 2,000 Palestinians took to the streets, shouting
anti-Jordan slogans and burning pictures of Jordan's King Hussein. Israeli
troops fired tear gas and bullets to disperse Palestinians stone-throwers in
the West Bank city of Nablus.
Palestinians are outraged at the treaty, which recognises King Hussein's
special role in Jerusalem's Islamic sites and in negotiations over the
future of the Holy City sacred to Moslems, Christians and Jews. The king
bases his claims to Jerusalem on assertions that his Hashemite monarchy is
directly descended from the Prophet Mohammed, said to have ascended to
heaven from Jerusalem's Temple Mount. The Dome of the Rock is said to mark
the spot and is the third holiest site in Islam.
The king opened a speech to the Jordanian parliament last Saturday defending
the peace treaty by calling for prayers and peace 'on the truthful Hashemite
Arab prophet and on his household'.
Jerusalem, he said, 'remains a trust with the Hashemites who are resolved on
its patronage and reconstruction and on the supervision of its holy sites.'
The Jerusalem controversy is the latest sign of a long history of tension
and animosity between King Hussein and Mr Arafat. King Hussein, whose
country includes 2m-3m Palestinians, once challenged Mr Arafat for
leadership of the Palestinian cause; the PLO believes the king has not yet
given up his ambition to influence the West Bank.
Under UN resolutions, Arab East Jerusalem, including the old city, is
defined as occupied territory seized by Israel in 1967. Palestinians want
Jerusalem as their future capital. They accuse Israel and Jordan of trying
to de-politicise the fate of Jerusalem and believe King Hussein has become a
willing partner of Israel to maintain its occupation. Israel claims
Jerusalem as its 'eternal and indivisible capital'.
The PLO and Jordan last week made rival appointments to the post of Mufti,
the highest Islamic authority in Jerusalem. In a speech last Saturday, which
angered Palestinians, King Hussein said: 'We will never relinquish our
religious responsibilities towards the holy sites'.
At the United Nations, the PLO also appealed for international support to
overturn the parts of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty relating to Jerusalem,
saying it violates UN resolutions and the Israel-PLO peace accords.
For decades, Palestinians have accorded Jerusalem a special symbolic
reverence. Photographs of the Dome of the Rock hang on the walls of almost
every PLO leader. In spray-canned graffiti across the Gaza Strip the Dome is
often depicted, symbolising the long-held Palestinian dream of a return to
their cherished homeland.
Mr Arafat, who was not invited to yesterday's ceremony by either Jordan or
Israel, on Tuesday blasted the Israel-Jordan agreement. 'Jerusalem is the
capital of Palestine, whether they like it or not. If they don't like it,
they can drink Gaza sea water,' he said, quoting an Arab proverb meaning he
did not care if his statements were accepted or not.
'I say to them: Jerusalem is not for sale,' he averred.
Hamas, usually at loggerheads with the secular PLO, has joined Mr Arafat's
condemnation of the deal, saying it opens the door for Israeli domination.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Chinese airlines struck by bruising losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese airlines are recording heavy and unprecedented losses in the face of
stiff competition from foreign carriers and the effects of a sharp rise in
operating costs.
The Economic Information Daily newspaper reported yesterday that China's
airlines were in a 'deep valley' with six out of the country's nine main
carriers reporting losses in the first eight months of the year.
The slide in Chinese airline fortunes risks slowing anticipated surging
demand for new aircraft, with Boeing and Airbus having geared up to supply
hundreds of aircraft over the next 15 years.
Economic Information Daily quoted aviation officials as calling for stricter
controls to be placed on new aeroplanes and new airlines. China had approved
some 28 airlines by early this year, but has instituted a freeze following a
series of crashes in 1993.
The newspaper said that in the first quarter Chinese airlines operating
domestic and international services from Beijing airport carried just 35 per
cent of passengers. An increasing proportion of Chinese preferred foreign
carriers to local airlines.
Chinese airlines suffered a serious drop in traffic on the lucrative Hong
Kong route with load factors plummeting 10 percentage points to 60 per cent
in the first quarter compared with last year's average. China's competitors
were flying near to capacity.
'A historical change occurred in China's aviation market late in 1993 when a
seller's market that had lasted for two decades turned into a buyer's
market,' Economic Information Daily reported.
China's airlines reported 20 per cent increases in passenger traffic in the
past two years, and this rate of growth was expected to continue for the
next four years, slowing to 15 per cent towards the end of the century.
The newspaper blamed the unification at the beginning of the year of China's
exchange rate resulting in an effective 50 per cent devaluation of the yuan
for some of the airlines' woes. The devaluation added dramatically to costs,
including leasing and fuel which rose by 25 per cent this year. Other
factors included a credit squeeze in mid-1993 aimed at slowing an
overheating economy.
The paper also blamed the poor safety record of Chinese airlines for the
fall-off in passenger numbers. China had at least four serious air crashes
in 1993 in what proved a disastrous year for Chinese aviation.
Aerospace companies, which have made heady forecasts of demand, may now be
obliged to revise their estimates. Boeing had predicted China would purchase
some 800 aircraft at a cost of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.3bn) by the year
2010, while Airbus had estimated a more conservative 620 aircraft.
A slowdown may also affect foreign airlines' plans to become involved in
joint ventures in China. The world's big carriers have been scouring China
for opportunities since Beijing announced early this year that it was
opening its aviation sector to foreign participation.

The arrival in France for medical treatment of Marshal Oh Jin-u, 77, North
Korea's defence minister, may provide an opportunity for Mr Kim Jong-il, the
country's new leader, to curb possible military opposition to his rule.
Marshal Oh, who ranks second behind Mr Kim, is believed to be suffering from
lung cancer and his trip to France indicates his condition has become
serious. He was a friend of the late President Kim Il-sung and is chief
representative of the conservative old guard that established North Korea in
the late 1940s. The defence ministry, in a show of independence, last month
publicly rejected a US demand for special inspections of suspected nuclear
facilities, which Pyongyang subsequently accepted in the recent accord.
Analysts believe Mr Kim may appoint Gen Oh Guk-ryol, who is seen as his
chief military supporter. Gen Oh advocates a more professional military by
reducing the role of political officers.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Patten says deal near on airport

<TEXT>
China and Hong Kong are on the verge of reaching agreement on financing the
territory's new airport, Mr Chris Patten, the UK colony's governor, said in
London last night. His statement at a dinner of the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council was his most optimistic comment yet on resolution of a
problem that has bedevilled relations between the two sides. Agreement on
the airport financing would be a significant breakthrough in relations.
'We have all but completed our discussions on the agreed minutes for the
financing of the new airport,' he said. Departing from his prepared text, he
said he was 'very confident' an announcement would be made 'in the next few
days'. 'That, I think, would be the very best signal that China and Britain
can co-operate to ensure the future economic prosperity of the territory.'
It would also be necessary to reach ancillary agreement with the mass
transit railway company and provisional airport authority, but he hoped that
would follow.
Mr Patten's speech was notable for its positive line on relations with
China. He stressed that Hong Kong and the UK had supported China's
aspiration to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation and argued
in favour of extension of most-favoured-nation status for China by the US.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Bouncing cheques shake up Taiwanese market's nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
In Taiwan, where reliable financial indicators are hard to come by, the
bounced cheque ratio moves markets. For the island's underground financiers
and above-ground brokers, yesterday's ratio announcement was bad news: a
10-month high at 0.58 per cent.
It was a report of a brokerage's bouncing cheque that prompted a 14.7 per
cent fall in stock prices earlier this month. For a Chinese society with
traditional regard for financial tangibles, defaulting on a cheque carries a
social penalty and, until a few years ago, was a criminal offence.
The ratio is compiled by the Central Bank of China, which measures the
bouncing by number of cheques issued and the total amount dishonoured. By
value, September's defaults reached 0.41 per cent of the total, the same as
August, which was the highest since November 1993.
Credit against post-dated cheques is the most common form of short-term
financing in Taiwan. The instrument is commonly used as collateral for loans
from underground financiers (black-market moneylenders) especially for share
purchases, hence the correlation between stock market confidence and the
rate of cheque defaults.
This month's share payment default scandal was started by a TDollars 200m
(Pounds 4.9m) bounced cheque from a local brokerage firm, presented to the
Taiwan Stock Exchange.
The episode set off a chain reaction among other brokerages and their
clientele, and the defaults over a couple of days were estimated at TDollars
7.6bn.
A US banker explained that a company's bounce history is an important source
of background information. Taiwan does not have an established credit
information or rating system, and checking records for defaults is one of
the few formal ways of assessing creditworthiness. The ratio, the banker
said, is akin to the bankruptcy rate in the US and an index of 'prosperity'
in a society that had hoarded foreign reserves of Dollars 90.99bn as at the
end of August.
Post-dated cheques have an important role. In Taiwan, the cheque is not just
used for paying the electricity bill. For instance, if equipment is leased
for three years, the lessee might sign 36 cheques totalling the agreed
amount, post-dated monthly, to cover the contract. Until 1987, defaulting on
a cheque was a criminal offence. The law was changed, but the power of the
paper and the stigma remain.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Hashimoto under fire for war remarks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's government was yesterday plunged into a dilemma over whether to sack
one of its most valuable cabinet ministers or risk a serious row with China.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, international trade and industry minister, yesterday
came under pressure from China to resign over recent remarks about the
second world war.
Mr Hashimoto had told parliament, in response to an opposition party
question, it was a matter of delicate definition whether Japan committed
aggression against its Asian neighbours during the war.
'Hashimoto's remarks thrust him into the centre of controversy over Japan's
continued reluctance to accept responsibility for the war, an issue that has
ended the careers of two ministers this year,' the official Xinhua news
agency said. South Korea said Mr Hashimoto's remark was regret-table.
If he is obliged to step down, the government will lose a senior figure in
holding together the three-party coalition of the conservative Liberal
Democratic party, left-wing Social Democratic party and the small
centre-left New Harbinger party.
Mr Hashimoto, a senior member of one of the LDP's main factions, is the
government's toughest trade negotiator and an important influence in
economic policy.
If he stays, the risks of a row with China are intensified when relations
between the two are already difficult.
China's relations with Japan became suddenly precarious several months ago,
when they were drawn into a protracted wrangle over the presence of senior
Taiwanese officials at the recent Asian Games in Hiroshima.
Mr Hashimoto irritated China again only last week by meeting his Taiwanese
counterpart, Japan's first formal ministerial meeting with Taiwan in 22
years. The ill-health of Mr Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese leader, contributes
to inflexibility among Beijing's leaders, unwilling to step out of the
official line when a power struggle may be imminent.
Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's socialist prime minister, has sought to defend
Mr Hashimoto's war remark, while the chief government spokesman, Mr Kozo
Igarashi, maintained yesterday that the comment was misreported.
The growing queue of Japanese ministers to lose their jobs for their views
on wartime history (four in the past eight years) is a testament to Japan's
continuing internal divisions over whether it was aggressor or victim.
Mr Hashimoto, 57, on the right wing of the LDP, represents an important
minority which feels that Japan's recent wartime apologies should not
diminish the honour of its war dead.
He heads an association of bereaved war families and leads a controversial
annual visit of LDP colleagues to the Yasukuni Shrine, where war heroes,
including some convicted war criminals, are remembered.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Businessman to be Thai minister
</HEADLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand's new foreign minister, whose appointment was confirmed yesterday
as part of a cabinet overhaul, is an unelected businessman whose corporate
involvements are prompting criticism that he is vulnerable to conflicts of
interest.
Mr Thaksin Shinawatra, 45, is one of the country's wealthiest and most
dynamic businessmen. His telecommunications empire has thrived on his
ability to win government contracts and franchises, and is expanding rapidly
in Thailand and the region.
He has been appointed because Mr Chamlong Srimuang, founder of the Palang
Dharma (Buddhist force) party, has risked seeing his political creation
break apart by replacing all of his party's 11 ministers in an attempt to
boost its popularity. The five coalition parties are permitted to fill their
cabinet allocations largely as they see fit.
Mr Vichit Surapongchai, former president of Bangkok Bank, picks up the
important transport and communications portfolio; this has caused less
comment because he is seen as a professional business manager brought in to
deal with a specialist field.
Mr Chamlong himself takes up formal political office - as a deputy prime
minister - for the first time since he was swept into power as a
corruption-fighting governor of Bangkok in the 1980s.
There are worries that Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, will have to use
all his diplomatic skills to prevent the unpredictable Mr Chamlong driving
the five-party coalition into crisis as he tries to score political points
over this government's final two years of its term.
Mr Thaksin has resigned as chairman of his Shinawatra group in favour of his
wife. But each retains 25 per cent of the holding company, Shinawatra
Computer &amp; Communications, which has a market capitalisation of Dollars
4.2bn (Pounds 2.58bn).
'If we interpret the constitution by the letter of the law, he is OK. But
the spirit of the law is that you don't want a person to hold high position
in order to benefit from it. This is a problem that could explode at any
time,' said Prof Likhit Dhiravegindra of Thammasat University's political
science faculty.
Mr Thaksin's predecessor as foreign minister, the former intelligence chief
Mr Prasong Soonsiri, is believed to be both furious and vengeful after being
dumped by his party leader for a fresh face.

The Independent Electoral Commission, which managed South Africa's national
and regional poll last April, has recommended to the government it urgently
implement a set of electoral reforms. The move comes amid rising concern
that South Africa's forthcoming local elections may have to be postponed
because of logistical difficulties. In a formal report released yesterday
the IEC admits that poor organisation and planning had forced it to jettison
many of its safeguards against possible voter fraud and ultimately included
large numbers of votes not properly verified in its final results.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Australian inflation at 1.9 percent
</HEADLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's consumer price index rose 0.6 per cent in the September quarter,
bringing the annualised inflation rate to 1.9 per cent.  The figure
represented little change from the previous quarter when the CPI rose 0.7
per cent, and the annualised rate stood at 1.7 per cent.  It was also in
line with market expectations, although some nervousness was generated
earlier in the week when the Reserve Bank of Australia increased interest
rates by one percentage point.  The move was interpreted as a pre-emptive
strike designed to keep inflation under control.
Despite the reassuring figures, bond prices weakened yesterday, with some
analysts suggesting the inflation figures may now deteriorate. They noted
that the severe drought gripping east coast farm areas has so far been
largely deflationary as farmers 'de-stock', but could have inflationary
consequences as produce supply tightens.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Airlines resume flights to India

Eleven airlines yesterday announced resumed flights to India after the World
Health Organisation declared most of the country plague-free.
Air India, the international carrier, has been allowed to resume its
services to Dubai and Doha, while Emirates (Dubai's airline), Gulf Air and
Kuwait Airways have also resumed their Indian services after nearly a month.
But Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and other members of the United Arab Emirates, as
well as Pakistan, Bangladesh and some Russian and central Asian countries,
have yet to lift the ban on flights.
The Indian government expressed relief when a team of WHO experts indicated
no evidence existed that plague had been transmitted in Bombay, Calcutta,
Madras or Delhi, and these cities could be considered plague-free. But the
UN organisation has recommended continued precautions while travelling to
Surat in Gujarat and Beed in Maharashtra.
The government has confirmed only 55 plague deaths, but health organisations
hope authorities will heed it as a warning to improve India's inadequate
health system.
Worst hit by the plague panic are exports of fresh food. Officials admit
that exports of perishables have fallen sharply, though no figures are yet
available. India depends on the Gulf countries for 70 per cent of its
exports of fruit, vegetables, meat, and seafood, which last year totalled
Dollars 177m (Pounds 118m), and were expected to reach Dollars 200m this
year. One estimate calculates the ban by Gulf countries has cost India more
than Dollars 6m a day.
Last year, trade between the Gulf states and India exceeded Dollars 3bn,
including Dollars 2bn-worth of Indian exports. 'We have lost over a month of
business due to the plague scare,' says Mr Bilal Lone, who imports
non-ferrous metal scrap from the Gulf to India.
The Indian Commerce ministry is optimistic that trade with the Middle East
will return to normal with the restored air and sea links. 'The specific
impact of the plague scare on trade will be clear when the figures for
October are released next month,' a ministry official said.
Travel experts estimate cancellations of up to 40 per cent of tourism
arrivals this year, the plague scare having coincided with the peak tourist
season. 'India's plans to increase tourism arrivals from 1.82m in 1993 to 5m
by the year 2000 have been badly hit,' a tourism ministry official said.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Moscow seeks ways to limit Arctic oil spill damage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   MOSCOW, OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian officials flew to the northern region of Komi yesterday to take
charge of the operation to bring under control an oil spill that
environmentalists say could have a disastrous impact on the fragile Arctic
environment.
There is growing concern that winter snow could soon prevent any clean-up of
oil slicks blanketing vast areas of tundra. 'If something has to be done, it
has to be done right now,' said Ms Valentina Semyashkina, head of a
conservation group for the Pechora River. Oil has spilled into a tributary
of the Pechora, Europe's richest salmon river, and may reach it.
She said oil leaking into the river, over 1,000km north-east of Moscow,
could pour into the Barents Sea. 'This has happened before,' she said. The
spillage occurred on October 1 when heavy rains caused the collapse of a
reservoir containing oil that had leaked from a pipeline near the town of
Usinsk.
Meanwhile, doubts grew yesterday over US estimates that the spill could be
one of the biggest ever. 'There are all these fairy stories about a leak of
200,000 tonnes of oil - that is what oil workers there produce in one month.
It is stupid,' said Mr Nikolai Balin, head of the Komi state committee for
environment. 'The most plausible figure is 14,000 tonnes.'
In Norway, which closely monitors Russian oil spills, officials said there
were no plans to lend assistance to the area unless requested by Moscow.
'We do not at the moment see any acute threat to the Barents Sea,' said Mr
Per Antonsen, an adviser at the Norwegian environment ministry in charge of
disaster co-operation with Russia.
'We are alarmed by the spill, but we have to make our priorities. This is a
minor spill compared with what has occurred on the Yamal Peninsula. We have
to remain calm and await further information,' he said.
Norwegian officials said yesterday they had received a report from Moscow
estimating that between 14,000 tonnes and 60,000 tonnes of oil had leaked
from a pipeline covering an area of 68sq km. They believed that 14,000
tonnes was not enough to cover such a large area and that the scope of the
oil spill was probably closer to 60,000 tonnes. One US estimate has the
spill at 200,000 tonnes, but the Norwegians regard this figure as an
exaggeration.
Moscow told Norway yesterday that about 140 people from the Komi civil
defence had been working with buckets and vacuum pipes to contain the spill,
but had to abandon clean-up work because of cold weather, ice and snow.
Officials in Oslo do not believe the oil will reach the Pechora river,
though there are concerns about this possibility arising during the spring
thaw.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Challenge to Russian democracy on the waterfront: John Lloyd
reports from the Pacific port of Vladivostok, where both organised crime and
the local governor appear out of control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PORT OF VLADIVOSTOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
They drive through the streets in Japanese four-wheel drive vehicles, groups
of tough young men with cropped hair and leather jackets - the uniform of
the gang enforcers. Welcome to Vladivostok, Russia's famed port on the
Pacific, where organised crime gangs are hugely powerful and are battling it
out for control of port facilities, companies and retail outlets.
In the elegantly restored Versailles Hotel, in the town centre, visiting
businessmen speak of all deals having to go through one or other of the
local crime families: of nightly shootings; of a wholly corrupt police
force.
This is the menacing setting for a drama of great importance in the
development of Russian democracy.
The governor of the Primorye region, of which Vladivostok is the capital, Mr
Evgeny Nazdratenko, has been accused of corrupt and dictatorial rule - by
local people, by those claiming to be his victims and by external experts.
These claims have not, however, been tested in court: they remain a vast,
but unproven, indictment of the effectiveness of Russian regional and
central government.
On one night last week, Mr Alexander Sviridov, whose Sab corporation was
about to open a diamond exchange in the city, was killed in what the
Interfax news agency said was probably a mafia killing. Earlier on the same
day, Mr Vladimir Cherepkov, son of Mr Victor Cherepkov, Vladivostok's former
mayor, was sentenced to seven years in prison for the theft of a computer
from his school.
According to opponents to his rule, these disparate events are connected to
the central actor in the drama of Vladivostok, Governor Nazdratenko. Mr
Nazdratenko was to have stood for election as governor on October 7 (he is
presently appointed by President Boris Yeltsin): but the vote was cancelled
by a decree issued by Mr Yeltsin last month.
The vote was called off immediately after the receipt of a report, written
by experts from the Russia's Choice party (led by Mr Yegor Gaidar) which
said that Primorye was 'in the grip of fear'; it alleged that Mr Nazdratenko
had terrorised political opponents, closed opposition newspapers, taken
shares with associates in the bulk of the privatised enterprises and - in
his vendetta against former Mayor Cherepkov - trumped up the theft charges
against his son after dismissing the father from office on false charges of
accepting bribes.
According to Mr Igor Sanachev, a former official under Mr Cherepkov,
'Nazdratenko had all the means to ensure that he won the election'. This is
a judgment shared by others who would not give their names. This assumption
of intended ballot-rigging or intimidation was the reason the opposition
pressed for a postponement of the election for governor.
Mr Sanachev goes further: cancelling the election deprived Mr Nazdratenko of
his only chance to survive - the chance of gaining the people's mandate.
Now, he believes: 'He has served his purpose and he has to go.'
That purpose, according to Mr Sanachev and the Russia's Choice report, was
to provide an administration which would allow the directors of the large
plants to get rich through privatisation and through misuse of government
funds. For the past three years, according to Mr Sanachev and the Russia's
Choice investigators, Mr Nazdratenko and his allies in a group named 'PAKT',
had so dominated the privatisation process as to ensure that the largest
single portion of shares came to them as directors of the enterprises
privatised.
The investigators claimed the 'PAKT' group had also gained control of the
regional administration and systematically suppressed opposition; had,
through the administration, threatened to declare 'autonomy' as a Far
Eastern Republic in order to cajole more support out of Moscow; and diverted
and misused state funding so efficiently that services are only sporadically
provided and workers go up to six months without pay.
Mr Nazdratenko was too ill to be interviewed: his deputy governor, Mr
Nikolai Pimenov, insisted that corruption was not a problem in the
administration and that 'autonomy' was simply a desire to agree with Moscow
on a special economic status for the region, of the type other regions and
republics enjoyed.
But according to the former mayor, Mr Cherepkov, the administration is
ruthless. Elected as mayor last year on an anti-Nazdratenko ticket, he was
physically removed from his office in May and a substitute mayor put in his
place. His son was arrested and charged with the theft. Last Friday, he
received seven years' jail - a savage punishment which, his father said,
'all agree was a punishment not for him but for the Cherepkov family'. Mr
Cherepkov says that the judge is a close ally of Mr Nazdratenko and squarely
blames the governor for manipulating the case.
He is, however, fighting back. He has already collected 20,000 signatures in
protest against the sentence and says he will take the case to Moscow, to
President Yeltsin.
But among the crime, corruption and violence, business grows. Mr Sergei
Frank is the finance director of Fesco, a privatised shipping line which
operates a fleet of more than 160 merchant ships. He oversees a company
which, he says, is 'free of debt with the capacity to improve the quality of
the fleet and the efficiency of our operations'. Its shares trade at Dollars
90, giving it a market capitalisation of Dollars 146m (compared with an
implied valuation when first privatised of Dollars 4.4m), and he expects a
net profit of around Dollars 90m this year.
Some 15 per cent of his company is now held by foreign investors, of which
Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) and Citibank are the largest: CSFB's
research note on the company says its prospects are 'inspiring'.
Mr Frank will not be drawn too far into comments on the region's
administration: by most accounts, Fesco has remained free of the 'PAKT'
network and of the organised crime groups. 'The mafia is concerned with cash
businesses: we work with bank accounts. The administration, I would say, is
neither very competent nor incompetent: we pay taxes, it doesn't interfere.'
Mr Frank's cautious view that the administration allows business to develop
is confirmed by Mr Andrew Fox, a young British financier who came to the
region two years ago. He has created two investment funds, set up a company
which trades on the stock exchange and is investing his own and his
partners' money in local enterprises.
'There are some extremely profitable companies here whose shares are
increasing in value very rapidly indeed,' he says, citing a huge cement
plant whose output is greater than that of Australia's.
Mr Fox acknowledges the pervasiveness of the mafia and of violence but,
making the same point as Mr Frank, says he runs a cashless business and
avoids trouble. 'People tell me we could make a lot of money opening
restaurants or laundries. We could, but then you're in the mafia territory.'
Mr Nazdratenko's continued rule in the region may now be in doubt: the
members of 'PAKT', bosses of the big local enterprises, are now mainly rich
men though many of their workers have no work and little wages and the
organisation is riven with infighting.
In the short term, however, disillusion with democracy, perhaps even
encouraged by Mr Nazdratenko's hold over the region, may further empower
him. Last weekend an election to the Primorye parliament failed when not
enough people turned out to vote. Only 20 deputies were elected to the
39-seat parliament, six fewer than the quorum required. Now, Mr Nazdratenko
will be able to run the region without a legislature until new parliamentary
elections, probably next year.

<TEXT>
Thousands of German workers chanting 'out with the management' yesterday
protested against job-cutting plans by optical equipment maker Carl Zeiss
and demanded that the company's board quit. Mr Edwin Michler, head of the
loss-making company's works council, told 4,500 jeering demonstrators at the
Zeiss Oberkochen plant in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg the board
was not providing enough information about its plans. Zeiss, once renowned
for its paternalistic management, wants to shed 3,000 out of 15,900 jobs in
plants in east and west Germany by withdrawing from unprofitable business
areas to save about DM250m (Pounds 102m) by 1996. Mr Michler accused the
board of making contradictory statements about the future of various
factories.
Zeiss management board chairman Mr Jobst Herrmann announced last week he
planned to resign. The group lost DM180m in 1993/94 mainly in east Germany's
Jena branch. Carl Zeiss Jena, once a showpiece industry of communist East
Germany, was mostly taken over by Carl Zeiss Oberkochen in a deal hailed at
the time as rescuing the company from bankruptcy. The original Zeiss company
was split by the division of Germany after the second world war.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Confusion over rouble support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The deputy chairman of Russia's central bank yesterday said it would no
longer intervene on the foreign exchange markets to support the rouble - a
policy it followed for much of this year at great cost. 'The reserves of the
central bank are sufficient only to support five or six days of
interventions on Moscow's Interbank Currency Exchange,' Mr Alexander
Khandruyev told an international conference in London. 'In August, foreign
exchange reserves were Dollars 5.2bn. Now we have Dollars 1.7bn-Dollars
1.8bn left. What do we do next?' However, his comments contradicted those
made earlier this week by Tatyana Paramonova, the new head of the central
bank, who succeeded Mr Victor Gerashchenko when he resigned after the rouble
collapsed after the central bank abandoned its support. She pledged:
'Foreign currency reserves, of which the Central Bank of Russia is not the
only holder, will be used to defend the rouble rate.'
The rouble's 21 per cent plunge against the dollar on October 11 sent that
week's inflation rate to a one-year high. Inflation jumped to 6.8 per cent,
the highest rate since September 1993, up sharply from the previous week's
rate of 2.7 per cent.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Berlusconi eases pensions pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Berlusconi government yesterday agreed on a new decree to ease hardship
caused by Italy's pension reform proposals in the 1995 budget. Mr Clemente
Mastella, the labour minister, said 100,000 persons were affected and the
extra cost in 1995 would be L600bn (Pounds 240m). The expense would be met
from a treasury contingency fund. The cost of the amendments is lower than
first projected; this is largely because the government has shifted the
biggest burden of the changes on to the 1996 and 1997 budgets. The
government decided to soften some aspects of pension reform in the wake of
the huge nationwide demonstrations organised by the trade unions.
The main hardship cases concern those who retired early hoping to collect
more generous pensions next year by escaping expected benefit cuts. They
risked being trapped by a government decision to stop paying pensions for
the first six months of retirement to people who retired between September
and February 1995. Now those with 37 years' contributions by July will have
full access to their pensions. The government will also remove the penalty
for those retiring early if their retirement is postponed to 1996 or, in the
case of less than 30 years' contributions, to 1997.

Italy's former communists, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), is facing

which the PDS says is government-inspired, centres on public works contracts
awarded in Sicily during the 1980s to communist co-operatives. Over the last
two years magistrates in Sicily have arrested hundreds of businessmen and
politicians on corruption charges relating to distribution of lucrative
public works contracts. But this is the first time the PDS has been
targeted. Mr Massimo D'Alema, the PDS leader, accused the government of
orchestrating a campaign to discredit Italy's largest opposition party. The
move is seen by some as an attempt to draw the main opposition party into
the corruption scandal in an attempt to win support for a political
'solution' to end the investigations.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Iberia tries to avert strikes as financial crisis grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Management of Iberia, the Spanish state-owned airline, will meet unions
today and tomorrow in a final effort to avert strikes planned for next month
at the financially crippled flag-carrier.
Iberia is seeking to become viable through drastic cost-cutting and by an
injection of public funds. The airline wants to cut salaries by an average
of 15 per cent over the next two years and the Madrid government is to ask
the European Union to permit the injection of at least Pta125bn (Pounds
615m) in new capital.
Iberia said yesterday that unless agreement was obtained over the salary
cuts and the capital injection, the airline would be technically bankrupt by
spring.
Unions have nevertheless called strikes over a separate issue linked to
Iberia's refusal to make up back pay that is due at the end of this month
under the terms of a salary agreement dating back to August last year.
Twenty-four hour strikes are scheduled for November 3 and 11.
Iberia is on course to lose Pta44bn this year. The salary reductions, along
with additional measures, including shedding 2,120 jobs from the 24,456
labour force, seek to save Pta32.3bn. The the back-pay agreement, which
Iberia says it is in no position to honour, represents an additional cost of
Pta17bn.
In an effort to stem its losses, Iberia has renegotiated with Airbus, the
European aircraft manufacturing consortium, the Pta109bn purchase of eight
A-340 long-range aircraft which were due for delivery over the next three
years. Under a recent agreement Iberia will lease four of the aircraft and
will delay the acquisition of the other four.
The airline is now negotiating the cancellation of a second contract, worth
Pta69bn, involving the acquisition of eight A-321 aircraft, a smaller,
short-range Airbus. 'We can't buy them because we can't pay for them; it is
as simple as that,' an Iberia spokesman said.
Iberia says that unless it has first managed radically to overhaul its
spending, the government will be unable to negotiate new funds for the
airline in Brussels. The company was last recapitalised by INI, the
public-sector holding company, in 1992 when Brussels authorised subsidies
totalling Pta120bn on condition that no more public money be made available
until 1996.
The company's losses over the past four years, which have in part been
linked to an ambitious airline investment programme in Latin America, have
effectively wiped out the 1992 capital injection.

FT  27 OCT 94 / France ponders superhighway gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
From the network of trains a grande vitesse to the construction of a new
national library, France has a penchant for grands projets. Today, the
government will consider a project which could rank with the grandest - the
creation of a national autoroute d'information, a gallic information
superhighway.
Ministers from the relevant departments of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's
government meet this afternoon to discuss a long-awaited report from Mr
Gerard Thery, a former managing director of France Telecom and an architect
of the Minitel project, the teletext system which now has more than 23,000
services.
Like Minitel at its launch in 1979, Mr Thery's new project is ambitious. His
report proposes the establishment of a network of fibre optic cables linking
every household by 2015. The aim is to build a national infrastructure
allowing the French public and businesses to connect to a network of
interactive television, telephone entertainment and data services.
According to Mr Thery, the cost of the infrastructure alone would be between
FFr150bn (Pounds 18bn) and FFr200bn (Pounds 24bn) by the year 2015. Much of
the investment, he argues, should be borne by France Telecom, which should
switch resources from copper telephone lines to the fibre optic cables
needed for the superhighway.
'We are behind not only the US, but also our main partner, Germany,' he
says, citing the Opal project, which will provide fibre optic connections to
1.2m east Germans by 1996.
The message strikes a chord with the French government. But it has yet to
decide how far Mr Thery's ambitious proposals will be transformed into
reality.
In his letter commissioning the report, Mr Balladur asked Mr Thery in
February to 'elucidate' the objectives for France in the area of information
superhighways. Officials say the study will lead the debate but that it is
not a blueprint for legislation.
But Mr Thery's proposals have also drawn criticism. 'There is little
analysis of the role of competitors,' says one industry analyst. 'Telecoms
markets are in the process of liberalisation, but there is no mention of any
other players except France Telecom.'
The report also skirts the issue of how France's programme should relate to
that being studied by the European Commission. In particular, Mr Martin
Bangemann, the industry commissioner is proposing that private companies
rather than governments should take the lead in the development of a
European information superhighway.
Some EU member states are pressing for national operators to surrender their
monopolies over their national infrastructure. In France, communications and
utilities groups such as Bouygues and Generale des Eaux are pressing for
increased access to the telecoms market.
More serious, given the central role it has been prescribed by Mr Thery, are
the reservations expressed by France Telecom. The state operator is wary of
such a bold investment in infrastructure. Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman, says:
'Rather than put in place immediately a colossal infrastructure, let us
focus on the contents, namely the programmes, which we will be able to offer
our future clients.'
Behind such sentiments lies a worrying precedent - the Plan Cable. Launched
in 1982, the plan committed FFr25bn to create a state of the art cable
network. But competition from more terrestrial and satellite TV
broadcasters, the high cost of subscriptions and the lack of services have
all limited demand. France still has one of the lowest rates of cable
penetration in Europe.
'France made just about every mistake in cable that it was possible to
make,' says Mr Gerard Eymery, chairman of the multimedia operations of
France Telecom.
The task for ministers today is how to plot a path so that the next grand
projet of the information era is not such a grand failure.

<TEXT>
Italy's former communists, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), is facing
a major corruption investigation for the first time. The investigation,
which the PDS says is government-inspired, centres on public works contracts
awarded in Sicily during the 1980s to communist co-operatives.
Over the last two years magistrates in Sicily have arrested hundreds of
businessmen and politicians on corruption charges relating to distribution
of lucrative public works contracts. But this is the first time the PDS has
been targeted. Mr Massimo D'Alema, the PDS leader, accused the government of
orchestrating a campaign to discredit Italy's largest opposition party.
Milan magistrates have undoubtedly singled out premier Silvio Berlusconi's
Fininvest business empire in their anti-corruption inquiries. Nonetheless,
the PDS has always defended the magistrates' independence against accusation
of political bias.
The Sicilian investigation has unusual aspects. It stems from an anonymous
denunciation and is being pursued by the carabinieri rather than the
judiciary. On Friday the carabinieri asked PDS headquarters in Palermo for a
list of all officials dating back to 1980, and co-operatives' offices for a
list of all public works contracts in the same period. Earlier, Mr Cesare
Previti, defence minister, had hinted the judiciary would soon be turning
their attention to the 'red trail'. And at the weekend Mr Giulio Maceratini,
head of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance in the senate, invited the
carabinieri to search the PDS' Rome headquarters.
The Berlusconi government believes anti-corruption investigations since 1992
have focused little on the PDS and its predecessor, the Communist Party of
Italy. Ms Tiziana Parenti, now a parliamentary deputy for Mr Berlusconi's
Forza Italia, left the Milan magistrates' anti-corruption team because of a
disagreement on this issue.
The matter is one of the complaints against Milan magistrates now being
investigated by a special team of inspectors from the justice ministry.
These complaints mainly concern the handling of inquiries into the Fininvest
group.
Several members of parliament said yesterday in private they did not doubt
that most public works contracts in Sicily had been subject to
irregularities. But they suggested the move against the PDS was an attempt
to ensure government and opposition were seen to be equally entangled in
corruption inquiries. This would increase pressure for a political solution
to end the investigations.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: German inflation falls to 2.8%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inflation in west Germany eased to 2.8 per cent a year in the month to
mid-October from 3 per cent in the previous month, according to preliminary
data from the federal statistics office. Prices increased just 0.1 per cent
in the review period, when rents and the cost of services eased and seasonal
food bills rose by less than expected. The data should soothe market fears
of any monetary tightening by the Bundesbank, but did not pave the way for
an automatic reduction in interest rates, said Mr Richard Reid, senior
economist at the Union bank of Switzerland's Frankfurt office. Mr Reid,
noting that the strong D-Mark had deflected any upwards pressure from import
prices, expected inflation to continue falling. After hitting 2.3 per cent
in January it could reach 2 per cent by late summer.
Denmark's preliminary unadjusted trade surplus was DKr4.05bn (Pounds 425m)
in August compared with DKr3.17bn in July. The unadjusted trade surplus for
January to August fell to DKr23.7bn compared with DKr26.7bn for the previous
year. Portugal's retail sales index rose 1.8 per cent in the 12 months to
June, the National Statistics Institute said.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Israeli accord with Jordan ends 46 years of hostility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE On the Israel-Jordan Border and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and Jordan signed a formal peace agreement on their barren border
yesterday in a desert ceremony with blessings taken from the holy books to
mark the end of 46 years of hostility.
'It is not just the end of war but the beginning of new co-operation,' Mr
Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, told the 5,000 guests. 'Let's dream
together. We've got the licence.'
The treaty demarcates the two countries' borders, resolving disputed water
claims and fixing security and environmental arrangements. The two nations
will exchange ambassadors within a month and begin ambitious joint economic
projects.
President Bill Clinton, who attended the ceremony, praised King Hussein of
Jordan and Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and said the treaty
had broken the chains that had kept the two countries in the shadow of
strife and suffering.
'Here in this region which is the home of not only both your faiths but mine
I say: Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit the earth,' said
Mr Clinton, who signed the treaty along with Mr Rabin and Mr Abdul-Salam
al-Majali.
Mr Rabin said: 'The peace that was born today gives us all the hope that the
children born today will never know war between us and their mothers will
know no sorrow.'
Symbolic gestures of reconciliation between former warriors dominated the
open-air ceremony. One Israeli in a wheelchair, wounded by Jordanians in the
1967 battle for Jerusalem, wept as Israeli and Jordanian marching bands
rubbed shoulders and played their respective national anthems. An Israeli
girl and a Jordanian girl, whose grandfathers were killed in the 1967 war,
gave flowers to Mr Rabin, King Hussein and Mr Clinton. The Israeli and
Jordanian chiefs of staff together with commanders of the air force, navy
and southern fronts shook hands and exchanged gifts.
But even as the ceremony took place, Jewish settlers claimed that Arab
gunmen had kidnapped an Israeli youth in the West Bank, while Palestinians
opposed to the treaty held rallies across the West Bank and burnt pictures
of King Hussein. The Lebanese Islamic extremist Hizbollah group sent mortar
fire crashing into northern Israel and denounced the treaty as 'a grand
crime and treachery'.
Mark Nicholson adds from Cairo: Earlier yesterday, Mr Clinton held talks in
Cairo with President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, and Mr Yassir
Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, after which the
US president said he was satisfied with Mr Arafat's undertakings to combat
the threat to the peace process posed by Hamas, the militant Islamic
Palestinian group.
Calling this a 'matter of great urgency', Mr Clinton told reporters that he
received a 'very firm and unambiguous response' from the Palestinian leader.
'Chairman Arafat said he would continue to do all that he could to combat
terrorism, specifically Hamas, but other groups as well. I'm satisfied with
the response that he gave.'
Mr Clinton added: 'I believe that he understands that Hamas is his enemy now
and that once you become a partner in the peace process, you have to fight
for peace.' Mr Arafat slipped away from the talks before yesterday's press
conference.
The US president also said he would head economic efforts to help Israel and
the Palestinians during the next phases of their peace agreement.

FT  27 OCT 94 / UK traffic growth curb urged by commission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent, and DAVID LASCELLES,
Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A radical overhaul of Britain's transport policies to curb ever-growing road
traffic was called for yesterday by the Royal Commission on Environmental
Pollution.
In a long-awaited, 300-page report, the commission said Britain's present
approach to transport was unsustainable, and urgent action - including a
doubling of petrol tax and a halving of spending on new main roads - was
needed to avoid unacceptable levels of environmental damage in the early
decades of the next century.
The report contains 110 recommendations, the main thrust being to load costs
on to road transport and encourage a shift to public transport and 'green'
modes such as cycling and walking.
It also calls for more effective planning to reduce the need for transport,
tougher controls on vehicle pollution and greater regard for the environment
in the design of transport schemes. However, it emphasises that policies
should provide for the car.
The report received a guarded welcome from the government, whose policies
are challenged by most of the main conclusions. Dr Brian Mawhinney,
transport secretary, said: 'I welcome this report as an important
contribution to the broader debate which I want to encourage on how we are
going to balance the economic benefits and personal freedom that roads can
bring with the need for environmental protection.'
Among the main proposals are:
Halve spending on motorways and other main roads to allow a near doubling of
public transport investment.
Double the price of motor fuel in real terms by 2005. That would raise
industry's costs by 1 per cent over the next 10 years.
Agree tighter European Union emission limits for all new vehicles.
Increase excise duty on heavy vehicles according to the level of emissions
they produce.
Ban super unleaded petrol. Reduce petrol's permitted benzene content because
of fears about its cancer-causing effects.
The report, by 16 scientists and environmental experts, takes as its basis
the government's commitment to environmentally sustainable economic growth.
The overall aim is to limit traffic growth to 10 per cent a decade and to
reduce the environmental impact of journeys.
With 20m vehicles already on Britain's roads and traffic levels forecast to
double by 2025, current high levels of road building will not stop
congestion worsening, the commission says.
It urges total spending on public transport of Pounds 4.5bn a year but says
higher fuel duties would raise Pounds 6.5bn while cuts in the roads
programme would yield a further Pounds 1.5bn. It recommends 'demanding but
achievable' targets for improving air quality, reducing road deaths and
noise and switching travel from roads to other means.
The Environment Department is pleased with the main thrust of the report.
The commission - unusually - is a permanent body which has produced a series
of weighty reports since being set up in 1969. Its studies of nuclear power
and diesel emissions influenced government policy.
Yesterday's recommendations were criticised by business and motoring
organisations, while environmental and pro-rail groups welcomed its the
findings. Greenpeace said it was 'a watershed in the battle against
subsidised pollution'.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Hamilton linked to companies probed by SFO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, PEGGY HOLLINGER and WILLIAM LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Hamilton, who resigned as corporate affairs minister on Tuesday, was
a director of a company linked to a group of companies investigated by the
Serious Fraud Office.
A colleague of Mr Hamilton said yesterday that Downing Street was likely to
have been made aware of the SFO probe and that this may have contributed to
Mr John Major's decision to ask him to resign. There is no suggestion that
Mr Hamilton himself has been investigated.
'The disclosure would have been particularly embarrassing to him, given that
he is corporate affairs minister at the DTI,' said a Conservative colleague.
From January 17 to September 30 1990, Mr Hamilton was a director of Plateau
Mining, a gold mining company. Plateau had previously been owned by
Robertson Group, the mining consultancy, whose activities have been examined
by the SFO as part of its probe into natural resource companies connected to
Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith.
Mr Hamilton joined Plateau's board when Robertson floated the company on the
Stock Exchange. He resigned when he joined the government as a whip.
Plateau's shares came to market at a price of 90p, valuing the group at
Pounds 16.8m. In August 1992, Plateau's shares were suspended at 3p and
eight months later it was taken over at 6p a share.
The SFO is investigating the flotations of Butte Mining and Richmond Oil and
Gas. When Butte bought properties in 1988, Robertson appraised the assets
and after the acquisition had a 14.9 per cent holding in Butte.
On Tuesday, Mr Hamilton was told at a meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, the
trade secretary, and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, that allegations had
been sent to Downing Street relating to Plateau.
Mr Heseltine and Mr Ryder told him they felt his ability to carry out his
duties would be impaired by the need to answer these allegations and others.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Citibank proposes limited liability for Lloyd's Names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A plan that could bring further sweeping changes to Lloyd's of London by
allowing many Names to trade in the insurance market on the basis of limited
liability was unveiled yesterday.
Citibank, the subsidiary of US group Citicorp, announced proposals that
would enable Names to convert from unlimited liability - the
long-established system of trading - without breaking Lloyd's rules.
The proposals, drawn up with members' agencies which look after Names'
interests, could lead to a further reduction in the number of traditional
Names, the individuals whose assets have historically supported the Lloyd's
insurance market.
Names have been hit by heavy losses in recent years and the number actively
underwriting has fallen from 32,000 in 1988 to less than 18,000 this year.
Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, said yesterday that most
Lloyd's Names may convert in the next few years - though higher returns
offered by unlimited liability would continue to attract a minority.
'There will be a strong caucus - perhaps 3,500 - who will opt to remain
exactly as they are, on unlimited liability,' he said.
Citibank's proposals await approval by Lloyd's authorities but have been
drawn up in consultation with its officials. The plan will be considered by
Lloyd's on November 4.
Main features include a 'reinsurance' agreement by which Names would
transfer liabilities outstanding on policies they have underwritten
previously to an individual company, or 'Name-Co'. This would not isolate
them completely from past exposures but offer some protection.
Lloyd's has agreed that NameCos should hold a minimum of Pounds 100,000 at
the insurance market, compared with the Pounds 1.5m required from companies
set up in the past few years to inject corporate capital into the market.
To make the scheme more attractive, Citibank has arranged for some of those
taking up the scheme to buy a separate reinsurance policy which will have
the effect of increasing their funds held at Lloyd's - allowing them to
underwrite more business.
If substantial numbers of Names transfer to limited liability, the process
could become unstoppable. A dwindling number of unlimited liability Names
would, in effect, become insurers of last resort. They might therefore want
to convert as well.
At an Association of Lloyd's Members conference yesterday, Mr Middleton said
to avoid that problem the insurance market needed transitional arrangements
leading to a strengthening of assets available to Lloyd's.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Aitken was fourth minister in cabinet inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jonathan Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, identified himself last night
as the fourth minister investigated in an inquiry by Sir Robin Butler,
cabinet secretary, into allegations of impropriety.
In a Treasury statement, Mr Aitken said he had 'never been guilty of any
impropriety in the conduct of any of my responsibilities as a minister or
MP'. He said he had never met Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods, 'or
had any dealings with him or anyone acting on his behalf'.
Downing Street said no other ministers were involved in the inquiry,
established by Mr John Major to investigate allegations made by an unnamed
intermediary allegedly acting for Mr Fayed.
Mr Aitken's statement followed a similar acknowledgement by Mr Michael
Howard, home secretary. Both were cleared of all impropriety. Downing Street
refuses to disclose the allegations or to name the informant.
In an effort to draw a line under the allegations of impropriety that have
dogged the government, Mr Major will today announce details of a standing
committee being set up to draw up standards for public life.
Mr Major, who had 45 minutes of talks at Downing Street last night with Lord
Nolan, the committee chairman, is expected to appoint eight to ten prominent
people. The prime minister will also announce a replacement for Mr Neil
Hamilton, the former corporate affairs minister, who was dismissed on
Tuesday after Mr Major said fresh allegations had been made against him.
Mr Hamilton was cleared by Sir Robin of earlier allegations that he had
accepted payment to place parliamentary questions. Mr Tim Smith, the other
minister investigated by Sir Robin, resigned last week after admitting
accepting payment.
Amid continuing unease among Tory right-wingers about the sacking of Mr
Hamilton, Labour sought to exploit the government's discomfort by demanding
full details of the charges against him.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, told Mr Major in a
letter: 'It is essential that MPs and the general public are told the whole
truth, and not just presented with a parody of open government. 'Adding to
the government's discomfort, Mr Fayed said Mr Major's Commons statement,
which amounted to a claim that he had tried to blackmail the government, was
based on hearsay evidence.
Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, disclosed that a
note summarising a conversation between Mr Major and the alleged
intermediary of Mr Fayed on September 29 was not passed to her office until
last Thursday.
That was the day on which The Guardian published allegations that Mr
Hamilton and Mr Smith accepted payment from Mr Fayed for asking Commons
questions.
As Downing Street steadfastly refused to shed further light on the remaining
charges against Mr Hamilton, further details emerged from friends of the
former minister. They said he was confronted with an allegation that he had
failed to disclose a consultancy with Mobil Oil and a separate allegation
about his relationship with Plateau Mining.
The government was also said to have received an anonymous letter alleging
that Mr Hamilton had avoided paying taxes.
The friends said Mr Hamilton was 'dismayed' by the prime minister's
treatment of him, but was not planning a bitter Commons resignation speech.
He expects to return to the government after disproving all the allegations.
Some of the allegations may be considered by the Commons privileges
committee. Labour MPs, who walked out after the Tory majority decided to sit
in secret, appear willing to return if some sessions are held in public.
Negotiations between Labour and Mr Tony Newton, the committee chairman, have
so far failed to produce a deal.

FT  27 OCT 94 / Opposition leaders pile pressure on Major over sleaze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, ROBERT PESTON and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opposition leaders stepped up pressure on the government yesterday as Mr
John Major sought to draw a line under the cash-for-questions controversy by
meeting Lord Nolan, chairman of the nascent standing committee on standards
in public life, at Downing Street to discuss his remit.
Amid continuing unease among Tory right-wingers about the dismissal of Mr
Neil Hamilton from his post as corporate affairs minister, Labour sought to
exploit the government's discomfort by demanding full details of the charges
against him.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow trade and industry secretary, told Mr Major in a
letter: 'It is essential that MPs and the general public are told the whole
truth, and not just presented with a parody of open government.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, told a press conference:
'We are not going to let this go away. We are not going to be reassured
about any of this until all the information is out in the open.'
Adding to the government's discomfort, Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods,
said Mr Major's Commons statement - which amounted to a claim that he had
tried to blackmail the government - was based entirely on hearsay evidence.
Mrs Barbara Mills, director of public prosecutions, disclosed that a note
summarising a conversation between Mr Major and an alleged intermediary of
Mr Fayed on September 29 was not passed to her office until last Thursday.
That was the day on which The Guardian published allegations that Mr
Hamilton and Mr Tim Smith, the former Northern Ireland minister, accepted
payment from Mr Fayed for asking Commons questions. Mr Smith resigned on
Friday.
As Downing Street steadfastly refused to shed further light on the identity
of the unnamed intermediary or the charges against Mr Hamilton, further
details emerged from friends of the former minister.
They said he was confronted by Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, and Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, with an allegation that he had
failed to disclose a consultancy with Mobil Oil and a separate allegation
about his relationship with Plateau Mining.
Mr Ryder was also said to have produced an anonymous letter alleging that Mr
Hamilton had avoided paying taxes.
The friends said Mr Hamilton was 'dismayed' by the prime minister's
treatment of him, but was not planning a bitter Commons resignation speech.
He expects to return to the government after disproving all the allegations.
Some of the allegations appeared likely to be considered by the Commons
privileges committee, described by Downing Street as the proper forum for
investigation of Mr Hamilton now that he has left the government.
Labour MPs, who walked out of the committee after the Tory majority decided
to sit in secret, appeared willing to return if the committee decides to
hold at least some sessions in public.
However, negotiations have so far failed to produce a deal.

Earnings per income share emerged at 11.3p (10.29p). The proposed final
dividend is maintained at 2.65p, holding the total at 10.6p.

FT  26 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Prospect to pay Pounds 11.7m for Whessoe
piping side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prospect Industries, the engineering services company, has agreed to acquire
the piping systems division of Whessoe for Pounds 11.7m.
The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 83.2m new shares to
Whessoe at 14p apiece, which will be placed with institutional investors.
Prospect also plans to raise Pounds 1m towards the costs of the acquisition
and placing with the issue of 7.07m new ordinary shares at the same price.
Qualifying shareholders will be invited to apply for 69.4m shares on a
1-for-3 basis.
The piping systems division of Whessoe trades as Aiton in the UK and Connex
in the US, and is involved in the design and manufacture of pipeworks for
nuclear and fossil fuelled power generation plants. For the 10-month period
to July 31 it incurred an operating loss of Pounds 2.7m on turnover of
Pounds 22.7m.
According to Whessoe, this was the result of a lack of orders, an unsuitable
product mix and contractual delays. Prospect's directors attribute its poor
performance to relocation and management changes at Connex, and believe the
division is 'already recovering from these setbacks'.
The piping systems business has a large, under-used fabrication plant in
Derby.
Prospect intends to move its UK repair, maintenance and piping businesses
onto this site, and to integrate the management and purchasing of its new
acquisition with one of its operating companies, Dunn. Mr Philip Wilbraham,
chairman of Prospect, said it was a 'unique opportunity to expand its
marketplace from a reduced cost base'.

FT  26 OCT 94 / CBI finds evidence of growing price pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Manufacturers are enjoying a surge in exports but plan to increase prices in
the face of rising costs, according to the Confederation of British
Industry's latest quarterly survey of industrial trends.
The survey showed that more manufacturers were planning to increase domestic
prices in the next four months than at any time since January 1991.
The CBI survey also found that:
Business optimism increased over the quarter.
Investment intentions improved, with the number of companies planning to
invest in new plant and equipment reaching its highest level since April
1989.
Fewer jobs are being lost than at any time since October 1989.
While the signs of an export-led recovery and higher manufacturing
investment may be welcome to the government, the news of potential
inflationary pressures raised fears that further interest rate increases
might be announced this year.
The CBI's findings on price expectations were one of the factors cited by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the
Bank of England, when they increased base rates last month.
CBI surveys deduct the proportion of those expecting a factor to decline
from those expecting it to increase, and express the result as a percentage
balance.
The balance of companies expecting to raise prices in the next four months
was 20 per cent, up from 12 per cent in the last quarterly survey and 15 per
cent in the CBI's monthly trends report in September.
The survey showed that a balance of 9 per cent of companies increased
domestic prices in the past four months - the highest since early 1991.
The CBI said that the pattern of price rises was mixed, with some industries
still reporting declines. It added that manufacturers' expectations of
higher prices did not always translate into reality.
Mr Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, calculated on a
seasonally adjusted basis that the balance of companies expecting higher
prices was unchanged in October, from the 22 per cent recorded in September.
The CBI said that manufacturers' costs had been rising more strongly than
expected. The balance of those reporting higher costs increased from 3 per
cent in July to 19 per cent in October.
Signs of potential inflationary pressure were evident in the fall in the
proportion of companies working below capacity. At 51 per cent, down from 54
per cent in July, this is at its lowest since July 1990, and is below its
long-term average.
Companies may be responding to impending capacity constraints by increasing
their investment plans. The balance of companies planning to increase
investment in plant and machinery was 16 per cent, up from 6 per cent in
July.
Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said:
'The improvement in investment intentions is encouraging, but it will need
to be sustained for a long time if we are to narrow the investment gap with
our major competitors.'
Export orders increased at their fastest rate since April 1988, with a
balance of 17 per cent of companies reporting an increase. This trend is
expected to continue in the next four months, with the balance of companies
expecting higher export deliveries - 25 per cent - at its highest since this
question was first asked in 1977.
The survey was conducted between September 23 and October 12 and covered
1,064 companies in 50 industries.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: BCP earnings drop 9.7% at nine
months
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Comercial Portugues, Portugal's fifth-largest bank, yesterday reported
a 9.7 per cent drop in nine-month net income to Es13.2bn (Dollars 86.3m)
from Es14.6bn in the same period last year.
The bank attributed the slide to a sharp decrease in profits from trading
activities as a result of lower interest rates on bond and money markets.
In spite of a slowdown in credit and deposit growth in Portugal due to
recession, BCP's net assets grew 17.9 per cent to Es2,052bn compared with
the first nine months of 1993.
Total deposits rose 17.5 per cent to Es1,635bn but credit to customers grew
only 2.6 per cent to Es817bn.
Cash flow increased 3.9 per cent to Es45.9bn.
BCP's hostile bid for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of Banco Portugues
do Atlantico, Portugal's second-largest bank, was vetoed by the government
in September.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Tenneco to pay Dollars 113m for German car exhaust producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, is expected to announce
today that it will buy Gillet, a German automotive components manufacturer,
for cash and assumed debt in a deal valued at Dollars 113m.
The acquisition will boost Tenneco's European presence in the original
equipment sector of the components market and will give the company a
foothold in emerging markets where Gillet is already supplying customers.
The purchase marks a further expansion by US component manufacturers into
the European market, where several of Tenneco's competitors have already
identified growth opportunities.
Gillet, based in Edencoben, is Europe's largest maker of exhaust systems for
new cars. It supplies parts to all of Europe's main carmakers. With 2,000
employees at 14 plants, including three in the UK, Gillet had sales of
Dollars 275m last year.
Tenneco is expected to merge family-owned Gillet into its Walker
Manufacturing subsidiary, which produces exhaust systems as replacement
parts in the US and Europe. Walker had sales of about Dollars 900m in 1993,
including Dollars 219m from its European operations. Walker and Gillet
combined will give Tenneco a leading position in Europe's original and
replacement equipment markets.
The purchase will be the third in a series of acquisitions aimed at
bolstering Tenneco's three core businesses - natural gas, packaging and
automotive components. It agreed last month to buy a US power generating and
natural gas development company for Dollars 60m and said it would spend
Dollars 73m to upgrade a US containerboard plant.
Tenneco's investment in Gillet comes as it makes plans to shut its
86-year-old German tractor-making operation as part of a worldwide
retrenchment.
JI Case, Tenneco's heavy equipment subsidiary, will close its tractor
factory in Neuss some time after June 1996. The Neuss plant has 1,300
employees.
The company believes that the European auto components market offers more
potential for growth than farm equipment.
Securities analysts expect Tenneco to report third-quarter earnings of about
74 cents per share today, and to announce the Gillet acquisition.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Japanese cabinet prepares for opening of rice market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cabinet yesterday adopted a plan to spend Y6,010bn (Dollars 62bn) to
prepare rice farmers for the gradual opening of their market.
The package, prepared by the three parties of the ruling coalition, clears
the way for parliament to ratify the trade liberalisation bills needed to
comply with the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Japan aims to ratify the Gatt accord in the present parliamentary session,
ending on December 3. As part of the accord, a previous government agreed
last year to import 4-8 per cent of its annual 10m tonne rice consumption
over the next six years, and replace import quotas with tariffs some time
after that. The farm aid package will be spent over the same period.
The aid programme was criticised yesterday for failing to do enough to
encourage large efficient farms, at the expense of traditional small paddy
fields. The government is bargaining that the cash will at least compensate
farmers for the opening of the rice market.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Vietnam 'enters tougher phase': World Bank clears Dollars
150m loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vietnam's economic adjustment programme is entering a more demanding phase
now that relatively easy price reforms have been accomplished, the World
Bank said yesterday.
Announcing the approval of a Dollars 150m, 40-year structural adjustment
loan, its fourth to Vietnam since lending resumed last year, the bank
singled out restructuring of state banks, privatisation of public companies
and trade reform as still to be tackled.
Vietnam should also introduce further legal reform to provide a basic civil
and commercial law code and simplify investment rules to facilitate business
activity.
The reform programme had produced 'impressive results', especially since it
was begun without real outside financial help. But 'some weaknesses are
evident in the reform programme and in the economy'.
Vietnam remained a poor country with per capita income below Dollars 200 a
year and sharp regional disparities in living standards. Weak infrastructure
and an inefficient financial system hindered investment.
International donors could provide significant finance for development, but
the government would need effective institutions to take most advantage of
development assistance.
The financial sector was burdened by bad debts in state-owned commercial
banks, poor accounting and management practices, and high taxation. The
trade system should be reformed to abolish import permits and introduce a
simplified tariff structure.
This year Vietnam is committed to reducing its fiscal deficit to 2.7 per
cent of GDP from 6.2 per cent in 1993. It is expected to rise to 3.3 per
cent in 1995.

FT  26 OCT 94 / Insurer restricts business with Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Short-term export credit insurance for companies doing business in Saudi
Arabia is being restricted by a leading international insurer.
NCM Credit Insurance, the Dutch-controlled company which provides 80 per
cent of short-term export credit cover in the UK, told customers it was
taking the step because of the kingdom's 'very grave' financial situation
and payments delays.
Meanwhile, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, said yesterday that
Saudi Arabia was facing some 'credit problems', but added that the kingdom
did not have any serious financial difficulties.
Mr Bentsen, who visited Saudi Arabia earlier this month, said that the
government was taking steps to bring down the budget deficit.
NCM Credit Insurance told UK customers it was cancelling open account credit
limit approvals and would only reinstate them if strict criteria were met.
This means that cover to regular exporters will no longer be automatically
available.
The company added: 'We recognise the seriousness of these measures and their
likely impact on the business of many of our customers.
'However, the situation in Saudi is very grave and continues to deteriorate.
It is therefore vital that we take action to protect not only our own
position but, in the final analysis, that of our customers.'
International concern about Saudi Arabia's financial health has increased
since the 1991 Gulf war, which cost the kingdom about Dollars 60bn, and
because of the continuing weakness in the price of oil. In an effort to
answer International Monetary Fund concerns over the size of the budget
deficit, the Saudi government announced at the start of the year that it
would cut spending by 20 per cent.
A western diplomat in Riyadh conceded yesterday that many Saudi businessmen
were pessimistic about the short-term economic outlook, but stressed that
Saudi Arabia's ability to pump 8m barrels of oil a day for the next century
guaranteed its long-term economic viability.
NCM warned more than two months ago of its concern over lengthening payments
delays and said amounts outstanding were 'significant'. It added that the
payments delays were affecting all areas of the economy, and affecting Saudi
buyers' ability to meet commitments to overseas suppliers.
Since then, NCM said: 'The position has steadily deteriorated and the impact
on the market has become ever more apparent.'
It added: 'Repeated promises of payment from senior Saudi officials,
including promises made directly to UK trade ministers, have not been
fulfilled and there is no suggestion of an early improvement in the
situation.'

FT  26 OCT 94 / Markets fall as dollar hits new lows: US currency and bond
weakness blamed on Fed - European stocks suffer setbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar slipped to fresh lows against the D-Mark and the yen
yesterday, while European bond and equity markets fell in the wake of
Monday's rise in the US Treasury long bond yield above 8 per cent.
The US currency touched a post-second world war low of Y96.35 and a two-year
low of DM1.4845, before recovering to close in London at Y96.86 and DM1.492.
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, whose reported comments last
week hurt dollar sentiment by apparently ruling out intervention to support
the US currency, yesterday said: 'We would like a stronger dollar.'
Traders have blamed the recent weakness in the dollar and the US Treasury
bond market on the belief that the US Federal Reserve was acting too slowly
to combat inflation. Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical
Bank in London, said: 'Sentiment towards the dollar remains pretty
unanimously negative.'
But Mr Alan Blinder, the Fed deputy chairman, said he did not believe the
Fed was 'behind the curve' in fighting inflation. 'I think we're very close
to riding the curve,' he said, implying that the Fed's actions were up with
events.
However, Mr Blinder added that the economy was 'showing fewer signs of
deceleration than I would have thought several months ago.'
Financial markets gained a small amount of relief yesterday from figures on
US consumer confidence and employment costs, which appeared to show subdued
inflationary pressures.
Nevertheless, European markets reacted negatively to the rise in the US long
bond yield, with the 8 per cent level seen as a watershed for the markets.
'Previously 8 per cent was seen as fair value for Treasury bonds,' said Mr
Michael Hughes, global strategist at UK securities house BZW. 'But there is
a growing concern that markets are headed for an overshoot.' UK investment
bank Kleinwort Benson is predicting that the long bond yield will rise to
8.5 per cent.
German government bunds and UK gilts dropped about three quarters of a point
and bond fed through to shares.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 28.2 points down at 3,000.9, having at
one point fallen 43.5 points to 2,985.6.
A weak US dollar also hurts European shares by damaging prospects for
export-led growth and reducing the local currency value of the earnings of
US subsidiaries of European companies.
In Frankfurt, the DAX index closed 1.3 per cent lower in after-hours trading
yesterday while in Paris, the CAC-40 index closed just under 1 per cent
down.
In New York, the 30-year Treasury bond had slipped a further sixth of a
point by 2.30pm and was yielding 8.06 per cent, while the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was 21.2 points lower at 3,834.10.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Accor net loss reaches FFr264m
for first six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Accor, the French hotels and travel service group, yesterday announced that
it had incurred a net deficit of FFr264m (Dollars 49.9m) for the first half
of the year, compared with a net profit of FFr109m for the same period in
1993.
The company had warned last week that it would fall into the red, partly
because of a lack this year of exceptional gains, which boosted earnings in
the first half of 1993.
In addition to the losses, the company announced that it was planning a
series of asset disposals worth an estimated FFr2.5bn by the end of next
year.
The disposals are aimed at reducing the group's debt burden, which stood at
FFr13.3bn at the end of last year, excluding the borrowings and financial
commitments relating to Motel 6, the US chain controlled by Accor.
Accor, which previously held 39.5 per cent of Motel 6 through IBL, a holding
company, said it had decided to consolidate the chain to the level of 73.6
per cent in its accounts.
It said that the decision, prompted by the anticipation of the exercise of
put options by other investors in the chain, resulted in a negative charge
of FFr57m.
In spite of the loss, the first in its history, Accor said that its
operating results had recovered from a net deficit of FFr74m last year, on a
pro-forma basis, to FFr107m.
Industry analysts said that the recovery reflected the improved state of the
European hotels market following the recession of 1992 and 1993.
Accor said that the improved performance of its businesses, and the expected
exceptional gains on the disposal of assets, should allow a result for the
full year at least equal to the FFr615m achieved in 1993.

The Indian Supreme Court has cleared the way for Hindustan Lever, the Indian
affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch combine, to acquire Tata Oil Mills
Company (Tomco), a soaps and detergents manufacturer which is part of Tata,
India's largest industrial grouping.
The court rejected five petitions asking for special leave to challenge the
merger.
The main petitioner, Hindustan Lever Employees' Union, had taken the case to
the Supreme Court after the Bombay High Court dismissed its plea to block
the merger in May.
Employees' unions of both companies challenged the merger after workers
feared they would lose their jobs.

CSX reported its second consecutive quarter of record earnings yesterday, as
the US transportation company continued to reap the benefits of productivity
improvements, tight cost controls and a buoyant economic environment in its
main domestic and foreign markets.
Mr John Snow, chairman of the Virginia-based CSX, said he expected these
positive trends to sustain the company's earnings well into 1995.
In its third quarter, CSX earned Dollars 177m, or Dollars 1.68 a share, on
operating revenues of Dollars 2.47bn. In the same period a year ago, the
group earned (excluding tax-related charges) Dollars 117m, or Dollars 1.13,
on revenues of Dollars 2.24bn.
Operating income at the company's railway unit CSX Transportation jumped 40
per cent to Dollars 224m in the quarter, while income at its
container-shipping unit, Sea-Land Service, climbed 10 per cent to Dollars
78m.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: North Broken Hill takes Dominion
Mining stake

North Broken Hill Peko, the Australian mining and equipment group which has
been debt-free since selling its paper manufacturing and merchanting
operations last year, has acquired a 14.9 per cent interest in Dominion
Mining, a smaller Western Australian gold mining company.
The stake was purchased in two parts. A 4.95 per cent holding was built up
through market purchases 'over recent weeks'. A larger, 9.9 per cent
interest was then bought from Gold Mines of Australia, a small mining
company which earlier this year launched a bid for Dominion.
North acquired the latter stake at GMA's entry cost of ADollars 19.4m
(USDollars 14.2m), or about 45 cents per Dominion share.
GMA decided not to press ahead with its ADollars 182m bid for Dominion last
July, after the target company granted NBHP an option to take an 80 per cent
interest in Dominion's ADollars 500m Yakabindie nickel project in Western
Australia.

FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Conseco delays Kemper takeover
</HEADLINE>

Conseco, the US life insurance group, yesterday said it would not complete
its planned Dollars 2.7bn acquisition of Kemper this year, due to a delay in
lining up finance for the bid.
The news follows growing uncertainty in recent weeks about the financial
backing for the highly-leveraged transaction.
In spite of the delay, Conseco said its bid would go ahead, and that it was
still 'exploring' the sale of one or more of its life insurance company
holdings to reduce the debt portion of the deal.
'With or without asset sales, we remain confident that financing for the
acquisition of Kemper will be available on terms acceptable to Conseco,'
said Mr Stephen Hilbert, chairman.
If it does not sell assets, Conseco's high debt level after the acquisition
would almost certainly lead to a downgrade of its credit standing by the
rating agencies, adding to its borrowing costs.
The company has already received commitments from banks for Dollars 1.2bn of
debt to back the Kemper takeover. Under the terms of that loan, any cash
raised by the sale of the life company interests would be used to repay part
of the bank debt.
Conseco is also planning to begin selling Dollars 750m of junk bonds early
next month. This part of the fund-raising is backed by a letter from Morgan
Stanley, Conseco's adviser, which says it is 'highly confident' the money
can be raised. Although not legally a form of underwriting, the investment
bank's decision to stake its reputation on the success of the financing
implies a heavy commitment to the transaction.
The deal needs the approval of both companies' shareholders, regulators and
investors in Kemper's mutual funds. Conseco added that it would seek to
postpone a hearing by Illinois insurance regulators set for next Wednesday.
Kemper had third-quarter operating earnings of Dollars 32.7m on its
continuing operations, which before one-off factors were flat on last year.
