Human rights monitors returned to Haiti at the weekend in their first
mission since their expulsion by the former military government in July.
Thirteen observers and four administrative staff from the joint United
Nations and Organisation of American States mission arrived from
neighbouring Dominican Republic, the first contingent of a mission expected
to rise to around 300 monitors.
Haiti's greatly weakened army has said it will search the homes of people
suspected of having illegal arms beginning next week and warned suspects to
turn in their firearms or face arrest.

Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, has won an injunction
forcing a halt to shipments of clones of its microprocessors made by
Advanced Micro Devices, a rival US chip maker. The court order will not take
effect, however, until mid-January by which time AMD claims that it will be
ready to ship new versions of its microprocessors with the offending
software 'microcode' expunged. The injunction follows a ruling this month
that AMD microprocessors contain 'microcode' software that infringes an
Intel copyright. The case is the latest is a decade of legal battles between
the semiconductor industry rivals.
With its Intel-compatible microprocessors, AMD has gained about 6 per cent
of the market, while Intel supplies about 90 per cent of all microprocessors
used in personal computers. AMD's largest customer is Compaq Computer, the
PC market leader. Intel said it will seek damages for all shipments of AMD's
microprocessors that contain the infringing microcode. The court has yet to
rule on damages. The judge has, however, effectively given AMD a reprieve by
allowing the chip maker to meet orders for its microprocessor chips until
January 15.

<TEXT>
Argentina's economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, is today expected to ask
congress to approve an amendment to the 1994 budget providing for extra
spending of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn in order to meet pension
payments for the rest of the year. The request, the first retroactive budget
amendment since Mr Cavallo launched economic reforms in 1991, has added to
speculation that Argentina's fiscal position has deteriorated sharply in the
second half of the year as tax collection has fallen and spending climbed.
Mr Daniel Artana, an economist at the Foundation for Latin American Economic
Investigation, said that, although Argentina's public accounts remained
'fairly solid', the country was 'in a more fragile situation than it used to
be.' The worsening fiscal position threatened to derail further cuts in
payroll taxes planned for next year, part of efforts to sharpen Argentine
competitiveness, Mr Artana said.
Mr Cavallo said the additional funds, which would increase the 1994 federal
budget to about Dollars 41.5bn, were needed because of recent court
decisions granting higher pensions. The Peronist administration, which has
been trying to stop pension indexation in an effort to trim spending, says
the court rulings set a precedent which could cost the treasury up to
Dollars 300m extra a month.
Mr Cavallo is also expected to seek legislation that would curb the ability
of judges to increase pensions for thousands of other retired people seeking
legal redress. However, efforts to save money will be weighed against the
danger of losing electoral support, given that presidential elections are
less than seven months away.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Civil servants' vote ousted Astra chief: How satellite TV
pioneer Pierre Meyrat lost a boardroom battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The search begins in earnest this week for a new director general of Societe
Europeenne des Satellites, the organisation that operates the Astra
satellite system, after last week's unceremonious ousting of Dr Pierre
Meyrat.
Dr Meyrat was removed after a tense boardroom battle on Thursday lasting
more than four hours and 'released from his duties', even though he had the
support of the main users and would-be users of the Astra system such as
British Sky Broadcasting, Mr Leo Kirch, the German broadcasting entrepreneur
and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom.
The departure of one of the pioneers of European satellite television and
director general of SES for the past nine years will upset many of the
company's main customers, increase uncertainty about the imminent move to
digital satellite television and put large question marks over SES's plan to
float on the London Stock Exchange and the other major exchanges of Europe
possibly as early as next year.
Dr Meyrat is the first to admit he is no diplomat. As an executive from an
entrepreneurial background in the Swiss cable television industry he placed
more emphasis on getting decisions taken and plans implemented than
discussing details with the 24-strong board.
The board includes a large number of representatives of German and
Luxembourg financial institutions and eight Luxembourg civil servants. 'He
is dogged, determined and Swiss and sometimes difficult to work with,' said
one SES director yesterday. It is equally obvious that he has presided over
one of the most successful satellite television operations in the world.
SES already broadcasts 48 channels of television across Europe from three
satellites with a fourth 16-channel satellite due up in the next few weeks.
A fifth and sixth satellite, which could be devoted to the provision of a
150-channel digital television service for Europe, are due to be launched in
1995 and 1996.
There have been several previous attempts to remove Dr Meyrat but the most
determined came in July from a group of directors and shareholders including
the two SES vice-chairmen Mr Romain Bausch, chairman of the SNCI bank of
Luxembourg, and Count Roland Kergorlay, a private SES investor. When news of
the coup attempt leaked letters arrived in support of Dr Meyrat from most of
the main SES users.
Mr Frank Barlow, chairman of BSkyB, and also managing director of Pearson,
owners of the Financial Times, sent an unambiguous appeal that Dr Meyrat,
aged 57, should stay for the next 12-24 months until a suitable successor
could be found. The issue was never put to the vote at the July board
meeting and it appeared the director general had received overwhelming board
support.
The chairman, Mr Pierre Werner, even wrote to one worried Astra user
reassuring him that Dr Meyrat had the confidence of the board and would
continue to chair the management committee of the organisation until a
successor was identified in 'a measured time frame'.
Since then support seems to have ebbed away from Dr Meyrat, not because of
anything he has done since July, but because the splits within the
organisation were so deep that the decision-making process was being
disrupted and progress delayed. It appears that the three executive
directors who will now run the management committee - Mr Celso Azevedo, the
technical director who will be acting chairman of the committee, Mr Yves
Elsen, secretary general, and Mr Jurgen Schulte, the director of finance -
reluctantly came to the view that change would have to be speeded up to end
paralysis.
But it was the votes of the eight Luxembourg civil servants on the board
which was crucial. To remove the director-general a two-thirds majority was
needed. At the meeting which was attended throughout by Dr Meyrat he was
supported by an Anglo-German alliance of Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, which
earlier this year spent around Pounds 80m to buy a 16.6 per cent stake in
SES, Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Thames Television, a Pearson
subsidiary. There was a large majority against Meyrat but it was the votes
of the eight Luxembourg civil servants who all voted against him that
created the two-thirds majority for removal.
Dr Meyrat has told friends that he is astonished by the outcome which he
ascribes to the plotting of individuals who did not like him. He has also
stressed he has never formally been accused of anything.
'It's a spectacular free kick for the opposition. It also shows that who
runs SES is determined by Luxembourg civil servants,' a very angry SES user
said yesterday.
The row, and what it says about the way SES is run, will provide a
considerable boost to Eutelsat, the Paris-based rival European satellite
organisation. All main Astra users are believed to be talking to Eutelsat
about the future, and the introduction of digital television in a much more
serious way than ever before.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
   Bratislava
A dismally low turnout has invalidated a referendum in Slovakia aimed at
fighting corruption in privatisation of state property. Only 19.96 per cent
of Slovakia's 3.8m registered voters cast ballots in Saturday's referendum,
far below the 51 per cent turnout required for a valid vote. The referendum
was demanded by left-wing parties to stiffen laws on purchase of state
property. The initiative was meant to answer suspicions that illegally
obtained funds have been used in the purchase of state property since
communism fell in 1989.
One of the referendum's staunchest supporters, ex-premier Vladimir Meciar,
said he wanted the referendum to trigger a law that would open
investigations of past purchases of state-owned property. Critics of the
referendum said it was simply a ploy by some left-wing parties, including Mr
Meciar's party, to whip up popular support during the recent election
campaign.

No clear majority emerged yesterday in regional elections in Spain's Basque
region where Madrid-based parties made strong gains at the expense of local
nationalist parties. With 99 per cent of votes counted the governing Basque
Nationalist party (PNV), the mainstream nationalist party, had equalled its
former standing by taking 22 seats. However the Basque Socialist party
(PSE), its junior coalition partner in the Basque government, fell from 16
seats to 12, and it appeared their combined total of seats would fall short
of an overall majority in the 75-member Basque parliament.
Underlining a shift away from narrow-based nationalist politics, Herri
Batasuna, the radical Basque coalition which supports the ETA separatist
group, also lost support, taking 11 seats against 13 in the 1990 elections.
The conservative Popular Party (PP) Spain's main opposition party, increased
its six seats in the outgoing to Basque legislature to 11, and the Communist
party-led Izquierda Unida, IU, which had no representatives in the outgoing
parliament was expected to return six members. Officials said 60 per cent of
the 1.7m eligible voters went to the polls.

<TEXT>
The UN and Bosnia's Moslem-led government failed yesterday to forge a
security agreement for Sarajevo's key supply route, throwing into doubt a
Bosnian troop withdrawal from a violated demilitarised zone. At a meeting in
the Bosnian capital military negotiators agreed only to talk again today.
The Bosnian government has demanded the UN provide security for a road that
snakes down Mt Igman, west of Sarajevo, in full view of Bosnian Serb guns.
The road has come under fire from Bosnian Serb troops for months. Some
shooting has been from artillery even though a Security Council resolution,
backed by a threat of Nato air strikes, bans big guns from the area.
Resolution of this issue could determine how fast, or even whether Bosnian
government troops withdraw from a demilitarised zone behind Mt Igman.
The Bosnian government gave a commitment at the weekend to begin withdrawing
troops from the demilitarised zone at midday today and to complete the
process as quickly as possible, UN officials said. The security meeting
yesterday followed the apparent success of UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi
in persuading Serbs to lift from today a fuel blockade that has brought UN
operations in eastern Bosnian Moslem enclaves to a standstill.

<TEXT>
Industrial action by Italian airline pilots, customs officials, air traffic
controllers, technicians, and ground and cabin staff threatens to disrupt
arrivals and departures at Italian airports this week, particularly today,
tomorrow and on Wednesday.
The protests are not co-ordinated and have been called for various reasons.
Under emergency rules, certain flights are guaranteed, including many
intercontinental flights arriving in Italy. Alitalia has specifically warned
of flight cancellations and delays between 10am and 6pm on Wednesday because
of a strike by cabin staff and air traffic controllers.
Some workers are protesting against the Italian government's budget plans,
some against new contract proposals, and others against the planned merger
between Alitalia and its domestic subsidiary, Ati. Last Friday, eight out of
10 Ati pilots reported sick, forcing cancellation of 113 mainly domestic
flights. The pilots, most of whom were back at work by yesterday, object to
the Alitalia-Ati merger, which they claim will hinder promotion. They plan
an official strike on Friday.

<TEXT>
Mr Gianfranco Fini, leader of the MSI/National Alliance, Italy's
extreme-right political grouping, yesterday promised hardline neo-fascists
in the MSI that a full merger with the National Alliance would open a
'wonderful new phase' in the party's history. At a meeting of MSI leaders on
Saturday, Mr Fini confirmed plans to absorb the old party, founded after the
war by followers of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, into the
'post-fascist' Alliance, which has been part of Italy's governing coalition
since the March elections. The proposal, broached last month, will be put to
MSI members at a party congress to begin on January 25.
Though Mr Fini's speech drew angry reactions from hardline MSI members, it
got broad support from most of his audience. Mr Fini reinforced his message
yesterday by urging MSI members not to ally themselves with the hard left in
Italian politics against the government. 'The MSI was the political
instrument of the alternative right wing; the National Alliance is the
instrument of the right wing in government,' he said.
In public relations terms, a merger would be the most important step yet
taken by Mr Fini to distance the Alliance from its neo-fascist roots and to
mollify hostile public opinion outside Italy. Last week, TV pictures were
broadcast round the world of MSI/National Alliance deputies taking part in a
brawl with opponents in Italy's lower house of parliament.

FT  24 OCT 94 / EU's new leader faces baptism of fire: Jacques Santer is
caught in a battle between two foreign policy barons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jacques Santer, president-designate of the European Commission, will this
week seek to resolve an acrimonious dispute over the share-out of new
portfolios, the first test of his grip on colleagues and clout with member
states.
But a power struggle between the Commission's two foreign policy barons  -
Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, and Mr Hans Van den Broek, the
Dutch commissioner in charge of political affairs - threatens to sink Mr
Santer's hopes of reaching an early agreement.
Other last minute hitches include the Italian government's delay in
nominating its two commissioners, uncertainty over control of the
agriculture portfolio, and the absence of a political heavyweight willing to
take charge of the single market.
Mr Santer remains determined to reach agreement at a meeting with his new
commissioners in Luxembourg on Saturday, despite hints from Sir Leon's camp
that the senior British commissioner may block a deal if he is asked to cede
responsibility for relations with central and eastern Europe to Mr Van den
Broek.
Mr Van den Broek has also failed to endear himself to Mr Santer by objecting
to the Commission president's plan to assume personal control over foreign
policy in the new Commission. Mr Santer intends to introduce new committees
of commissioners in order to co-ordinate policy-making better.
Officials close to Mr Santer portray the plan as a bid to break up personal
fiefdoms which have flourished at the end of the 10-year reign of Mr Jacques
Delors, the outgoing president.
Mr Santer also wants to inject greater realism about the role of the
Commission in foreign affairs, especially since sovereignty-conscious member
states led by France, the UK and Spain have made clear they do not want
Brussels usurping their own powers under the guise of the Maastricht treaty.
As part of this effort, he wants to break down the barriers between
political and economic affairs in the present Commission whose curtailed
two-year tenure ends on January 6. This division, introduced by Mr Delors in
1992 to exploit the sharper profile given the Commission by the Maastricht
treaty, is widely viewed as a mistake and has led to constant turf battles
between officials loyal to Sir Leon and Mr Van den Broek.
Instead, Mr Santer would like to engineer a split on geographic lines. He
has suggested tentatively that Mr Manuel Marin, senior Spanish commissioner,
would retain control over Latin America and the Mediterranean; Mr Joao de
Deus Pinheiro, former Portuguese foreign minister, would look after the
developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific; Sir Leon
would handle trade relations with the developed countries.
Mr Van den Broek would continue to be responsible for orthodox diplomacy
such as attending international conferences, but he would also take over
relations with central and eastern Europe - a plum job since one of the
chief tasks of the new five-year Santer Commission will be to lay the
groundwork for EU membership of Poland, the Czech republic, and Hungary.
Mr Van den Broek may emerge with enhanced powers thanks to Mr Santer's
desire to bolster the Christian Democrat influence in a Commission likely to
be dominated by socialists.
Other posts tentatively agreed in the new Commission include transport for
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former UK Labour party leader; environment for Ms Ritt
Bjerregard, the new Danish commissioner; and research and competitiveness
for Madame Edith Cresson, the former French prime minister. Mr Martin
Bangemann, the senior German industry commissioner, will retain control over
information technology, while Mr Karel van Miert, will continue running
competition policy but drop control of personnel. Mr Santer also plans to
pencil in jobs for commissioners from Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway,
which are due to join the EU next year, pending referendums in the latter
two countries in the next few weeks. Austria and Finland have already voted
to join. Each country would be able to nominate one commissioner.
An unresolved question concerns the future of Prof Mario Monti, the
distinguished Italian economics professor who is the first choice of the
Berlusconi government, but who wants responsibility for the economics
directorate, including preparation for monetary union.
The trouble is that the French government has waged an apparently successful
campaign for the Emu job on behalf of Mr Yves-Thibault de Silguy, former
adviser to Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister.
Last week, efforts were being made to persuade Prof Monti to come to
Brussels to run the economics directorate without Emu but with new
responsibilities, possibly including supervision of the multi-billion Ecus
'cohesion' funds which funnel money to the 'poor four' - Greece, Ireland,
Portugal and Spain - in order to help them prepare for Emu.

FT  24 OCT 94 / FDP poll result strains Kohl's coalition talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will today open negotiations to form another
coalition government amid signs that the talks are not likely to be as quick
and easy as he hopes.
The Free Democratic party (FDP), the small liberal party which has been in
coalition with Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 1982, is
likely to be a difficult negotiation partner following internal wrangling
after the party's second worst election result since 1949.
The party leadership was meeting last night to map out a strategy for the
talks. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, a former economics minister and chairman of the
party's largest state branch, has come out in open opposition to Mr Klaus
Kinkel, the party leader and foreign minister.
While the indications were last night that Mr Kinkel would see off
opposition from Mr Mollemann, differences remain over negotiating strategy.
The CDU has said it wants quick coalition negotiations which would clear the
way for Mr Kohl's re-election as chancellor in mid-November, an election
where the government coalition will need every vote it can muster to
preserve its 10-seat majority.
Parliament will meet for its opening session in Berlin on November 10, and
the so-called 'chancellor vote' is scheduled for November 17.
The FDP has said it wants 'binding' commitments on the policies of the
future coalition government. A party spokeswoman would not spell out the
party's demands ahead of the negotiations, but the FDP is likely to push for
tax cuts, an end to government subsidies, and for measures to integrate
Germany's 6.5m foreigners.
The party is also likely to resist pressure to give up any of the five
ministries it controls in the 18-seat cabinet. The Christian Social Union
(CSU), the CDU's more conservative Bavarian sister party, has overtaken the
FDP to become the second strongest party in the three-party coalition and
has indicated that it will want the appropriate reward.
There are likely to be few changes at the most important ministries. Mr
Kinkel is expected to stay as foreign minister, Mr Theo Waigel as finance
minister and Mr Volker Ruhe as defence minister.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the opposition Social Democratic party
(SPD), has said he will not stand against Mr Kohl in the 'chancellor vote'.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Tough test of stamina for Macedonia's president: Re-elected
leader must maintain momentum of reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President Kiro Gligorov, 77, re-elected last week by a wide margin in
Macedonia's first direct presidential vote, made a point of campaigning as
energetically as politicians half his age.
He will need both stamina and flexibility to persuade Greece to lift its
eight-month trade blockade against Macedonia, and to push through
free-market and social reforms at a faster rate.
Mr Gligorov, an economist with an up-and-down career in the former Yugoslav
communist party, came out of retirement to advise the reform-minded Markovic
government at the end of the 1980s. He was therefore well-placed to rally
Macedonia's inexperienced young politicians as the transition started to
independence and a market economy.
His first achievement as president, elected by a parliament dominated by the
hardline nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Movement (VMRO), was
to negotiate the withdrawal of ex-Yugoslav forces based in Macedonia early
in 1992, taking with them aircraft and heavy weapons.
Then came the task of persuading the international community that Macedonia,
the poorest and least-developed republic in the former Yugoslavia, could
become viable.
While Macedonia's chances of survival now seem brighter, Mr Gligorov will
still have to make some concessions to transform its uncertain international
status under the temporary name of Fyrom (former Yugoslav republic of
Macedonia) into permanent recognition.
However, his election triumph, capturing about 77 per cent of votes cast,
should give some room for manoeuvre in re-opening UN-sponsored talks with
Greece, which asserts that Macedonia's name amounts to a claim on its own
province of Macedonia.
Despite confused and incomplete first-round returns in last week's
parliamentary vote - held simultaneously with the presidential poll - it is
clear that support for VMRO has dropped sharply.
The Alliance for Macedonia, a coalition led by ex-communists and backed by
Mr Gligorov, will almost certainly emerge from the October 30 run-off poll
as the largest party in parliament.
The mood in Athens is now more conciliatory, with Greek officials again
talking of North, or New, Macedonia as a possible compromise on the name
issue. Mr Gligorov, until now reluctant to accept any change in the name,
will come under pressure to accept.
Mr Gligorov's other priority will be to speed up the transition to a
free-market economy by promoting privatisation and banking reform more
effectively.
Macedonia's state-owned banks are technically insolvent, burdened with huge
debts accumulated by large industrial concerns and by more than Dollars 1bn
in foreign currency liabilities.
A stabilisation plan launched in agreement with the International Monetary
Fund is starting to produce results, with annual inflation projected to drop
to 55 per cent this year, against 250 per cent in 1993. But if recovery is
to follow, President Gligorov must encourage the new government to launch
structural reforms without delay.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Confrontation looming for Scharping over PDS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opposition Social Democratic party (SPD) may be heading for another
confrontation over the vexed question of co-operation with the former East
German communists, now called the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS).
The national party leadership rejected comments by Mr Harald Ringstorff, the
SPD leader in the north-eastern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, that
he had been given permission to talk with the PDS.
'We don't know where Ringstorff has got this idea from,' said an SPD
spokeswoman in Bonn.
The looming showdown will be a key test for Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD
national leader who has repeatedly said that his party will not work with
the PDS, which many of Germany's established parties have called
'undemocratic'.
Mr Ringstorff has been pushing for talks with the PDS even though many SPD
party members in Mecklenburg favoured a grand coalition with the Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party.
However, there are signs that the mood in the Mecklenburg SPD may be
changing after the 29-strong party council endorsed further talks with the
PDS at a special meeting on Saturday.
The SPD in Mecklenburg may seek to copy the sort of co-operation which
exists between the party and the PDS in the neighbouring state of
Saxony-Anhalt, where in June the PDS for the first time had a hand in the
shaping of a state government.
There is no formal coalition between the parties, but the PDS has so far
'tolerated' a minority government run by the SPD and the Greens. The fact
that the SPD might be working alone with the PDS in Mecklenburg has made its
position all the more controversial.
However, it remains difficult to see how Mr Ringstorff will be able to pull
off any sort of co-operation with the PDS.
In the central state of Thuringia, the CDU and the SPD have said they will
today begin coalition talks even though the result of last Sunday's election
was exactly the same as in Mecklenburg: the CDU as biggest party alongside
the SPD and the PDS.
SPD party headquarters in Bonn suggested Mr Ringstorff's talk of
co-operation with the PDS was designed to strengthen his hand when it came
to eventual negotiations with the CDU.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Dublin must revise claim to Ulster, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JOHN MURRAY-BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, will tell his Irish counterpart Mr
Albert Reynolds today that hopes for an overall political settlement in
Northern Ireland depend on a radical revision of Dublin's constitutional
claim to the province.
But ahead of their planned talks at Chequers, there were signs of Irish
irritation at a move by Mr Major to separate plans for an Ulster assembly
from wider talks on the province's status.
The meeting will follow British denial of a claim by Mr Martin McGuinness, a
leading official of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about private
assurances by the British government.
Mr McGuinness said on BBC television that during secret contacts last year,
a British civil servant had said London was working towards a united
Ireland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the claim
was 'nonsense'.
Mr Major hopes to persuade Mr Reynolds that the territorial claim to Ulster
in Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution is the main obstacle to an
agreed approach. Dublin has agreed to modify the claim, but the British side
will argue that unless Mr Reynolds goes further, moderate unionists in
Northern Ireland will reject a proposed framework document for talks on the
province's future.
The Irish prime minister, meanwhile, is concerned that Mr Major appears to
have weakened Britain's commitment to the comprehensive 'three-stranded'
approach to negotiations.
Mr Major said last week that proposals for strand one - the creation of an
assembly - were separate from the Anglo-Irish framework document, which
would cover strands two and three. Those concern relations between north and
south and between London and Dublin.
Mr Reynolds spelt out his demands yesterday that the proposed cross-border
institutions in strand two of the process must be given 'executive
functions'. He said: 'Such institutions also must address some of the key
interests common to north and south on a pragmatic basis.'
Irish officials said Mr Reynolds wanted today's meeting to 'pick up the
pace'. He was anxious to harness Sinn Fein to the political process quickly
to bolster Republican moderates. Dublin will also press for flexibility on
the issue of the surrender of IRA arms. Mr Reynolds repeated his view that
the question 'had to be confronted and dealt with but is not a precondition
for talks'.
In a move underlying Irish concerns, police in the republic detained several
people over the weekend in a four-county operation against 'elements of Sinn
Fein-IRA who may try to destabilise the peace process'.
One Irish newspaper yesterday said the IRA would review its ceasefire
decision in the spring. Mr McGuinness warned: 'If the central issues at the
heart of this conflict are not addressed or resolved, there will continue to
be conflict.'

FT  24 OCT 94 / Coutts extends private banking services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coutts &amp; Co, the 302-year-old private bank, is to move upmarket in the UK to
become what its new chief executive calls 'a proper private bank'.
Mr David Went, who took over at Coutts four months ago, believes that by the
turn of the century the bank may require customers to have at least Pounds
500,000 - at today's prices - in assets the bank can manage for them.
Coutts, wholly owned by National Westminster Bank, believes that because of
the expected growth in private wealth this decade it can double the number
of UK clients from the present 25,000 by becoming more exclusive.
'The traditional image of Coutts in the UK has been of a posh retail bank,
but it will become a proper private bank,' Mr Went said. That would mean
focusing on asset management for wealthy individuals rather than retail
banking.
Mr Went said Coutts, which at present seeks customers with Pounds 150,000 in
investable assets, would tighten its criteria. It would require at least
Pounds 300,000 by the end of the decade, and he 'would be surprised' if the
minimum was not Pounds 500,000.
Coutts is also trying to expand overseas because the demand for private
banking is expected to grow rapidly in the next decade. More individuals
will inherit wealth, and many entrepreneurs in Latin America and Asia are
becoming millionaires.
The bank already operates in 14 countries outside the UK, and will announce
shortly that it is opening three offices on the west coast of the US,
including one in Beverly Hills in Los Angeles and another in San Diego in
southern California.
Mr Went said Coutts would not 'sling out' customers who did not meet its
tighter criteria, but it might encourage some to transfer to NatWest
accounts for high-income customers that offer a more personal service than
the average account.
He said the bank might also try to persuade customers who have a current
account and a credit card to use it as an investment manager.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Single currency should be delayed, says EU bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Union should consider fixing the exchange rates of its
currencies irrevocably, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European
Monetary Institute, says.
But the head of the precursor of a European central bank believes there
should be a delay before introducing a single European currency in the third
and final stage of the EU's planned move to economic and monetary union.
Until now, the presumption has been that the Ecu would be introduced rapidly
as a single European currency once exchange rates were locked. But Mr
Lamfalussy said in an interview that a phased introduction of stage three
would ease many potential technical difficulties surrounding Emu, such as
agreement on common European banknotes.
'The threshold of stage three of Emu is the locking of the exchange rates,'
he explained. 'You cannot do that halfway. That means a European central
bank, one monetary policy, and harmonised interest rates on wholesale money
markets.'
Other things could be 'left open', he said. 'There need not be a swapping of
domestic banknotes for notes denominated in European currency units (Ecus).
I could imagine that taking place months or years after locking the European
exchange rates.'
Mr Lamfalussy conceded there would be some drawbacks in locking exchange
rates without then moving to a single currency with its own banknotes. But a
phased introduction of the final stage of Emu would have advantages.
Companies would have the benefit of locked exchange rates without having to
wait for the EU to overcome the technical difficulties of the banknote
change.
The idea had political attractions because people would have time to adjust
to a single currency rather than having Ecus thrust upon them. Also Europe's
commercial banks, which have expressed concern at delays in tackling the
practical aspects of Emu, would be reassured.
Mr Lamfalussy said the process of adaptation would be fostered if the
individual EU currencies were made legal tender in all the countries of the
union in the early stages of a phased introduction of a single currency.
He said the phased approach to stage three was not specifically his idea,
but was being discussed among officials preparing for Emu and was compatible
with the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Lamfalussy said that his institute, which has been in temporary premises
in Basle, Switzerland, would begin work in its new headquarters in
Frankfurt, Germany, next month. The EMI would then concentrate on fostering
co-operation among EU central banks and preparing the planned European
central bank so it could begin operating once political agreement has been
reached to complete Emu.
While Mr Lamfalussy said the prospects for Emu had improved over the past
year, he did not expect stage three to begin as soon as 1997, the earliest
date envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty.
Instead, he said he believed that there would be stage three and a European
central bank 'in five, six or 10 years' time'.

FT  24 OCT 94 / Hamilton under growing pressure to step down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The political career of Mr Neil Hamilton, one of the ministers at the heart
of recent allegations of financial impropriety, was hanging by a thread last
night after a senior cabinet minister appeared publicly to distance himself
from him.
The move - by Mr David Hunt, public services minister - came after two
former Conservative ministers, Mr Alan Clark and Mrs Edwina Currie,
indicated that the corporate affairs minister should step down from his post
while he clears his name.
Senior Conservative MPs suggested last night that Mr Hamilton, who has
vehemently denied charges of wrongdoing, should fight to prove his innocence
from the backbenches.
Mr Hamilton was named last week by Mr Mohamed Fayed, the Egyptian financier,
as one of two ministers who, Mr Fayed alleged, had received payments for
asking parliamentary questions.
Mr Hamilton is also alleged to have had an all-expenses paid stay at the
Ritz hotel in Paris. This may be the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. Mr
Fayed owns both the Ritz and Harrods, the London department store.
Meanwhile, the Home Office last night responded to separate reports
suggesting that Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, intervened directly
to help an application from Mr Ali Fayed, brother of Mohamed, for British
citizenship, by denying he had received special treatment.
'The home secretary was concerned at all times to see that the procedures
followed by the department were fair to Mr al-Fayed,' the Home Office said.
Labour said Mr Jack Straw, shadow home secretary, would be pressing for a
Commons statement by Mr Howard.
Commenting on ministerial standards in the wake of allegations about Mr
Hamilton's alleged hotel stay, Mr Hunt said: 'My view is that ministers and
members of parliament must never allow themselves to get into any position
where anyone outside could level an accusation against them that they
weren't adhering to the highest possible standards in public life.'
Mr Clark, a former trade minister, said the prime minister could 'quite
legitimately' say to Mr Hamilton that 'appearances make it impossible for
you to remain in your job for the time being'.
Mrs Edwina Currie, former health minister, said: 'A lot of us would feel
more comfortable if we could support Neil from the backbenches and not find
his work in government is being damaged.'
Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for Montgomery, sent a letter to Mr
John Major last night referring to an injunction obtained by 'a senior
Minister' against the Financial Times.
Mr Carlile asked for confirmation that such proceedings were regarded as
private actions between those concerned and the press 'and that the
government neither has paid nor will underwrite or pay the costs of any such
private proceedings.'

FT  22 OCT 94 / Arts: Burt Lancaster: good guy - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Burt Lancaster, who died in Los Angeles yesterday at the age of 80, was one
of the most varied and skillful male leads Hollywood has ever produced.
His ruggedly-handsome face and chiselled physique allowed him to achieve
stardom in the beefed-up, superficial American cinema of the 1950s, a time
when pectorals seemed more in demand than talent. But though Lancaster was
certainly never lacking in the muscle department, he did manage to pack
nearly every performance with emotional depth and great intelligence. It was
this skill that eventually allowed him to work well into his eighth decade,
long past the time that most of his contemporaries had been put out to stud.
Born the son of a postal clerk in 1913, Burton Stephen Lancaster grew up on
the mean streets of Harlem, using his prodigious physical skills to earn a
sports scholarship at university and then to win a job on a vaudeville
acrobatic team. Never truly successful on the hard-knocks variety circuit,
Lancaster worked at various menial jobs to make ends meet, and when the
second world war came along he was only too eager to give up acrobatics for
a stint as a special forces operative in the US army. Upon returning to
civilian life he took up screen acting, striking gold with an astonishing
debut performance as Swede in the 1946 noir classic, The Killers. After
years of nervy little tough guys like Bogart and Cagney, the war-weary
public seemed ready for this calmly regal star.
Although the next few years saw several 'heavy' roles in forgettable B-films
such as Brute Force and Kiss the Blood off my Hands, Lancaster soon
abandoned macho-heroics for more varied parts. Most memorable of these were
his work as a creepy, incestuous gossip columnist in Sweet Smell of Success
(1957) and the lovelorn sergeant warden in From Here to Eternity (1953).
This latter film raised Lancaster to icon status for his steamy beach
grapple with Deborah Kerr.
During this period, Lancaster also had the wisdom to opt out of the studio
grind, forming his own production company with agent Henry Hecht. In this
capacity he was to produce several notable films, including the
academy-award winning Marty (1955).
Lancaster won his sole acting Oscar in 1960 for his powerful portrayal of a
conman evangelist in Elmer Gantry, a film which completed his transition
from celluloid hunk to thinking actor. Subsequent performances in Judgment
at Nuremberg (1961) and Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) established him as the
premier male lead of the early 1960s, an actor who could satisfy the
public's desire for rugged good looks while at the same time pleasing the
critics. Lancaster's most mature performance came when he took on the
challenge of portraying the wistful Sicilian prince in Visconti's The
Leopard (1963). Several commentators had ranked this as one of the greatest
acting turns of all time.
The next 10 years were perhaps more notable for the roles Lancaster turned
down than for those he accepted. He rejected the lead in Patten to earn his
rent in Airport, a film he publicly judged to be 'junk'. Even more
amazingly, he also refused to be considered for the title role in The
Godfather. For the first time in his career, Lancaster had lost his nose for
the right move. Like his contemporaries Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis, he
seemed destined to become another wrinkling superstar condemned to cameo
hell. Remarkably, however, he managed to stage a comeback as he approached
his 70th year with his deeply-felt portrayal of an ageing Mafia hood in
Louis Malle's Atlantic City (1980). Three years later he was to score again
as the melancholy oil billionaire in Bill Forsythe's magical Local Hero.
Indeed, Lancaster's performance in Field of Dreams (1989) as an aged
baseball player who gets another chance to play served as a fitting coda for
an actor who was able to keep on having his turns at the plate.
One of the hallmarks of Lancaster's professionalism and generosity as an
actor was his unrivalled record of providing co-stars with Oscars, from
Shirley Booth to Anna Magnani, from Frank Sinatra to David Niven.
His own four nominations spanned 30 years, from From Here to Eternity to
Atlantic City - the fact that he lost out for that latter film to a feeble
Henry Fonda can be put down to Hollywood's indulgence for maudlin sentiment.
Not that it matters. While most actors would be happy to seem ageless as
they hit the twilight years, it was Burt Lancaster's special grace always to
seem full of the ages.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Arts: Young writers show dramatic talent - The world is
likely to hear more of these budding playwrights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The showcase season of this year's 21st Royal Court/Marks &amp; Spencer Young
Writers' Festival consists for the first time of two alternating double
bills rather than a single clutch of plays.
The writers, aged between 15 and 22, all display a heartening degree of
promise and one of the works on show is a little gem in its own right.
Corner Boys by 16-year-old Derry lad Kevin Coyle is a sometimes acute
teenage-view of teenagers. Although set in Derry, it is concerned less with
a particular city than a particular generation, the nothing-in-particular
youngsters whose late spokesman Kurt Cobain adorns the T-shirt of one of the
characters.
The series of vignettes draws much laughter of recognition as Dave and Barry
awkwardly work up to asking Angela and Kerry out for a big date at a cafe or
down at Kentucky Fried Chicken - and also as they try in vain to deal with
the neighbourhood psycho, Chopper. When Coyle occasionally tries to be flash
or profound his script rattles, but when the piece sticks closer to home it
maintains a satisfactory chunkiness.
Essex Girls by Rebecca Prichard is a fairly blatant comic-tragic contrast.
In the first act, a trio of would-be suss babes hang out, smoke and talk sex
in the girls' toilets of a comprehensive school. In the second, depressive
Kim - effectively abandoned by the drunkard father of her son - is visited
in her high-rise by her best friend, who tries desperately to snap her out
of her lassitude for even a short while.
The latter scene goes beyond simply subverting the considerable humour of
what has gone before, and gives the play the air of an exercise in
technique. Nevertheless, Prichard will certainly learn to structure her
dramas less obtrusively (this is her first play) and already has a
sensitivity for character and a keen ear for dialogue.
Roxana Silbert's direction is alert to the moods of the plays, and creates
an evening of solidity rather than sensation. The most impressive
performance on the bill is that of Siobhan Hayes as Kim in Essex Girls, who
capably conveys her character's mood of grey rather than black depression.
Co-director Jane Collins has the better deal in terms of material.
Fifteen-year-old Hayley Daniel's Looking for Home kicks off the second bill,
portraying the arguments of a divorced mother and her 13-year-old daughter
with an often uncomfortable rawness. Sam and her mother both say exactly
what they feel, partly because theirs is not a relationship that observes
polite conventions and partly because Daniel has yet to acquire the skill of
coating her characters with such a veneer.
Yet the glimpses into Sam's childish fantasies, and the fact that they
complement rather than supplant her grip on reality, are affecting, and
Sarah-Jane Potts is quite remarkable in her professional stage debut in the
role.
The jewel in the festival's crown, though, is The Knocky by Michael Wynne,
aged 21. The Kelly family celebrate their grandmother's 70th birthday on a
Birkenhead estate amid a culture of long-term unemployment and constant
theft - as the story begins, son Joseph himself knocks off the family video,
later joking that hot VCRs are virtually an alternative currency. The play
is an impressive blend of hilarity and poignancy, grit and sardonicism.
Wynne's dialogue is frequently so marvellous that I was reduced simply to
noting down my favourite lines, such as 'I hope he's cut down on those pot
noodles - he smelt like he had an alien up his arse last time.'
This is kitchen-sink drama in the 'everything but the . . .' sense. Young
Steven, a witness to his brother's burglary, lurks under a grey cloud of
petulance while sister Lizzie agonises about the morality of the 'dodgy
money' she earns at nights - another strong performance from Potts, matched
by Elizabeth Berrington as the irrepressible aunt to whom she unburdens
herself - and Ma Kelly keeps the family together in best Boswellian fashion.
Wynne somehow manages to put a triple twist into an almost wordless ending,
played out against the bathetic strains of Dionne Warwick.
The world is likely to hear from most of these writers again, and in Michael
Wynne's case this particular corner of the world can hardly wait.

The gross liabilities of Internationale Nederlanden Groep's deconsolidated
operations Orion Insurance and London and Overseas Insurance may be Dollars
1.5bn (Pounds 926m), provisional liquidators to the companies said, Reuter
reports from Amsterdam.
The two firms stopped taking on new business in 1992 and their operations
were deconsolidated from their Dutch parent in April 1993.
Price Waterhouse accountants Mr Paul Evans and Mr Richard Boys-Stones, who
were appointed provisional liquidators to Orion yesterday, said they had not
yet had an opportunity to examine the financial position of the underwriting
firms.
But 'it is thought that the gross liabilities might be of the order of
Dollars 1.5bn', they said.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: ASW in talks over French deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASW Holdings said yesterday it was in talks which may lead to it buying a
majority stake in Societe des Aciers d'Armature, the steel reinforcement
operations of Usinor Sacilor, the state-owned French steelmaker
A deal with Usinor would give the Cardiff-based steel products and
construction systems group its first steel plants outside the UK, ending a
long search for a sizeable European acquisition. It would increase its
workforce by more than 50 per cent to 3,400.
No price was disclosed, and ASW said a further announcement would be made
'when appropriate'.
Usinor, Europe's largest steelmaker, said the disposal of SAM, which
manufactures wire and rods for use in reinforced concrete, was part of its
strategy of concentrating on core activities.
Over the past few years, Usinor has been restructuring SAM, which suffered
losses of FFr270m (Pounds 32.4m) last year on sales of FFr2.3bn. The losses
partly reflected the depressed state of the construction market in 1993 and
the costs of renovating the company's furnaces.
The French group said SAM's results would show an improvement in 1994, while
industry observers said the subsidiary should come close to break even for
the year.
SAM has a total workforce of about 1,150 and produces concrete reinforcement
steels at two plants, one near Paris and the other in the Lorraine region.
It also controls several European wire mesh manufacturers, including Ludwig
of Germany, Ilro of Italy and Trefilarbed Gent of Belgium.
The negotiations with ASW are expected to involve the sale of a majority
stake in SAM, rather than the entire Usinor holding. The British group would
take management control.
Purchase of a stake would extend ASW's presence in the steel reinforcement
business, one of the products within its Allied Steel and Wire business.
A deal is likely to be followed by cost-cutting at SAM, observers believe.

Changes in the financial services division of Guardian Royal Exchange, the
insurance group, to provide a single support unit for both its direct sales
force and the sales agents who act as its appointed representatives will
mean the loss of 220 jobs in the next six months.
It will continue to run a separate service for supporting sales made through
independent financial advisers.
Guardian said yesterday some 60 of the jobs were either vacant or filled by
people transferring in the company.

FT  22 OCT 94 / BT and Mercury rivalry hots up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Competition between British Telecommunications and Mercury, its main rival,
is set to intensify after a report by BT claiming its service is cheaper not
only for typical home users but also for many high-volume users.
Mercury disputed some of the figures and pointed to its own discount
packages. But analysts saw the BT move as increasing pressure on Mercury to
cut its prices further to keep a competitive edge.
The BT report, verified by consultants Coopers and Lybrand, claimed that
even residential customers with phone bills well above Pounds 75 a quarter -
Mercury's target - are typically better off sticking with BT than switching
to its rival for long-distance and international calls.

A Pounds 1.5m campaign to raise educational standards in the West End of
Newcastle was launched yesterday.
Newcastle City Challenge, part of the government-backed scheme to regenerate
problem urban areas, says it is the first such project in the country. More
than a third of children in the targeted area enter secondary school at 11
with a reading age below that of an average eight year old.
Some of the money will be spent on extra teachers and on four education
access centres to help parents become actively involved in their children's
education.

Competition between British Telecommunications and Mercury, its main rival,
is set to intensify following a report by BT claiming that its service is
cheaper not only for typical home users but also for many high-volume users.
Mercury disputed some of the figures and pointed to its own discount
packages - but analysts saw the BT move as increasing the pressure on
Mercury to cut its prices further to retain a competitive edge.
The BT report, verified by consultants Coopers and Lybrand, claimed that
even residential customers with phone bills substantially above Pounds 75 a
quarter - Mercury's target market - are typically better off sticking with
BT than switching to its rival for long-distance and international calls.
The figures are based on what BT claims are typical calling patterns, and
include the range of discounts available to BT customers which Mercury
usually disregards when making its own pricing claims of 'guaranteed'
savings over BT.
The figures also assume that Mercury customers continue to make their local
calls via BT. Mercury has no local network and advises its customers to use
BT for local calls.
Analysts highlighted the comparison with the US, Australia and New Zealand,
where new telecoms companies competing with dominant operators have come
under increasing pressure as their initial success has forced the local
'giant' to cut its prices and market itself more effectively.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, the brokers, said:
'Mercury is now under such pressure that it cannot afford to maintain the
same price differentials as in the past.'
BT has been forced to cut its prices sharply by Oftel, the telecoms
regulator. Over this year its prices will have fallen by an average of about
12 per cent before taking account of inflation. Each BT price cut puts
pressure on its competitors to follow suit.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT managing director, said: 'This review compares like
with like, matching our best deal with their best deal, and we are better.'
Mercury said: 'The fact remains that Mercury's calls cost less than BT's
calls and for typical Mercury customers we beat BT hands down.'

FT  22 OCT 94 / First contract for Swans' rescuer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The company which has agreed to buy the Hebburn yard of Swan Hunter, the
Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, has won its first ship repair contract
for the site before the purchase deal has been legally completed.
On Thursday, the day the Hebburn yard's sale to Tees Dockyard is due to be
completed, the Stena Well Servicer, an offshore oil and gas field support
vessel, will arrive for overhaul and refurbishment.
The Hebburn site's buyers - who clinched their purchase agreement 10 days
ago with receivers Price Waterhouse - have started interviewing ex-Swan
Hunter employees and jobless Tyneside ship repair workers.
They need to recruit 100 temporary workers for the three-week Stena
contract, but those taken on have the prospect of becoming part of the new
permanent core workforce at Hebburn, expected to reach 200 within a year.
Yesterday Mr Eric Welsh, managing director of Tees Dockyard and chief
executive of its new Hebburn business, Tyne Tees Dockyard, said the speed
with which the first contract had been won had raised eyebrows. 'It's come
so fast,' said Mr Welsh. 'Everybody on the Tyne is delighted.'
The six-figure contract was won in competition against a Rotterdam ship
repairer. Mr Welsh was particularly pleased to get a vessel into Hebburn on
the first day of ownership. 'It will start paying for itself straight away.'
Other contracts for Hebburn are under negotiation including serious
inquiries from Norwegian shipping fleets. 'I would guess the next two to
three contracts will employ over 200,' he said.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Israel shells guerrillas in Lebanon

Israel shelled suspected Islamic guerrilla positions in south Lebanon
yesterday after a wave of rocket attacks struck northern Israel.
Mr Uri Lubrani, Israel's co-ordinator for Lebanon, said there was no
evidence to suggest a co-ordinated military operation between Hamas, the
group responsible for Wednesday's bus bombing in Tel Aviv, and Lebanon's
Iranian-backed Hizbollah or Party of God, which sent five waves of
Soviet-made missiles into Israel. The missile attacks forced residents of
northern areas into bomb shelters. There were no reports of casualties.
Mr Lubrani said there was a union of purpose between the two groups and
Tehran to strike terror in the heart of Israel and derail efforts at Middle
East peace. 'They are a tumour - a malignant tumour - which pollutes Islam
and they are dedicated to the destruction of the peace process,' he said.
Amid escalating violence between Israel and its Islamic opponents inside and
outside the Holy Land, a senior Iranian spiritual leader said yesterday the
Hamas bus bomb which killed 21 people in Tel Aviv showed that peace pacts
between Israel and Arab leaders could not solve the Palestinian problem.
Ayatollah Ahmad Janati said peace agreements had no impact on the continuing
struggle between Israel and 'the Moslem people' and he attacked the
Palestine Liberation Organisation for arresting Hamas activists. The PLO, he
said, 'has turned into an Israeli tool to suppress the Moslems'.
In Israel signs of the deep social divisions left after this week's bus
attack were apparent as right-wing Israelis shouting 'Death to Arabs'
clashed with peace supporters holding a vigil at the site of the attack in
the commercial centre of Tel Aviv.
Police had to separate the two groups after several peace demonstrators were
beaten up.
Despite the violence Israel reaffirmed yesterday it would continue peace
talks with the PLO.
Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, is to meet PLO representatives in
Cairo tomorrow. Officials said the two sides would discuss recent attacks by
Hamas guerrillas and ways to ensure progress in stalled talks over the long
delayed transfer of power from Israeli to Palestinian hands in the occupied
West Bank.
Discussions will also centre on plans to hold Palestinian elections.
The talks will be marred by Israel's closure of the Gaza Strip and West Bank
and its recent talk of tough security measures against Hamas.
While an opinion poll showed yesterday that 80 per cent of Israelis favour a
permanent closure and stringent security measures against Hamas, some
Israelis believe the government must adopt a political rather than military
strategy.
Mr Alon Ben-Meir, professor of international relations at New York
University, criticised Israel yesterday for trying to exclude Hamas from
Palestinian elections. In an article in the Jerusalem Post, Prof Ben-Meir
said Hamas represented Palestinians with genuine political grievances which
needed a political solution.

Al Arqam, the Moslem sect banned by the Malaysian government, was yesterday
formulating its response to a TV appearance by its leader, Mr Ashaari
Mohamad, in which he appeared to go back on his beliefs. Mr Ashaari,
answering questions from a panel of Malaysian Islamic scholars, admitted
deviationist beliefs and promised to try to change the minds of followers
whom he had misled. Al Arqam, which says it has 100,000 followers in
Malaysia and more in the region, was banned in August for spreading what the
government called deviationist Islamic teachings. About 55 per cent of
Malaysia's population are Moslems. Mr Ashaari and six other Al Arqam members
were arrested last month under Malaysia's Internal Security Act.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Private View: Modest monk with a diplomatic mission - Dr
Rewata Dhamma is a Buddhist who has made an impact on international affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Buddhist monk living in Birmingham, England, is the improbable channel
through which Burma's military junta has been seeking to end the country's
diplomatic isolation.
The Venerable Dr Rewata Dhamma acted as intermediary for a historic meeting
a month ago between the two senior military men in Myanmar (as Burma has
been renamed) and the pro-democracy leader and Nobel peace prize winner Ms
Aung San Suu Kyi, put under house arrest by the military more than five
years ago.
Western diplomats were initially sceptical that an innocent-looking teacher
of Buddhist meditation, philosophy and scripture, a scholar of Hindi and
Sanskrit, could play such a delicate role. There were suspicions that the
generals might try to use him as part of a propaganda effort to improve the
standing of a regime repeatedly denounced for its abuses of human rights.
Yet the fact is that the promised parley with Ms Suu Kyi did occur within
weeks of Rewata Dhamma's second visit to Rangoon this year.
The ground was prepared in May this year, when, armed with a visa from the
Burmese ambassador, he entered the country and met Lt Gen Khin Nyunt, head
of military intelligence and first secretary of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (Slorc).
'I think I was the first Burmese to say to him directly to free her. He
explained that the army was divided and her detention was a matter of
security. But I feel he was honest, genuine.'
On the second visit he met Gen Khin Nyunt again, and this time was given
permission to see Ms Suu Kyi.
'She was very strong, cheerful, very happy. Also her husband was there. We
talked for three hours.'
She was less concerned about herself than about the other political
prisoners, he said. She also seemed to accept that poor education and
economic instability might delay the restoration of democracy. But she asked
to see General Than Shwe, the head of Slorc, to discuss things directly.
The abbot then met the head of Slorc and a few weeks later, her wish was
granted.
The modest-seeming monk is not new to unofficial diplomacy, nor to
international platforms. He has spoken at peace conferences in Moscow and
Tokyo and at UN assemblies in New York and Geneva. Furthermore, he appears
to enjoy the highest standing and connections in Burma, the country of his
birth. Today, he is being pursued by the television networks who want to
make him a media star.
Our meeting place was as improbable as his mission, a detached house
converted into a Buddhist temple near the Brent reservoir off London's North
Circular Road. The abbot (as I shall call him for convenience) produced two
photographs: the first showed a slender, attractive and cheerful-looking Suu
Kyi, sitting on the floor at his feet in her house in Rangoon, the second a
group of military men in similarly respectful attitudes on the floor of the
guesthouse where he met them.
He also showed me a translation of a letter from her after his August visit.
Signed 'Suu Suu', it thanked him for his attention, advice and compassion
and urged him to see a throat specialist for the weakness of his voice
which, she wrote, might be caused by chewing betel nut.
The abbot first met Suu Kyi in Benares, India, when she was a little girl
and her mother was the Burmese envoy. Her father, Gen Aung San, Burma's
resistance hero, had been assassinated in 1947 by rivals on the eve of
independence from Britain.
They met again regularly when Suu Kyi studied at Oxford University (she
later married Michael Aris, an Oxford don) and the abbot had left India to
become a missionary to the west from his base in Birmingham.
The abbot was born Shwe Maung in 1929 - he looks too young for 65 - in the
Irawaddy delta. Although the only son among five children he joined the
Theravada order of Buddhist monks at the age of 12. A prize-winning student,
he was awarded a state scholarship - the first and only Buddhist monk to get
one - to study Hindi and Sanskrit in India, where he completed a PhD,
lectured, wrote commentaries and edited, among other works, an encyclopaedia
of Buddhist technical terms.
When in 1962 the Burmese government of U Nu was toppled in a military coup
led by General Ne Win, the abbot found himself an exile. When later U Nu, a
devout Buddhist, himself arrived in India for medical treatment he struck up
a friendship with Dr Dhamma. This was enough, said the doctor, to get his
name blacklisted in Burma. It was to be 30 years before he saw his homeland
again.
While in India, the abbot said, he was asked by Indira Gandhi, the late
prime minister, to dissuade U Nu from going back to fight the Burmese junta.
Then in 1974 he was asked by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, exiled ruler of
Cambodia, to go to Peking and conduct a religious service for the prince's
ailing mother. He carried a diplomatic message from Mrs Gandhi to the
Chinese leaders.
I asked the abbot why he landed up in Birmingham.
He replied in his indistinct English: 'I did not know it. I never heard of
Birmingham before.' He chuckled. 'Also, I wanted to learn English so I could
use my knowledge - so more people could understand Buddhism.'
You saw the English-speaking world as a promising place for Buddhism?
'I felt so, yes, because many Americans were becoming Buddhist - Europeans
also. Many people came east to learn Buddhism in the sixties.'
Was it difficult to go to a strange, cold island in the north Atlantic?
'I don't feel like it was difficult. I don't know why but I just found it
very homely. I don't have any problems here, even physically.' He chuckled
again. 'I had no colds: many English have fevers.'
There was one difficulty: opening a bank account. In Burma, there are no
surnames, and the abbot had in any case adopted the single religious name
'Rewatadhamma'.
'The manager asked for my Christian name,' he said, 'I told him I don't have
a Christian name. And no surname either.' He laughed. 'So to make things
easier I made two words of 'Rewatadhamma'.'
He arrived with a letter of introduction from U Nu to Lord Mountbatten, who
was later murdered by the IRA, and went to see him.
Were you tired of India?
'No, no. I wanted to teach meditation to the westerners. India doesn't need
teachers of Buddhism so much. It has a whole tradition.'
So it was missionary work?
'Missionary work, yes.'
Birmingham now had 10 Buddhist centres, he said, and there were about
125,000 English-born Buddhists (not including the 50-60,000 Asian Buddhist
immigrants), more in Germany and France. He has been doing missionary work
in eastern Europe. 'Now they are free from communism they are looking for
something different,' he explained.
'The Buddha says if you are ill, what you need is medicine. It's not
important who gives it to you, whether the doctor is American, English,
Jewish, Christian or Buddhist. It releases the mind from strains and helps
you make good decisions; it teaches us how to see things objectively.'
I asked if he was surprised to find himself in the news.
'Not very much. Even if I try and hide myself now I cannot really escape,
because this is very important news now.'
Do you enjoy the attention?
'Not really . . . But it is good for the country.'
Before his missions to Rangoon, the abbot had approached the UN secretariat
in New York and the US State Department where officials encouraged his
attempt to find out what was preventing the generals from releasing Aung San
Suu Kyi and handing over power following the 1990 elections in which her
National League for Democracy won 60 per cent of the vote.
He explained the Buddhist method of mediation as follows: 'I always say like
this. We have to learn how to listen to others' problems. When you know
their problem, then you will get a good solution.
'Also you try to do it with loving kindness, compassion. If someone is very
angry, he can't do anything. He is suffering, so he can't do this good
thing. And the same thing if I am feeling anger: I cannot listen to others.
My ego, my personality - I am right, the other is wrong - is a block in the
way of understanding.
'So when you are talking to both sides, you dispel your ego, your
personality and just listen. Then you present your own feelings and try to
reconcile them to each other. And that way you get a solution.'
Dr Rewata Dhamma has been invited back to Rangoon next month. The military,
he said, wanted to talk to him about the place of Buddhism, the creed of an
estimated 85 per cent of the multi-ethnic population, in the socialist Union
of Myanmar.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Who will wake us from our slumber?: Peter Aspden says the
need for a new Nietzsche - a wild and wise thinker - has never been greater
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Considering he was regarded as one of the towering intellects of his
generation, appointed a university professor at the age of 24, and
acknowledged as a seminal influence on some of the greatest literary and
philosophical figures of the century, Friedrich Nietzsche has been
ill-served by the caprices of historical judgment.
There are certainly easy jokes to be made at his expense. His invention of
the Ubermensch was a gift to today's pop culture plunderers, who never miss
an opportunity, as in the cover of Philosophy for Beginners, to dress him in
underpants-outside-tights and flowing cape.
In more sophisticated circles, mere mention of his name is enough to raise a
guaranteed hoot of derision. In A Fish Called Wanda, Kevin Kline's loose
hold on reality is confirmed when he wanders around reading extracts from
Ecce Homo. Woody Allen, in a characteristic fog of existential angst in
Hannah and her Sisters, contemplates becoming a Nietzschean, but decides
against because the theory of eternal recurrence means he would 'have to sit
through the Ice Capades again'.
The pathetic intellectual decline of Nietzsche's final years, as he marauded
the elegant squares of Turin in a syphilitic haze, have not helped his cause
either. As the tone of his aphorisms became more savage, as his vision of
transcendence turned into an unhinged apparition of despair, yes, he did
indeed become mad. But should that remain the final word on his legacy?
Nietzsche died, with untypical neatness, in 1900; but has any figure cast a
greater shadow over the torments of the 20th century?
Over the past week, select groups of devotees all over Europe and the US
have celebrated the 150th anniversary of Nietzsche's birth. At the
Goethe-Institut in London, on a Friday night, three philosophers attracted a
near-capacity audience to hear their difficult papers.
It would not be too much of an exaggeration to talk of a thriving cottage
industry; as one member of the audience remarked during a tetchy exchange:
'I don't think too many of us would be here if this was an evening about
Kant.' Nietzsche has pulling-power; he speaks, with increasing authority, to
the modern sensibility. The philosopher who announced the end of God has a
place in the cosmic debating chamber, it seems, after the end of history.
In truth, like Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, his fellow 'modern masters of
suspicion' as the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur put it, Nietzsche has been
too easily marginalised by today's cultural commentators. Knock down the
Berlin Wall, expose a few fraudulent psychoanalysts, laugh at the lunatic
excesses of Zarathustra and we are rid of all three in one fell swoop,
primed and proud for the post-historical, post-industrial, post-modern age
of . . . well, what exactly?
It is not as if we are over-flowing with fresh ideas and original values for
the new millennium (we can't even decide, in Britain at least, how to spend
the money allotted to trumpet its arrival). Many of today's philosophers
spend their time huddled over grammatical oddities or looking for truth in a
software programme. They publish papers on it, and the more papers they
publish the more research money they receive. It is considered rude to ask
them what they are doing, and naive to look to them for genuine illumination
on how to live our lives.
The need for another Nietzsche has never been greater: a bracing thinker,
wild and wise, who can wake us from our slumber. He and his cohorts set the
dark, disturbing agenda for the new century; instead of listening, we
wilfully misunderstood and ended with the atrocities of two world wars.
The post-war western world settled into the comforting homilies of
consumerism and the playful banter of the mass media to try and forget, but
it has not proved easy. In Bosnia, in parts of Africa, in the Middle East,
we are reminded daily that we are, in the great man's words, human, all too
human.

FT  22 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: Anchors, engineers and great powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany is a great power, as the elections there show. A great power is one
that has elections which others define in the light of their own national
interests.
Britain receives a limited version of that compliment because of the
obstructive nature of its European policies. On the other hand, no newspaper
outside Italy interpreted the outcome of that country's election in terms of
what it meant for its readers. But Germany is so treated whether it likes it
or not: it is a big country, it has the biggest national income in Europe
and it has borders with nine other nations.
In the past that has spelt trouble. It might do so again. In the meantime,
each nation sees chancellor Kohl as a Father Christmas, who can give them
nice presents, or a policeman who might, with luck, be cajoled into adopting
a helpful attitude. Thus in Budapest, Nepszabadsag wrote: 'From a Central
European perspective, Kohl's re-election may be especially good news as he
may fulfil his pledge of ushering the countries of Central Europe, among
which Hungary is numbered, into the European Union and Nato.'
In Britain, the papers disagreed among themselves. The Times argued that the
British should ally themselves with Germany to create a free trading
north-western axis in Europe.
The Daily Telegraph said they should 'build alliances with those within the
union who prefer consolidation before contemplating further development'.
The French similarly viewed the German election from one point of view. In
this case it was the alleged need for what they grandly call the
construction of Europe. And, curiously enough, the conclusion reached by
most of the press was one which showed the possibilities of some kind of new
entente with the British.
The French are obsessed with proposals which envisage the creation of a
'hard core' composed of Germany, France and the Benelux countries which
would make their own little union. Le Figaro called this 'squaring the
circle' for it would permit the union to develop greater cohesion while
allowing it to expand at the same time.
Elsewhere all is hostility. Sud-Ouest wrote that Germany is anxious to
organise the Europe of which it dreams: 'A pledge of peace and a market
made-to-measure.'
InfoMatin said Germany was adopting a take-it-or-leave-it policy. That, if
pursued, would unleash a noisy wave of objections in France from
anti-Maastricht elements. These include personalities near to the tough
interior minister, Charles Pasqua, who 'do not hesitate to compare the
geographical limits of the 'hard core' with the frontiers of the Holy Roman
Empire.' They now believe that anyone who says 'yes' to the Germans are
incorrigible 'Vichyists'. In other words, going along with the German
project is a form of treason.
Most agreed that since Chancellor Kohl was now in his last term in office he
was going to do all he could to achieve the integration of Europe, just as
he had achieved German unification.
Once again we see the growing complexity of intra-European relationships.
The British bitterly oppose the creation of a hard-core club they would not
join anyway. They want expansion, which, they hope, could scupper the idea
of more integration. The French want more integration, to drive the union
ever closer together, so long as they are doing the driving. They have
supreme faith in their own ideas until they emanate from Germans.
In Germany there is continued reluctance to accept the country's new role.
It is one which many had hoped would never be assumed again in the light of
the catastrophic results of previous experiments in German leadership.
A surprised Die Welt remarked: 'Whoever glances beyond our frontiers is
amazed. Kohl's re-election finds an overwhelming echo of admiration abroad,
far better than the CDU bosses could have dreamed. There, everybody speaks
of the guarantor of stability, of his reliable style of government, of a
locomotive for integration and many other laudatory epithets.
That there is a small parliamentary majority is noted with regret. What is
stressed is the strength of German democracy, its desire for partnership and
its stability.'
This is the great paradox. The Germans themselves speak of the need to keep
Germany firmly anchored in Europe. But the more firmly it is anchored, the
more Germany becomes the motor and the more it risks being seen as too
powerful and a threat. You do not need an engineer to picture what happens
when someone starts up what is either a firmly anchored motor or a motorised
anchor.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Sport: Clouds drift across the Italian game - Football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Italian football first became available to British television viewers,
it was like a breath of fresh air sweeping through the rancid mediocrity of
Britain's domestic game.
Here was glamour, technical virtuosity, passion without violence, and the
pick of the world's finest players strutting in front of capacity crowds in
magnificent stadiums. Oh, and the sun always shone.
It might be something of an exaggeration to say that the positions of these
two giant footballing nations have reversed, but not much.
Today, it is considerably more difficult to get a ticket to watch Newcastle
United than Inter Milan, one is more likely to be stoned or bottled inside
an Italian ground than virtually any other in Europe and, if you were
manager of a World XI about to face Mars, Alan Shearer and Andy Cole would
figure more prominently in your thoughts as a twin spearhead attack than
Gigi Casiraghi and Daniele Massaro.
These are troubled times for the Italian football establishment. Last
Sunday, three of the traditionally dominant powers in the game, Inter Milan,
AC Milan and Juventus, all lost, the first time this had happened for no
less than 28 years.
None of them looks like being a main contender in this year's championship,
although Fabio Capello's AC Milan cannot be discounted so soon after their
stunning 4-0 victory over Barcelona in last year's European Cup final.
With Roma topping the table, and Parma, Lazio and Foggia snapping at their
heels, a new order is threatening to take over, prompting the inevitable
question: are standards levelling upwards or downwards?
A look at the fortunes of Arrigo Sacchi's national side provides telling
evidence of the latter view.
It may seem strange that a side that managed to reach the World Cup final
and only lost on penalties to the best footballing nation on earth should,
just a few months later, be in the throes of a crisis; but the cries for
Sacchi's removal are getting ever stronger, and his plea for patience, after
three years at the helm, is beginning to look a little desperate.
A fortunate draw against Slovenia, followed by a none-too-convincing victory
over Estonia, was not the ideal start to Italy's campaign to qualify for the
1996 European Championship in England; and next month Sacchi's side faces a
confident Croatian team which can call on Lazio's in-form Alen Boksic and AC
Milan's Zvonimir Boban for inspiration.
In truth, Italy's World Cup adventure, which relied entirely on Roberto
Baggio's flashes of brilliance and some very stubborn defending, hugely
flattered the quality of their football.
Where was the class and creativity in midfield for which the great Italian
sides were famous?
Nicola Berti, Dino Baggio and Demetrio Albertini, all fine box-to-box
foragers, would not have looked out of place in a Graham Taylor side, while
the two most exciting members of Sacchi's squad, Gianfranco Zola and Beppe
Signori, were unable to win regular places in his line-up.
That they are still not automatic selections is an illustration of Sacchi's
confused tactical thinking, as is his persistence with the ponderous
Casiraghi, who has been warming the bench at Lazio for most of the last
year.
It is hard to imagine him even being considered for a place in England's
current squad, such is the embarrassment of riches available to Terry
Venables in attack.
As for Roberto Baggio, a moody and sensitive player at the best of times, he
is still struggling to shake off the niggling injuries which were so
apparent in his remarkable performances in the US.
His cause is hardly being advanced by playing for a stale Juventus side
which has plumbed new depths of tedium in its opening to the season.
Alongside Baggio is Gianluca Vialli, who might be said to be the living
metaphor of the torpor afflicting the nation's football.
Once the golden boy of Sampdoria and the effervescent national side
assembled so skilfully by Azeglio Vicini, Vialli, slowed by injuries and
painfully lacking in self-confidence, is beginning to wear the haunted look
of one who knows his best days are long past.
He has once more shaved his head in a vain effort to induce an illusion of
sleekness, but he looks - and occasionally plays - more like Marlon Brando's
renegade Colonel Kurtz at the end of Apocalypse Now.
The sight of Vialli and his even more statuesque team-mate, Fabrizio
Ravanelli, labouring up front for this most famous of teams in world
football, before a half-full Stadio delle Alpi on a foggy, Turinese
afternoon is not what we have come to expect at all.
Who will bring the sunshine back to Italian football?

FT  22 OCT 94 / Sport: Born to be partners - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A spirited win in this week's Marlboro Championships in Hong Kong by Byron
and Wayne Black over world No 1 Pete Sampras and fellow American Todd
Martin, ranked nine, took me back to a day in the mid-1950s.
The Black brothers' father, Rhodesia's leading Davis Cup player Don Black,
had put up with my inadequacies as a partner on the day in question to steer
us to victory in the British Covered Court Championships at Queen's Club.
They were carefree days as we made our impecunious way around the world
following the sun. Then, after getting the wanderlust out of our systems,
and accepting that we would never win Wimbledon, we returned to the real
world to make our livings and raise our families.
Don Black went home to Rhodesia and shrewdly invested his modest savings in
a piece of rich farmland in Mandara, 10 miles from the centre of Salisbury.
He built a couple of grass tennis courts so that he could maintain his links
with the game as captain of the Rhodesian Davis Cup team.
In 1965 Don married Velia Williams, from South Africa, whom he had met at a
party after she returned from a short spell as a dancer on the London stage.
Byron was born in 1969, Wayne four years later, and both boys inherited
their parents' athleticism. Almost before they could walk Don had put short,
sawn-off rackets into their hands and they virtually grew up on the tennis
court.
On November 11 1965, a few months after Don and Velia's marriage, prime
minister Ian Smith declared UDI and gradually the sanctions that were
imposed began to bite.
Velia said: 'Our business was ruined. Don had to turn to coaching to make
ends meet. It was a nightmare. Then came war with all its hardships.'
After Robert Mugabe became prime minister of the new Zimbabwe in 1980, Don
built three more grass courts, plus a hard court, and developed his coaching
business.
Meanwhile, Byron's career was taking off. He was considered the best junior
in Zimbabwe with an unusual double-handed style on both wings. 'It was just
natural. Dad never tried to change me, he just motivated and encouraged me,'
he said.
At 15, Byron won the All Africa Championships in the Cote d'Ivoire. This
earned him a place on one of the new squads for promising juniors set up by
the International Tennis Federation with help from the Grand Slam
Development Fund, which is financed by a Dollars 2m annual contribution made
by the Compaq Grand Slam Cup.
Wayne and his 15-year-old sister Cara, have enjoyed help from this scheme.
Byron's French Open doubles victory this year with American Jonathan Stark
has lifted him to a world doubles ranking of No 4. 'It was a tremendous
thrill, second only to my win over Ivan Lendl at Queen's last year. That
showed me that I could live with these guys.'
For Don and Velia their proudest moment was in 1986 when Byron, aged 17, had
beat the experienced Nigerian Tour player, N'duka Odizor, in a Davis Cup tie
in Harare. The crowd went wild and before the Nigerian team departed its
manager, Jacob Akendele, left an envelope for Byron with instructions for it
not to be opened until they had left.
Inside were a few hundred dollars and a note which said: 'There are only
three great players in the world - Borg, Becker and Black. This is to help
you buy your first stringing machine. Good luck.'
Byron and Wayne have avoided injury and since 1993 have formed the
Zimbabwean Davis Cup team, something few brothers have achieved: David and
John Lloyd were members of the UK team that reached the final in 1978, while
Vijay and Anand Amritraj did the same for India in 1987.
But only one pair of siblings has appeared in winning Davis Cup teams - the
Doherty brothers, Reggie and Laurie, who achieved four successes for the UK
between 1903 and 1906.
The dream for Don and Velia Black is that, one day, their boys might become
the second.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Motoring: A public test of their metal - A look at the
British International Motor Show in Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Insiders are inclined to dismiss the British International Motor Show,
opening to the public today at the National Exhibition Centre near
Birmingham as a re-run of the Paris Mondiale de l'Automobile (this column,
October 8).
Inevitably, the Paris show up-staged the British event. All the 1995 models
were there; even the UK's new Jaguar XJs and Range Rover made their world
debut in Paris, not Birmingham, though Toyota thought differently and chose
the UK show for the European unveiling of its Lexus LS400 and Celica
Cabriolet. Which is only a reflection of how international the motor
industry has become.
In fact, most of the people who will crowd into the NEC for the next eight
days will almost certainly be Midlanders and northerners. Southerners prefer
the London Motor Show, held at Earl's Court Arena on alternate years to
Birmingham.
When the traditional annual motor show left London for Birmingham in 1978
and became biennial, the Earl's Court Motorfair was started to fill the gap.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, which has always run the
'official' show, disapproved of Motorfair at first but soon adopted it.
This year, the British International Motor Show has followed a lead given by
the former upstart Motorfair. For the first time in 91 years, visitors can
actually buy things on the exhibition floor. No, not yet cars. But a wide
range of accessories and components awaits buyers in a 55,000 sq ft retail
pavilion.
The show's main value is that it gives Britons their first chance to see in
the metal the cars they have so far only seen pictured. One is the
light-alloy Audi A8 luxury saloon, offered as a 2.8-litre V6 with
front-wheel drive, or as a 4.2-litre V8 with quattro transmission. Alfa
Romeo's highly individual 145 hatchback is also there, although, sadly, not
the toothsome new Spider.
Main interest on the BMW stand centres on the 3-Series Compact, due to sell
from Pounds 13,350 and set to take BMW into Ford Escort, VW Golf, Vauxhall
Astra and Honda Civic territory. At the other extreme is the marque's
flagship - the 5 - litre, V12-engined, long-wheelbase version of the new
7-Series.
Citroen's Xantia-based Xanae concept car and the Ludo, Renault's idea of a
town car for the young and active, should not be missed. The Ludo has
sliding doors and runs on liquid petroleum gas (LPG). Renault says it
approaches the environmental cleanliness of an electric vehicle but can be
refuelled in a couple of minutes and has a range of 250 miles (400kms). The
Ludo's automatic clutch will, incidentally, soon be available on the Clio.
The multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) developed by PSA (Peugeot Citroen Group) and
Fiat can be seen on all three companies' stands.
Ford's Galaxy MPV - another joint effort, this time with Volkswagen - also
threatens to end the Renault Espace's long domination of the European MPV
market.
For buyers who stick firmly to the tarmac, part of the attraction of
on/off-road 4x4 vehicles - like Land Rover's Discovery - is their elevated
(Land Rover calls it 'command') driving position. Thus, their makers and
importers will be watching keenly the market performance of the new breed of
European MPVs - which also have high-up driving positions, plus lots of
interior space and generally car-like ride and handling.
For the time being, though, sales of the 4x4s are standing up well, even if
prices for the poshest ones approach stratospheric levels.
Interestingly, Mitsubishi's stand at Birmingham features a 2.9-litre,
turbo-diesel version of the five-door Shogun, due in the UK early next year
at about Pounds 22,500. It is equipped less elaborately than the original
but looks more elegant.
Two other 4x4s are well worth looking at. They are a prototype of a much
better-looking, more powerful and easier to load Lada Niva Cossack, due to
go on sale next year; and the quaintly-named but most attractive Ssangyong
Musso. This rugged, four-wheel drive, five-door estate from Korea has a
Mercedes-Benz five-cylinder diesel and will be on sale in Subaru and Isuzu
dealerships in the spring. Prices are likely to be from Pounds 16,000 to
Pounds 21,000.
If you fancy an affordable sports car, do not miss the Vauxhall Tigra and
the eye-catching new Fiat Coupe. UK sales of the Tigra - with which I shall
be dealing more fully next week - are less than a month away. The Fiat's
British launch is not until next year but, if the Coupe is as well built and
competitively priced as the Punto, it could be worth waiting for.
Much further off is the market launch of Mercedes-Benz's small SLK sports
car, being shown at Birmingham as a concept. It has a steel top that
power-folds into the body.
The show is open to the public from today until Sunday, October 30, from
9.30am until 7pm (5.30pm on the final day). Admission is Pounds 8 (children
and senior citizens Pounds 4); the NEC charges Pounds 5 for parking. The
organisers recommend travelling by train to Birmingham International, which
is in the middle of the exhibition complex. Combined rail and motor show
tickets are available from most stations.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Outdoors: Heavenly flowers to make October bright - Robin
Lane Fox suggests a new approach to autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past two months have been so exceptionally kind to gardens that they
must make us all think again about our style.
So many of us concentrate on the year's familiar points: the daffodils in
spring, the magnolias, the June rush and the cascade of roses before any
surviving bedding plants take over the show. But a golden October reminds us
that gardening is more than a three-month wonder.
There is something odd about one's style in late autumn and early winter.
Somehow, the individual flowers seem to go together naturally; their colours
are more clear and pure.
Perhaps a lack of choice concentrates the mind. There are fewer plants that
produce blooms in October, but I find that they have a distinction that
often disappears when the entire world of flowers is available in July.
Lack of choice first forced me to make an experiment which I now recommend
to anyone. I bless the day that I ignored the experts and went over to
growing schizostylis in a dry garden, which they are supposed to hate. One
of their best suppliers even laughed at the idea when I proposed it at a
recent flower show.
Schizostylis have pale, rushy leaves and long stems of flowers with rounded
petals in pink and white, curving to a length of nearly 2ft. For three years
now, they have multiplied and extended their season from August to November
in my dry garden without any trouble.
In the wild, these heavenly flowers are known as Kaffir lillies. In Britain,
they are much less popular than the shocking pink nerines (or Guernsey
lillies), but I can pay them no higher tribute than to say they are just as
good.
They seem to relish life in gaps between paving slabs where they can find a
cool root. And while they seldom appear in London, they would be marvellous
experiments for sunny, paved front gardens where you could take out the
occasional slab, improve a square of soil and pack in a Kaffir carpet
varying between pink and scarlet.
In my garden, they keep good company with a plant which would be the darling
of every expert if it was not so easy and available so widely. The brilliant
blue ceratostigma Willmottianum is the outstanding small shrub to a height
of just over 2ft in September and October.
The flowers of this infallible Chinese shrub are a brilliant cobalt blue
and, if you plant a few bushes under a sunny wall of your house, you can
then put the pink and red schizostylis in open squares among the paving
stones which link the house to the lawn.
The same possibilities are present 10 times over among Michaelmas daisies:
clear colours, a long season between different varieties, and easy
companionship with other strong shades of yellow or white. I like the late
blues such as Blue Down, the small-flowered Little Carlow and the tall
Calliope amid the strong yellows and shocking pinks of autumn-flowering
bulbs.
Among the bother of ordering and planting next year, many people forget they
could be enjoying shocking-pink nerines and the brilliant yellow Sternbergia
as bulbs in October.
Order them next spring and give them a dry, sunny place. A few bulbs soon go
a long way because they are better if divided after several years:
otherwise, the small, yellow Sternbergia will run to leaves rather than
buds.
If these clear colours leave you short of white, head for the hardy Japanese
anemones which are neglected only by unwise planters who think these plants
are, somehow, too common. For big groups, I think ordinary Japanese White
Alba remains the answer - the simplest and still the best. Once again, all
the experts would long for it if only it was more difficult to grow.
The same sort of people seldom want to mention a chrysanthemum, for much the
same reasons. Here, too, the botanists are behaving as if these fuss-pots
are right and are trying to re-name chrysanthemums as dendranthemums in a
spectacular fit of botanical 'correctness'.
I believe, however, that this family contains some excellent garden plants.
The single-flowered hardy forms are often lovely if you place them carefully
in borders and do not abandon them to a special corner where you will use
them for nothing but picking. The best give an extra month's life to fading
borders.
Everybody has a favourite but I must push my two latest discoveries, which
have flourished in this singular year. Weyrichii is a low-growing,
white-flowered form which seems to spread easily in a dry soil and lights up
the front of the border with a last, white splash.
Among the late blue daisies, I also have a small-flowered number known as
Doctor Tomm Parr, which seems to be as tough as nails and colours itself in
rusty red flowers. These forms, and their hardy relations, have a clarity
which is much rarer among flowers in high summer.
If you do not hide them away in beds for cutting only, you can develop a
style with a new range of colours which staves off the sad moment when the
garden finally heads for bed.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Outdoors: Stormed off the mountain - FT Ski Expedition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are trying to ski every day of 1994. They are
in New Zealand
October came in like a Canterbury lamb but it is going out like the All
Blacks. As we prepare for the last leg of our adventure - back to the US -
we have had some of the fiercest weather of the year.
At Mount Hutt, on New Zealand's South Island, we were caught in a ferocious
hail storm which arrived from nowhere and closed the mountain.
Visibility was reduced to nil, ice balls blasted our faces and thunder
roared above us as we tried to find our way back to the base lodge. The
eight-mile drive down to the town of Methven was fraught: roads to most NZ
ski fields are unpaved and have hairpin bends and sheer drops without
barriers.
At Porter Heights, howling gales which peppered us with more ice balls shut
the lifts one by one until the resort admitted defeat and closed.
Ohau - New Zealand's smallest commercial ski area, although claiming the
country's longest T-bar - also had to close for a day or so but the owners,
Mike and Louise Neilson, obligingly helped us ski with the aid of their snow
cat. When that broke down, we walked up. Booked in for two nights, we stayed
seven, skiing deep snow off the Ohau's challenging High Traverse when
conditions allowed.
With most ski fields in NZ closing around us, Ohau, Porter Heights and Mount
Hutt have all gone out of their way to keep the FT ski odyssey on track.
Jenny and John Fairbrass, managers at the Alpine Lodge at Porter Heights -
where we also spent seven nights instead of the two allotted  - kept our
morale high with piping hot meals, squeaky-clean accommodation and good
conversation.
Porter Heights, the closest commercial ski field to Christchurch, the South
Island's biggest town, has some of the best ungroomed terrain in the
Canterbury ski fields. Big Mamma, a two-mile descent, is one of the longest
and steepest off-piste runs in the country.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Property: Match-maker selling - How vendors can bypass
estate agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGINA OVERELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Brian Laister put his Welsh holiday cottage on the market, he wanted to
attract as many potential buyers as possible. He decided against using an
estate agent and registered with a computer matching agency.
'My wife heard about computer matching and suggested the idea to me,' he
explains. 'Because the details go on to a database which contains a national
network of people who might be interested, I thought it would be a good
thing to try.' Within a few weeks the Laisters had a buyer, and the sale
looks likely to go ahead.
Computer matching agencies operate in a similar way to the Dateline lonely
hearts operation by putting vendors and potential buyers in touch. Once
clients have each other's details, it is up to them to arrange the sale
although, like Dateline, the agencies cannot guarantee a perfect match.
One of the main attractions of computer matching is that the fees are
considerably cheaper than estate agents', who charge, on average, about 2
per cent for sole agency. On a house sold for Pounds 250,000, this works out
at Pounds 5,875 (including value added tax), whereas the maximum charge by a
computer matching agency for the same sale would be only Pounds 575.
There are now three companies operating nationwide in the UK, all
established during the depressed housing market of the past few years.
Laister's cottage is registered with Link-Up Properties Nationwide based in
Haywards Heath, West Sussex. It charges vendors a Pounds 75 registration fee
for a six-month period. This includes the cost of advertising the property
in a national newspaper and vetting the responses. Buyers register free.
If a sale is agreed within the first eight weeks, Link-Up charges commission
of Pounds 250 (inc VAT) for properties worth less than Pounds 100,000 and
Pounds 500 (inc VAT) for those worth more. As its profit is made when people
sell inside the eight-week period, there is a strong incentive to match
suitable buyers and sellers as quickly and accurately as possible. At
present, it has around 20,000 people on its database.
Even Julian King, its director, is a little surprised by how quickly the
idea has caught on. 'The whole concept of Link-Up Properties arrived around
the depressed market place and our aim was to inject a little bit more
activity into it. When it was established, I didn't imagine it growing at
the rate it has. Certainly, over the past two years we have gone from
strength to strength and we are achieving a very high level of success.'
National Selections, based in Ealing, west London, is the smallest of the
three agencies. It charges a registration payment of Pounds 88.13 for six
months. The fee covers a computer matching service but individual properties
are not advertised in the press.
Director Paul Brooks believes matching services act as a useful adjunct to
estate agencies by catering particularly to people who want to move long
distances.
Until recently, the Property Sales Register in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire,
relied solely on computer matching for results but, like Link-Up, it is now
advertising properties in the national press as well. Its registration fees
range from Pounds 65 for properties worth up to Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100
for those over Pounds 120,000, but it does not charge any commission. People
and properties are matched every two weeks on the database and computer
print-outs are sent to clients.
Director Anthony Muir-Clark says: 'During the course of a year, we have many
many thousands of people going through our hands. We don't guarantee a sale,
but we are able to match people up very successfully.
'We give a refund if we don't match vendors with a prospective buyer. And we
reckon that we refund something less than 2 per cent.'
Each agency has a broad client bank, including people looking for holiday
properties, employees who must re-locate, people looking for retirement
homes or moving to the UK from abroad, and investors and developers.
They try to weed out time-wasters by getting clients to complete fairly
detailed questionnaires and discussing their requirements on the telephone.
Laister believes this is a particularly useful function.
He advertised his Welsh cottage privately as well as registering with the
agency. The response from advertising equalled the number of people sent to
him by Link-Up - but many were not serious buyers.
'I must say that I had as much response from my own private advertising, so
I was a bit disappointed with Link-Up. But the people Link-Up sent me were
all definitely looking for the type of property I was selling, so there
wasn't a question of anybody wasting anybody's time,' he adds.
Muir-Clark believes the system is an attractive option in a market where
profit margins are tight. 'People are beginning to recognise that computer
matching has a value in this situation,' he says.
'For a relatively modest sum, one can add more strings to one's bow, get
buyers nationally - and stand a chance of saving money as well.'

FT  22 OCT 94 / Outdoors: Purpose-built France - or old Austria? - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Val d'Isere's 'criterium de la premiere neige' - the annual celebration
of the opening of the ski season - approaches once again, thousands of
skiers have already been trying to make their time-honoured decision: will
it be France or Austria this year. It is never an easy choice.
Since the Albertville Olympics of 1992, the French have made brave attempts
to abandon the Gallic shrug and dress up some of their architectural
mistakes in gentler cladding. But they still have not got Gemutlichkeit -
the traditional mountain welcome cocktail of yodelling, accordion, tuba,
schnapps and roaring fire - which is a German word much hyped in brochure
copy when referring to Austrian ski resorts. It does not translate readily
into French, to whom such a concept is anathema.
This may perhaps explain why British skiers can easily be divided between
Austrophiles and Francophiles, and why Austria and France are neck-and-neck
in popularity as destination countries of British skiers.
In a perfect world on the mountains, the ski resorts and ski lifts might be
French, the villages Austrian or Swiss, the mountain restaurants Italian and
the resort personnel North American.
The reality is that for 'serious skiers', the French resorts are unbeatable
while skiers who want the best all-round ski holiday experience might be
tempted by Austria, Switzerland, the US or Canada.
French ski resorts have a number of individual characteristics: first they
have the French, who are traditionally viewed as something of a mixed
blessing. On the plus side they have the highest resorts, some of the most
modern ski lifts, and ski-in ski-out accommodation.
Unlike the rest of Europe, France came comparatively late to skiing as a big
tourist attraction, and had the benefit of being able to build such resorts
as Les Arcs, La Plagne, Tignes, Avoriaz and Flaine in optimum locations for
good snow and access.
But this same 'purpose-built' tag was to alienate some skiers used to the
quintessential picturesque Austrian village with onion-domed church and
picture-postcard chalets.
Most Swiss and Austrian ski resorts were based on villages which were
already well-established. In France, only the likes of Chamonix, Val
d'Isere, Megeve and La Clusaz fall into this category.
The other advantage of skiing in France is self-catering, little practised
in the rest of the Alps. Rather than being tied to a fixed Austrian or Swiss
menu, the self-catering skier can enjoy eating out one night and cooking a
meal in the apartment the next. Or any combination of the two during the
holiday.
Self-catering goes hand in hand with driving to the ski area, and doubtless
skiers will be taking advantage of the Channel Tunnel to reach such resorts
as Courchevel, Meribel, Avoriaz and Flaine with plenty of provisions on
board, or stop at a hypermarket on the way there. And they can stop on the
way back and collect a crate or two of wine.
Skiers with cars can also take advantage of the increasing popularity of
multi-resort lift tickets, which allow you to ski, for example in Val
d'Isere and Tignes and spend a day in Les Arcs or La Plagne, and another in
the Trois Vallees.
Skiers who are really offended by the so-called concrete monstrosities that
passed for contemporary architecture in the late 1960s will perhaps be
comforted by the fact that the French realise they created some alpine
carbuncles a quarter of a century ago and are trying to do something about
it.
At Flaine, thought by some to be the ugliest of the purpose-built resorts,
the principal development in the 1990s - Le Hameau (the Hamlet) which is
still being added to - marks a return to traditional alpine architecture,
with the construction of attractive Scandinavian-style chalets and
apartments.
Thirty years after La Plagne's biggest eyesore Aime La Plagne was built, the
resort now has mixed feelings about the architecture. (Bellecote is no
picture-postcard either). They have since compensated for it by reverting to
a more neo-rustic style for some of its more recent developments. These
include Belle Plagne, Plagne Soleil and Plagne Village.
In spite of these much more attractive developments, it is certainly worth
visiting or even staying in the traditional villages of Champagny and
Montalbert just to get a break from La Plagne's brave new world of skiing
automation.
This way you can get the best of both worlds, enjoying a huge network of
good skiing by day, and a pleasantly rustic retreat by night. This works
well at Alpe d'Huez too, where you can retreat to Vaujany or Oz for intimate
evenings, and at Les Deux Alpes, where Venosc provides a little relief from
the boisterous local apres-ski.
But whether you like the quiet life, the frenzied demi-monde of all-night
discotheques and nightclubs, or the hurly-burly of an Austrian folk evening,
the basic skiing product offered by France and Austria will always be worlds
apart, and probably the better for it. There will never be a Saalbach-Entre
Flaine or a Chamonixental.
Perhaps this winter France may edge ahead of Austria in the popularity
stakes. More likely, the Austrians will stay ahead by a yodel. The French
may have the premiere neige, but they may not have the dernier mot when it
comes to luring British skiers from Alpbach to Alpe d'Huez.

Bonjour, said the French Customs official, which came as a surprise as we
were still in Folkestone. But Le Shuttle is full of surprises, whether it is
Nicholas Grimshaw's breathtaking terminal or the sensation of driving your
car along a platform into a train, which then starts without you noticing.
Among a five-car compartment belonging to Eurotunnel shareholders who had
paid Pounds 30 for a return trip - 30 times more than their future
concessions are worth - was Elizabeth Hooninan, taking her second Le Shuttle
trip. Relieved that she had not found it claustrophobic, her only
disappointment was the lack of prestigious shops in the UK terminal.
'People have said to us we should sell our shares,' she said, 'but we
haven't and we won't. We feel that Britain needs a national project and we
bought the shares because we believed in the idea of a great British
venture.'
Jane and David Warren bought their shares in Eurotunnel because he hates
travelling by sea and she loathes flying. 'I'd definitely use it again -
especially as I hate the ferries in winter,' said David.
Seconds after leaving Le Shuttle, you are on the motorway heading towards
Paris, marvelling at the lack of formalities and the ease of the journey.
That is, until you realise you are driving on the wrong side of the road.

FT  22 OCT 94 / How to sweat off the excesses of life: A look at the rigours
of 'the cure' in the Allgau
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is four in the morning and there is a strange woman in my hotel room. I
can make out only a pair of brawny shoulders framed against the light from
the corridor. 'Halli-Halloo]' she says, and whips off my duvet. 'Get up.
Undress and drink this.'
Nettle tea is a noxious brew at the best of times. And this is not the best
of times. Naked, dangling the teabag to protect my modesty, I sip queasily
while the night visitor deconstructs my bed.
'Lie down]' I edge forward into the light, and stretch out prone. The nerve
ends in my backside tell me I am lying in a puddle of lukewarm tripe.
Receptors on my front-side twitch in anticipation. Then, splash] My knees
jerk defensively upwards as I take a direct hit amidships from a cold, wet
sheet.
Within seconds the icy wrapping stretches from my breastbone to my big toes.
Now comes a layer of gelatinous hot water containers, strewn the length of
my quaking torso. I am rolled and wrapped in blankets and feather-beds.
'Footsies up. Armies so.' Loose ends are stuffed. Corners tucked. 'Good]'
Breathing heavily, she is suddenly gone; and I am immobilised in the
darkness, scarcely breathing at all.
A 100kg roly-poly meat pudding, I lie still as death, only my nose showing.
Then, unexpectedly, I am marinating in my own juices. The combination of wet
linen, hot water bottles fore and aft, and heavy external lagging central to
the implementation of the notorious Schrothkur is going to work, putting my
sweat glands through their paces.
In spite of - or maybe because of - years of overdosing on stress and
undesirable substances such as cigarettes and German sausages, I have
cajoled myself into believing that it might be possible to restore some of
the more desirable bodily functions impaired by 30 years as a journalist.
Accordingly, I have come to the sub-Alpine village of Steibis in the Allgau
to regain the ability to breathe, eat and sleep properly. The rest can wait.
Deep in cure-and-cowbell country, close to where the Bavarian, Schwabian,
Austrian and Swiss borders mingle on the shores of Lake Constance, I have
suspended my disbelief in natural remedies and thrown away my cigarettes.
Although the Schrothkur appeals mainly to slimmers, and I am told my 1.85m
frame is not over-burdened by the 99.6kg weight registered on my arrival, I
have decided that while XL T-shirts are fashionable, XL waistbands are for
fatties. At the same time I have convinced myself that if I can survive a
week of early-morning 'packing' and subsist on a diet entirely free of
fripperies such as protein, salt and fat, then I can certainly do without my
Dunhill Superior Milds.
It is only day one, but from within my tightening cocoon, the outlook does
not seem promising.
It is now six in the morning and I am sorry I bothered to unpack my suitcase
last night. Terminal claustrophobia is setting in, and there is an
irritating whiff of old cooking under my itching nose.
Only now, as the enveloping angel returns to unpack my puckered body and
allow me to drift back into sleep, do I realise that my own damp hide is the
source of the kitchen aroma. The promised Entschlackung (slag removal when
used for boilers and purification in bodily references) seems to be under
way. Detoxification and breakfast beckon. But first, I need a snooze.
It is now 9.30 in the breakfast room in Burtscher's Hotel. After straying
into a section where real people are eating real food, I have been
forcefully corralled where I belong, among the sad-sacks and the
gastronomically-deprived.
There, under my nose, sits a dish of weapons-grade muesli. I murmur that
humans need at least two stomachs, ruminant-fashion, if they are to extract
any nourishment from this gritty slurry of coarse-chopped raw grain.
But Frau Wunderlich, some 20 years my senior and 20 times as fit, has been
coming for years and knows better. She even thinks a big strong chap such as
Herr Parkes should have a bigger portion than the one she has just enjoyed.
She is wrong, thank God. The waitress, plump as a Weisswurst, shakes her
head and her Bavarian bustle. Everything is as it should be: small in volume
and lacking in flavour. As the Schrothkur litany says, seasoning arouses
appetites, and you do not need an appetite when you are not supposed to be
eating.
So it continues: lunch, then dinner and back to the breakfast grindstone.
The worst is a dish of sauerkraut soup. Far from being a junipery-peppery
brew covered with globules of floating fat and speckled with chunks of Speck
and sausage, it resembles nothing so much as a pair of undershorts boiled to
destruction in Persil Power.
But meal times are not without their high spots. I still recall triumphantly
counting 17 pumpkin seeds on my plate of lettuce, beet and cabbage salad one
evening.
By day two, bets are being wagered that the solitary Englander is not going
to make it, least of all with the cigarettes. Most have heard he is only
there for a week, when everyone knows three weeks is the minimum necessary.
They have also heard his descriptions of the preparation and consumption of
Irish stew and ceps a la Bordelaise. They have seen him sitting close to
smokers, inhaling deeply.
But what they do not know is that his modest expectations of this adventure
are being more than fulfilled. He is sleeping like a baby. He is enjoying
the morning physical jerks, even though most of the exercises are aimed at
perking up breasts rather than building washboard abdominal muscles.
He is enjoying the companiableness of it all and the pleasures of his
comfortable room. He is astounded by the limitless views afforded from the
nearby peaks and facilitated by relentlessly clear weather. It is
mid-October, and he is sunbathing and swimming outside, soothed by the
clonking of the cowbells.
The smell of old cooking has evaporated from his room and by Wednesday he
has ceased to feel hungry. The sauna and plunge bath are no longer torture.
They are necessary punctuation points in the day's rituals. After a rigorous
afternoon ramble, a three-course sauna session sets him up to face his
one-course supper and an evening's socialising in the bar.
Yes, in the bar.
This is the do-you-good cure where the pain can be eased with analgesic
booze. The drinks are limited to Wacholderschnapps, a diuretic derivative of
lamp-oil and juniper berries, and Steiner white wine, a tongue-peeler
reportedly related to the Riesling grape. But no one seems to care. Even on
the so-called 'dry' days, interspersed between 'little-drink' and
'big-drink' days, Schrothkur sufferers are entitled to two schnapps.
But the one to wait for is Thursday, when it is dance-night and big-drinks
on the house. Anticipatory tensions are building up as early as Tuesday,
when Georg, an outsize hotelier on a busman's holiday is eager to explain.
Cure clients, he says, slugging back his fifth vodka and grapefruit juice,
are easily switched into sexual overdrive. All it takes is a blend of
nil-food, fresh air, Steiner Riesling and a 1970s crooner, preferably the
late Roy Black, singing 'Ganz in weiss'.
Having sat in the sauna with most of our middle-and-more-aged fellow guests
or watched them wrestling with their wobbly bits on the gymnasium floor, I
am not much convinced.
But my other neighbour, Ferdi, is positively slavering. He is a
buckshot-for-brains huntsman. He knows where the chamois graze on the
mountains outside. He can guess the weight and friskiness of a woman from
100m, and checks his estimates using the Bavarian cowherd's method of a
whack on the rump.
But come the fateful soiree, and some of the more excitable gentlemen in the
company are clearly up to their scuppers in Steiner before the ancient DJ is
through his first session. More knees-up than leg-over, big-drinks Thursday
is a noisy, rather than a naughty, affair and signals the start of the
transition from asceticism to more normal existence.
On Friday, those about to depart are allowed a 'build-up' dinner of a trout,
unseasoned, cooked in foil. By Saturday night this departee is down the road
to nearby Oberstaufen in the Enzianhutte restaurant. Starting with a roe
deer fillet with Steinpilzen (boletus edulis), red cabbage, fried gnocchi, a
bottle of 1989 claret, he is chewing his way deliberately towards the
holy-of-holies: dessert
It is 11am on my last day. I have enjoyed my 'build-up' breakfast (but not
as much as last night's afters: pear bread overlaid with gorgonzola and
dribbled with honey). I have taken my last swim and paused to weigh myself
by the pool: 93.3kg wringing wet. That is a good 6kg lost in a week, and I
have not had a cigarette for eight days.
I am still smiling smugly as I step out of the hotel, blinded by the
dazzling autumn sunshine, and almost colliding with an indistinct figure
striding urgently past. 'Halli-Halloo,' she says. I turn, but she has gone
again.
Christopher Parkes stayed at his own expense in Burtscher's Kur und
Sporthotel, 8974 Oberstaufen-Steibis, Germany.

guilty).

FT  22 OCT 94 / All in the Mind: Switched on to pain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who suffers frequently from a bad back - and that includes one in
four Britons, according to a recent study - knows all too well that science
has not been very good at controlling pain. But scientists are catching up.
It has long been believed that pain is the body's alarm signal to prevent
further damage (such as to a finger on a hot stove). But why then do we feel
chronic pain, long after the body could take avoiding action? Recent
research suggests an answer.
The main point is that signals about damage do not always pass straight into
the part of the brain that experiences pain. The signals can be blocked or
amplified by switches in the spinal cord. And signals that have nothing to
do with damage can be switched into the alarm system so that they cause
pain.
Scientists are now trying to understand how to manipulate the switches so
that pain can be controlled.
Acute pain after an external stimulus is still best thought of as a damage
warning. Specialised nerve cells in all parts of the body activated by
stimuli, such as from a cut or a burn, send signals into central pathways of
the brain and nervous system where electrical activity causes the sensation
of pain.
The brain works out where the pain has come from by knowing which part of
the pathway is stimulated.
For example, a knock on the 'funny bone' causes pain over a wide area of the
hand and arm because it strikes the nerve-carrying signals from this area. a
Indeed, one of the cornerstones of neural science is the idea that the
sensations we experience from a particular stimulus may be different,
depending on which pathways in the brain are activated.
This helps to explain some of the puzzles about the damage-warning theory of
pain. For example, why does vigorous rubbing of an injury sometimes relieve
pain, whereas in other circumstances the lightest touch can be agonising?
How can an amputated limb hurt? Why, in chronic pain, does the alarm
continue to ring long after it has served its purpose? The answers come from
research on the switches that block or redirect pain signals.
The first suggestion that pain signals could be blocked from entry into the
spinal cord came in the mid-1960s. It was proposed that they pass through a
sort of gate that can be closed by a circuit activated by other sensory
signals.
There is now much support for the gate theory. Rubbing the skin relieves
pain because it generates sensory signals that activate the circuit that
closes the gate. Acupuncture and electrical stimulation of the skin work in
the same way. Morphine's analgesic effects occur because it mimics a
chemical that closes the gate.
The gate can also be closed by signals descending from higher levels of the
brain, to block pain if we need to act to avoid something even worse.
Wounded soldiers can often disregard injuries until they are out of
immediate danger.
A different set of spinal switches amplifies pain. Prolonged or intense
signals in the damage-sensing neurones have two effects. Central pain
pathways become more sensitive to their normal inputs so that pain is
amplified. They also become sensitive to signals caused by touching or
moving the skin, so that these, too, cause pain, but no damage.
This intensification of prolonged pain has doubtless evolved to immobilise
any part of the body which has become badly injured. So any sensations that
result from a disturbance of the injured part (such as a hand or foot) are
rerouted into the pain pathway, even when a similar movement would not in
other circumstances have caused direct pain. The unfortunate consequence is
that chronic pain conditions, for example from inflamed nerves, are made
worse.
The pains that may be experienced in an amputated limb and by patients whose
spinal cord has been severed (paraplegics) probably also owe much to this
mechanism
For even when a limb has been amputated its pain pathway in the central
nervous system remains and can be activated.
Paraplegics usually lose all sensation below their spinal injury, but they
may be left with severe pain. In some cases the spinal pathway carrying pain
signals may be intact and other sensory signals may be channelled into it.
Scientists do not yet understand the details of the mechanism of central
sensitisation, but it is the focus of important research in universities and
in the pharmaceuticals industry.
A drug to reverse its effects - still many years away - would lighten
thousands of lives darkened by chronic pain.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Monuments for the millennium: We asked readers how Britain
should celebrate. Antony Thorncroft received hundreds of ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Millennium Commission is seeking your ideas on how the nation can best
celebrate the end of the second millennium. The Government has set aside a
fifth of the proceeds from the national lottery - a possible Pounds 1.6bn -
to ensure the party will be worth remembering. We asked our readers to help
out the commission with suggestions.
We obviously touched a nerve - the response was tremendous, producing
hundreds of ideas. Many shared the same vision: that the money should be
devoted to nature - to more parks, trees, flowers along every highway, the
greening of the land.
Many had a more 21st-century vision, pushing for information highways,
science parks, a computer terminal for every home.
Many more wanted the money to go, not on buildings or objects, but to the
poor, in improving health care and housing estates, a view summed up by
Cessna Vaz who suggested a ticker-tape extravaganza, pouring money down on
the needy.
There was an enthusiastic lobby for a national virtual-reality centre (Sam
Briddes suggested the old Paddington goods yard as the site) to which the
whole nation could tune with their Millennium computers. Peter Howe even
suggested a virtual-reality monarch to take the strain off the Queen.
Past national celebrations have focused on buildings - the Crystal Palace in
1851, the Festival Hall a century later - but, apart from the brave idea of
a North Sea Tunnel linking eastern England to Scandinavia, there was no
great support for a 2001 monument.
+++++++ End of Leg 2 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Among the ideas were a gigantic national museum built of titanium ; a
matching obelisk for Cleopatra's Needle; a rocket-shaped skyscraper topped
with telescopes; and, on a humbler plane, Lt Col Colin McVean produced very
specific plans for a sundial which could be attached to existing structures
like Nelson's Column, or to village maypoles, allowing the nation to keep
time during the Third Millennium.
Some suggestions seemed rather self-serving - King's Jazz Review wanted a
traditional jazz Jazzitoria; others were universal, like RS Osmaston who
wanted every 18-year-old in 2000 to be given Pounds 1,000 if they had no
criminal record.
There were the idiosyncratic - like Andrew Seed's plea for a vast gambling
centre, a British Las Vegas sited near Manchester; plans to build a new town
that looked exactly like Elizabethan London; to dismantle hydroelectric dams
in Scotland to restore beauty to the Highlands; or allocate a Scottish
island, perhaps Arran, for the Chinese wanting to leave Hong Kong in 1996.
There was a big transport lobby, wanting cycle lanes traversing the land;
off-street parking for every vehicle; free cycles for all; bullet trains; a
Peace Ship 2000, with concert areas and exhibition space; and 2,000 barges
sailing down the Thames. It was only matched by advocates of more national
parks; lungs for cities; and banning cars.
There were supporters for exploiting the potential in hydrogen; advocates
for harnessing tidal power; for making more use of water, from the ocean
resources to reclaiming deserts. There were those who wanted a university
for the 50-plus generation and many suggestions for a grand new national
museum, perhaps a 21st-century Crystal Palace, reflecting the past but also
looking towards the future, forming the greatest scientific resource centre
in the world, or, in the words of William MacKay a 'World Millennium
University'.
For the winners I was divided by the most imaginative ideas and the most
comprehensive lists of sensible suggestions. Among the latter, John Clink
supplied 15 including such novelties as a Peace Prize for Britons and a
British attempt to capture every Guinness record; TP Butler costed a range
of ideas and came up with the wheeze of investing much of the Millennium
Fund in the stock markets and real estate of Asia so that the revenues last
for ever; while N. May was practical, with free calls to one specific number
(to a son or daugher) for over 60s; free electricity in 2000; and a birthday
present of a block of Premium Bonds for everyone, not cashable for three
years.
Among the imaginative ideas Tony Sanderson of Oxford thought big. He wanted
to recover much of the North Sea and the Wash, thus extending the land of
the nation. He also envisaged a mountain range on the Welsh borders and
ideal for skiing and walking. It would give the Midlands warmer summers. The
bulk would come from the waste of industrial cities.
But the winner is Darren Ross of Sunderland who envisages 2000 stone
monuments erected around the coastline of Britain. Not amazing in itself but
Mr Ross imagines a carving on every stone, a poem, a legend, a picture,
telling the visitor about the locality. Each stone could contain sundials,
compasses, maps, optical illusions. It could have a transmitter sending out
a poem, a song, a description. The stones should be of human height and
imaginatively carved. And at the height of the Millennial celebrations a
laser could link every stone, encasing the nation in a uniting thread of
light. It is imaginative, practical, and charming, and well worth a crate of
champagne.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Fashion: Suits are serious this season - Avril Groom has
been combing the catwalks and the high street for plain and simple clothes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A woman who went into German designer Jil Sander's new concession at Harrods
recently bought seven suits. Perhaps she needed one for each day of the
week, such is the pull of the serious suit on the modern woman.
It is the same story at the Sander shop which Browns has opened in South
Molton Street, W1. Amid the cool marble and glass, suits are sought after.
They cost Pounds 1,200 on average, their popularity reflecting their
importance in a well-planned wardrobe.
This season it should be your main buy. On almost every catwalk at the
autumn shows, behind the unwearable razzmatazz, was a suit which could rise
to any occasion. The jacket, leanly-cut or flared out from a neat waist, was
long enough to act as a coat over the new short, A-line skirt.
The majority had matching trousers, slim enough to go with new-glamour high
heels and to look smooth with an A-line tunic.
Sander's suits are plain to the point of severity, made from the finest of
drapable wool, cut with shoulders that are defined yet soft, and shaped with
gently arching seams that flatter but never constrict.
Feminine authority is a good description for fashion's U-turn towards a
dressed-up but still soft look. A good investment, they are impressively
minimal when worn alone but can form the ideal foil for a new season's
accessories.
Such plain suits profit from a little wit and whimsy. One lesson from the
muddled fashion of the 1990s is that individuality pays. The minimal-suit
clone is as boring as the gilt-button clone. So use your suit as background
material, making it your own with imaginative accessories - the mini-bags,
jewel-bright angoras and ankle-strapped high-heeled shoes that create a tone
of light-hearted glamour.
This is where the high street comes in. From designer diffusion ranges to
department stores and chains, mass market fashion now reacts so quickly in
interpreting catwalk ideas, and has improved its quality so much, that there
is little point in buying the expensive original of a one-season wonder.
There are just two areas this autumn where one might advise caution. A-line
skirts from youth-market chains are very short so you might prefer more
sophisticated sources. And the new influx of bright or metallic colour can
be very garish at the cheaper end.
Nevertheless the high street is well worth searching; Oasis fringed scarves
cost under Pounds 15 and French Connection's soft and dusky velvet A-line
tunic is Pounds 89. At Whistles' (strictly speaking more of a chic boutique
chain) there is a silk satin shirt in a particularly luscious muted pink,
redolent of 1930s glamour, at Pounds 110.
The main suit is one item where the rule of thumb is to buy the best you can
afford - it will make those high street accessories look classier. There are
good, plain suits at all levels. When clothes are shorn of detail, cut and
finish become paramount and need close examination before you buy. Dorothy
Perkins' newly revamped range, Jigsaw and Marks and Spencer easily pass the
quality test for young women on a budget.
With middle-range suits costing about Pounds 400 each, it is worthwhile, if
you can, going up a notch to a level where excellence of cut and finish,
plus proper design input, are taken for granted. It may seem a lot to pay
Pounds 600-Pounds 800 but designers are well aware that their customers want
lasting value. Rightly, you get more cut and less detail for your money.
Choose a dark, plain colour for maximum mileage. Black is obvious but less
versatile for a suit which must presumably go from day to night and town to
country. Charcoal, navy or deep taupe are better choices. Pinstripes are
hot, but think before you buy - will you still want them next year?
We have listed the best suits, all beautiful, versatile and useful in the
long term. The Alberta Ferretti style photographed here has all the
qualities of contemporary glamour - soft, matt fabric, a slim-waisted,
flattering shape and a chameleon ability to go with this season's
essentials.
Sketched here are just some of the clothes that will give your suit the
extra mileage to take it through the winter.

FT  22 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: The ring cycle - A commitment that matters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rite of the engagement ring, I discovered when doing a bit of research a
few weeks back, lives on - in the UK at least. In Britain, 96 per cent of
men buy their brides-to-be an engagement ring. And very nice, too.
But these days, if statistics are to be believed, marriage is not what it
used to be and a 'relationship' has become the new institution. For any
jeweller worth his chisel these changing times represent a challenge.
So it had to happen - what we have now is the commitment ring. No longer is
there any excuse for a chap to be stingy with the jewels - the commitment
ring is what he can give to her when he is chary of stepping down the aisle.
Hennell of Bond Street, one of London's oldest fine jewellers, has decided
to bring itself up to date and this week launches its new, streamlined,
1990s version of the old-style engagement ring.
Designed by Dennis Gardner, Hennell's head of design, it is simple in the
extreme - in pure gold or platinum the ring is not quite closed, leaving a
symbolic gap. One of the open ends of the ring is finished with a brilliant
diamond, the ring comes engraved with two sets of initials and, for those
who like jewellery to match, there is a bracelet which is simply the
open-ended ring made larger.
The rings start at Pounds 750 (for a diamond the size of a tenth of a carat,
prices go up as the diamond gets larger and a sized-up ring with a
half-carat diamond for instance would cost Pounds 3,800).
The commitment bangles start at Pounds 2,200 and also go up as the diamonds
get larger.
Hennell is at 12 New Bond Street, London W1Y 1HE.

FT  22 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: Making up is so very hard to do - How a
skilful artist can transform your appearance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you are by nature shy and retiring, if you feel at home with the refined
no-make-up-look faces of the Armani or Calvin Klein woman, prepare for a
tough season.
All those pale skins, non-descript beiges and all that exquisite
tastefulness, are being replaced by something much more alarming - up-front
reds, look-at-me fuchsias, smouldering eyes and aggressively manicured
nails.
There is a brashness, a feistiness abroad. That at least is the message
peddled by designers, make-up artists and models but, as with most such
messages, it is first aired in an extreme and exaggerated form. After all,
if it was not, would anyone take any notice?
For those who live in the real world, and have to get by without top-model
Nadja Auermann's platinum hair, dangerous eyes and towering body, adopting
this look wholesale would probably be unwise but, nevertheless, there has
been a mood-change and there are ways of reflecting it without looking . . .
well, daft.
If you want to know how, there are few cleverer exponents of the art of
making-up than leading make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin. In a book to be
published shortly he takes us on a trip through the world of gloss and
foundation, powders and potions, brushes and blushers.
The photography is beautiful and wonderfully explanatory. The end result may
look like alchemy but Kevyn Aucoin gives us the nitty-gritty details. There,
for instance, is Kate Moss, the role-model of waifdom and grunge, newly done
over in 1990s' glamour.
There, too, is model Patti Hansen, made-up to show us how one face can
project a powerfully different image by using different colour combinations:
pale, luminous with light eyes and mouth; then chicly dramatic with a
slicked-back bob, light eyes and vermilion mouth; 'European-style' glam, all
dark mouth and dark eyes; finally, we have her in what he calls the most
sophisticated mood - dark eyes and light mouth. All these looks - he swears
 -are created with minimal changes so that a fresh, light look for daytime
can be easily and quickly intensified for evening.
To show the chameleon-like ability of hair and make-up to project powerfully
different images, he presents a fascinating selection of make-overs - these
are the favourite stuff of magazine picture editors, for the photographs are
convincing evidence that almost all who want to look good these days can
look good. But Aucoin himself approaches make-overs with diffidence. 'When I
think of make-overs, I think of those awful 'before' pictures in which the
woman is captured sitting under a fluorescent light with no make-up on, her
hair frizzed out, wearing the expression of someone who has just been told
something terrible. Who wouldn't look better in the 'after' shot?'
Nevertheless, I defy any woman to look at the 'befores' and the 'afters' and
not be encouraged - fairly ordinary-looking women have been transformed by
skilful make-up, good hair-cuts and marvellous photography.
Although Aucoin is informative on all the techniques of making-up he is,
perforce, short on giving details of products.
I therefore asked Val Garland, a British make-up artist working in the
fashion field, to give us some tips of her own.
Colour, she says, is the make-up statement of the season - and the hottest
colour to grace lips and nails is red. But bright, brilliant red, she warns,
may do wonders for Paloma Picasso but does not suit every skin-tone. 'There
are other ways of using red,' she says, 'than just one brilliant slash of
colour. Many of the cosmetic companies have produced soft red stains - Mac
(only available at Harvey Nichols) and Clinique for instance. If you have a
dark red that you find too strong you can dilute it with some of Keihls
lip-balm for a softer look. You can apply a real red to the centre of your
lips and blend it out to the edges with a lip brush or cotton bud for a more
subtle look.
'Those going for the really bold approach should use a lip-liner to form a
perfect lip outline (Mac has a true red pencil). This will help prevent the
colour bleeding. Then the chosen red should be applied with a lip brush, it
should be blotted with a tissue and then reapplied. This way your lipstick
should stay put.
'At night you may want a stronger red - Helmut Newton-style. After you have
applied the lipstick as outlined earlier you should then put some lip gloss
in the middle only of the lips (if you put it near the edges it will
smudge).'
Her favourite reds for this season are found at Mac, Prescriptives (by
Clinique), Paloma Picasso, Chanel (Rouge Coromandel for those who like it
bright, Rouge Star for a subtler look) and Yves Saint Laurent.
The Art of Make-up by Kevyn Aucoin, (Prion, Pounds 40, 175 pages) is
available from November 1. On Tuesday, November 8, he will be demonstrating
his skills and signing books at Harrods, Knightsbridge, London SW1 from 12
to 2pm.

FT  22 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: The cult spreads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Muji, for many who are within reach of one of its four branches in the UK,
has become a cult shop. It arrived with a formidable reputation from Japan
where, in that land of widespread devotion to the designer label, it had
managed to build itself into a chain of 221 shops all purveying the notion
that a 'look-no-label' (which is what Muji means) range had a chic all its
own.
Of course timing is all and Muji's arrival coincided with the mood for a
simpler, more pared-down approach to living. It became a hit with the young
who loved the fact that it concentrated on needs and seemed to have no
interest in creating wants, that it provided them with the basic essentials
for homes and bedsits and that, above all, simple was not a euphemism for
cheap.
Having found that its shops in London's Great Marlborough Street, Covent
Garden and Glasgow have made a niche for themselves, Muji is now trying to
reach a wider public. This week it opens in Kensington High Street, south
London, where it is going to have to compete with the offerings of some of
the most successful chains - from BhS and Marks and Spencer to Warehouse and
C &amp; A.
To do this Muji has been carefully redefining its ranges over the last 18
months.
The strong yen had made many of its products, innately desirable though they
were, seem expensive by the time they reached the UK. Muji has therefore
been looking at sourcing many of the ranges outside Japan and prices are now
much keener. Bed-linen, which used to come in sizes that did not conform to
British beds, is now being sourced in Europe and will fit European beds.
Clothes are being sized up to new LL and XL sizes to cope with larger
western bodies. Muji's underwear range is already well established (it is
very popular with my own children). Cult items include stationery and
snack-foods. In the Glasgow branch foods such as dried shrimps, seaweed,
chocolate pretzels and butter cookies are among the best-sellers.
The new store opens at 157 Kensington High Street, London W8 today and there
is plenty of new merchandise. Its mail order brochure will be available from
the shop or by ringing 071-494 1197.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Arts: Measured to not very good effect - The RSC's latest
Measure for Measure at Stratford is somewhat disappointing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The more I see Measure for Measure, the more remarkable a play it appears.
It enquires, as acutely as anything Shakespeare ever wrote, into the nexus
of morality, justice, sex, governance and life. And it achieves its drama by
putting life in the scales with life, sin with sin, ruler with ruler, lover
with lover. And this sense of balancing like with like enters into its very
language: 'Grace is grace,' 'blood, thou art blood,' 'truth is truth.'
Three hair-raising scenes bring their dilemmas in the play to its height:
two between the postulant nun Isabella and the deputy ruler Angelo (Act 2,
Scenes 2 and 4) in which her innocent pleas on behalf of her sentenced
brother Claudio impress, then seduce, Angelo, and in which he then asks her
to sacrifice her chastity to gain her brother's life; and one between
Isabella and Claudio, in which she tells him to die, rather than ask her to
yield her chastity to Angelo.
But, once these scenes are over (90 minutes into the three hour play), then
either the plot sags (since the Duke tells us at once what is going to
happen) or it rises, as the Duke brings it to its resolution. For the latter
course to occur, it needs an actor who sees that the Duke, as Escalus says,
'above all other strifes, contended especially to know himself.'
Not so in Steven Pimlott's new production for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
Here the Duke is Michael Feast, who gives much the same atrocious
performance as he delivered as Becket in Pimlott's 1993-94 RSC staging of
Murder in the Cathedral; and this time his cadaverous resemblance to the
Grim Reaper is absolute. Everything here is insincere, over-emphatic, fake
lower middle-class, and melodramatic. There is no quest for self-knowledge,
none of the ironic Shakespearian sense of a ruler who abdicates to find out
more about ruling, and zero generosity to his fellow-actors. He is all
contrivance, especially when feigning to be relaxed.
Elsewhere, things are better. Pimlott knows how to tell the story clearly,
and he emphasises the exceptionally urban character of this play. But, as in
Feast's performance, the production tends to be, on the one hand,
melodramatic and, on the other, schematic. 'Effects' abound. Stella Gonet's
Isabella, who has a fine basic blend of spontaneity and zeal, screams
several times too often; Alex Jennings' Angelo, as 'precise' and 'severe' as
others describe him, has analysed his soliloquies until they fall apart
before our very ears.
Both Gonet and Jennings are cast against the grain: which I applaud. To have
Gonet this chaste and Jennings this humourless is not yet persuasive, but it
may bring rich harvests in the time to come. Toby Stephens is, for once, a
Claudio cast from strength (just watch him listen to the Duke); and Barry
Lynch's Lucio has a relaxed ease making his every scene refreshing.
Some of the best performances are in smaller roles - notably Monica Dolan's
plaintive, unhappy Juliet and Bille Brown's bewildered, silly Elbow.
Designer, Ashley Martin-Davies places the action somewhere not very
precisely in the 20th century and puts the Duke's throne on one side and, on
the other, the electric chair. Geddit?
If you need to see Measure for Measure, this production does not actually
get in the play's way. There have, however, been three excellent stagings in
recent years - Nicholas Hytner's (1987) and Trevor Nunn's (1991), both for
the RSC, and Declan Donnellan's this year - which this in no respect
approaches.
In repertory at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Arts: Early works of a genius - William Packer on
Michelanglo at the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Gallery's admirable series of study exhibitions, Making &amp;
Meaning, focussing on particular works in terms both of the artist's
intentions and techniques, continues with a look at the early career of
Michelangelo. The period in question is the very end of the 15th century and
Michelangelo's first extended working visit to Rome.
He arrived from Florence in 1496, aged 21 yet already free from his early
apprenticeship in the studio of the brothers Ghirlandaio, Domenico and
David. His five-year stay was to see not only the confirmation of his
stylistic independence as a painter, but an astonishing burst of activity as
a sculptor and a sequence of masterpieces - the Bruges 'Madonna and Child',
the Rome 'Pieta', the 'Taddei Tondo' from Florence and the 'Pitti Tondo'
from the Royal Academy, all represented here in casts of the highest quality
 -that established him at once as an artist of the first rank and the
fullest maturity.
Sculpture took him back to Florence in 1501, to carve the monumental
'David', and it was sculpture that had brought him to Rome in the first
place. Having been advised to pass off a carved 'Sleeping Cupid' as an
antique, he learned that his Roman dealer had cheated him and so set out to
claim it back. He failed, and the 'Cupid' ended up in the hands of Isabella
d'Este at Mantua, along with a genuine antique of the same subject. It has
long since been lost, passing perhaps into the collections of Charles I and
destroyed in the Whitehall fire of 1698. Who knows? Two such similarly
exquisite 'cupids' are in this exhibition, one a Roman fountain-head of the
2nd century, from the Uffizi, the other a 16th century pastiche from Corsham
Court.
It is tempting but over-fanciful, no doubt, to take this last for the lost
Michelangelo. What is certain is that questions of false attribution and
dissimulation hung about him even at the very outset of his career. Small
wonder then that they do so still. The paintings, rarer than the sculpture,
have always been the more problematical. Only three panels are known from
Michelangelo's early career, of which the Uffizi's 'Doni Tondo' of the Holy
Family, tentatively dated about 1504, is the only one complete and
undisputed.
The other two, both of them unfinished, are in the National Gallery's own
collections. The earlier of them, from around 1497 and painted in egg
tempera, is known as 'the Manchester Madonna' and clearly carries with it,
if not the mark, at least the influence of Ghirlandaio. That is not to say
that it is not entirely authentic to Michelangelo. The easy, graceful
naturalism of the Virgin's gesture is alone enough to affirm the presence of
a younger hand and a fresher eye, to say nothing of the simple, sculptural
monumentality of the composition as a whole. The comparisons in detail with
the sculpture are conclusive. That has not stopped certain scholars from
proposing the existence of a corpus of work by a shadowy 'Master of the
Manchester Madonna'. This theory is immediately scotched, however, by direct
comparison with an example from Vienna of this putative master. There is no
comparison.
But it is the mysterious 'Entombment', dated about 1500 to fix it to a known
commission for an altarpiece for Sant'Agostino and painted in oil, which is
the greater puzzle. A drawing from the Louvre of a kneeling nude is
supposedly a study for the figure of Mary at the lower left of the
composition. A lone scholar has suggested it is not by Michelangelo at all,
and he has a point. For while this study is close enough in spirit, it
displays an openness and almost awkward linearity in its working that is not
quite up to the denser and more fluid modelling of Michelangelo.
But does a single dodgy drawing call into question the authenticity of the
entire painting? Was a drawing by someone else never useful to an artist? Do
inconsistencies in the handling and the drawing suggest anything more than
that one artist accepted help from another? Does lack of documentary
reference to a work, that was clearly full of formal problems and no less
clearly left off abruptly, necessarily require its removal from the canon?
Such arguments do seem so often to be put forward in a spirit of all or
nothing, when the probable reality was something altogether more practical
and mundane. Paintings take time, ideas shift and change, things go wrong.
My own view is that 'the Entombment' is a magnificent failure in a time when
the sculpture was going from spectacular to glorious success. It was not to
be until the Sistine paintings of only a few years later that Michelangelo
would be able finally to resolve, in terms of painting, the easy yet
monumental naturalism that he had already achieved in such sculptural
marvels as the 'Pieta'. The comparisons passim, between the paintings, the
sculpture and the ceilings soon to come, effectively make the point.

Square WC2, until January 15. In association with Esso UK.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Arts: When artistic patronage proves a good investment - A
look at the beneficial relationship between arts and sponsors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past year arts sponsorship has proved itself an industry with
stamina. After two decades of steady growth, with business support for the
arts expanding from around Pounds 1m a year to Pounds 64.4m in 1992-93,
there was a slump, with the recession taking its toll and cutting
expenditure by 13 per cent to Pounds 57.7m.
But in the last 12 months the industry has stabilised, at around the same
sum. Indeed so many new sponsors are applying for the Pounds 4.8m a year
available in government matching money under the Business Sponsorship
Incentive Scheme, that the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts,
which runs the BSIS, has been forced to cut the top-ups by around 40 per
cent, to the consternation of many arts companies and their would be
sponsors.
Companies are now much more hard-headed about their sponsorship
expenditures: they want to see results. There is little inclination to throw
Pounds 100,000 at an event and hope for the best. This applies across all
the main reasons for arts sponsorship - to support an event which offers
entertainment for existing and prospective clients, influential contacts and
opinion formers; to use the arts as part of a marketing and PR strategy, and
to give something back to the community, viewing the arts as an element in
the charity budget.
It is usually too expensive to evaluate the effects of arts sponsorship
(although one new sponsor, Clerical &amp; Medical, has done so to its own
satisfaction) but there is much less money wasted these days. Take one of
the biggest new sponsorships of the year, Allied Domecq's Pounds 3.3m
support, over three years, for the Royal Shakespeare Company.
The company's arm might originally have been twisted by the Prince of Wales,
but the link gives it access to a prestigious national company that tours
abroad - useful as Allied-Domecq goes ever more international. It offers
opportunities for entertaining both in London, at Stratford-on-Avon near its
Midlands base, and throughout the country. It provides an educational
project, which serves the company's charitable needs. It offers RSC
privileges to its workforce. And it acts directly on its customers by adding
promotions for visiting the RSC to its brands. On November 6 the RSC will be
performing a Shakespeare revue at the opening of the CBI Conference in
Birmingham. This is good for the prestige of Allied Domecq and allows the
RSC to play before an influential audience.
The two biggest sponsors in the UK, BT and Lloyds Bank, (with BT just ahead
with a Pounds 1.8m a year spend) reveal two contrasting approaches. BT
concentrates on the community. Its main commitments support drama and music
at the amateur level. It also encourages young people to get involved in the
arts and this year commissioned a new work by composer James Macmillan to be
performed by 12 leading orchestras.
Lloyds Bank, with its support for music, film and fashion, concentrates on
art forms appealing to the young, possibly potential customers. Ideally it
looks for massive television coverage of its events, most notably the Young
Musician of the Year competition, organised with the BBC.
While hospitality is still important (the Pounds 26m raised by Glyndebourne
from companies towards the Pounds 33m cost of its new auditorium proves
that) this is increasingly seen as part of the general corporate hospitality
budget. Arts sponsorship is concentrated either specifically for marketing,
or for goodwill.
Among the most effective marketing campaigns has been Beck's Beer, which
concentrates on young people by supporting avant-garde visual arts events.
Its latest has been backing the German conceptualist Rebecca Horn's shows at
the Tate and the Serpentine. Once again a special production run was
produced, with a work by the artist decorating the bottle.
On a more altruistic level, Manchester Airport has become the major sponsor
of the arts in the north of England, investing over Pounds 1.5m on such
local companies as the Halle Orchestra, the Tate at Liverpool, the Royal
Exchange Manchester and the Manchester Year of Drama. Here is a good example
of self-interested patronage, helping the arts but also raising Manchester's
profile as a travel destination.
The most encouraging features of the year have been the return of
traditional sponsors which held back during the recession, like Nat West
with its new art prize, and the penetration of the message into the regions
and down towards medium sized and small companies. Indeed the London based
companies are finding it hard to maintain their sponsorship income.
The fastest growth has been in the north, with the Halifax Building Society
and Boddingtons, the brewers, prominent new sponsors, while it is the
professions, notably solicitors, surveyors, and especially accountancy
practices, that have proved useful friends for many local arts
organisations.
One of the most satisfied accountancy sponsors of 1994 was Ernst &amp; Young,
which put Pounds 500,000 behind the Picasso exhibition at the Tate. The
publicity and entertainment spin offs exceeded its expectations and it is
quickly returning to the Tate, backing a Cezanne show there.
There is more imaginative arts sponsorship than ever before. Companies are
more inclined to offer help in kind; they are also loaning specialist staff
 -accountants, computer experts, etc - to arts organisations under schemes
like Business in the Arts; there is more interest in sponsoring the
adventurous (like Michelob's support for fringe theatre and Toshiba's Pounds
500,000 help for the ICA), or commissioning new music, new drama, new art
(although the New Contemporaries travelling art show desperately needs a
sponsor following BT's withdrawal).
It remains true that many arts directors spend time chasing up sponsors
which could be more fruitfully directed at creative work, but there have
been no indications that sponsors have ever tried to determine the artistic
programme. The relationship over the past two decades has been largely
beneficial - opening up the eyes of business to the imagination of the arts,
and teaching the arts something about commercial reality.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Arts: Will the gods have the last laugh? - Nicholas Payne,
director of opera at Covent Garden, defends the company's new 'Ring'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS PAYNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An old mate from my university days, still shaken from the previous night's
Rhinegold, admonished me before the start of Walkure: 'Nicky you really
should have stopped it. You know that, don't you?'. The next day I received
a card from another acquaintance: 'It was a really wonderful and such an
intelligent production of Rhinegold - the first serious thing of its sort in
England. If the critics throw rotten oranges, don't despair - carry on. I
can't wait for the next episodes.'
Opera inflames passions, and Wagner's operas more than most. The Royal Opera
House's new Ring has polarised opinion more than usual.
Why do we do it? Would it not be easier to revive an old production, or to
commission something from well-established practitioners who might be relied
upon to produce a more predictably acceptable result? Maybe. I have no
interest in controversy for its own sake. Productions which set out to shock
now bore me. Yet I suspect that there is something intrinsically disturbing
at the bottom of Wagner's Rhine, and that any attempt to dive below the
rippling surface and to dredge it up will upset people.
Our new-look Wagner, which began last year with Meistersinger, is borne of
my conviction that the record of Wagner staging in this country is a fairly
dismal one. I heard my first Walkure at Covent Garden in 1958, memorably
conducted by Rudolf Kempe.
Many magnificent, and some less magnificent, musical experiences have
followed with Rings in this country conducted by Kempe, Konwitschny, Solti,
Downes, Gibson, Davis, Goodall, Mackerras, Armstrong and Haitink, but to a
greater rather than lesser extent the productions which accompanied them
were unworthy.
For intellectual and visual stimulation one had to travel abroad. The
supreme imaginative responses to the Ring have been Wieland Wagner's last
attempt in 1965 and Patrice Chereau's centennial productions begun in 1976,
both at Bayreuth. Both productions were much derided when they first
appeared.
A storm of booing and some hostile reviews do not automatically signal a
good production, although at least they indicate that our wonderfully quiet
audience is alive. But, as the abuse rained down at the opening night
curtain calls on our brave production team, I remained convinced that they
had created something truly remarkable - a contemporary response to Wagner's
Ring which can stand alongside Wieland Wagner's and Chereau's in their day.
Richard Jones and Nigel Lowery, our director and designer, have devised a
Ring unencumbered by tradition. Drawing on a kaleidoscope of references and
images, they have yet fashioned something which is both original and wholly
theirs. Its overt theatricality is refined into a narrative directly told.
Jones asked us to print in the programme Hans Sach's 'Wahnmonolog', his dark
night of the soul before Midsummer's Day. In Meistersinger, 'Wahn', or
madness or folly, is succeeded by healing, the community restored to itself.
In the Ring, Man's folly, his vain pursuit of riches and power and love,
leads to death and destruction and disillusion.
The story is clearly but diversely told. This Rheingold is often funny and
irreverent, its texture deliberately light and transparent rather than
portentous of the tragedy to come. We begin in Arcadia or the Garden of
Eden. Despite the crimes committed the gods are still 'laughing children' at
the end. Only Freia, goddess of youth and beauty, is forgotten and the Rhine
despoiled.
The light-hearted mood has gone by Walkure, which by contrast is introverted
and intense, a symphony in blue. Such humour as remains is cruel and bitter.
The final scene between Wotan and Brunnhilde is enacted on a small square
centre stage, father and daughter driven to hurt each other terribly because
of their great love, trapped in an end-game of hope and despair. I find
these ambiguities very Wagnerian.
Bernard Haitink and I agonised for a long time over the commitment to a new
Ring. We chose Jones and Lowery in preference to five or six other
possibilities because we believed that deep down they had a truly Wagnerian
vision - despite the dangers and unconventionality, or perhaps because of
them.
There are other Wagner operas which I would not ask Jones and Lowery to
stage, despite their fine Flying Dutchman in Amsterdam. We chose Graham Vick
and Richard Hudson for Meistersinger, because we thought they would create
its community and realise the renewal that comes out of anger and loss. I
hope Vick will return for a Parsifal with Haitink at the end of the decade.
For Tristan we are still searching for the right team.
The Royal Opera's policy (pompous word for something which is really a
matter of feel) is to offer diverse and contrasted theatrical experiences
across the whole repertory. Unlike the pope, I cannot claim infallibility.
Our collective judgments may be subject to error, but I can claim that they
are not lightly reached. Long hours of listening, watching, thought and
discussion go into the choice of singers, conductors and directors to blend
into a team which just might capture that elusive phenomenon, the perfect
opera performance, or (to be more realistic) the opera season which on
balance may be judged a success.
It is not an accident that the start of our new Ring is followed by Gounod's
Romeo et Juliette.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Books: Woman at odds with her nature - Out of conflict,
Doris Lessing has produced literature of the highest rank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN CARTWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER MY SKIN: VOLUME ONE OF MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY by Doris Lessing HarperCollins
Pounds 20, 419 pages
This volume covers the years 1919 until 1949, the formative years. It is a
fascinating account of how Doris Lessing first wrestled with and then
escaped colonial life on the family farm and in Salisbury. Her very earliest
memories are of questioning virtually every aspect of received wisdom.
She was that phenomenon, like Katherine Mansfield and Olive Schreiner, and
perhaps Germaine Greer, a woman who throve on her clear-cut duty to defy
provincial society.
There is a rather moving passage in her recent and rambling African Laughter
where Lessing meets her brother at his farm and discovers that his memory of
old times is very different from hers. He is still puzzled, without wishing
to give offence, by the course of her life.
No doubt this incident will appear in Vol. II, but it seems to be the
central question of this volume. While on one level appearing to be the
bright, cheerful, 'Tigger' Tayler, the daughter of an invalid, failing
farmer and a hyperactive former matron at the Royal Free hospital, how and
why did she harbour both loathing for her mother and a belief in her
destiny, which was some thousands of miles away from Salisbury?
The detestation of her mother is on a par with John Osborne's, yet her
mother seems to be a more or less standard colonial, with all the prejudices
and many of the virtues. Her father, with his detestation of the military
(understandable as he lost a leg in the first world war), is more complex,
and never fully understood or explained.
In the realm of human relations, Doris Lessing appears to have been
singularly inept. Her lack of understanding is perhaps a result of her early
solitude and extensive reading. As she demonstrated in African Laughter, the
beliefs of her youth lie in ruins around her. Communism, which she renounced
in 1954, proved an illusion; belief in a post-war renaissance of rationalism
was shattered; the hope of a post-colonial flowering of Africa has proved
equally illusory.
But the habits of mind have not entirely died. Although she has satirised
the colonial left, she says that her own sense of guilt about abandoning
communism persisted into the 1960.
But the reader will be most intrigued to understand how, after her first
marriage, she was able to abandon young children and live in another part of
Salisbury, marry a communist she did not love and have a third child. She
seems unable to explain this most human of dilemmas, beyond the feeling that
she had to escape from her upbringing to follow the demands of her destiny.
Her destiny demanded that she should never be trapped. It also demanded
respect for dreams. Bouncy, chubby, Tigger Tayler has never forgiven those
who underestimated her.
Out of this tension she has built a wonderful career as a writer. There are
in this volume many insights into the material and the inspiration for her
work. There is also a sort of cloudy imprecision about her thoughts,
particularly on the psychological and political levels, which make this at
times a very unsatisfactory biography.
Strange, though, that these musings are invariably illuminated by some
shafts of understanding, as when she says: 'We should be careful of the
company we keep and the language we use. Regimes, whole countries, have been
taken over by language spreading like a virus from minds whose substance is
hatred and envy. When torturers teach apprentices their trade, they learn
from an ugly lexicon.' She should know: in her early days in Southern
Rhodesia, she was completely besotted by the language of communism: she even
doubts she would have resisted if she had been sent out to kill the kulaks.
What you have, then, is the biography of a very complex woman, a woman at
odds with her own nature, her own family, and the society in which she was
born. In the most fundamental way, in her determination to forge her own
life, she is the archetype of contemporary woman; but she is not a feminist,
if that means believing women are victims of men's exploitation. Sometimes
in her retelling of her loves and political preoccupations she suggests a
loneliness which none of the defiant protestations of 'I will not' can
disguise.
As I read on, I desperately wanted to know if she missed her children and
what had become of her daughter, Jean, by her first marriage. Her son John,
we learn casually, has died of a heart attack, 'not unexpectedly' in view of
the Rhodesian life style. Yet it is the miracle of art that out of the
turbulence and conflict - and probably heartbreak of these years she
produced literature of close to the highest rank.
As the volume ends, she is waiting in a boarding house in Cape Town with her
new son Peter for a ship to England. She knows that there will be a good
outcome as she watches and waits. Her manuscript of The Grass is Singing has
preceded her.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Books: The serial killer as a symbol of success - The cult
of the anti-hero has come a long way since Chaucer's 'smyler with the knyf'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOAN SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do the following authors have in common: Paul Theroux, William Trevor,
Brett Easton Ellis, Michael Dibdin, Peter Ackroyd, PD James, Thomas Harris,
Patricia D. Cornwell? The answer is that each of them has written one or
more novels featuring a serial killer.
It is a crowded but potentially lucrative field. Since the huge success of
The Silence of the Lambs, publishers and studio executives are on the
look-out for the next Thomas Harris. The American author Patricia Cornwell,
who has made serial killers her speciality, has set up her own film company
and is looking for an actress to play her pathologist heroine Dr Kay
Scarpetta.
Cornwell's novel Cruel and Unusual won last year's Gold Dagger, the top
award for crime fiction in Britain. Her first novel, Post-Mortem, won just
about every crime writing award in Britain and the US. Another Gold Dagger
winner, the English author Michael Dibdin, is writing a serial killer novel,
Dark Spectre, which is due to be published in Britain next spring.
The American writer Brett Easton Ellis received a critical drubbing in 1991
for American Psycho, in which a disaffected Wall Street whizz-kid fantasised
about a gruesome series of murders in New York. Unabashed, Ellis's new
novel, The Informers, rises to a crescendo of violence with a series of
vampiric killings in Los Angeles.
The American feminist historian Jane Caputi has called the 20th century 'the
age of sex crime'. It might seem that these authors are reflecting a natural
preoccupation with a brutal crime which was virtually unknown until the
closing decades of the Victorian era. Brett Easton Ellis would argue, I
suspect, that the crimes committed or contemplated by his characters
symbolise the moral bankruptcy of contemporary American society.
Patricia Cornwell identifies herself and her character, Dr Scarpetta, with
the forces of law and order, characterising serial killers as 'black holes
who (have) sucked light from the planet Earth'. Her new novel, The Body
Farm, is dedicated to the right-wing US senator Orrin Hatch 'for his
tireless fight against crime'.
The body farm is a real place, a research institute where corpses are
exposed to immersion in water or extreme temperatures to establish rates of
decay. Thomas Harris's novels are partly set at Quantico, the FBI academy in
West Virginia which almost no-one had heard of before it appeared in Red
Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs.
Harris's novels are scary, melodramatic, brilliantly-written, and in at
least one important respect deviate drastically from reality. His convicted
killer Hannibal Lecter has become a cult figure whose devious mind easily
outdistances anyone who tangles with him. Anthony Hopkins played him in
Jonathan Demme's film as a still, menacing presence who could see right into
the soul of Clarice Starling, the rookie FBI agent played by Jodie Foster.
Hopkins as Lecter has nothing in common with the grim police mugshots of
real-life serial killers: Albert DeSalvo, John Wayne Gacy, Peter Sutcliffe,
Colin Ireland, Sirhan Sirhan, Bobby Joe Long, Henry Lee Lucas. What tends to
characterise serial killers is a haunting and intolerable sense of their own
inadequacy - often, in the case of men who kill women, a fear of
vulnerability which they project onto the female body.
Killing strangers is, for this group, a survival mechanism. If they were as
glamorous and charismatic as Hannibal Lecter, they would not be serial
killers. By contrast, the serial killer in contemporary fiction is an
anti-hero for our times, incarnating powerful but seldom acknowledged
communal fantasies. At the simplest level, he fulfils a longing for
contemporary legends, for supernatural beings in an age in which magic and
religion have been debunked by science.
Patricia Cornwell's most recent novels have featured a serial killer called
Temple Brooks Gault. In Cruel and Unusual, Gault hacks into the FBI computer
and switches his own fingerprints with those of a murderer who has just gone
to the electric chair. A brilliant fictional device, it sets up Gault, like
Lecter, as an epic anti-hero, a master of disguise who escapes detection in
spite of the fact that 'his face smiled from the Ten Most Wanted lists
posted across the land'.
Gault and Lecter are dramatic representations of stranger-danger, the idea
of the unknown as simultaneously beguiling and threatening.
This notion can be traced all the way back to 'the smyler with the knyf' in
Chaucer's Knight's Tale; in the serial killer novel, the reader is allowed
vicarious contact with this thrilling, terrifying stranger in the knowledge
that he or she will come out of it alive. In this sense the novels offer a
frisson, cheap thrills, but there is more to them than that. Where violence
is concerned, Cornwell's books outdo everything except perhaps American
Psycho, offering graphic descriptions of crime scenes, wounds and
dissections. They offer a challenge to readers, a how-much-more-can-you-take
contest in which the answer, judging by Cornwell's huge sales, is anything
she chooses to present to them.
It might be assumed that nothing could portray the harsh reality of death
more vividly than these incarnadine novels, yet the cumulative effect is
precisely the opposite. The reader becomes habituated to the whirring of
cranial saws, to stomachs plopping onto dissection tables, to the tragedy
that lies behind each cadaver. This is a species of narrative in which the
corpse functions chiefly as clue: the plot, and the solution, are written on
the body.
In a telling exchange in Cruel and Unusual, Dr Scarpetta's female assistant
admits her fear that there is no afterlife. Scarpetta reassures her,
explaining that she draws her wisdom on the subject from dealing with
corpses: 'Something's gone. You look at their faces and you can tell. Their
energy has departed. The spirit didn't die. Just the body did'.
This unfamiliar vagueness from a character who is usually as sharp as a
scalpel is suggestive, a hint that in order to carry out her ghastly job Dr
Scarpetta (and perhaps her creator) has to indulge in an act of denial. It
also summarises the moral impact of the serial killer novel, which is to rob
death of its sting; no longer the end, it becomes merely the essential
opening gambit in an exhilarating fictional process.
The Body Farm is published by Little Brown (Pounds 14.99, 324 pages); Cruel
and Unusual by Warner Books, (Pounds 4.99, 437 pages). Dark Spectre will be
published by Faber &amp; Faber in April. 1995 The Informers is published by
Picador, (Pounds 9.99, 226 pages).

FT  22 OCT 94 / Books: From cosy reassurance to urban terror - Children's
books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BROWNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Warm reassurance permeates many young children's picture books this autumn.
The best of these sanguine stories is So Much, written by Trish Cooke and
illustrated by Helen Oxenbury (Walker Books Pounds 8.99). The unpretentious,
poetic text tells the story of a mother and baby who await the start of
father's birthday party. Various lively members of the family arrive and
they all want to squeeze the baby, kiss him and fight with him because they
love him 'so much'.
Cooke's text is an inspiration to Oxenbury, who uses three different styles
throughout the book. Instead of her usual pencil and wash, there are soft
black and white drawings of the baby, almost monochrome studies of
stationary groups, and large, expressive gouache paintings of vigorous
colour and movement. It is always a delight to see an established artist
taking risks, breaking new ground, and succeeding brilliantly.
Another book dealing with a similar theme is Guess How Much I Love You,
written by Sam McBratney and illustrated by Anita Jeram (Walker Books Pounds
7.99). Little Nut Brown Hare and Big Nut Brown Hare compete to see who loves
each other most. ''I love you as high as I can hop,' laughed Little Nut
Brown Hare, bouncing up and down. 'But I love you as high as I can hop,'
smiled Big Nut Brown Hare - and he hopped so high that his ears touched the
branches above.' I find the story too knowingly cute. But it is charmingly
illustrated in a nostalgic English style and printed on beautiful cream
paper. It should do well in the US.
Colin McNaughton seems to have updated Pat Hutchins' Rosie's Walk in his
hilarious new book Suddenly (Andersen Press Pounds 8.99). Here a pig
cheerfully walks home totally unaware that a Big Bad Wolf is stalking him.
Just when it seems that the pig must be caught he changes direction and the
wolf is thwarted, again and again. There is a funny reassuring ending when
the pig finally gets home to see a wolf-like shape at the sink who turns out
to be his mother. The story flows through the pictures like a silent Buster
Keaton film, but as always with Colin McNaughton the words are never
superfluous - he cleverly avoids mentioning the wolf at all. Children will
love this book.
The Bear by Raymond Briggs (Julia McRae Pounds 9.99), is a huge book with
familiar echoes. The story opens as a girl is tucked into bed with her teddy
bear. As she drifts into sleep we see through the window a small grey shape
looming towards her. In Briggs's characteristic soft crayon picture-strip
the shape gets nearer and nearer until we see a large paw opening her
window. On turning the page we are confronted, like the girl, with the
massive head of a polar bear. The beast comes in and, as she persuades it to
get into her bed, the teddy bear is kicked out.
The book hovers between reality and imagination; the bear is very real and
wonderfully drawn, and the girl has to clear up its mess, but the silvery,
ghostly shimmer of the creature gives a dream-like feeling to the story. We
have seen many books where a large furry animal comes into a child's
bedroom. And there are similarities to The Snowman and The Man, but the
superb drawings of the bear and the cinematic use of light and scale
transform well-worn material into a delightful and satisfying picture book.
There is no cosy reassurance in Way Home written by Libby Hathorn and
illustrated by Gregory Rogers (Andersen Press Pounds 8.99). From the
crumpled paper endpapers and the stark ripped black and white title-page we
know we are in very different territory. This is the dangerous inner city at
night and we travel with Shane as he takes home a stray kitten, running
terrified from a gang, leaping through screaming traffic, escaping a fierce
dog and finally arriving 'home' - a street shelter made from rubble. The
stunning artwork and brilliant design of this dark book make it an exciting
read for older children. I have the feeling, though, that not many will get
the chance to see it.

THE ETHICAL PRIMATE: HUMANS, FREEDOM AND MORALITY by Mary Midgley Routledge
Pounds 17.99, 193 pages
Intellectual history is full of attempts to reduce the complexities of human
behaviour to a single set of motives and characteristics. The latest
academic fundamentalists are those scientists who seek to debunk
philosophy's most profound dilemmas by claiming that our increased
biological knowledge of the human mind will provide the answers.
Mary Midgley, one of Britain's most engaged moral philosophers, will not
hear of such arguments. In this dense, but clearly-written counter-attack,
she stands up for the inherent knots and ambiguities which afflict so much
of our ethical discussion and seeks to find a more sophisticated framework
for future debate.
Her problem is, to philosophers at least, a familiar one: how to evade
crude, mechanistic accounts of human motivation without collapsing into a
kind of despairing relativism which has become a mocking key-note of today's
post-modern intellectual culture.
She begins her thesis by attacking some of the embedded positions which have
led us to this unseemly impasse: the false dualisms created by philosophers
between mind and matter, and between reason and feeling; the 'machine hype'
which champions those views of the human world which most closely correspond
to the physical world (she shrewdly includes both Marxism and free market
capitalism); and the over-simplistic notions of social Darwinism which have
also been plundered to serve economic ends.
All these positions, she explains, fail to take account of our 'slight and
misty nature'; they ignore the striking contradiction that we are frequently
divided but constantly seek to act as a unity, a predicament she describes
as 'a constantly ongoing project, a difficult, essentially incomplete
integration which can occupy our whole lives.'
Midgley is surely correct in identifying the modern attitude to religion as
part of the problem: she claims that secular philosophy has always found the
idea of 'deep, difficult inner conflict' unpalatable, as it was closely
linked with religious thinking.
'Enlightenment intellectuals, associating religion with folly, obscurantism,
asceticism and political oppression, deeply distrusted the very idea of
irremovable inner conflict. They also needed a fairly optimistic view about
human motivation in order to make the various revolutions they were
proposing look possible,' she says.
That we are still slaves to the Enlightenment project, despite the violent
denunciations of a Nietzsche or a Sartre, is central to Midgley's argument.
But the problems of the 20th century are not those of the 18th century; the
zeal of the atheist, such a dynamic intellectual force in a social context
of religious conformity, today is matched against a much-enfeebled enemy,
and has, in Midgley's view, over-stretched itself.
She seeks a way forward by turning to Darwin's own work on morality, and to
the significance of the 'quieter motives', those persistent undertones of
social awareness which we all possess, and which frequently over-ride our
urgent desire to be passionate, greedy, angry or resentful at any one
moment.
She also focuses on the binding power of 'sympathy', a value which has been
unjustly neglected due to its refusal to fall neatly into either side of the
thought/feeling divide, but which characterises so many human responses.
This is common-sense philosophy of the highest order; one can only hope that
more professional philosophers embrace the campaign against the slick
certainties and theoretical glibness of today's false prophets.

AGE OF EXTREMES: THE SHORT TWENTIETH CENTURY 1914-1991 by Eric Hobsbawm
Michael Joseph Pounds 20, 627 pages
Professor Eric Hobsbawm is usually described as a Marxist historian. This
can mean many things, from a slavish belief in the great man's prophetic
power to appreciation of the importance of economic factors in history. This
book is an epilogue to a trilogy on European history - the Ages of
Revolution, Capitalism and Empire - which has been widely praised. In these
volumes and his latest work the author is by no means a doctrinaire disciple
of Marx, let alone of the USSR, which purported to be the embodiment of
Marx's beliefs and the standard-bearer of his cause.
Hobsbawm divides his book into three parts: 'The Age of Catastrophe' -
1914-50; 'The Golden Age' - 1950-75; 'The Landslide' - 1975 onwards. The
first covers what he calls 'The Thirty One Years War'; the second the
immense - and to him unexpected - capitalist post-war boom which has
transformed the world; and the third, a period that he sees as one of a
slide into instability, crisis and general loss of bearings. He prefaces his
opening section with a quotation from Isaiah Berlin: 'I have lived through
most of the 20th century without, I must add, suffering personal hardship. I
remember it only as the most terrible century in Western history'. Few will
wish to dispute this judgment.
The causes of the 1914-18 war have been the subject of great controversy.
Why could the conflict not have been settled by diplomacy as a Bismark or a
Talleyrand would certainly have attempted? Hobsbawm explains its
all-or-nothing nature by the fact that, unlike previous wars waged for
limited objectives, this was waged for unlimited ends. That was true, and
even truer of the second world war, but the question why still remains. In
the case of the 1939-45 war Hobsbawm has no doubt. It was essentially
Hitler's war for world power. Nor, despite the smoke screen put up by
post-1918 German historians, can one seriously defend the rulers of Germany
in 1914 from the same charge, though the author does not say so.
What he rightly emphasises is that the second world war, unlike the first,
was ideological as well as nationalistic, and that there were three
ideologies - fascism, liberal democracy and communism - which were equally
antipathetic to each other. It was a paradox of the principle that 'my
enemy's enemy is my friend', which produced the alliance of opposites from
1941 onwards.
Without the USSR the Western allies could not have won, and its success in
waging war gave a spurious plausibility to its 'command economy' in peace.
Stalin's forced industrialisation during the 1920s and 1930s was already
such an economy, and it had at least avoided the traumatic experience of the
Great Slump.
Even as late as 1960 Harold Macmillan thought that the USSR might soon
outstrip the economic successes of the west. In fact it was already
collapsing under its own contradictions. Hobsbawm, however sympathetic he
may once have been with Marxism, is a realist and his analysis of the
collapse is shrewd and perceptive.
What would most surprise earlier Marxists is the recrudescence of capitalism
after 1945. But their hero was a poor prophet. He foresaw neither fascism
nor the welfare state and his confidence in the proletarian triumph has
turned out, like most theories of inevitablism, to be wrong.
Whatever the reason - and one can agree that there is no simple explanation
 -capitalism in the 'Golden Age' flourished as never before and brought
about vast changes in the way of life and the standard of living all over
the world. Its success has killed socialism. Marxist socialism was a
religion. But a religion of materialism has a weakness which spiritual
religions do not possess. No one can prove by experience that Christianity,
Islam or Buddism are wrong. A religion which purports to improve the
material welfare of mankind is in a different category. If it does not
deliver the goods sooner or later people will stop believing it.
From the mid 1970s the Golden Age gives way to the Landslide. The period
certainly saw major changes - the end of socialism for one. The former USSR
and its ex-satellites were indeed in a state of chaos and disarray -
transitional perhaps but no one can be sure. The capitalist world has seen
more recessions and higher unemployment than in the previous quarter
century, but 'landslide' seems an over statement. The very fact that 'Black
Monday' in 1987 did not herald a repeat of 1929-31 suggests that there are
stabilising factors present now which were not then. Nor is it convincing to
talk of the weakening of the nation state, despite Marx's dislike of it.
There are more of them then ever, and this most significant legacy of the
French Revolution shows no sign of going away. Fifteen years is not a long
period for historical perspective. Eric Hobsbawm has written a brilliant and
stimulating book. But like most historians he is better on the past than the
present.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Books: Lifting the lid on Sylvia Plath - With this morally
challenging book, post-modern biography has come of age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SILENT WOMAN: SYLVIA PLATH AND TED HUGHES by Janet Malcolm Picadore
Pounds 14.99, 215 pages
The Silent Woman is about one of the loudest literary voices this century.
In the icy winter of 1962-3, Sylvia Plath wrote her pitiless, death-obsessed
Ariel poems, stuck her head in a gas oven and killed herself. Her words have
reverberated ever since - 'dying - is an art', 'every woman adores a
fascist' - and yet because they are so powerfully emotive, they have also
been distorted, misinterpreted, muffled.
This book tells two tales: how Plath gained the courage to speak with this
electrifying voice in the first place, the story of her life; and what her
desire to interpret that voice reveals about our own culture - the story of
her afterlife. It is a brilliant mix and a landmark in the history of
biography.
Plath was a clean, golden-haired American girl with dark lipstick who came
to England in the 1950s and married the poet Ted Hughes. She looked like an
advertisement for soap powder, but beneath the gloss was a tormented,
tempestuous woman who was rarely nice to know.
She broke up a family Christmas, stole food from other people's
refrigerators, fantasised about killing some schoolgirls who took flowers
from a park. Her relationship with her mother was sick, and she devoured men
for breakfast, writing afterwards of the 'orange-juice-and-broiled-chicken'
and 'plain steak and potatoes with nothing done to them taste' of the dull
ones. Hughes by contrast was a giant who filled 'that huge sad hole I felt
in having no father.' On their first meeting she bit him until he bled;
months after he left her, she died.
It was Malcolm, who calls 'her courage to be unpleasant', that made her a
feminist heroine. 'I see you have a concentration camp in your mind, too,'
Plath once told the poet George MacBeth. Hughes has described how she fought
to find her authentic voice - beautiful, severe, glacial. Malcolm sees this
as part of a key historical moment in which the 'uneasy, shifty-eyed' 1950s
generation finally threw off 19th century repression and embraced the brave
new world of feminism, Vietnam protests and the civil rights movement.
Plath was the voice for the times; no post-war poet has expressed more
eloquently the anxieties - womens' struggles, political tyranny and
repression, psychological breakdown - of our century. But Plath's life was
also emblematic, for she was the first great woman writer in creativity and
domesticity who waged war. Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, George Eliot, Virginia
Woolf, none attempted everyday family life. Plath, by contrast, fumed at
being 'a prisoner in this house, chained to the children,' while Hughes
swanned off. She wrote the Ariel poem in a blaze of domestic misery and
marital break-up.
In the private lives obsession of the 1980s and '90s, this is the part of
Plath's story which, fuelled by Hughes reticence and his control over the
Plath estate, has become the stuff of legend. Malcolm is inspired on the
transgressive nature of biography - the only explanation she says, for the
genre's popular appeal - and wittingly invites the reader to tiptoe with her
'down the corridor together to stand in front of the bedroom door and try to
peep through the keyhole.'
Her genius however, is to turn the tables and to rough up Plath's
biographers and critics as they have roughed up Plath - reading their mail,
quizzing their friends and gossiping about their houses. Thus she draws us,
deeply and uneasily, into what really happens in the making of the modern
biography.
Malcolm is not someone to invite home lightly. Take her visit to Ann
Stevenson, whose 1987 Life of Plath was vituperatively reviewed for
pandering to Hughes and for its omissions. Around the kitchen table,
Stevenson reveals her problems in working with Hughes, her dissatisfaction
with her book - she eventually published in part because she could not
afford to repay the advance.
Malcolm purrs sympathetically, then turns the knife with a story of
Stevenson cooking lasagne, omitting the white sauce, serving up the dish
reluctantly because there is nothing else.
Domesticity as metaphor, life as art; Malcolm has the novelist's ability to
convey the essence through an exquisite piece of bitchiness. A critic who
sometimes misjudges Sylvia lives in a crooked Hampstead house and serves
coffee out of rigid square cups. The handsome flat of the handsome
structuralist academic with the crisp voice and the crisp handsome ideas . .
. the trains and plumbing that do not work in the cold winter of 1991, when
Malcolm came to England from New York to research the book and which
recalled the icy months in 1963 when Plath was an American alone in a
primitive country . . .
With The Silent Woman, post-modern biography has come of age. Ventures of
this kind usually fail because post-modern theories - that there is no
truth, that no one owns another's life - are never as compelling as a well
told story. Malcolm overcomes this with a dazzling method of rendering the
best of traditional biography, choice snippets which sum up a life, the
making of an artist, cultural history - without the longueurs. It is
intellectually explosive, morally challenging and enormous fun.

THE SIGN OF THE CROSS: TRAVELS IN CATHOLIC EUROPE by Colm Toibin Jonathan
Cape Pounds 16.99, 296 pages
JOHN PAUL II by Michael Walsh HarperCollins Pounds 20, 320 pages
A few years ago a Moslem friend exploded on reading VS Naipaul's Amongst the
Believers: how could Naipaul dismiss Islam in this way? In his depiction of
a handful of Moslem countries, the unbeliever paraded his prejudices by
profiling only intransigent imams and authoritarian ayatollahs, and by
caricaturing spiritual codes.
I had little sympathy at the time. Religions, after all, have borne the
scrutiny of inveterate infidels for millennia. But after reading a similar
undertaking, a peregrination through Catholic Europe by the Irish novelist
Colm Toibin, I find myself echoing my friend: the sacred may be politicised,
but it should not be profaned.
Disenchanted with the religion of his childhood, Toibin seems bent not so
much on a journey of discovery, but on a quest to diminish the divine, to
view Catholicism as mere 'consolation' akin to 'listening to music after a
long day's work; it was pure theatre'.
Politicisation of the church is inherent in its teaching - the gospel, after
all, was interpreted by Christ's contemporaries as a revolutionary message,
for which he was duly crucified. But the centuries have wrought a political
permutation to the Church of Rome - its accumulation of capital and power
has placed it squarely at the heart of the Establishment, and its emphasis
on the authority of the Magisterium (the church's teaching) has lost it many
allies in an age when authority has become synonymous with authoritarianism.
It is this view of the church that fuels Toibin's journey. He marshalls
events, characters and rituals in order to vindicate a pre-determined
ideological position: Catholicism prepares the ground for the seeds of
authoritarian regimes. By imparting its message of obedience to spiritual
authority, the church serves as a factory that mass produces disciples for
the latest despot.
The theory has been around for some time, but fails to account for a number
of historical incidents and political strains. Although Toibin allows that
the 'first open demonstration in Slovakia against the regime was organised
through the Catholic Church' in 1988, and he does recognise the Jesuits'
anti-Mafia campaign in southern Italy, he chooses to belittle a number of
other instances when European Catholicism allied itself to the right cause,
not the Right camp, and helped pave the way for democracy, not dictatorship.
Toibin seeks to limit Catholicism to an aesthetic canon - he offers us
vivid, lyrical impressions of Spanish religious processions, of Polish
churches and Slav pilgrimage sites - and to a socio-cultural influence that
shapes and colours temporal occupations and aspirations. Certainly, in a
number of the countries he visits (particularly Poland, Italy, Ireland and
Spain) the Church does permeate national identity by influencing everything
from divorce laws to the sanctification of the fatherland.
But the ultimate legacy of the Catholic Church is a spiritual one. It is in
its message of hope, and of the importance of even the most marginalised
members of society, that Catholicism has proved such a powerful influence on
this generation of Europeans. To underestimate this legacy is to
misunderstand an important part of 20th century history - and to
underestimate, too, the role played by the remarkable man who has led the
church through the past 16 years, John Paul II.
In his biography of Karol Wojtyla, the first non-Italian pope since the 16th
century, Michael Walsh lays down his cards at the outset: he had
reservations about the cardinal from Cracow when he was elected to the See
of St Peter, and 'as the years have gone by I have seen no reason to change
my original judgment'.
Walsh, a former Jesuit, is a liberal Catholic who sees the church as
guardian of the gospel message in its social context - love, solidarity and
helping the poor and dispossessed. He does not, however, long for the
certainty of spiritual absolutes which Karol Wojtyla delivers. Where some
more traditionalist Catholics applaud the present pope for dusting off the
sacred system of correspondences between heaven and earth, Walsh sees this
shepherd as bent on keeping his flock in an uncomfortably tight pen.
Walsh carefully charts the papacy, analysing both failures (in particular
the financial scandal of the Banco Ambrosiano) and successes (the behind-the
scenes work in helping Lech Walesa set up Solidarnosc and then toppling the
Communist regime, the campaigns against right-wing dictators from Chile's
Pinochet to Haiti's Baby Doc). And he analyses, too, the writings of the
prolific pontiff - from his first encyclical, Redemptor Hominis to what must
surely be regarded as his spiritual testament, the hard-hitting 1993
encyclical, Veritatis Splendor, with its fulminations against subjective
morality and the a la carte Catholicism favoured by the majority of
Catholics in the west.
Though Walsh finds it difficult to feel sympathy with the theological hard
line towed by the Polish pontiff, even he cannot detract from the undoubted
achievement of a pope who dragged the Catholic Church from the sidelines to
the centre of the world political arena.

THE PENGUIN BOOK OF INFIDELITIES edited by Stephen Brook Viking Pounds 17,
376 pages
Cecil Parkinson, the Tory politician, will blush - or swell - to hear it,
but his fame as an adulterer looks likely to last, judged by his inclusion
in Stephen Brook's witty and life-enhancing anthology of infidelities
throughout the ages.
The scope is broad. As the dust-jacket says: 'The reader will find scenes of
tenderness and of sorrow, of bitterness and of rage, of ecstasy and of farce
. . . The depravities of ancient Rome are compounded by the exuberant lust
of the Earl of Rochester's poems . . . We learn of the exploits of such
famous adulterers as James Boswell, Lord Byron and Cecil Parkinson.'
Parkinson? You would have thought that interest in his homely little
adultery with his homely former secretary, Sara Keays, which caused him to
resign from the Thatcher government, had faded by now, given the tide of
misbehaviour, in circles high and low, that has swamped us in the meantime.
Yet here he is, accorded a spot in an all-time hit parade of bounders,
seducers and other sorts of heart-breakers.
Infidelity, says Brook, is dangerous, for it confounds the stable order. But
it is also exhilarating, at least to those concerned. And it is certainly
commonplace. A study of American marriage published seven years ago reckoned
that half of all Americans have been adulterous at some time. Another study
put the figure at 70 per cent.
With some exceptions, most societies take a dim view of adultery, though in
most places female lapses tend to be punished more severely than male.
Almost all the writers you would hope to see represented in this anthology
are represented, from Amis (both) to Boccaccio, Wilde and Wharton,
Strindberg and Suetonius. But connoisseurs will notice several obvious
omissions. The reason, says Brook, is simply quality of writing. For
example, both Henry Miller and Anais Nin are absent because he cannot bear
their prose styles. On the other hand, 'classic texts' of infidelity,
including Troilus and Cressida, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary and the novels
of Colette, are represented by substantial excerpts.
There are plenty of jokes: 'You know, of course, that the Tasmanians, who
never committed adultery, are now extinct' - Somerset Maugham.
And plenty of surprises. I was especially captivated by the notorious Miss
Chudleigh, who fascinated the Earl of Bath, nearly married the Duke of
Hamilton, went to a ball in a gauze dress and caught the eye of George II,
secretly wed the future Earl of Bristol, conquered Frederick II, bigamously
married the Duke of Kingston, inherited his fortune, retired to Russia and
finished up in France, where she purchased a royal palace for Pounds 50,000.
She died in 1788, aged 68, after other love affairs. She was painted in her
gauze dress, wearing a ravishing smirk. The dress was a single garment,
quite transparent, and probably explained her career.
In company like that, Cecil Parkinson and his secretary come across as very
dismal potatoes.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: End the mobile menace - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER, GILES MACDONOGH and JILL JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the mail this week comes an impassioned, angry letter from a reader whose
meal at the Blueprint Cafe, London SE1, was ruined because neighbouring
diners made continuous use of mobile telephones.
Britain has the highest concentration of mobile phones in Europe with 20 per
1,000 people. Although some restaurants, particularly in hotels, have a sign
asking customers to leave phones with the receptionist, many do not and the
problem is likely to get worse.
A bottle of pink champagne is offered to the reader who proposes the best
solution to this restaurant nuisance. And another bottle for the best
one-liner with which to silence those who choose to use phones loudly and
over-zealously in public places.
PJ's Bar and Grill (52 Fulham Road, London, SW3, tel: 071-581 0025) is a
lively nightspot which took over the site of one of the dullest pubs on the
Fulham Road. It serves decent food and wines with the accent placed on the
new world.
PJ's latest venture has been to sell a range of cask-strength malt whiskies
by the glass. There are seven in all, of which the least impressive are two
vintages of Knockdhu, a Speyside malt which has gone over to bottling only
recently.
The other five, however, were very fine: a 1984 Bladnoch with all the
delicacy and elegance of a Lowland malt; a 1979 Benrinnes with an aroma of
toffee and hazelnuts; a fine 1973 Glenrothes which put me in mind of sponge
cake; and a 1975 Ardbeg which was all you would expect from this great Islay
 -all iodine and new leather.
The best of the lot was a 1965 Springbank from Campbeltown: the nose seemed
one-dimensional and too strongly marked by a sherry butt, but the palate was
wonderfully complex.
I love that mix of directness and scarcely-concealed irritation that French
chef Albert Roux manages to convey in the London newspaper, the Evening
Standard, in his column answering readers' queries about food.
It is the naff questions that make the column such a good read: 'Dear Albert
 -How can I make the definitive cooked English breakfast.'
Who, in England, needs to ask any Frenchman that?
Nevertheless, the Roux solutions to these cris de coeur are often charming
and funny: 'Dear Albert, I was as surprised as my husband was pleased when
he came back from the pub with two pheasants and an unskinned hare. These
dead animals are now cluttering up my kitchen. What do I do?'
Roux's answer: 'My love, bring them to Le Gavroche (his restaurant) at 3pm,
then go shopping, take a bath, make yourself even more beautiful and return
to Le Gavroche at 7.30pm, with your husband in tow, in time for pre-dinner
drinks.'
These questions and answers have now been compiled in a book, Cher Albert
(Pavilion, Pounds 9.99, 128 pages) and provide a very jolly read.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Just a little local difficulty - Wine / A
look at a sour taste in the northern Rhone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does France's oldest wine region need an enfant terrible? Almost certainly
not, but never mind, Michel Chapoutier shows no signs of either growing up
or calming down, which makes life for the rest of us extremely entertaining.
His neighbouring vine growers on the famous, vine-covered hill of Hermitage
in the northern Rhone Valley just south of Lyons are less amused. Indeed the
atmosphere in the tiny, wine-dominated town of Tain l'Hermitage, where all
but one of the famous names of the Rhone are based, has become distinctly
vinegary.
The trouble with young Chapoutier, who took over this substantial family
business from his father as recently as 1989, is that what he makes up for
in fervour, he lacks in statesmanship. He is diminutive, wears a swot's
pebble glasses, has a rare passion for irony and visibly tries, invariably
unsuccessfully, to control his tongue.
He is utterly besotted with bio-dynamism, the Steiner-inspired farming
techniques which involve regenerating the soil in harmony with astrology. He
is also convinced that low yields are the key to wine quality, and usually
accompanies his tasting notes with impressively low hectolitre-per-hectare
statistics.
Michel Chapoutier is equally convinced, however, that most other producers
in the northern Rhone (including his father Max) have got it wrong, and
rarely misses an opportunity to point this out.
Things came to a head this summer when Robert Parker, the influential
American wine critic, clearly much taken with the intensely concentrated
'new' Chapoutier style, printed Michel's complaints that during the
difficult, wet 1993 growing season the chemicals used by neighbouring
vine-growers affected the margins of his vineyards, leaving them vulnerable
to the fungal diseases which ravaged many non-biodynamic vineyards.
The result was an intemperate letter to Parker from the creme de la creme of
Hermitage, including Gerard Jaboulet, Chave, and Delas, vilifying
Chapoutier, claiming that his Hermitage vineyard had in fact been treated
with weedkiller, and had been sprayed by helicopter. These other growers
also included some figures which suggested that Chapoutier's average yields
were considerably higher than he claimed.
Now Michel Chapoutier has issued his response in this dispute between the
most prominent inhabitants of Tain l'Hermitage (population 5,000), all of
whom work cheek by jowl.
He must have chuckled at the helicopter accusation, for of course there is
nothing essentially anti-organic about heli-spraying - indeed the fanatical
Lalou Bize-Leroy, 'the queen of Burgundy', applied several tisanes by
helicopter to her world-famous vineyards last year.
The weedkiller claim is furiously rejected by Chapoutier and described as
one of the most serious. His reply also contains some laborious play with
statistics, notably with red and white wine areas as factors, to demonstrate
that Chapoutier's yields in Hermitage were a relatively modest 33.15 hl/ha
in 1993 (in Chateauneuf-du-Pape just 20.46 hl/ha).
The rain, which also dogged this year's harvest in the northern Rhone, is
unlikely to wash away the issues involved in this dispute, however. Gerard
Chave describes Chapoutier's response as 'Unbelievable. I have never seen
anything like this in the whole of my professional life.'
Chapoutier acknowledges in his reply that he is widely criticised for being
young and passionate, and claims that it is his youth which spurs him to
take a long-term view, embracing the methods and low yields which he
believes will preserve the good name of France's great wine appellations.
What is interesting, he concludes, is to ponder the real motivation of his
angry neighbours? With the irritating tunnel vision of any young
revolutionary, he suggests they are propelled by fear of these 'new'
techniques, and the sacrifices that will be necessary to implement them.
In modern viticulture, radicalism means a return to traditional roots, a
rejection of the commercial agrochemistry which has transformed vineyards in
the last three decades. In winemaking too Chapoutier is notable for an
attachment to ancient methods, particularly the much-photographed
twice-daily pigeage, during which four muscley legs stomp down grape skins
in the firm's unfashionably open-topped, wooden fermentation vats.
Certainly the new Chapoutier wines, from 1989 onwards, are impressive. They
are refreshingly wild and intense (just like their maker), the sort of dense
essences that require good cellaring and careful handling.
And they are available in the sort of quantities that propel all but the
most limited bottlings into major distribution (Marks and Spencer even tried
its hand with a Chapoutier Rasteau but it was far too risque for it).
Majestic, Oddbins, Thresher, Adnams of Southwold, Averys of Bristol,
Gauntleys of Nottingham, Justerini &amp; Brooks of London SW1 and Edinburgh and
Tanners of Shrewsbury all stock some wines from the new regime.
What young Chapoutier needs is an adviser, less a Max Clifford publicist
than Marcel Guigal, the softly spoken wizard of Cote-Rotie 40 minutes' drive
upriver. 'Calm down,' has been his advice to all.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Fragrant and sweet - Cookery / The second
part of a rice treat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week, I talked about different types of rice with Margaret Shaida, an
Oxfordshire-born journalist and historian who married an Iranian and lived
in her husband's homeland for 25 years.
Here is the second rice dish that Shaida cooked for me, said to have
originated at court in Isfahan. Variations given in Shaida's book, The
Legendary Cuisine of Persia, due to be published by Penguin (Pounds 12) on
November 3, include lamb with dried apricots, and duck with barberries or
sour cherries.
BAKED SAFFRON RICE WITH CHICKEN AND SPINACH (serves 8)
A 4pt round ovenproof bowl is needed for cooking this dish. A Pyrex mixing
bowl is ideal as it enables you to check that the crust is turning golden
all over as it should. Iranians will wince at the unorthodoxy but two of the
people who sampled this dish when I made it liked it best with a gravy
spoonful or two of rich chicken broth poured over the white rice at table.
1lb dom siah or good quality basmati rice; 12oz chicken breast fillets
(skinned and boned weight); 1 1/2 lb fresh spinach; 1 fat garlic clove
crushed with a little salt; 7 fl oz plain yoghurt; 2 small eggs; a good
pinch of saffron, pounded and soaked in scant 2 tablespoons boiling water; 3
fl oz sunflower or other light tasting vegetable oil; 3oz butter.
Cook the chicken a day ahead using the following method: Wrap each fillet
separately in a double layer of food film, twisting the ends like a cracker
and tying them with string. Drop the parcels into a pan of boiling water and
cook at a bare simmer for 10 minutes. Lift the parcels out of the pan and
leave for five minutes before unwrapping. Drain off the juices, cut the meat
into large chunks and season with salt and pepper.
Beat the eggs with the yoghurt. Add the crushed garlic and cool saffron
liquid. Stir in the chicken. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Next day, wash the rice under a cold running tap for several minutes. Then
leave it to soak for three hours in 4pts cold water with three tablespoons
salt.
Wash the spinach, strip off any tough stalks and cook the leaves until
tender in the water that clings to it. Squeeze well to drain off as much
liquid as possible, season lightly with salt and plenty of pepper and set
aside to cool.
Bring 4pt water and three tablespoons salt to a rolling boil. Add the
drained rice, bring back to the boil, cover and cook for no longer than two
minutes before testing the grain. It should be soft on the outside and still
firm (but not brittle) in the centre. It may need half a minute or so more
to reach this stage but probably not much longer. Remember the grain will
continue to soften as it steams.
Drain the parboiled rice, preferably in a rice colander to avoid compressing
it, and rinse it in cold water.
Now for the messy bit. Measure the oil into the 4pt ovenproof bowl and swirl
to coat the interior all over. Lift the chicken out of the yoghurt mixture
and reserve it. Gradually add one-third to at most a half of the parboiled
and drained rice to the yoghurt, mixing it in gently but thoroughly with one
hand.
Tip this creamy-textured, pale yellow mixture into the oiled bowl. The aim
now is to line the sides of the bowl entirely with yellow rice, and to pile
the dry white rice into the centre. Do it gradually. First work the yellow
rice just a little way up the sides of the bowl with one hand, then sprinkle
some dry white rice into the centre with the other hand. Repeat. With a
little encouragement, as the white rice is added the yellow rice will rise
up the sides.
When the bowl is about half full put the chicken in a layer over the rice
taking care to keep it within a perimeter of yellow rice. Spread the spinach
over the meat, again leaving a ribbon of yellow rice round the edge. Then
continue drawing the yellow rice up round the sides of the bowl and fill the
centre with the rest of the white rice. This gets easier with practice.
Level the top. Cover closely with well-oiled kitchen foil and bake on a
baking tray at 400`F, 200`C, gas mark 6 for two hours, turning the bowl as
necessary for an even tan.
When the rice is cooked remove the bowl from the oven. Lift the foil
briefly, dot the rice with flakes of butter and replace the foil. The
chilled fat will arrest cooking and, as it melts and seeps into the rice and
down the sides of the bowl, it will loosen the mould making it easier to
turn out.
After five to 10 minutes run a palette knife or other long flexible blade
between the rice and the edge of the bowl. Cover the bowl with a large
warmed plate (a completely flat flan plate is best), invert and the bowl
should lift off cleanly.
The beautiful layering will be revealed when the rice mould is cut like a
cake for serving. First the crunchy outer shell of golden crust, then the
lining of cakey textured pale saffron rice with yoghurt, and finally a
central core of fragrant, free-running pure white grains. All this with
layers of tender chicken and sweet green spinach running across it.
A good selection of Iranian produce is available from Super Bahar, 349A
Kensington High Street, London W8.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: How to give that perfect dinner - Inviting
friends for a meal? Chef and author Ken Hom has some tips for up-and-coming
hosts / Entertaining at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN HOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty years ago, when I was much younger and more naive, I entertained
extravagantly. My dinner parties would have a minimum of 12 guests and no
fewer than 12 courses. I would spend days preparing elaborate and obscure
Chinese dishes.
I had much more time then and I had great pleasure and enjoyment preparing
those meals. However, in the last eight years, with a heavy travel schedule
and the pressures of a busy life, my style of entertaining has changed
radically.
Now, I usually have no more than six guests and just three courses. My
friends enjoy these intimate dinners as much as my lavish spreads of the
past. Here then, is how I entertain today, simply but still elegantly,
keeping the following tips in mind:
Invite friends you really want to see. Spending three hours at the dinner
table with good friends is my idea of bliss. Remember, conversation and mix
is almost as important as food and wine.
Do not invite the same guests all the time, it is nice to mix and match your
friends. Never have a party with all the guests from the same profession,
nothing is worse than talking shop all evening.
Do not skimp, buy the best ingredients and have good wines. This is vital if
you have only three courses. Your chances of success are greater if your
dishes are memorable.
Do not attempt new dishes, always entertain with tried and true recipes or
dishes which you feel comfortable with. You do not need the additional
stress of knowing whether the dish will be good or not.
However, you should feel free to mix and match dishes from different
cuisines. For example, you could begin with a Chinese soup, then serve a
lovely roast chicken with basmati rice, and perhaps a Thai stir-fry
vegetable dish.
Avoid trying to impress your guests. I always think it is grander to make
delicious simple food than to present pretentious mediocre dishes. There is
no need to stick too rigidly to other people's rules about food, if you like
fish with red wine, then serve it as such.
Remember to make dishes within the realm of home cooks. Chefs apart, I do
not think your guests should expect you to be proficient in restaurant
cooking. If you are making a Chinese meal, do not make more than two
stir-fry dishes at any one meal. There are many recipes in the Chinese
repertoire that are braised dishes, steamed, etc. and many can be prepared
ahead of time.
Light meals are usually the best remembered ones. That means light or no
sauces, avoid red meats, stick to fish or chicken. Nothing is worse than a
heavy meal which can stay with you for the whole night.
Although I rarely use a microwave to cook, I have discovered that it does
wonders to fish. It is as good as steaming the fish in the wok.
Soups, especially good ones are an elegant opening. I like them because I
can make them days, even a week ahead. They freeze extremely well and
re-heat beautifully. If you like cream soups, add the cream at the last
moment.
Give your dinner a few moments of thought before you plan it. All too often,
home cooks plunge into organising a dinner party without thought to the
balance of the meal, logistics, etc. Think about how you would feel as a
guest at this dinner. If your instincts tell you that the dinner will be
good, chances are it will be.
Start the evening with champagne, bubbles are always a festive start to any
meal. It immediately puts everyone in a good mood and is an important factor
that will determine how the rest of the evening will flow.
Buy the best - I especially like Louis Roederer - and, when it is special
occasion and I feel flush, I will have a bottle of Roederer Cristal. By the
way, I have found for my Chinese dinner parties that champagne is the
perfect drink throughout the meal. The acid and sweetness seems to balance
out the oils and flavours that one finds in Chinese cookery.
Do not clutter the table with a huge bouquet. Nothing is worse than trying
to converse with flowers in your face. Place one flower at each table
setting for a nicer and more elegant effect.
Finally, never panic. If something does not turn out the way you thought it
should, do not mention it. Patch it up as best as you can, smile, have
another glass of champagne and enjoy yourself.
Here are two recipes from a typical dinner party at my house, they are easy
to make and taste wonderful:
DOUBLE STEAMED MUSHROOM SOUP Double steaming involves an unusual method of
making a rich but clear soup. You must first prepare the soup in its own
covered pot, so that it is producing its own steam.
Then you place it on a rack over boiling water in another pot, cover the pot
tightly and steam the soup for three hours. This technique is usually
reserved for the finest ingredients with the most delicate flavours and
textures. Steaming is a gentle cooking method that works best with such
foods.
In this soup, the highest quality of dried mushrooms that money can buy are
used. They should be thick so that they can absorb all the flavours from the
long steaming process. The result is a clear, concentrated and rich consomme
redolent of the essence of mushroom. All the work can be done in advance. In
fact, the soup can even be frozen a week ahead and re-heated. This soup
would make an earthy and elegant opener for any meal.
50g/2oz finest quality dried Chinese black mushrooms; 900ml/2 pints/4 cups
chicken stock; salt to taste.
Soak the mushrooms in warm water for 20 minutes. Then drain them and squeeze
out the excess liquid. Remove and discard the stems.
Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large pot. Pour the stock and the
mushrooms into a pot or heatproof soup tureen. (This is the first steaming
process.) Cover the pot or tureen and set it on a rack inside a large
steamer. Keep this larger wok or pot tightly closed. Steam continuously for
three hours. Replenish the hot water from time to time as necessary.
Adjust the seasoning with salt to taste and serve at once or allow it to
cool thoroughly and freeze until it is needed.
QUICK STEAMED SALMON FILLETS
You can steam this dish in a wok or microwave. It cooks to perfection in the
microwave.
1 1/2 lbs/700g salmon fillets; 1 teaspoon salt;  1/4 teaspoon freshly ground
white pepper; 1 tablespoon Chinese Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry; 1
tablespoon light soy sauce; 3 tablespoons fresh chives, finely chopped; 3
spring onions, finely chopped; 2 teaspoons ginger, finely chopped; 1
tablespoon groundnut (peanut) oil; 2 teaspoons sesame oil.
Rub the salmon fillets evenly with salt and pepper, pour on the rice wine
and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
Prepare the rest of the ingredients. Cook the salmon in the microwave oven
at 100 per cent for 3-5 minutes, depending on its thickness. The salmon is
done when it feels firm and not spongy. Remove and let sit for three
minutes.
In the wok, combine the two oils and heat. While the oil is heating,
sprinkle the salmon with the soy sauce, chives, spring onions and ginger.
When the oils begin to smoke, pour this over the top, it should sizzle and
be served at once.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Travel: Camping it up in relaxed, small-town America -
Nicholas Woodsworth enjoys the friendliness of Cape Cod
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH

<TEXT>
I was on US Highway 6, 10 miles out on Cape Cod and heading eastwards off
the end of the continent. Looking down at my speedometer, I realised I was
driving too fast. Hair-whippingly, aerial-bendingly, licence-confiscatingly
fast. I was racing to land's end, to Provincetown. Why? In some futile way,
I was trying to outrun America.
I had been on a tour of New England, surely the most civilised place in the
US. There is some northern level-headedness here, some Yankee scepticism
that wards off the worst of the nation's looniness. This was not drug-crazed
Miami, gun-ridden Texas, or freeway-maddened Los Angeles. This was the ocean
playground of Cape Cod a few days after Labor Day. The crowds had gone home,
the end-of-summer weather was warm, breezy and luminous, and I felt as if I
were playing truant from school.
And I was, in fact, bent on avoidance of some sort. After a few days on the
road I was feeling numbed. I was fazed by America's vast appetites, by its
endless obsessions. For winning. For snack-food. For real estate. For guns.
For fame. For immoderate, indiscriminate and violent behaviour of all kinds.
I wanted to get away.
Even here, far out in the Atlantic Ocean on this curving spit of sand, there
was no getting away entirely. When I came to the place on US 6 where
Barnstable sat to my left and Hyannis Port directly opposite it on my right,
I gave the accelerator a vigorous stab and surged ahead.
I felt as if I were running a gauntlet. Both places are settings of modern
American mythology, Barnstable being the beach resort town gripped by
submarine terror in the movie Jaws, Hyannis Port being the headquarters of
the Kennedy clan.
Both Barnstable and Hyannis Port stories reach a climax with the central
character - shark in one case and American president in the other - having
their heads blown open. It seems a too common ending to American fables
these days.
It was only in the little town of Wellfleet, 50 miles out on the Cape and
well into the protected Cape Cod National Seashore area that I began to slow
down and calm down. Commercially, Cape Cod leans pretty heavily on its
Puritan-forefathers' past. But out here there was less development - fewer
up-market, colonial-style bed-and-breakfasts displaying American flags and
vengeful bald eagles, fewer 'shoppes' selling over-priced antiques, blown
glass, old-tyme fudge.
In Wellfleet, I sat in the sun on the wooden porch steps of a small general
store, sniffed the sea air, and watched sunburnt kids in shorts zoom up on
bicycles, braking in the gravel in front of the store in a small cloud of
dust. It felt welcoming, something from my own small-town childhood summers.
There was nothing from my childhood summers in Provincetown. 'P-town', as
locals know it, is not big; its year-round population of 3,500 lives for the
most part on two long streets running parallel to the sea at the very tip of
the Cape. But Provincetown is not a year-round kind of place: in the summer
season its population swells to more than 50,000. Even now with the holidays
over, one of the last fine weekends of the summer had drawn crowds to the
Cape.
Nor was there anything conventional about these crowds. Provincetown is the
only place I have visited where there are more single-sex couples wandering
along hand-in-hand than heterosexual couples.
Off I ambled down Commercial Street, through Provincetown's motley
collection of weathered grey clapboard Cape houses, smart boutiques, art
galleries, bars, restaurants, tacky tourist shops and fine old mansions. I
was not sure what to make of it all.
There were great numbers of young, muscular men almost uniformly outfitted
in close-cropped hair, moustaches, loose khaki shorts and heavy construction
boots. Occasionally an outrageously camp transvestite in wig and gold lame
dress would saunter past.
Once I saw a group of four men in work boots and skirts trudge by. And
almost as numerous as the male couples were the female couples; heavy boots
for many of the younger women, too, were de rigueur. 'Deride us at your
peril,' they seemed to warn. 'We are not as defenceless as you might think.'
But in Provincetown, gay capital of the east coast US, such statements are
more a question of fashion than body politics. What impressed me most about
the place was its relaxed, friendly manner, the lack of stress which is
urban America's invisible backdrop.
Saturated in an atmosphere of sexual tolerance, Provincetown seems to have
shucked off the enveloping fear of potential aggression - not just sexual,
but physical, racial, and social as well - that is never far from the
surface in America's public life. Gay or straight, most visitors find
Provincetown, to use that much-laboured word, liberating.
But America remains America, and sexual liberation has its own looniness and
tragedies. That evening I attended a 'Celebration of Life' at the Unitarian
universalist meeting house, a large and lovely old wooden church in the
centre of Provincetown. This was just the curtain raiser to a weekend's
worth of festivities, a defiant kick in the teeth to Aids, the disease that
has carried off a good proportion of Provincetown's gay social and business
community. Where gays have disappeared, lesbians have tended to take their
place. What, I wondered, would earlier and sterner generations of Puritan
New England church-goers have made of the proceedings?
Wild Women of All Sexes, a female percussion ensemble, welcomed celebrants
with a feverish tattoo of African drum rhythms as they filed into church
pews. A long string of coloured ribbons, on each of which we had been
invited to write the name of someone we loved, was stretched over the
pulpit. The Reverend Jennifer Justice, an exuberant young clergywoman,
delivered opening words on the themes of peace, joy, hope, love and the
affirmation of life.
Then came a medley of songs by the Fabulous Dyketones, four butch-looking,
acoustically-correct young women in black leather jackets; Marjorie Conn and
a lesbian love poem to Eleanor Roosevelt; stetson-hatted West End Wendy, who
yodeled her way through When a Cowgirl is Happy; Betsy Sykes, a Buddhist who
distributed paper dragon stamps and instructions on how to burn them while
meditating; Proud Mary, a young man who did a drag queen strip while walking
down the nave to the altar. I could go on, but you have probably got the
general idea by now.
I was not entirely sure that I had; I walked out of church with my head
reeling. What had lead historic Provincetown, the place where the
Mayflower's Pilgrim Fathers had made first landfall before moving on to
Plymouth Rock, to such a curious pass? Surely one had a right to expect a
town of unbendingly conservative moral fibre. I decided to consult a
specialist.
Leona Egan, a writer and local historian, laughed at the idea of a
conventional Provincetown when I met her in her old book and antique shop,
The Ironmonger's. She moved to Provincetown for its flamboyance 17 years
ago, she told me, but it was just as flamboyant a place 70 or 170 years ago
as it is now. Gays and lesbians are just the latest in a long line of
bohemians and non-conventionalists to adopt the tip of Cape Cod as their
own.
'It has something to do with being way out on the periphery, away from the
middle class mainstream of American life,' she told me. 'If you come out
this far, you are looking for something different.'
If Provincetown was traditionally cut off from the mainland by 60 miles of
sand dunes and poor tracks, Egan explained, its role as an international
fishing port in the mid-1800s, when it played host to ships from many
countries, made it all the more liberal, cosmopolitan and tolerant. Economic
decline as a port at the end of the 1800s did not spell its end. While other
small towns along the New England coast - Newport, Nantucket, Martha's
Vineyard, Bar Harbour - became select summer resorts for the wealthy and
influential, Provincetown's isolation and cheap rents drew artists and
intellectuals looking for escape.
The playwright Eugene O'Neill was probably the town's most famous resident,
but he was not the first; a major school of American impressionist art had
established itself here before the turn of the century. Edmund Wilson wrote
here in the 1920s, John Dos Passos in the '30s, Tennessee Williams in the
'40s. But Provincetown has never admired pretensions or highbrow snootiness;
along with the bohemians came yearly waves of summer tourists, the source of
Provincetown's livelihood.
'One must never assume that the art gallery assistant or the waitress who
serves you are simply what they appear to be,' Egan warned. 'All sorts of
talented people find endless inspiration here and do whatever they can to
stay on. This is not just a gay centre, it is one of the most beautiful
coasts in America.'
And so it is. While most of the town gathered at the boat slip to celebrate
the Swim for Life, a mass swim across Provincetown harbour, I celebrated the
beauty of Cape Cod with a bicycle ride past high sand dunes and sedge-lined
tidal flats.
Bike rides and summer days always remind me of simpler, long-gone times. So
relaxed did I become, so forgetful of America's extraordinary extremes, that
by sunset I almost forgot where I was. Only when I arrived at Herring Cove
to find a posse of armed state troopers checking out the Festival of the
Spirit of Happiness - a sort of new-age beach party with drums, costumes and
a lot of hugging - was I reminded.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Travel: Sweet-natured and time-warped - Nigel Andrews visits
Graz, an Austrian town that is closer to Italy than to vibrant Vienna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At 11am the two tall mullioned windows opened. A lederhosened man appeared
in one, holding high a foaming tankard. A dirndl-wearing woman appeared in
the other, clasping a white handkerchief. They danced on the window-ledges
to traditional Austrian tunes. Then, at 11.05, they went back in and the
windows closed.
Such is life in Graz, Austria. These two near-lifesize figures perform this
glockenspiel show - one of the most endearingly dotty in Europe -
twice-daily at 11am and 6pm. For us foreigners, watching it is just one of
those bizarre things we do if we have arrived by design or accident in
Austria's second city.
Graz, we soon discover, is a charmer. It has a bewitching old town and a
no-less bewitching access to surrounding villages landscaped as if by the
production designer of The Sound Of Music.
I had driven to the city from Venice, just to have a roundabout return route
to England after the film festival. Also, my Venice hotelier's wife came
from Graz and had waxed poetic. I booked in at the five-star Grand Hotel
Wiesler, which gazes across the pretty, fast-flowing River Mur into the
onion domes and steeples of the old town and - swivel your eyes to the left
from the Wiesler bay window - up at the majestic Schlossberg. This
inner-city crag is studded with bits of history and architectural oddity,
including what may be the most handsome clock tower in all the
German-speaking countries.
This is not the timepiece that boasts the eccentric dance: that is down in
the mazy town in Glockenspielplatz. The Schlossberg clock is set into a tall
creamy-white four-sided tower and was built so that the time could be read
across the city. It was one of the landmarks saved by the town - expensively
 -when conquering Napoleon made ransom demands. Graz also paid up to save
the elegant 115ft Glockenturm, across the way on the Schlossberg, with its
four-ton Liesl bell.
Graz is embossed with history. It spent 200 years holding out against the
Turks. It was an imperial seat of the Habsburgs from the 14th to 17th
centuries. Later it flourished in the 19th century under Archduke Johann,
who has a fountain named after him in the Hauptplatz.
Yet grandeur in Graz jostles with an endearing laidbackness. I became
convinced, as I puffed up the Schlossberg and down again and then wandered
through the alte stadt, that Napoleon would not have bothered to raze the
place anyway. It has such sweet-naturedness. The winding, imprecise lanes of
the old town match the winding, imprecise lines of the people's faces.
These are conservative Austrians lost in a provincial centre closer to the
wilds of alpine Italy, and to 'the former Yugoslavia', than to vibrant
Vienna. Walking the time-warped streets, you find yourself in a waking sleep
from which you are aroused now and then only by the shrill alarm of a
trolley-car, that silent panther of the streets, as it all but runs you down
in the middle of the road. A Graz citizen once saved my life by hissing a
helpful 'Achtung]'
The old town is a preserved marvel. In the pedestrianised main street, the
Herrengasse, every building has its own history or aesthetic signature. Seek
out Number Three, the 'Painted House', its facade a riot of 18th century
frescoes. Check out the Renaissance Landhaus, with its ornate Italian-style
courtyard; and next door the Landes-Zeughaus (provincial arsenal) with its
16th-17th century armour and weaponry collection: enough guns and swords
(30,000) to stock a Hollywood history epic.
And around the Herrengasse, take in the baroquely stuccoed Haus Luegg and
the threadwork of medieval streets around the Gothic Franziskanerkirche
(Franciscan church). For still-hungry culture vultures there is the
Landesmuseum, stuffed with Brueghels and Cranachs, and with furniture and
objects dating back to the middle ages.
Then take an afternoon off to leave the city altogether. We are of course in
Styria - Austrian, 'Steiermark' - where you expect Julie Andrews to prance
over every hill. Drive out to Thal, the nearest truly rural village, and you
have seldom seen anything so shimmeringly beautiful. The air is clear. The
grass is a hallucinatory green. Cows and horses dapple the flanks of rolling
hills. Plum and chestnut trees sway in late September under the weight of
late-summer produce.
I was lured to Thal by reports of a strange and beautiful church. The Ernst
Fuchs-designed chapel, cresting a gentle hill opposite Thal's only school,
is indeed a stunner. It is built in azure-blue corrugated metal. Its bold,
even kitschy postmodernism - the style is officially titled 'Phantastische
Realismus' - is all the more striking for being attached to a traditional
Austrian-style spire.
Inside, Fuchs has had several brainstorms. The floor and seats are impastoed
with pebbles, making the interior resemble some rioting country stream-bed.
Meanwhile rainbow colours beam from the ceiling and mystical murals (Samuel
Palmer out of Holman Hunt) brood around the altar.
This is not the only landmark Thal offers. If you come out of the church and
stare over the hills you may see, a mile away, a white three-storey house
without a number on it or any distinguishing mark. It sits across from a
hill covered with castle ruins. It is Arnold Schwarzenegger's boyhood home.
Not a lot of people know this: do not tell Arnold, if you meet him, that I
sent you.
Every summer, Thal's large lake, the Thalersee, swarms with visitors and is
heaven to sit by in almost empty September. You clutch a beer and gaze at
the ducks. You think that, good heavens, this was where young Master S first
started limbering up to become a bodybuilder.
Back in Graz, the sky is salmon-pink and copper over the old town and I
saunter out for supper. Seduced by location, I make the mistake of eating at
the foot of the stone stairway zig-zagging up the Schlossberg's sheer west
cliff.
The Cafe Tourist Trap, as we shall call it, serves a piece of rancid shoe
leather 'in the Styrian style'. This means in this case, wrapped in a
garlicky-sweet sauce of rare repulsiveness. Good Styrian food is available,
though, in other cafes and restaurants: one being the Hof Keller.
And you can always look forward to the Hotel Wiesler's buffet breakfast: an
outrageous largesse of bacon, eggs, ham, sausage-meat, cheeses, Danish
pastries, cereals, yoghurts . . . Later, too, I have a Wiesler club
sandwich, which is outstanding. If you have a dressed salad with it you can
taste the local speciality, pumpkinseed oil.
I am beginning to like Graz. But oh dear, it is time to go. The Wiesler will
soon be valet-ing forth my car. I go out for one last mental-snapshot walk
along the Herrengasse and then back over the purling Mur to the Hotel.
I have nearly lost my life to several trams. I have frequently lost my
breath climbing up Navarone-like cliffs. I cannot understand German, at
least as spoken with a Styrian accent. I have no regrets; I shall be
returning to Graz as soon as possible.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Out to prove that Esops are no
fable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The meeting was protracted, tense and in need of light relief. It eventually
arrived. A noisy, difficult shop steward suddenly got up and walked out
saying he wanted no more plans to introduce an employee ownership scheme
into the bus company.
'Unfortunately in the heat of the moment he took the wrong door and ended up
in the broom cupboard,' said Nigel Mason, a director with Capital
Strategies.
'The incident broke the ice perfectly. There was instant hilarity and the
atmosphere changed completely. A few minutes later the man emerged from the
cupboard in a different frame of mind and negotiations were resumed. He
eventually put far more than the minimum investment into the scheme.'
Mason, 35, and his team of eight at Capital Strategies specialise in
employee buy-outs and introducing employee share ownership plans (Esops)
into existing organisations. In spite of being small they claim to be
leaders in the field.
Since the company started in January 1992, Mason and his team have arranged
Esops for organisations ranging from a Scottish paper-making company with
1,400 employees to a 10-man Midlands retailing operation in which the
husband and wife owners wished to relinquish control gradually.
They have advised 10 bus companies on Esop schemes and completed schemes
with six of them. Since the beginning of this year the company, which has
offices in a former print and board warehouse in Shoreditch, London, has
followed a slightly different tack.
'We realised we had pretty well exhausted the bus company market. Our
experience of the private sector showed it to be more diffuse and difficult
to find the right sort of companies to target than public sector
organisations that were making the transition into the private sector, so we
have been looking hard at the latter,' said Leon Boros, finance director.
Boros, 32, and his co-director Ann Tyler, 36, a lawyer, decided to direct
the fourth member of the fee-earning team, Simon Smith, towards a six-month
marketing exercise developing business in the public sector. The company
could afford this. It had a capital base of Pounds 71,000, no borrowings and
a profit at the last year end of almost Pounds 100,000 on a turnover of
Pounds 400,000.
The company believes the exercise has paid off. Smith has been looking hard
at local government services such as waste disposal, accountancy and
financial services, ground maintenance and architectural and planning
services, all of which are now exposed to competitive tender. A solution for
many is to arrange employee buy-outs or joint ventures with employees.
Smith is about to conclude a contract for Capital Strategies to advise one
of the 25 franchisees that will eventually manage segments of the railway
system and, recently, he and Tyler spent two days at Hem Hill colliery,
Stoke-on-Trent, conducting interviews with 150 miners and surface workers
for Coal Investments, which leases four mines from British Coal.
Capital Strategies is about to recruit two new fee-earning staff because of
Smith's work. His efforts, which were non-fee-earning, mean that profits are
likely to dip below the Pounds 100,000 level this year.
'This was to be expected. We now have more support staff and a higher cost
base from which to calculate. From our experiences in this field before we
came together we all know that the likely trading pattern means there will
be one good year and one bad year,' said Mason.
The company's policy is to plough back profits at the end of the year. Its
main obligation is to pay a dividend on the Pounds 35,000 working capital
put up initially by Scott Bader, a long- established employee-owned business
based in Northamptonshire that manufactures synthetic resins.
Scott Bader is chaired by a former joint managing director of British Rail,
Jim O'Brien, who is the non-executive chairman of, and an occasional
part-time consultant for, Capital Strategies.
The four believe employee ownership will grow. 'In the US there are 10,000
Esops representing 12 per cent of the private sector workforce. In this
country, with an economy that works in a broadly comparable way in the
mid-sized sector, there are about 150 companies with more than 50 employees
that are more than 30 per cent owned by employees,' said Mason.
Mason said that in the US figures showed the investment performance of
quoted companies, which were more than 10 per cent employee-owned,
outperformed the main Standard &amp; Poor's US index by more than 25 per cent.
Capital Strategies operates like any other consultant, charging negotiated
fees. For some jobs however they have to accept work on a contingency basis,
which means 'no success: no fee'.
'Our appetite for this kind of more risky work is limited, but we have to be
competitive with some of the big city accountancy firms who will sometimes
take on work of this sort on a contingency basis,' Boros said. 'We have come
to live with risk.'
'However, as we grow, while the risks associated with individual big
projects will get greater, the spread of our portfolio will reduce overall
risk.'
Capital Strategies has recently attracted an investment of Pounds 150,000 in
the company from the Baxi Partnership, the UK's biggest employee-owned
manufacturing company.
Between them Baxi and Scott Bader jointly own 32 per cent of the equity. In
addition Baxi has advanced the money to set up a Pounds 150,000 revolving
loan fund to assist managers and employees to investigate the possibility of
employee buy-outs using the services of Capital Strategies.
The other important activity is the establishment of a Pounds 20m venture
capital fund by means of which institutions would be able to invest in
employee-owned companies.
'We have found part of the finance and we are looking for a professional
fund manager to administer it,' Mason said.
'This will be the first fund in the UK dedicated to employee buy-outs, and
of course the plan is that we shall be able to refer Capital Strategies'
clients to it. It's all part of our plan to convince people that in the UK
Esops are no fable.'

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: A bond boom that went bust - A look
at the rise and fall of pre-revolutionary Russian paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week on these pages, John Thornhill was describing the pitfalls and the
potential pay-offs from investing in the fledgling Moscow Stock Exchange. It
must be one of the most speculative propositions on offer but at least one
merchant bank, Morgan Grenfell, sees potential returns that would match
Tokyo in the 1980s.
But what of people holding Russian stocks and bonds dating from
pre-revolutionary days? How do they stand ?
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Russian government, along with
companies and cities, looked to the west - and, in particular, the UK - for
most of its investment revenue. Bond and share certificates, issued by the
City of St Petersburg or the Moscow-Kiev Railway, have been accumulating
dust in bank vaults and deed boxes in the UK for many decades. Have they any
value ?
Yes - as a collectable. They are a thriving part of scripophily, a term
coined in 1978 following a newspaper competition to find a name for the new
hobby of collecting old bond and share certificates. The craze started in
Germany early in the 1970s and, for a brief period between 1978 and 1981,
was itself the source of a speculative boom comparable with the railway
mania of the 1840s or the Californian gold rush.
Riding the helter-skelter was Stanley Gibbons. This respected stamp dealer
acquired from banks and brokers millions of old share certificates, bonds
and treasury bills and began selling them to the public.
Fuelled by a City boom, it drew in thousands of new collectors who were
persuaded they were acquiring a decorative document that was ideal to cheer
up an office wall and could also be a good investment. Perhaps the
certificates might be redeemed one day; certainly, new collectors in the
frothy market place would force prices up.
Indeed, prices did move up frantically for months. In October 1979 alone,
Gibbons sold Pounds 700,000 worth of material and, at the peak of the boom,
one 1898 Chinese bond was, reputedly, sold for Pounds 15,000. Today, in
perfect condition, it might sell for Pounds 3,000 - for Gibbons had
over-reached itself.
When the collapse came, it was sudden and final. The new management team at
the company considered accepting an offer of Pounds 20,000 for its entire
unsold stock, numbering over 3m documents. In the end, consultant Leslie
Tripp was called in to clear up the mess, and he raised more than Pounds
100,000 by selling the documents around the world to dealers and collectors.
Then, an odd thing happened. In 1986, the Soviet Union, motivated by
perestroika and a wish to join the International Monetary Fund, offered to
redeem the old Russian bonds and shares. Money was unfrozen in British bank
accounts to finance the deal. And while it was thought originally that
holders would receive just 10 per cent of the face value of the documents,
the take-up in the end was not as great as anticipated and they got 54 per
cent.
This meant that anyone who had bought a Pounds 100 Russian bond from Stanley
Gibbons in 1979 for perhaps Pounds 20 would have been able to cash it in for
Pounds 54. China and other east European governments also made
once-and-for-all offers to redeem stock late in the 1980s.
Yet, some speculative opportunities remain. East German cities have not
settled and some of those owning City of Dresden Pounds 100 bonds of 1927,
for example, might get a happy surprise one day - although only if they
bought such certificates in recent years. At the height of the 1980s' boom,
a good example might have cost Pounds 350; recently, they could be obtained
for Pounds 10.
There is also talk that Russia might come to an agreement over
pre-revolutionary shares sold in France, which has boosted prices there.
And, as Fidel Castro ages, US collectors of Cuban bonds and shares are
getting excited about an eventual deal.
To a very great extent, though, the investment element has disappeared
totally from scripophily and dealings have become the passion of just a few
thousand collectors, many of whom work in the City of London or in banking.
Most buyers are looking for an attractive wall decoration. Tripp - who now
runs Scripophily International Promotions and acts as an adviser to
Phillips, which holds three specialist auctions a year in this area - says
typical clients are western oil executives sent to work in Russia who like
to hang share certificates of pre-revolutionary Russian oil companies in
their offices there.
Prices are still very low. An attractive St Petersburg 1913 Pounds 20 bond
can be acquired for Pounds 22: because they are rarer, a Pounds 100 bond
might cost Pounds 40. Condition these days is all important, but many still
are mint.
Russian railway bonds are much collected. At Phillips' auction on October 7,
a lot of 72 railway bonds - including Moscow-Smolensk 1869 and Black
Sea-Kuban 1911 - sold for just over Pounds 500. Three city bonds, including
City of Kiev Pounds 100 of 1914, made less than Pounds 100.
There is little to suggest that certificates will yet again become the
centre of a speculative frenzy. But as capitalism takes hold in Russia,
eastern Europe and even China, millions of potential new collectors of old
shares and bonds will become available.
Even without this extra demand, though, old certificates remain intriguing,
attractive and cheap mementoes of business history.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: No tax on money gifts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My question concerns inheritance and capital gains tax. Can my husband and I
give our children money now - to buy better houses, cars etc - without
paying more tax?
He says any money spent like this is liable for tax but common sense tells
me this cannot be true. After all, it is our money and tax was paid when it
was earned.
If you give shares etc to your children, you will be liable to pay CGT as
though you had sold them to the children at market value. But there will be
no CGT on gifts of money (sterling). In either case, though, there could be
an IHT liability if you were to die within the following seven years.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an
introduction) and IR45 (What happens when someone dies).
We take it all your children are over 18. If not, their income from any
gifts could be taxable as though it were your own.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Challenging an assessment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My company vehicle was bought new in October 1991 for Pounds 16,000 at a
time when the list price was Pounds 19,750. My tax inspector has now issued
revised assessments for the past three tax years.
He maintains that the discount was given at the individual dealer's
discretion, and says dealer discounts are not taken into account when
calculating the market value for tax assessment purposes.
Can I challenge him? I believe many company car drivers may be in a similar
position.
You really have no hope of success in your appeals without professional
assistance. You must also be prepared to go to the House of Lords because
the Revenue is virtually certain to refuse to accept defeat before the
Special Commissioners, the High Court or the Court of Appeal.
The first step is probably a talk with the company's auditors or tax
advisers. You might well decide that the cost of a successful appeal would
probably exceed the amount of tax at stake.
It is on that basis, of course, that the Revenue wins most of its battles
with taxpayers for, despite the Taxpayer's Charter, it uses its financial
strength to discourage objections to its decisions.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Where the Revenue is wrong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1993/94, I had capital gains of Pounds 6,878 and losses of Pounds 2,208,
all after appropriate indexation. In other words, I was Pounds 1,130 below
my annual CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. Thus, I reported chargeable gains
of 'Pounds 5,800 or less'. But I am not clear, after reading several tax
handbooks, whether I can carry the Pounds 1,130 forward to future years.
On the basic point, the Revenue maintains steadfastly that the answer is no.
But we (and other experts) believe that the House of Lords will one day
confirm our reading of the law - namely, that the answer is a qualified yes
(depending upon the amounts of the individual allowable losses).
The practical problem is that few taxpayers can afford to fight the Revenue
up to the House of Lords in order to establish what the law really is (as
distinct from what the Revenue says it is).
A subsidiary point arises if any part of your 'losses of Pounds 2,208'
relates to disposals after November 29 1993. If there were any (apart from
disposals which produced a chargeable gain after indexation relief), you
might like to come back to us with the full facts, figures and dates because
the carry-forward rules for indexation losses are different from those for
allowable losses.
So far as we know, the Revenue's views on carrying forward 1993-94
indexation losses to 1994-95 (only) are the same as our own: it is only on
the carrying forward of allowable losses that we differ (and have indeed
differed since 1965).

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Your CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The table shows CGT indexation allowances for assets sold in September.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the month in which
you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale; the
balance will be your taxable gain or loss. Suppose you bought shares for
Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold them in September 1994 for Pounds
13,000. Multiplying the original cost by the September 1985 figure of 1.519
gives a total of Pounds 9,114.
Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 3,886,
which is within the CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800. If selling shares bought
before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982 figure. The RPI in
September was 145.0.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Trend is down - Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the table shows that many annuity rates have moved up since a month
ago, most competitive providers have reduced theirs, including Generali,
Prudential, Sun Life of Canada, Canada Life and Royal Life.
A few companies have maintained rates but the trend is downwards. Again, the
movement is linked to inflation, this time with indications that inflation
is under control. In the short term, rates should continue to fall.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
TOP ANNUITY RATES
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
An annuity provides a guaranteed income for life in return for a lump
sum investment. The bulk of the fund built up by many types of pension
plan must be used in this way. This week's table shows COMPULSORY
PURCHASE ANNUITY RATES which are used for small company schemes,
additional voluntary contribution plans (AVCs) and free standing AVCs
(FSAVCs) among others.  The rates do not include inflation proofing.

Payments are monthly in arrears, without a guarantee period. Rates are
at 18 October 1994. Figures assume an annuity purchase price of Pounds
75,000 after paying tax free cash of Pounds 25,000 and are shown gross.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Fixed rates gamble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conventional wisdom is under attack in the savings market. As an
illustration, try this two-part quiz:
1. When interest rates are rising, is it a good time to fix your deposit
interest rate?
2. If base rates are 5.75 per cent, should you leave your money with someone
offering up to 12 per cent?
A prudent investor would answer 'no' to both. After all, if interest rates
are increasing, it is better to leave savings free to climb up on the back
of rising base rates. Besides which, if someone is offering a return that
seems too good to be true, it probably is. Yet, a number of high street
banks and building societies are offering comparatively high fixed deposit
rates.
The table, provided by Moneyfacts, shows the most competitive on offer. The
terms are between three to five years, but whether the interest rates end up
being a good deal depends on the behaviour of base rates over the period.
Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg, expects three rises in base rates
 -of half a percentage point each time - by the end of next year. This would
take them to just over 7 per cent. He believes the usual cycle of sharp
interest rate rises is over for now and that the UK economy will have a
lengthy period of relatively low growth.
John Marsland, senior UK economist at UBS, is less optimistic about a low
interest-rate era. While he thinks the economic basics point to base rates
of 7 to 8 per cent next year, he believes the relative weakness of sterling
actually will propel them to 10 per cent by the end of 1995.
Taking a fixed rate is a gamble although those on offer suggest that, even
if you do lose out, it should not be by much. The question remains: which is
best - a flat fixed rate or an escalator bond, paying pre-determined rates
which increase over the term of the investment? In general, the escalator
bonds pay a higher annual rate - but your money is tied up for longer.
The highest annual average of 9.3 per cent gross comes from Julian Hodge, a
small, privately-owned, Cardiff - based bank. For those who prefer building
societies, the annual average rates are 9.2 per cent at Portman or Stroud &amp;
Swindon, 9.08 at Woolwich, and 8.85 at West Bromwich.
The main drawback with fixed-rate deposits is the withdrawal penalties.
Indeed, Woolwich does not allow any early withdrawals on its three-year bond
and none in the first two years of its escalator bond. After that,
withdrawals cost you 90 days' loss of interest.
There are other products offering high fixed rates of interest; the Highest
Rates for your Money table shows the Confederation Bank is paying 9 per cent
on its fixed-rate Tessa. But this is available only to those who put up
Pounds 8,900 (to be drip-fed into a Tessa) compared with just Pounds 500
required by Portman or Stroud &amp; Swindon.
The Tessa has the important advantage of being tax-free as long as capital
is not withdrawn during its five-year term, whereas the fixed-rate bonds are
taxable.
Higher-rate taxpayers may prefer to invest in tax-free National Savings
certificates. The 42nd issue pays a tax-free 5.85 per cent a year compound
when held for five years, a return which is equivalent to an annual 9.75 per
cent gross for a 40 per cent taxpayer.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: A quick guide to doing the splits -
A look at the complications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Split-capital investment trusts are complicated enough to understand at the
best of times, with their multitude of different share classes entitled to
varied portions of capital and income. But recent events have highlighted a
further area of complication: what happens when a split-capital trust is
nearing the end of its life?
Shareholders in Sphere, due to wind up in a year's time, are considering a
bid by Dartmoor, another split-capital investment trust. Meanwhile,
shareholders in Gartmore American Securities, due to wind up in March, voted
this week not to block an extension of the trust's life  - so thwarting an
anonymous American investor (or group) who had worked out a clever plan to
get a larger share of the assets on wind-up.
These situations arise because split-capital trusts have limited lives. When
the trust is created, a provisional wind-up date is written into its legal
structure - usually seven or 10 years away. But this does not mean the trust
will necessarily cease to exist on that date. Fund managers make their
living by charging a percentage on the funds they have under management, so
they are understandably reluctant to wave goodbye to a pool of money if
there is any way they can avoid it.
The main options are: for the fund to be wound up; for its life to be
extended; or for another trust to bid for it. Proposals are made up to a
year in advance, so that shareholders can decide. The most attractive option
for them will depend on which class of share they hold, and their
priorities.
The two most common types of split-capital trust share are zero dividend
preference shares and income shares (or ordinary income shares). Zeros pay
no dividends, but their capital entitlement grows by a fixed amount each
year and is paid out in one go when the trust is wound up. Income shares get
all the trust's income and can yield very highly, but their capital
entitlement is less generous. It often depends on what is left when the
zeros have been repaid.
Income share-holders may not mind carrying on with the same trust, or
accepting a bid from a similar trust, if it gives them a continuing income
stream - but zero-holders are another matter. Zeros are used as financial
planning tools for items such as school fees: investors buy zeros from a
series of different trusts so that lumps of capital become available at
regular intervals. If, rather than winding up, a trust is rolled over, that
could throw out all the careful planning.
Zeros do not usually have voting rights, but trusts usually are structured
to give them a vote if a deal that would affect their fixed cash
entitlement, or its date of payment, is being considered. Most
re-structurings and bids give zero-holders a cash option on or before the
scheduled date.
One exception was the re-structuring last year of the City of Oxford trust,
which made no cash offer to zero-holders when the life of the trust was
extended. At the time, the board explained that because the extended life of
the trust would add value to the shares, zero-holders would do just as well
by selling in the open market after the re-structuring.
While that might have been true in that instance, it will not always be the
case. Indeed, James Hart, a split-capital specialist at broker Olliff &amp;
Partners, says he does not think this approach will be used again as it
caused a lot of bad feeling among shareholders and drew heavy criticism from
fund managers and corporate financiers.
The strategy used by another Gartmore split last year met with more
approval. As Gartmore Value was nearing the end of its life, a newly-created
trust, Gartmore Shared Equity, bid for its shares. This gave investors two
options: to sit tight until wind-up and get their scheduled entitlements, or
swap their shares for others in the very similar new trust.
Most of the income-share holders opted for the new trust, as did a fifth of
the zero-holders, while the rest are still in the rump of Gartmore Value,
which should wind up in January, as scheduled. The new trust also raised
extra cash with a public offer. The success of this scheme could mean it is
imitated by other trusts over the next few years.
The takeover battle for Sphere illustrates a different approach again.
Dartmoor is offering eight of its new income shares for every 25 Sphere
income shares.
The offer has been accepted provisionally by Exeter Fund Managers
(Dartmoor's manager) and Abtrust Fund Managers which, between them, hold
more than half the ordinary shares.
The Sphere board yesterday recommended other shareholders to consider either
retaining their shares in Sphere until the wind-up, or selling them in the
market. It advised accepting the offer for warrants.
Hart also favours holding on to the Sphere shares. He points out that while
Sphere has an international general portfolio, Dartmoor's portfolio of
mainly highly-geared instruments is not such a safe prospect.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Rocky ride for Eurotunnel - Should
shareholders sell, hold on - or even buy? Charles Batchelor reviews the
options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This has been an inauspicious week for Eurotunnel. The company which
operates the Channel tunnel was forced to admit it would miss this year's
revenue forecast by a wide margin, while a Eurostar train taking journalists
to Paris broke down before it even started.
Even so, travellers who make the trip in one of these sleek expresses, or in
the more spartan car shuttles, are in for a pleasant surprise. The ride is
extremely smooth, and the passage from the Kent countryside into the tunnel
marked by the gentlest of slopes.
Shareholders have had a bumpier ride. Floated at 350p in November 1987,
Eurotunnel's shares peaked at Pounds 11.64 in June 1989 and have see-sawed
between Pounds 3 and Pounds 5 for much of the subsequent period. (The bevy
of rights issues complicates comparisons. The adjusted issue price is 267p
and the peak 871p).
In recent months they have fallen steadily, dropping 19p in the past week to
209p yesterday - a recovery from Thursday's all-time low of 199p.
With some City analysts forecasting yet another fund-raising within the next
two years, should shareholders cut their losses and sell, hold on - or even
buy?
On balance, those who bought enough shares in the 1987 and 1990 issues to
qualify for concessions should stay put. Would-be investors should wait a
while because there are signs that the shares still have some way to fall.
Eurotunnel is at a tricky stage. The tunnel has been finished but the
company still has to prove it can operate a reliable service. In the
meantime, the additional safety requirements demanded by the British and
French governments, and the delays of such a massive project, have heaped up
a mountain of debt: Pounds 8bn out of total funds of Pounds 10.5bn.
Two rights issues have diluted the returns to shareholders and the official
starting date for the payment of dividends has been pushed out to 2004. Some
analysts believe it might take longer.
The delays to the start of services will reduce revenues this year and next,
bringing Eurotunnel perilously close to its financing limits. It is likely
that the company will be in technical breach of its covenants by the time
the banks come to re-assess their loan commitments next spring.
Yet, co-chairman Sir Alastair Morton is probably right in thinking that the
banks will turn a blind eye to this. They have no wish to bring the project
tumbling down.
Eurotunnel's forecasts depend on it persuading large numbers of people new
to the cross-Channel market to make the trip. It is also hoping to take away
half of the existing market from the ferries. Analysts doubt whether these
ambitious targets can be met.
Fears of a price war between the ferries and the tunnel have eased recently
but Eurotunnel's revenue forecasts would be hit if hostilities re-opened. It
also faces the problem that much of its debt is at variable rates, making it
vulnerable to any increase in interest rates.
On the plus side, the next few months should see the final solution to the
teething difficulties which have plagued the start-up of services. A rough
winter on the Channel could persuade road hauliers to desert the ferries,
while next spring and summer should see a substantial build-up of tourist
revenues. By the middle of next year, the tunnel will have shown whether it
is going to succeed.
In the absence of dividends, the main reason for existing shareholders to
stay with Eurotunnel is the free travel concessions. The company will not
announce its passenger shuttle fares until the middle of next month but last
January, when it was hoping for a May start to services, it announced fares
ranging from Pounds 125 for a two-day return to Pounds 310 for a mid-summer
peak weekend return.
Shareholders who bought 1,000 shares at 350p each in 1987 are entitled to
two free return trips annually for the 65-year life of Eurotunnel's
operating contract.
New investors are probably best advised to wait because there might be some
way for the shares to fall before revenues pick up next spring. But there is
still the prospect of dilution if the banks insist upon converting some of
their debt to equity in 12 to 24 months. Cautious investors may want to see
the shape of any new financial structure before committing themselves.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Just for women - A look at a new
illness insurance policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The possibility of getting breast or cervical cancer worries many women. So,
a new policy from Pinnacle Insurance which pays a cash sum if they develop
either might seem a good idea.
Called Viva, the women-only policy provides a set level of cover: a cash sum
of Pounds 10,000, followed by 12 monthly payments of Pounds 500, after
diagnosis of breast or cervical cancer. Premiums range from Pounds 7 a month
for those aged 18 to 29, to Pounds 18 monthly between 50 and 59.
Yet, few women reading the promotional leaflet - to be inserted in magazines
 -will realise that, for a slightly higher premium, they could get cover for
all kinds of cancer as well as heart attacks, strokes, multiple sclerosis
and many other serious illnesses.
Critical illness insurance - which is available to both sexes - is one of
the fastest-growing areas of the insurance market but the term is still
unfamiliar to many. The basic idea is to provide a lump sum if a person
develops one of a specified list of serious ailments.
The cash can be used to provide an income (if the victim cannot return to
work) or pay for such things as home alterations, holidays or nursing care.
The illness does not have to be terminal, or stop the insured person
working. More than 90 per cent of claims are for cancer, heart attacks and
strokes.
The insurance is available in a variety of forms: as a stand-alone
protection policy or linked with life assurance, so that the sum assured is
paid either if you die or become ill. Many insurers have now begun to offer
it as an optional extra for mortgage protection policies.
It is also relatively inexpensive. A premium of Pounds 20 a month would buy
a woman aged 29 cover of Pounds 53,125 at Eagle Star, Pounds 43,218 at
Scottish Provident, or Pounds 40,047 at Allied Dunbar. For the same premium,
a woman of 49 would get cover of Pounds 19,318 at Eagle Star, although she
would pay Pounds 26.36 to Allied Dunbar for cover of Pounds 16,000. Men
would pay more, as would smokers. But cover added on to a mortgage is even
cheaper.
Although breast and cervical cancer are the two most emotionally-charged
illnesses women face, Viva is a relatively expensive way of covering them:
it makes more sense to insure against the full range of critical illnesses.
And, rather than buying any kind of financial service directly from a mail
shot or magazine insert, always talk first to an independent financial
adviser.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision this week by Telewest, the UK's largest cable operator, to
proceed with its flotation has come as a welcome relief to a new issue
market that is again dogged by negative news, writes Christopher Price.
Telewest postponed its original float date five months ago, citing difficult
market conditions.
The plan then involved selling a 20 per cent fully-diluted stake through a
placing and intermediaries offer in the US and UK. Such an offer would seek
to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 370m in new money.
There was also a positive debut from Servicair, which came to the market at
135p and went to a first day's premium of 3p.
But Filtronic Comtek, a manufacturer of components for the mobile
telecommunications industry, became the latest market debutant to disappoint
expectations.
Its shares were priced at 105p, valuing the group at Pounds 44.1m. This was
well below forecasts, which had ranged as high as Pounds 60m.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Hepher, managing director of British Telecommunications, has bought
13,918 shares at 363.5p. He is already the largest shareholder on the board,
by a considerable margin, and has just over 145,000. The purchase appears to
have been one of the last opportunities to deal before the closed period.
Directors of Smith New Court, the investment banking house known best for
its market-making arm, have made a considerable amount of money from buying
their own shares over the past two years. In 1994, however, the trend has
been towards selling. The latest disposal was by Philip Kay, who sold 20,000
at 321p.
Conrad Black has bought 1.4m shares in the Telegraph at 330p. In May, he
sold 12.5m at 587p through his Hollinger vehicle - a move that caused
considerable dismay when, in June, the Telegraph announced it would be
cutting its price to meet stiff competition from its principal rival, The
Times. The impact of that price cut had little bearing on interim results
announced in August, but the fall-out will be much more apparent when final
results appear in February.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Bank allays Crest fears - No
pressure on private clients under new system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For private clients becoming anxious before the introduction of the new
Crest system for paperless share settlement, the Bank of England has
reassuring words. It stresses that taking part in Crest is voluntary and
there is nothing to force them to settle their bargains more quickly.
Moreover, investors who want to retain their share certificates will be able
to do so. Even those whose shares are held electronically within Crest will
be able to remove all or part of their holdings from the system in paper
form.
Best of all, active private investors who wish to avail themselves of the
benefits of quick, cheap electronic settlement may join Crest for a fee of
Pounds 25 to Pounds 50 a year.
The extent to which private investors find life different under Crest -
which is due to start operating in the second half of 1996 - will reflect
the extent to which their brokers are prepared to accommodate individual
preferences at a suitable price.
But there are indications already that fierce competition between brokers
means that private clients who shop around are likely to find one willing to
meet their wishes.
Stockbroker Brewin Dolphin, for instance, has offered its nominee service to
clients free of charge since the advent of 10-day rolling settlement in
July, and will continue doing so. This means that those who are prepared to
accept a nominee for their shares, to speed the administration of
transactions, can do so at no extra charge.
Yet, even if a nominee service costs nothing, private investors may be
reluctant to use it because they will not be able to communicate directly
with the companies in which they invest.
'There are two issues about the use of nominees,' says a Crest spokesman.
'First, whether Crest might be able to help brokers communicate details of
beneficial owners to companies; and, two, who should pay for the additional
cost of that communication?'
The Bank of England, which is overseeing the design phase of Crest, points
out that there is no specific requirement for investors to become members of
nominees, and those wishing to retain paper will simply continue to conduct
their transactions with their broker as they have always done.
Active traders, however, may choose to become 'sponsored' members of Crest.
'Being a full member of Crest is a bit unrealistic for most private
clients,' the spokesman says. 'But we think sponsored membership is a viable
option for lots of private clients.'
Sponsorship will allow you to hold shares electronically within Crest in
your own name, and you will continue to appear on each company's share
register. But you will have to designate a full Crest member to act on your
instructions to buy or sell securities.
This choice also will require you to establish a relationship with a bank
through which you can make and receive Crest-related payments.
Private clients should know that the demand for a credit line could well
rise significantly under rolling settlement. Buying and selling two lots of
securities of equal value on the same day might not erase the need for
credit, since you could easily develop an 'intra-day' credit exposure. This
could happen if your order to buy shares settles in the morning, but your
sell order takes until late afternoon.
It is expected that brokers acting as sponsors will help each client arrange
a credit line and it will be possible, under Crest's legal structure, to
allow a lender a legal charge over securities held in Crest in the
investor's name. This should reduce the need for an outright extension of
credit.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: Moss Bros, the clothing retail and hire group, is expected to build
on last year's growth, with interim pre-tax profits rising from Pounds
625,000 to between Pounds 1m-Pounds 1.3m.
TUESDAY: McKechnie, the metals and plastics components group, is heading for
1993-94 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 31m, up from Pounds 24.51m last
time. This would produce earnings per share of 23.8p and should mean at
least a maintained dividend of 14.75p.
TUESDAY: Wolseley, the world's biggest distributor of heating and plumbing
products, is expected to report another year of record profits. Forecasts
range between Pounds 185m and more than Pounds 200m for the year to
end-July, against Pounds 121.1m last time. A strong contribution is expected
from Erb Lumber, the US distributor of lumber and associated products bought
for Pounds 51.1m last August, and the first full-year of Enertech, the
Swedish oil and gas burner-maker.
THURSDAY: Followers of the chemicals sector will be scrutinising ICI's
third-quarter results for evidence that prices of commodity chemicals are
recovering rapidly. The company should show a pre-tax profit comfortably
over Pounds 125m, compared with last year's Pounds 73m.
THURSDAY: Country Casuals, the clothing retailer which lost a fifth of its
market value after a profits warning last month, is forecast to report
interim pre-tax losses of about Pounds 1m.

<TEXT>
Smaller company shares slipped back slightly last week. The Hoare Govett
Smaller Companies Index (capital gains version) dropped 0.3 per cent to
1612.50 over the week to October 20. The previous week it had recouped some
of its losses, rising to 1618.61 on October 13, after falling from 1637.33
on September 29 to 1599.51 on October 6. The index is now down 4.6 per cent
since the start of the year, compared with a 9.3 per cent fall in the
FT-SE-A All Share index.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Only 8 per cent of consumers are willing to pay for financial advice, says a
new survey from market research firm Mintel. Slightly more men than women
feel it worthwhile, and it is older, richer people who are prepared to pay.
In practice a quarter of all people who took financial advice in the 12
months before the survey period asked friends and relations. And a further
21 per cent went to their bank manager, even though none of the clearers
offer independent advice any more. A majority think life assurance is a good
way to save.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies reported a rise in new savings but a fall in mortgage
lending in the wake last month of a half percentage point increase in
interest rates. Net retail receipts were Pounds 322m - the highest monthly
level since May and more than three times the August figure of Pounds 91m.
However, net new commitments for mortgages dropped to Pounds 2.97bn,
compared with Pounds 3.02bn in August. Adrian Coles, director-general of the
Building Societies Association, which released the figures, said that new
savings products may have helped to boost societies' inflow despite tough
competition from National Savings.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: If you're bent on buying, here's how
to do it ..
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For most investors, the cheapest way of buying gilts is through the National
Savings Stock Register, forms for which can be obtained at the post office.
A drawback is that the NSSR is a postal-only service; thus, by the time it
has received your order, prices may have moved against you. But the reverse
can also happen - besides which, price movements over a day or so should not
make all that much difference for long-term holders.
For purchases of under Pounds 250, the NSSR's commission is a standard
Pounds 1. For larger buys, the cost is Pounds 1 plus 50p for every further
Pounds 125 or part thereof. Thus, a Pounds 1,000 purchase of gilts would
cost Pounds 4; a Pounds 10,000 deal would cost Pounds 40.
For sales, the commission is 10p for every Pounds 10 or part thereof if the
proceeds are less than Pounds 100. Between Pounds 100 and Pounds 250, the
rate is Pounds 1; above Pounds 250, the charges work in the same way as for
purchases.
Only Pounds 25,000 of a stock can be bought or sold in one day via the NSSR,
which could cause some problems for large investors. As a result, they may
prefer to deal through a stockbroker.
Unless you are dealing in sums of over Pounds 10,000, a conventional
stockbroker probably will be more expensive that the NSSR; however, you will
be more certain about the price of your gilts and you might be able to
benefit from the broker's advice.
If you do not feel capable of making your own gilt selection, you could buy
into a bond fund. There are around 29 bond unit trusts and, like their
equity relatives, they own a wide spread of stocks - although this does not
eliminate risk. In the 12 months to October 1, the average gilts trust lost
10.4 per cent.
The fund manager's expertise also comes at a price: initial charges can be
up to 6 per cent and annual charges range from 0.5 to 1.5 per cent. These
will obviously reduce investors' income.
Furthermore, while gains on gilts held directly are free of capital gains
tax, gains from gilt unit trusts are not.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The lessons to be learnt from the
gilts fiasco - A look at what happened, and why
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gilt-edged securities often are touted as a 'safe' choice for private
investors. After all, what could be more secure than an investment
guaranteed by the government, paying a fixed income and having a fixed
repayment value?
Those private investors who bought the safety argument for gilts late in
1993 will be laughing hollowly, however. Since January 3, the FT government
securities index has dropped from 107.6 to 91.3, while yields on medium-term
gilts have risen from 6.1 per cent to 8.64 per cent. The total return on
seven to 10-year gilts over the year to October 17 was - 8.07 per cent,
according to Lehman Brothers, and that is before taking account of tax.
The news is not all bad. Investors will realise their loss only if they sell
their gilt holdings at today's prices. Indeed, one of the advantages of
gilts is that, if you hold them until maturity, you are absolutely sure of
your nominal return; those who bought at the start of the year will still
earn 6.1 per cent if they hold on.
This is, however, small comfort; after all, investors could have kept their
money in the building society for the past 10 months, earning a positive
return. But should the falls in bond prices discourage private investors
from holding gilts, or should they see it as a buying opportunity? Returns
on the 10-year gilt, at 8.63 per cent, are still well above those on offer
from a building society.
Many economists argued at the start of 1994 that the 'fundamentals' were
favourable for gilts; in their view, UK inflation was not set to accelerate
and the government was getting its budget deficit under control. So far,
such analysis has been proved right - but the economists' conclusions have
been completely wrong. Gilt investors have had a painful lesson about the
global scale of the bond market.
To understand what has happened to gilts this year, you must look across the
Atlantic. On February 4, the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates
from 3 to 3.25 per cent. The change might have been small in scale but its
effect on sentiment was enormous.
For much of the 1990s, the Fed had been operating a deliberate policy of low
interest rates - both to encourage the US economy to climb out of recession
and to re-build the finances of the US banking system, which were weakened
severely in the debt binge of the late 1980s. Low interest rates let the
banks borrow cheaply and invest the proceeds in higher-yielding bonds.
Banks were not the only ones to spot the profitability of this strategy.
'Hedge' funds, which speculate with borrowed money, also got into the act.
And private investors, dissatisfied at the low rates payable on deposits,
poured money into bond and equity funds.
In the UK and Europe, interest rates also fell early in the 1990s in
response to recession. The same switch of funds from cash to bonds and
equities occurred in the European financial markets, and was reinforced by
US investors looking to diversify overseas. The result was a speculative
bubble which drove the yield on the 30-year US Treasury bond down to 5.78
per cent in October 1993, its lowest level for a generation.
Although the bond market had started to weaken before the increase in US
rates in February, the change in Fed policy proved a watershed. The initial
rise in bond yields meant that those who had been speculating with borrowed
money on ever-falling yields had to move quickly to cut their losses.
Then, too, the Fed move coincided with signs that the European economies
were recovering faster than expected. Inflation, regarded previously as
yesterday's problem, suddenly became seen as tomorrow's danger.
The turn in the bond markets also revealed a more fundamental problem.
Governments round the world had entered the recession with their finances in
an unsatisfactory state; the economic downturn made things worse by cutting
tax revenues and boosting spending on social services. As a result, more
bonds were issued.
While speculators were supporting the market, there was plenty of demand to
meet this extra supply. But Robin Aspinall, analyst at broker Panmure
Gordon, says the problems have come home to roost. 'Last year, an abundance
of liquidity released from (mostly US) cash inundated the bond markets of
the world, delaying and disguising the impact of higher public sector debt
issuance,' he says.
'The heritage of that has been a twin problem: the shock of re-discovering
that supply still matters, combined with the hangover left following the
over-enthusiastic participation in last year's bull run.'
All this had an exaggerated impact on the UK. Investors reasoned that if
inflation was set to return with a vengeance, Britain probably would be
among the victims, partly because of its poor historical record and partly
because its recovery was further advanced than that of its fellow European
countries.
The UK did not help its cause by cutting base rates just four days after the
Fed's first increase. The cut, seen as badly-timed, cast doubts on the
government's will to bring down inflation within the lower half of its 1-4
per cent target range.
Yet, after a long period of both relative and absolute weakness, gilts have
started to revive recently. Markets accepted the argument that the
government's increase in base rates - from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent - was a
pre-emptive strike against inflation. Confidence in the government's new
monetary regime, which places a greater emphasis on the role of the Bank of
England, was in large part restored.
Furthermore, the government is taking action to reduce its budget deficit.
And while the public sector borrowing requirement is forecast to be Pounds
30bn to Pounds 34bn this year, Britain's finances still look a lot healthier
than those of other European countries such as Belgium, Italy and Sweden.
This economic recovery shows genuine signs of being different from its
recent predecessors. Monthly inflation numbers have been consistently below
forecast, culminating in the fall in underlying inflation to 2 per cent in
September, the lowest for 27 years.
And, far from deteriorating, Britain's trade position has been improving
steadily this year. Indeed, Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at
Yamaichi International Europe, thinks the UK is going to be one of the
best-performing bond markets of the next 12 months.
Certainly, at 8.63 per cent, anyone buying the 10-year gilt is getting a
yield which is more than six percentage points higher than the September
inflation figure.
Most economists think inflation will start to rise from now on, but they
differ on whether it will stay within the government's 1-4 per cent target
range. But if you are an income-seeking investor and believe the government
can achieve its target, this seems as good a time to buy gilts as any.
It might be a different story if you are employed and do not need current
income. Since gilts pay most of their return as income, they are not very
tax-efficient, especially for top-rate taxpayers. Any gilt priced above 100
will pay a high income but, if held to maturity, will involve investors in a
capital loss which cannot be offset, for CGT purposes, against gains
elsewhere.
Index-linked gilts are an alternative option for investors seeking capital
gains. Both the maturity value and the interest on such gilts rise in line
with the retail prices index.
But the annual income is quite small - normally, 2 or 2.5 per cent - which
means that the bulk of the return comes in the form of capital gain. Since
this is tax-free, index-linked gilts may appeal to top-rate taxpayers.
Real yields on index-linked gilts are around 3.8 per cent, implying a total
return to investors of around 8 per cent if inflation is 4 per cent.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
GILT ISSUES - BEST VALUE V TAX STATUS
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Your capital gain on a gilt - a UK government bond - is tax free.
However, you pay tax on the interest. Therefore, gilts which deliver a
higher proportion of their total return as capital gain are more tax
efficient, and - other things being equal - more attractive to
higher rate taxpayers.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Markets: A prescription for success - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive of Smiths Industries, has a knack
of producing solid results which slightly exceed market expectations.
Smiths' latest full-year figures, released on Wednesday, were no exception.
Investors, who have grown accustomed to remarkably steady profits in the
early 1990s, will nevertheless have been heartened by the 12 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 117.2m on turnover which grew by 4.6
per cent to Pounds 759.3m.
True, the pre-tax number was flattered by a Pounds 1.4m profit on the sale
of a trade investment, and a Pounds 400,000 profit on property disposal, but
the underlying profit increase was still impressive.
More importantly the results have vindicated Hurn's decision - in the face
of the protracted cyclical downturn in both the civil and military aerospace
markets - to strengthen the group's medical systems business and build a new
'third leg' by expanding its industrial engineering operations. 'The
repositioning of the group's businesses over the past few years has been
dramatic,' says Mustapha Omar, of stockbroker Williams de Broe.
In 1990, 30 per cent of Smiths' US profits came from the medical and
industrial operations; last year, the figure was 60 per cent. For the group
as a whole, operating profits from the medical division exceeded those from
aerospace electronics for the first time in 1993. Last year, they increased
again - by 13 per cent to Pounds 46.6m - while aerospace profits slipped 4
per cent to Pounds 38.9m.
This transformation has been achieved in part through acquisitions. Over the
past two years, the group has spent Pounds 240m on purchases - Pounds 148m
on two large medical equipment companies and Pounds 92m on four smaller
industrial businesses. These have been funded without recourse to
shareholders, thanks mainly to a cash flow of more than Pounds 120m in each
of the past three years. The group ended July with just Pounds 20m net debt.
The acquisitions have, however, had one negative impact on the balance
sheet: goodwill write-offs mean that shareholder funds have fallen from a
1992 peak of Pounds 330m to Pounds 212m. Although this is an accounting
quirk, it could limit the group's room for manoeuvre on future cash
purchases where there is a large goodwill element.
Hurn confirms that Smiths would like to make further acquisitions, and does
not rule out a large deal which might be financed by equity. He also admits
there is little commercial, or even technological, logic linking its
aerospace, medical and industrial operations. If the right offer came along,
he says he would consider selling aerospace.
Cost-cutting ensured that even the aerospace business performed creditably
during the recession. As part of a radical re-structuring, which continues,
its workforce has been reduced by 45 per cent since 1990. As a result,
operating margins have been maintained above the 10 per cent level.
Although the tantalising upturn in the aerospace market seems still to be at
least two years away, Smiths should be positioned well to benefit through
its high level of R&amp;D spending and strong representation on key civil and
military programmes which will come to fruition in the second half of the
1990s.
Before then, some analysts, including Sandy Morris of NatWest Securities,
argue that there are a few more hurdles to jump.
'The most obvious is the need to win the (deal to supply the) flight
management computer systems on the new Boeing 737-700,' says Morris. Smiths
supplies the systems on existing versions of the 737 but faces tough
competition for the new contract.
Nevertheless, from an investor's point of view, most of the potential
appears to be on the upside. Even without an upturn in aerospace, the
group's expanded medical and industrial operations should keep profits
moving ahead.
Analysts expect Smiths to make pre-tax profits of around Pounds 129m this
year, enabling it to continue its progressive dividend policy while
maintaining cover. The shares, which closed the week up 15p at 453p, are
trading on a modest premium to the market.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Markets: Ideas - the very life blood of investment - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillian O'Connor, personal finance editor
Most personal investors will have very different aims from professionals
managing a portfolio of investment trusts. But they can still benefit from
understanding how the market works. This year's investment trust annual from
NatWest Securities* provides many useful insights.
The annual is a self-proclaimed tool for professional investors. Somewhat
apologetically, its 124 pages are devoted to analysing the FT-SE-A
investment trust index, and the proposed new sub-sectors.
Split-capital trusts (see page VI) are excluded from the index and will form
their own group. Conventional trusts will be divided into UK, Europe,
International, Geographic Specialists, and Venture and Development capital.
NatWest gives a mildly barbed welcome to these groupings, but its real
objective is practical rather than academic.
The annual explains to clients how to ensure their portfolios do not lag
behind the index: a 'Bluffer's Guide to Running an Investment Trust
Portfolio'. It also suggests some ways in which the new classifications
system might itself influence the behaviour of investors - and, hence, of
share prices.
The index is dominated disproportionately by a fairly small number of
stocks. Get these 'performance shapers' right and you can expect to stay
fairly close to the index with minimum effort - and invest selectively in
the smaller trusts to try to achieve an outstanding performance. But there
are often hidden barriers to getting the desired 'weightings' in some trusts
because many of the shares are held tightly.
NatWest has - with commendable cautions - produced a list of 'The hardest
stocks to buy'. Top of the list is venture capital trust 3i, the recent
history of which provides a good example of how scarcity can affect a share
price.
One reason it has done so well since it came to the stockmarket this summer
is that half the shares are still held by the big banks. So, professional
investors have had to buy steadily to try to get a holding in the company
proportionate to its status as the largest investment trust - and a FT-SE
100 member, to boot.
Such considerations are quite irrelevant to most personal investors. But
they can take advantage of the tribal totems and customs laid bare in the
annual.
NatWest suggests, for instance, that the splintering of the index could
throw up other funds which are hotly sought-after purely because of their
importance to a sub-index. A speculative buying opportunity?
Another useful concept for the numerate investor is 'cluster analysis'. The
point of this exercise is to find out which trusts within a particular
sector tend to move together.
Professional investors use this kind of information to construct the type of
portfolio they want as efficiently as possible. Why hold six stocks when
three can do the same job? The private investor can use this analysis for
his own purposes.
The fact, say, that a German smaller company trust has been sluggish while a
French equivalent has doubled is very material to the small company addict.
This weak correlation between two seemingly similar trusts does not
necessarily mean that he should avoid the German one - it could be that its
big leap was yet to come - but the divergence is worth investigating. Ideas
are the life blood of investment.
The amount of money invested through authorised UK unit trusts is nearly
Pounds 100bn, roughly five times the market value of all UK investment
trusts. A clutch of top notch stockbrokers publish heavyweight research into
investment trusts. Only one relatively small firm produces serious
qualitative analysis of unit trusts. Odd?
Not really. Investment trust shares are bought mainly by professional
investors, while unit trusts are sold mainly to personal investors.
Professional investors get good comparative analysis free from brokers who
hope to get their business. Private investors foot the bill for the
commission handed over to financial advisers by the unit trust managers
themselves.
Most of the total marketing spend goes on persuading people to buy, not on
researching which unit trusts are worth buying.
But this is not because it does not matter which unit trust you buy. For
example, the latest Emerging Markets annual review from Fund Research shows
wider disparities than ever before. The best global fund rose by 67 per
cent, the worst by just over 6 per cent.
Time for some cluster analysis?

FT  22 OCT 94 / Markets: GM delivers a nasty jolt to share prices - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market's vulnerability to rising interest rates and poor corporate
earnings was there for all to see this week when a sharp hike in bond yields
and unexpectedly disappointing earnings from General Motors sent share
prices tumbling.
Aside from the occasional setback, the Dow Jones industrial average has been
on a steady upward path for most of the past two weeks, and seemed poised to
break through 4,000 thanks primarily to another quarter of strong corporate
earnings.
Yet, on Thursday morning the market received a nasty jolt when GM released
its latest quarterly results and the bond market nosedived on a surprisingly
strong regional economic report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve.
The news from GM was particularly unwelcome, for one of the constants in the
market for most of this troubled year has been the strong performance of the
domestic car manufacturing industry. Earlier this month GM was the subject
of a flattering cover story in Fortune magazine entitled 'Dollars 11bn
Turnaround at GM', and Detroit was basking in the approval of Wall Street.
Thus, it came as a particular shock this week when GM reported net income of
Dollars 552m for the third quarter. At first glance, that looked like an
impressive recovery from the company's loss a year ago of Dollars 112.9m.
The results, however, were skewed by a one-off accounting adjustment which
lifted earnings by Dollars 200m. When that contribution was stripped out,
the figures were a lot less encouraging. Analysts were particularly troubled
by the disappointing performance of GM's international operations, where
profits tumbled 60 per cent to Dollars 240m.
Although GM blamed some of its troubles on two strikes in North America, the
group has clearly been struggling to keep up with demand, and it is still
failing to get control of its costs.
The response from investors to GM's travails was instantaneous. The shares
were sold heavily from the minute the figures were released, and by the end
of the day GM's stock price had dropped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 43 1/8 .
The extent of investors' unhappiness was evident in the extraordinary amount
of selling - turnover was 16.8m shares, almost seven times the normal daily
average. The decline wiped some Dollars 2bn off GM's market value.
The selling was not confined to GM - other auto stocks also took a beating,
with Ford and Chrysler both racking up losses - and was not confined to
Thursday. By late morning Friday, GM shares were down another Dollars 1 3/8
at Dollars 41 5/8 , taking the total loss since the earnings were released
to more than 11 per cent.
If the news from GM was not bad enough, the stock market also took a beating
in the latter half of the week from a sharp rise in bond yields, which edged
towards the dreaded 8 per cent mark. The selling of bonds was triggered by
two sets of data which undermined fixed-income investors' view that the
economy was slowing down sufficiently to dissuade the Fed from raising
interest rates one more time as an precautionary measure against inflation.
The first figures were from the Commerce department, which announced that
housing starts in September jumped 4.4 per cent. The increase took the
annualised rate of housing starts to a 1.5m units, the highest since
December. The second, even more disturbing, set of statistics came from the
Philadelphia Fed, which reported a surge in its index of regional business
activity during October. Especially worrying was the news that prices paid
and received had climbed sharply in the month.
Fresh weakness in the dollar also depressed bond prices this week, and with
them stock prices. In fact, on Friday it was another drop in the US
currency's value which finally pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year
government bond above 8 per cent - the first time long-term interest rates
have been that high since early 1992.
Although some analysts had been predicting a stock market rout if bond
yields went above, and stayed above, 8 per cent, it did not materialise.
Sentiment, however, was clearly affected by the lates upward move in yields.
The rise in long-term rates and GM's unhappy third quarter overshadowed what
was another generally positive week for corporate earnings. IBM reported
third quarter results which comfortably exceeded analysts' forecasts, yet
the computer group's shares fell when the figures were released. The decline
was indicative of two things: it underlined the general malaise of the wider
market, and it proved that 'Big Blue - for decades the bellwether of the
stock market and the country's most eagerly followed company - is no longer
the force it once was.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Markets: Dollar fears unsettle equities - London
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
   Martin Dickson, financial editor
A chill wind from the west - in the form of US currency weakness and
inflation fears - has set a fragile, unhappy, tone in the London equity
market over the past week.
The FT-SE 100 Index began the week with a modest rise, helped by defence
industry bid speculation, but lost its nerve mid-week and fell sharply
yesterday to close down some 74 points on the previous Friday night, at
3032.8.
The main factor unsettling traders in London (and other European centres)
all week was the weakness of the dollar, which fell against most major
currencies on news of a widening US-Japan trade gap and dipped to a two-year
low against sterling, through the psychologically significant barrier of
Dollars 1.60 to the pound.
The weakness of the currency, coupled with revived US inflation concerns,
prompted fears of an early increase in short-term interest rates by the US
Federal Reserve, and a knock-on effect on other markets around the world.
The dollar's decline also had a depressing effect on blue chip British
companies with large dollar-earning interests, because City analysts have
started trimming back their estimates of overseas earnings for many of these
companies. Shares under pressure included Hanson, Grand Metropolitan and
Cadbury Schweppes.
There appears to have been some switching by investors to UK financial
sectors, which are regarded as less vulnerable to the vagaries of global
currency markets.
These trends, however, could throw up some interesting buying opportunities
among international blue chips.
As the equity markets team at SG Warburg Securities points out, the impact
of currency movements has been dampened in recent years because many
companies now base their currency translation calculations on the average
exchange rate prevailing in any year, rather than year-end rates. So many
analysts have now only moved their assumptions about the average rate for
1994 from Dollars 1.50 to Dollars 1.55 - not to Dollars 1.60 or more.
Moreover, there is no longer necessarily a strong correlation between
overseas interests and earnings sensitivity to currency movements, because
many companies can now hedge their currency risk.
In addition, the Warburg team argues that major performance shifts between
British domestic and overseas companies have in the past coincided with
de-synchronised global growth, rather than currency volatility, and at
present all the major world economies seem to be recovering, albeit at
different rates.
Finally, many currency analysts argue that the dollar is due to rally -
although optimists have been arguing that for the past year, and the
currency has instead nose-dived against the D-Mark and Yen.
Domestic British economic factors have also taken their toll on market
sentiment over the past week. The country's dismal record in containing
price rises means the market remains acutely sensitive to any figures
hinting at the possibility of rising inflation.
So a frisson of anxiety ran through the market on Wednesday when September
UK retail sales volumes were stronger than the City expected - even though
much of the growth was in areas subject to heavy price discounting.
Yesterday brought forth statistics for third quarter GDP - a much more
reliable gauge of the economy - and these showed a more comforting, steady
0.7 per cent increase, much in line with analysts' forecasts.
However, that proved little help to the Government gilts market, where the
rally of the past few weeks has been replaced by renewed anxiety over
inflation on both sides of the Atlantic. While many argue that gilts are due
for a strong rally, it is hard to see a short-term change in sentiment,
particularly ahead of next Wednesday's Pounds 2.5bn Bank of England auction.
It is equally hard to see UK stocks making much headway without a drop in
bond yields, given the current jittery market sentiment and the relative
valuation of the fixed income and equity sectors. For example, the yield
ratio - the relationship between the yield on government bonds and on
corporate dividends - stands at around 2.20, broadly in the middle of its
normal range.
Among individual market sectors, the week's more notable share price
movements included a sharp drop in several drug stocks - Glaxo, Wellcome and
SmithKline Beecham - partly because of dollar weakness but also because of a
shift in sentiment away from the sector. SmithKline was also hurt by news
that third quarter US sales of Tagamet, once its best selling anti-ulcer
drug, had collapsed after the expiry of patent protection.
The week's main corporate story centred on GEC, the defence and electronics
group, and its possible strategy responses to the agreed Pounds 478m bid
announced on October 13 by British Aerospace for submarine-maker VSEL.
GEC, BAe's defence industry rival, indicated after the BAe offer that it was
weighing a counter bid for VSEL. But this week market speculation grew that
GEC might bid for BAe itself, driving up that company's share price sharply.
BAe was reported to have told GEC that it would be prepared to resume talks
on merging the defence interests of the two companies, abandoned a year ago,
if GEC did not try to stymie its bid for VSEL. A financier with knowledge of
GEC was in turn quoted as saying that it had decided against a hostile bid
for BAe.
A full GEC bid for BAe certainly looks a long shot, not least because of the
political ructions this would cause. But at the week's end GEC's intentions
were no clearer, and the company was under pressure from the Takeover Panel
to throw some light on a situation almost as uncertain as the outlook for
the dollar.

FT  22 OCT 94 / The Long View: Knowing your limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unlimited liability used to be a curiously old-fashioned sign of a
gentlemanly way of doing business. Now it simply looks like an open
invitation to ungentlemanly litigants. With the current flotation of several
more corporate vehicles for Lloyd's, including Wellington Underwriting and
Matheson Lloyd's Investment Trust, following the earlier group of investment
trusts launched last year, it appears as though these limited liability
vehicles will account for more than a fifth of total capacity at the
troubled London insurance market in 1995.
Before many years have gone by it is likely that the unlimited liabilities
assumed by names for the past centuries will have become a thing of the
past. Many names have, of course, simply been wiped out. The luckier ones
will wonder why they should ever take such risks again.
So much for an ancient tradition - and good riddance too, many ruined
gentlefolk will say. But willingness to back your skill and your reputation
with your entire fortune is a highly laudable feature of any financial
community. It served the City of London well for centuries. Now, however,
unlimited liability is disappearing from Lloyd's as it largely disappeared
from the Stock Exchange a decade ago.
The professions are going the same way: one of the biggest accountancy
firms, KPMG Peat Marwick, believes it has found a way to incorporate its UK
auditing business with limited liability. The well-advised partners at Peats
have no intention of suffering the fate of the less well-served Gooda Walker
names.
Unlimited liability was once much more widespread, for instance among
merchant banks - but Baring Brothers, for example, incorporated a century
ago after its rescue by the Bank of England. Today odd pockets of unlimited
liability still cling on - at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs, and top
stockbrokers Cazenove.
Unlimited liability outlived its relevance in the big global markets many
years ago, when the potential risks began to multiply and US lawyers began
to sharpen their teeth. However, it has persisted because of the privileges
it has bestowed and, in the case of Lloyd's, because the risks were not
understood, at any rate by the Names.
The main attraction has been lack of disclosure. The penalty for the
privilege of limited liability is that your financial affairs must be
revealed to your actual or potential creditors. Limited companies must pay
for expensive annual statutory audits - paradoxically conducted until now by
secretive partnerships of auditors who shrink from public disclosures. There
have also been tax advantages.
Lloyd's expanded steadily in the postwar years because of its plethora of
tax and currency loopholes at a time when wealthy Britons paid 98 per cent
income tax on investment income, and were trapped by foreign exchange
controls.
In the same period, London Stock Exchange firms thrived as unlimited
partnerships so long as the securities markets were closely controlled, with
fixed commissions and a clublike rulebook. Even the jobbers, who accepted
position risk in a way that the brokers did not, traded satisfactorily in a
sheltered environment. Once the markets were opened to international
competition, however, the risks multiplied.
Why did Lloyd's not see the same problem coming? An important problem was
the existence of a layer of agents between the risk-bearers (the Names) and
the market. There was a breach of trust and immense losses resulted. Now,
many ruined Names will suffer the final insult that they will be unable to
participate in the return of the Lloyd's market to profit.
Lloyd's last reported a profit (of Pounds 509m) in 1991, in respect of 1987,
on the three-year accounting system. Then came the losses, reaching over
Pounds 2bn for each of 1990 and 1991. Of course, not all syndicates made
substantial losses. There has been a flight to quality, with the 400-odd
syndicates of 1990 likely to dwindle to 150 or less by 1995.
The corporate capital is obviously being attracted to the best syndicates.
Lloyd's results will anyway have improved out of recognition in the past
couple of years, with the insurance cycle turning round (although it may now
be past its peak). New capital should make a good return so long as it is
successfully ring-fenced from the past problems of Lloyd's, largely related
to asbestosis and pollution.
But the year-old Lloyd's investment trusts, of which there are about a
dozen, have failed to shine so far. The big attraction is that the capital
can work twice over - yielding a normal investment return but also a second
profit from backing the insurance risk. Yet the Lloyd's market remains under
a suspicion. There continue to be fears that the ring-fencing from the 'old
years' will be breached, and Lloyd's 1995 solvency test might yet prove a
tough hurdle.
The kind of unprecedented claims through the US courts that sank so many
Names have also threatened the big firms of accountants. Most are open to
various claims of negligent auditing from aggrieved investors.
It was an anomaly that accountants should have retained unlimited liability
as they grew over decades from small beginnings to global firms auditing
multinational corporations. As with Lloyd's, the risks grew out of
proportion to the available wealth. A prominent American firm, Laventhal &amp;
Horwath, actually ceased trading in 1990, and others remain threatened. Most
of the Big Six US firms have become Delaware limited liability partnerships
during the past few months.
All this, no doubt, is progress. But in the City of London, unlimited
liability once put a premium on the senior partner's nose for probity. Would
old-fashioned partnerships have, for instance, floated quite so many
ill-prepared new issues as have been launched this year? The danger is that
limited liability leads to limited responsibility.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Howe - and why Europe ravaged the Tories: The ultimately
explosive nature of the Thatcher-Howe relationship is explained by
ex-chancellor Lord Lawson in a review of Howe's book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Lord LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conflict of Loyalty, by Geoffrey Howe. (Macmillan, Pounds 25, 736 pages).
Geoffrey Howe has completed the last major ministerial memoir of the
Thatcher era, a substantial book by a substantial political figure. After
Margaret Thatcher it was Geoffrey Howe, her first chancellor and
longest-serving Foreign secretary, who played the most pivotal role in that
remarkable decade. Always readable, warmly human, and characteristically
fair-minded, it is an essential document for future historians.
A fine mind, intellectual conviction, courage, integrity, tenacity,
resilience, great courtesy allied to driving ambition, and a voracious
appetite for work - he tells us that he needed, like his prime minister,
only four hours' sleep a night - combined to make Geoffrey Howe a formidable
minister.
It was his courage and resilience in the face of the most appalling
pressures that most contributed to his success as chancellor. In that
period, he is perhaps best remembered for his brave 1981 Budget, which
increased taxation by Pounds 4bn, in terms of 1981 money, at the very pit of
a recession considerably deeper than the one through which we have recently
passed.
The 1981 Budget came to be seen, along with the Falklands conflict in the
following year, as the watershed in the political fortunes of the Thatcher
government. Not only did it coincide with the end of the economic downturn,
and the start of what was to prove an unusually prolonged upswing, but its
success confounded the government's critics and threw them into disarray.
In his book, Howe is able to debunk the subsequent myth that the Budget was
not really his (and his Treasury colleagues') at all, but one imposed on him
by Number 10.
No similar climacteric punctuated his time as Foreign secretary, where his
patient diplomatic skills were often employed to great effect. Geoffrey came
to love the Foreign Office and his work abroad as Foreign secretary. The
problem lay at home, in the tension between himself and Margaret Thatcher,
which became evident quite early on but which steadily grew in intensity.
That increasing tension, which ultimately led to his explosive resignation
from her government, is the sub-theme of this book.
According to Geoffrey, the deterioration in equality of the Thatcher-Howe
partnership occurred 'not, I think - at least initially - for personal
reasons but largely because of Margaret's profound antipathy for the
(Foreign) Office'.
There is, of course, much truth in this; but it is not, I think, the whole
truth. Margaret Thatcher certainly regarded the Foreign Office as
irredeemably wet, if not actually on the side of the foreigners. But there
was a personality problem, too - and one which went beyond, although it was
compounded by, their unfortunate personal chemistry.
Geoffrey Howe is no wimp. He was, for example, and rightly, an early and
persistent hawk on the trade union issue, which loomed so large during the
1970s and early 1980s. But it remains the case that his political
philosophy, as his own account repeatedly shows, is one based on the values
of consensus, compromise and 'balance'; on a pronounced distaste for what he
describes as theological absolutes; and in which the ultimate accolade for
any particular stance is that it is 'non-doctrinaire'.
The difference between this and Margaret Thatcher's approach to government
needs no underlining. Moreover, Geoffrey's commitment to compromise,
consensus, and 'balance' is held with a passionate intensity. He refers at
one point, for example, to 'the heady, irresponsible, rhetoric of free
collective bargaining' and has an instinctive revulsion against immoderate
rhetoric of any kind.
He was to find what he saw as the crudeness of much of Margaret Thatcher's
rhetoric increasingly distasteful.
This is linked with his fondness for Balfour's dictum that 'democracy is
government by explanation'. Certainly, an important part of the art of
government in a democracy is for the government to explain to the people
precisely what it is doing and why. At the end of the day, it knows that it
will be judged not primarily by s intentions but by the results. Geoffrey's
interpretation of the Balfour dictum, however, goes further than this,
embracing extensive consultation and discussion of every kind, both before
and after decisions are taken. Hence, for example, his devotion, more than
once declared in this book, to the late (and to my mind, unlamented)
National Economic Development Council. He goes so far as to refer to 'the
value of NEDC as a generator of economic innovation and understanding' - a
description which, as a chairman of the NEDC for more than six years, and
with the best will in the world, I find difficult to recognise.
More generally, in the real world, the search for assent before a policy is
put in place can often become a recipe for inaction - indeed, in the modern
world of compulsive leaks, even 'confidential' discussion among colleagues
has to be handled with considerable care if it is not to constitute an
impediment to action.
Thatcher was right to recognise that the art of governing successfully in a
democracy requires strong leadership; and strong leadership cannot allow
quite as high a value to the search for consensus, compromise and 'balance'
as Geoffrey does, any more than it can afford his expansive interpretation
of the need to explain. Sadly, she came to take this recognition too far,
and, as Howe accurately chronicles, towards the end, her style of government
became increasingly, and damagingly, uncollegiate, secretive, authoritarian
and strident. But I have to say that my own practical preference is for the
style of the early Thatcher years, rather than that of the more civilised
Geoffrey Howe - which is perhaps why he accurately describes our close
relationship as that of 'firm friends, if never soulmates'.
Nevertheless, there was enough common ground between Thatcher and Howe, in
terms both of shared beliefs (at one point he describes himself as a
'proto-Thatcherite', which in one sense he was) and shared experiences, to
have made their differences of philosophy and character a strength rather
than a problem, just as the rather greater differences between the
personalities and outlooks of Thatcher and Willie Whitelaw, former
Conservative party chairman, made his counsel all the more valuable to her
and to the government.
That this was not so can be attributed to a number of factors. There was the
bad chemistry, as incontrovertible as it was inexplicable, which led
Thatcher to treat Howe, in personal terms, in a way that became increasingly
intolerable. There was also the fact that, while he kept his very different
instinctive approach to issues fairly well disguised when under siege by
common enemies at the exchequer, once translated to the Foreign Office his
profound commitment to compromise, consensus, and 'balance', chiming as it
did so well with the departmental ethos, became increasingly apparent.
It may be, too, that she believed that he was scheming to supplant her - as
she knew Willie would not and could not do. Most prime ministers, if they
are long enough in office, eventually come to believe they are being
conspired against. As is clear from this book, if Margaret Thatcher did
believe this she was mistaken. Certainly, as Geoffrey Howe makes clear, he
wanted to succeed her as prime minister, but he never plotted to supplant
her.
But the most important contributory factor to the increasingly sour and
ultimately explosive nature of the Thatcher/Howe relationship was almost
certainly their differing views on Europe - the issue over which Geoffrey
was to resign, and the issue which continues to ravage the Conservative
Party in government today.
It is true that he had very nearly resigned more than a year earlier, when
he was dismissed as Foreign secretary in July 1989, in the reshuffle that
followed Geoffrey's and my joint demarche on the eve of the Madrid EC
summit. The draft resignation letter he then wrote, published in this book,
gave as his reason for resigning partly the prime minister's 'lack of
confidence in our continuing partnership' (particularly over Europe) and
partly (shades of the earlier Heseltine resignation) 'my own developing
anxiety at the way in which decisions are taken in the government.'
Thereafter, he continued to brood about resignation, particularly after my
resignation in October that year. But still, he would stillnot, I believe,
have taken that fateful step, which was to prove the final nail in
Thatcher's political coffin, had she not persisted in behaving with reckless
disregard for his position and opinions.
When Howe did eventually resign, there was initially some dispute as to what
the issue between him and Thatcher really was. This uncertainty can be
attributed largely to the lack of frankness in the treatment of the European
issue in their exchange of letters.
When Geoffrey wrote in his formal letter of resignation that 'I am not a
Euro-idealist or federalist', he may or may not have portrayed his true
position. When she replied that: 'We want to play a leading part in Europe
and to be part of the further political, economic and monetary development
of the European Community. We have always been the party of Europe, and will
continue to be so,' she was certainly not portraying hers. In retrospect, it
might have been better if their differences on the issue of Europe had been
properly thrashed out within the government.
The question, essentially, is whether, as the great bulk of the Conservative
Party and indeed the people of this country would hope, there is a viable
and attainable constitution of Europe that falls short of full federal union
 -and, if so, how best to achieve it. That has always been the question. I
remember having a heated argument with Hugh Gaitskell, not long before his
death in 1963, in which he defended his vehement opposition, as leader of
the Labour Party, to Britain's membership of what was then known as the
Common Market, on the grounds that there was no conceivable half-way house.
There is no doubt that any British government has an excruciatingly
difficult hand to play. But the present prime minister could have made his
task significantly less difficult if he had taken two complementary
initiatives.
The first is to undertake that, if in the future (and it clearly could not
in practice come during the lifetime of the present Parliament), the
government were to conclude that the pound sterling should be abandoned in
favour of a single European currency, the question would be so momentous
that it would first be put to the nation in a referendum.
The second initiative would be to support the growing interest, especially
in Germany, for the adoption of a formal written constitution for what is
now the European Union. This should state clearly which powers are reserved
for the union, with everything else remaining with the still sovereign
member states. Since part of the essence of a constitution is that it must
be very difficult indeed to change, this should help end the fear that we
are on an unstoppable federal centralising) express.
Perhaps it is still just not too late for those two commonsense moves to be
taken.
If I have one regret about this important book, it applies equally to
Thatcher's own memoirs. It is sad that most political careers end in
disappointment, or worse, however great the preceding achievement may have
been; and memoirs written (as they must be) at the end tend to be
excessively coloured by that disappointment - as indeed the very title of
this book bears witness.
Yet the truth is that the Thatcher era, in which Howe played a crucial role,
was a remarkable decade: an age of reform, an age of optimism, and an age of
achievement. If there has been a fundamental change for the better in the
centre of gravity of politics in Britain, and the election of Tony Blair as
Leader of the Labour party suggests that there may have been, it is the
decisive break that was made in 1979, and pursued with unflagging resolution
and remarkable success throughout the 1980s, that has brought it about.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Major paves way for start of talks with Sinn Fein: PM
reopens border crossings and ends mainland ban on nationalists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, moved to entrench peace in Northern
Ireland yesterday with an extensive package of confidence building measures.
He announced the government was ready to open exploratory talks with Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, before the end of the year.
In a landmark speech in Belfast in which he confirmed the government's
'working assumption' that the IRA intended a permanent end to violence, Mr
Major disclosed plans for a steady easing of security measures in the
province.
His comments evoked a warm response in Dublin, modest encouragement from the
Ulster Unionists and calls from Sinn Fein for direct negotiations not to be
delayed. But Dr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists, accused Mr
Major of 'caving in' to the IRA.
Mr Major, who is to meet Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, on
Monday, also emphasised his determination to accelerate negotiations on a
new political settlement.
In spite of the refusal of Sinn Fein explicitly to renounce violence for
good, he said, the actions of the Republican movement during its six-week
ceasefire pointed to a permanent end to the violence.
The orders excluding Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness, the two
leading spokesmen for Sinn Fein, from the British mainland were lifted. All
border crossings with the Republic are being reopened.
Declaring that 'from this moment we are in a new phase of the peace
process', the prime minister said measures marked the start of a 'full
return to democratic life'. The aim was 'to make a return to violence
unthinkable'.
Mr Major spelled out plans to create a new Ulster assembly and laid out the
principles that would guide negotiations with the Irish Republic on a
constitutional framework for the province.
His speech included also a commitment to a large-scale initiative to rebuild
the Northern Ireland economy with a concerted effort to encourage inward
investment and substantial European Union aid.
Overall, it marked a carefully balanced effort to reassure the unionist
community of their continuing veto over the province's constitutional future
while meeting the concerns of the nationalist community.
The prime minister's talks with Mr Reynolds are designed to remove the
remaining obstacles to a joint framework document on relations between the
two governments and between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
Mr Major indicated that once the document is completed, the British side
will publish also its ideas for a new, devolved assembly in Northern
Ireland.
The proposed assembly, which would be elected under a system of proportional
voting, would give representation to all differing shades of opinion within
the province.
But in a warning of the difficulties to come, Mr Major said that a lasting
peace could be guaranteed only when the IRA and loyalist groups had
surrendered their guns and explosives. He said the London government
intended to establish a joint approach with Dublin.
Mr Mitchel McLaughlin, northern chairman of Sinn Fein, said he saw 'the
discussion on the political issues as part of the taking the gun out of
Irish politics . . . Clearly there would have to be agreement on political
structures to remove the potential for political violence. That political
violence arose out of a lack of agreement.'

FT  22 OCT 94 / EU averts budget crisis with compromise on fines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union finance ministers reached a compromise yesterday over fines
due from Italy for cheating on its milk production quota.
The settlement resolves the crisis over the union's planned budget increase
and means that enlargement, due to bring in Austria, Finland, Sweden and
Norway next year, can proceed according to plan.
It should also avoid a disruptive delay in the appointment of a new European
Commission next January, which will include nominees from the four candidate
member states, assuming referendums in Sweden and Norway back EU entry.
Failure to proceed with the expansion from 12 to 16, and, as a knock-on
effect, to achieve European parliament ratification of the new Commission,
could have paralysed the union.
The crisis arose because Italy had refused to ratify the increase in EU
revenue agreed two years ago unless it was let off part of its fines for
exceeding the milk quota. Spain, one of the main beneficiaries from
increased union spending, in turn said it would not ratify enlargement
unless the revenue decision was adhered to.
Germany, currently president of the EU and the greatest enthusiast for
expanding the union, effected a compromise that increased the level of fines
on Italy, and to a lesser degree Spain, for breaking quota targets.
Under EU rules, total liability for both countries should have been Ecu4.3bn
(Pounds 3.38bn), but the Commission had halved that to Ecu2.1bn, provoking
the UK to appeal to the European Court of Justice, and prompting outright
opposition from the Netherlands and Denmark.
Total fines on the two were set yesterday at Ecu3.2bn, of which Italy will
pay Ecu1.9bn in four equal instalments between 1995 and 1998.
Significantly, ministers did not vote on yesterday's deal. Mr Theo Waigel,
the German finance minister chairing the meeting, merely announced unanimous
support for proceeding with the revenue increase, and the required majority
for the milk quota compromise.
That enabled the Dutch and Danes to claim they were outvoted. The UK had
been concerned that an overt vote, in which the Netherlands and Denmark
stuck to their guns, and the British government appeared to cave in, would
leave it vulnerable to criticism from Euro-sceptic MPs over the revenue
increase.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, insisted 'there was never a snowball's
chance in Hades of getting over Ecu4bn', in fines even if Britain had won
its case.

The US and North Korea signed an agreement yesterday to relax nuclear
tension in the Korean peninsula in spite of signs of international
reservations about the wisdom of providing financial aid and advanced
technology to a country that continues to flout the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation treaty.
The board of the International Atomic Energy Agency will meet in Vienna next
Tuesday to discuss what it considers the 'troublesome precedent' set by the
accord, under which Pyongyang will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear
programme.
The agency is concerned that there will be a delay of several years before
the agency can have full access to North Korea's nuclear sites, putting it
in non-compliance with the treaty.
Many South Koreans have also expressed reservations about the pact because
the US is felt to have made too many concessions to the North. In a recent
South Korean opinion poll, almost 60 per cent opposed the deal.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the agreement was 'a good deal'
for the US. 'The entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear
weapons,' he said. But the Republican party complained the administration
was rewarding North Korea for violating the non-proliferation treaty.
The framework document signed yesterday in Geneva outlines steps to be taken
by each side, starting with the freeze by North Korea of its existing
nuclear programme and a halt to the construction of two graphite-moderated
nuclear reactors.
The US will begin to form an international consortium to organise and
finance a Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) programme for two 1,000MW light-water
reactors.

Yesterday's rejection of a 7.5 per cent, two-year pay offer by Jaguar
workers appears to provide swift support for the Confederation of British
Industry's warning about rising labour costs. Even if the Jaguar workers'
specific worry about overtime makes it a special case, there are clear signs
that wage growth is picking up. The Jaguar offer follows the recent 10 per
cent, two-year deal at Rover. While settlements in manufacturing have
attracted most attention, several large retailers have also agreed hefty
increases.
Even so, judging by the official statistics there is little cause for alarm.
Though there is quite strong real wage growth, pay increases in
manufacturing are still being outstripped by productivity growth with the
result that unit labour costs are declining. But there are concerns that the
headline pay agreement numbers tend to understate the increase in total
labour costs. Moreover, the likelihood that the increase in employment is
being under-recorded would mean that productivity growth is not as strong as
it looks.
In any case, improvements in productivity should start to slow as the cycle
progresses. Meanwhile, companies like Rover, which cut out all the slack in
the recession, are having to recruit again and an increasing number complain
about skills shortages. That is not to say that rising wages will feed
through swiftly into inflation. But they will put further pressure on
corporate margins, already squeezed by higher raw materials costs and
stagnant output prices.

FT  22 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Brewers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in the UK's leading brewers held their ground this week in spite of
the fall in the overall market. This burst of out-performance reflected
hopes of a wave of mergers leading to rationalisation of the industry.
Rationalisation is clearly desirable. There is 25 per cent overcapacity in
the sector and price pressures are intense. Taking out capacity would give a
reduced number of brewers scope for improving margins. They would be able to
cut production and distribution costs and push through increased prices. An
opportunity for such a shake-up may present itself if Foster's Brewing Group
 -currently reviewing its commitment to the UK - decides that it should sell
Courage. Were Scottish &amp; Newcastle to emerge as the buyer for the UK's
second-biggest brewer, as rumoured in the market, the move could prompt
Allied Domecq to extract itself from its Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture.
Such concentration would significantly boost the industry's profitability.
The government would be bound to look askance at any merger between S&amp;N and
Courage, since the new entity would have a combined market share of 32 per
cent. But that does not mean they should shrink before even testing the
political water. A review of the competition regime, five years after the
introduction of the 'Beer Orders' limiting brewers' ownership of pubs, is
overdue. An S&amp;N move on Courage would be a welcome catalyst to change in the
sector and oblige the government to take a fresh look at the broader
competition issues.

FT  22 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese brokers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's half-year results from the top 20 Japanese broking houses were
as grim as predicted. Only two reported year-on-year increases in earnings,
while 16 posted losses. The primary cause was poor trading volumes on the
Tokyo stock exchange. At the bubble's height, turnover regularly exceeded
Y1,000bn a day. But during the first half of 1994, average volumes scarcely
reached Y360bn. The collapse hit second-tier brokers particularly hard
because equity commissions generate an especially large proportion of their
revenues.
The outlook is bleak. With domestic and foreign investors put off by
uncertain prospects for the economy and corporate sector, the market's
chances of reaching the brokers' predicted daily volumes of Y550bn during
the second half remain remote.
Brokers have responded by cutting costs with an alacrity unusual among
Japanese companies. Numbers employed by the industry have fallen nearly 20
per cent since June 1991. Even so, more radical solutions are required to
reduce capacity and increase demand. The traditionally cautious ministry of
finance may be tempted to create an orderly and gradual rationalisation
through mergers. That is the minimum requirement. Abolition of Tokyo's
system of fixed commissions, which keeps transaction costs artificially
high, could achieve more. In the short term, margins would be reduced. But
in the longer term deregulation would encourage greater efficiency and boost
trading.

Equities have had a bad week. Yesterday's troubles stemmed from the
overnight slide in the dollar and Treasury bond weakness. Earlier in the
week, the culprit was faster-than-expected growth in retail sales. While
both factors are real enough, they need to be seen in context. Retail
volumes do, indeed, appear to be growing rapidly but prices are subdued.
There is little reason to think inflation is running out of control.
Furthermore, yesterday's gross domestic product figures suggest that the
economy is slowing down to the sort of rate that should keep inflationary
pressures at bay for some time.
The dollar's problems are harder to sweep aside. Not only is there a direct
impact on the earnings of companies with large US subsidiaries; the
accompanying rise in Treasury bond yields has had a knock-on effect on
gilts. With gilt yields rising, one would have to be extremely optimistic
about dividends to expect shares to remain unscathed. While dividends should
grow at about 10 per cent both this year and next, it is hard to argue that
such a pace can be kept up after that if inflation really is under control.
The best hopes for equities are therefore either that the dollar recovers or
that gilts break their link with Treasury bonds. At some point, one might
expect the UK to be rewarded for its fiscal and monetary correctness by a
further narrowing of the yield spread between gilts and Treasuries. But
sceptical investors will probably wish to wait at least until next month's
Budget to reassure themselves that the chancellor's virtue has staying
power.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Row brews after pioneer of Euro satellite TV is sacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A row is expected over the future of the Astra satellite television system
after the abrupt dismissal yesterday of Dr Pierre Meyrat, one of the
pioneers of European satellite broadcasting.
The 48-channel system is used by important broadcasters including British
Sky Television.
Societe Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg-based company that
operates it, announced that Mr Meyrat, SES director-general for the past
nine years, 'has been released from his duties'. It said that 'differing
views on the management of SES have led to the arrangement with Dr Meyrat'.
The news could prove a boost for Eutelsat, the rival satellite television
group owned by the main telecommunications operators of Europe. An attempt
in July to oust Dr Meyrat because, it was said, he did not consult widely
enough among the 24-member board was greeted with outrage by large SES
users. They argued stability was vital as the main satellite broadcasters
began to plan moves into digital satellite television, a development that
would cost hundreds of millions of pounds. Eutelsat has ambitious digital
television plans.
Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson, owners of the Financial
Times, and chairman of BSkyB, wrote to Mr Pierre Werner, chairman of SES
warning of 'a serious loss of confidence if Dr Meyrat goes'.
Mr Werner was urged to ensure Dr Meyrat remained director-general for 12 to
24 months and to use the time to find a successor that all parties could
have confidence in. A copy of the letter was sent to Luxembourg's prime
minister.
In reply to another letter of complaint, Mr Werner wrote at the end of July
that Dr Meyrat had the confidence of the board and would continue to chair
the management committee and be responsible for the management of the
company. As Dr Meyrat was approaching retirement age, however, steps needed
to be taken to identify a suitable successor in 'a measured time frame'.
Yesterday's statement said that although Dr Meyrat remained 'at the disposal
of the company' to help ensure 'a smooth transition', the management
committee would run SES on a daily basis.
Mr Celso Azevedo, SES technical director, has been appointed to be acting
chairman of the committee.

FT  22 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow weighed down by weaker
dollar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks suffered more losses yesterday as investors trained a wary eye on
the bond and foreign exchange markets, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 19.85 lower at 3,891.30, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.96 at 464.89.
But the level of the declines obscured the breadth of the market's downturn.
On the NYSE, losers outpaced gainers by more than three to two. Volume was a
fairly heavy 310m shares.
In other leading markets, the Nasdaq composite was 2.86 weaker at 765.38,
while the American composite was off 1.41 at 456.35.
The Dow industrials opened sharply lower, following through on the previous
session's 25-point downturn. There was no fresh economic news released.
Early weakness in the dollar, which was hovering near its postwar lows
against the yen and D-mark during the morning, inspired a new round of
selling on the US Treasury market.
That pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government issue through 8.00
per cent, an important technical barrier, where it remained for most of the
morning. But near midday, bonds recovered a little and the dollar rallied.
The slight improvement enabled stocks to retrace some of their losses, but
the majority were mired in negative territory as a sour mood dominated.
The stream of third-quarter earnings news which had poured into Wall Street
earlier this week slowed yesterday. Positive surprises continued to
outnumber unpleasant ones, but the rewards were parsimonious
Mobil, the first big oil groups to release results, posted net income of
Dollars 1.29 a share, about 7 cents above the consensus forecast of
analysts, but the stock slipped Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 80 1/2 .
General Motors continued to suffer the consequences of a disappointing
third-quarter performance, revealed on Thursday. The car maker's shares fell
a further Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 1/4 after Salomon Brothers cut its
full-year earnings estimate on the company.
Kimberly-Clark dropped a further Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 51, bringing its
losses over two days to nearly 12 per cent. Yesterday Brown Brothers
Harriman downgraded the stock, citing because of disappointing European
earnings.
On the Nasdaq, Summit Technology was marked up Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 34
7/8 after a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee issued a
conditional recommendation for approval of the company's laser treatment for
short-sightedness.
Snapple Beverage surged Dollars 2 3/16 to Dollars 14 on speculation that
either Coca-Cola or PepsiCo would launch a takeover bid.
Canada
Toronto posted moderate losses in light trading following New York to lower
ground on weakness in bonds.
The TSE 300 composite index dropped 34.64 points, or 0.80 per cent, to
4,285.13, with losers over gainers 431 to 293. Volume of 40.62m shares with
a value of CDollars 497.9m were down from Thursday's 64.16m worth CDollars
742.6m. The TSE was down 47.29 points, or 1.09 per cent, on the week.
Overall, 13 of the 14 sub-indexes were down today, led by conglomerates,
consumer products, gold and paper stocks. Only pipelines gained ground.
Brazil
Sao Paulo was down in weak trading with investors concerned that recent
government measures to combat consumer spending and foreign investment show
a lack of direction behind Brazil's economic reform plan.
The Bovespa Index, fell 1,625 points, or 3.4 per cent, to 45,619 points. Rio
de Janeiro lost 480 points, or 2.7 per cent, to 17,006 points on the BVRJ
index.

FT  22 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses shiver as US T-bond
yield tops 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the yield on US T-bonds went over 8 per cent again yesterday, bourses
shivered and Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson said that the US economy
was growing 'way out of control', writes Our Markets Staff.
US inflation was only at mid-trend after its rise from zero to over 3 per
cent so far this year, Mr Edwards maintained; the yield on treasuries could
rise sharply in the near term, he said, and European financial markets
remained vulnerable.
FRANKFURT analysts made some attempts to relate share price movements to the
economic fundamentals - an M3 growth rate slightly above expectations, the
weak dollar and its effect on export margins - but this was mostly talk, as
chemicals and financials moved back to the forefront in the sector rotation
process.
The Dax index fell 47.73 to 2,022.22 on the session, down 4 per cent over
five days after a 7.3 per cent rise in the previous week. In the
post-bourse, the Ibis-indicated Dax hit 2,007.19 before closing 35.55, or
1.5 per cent low at 2,016.606. Turnover fell from DM7.4bn to DM7bn.
Big post-bourse losers included Allianz, Deutsche Bank and Bayernhypo in
financials, and BASF and Hoechst in chemicals, all with falls in the 2 to 3
per cent range.
PARIS closed a disappointing week with a further fall as the market was
depressed by German and US data, which led some institutional investors to
fear that further interest rate rises could be imminent. The CAC-40 index
finished down 25.28 at 1,842.09, off 4.7 per cent on the week.
Generale des Eaux lost FFr21, or nearly 5 per cent, to FFr425 as investors
reacted with disappointment to its 5 per cent rise in first half profits,
while Eurotunnel, which had suffered from negative publicity following
breakdowns of its Eurostar trains, put on FFr1.55 to FFr17.55 on
bargain-hunting.
AMSTERDAM had options volatility to contend with along with outside
influences that beset the continent in general. The AEX index finished down
3.52 at 399.85, after a low of 397, for a loss on the week of 2.2 per cent.
Nedlloyd was among the worst performers on the day, off 4 per cent at Fl
48.90, following news that the EU commission had blocked an agreement
between 15 shipping companies in transatlantic container trade. Analysts
said that this would mean that shipping rates would come down, with a
consequent effect on company earnings.
Gist-Brocades, the consumer goods group, lost 50 cents to Fl 44.40, in line
with the market trend, and in spite of an upgrade by James Capel. The broker
put out a buy note following the company's announcement at the end of
September that it was to get out of the US yeast market, in which it had
been fighting a losing battle with domestic producers since 1988. This, said
Capel, was a brave decision and meant that the group could concentrate on
pursuing its interests in growth markets, particularly in emerging economies
such as India, Egypt and Mexico.
ZURICH continued the retreat that has taken the market 3.0 lower over the
week in a consolidation after last week's gains and in the face of the weak
dollar. The SMI index fell 22.3 to 2,508.6, prompting the expectation that
next week could see it around the 2,480 level at which it found support
during early July and at the start of this month.
The banking sector continued lower, with UBS bearers down another SFr6 to
SFr1,139 and CS Holding losing SFr9 to SFr529.
Hoare Govett recommended a switch from UBS to the relatively weak CS Holding
which it saw as a fundamentally undervalued, high quality investment with
very positive earnings growth prospects.
Roche certificates lost SFr85 to SFr5,590, taking their loss over the week
to 5.9 per cent following the mine month figures on Monday.
MILAN was again depressed by speculative selling of Fiat and the Comit index
lost 1.49 to 617.49, taking the week's loss to 2.7 per cent.
UBS commented that domestic institutions were still reported to be
overweight in Italy and serious buying was unlikely until the BCI index
approached the 580 level. Foreign investors were staying well away and were
unlikely to return until the political scene became brighter.
Fiat finished L50 easier at L6,030, having picked up from a day's low of
L6,030.

FT  22 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei and region
recover from early blows
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
While the upsurge in the yen against the dollar discouraged investors, share
prices managed to recoup some of their early losses thanks to index buying
and the Nikkei finally closed with moderate losses, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225 average fell 92.82 to 19,899.08, a fraction down on the week, after
opening at a high of 19,933.79, and hitting a low of 19,784.86 in the
afternoon. Volume totalled 240m shares against 270m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 9.77 to 1,578.94 while the
Nikkei 300 lost 1.79 to 288.93. Declines led advances by 738 to 250 with 186
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.69 to 1,296.48
High-technology stocks were hit by the strength of the yen. NEC lost Y10 to
Y1,230 and Hitachi declined Y7 to Y990. Matsushita Electric Industrial,
which issued its Y200bn convertible bond yesterday, was hit by supply
concerns and lost Y30 to Y1,580, its fourth consecutive decline. Sega
Enterprises extended its losing streak to seven trading days, falling Y220
to Y4,630.
Drug companies were lower on reports of a cancer drug with critical side
effects, and those named in the reports plunged. Daiichi Pharmaceutical fell
Y70 to Y1,450 and Yakult lost Y80 to Y1,550.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended Tsumura, a Chinese medicine manufacturer,
on reports that the company had fabricated Y1.9bn in sales over three years
to 1992. Tsumura denied the report later. Other drug issues were also hit
with Fujisawa Pharmaceutical down Y50 to Y1,060.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 129.38 to 22,141.94 in volume of 25.5m
shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y150 to Y5,300.
Roundup
Further strength was seen in many of the Pacific Rim markets.
SEOUL was higher in a technical rebound following falls in the previous two
days, but news of the bridge collapse, with the loss of 48 lives hit the
construction sector hard.
The composite index added 6.57 to 1,095.34, but was 0.7 per cent lower on
the week.
Dong Ah Construction, builders of a bridge that collapsed, went limit down,
losing Won1,600 to Won38,400. The news depressed other construction
companies, leaving the construction sub-index 5.65 lower at to 595.75.
TAIPEI made another strong gain to bring its rise on the week to more than 4
per cent. The weighted index closed up 1.2 per cent in heavy trading at
6,839.78., Turnover was TDollars 108.6bn.
Low-priced textiles attracted most buying, with Shinkong Fibre rising by the
7 per cent limit to TDollars 25.80. Steels rose sharply on good profit
prospects, with Kao Hsing Chang and First Copper &amp; Iron both limit up to
TDollars 28.10 and TDollars 28.30.
HONG KONG bounced off lows in late afternoon trade as American and Japanese
investors began buying the heavily weighted HSBC, ahead of next week's
expiry of the October futures contract. The Hang Seng Index closed 50.19
lower at 9,338.59 after seeing an intraday low of 9,291.08. The index fell
2.7 per cent over the week.
HSBC rose 50 cents to HKDollars 90.25 and its Hang Seng Bank unit added 25
cents to HKDollars 55.50.
SINGAPORE property shares provided a fillip to an otherwise dull market and
the Straits Times Industrials index closed 4.80 lower at 2,377.45, little
changed on the week.
DBS Land rose 20 cents to a new high of SDollars 5.20 following speculation
that it would soon launch a property sale at more than SDollars 1,000 per
square feet.
SYDNEY closed broadly higher, helped by a rebound in futures prices amid
expectations of an interest rate rise in the near future.
The All Ordinaries index rose 18.3 to 2,034.6, for a week's gain of 1.4 per
cent.
Speculation continued to focus on when the Reserve Bank would lift interest
rates. Brokers commented that the rate rise was expected in the next few
days, but if it did not emerge the market might fall back on disappointment.
Fairfax rose 11 cents to ADollars 2.80 after the newspaper group said that
it intended to expand its interests into the electronic and digital
technology sector.

FT  22 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Structure and finances depress Madrid
stocks - A look at the bolsa's lack of enthusiasm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that the Spanish market has fallen this year is of comparatively
little concern to investors who have seen the same story elsewhere in
Europe. What worries them is its slow, and apparently unenthusiastic
response when other bourses are on the recovery tack.
One reason is that Madrid's bolsa has been pushed back to the periphery. It
is no longer exotic, a label which stirred interest in the late 1980s, when
Madrid was a sustained target for funds. The bolsa is now altogether too
well known as small, narrow and illiquid.
On a conventional valuation basis, employing price earnings ratios and
yields relative to the bond market, Spanish equities are cheap; but
valuation alone is not enough to propel a market which is seeing plenty of
special pleading for its rivals.
By the same token first half corporate results in Spain have been good, with
at least 50 per cent in line with most estimates, and some 20 per cent
coming out above expectations. In general, earnings have not been
disappointing and Spanish companies, thanks in part to more liberal labour
market laws, are looking trimmer than they have done for a long time.
'But,' says Mr Robert Maxwell of Madrid brokers Maxwell and Espinosa, 'you
are getting far more upside on earnings in France, Germany and the UK than
in Spain.'
The bolsa's notorious lack of industrial stocks makes it particularly
vulnerable in at times when investors sniff a rally. 'We are looking for
results surprises and for cyclical upturns and Spain does not fit into our
strategy for Europe right now,' says Ms Alexandra Perricone of London's
James Capel.
Although Capel has remained remained neutral over Spain since the spring,
with a weighting of 6 per cent in its European portfolio, its strategists
now think that underweighting in the second and third quarters of the year
might been more advisable.
A second reason for the bolsa's persistent gloom is that the government is
doing little, or at least not nearly enough, to whet investors' appetites.
The 1995 budget, which is currently before parliament, has Spain's GDP
growing at 2.8 per cent next year, against 1.7 per cent this year, but it
makes only a timid use of such expansion to tackle the public deficit. The
austerity sentiment is there for the Economy ministry forecasts a reduction
in the deficit from 6.7 per cent of GDP this year to 5.9 per cent in 1995;
but it is at best lukewarm.
More worrying still is the threat of inflation that darkens the Spanish
landscape and with it the fear of an interest rate rebound. If Spain failed
to tame inflation this year, ask analysts, how can it be expected to do so
next year?
In spite of very low growth for the first half of this year, depressed
domestic demand for all of the 12 months, historically low wage settlements
representing salary increases of below 3.5 per cent and persistently very
high unemployment, Spain's headline inflation is expect to end 1994 at
between 4.2 and 4.5 per cent against the initial target of 3.5 per cent for
this year.
A 3.5 per cent inflation rise has been chalked in again for next year and,
unsurprisingly, the sceptics are out in force, particularly because there
will be a major change in the composition of the GDP. According to next
year's budget, growth will be domestic demand led and exports will
contribute a mere 0.1 per cent to the forecast 2.8 per cent GDP rise against
the 1.6 per cent that exports contributed this year.
Analysts are concerned about a string of inflationary factors which have
been built into and around the 1995 budget: a 1 per cent, across the board
rise in Value Added Tax which, according to the Bank of Spain, will
technically increase the CPI by 0.85 per cent; additional tax rises on
tobacco, alcohol and fuel as well as raised telephone charges; a fall in
employers' social security contributions which unions will seek to
recuperate in wage demands; a deflation of personal income tax rates and
witholdings; an indexation of civil servant pay and of pensions.
'It would appear that if the government wanted to write inflation increase
worries into Spain's economy next year, it could not have gone about it
better,' said one foreign bank economist in Madrid.
Utilities, consequently, are being downgraded because the interest cycle is
perceived to have turned; the jury is out on the banks, the other large
component of a bolsa portfolio.
The fact that growth next year will be domestic-led is of little comfort to
Spanish investors, for there are precious few consumer spending stocks; the
retailer, Cortefiel has been a welcome addition this year. It is easier in
Spain to spot and to buy into the export sensitive companies.
Where, then, is the good news to be found?
A more cheerful theme, highlighted recently by Baring International
Investment Management, is that Spain has been wrongly put in the same bag as
Italy and Sweden. This is a mistake, according to Baring's Ms Kate Munday,
because 'when you look at the details Spain does not have a funding
problem'.
The lesson from such a perception is that in Spain's case, the bond market
has over-reacted. Baring, which is betting on the Spanish bond market's
recovery, has moved from being underweight to be being neutral in Spain.

FT  22 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Welsh Water ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Expectations that Welsh Water would spend its Pounds 180m cash pile on
buying back shares were doused yesterday and the shares led the sector down
ahead of the sector's interim reporting season which begins next week.
Welsh held a meeting for industry analysts in which it announced that it
hoped to set up a fund for infrastructure investment in Asia. It also talked
of using its cash pile to expand in the UK and into Czechoslovakia.
This was a blow to analysts who had speculated that it might follow the
buy-back path of the Recs. Welsh shares fell 18 to 635p while North West
dropped 14 to 547p and Severn Trent 12 to 560p and Thames 5 to 518p.
High Street clearing bank Barclays performed strongly as NatWest Securities
upgraded its recommendation and Yamaichi published a very bullish note on
the sector.
NatWest moved its stance to 'add' from 'hold' arguing that worries over its
securities arm BZW were overdone. It added that Barclays had the strongest
dividend paying capacity in the sector and a share buy-back was a
possibility.
Also, Yamaichi cited Barclays as one of its core buys in a sector which the
Japanese securities house believes has more room to rise. The shares gained
2 to 572p.
Elsewhere, Standard Chartered rose 2 to 279p with dealers saying it had had
a meeting with one leading UK marketmaker. And tightly-traded merchant bank
Schroders improved 8 to 1363p with investors said to have been switching
from the non-voting shares.
Transport shares were mixed. Eurotunnel recovered 10 to 209p but British
Airways slipped 5 to 375p ahead of Monday's third-quarter results from
USAir. American Airlines managed bumper results this week but USAir, which
is 25 per cent owned by BA, is thought by analysts to be far less cushioned
against North American competition.
Coats Viyella , the UK's leading textile stock, fell 7 to to 197p after SG
Warburg cut its 1994 profit forecast.
Cashmere jumper company Dawson International was one of the most heavily
traded stocks in London with the overall turnover of 7.2m shares represented
a single deal carried out at 138p a share, early in the morning. There was
some suggestion that PDFM, the fund manger might have been involved, but
other dealers suggested it could have represented the second half of a
tax-related 'bed and breakfast' deal. Dawson closed unchanged at 139p.
Leading pharmaceuticals groups were buoyed by US buying but Zeneca was the
only net gainer on the day. The shares rose 4 to 841p ahead of a
third-quarter trading state ment on Tuesday.
The brewers put most of their takeover hopes to one side, moving down
smartly in line with market in negligible volume.
Greene King put on 2 to 531p as rumours of impending top management changes
gained ground.
Elsewhere in the drinks sector the story was one of dollar led weakness for
groups with big overseas earnings. GrandMet fell 11 to 404p and Allied
Domecq tumbled 13 to 576p.
Hazlewood Foods lost 6 to 122p as substantial line of stock hung over the
market. Dealers said attempts to place up to 5m shares had not been
successful.
Iceland recovered strongly on news that it plans to repurchase 10 per cent
of its equity. The shares moved up from 166p to close 1 lower at 169p.
Activity in Babcock International totalled a massive 16m shares following
the company's move to link up with a consortium set to bid for the entire
Ministry of Defence site at Rosyth in Scotland. Babcock dipped 2 1/4 to 29
1/4 p while Forth Ports, also in the consortium, held steady at 445p.
Vickers gained 2 1/2 to 173p for a two-day rise of more than 5 per cent as
market sentiment towards the luxury car market shrugged off the recent
weakness of the dollar and swung upwards on the back of improving US sales
of Rolls-Royce cars.

FT  22 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP outperforms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK oil major BP was one of the few firm features in the FT-SE 100 list as
some of the larger securities houses stressed their enthusiasm for the stock
ahead of third-quarter figures at the beginning of November.
NatWest Securities, a long-time supporter of the stock, published a sizeable
review of the company and pointed out that the shares had underperformed the
FT-SE-A All-Share Index by 5 per cent since the start of the month. The
house said the recent slide in the dollar had been more than offset by the
rise in the oil price. It added that the third-quarter figures should
reflect a rise of 13 per cent on the previous year's equivalent period
compared to falls of around 9 per cent in US rivals.
Meanwhile, Smith New Court argued that the recent divergence between the UK
and US oil sectors was easily explained by specific factors and that BP
still represented good value. The shares ended the day 5 up at 408p with
5.7m traded.

FT  22 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hint in utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
East Midlands Electricity put on one of the best performances in a strong
sector as speculation swept the market late in the day that the company
might be poised to announce a massive special dividend payment to
shareholders.
The rumour circulating among dealers was that East Midlands would on Monday
reveal a one-off payment of 85p a share. This would be a way of avoiding the
restrictive legislation surrounding a possible share buy-back scheme.
All the regional electricity companies (Recs) received permission to buy
back up to 10 per cent of their shares. However three companies - East
Midlands, Southern and Yorkshire - have so far now bought back any shares.
The Recs have now entered their pre-results closed seasons which means that
neither the company nor its directors may deal in shares until the results
are made public. East Midlands shares rose 8 to 711p.

FT  22 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar weakness takes toll of blue
chip stocks - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Concern over the US dollar dominated the London stock market yesterday, as
City analysts began to count the cost to profits of British companies of the
latest slide in the US currency. Developments closer to home, including the
latest UK gross domestic product numbers and growth numbers for the increase
in M3 money supply figures for Germany, while not helpful, were pushed to
one side.
A further setback was suffered when US bond yield moved above 8 per cent in
early trading yesterday. However, trading volume was not heavy and the
shares rallied quickly in London when Federal bonds steadied late in the UK
trading session.
The worst of the day saw the FT-SE 100 Share Index fall 46.8 to within 17
points of 3,000. The rally towards the close took the FT-SE 100 Index to
3,032.8 for a net loss on the session of 30.4.
Marketmakers were quicker yesterday to mark down share prices across the
full range of the market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which had performed
better than the FT-SE 100 Index earlier in the week, dropped by 22.5 points
to 3,502.4. Business in non-Footsie stocks increased to make up around 62
per cent of the day's total. Private investors, who favour Mid 250 stocks,
have backed away from buying in London this week but appeared to turn
sellers yesterday.
The UK stock market has fallen by around 2.4 per cent this week, largely in
response to the dollar's setback. City analysts calculate that around one
fifth of aggregate profits of the FT-SE 100 listed companies are in dollar
form, and would be hit merely by translation into sterling.
In addition, some analysts stress the danger that the US Federal Reserve may
be forced to protect the dollar by raising key interest rates. The sharp
jump in its business index disclosed on Thursday by the Federal Bank of
Philadelphia appeared to signal serious inflationary pressures and has
focused attention on the statistics on third quarter US GDP due next Friday.
Any rise in rates in the US would increase pressure for similar moves in
Europe.
The fall overnight in both the US currency and bond prices hit British
government bonds at the opening. Gilts eased afresh when a gain of 7.7 per
cent in German M3 money supply for the September quarter was announced, and
brought further weakness in German bonds. The 0.7 per cent rise in UK GDP
was not far from forecasts but tended to confirm views that recovery in the
domestic economy might be softening.
Long-dated UK government bonds extended early losses to show falls ranging
to around  5/8 , with the shorts also easier. By the close of trading when
London was responding to a rally in US markets, losses in UK long gilts had
been trimmed to  9/32 , with the shorts  1/8 off.
Equity business was slow to develop yesterday morning, and the opening fall
of nearly 14 points on the Footsie reflected marking down operations rather
than selling pressure. Further falls in the Index were invariably prompted
by sudden plunges in the stock index futures. This in turn prompted deals in
the underlying equities and Seaq volume increased to show a final total for
the day of 516.2m shares, some 9 per cent up on the previous session.
The London market was subdued at the close when dealers admitted that the
near-term outlook for UK equities now depends on the dollar. Suggestions
that the Federal Reserve might have intervened to help the US currency
yesterday afternoon were left unconfirmed in UK stock market hours. City
analysts have begun to identify London stocks where profits are thought to
be vulnerable to further weakness in the dollar. There have also been signs
that investors are moving towards domestically-orientated stocks, with the
UK banking sector attracting buyers.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar traded nervously yesterday after touching overnight lows in Asian
trading against the D-Mark and the yen, writes Philip Gawith.
Market sentiment towards the US currency remains predominantly negative, but
traders are reluctant to sell the currency aggressively for fear of being
caught out by central bank intervention.
After touching lows of Y96.50 and DM1.4880, the dollar recovered to finish
in London at Y96.995 and DM1.4954.
Elsewhere, the star performer on the exchanges was the Swedish krona, which
finished at SKr4.758 against the D-Mark, after touching SKr4.7330, from
SKr4.774. It was boosted by another referendum poll showing increased
support for EU membership, and hedging strategies adopted by Swedish
exporters, whose dollar receivables are being hit by the falling US
currency.
Sterling was also slightly firmer on the exchanges. The trade weighted index
finished at 80.4 from 80.2. Against the D-Mark, sterling closed at DM2.4345,
from DM2.4325. Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.628 from Dollars
1.62.
Despite the dollar being near record lows, traders reported fairly low
volumes. There were indications, however, that longer-term investors were
starting to re-think their attitude to the currency. Recent weakness has
been mostly caused by short term traders.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said that its
volume analysis showed increased dollar selling. He said medium to long term
investors were getting very nervous about the dollar, especially against the
yen. He said Citibank's client base was underweight in the yen, and probably
neutral in terms of its D-Mark holdings.
One corollary of this is that central bank support for the dollar would be
unlikely to succeed, because the market is wrongly positioned.
Mr Mike Rosenberg, managing director of international fixed income research
at Merrill Lynch in New York, cautioned against dramatising the dollar's
plight. 'This is not a free fall, it is a gradual move down,' he said.
Mr Rosenberg said he doubted whether long-term investors would be making
significant alterations in their currency exposure. '1994 has been a
difficult year, and people are not going to be putting on big positions
now,' he said.
The dollar gained some support from Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury
undersecretary, who said the administration favoured a stronger dollar. In
an effort to undo the damage done on Thursday evening, when treasury
secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen's comments, that the administration would not
intervene to support the dollar, drove it to record lows, he denied there
had been a shift in the US's dollar policy.
Mr Summers said the administration would, when appropriate, be prepared to
intervene in the currency markets.
In its daily operations the Bank of England provided UK money markets with
Pounds 1.325bn assistance, after forecasting a Pounds 1.3bn shortage.
Overnight money traded between 3 3/4 and 5 per cent.
Three month LIBOR was unchanged at 5 15/16 per cent. In the futures markets
the March short sterling contract closed at 92.68 from 92.71.
In Germany, futures lost ground across the board after news that M3 money
supply had grown at an annualised 7.7 per cent in September, above market
forecasts of 6.9-7.5 per cent. This dampened hopes of another cut in German
interest rates.

The short period of reaction in the pepper market following the steep price
rises in September apparently is already behind us, reports Man Producten.
Black pepper prices recovered quickly in India, perhaps because of rather
pessimistic forecasts about the new crop. Prices in the other main producing
area rose in sympathy in spite of the relatively low demand during this past
week. Black pepper faq spot Europe traded yesterday at USDollars 2,625 a
tonne and for prompt shipment from origin at Dollars 2,575 cif. White pepper
prices in Indonesia went up further. Supplies are getting tighter but demand
was rather limited this week. Muntok white faq spot ended at Dollars 3,450 a
tonne.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper reaches 4-year
high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London Metal Exchange prices burst upwards this week taking copper to its
highest level for nearly four years. Aluminium and nickel prices also rose
sharply, respectively to four-year and two-year peaks.
The upward surge was helped by a weakening US dollar, which made base metals
prices look cheaper in other currencies, but was particularly influenced by
investment fund and speculator buying.
This explains in part why metals prices are moving up strongly even though
LME stocks - except copper - are still substantial. The funds are
anticipating strong global economic activity that will translate into high
metals demand.
Since the depressed conditions of last autumn, LME three-month copper prices
have risen by 60 per cent, aluminium by 70 per cent and nickel by 75 per
cent. Some selling and book-squaring ahead of the weekend left prices last
night lower than at Thursday's close. Nevertheless, Copper closed 3 per cent
higher than on Friday last week at USDollars 2,556.50 a tonne, aluminium was
2.7 per cent up at Dollars 1,753.25 a tonne and nickel had advanced by 4.7
per cent to Dollars 6,987.50.
Some analysts suggested there were solid reasons for the surge. Mr Wiktor
Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, said that
first-half demand for aluminium, copper and nickel, had risen by 7 per cent
compared with the same months of 1993, while lead and zinc demand was up by
4 per cent, 'twice as strong as even ardent bulls had predicted'.
Meanwhile, added Mr Bielski, supplies had fallen along with exports from the
former eastern bloc - apart from those of aluminium. Also, some LME stock
was not immediately available because it was tied up by financing deals.
'Sensationally strong' fundamentals would ensure that, even if prices fell
because of profit-taking, they would recover quickly, he insisted.
However, Mr Nick Moore at Ord Minnett, an associate of Jardine Fleming,
warned there was a great deal of moth-balled capacity that producers could
quickly re-activate. 'The market is behaving as if stocks are at critically
low levels and they clearly are not.'
He pointed out that only copper, where stocks represent 5.6 weeks of
consumption, is nearing levels where the stocks-to-consumption ratio is
critical. Lead stocks amounted to more than nine weeks consumption,
aluminium eight weeks, while zinc and nickel have stocks for 17 and 19 weeks
respectively.
Given the size of the stocks, nickel's price rise this week surprised some
observers. However. Mr Heinz Pariser of Heinz H Pariser Alloy Metals &amp; Steel
Market Research, said that nickel demand was likely to grow by 7.7 per cent
to a record 740,000 tonnes this year, leaving the market with a
33,000-tonnes supply shortage.
Meanwhile, coffee prices went on a rollercoaster ride this week as traders
reacted to rain on Brazil's drought-stricken coffee trees and to reports
detailing the extent of damage to the 1995-1996 crop.
Reports from Brazil show that trees previously undamaged by the two frosts
earlier this year are now being affected by drought. After the frosts, the
Brazilian government estimated that the 1995-1996 crop would fall to 15.7m
bags, but current estimates are looking gloomier.
The January futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange ended the week
just over Dollars 150 a tonne higher at Dollars 3,660 a tonne.

FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Volkswagen confirms ousting of
director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The ousting of Mr Werner Schmidt as Volkswagen's finance director was
confirmed yesterday by the German car company, though it gave no reason for
the widely expected decision which has been linked to heavy losses at VW's
Seat subsidiary in Spain.
After a meeting of its supervisory board, the non-executive board which
decides top management appointments, VW said Mr Schmidt, 62, would step down
at the end of the year. He would continue to advise the company on a
consultancy basis. VW officials said Mr Schmidt was not going because of the
Seat problems, though they gave no other reason.
Last year, Seat nearly collapsed, making an unexpected loss of DM1.8bn
(Dollars 1.2bn). Seat's chairman, Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, was sacked
last autumn; the rest of the top management has since been replaced. Mr
Schmidt was head of Seat's supervisory board for five years up to mid-1991.
He has again been on this board since June, 1993.
Mr Schmidt, with the group for 27 years (including 19 on the board), was not
one of chairman Mr Ferdinand Piech's close associates. Relations have been
cool since Mr Piech became head of the group at the start of 1993. His
determination to remove Mr Schmidt - whose career has included spells as
head of exports, chairman of VW in Brazil and head of Audi, the executive
car subsidiary - may have been reinforced by an auditor's report by the
Arthur Andersen accountancy concern on how the Seat losses occurred.
VW said yesterday it intended to implement recommendations by Andersen to
tighten up its financial controls. Following Mr Schmidt's departure, Mr
Bruno Adelt will become board member for financial controlling and
accounting and Mr Jens Neumann, the director responsible for group strategy
will add the group treasury function to his activities.

FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sapporo to end 11-year link with
US brewer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sapporo Breweries, the third largest of Japan's four main beer companies,
plans to end its 11-year-old distribution deal with Miller Brewing of the
US.
Sapporo wishes to end its exclusive partnership with Miller, a unit of
Philip Morris, to free itself to distribute a wider range of foreign beers,
the Japanese brewer said.
The present contract restricts Sapporo to selling Miller's and no other
foreign beer, a disadvantage to the Japanese partner at a time when beer
imports to Japan are rising fast. The pair had come to an amicable agreement
to end their partnership within the year, Sapporo said.
Foreign beer sales in Japan multiplied five-fold in the first half,
propelled by the ease with which the yen's strength allows them to undercut
Japanese beer prices. There has been a shift in consumer taste, and decline
in brand loyalty.
Even after their fast growth, beer imports take only a 3 per cent market
share, compared with Sapporo's 18.5 per cent. But the growth in competition
has been enough to trigger a beer price war and oblige brewers to review
their distribution and production arrangements.

FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Poor sales hold back Kellogg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another quarter of poor sales in the US held back profits growth at Kellogg,
the US breakfast cereal maker, in the three months to September. Net income
rose 4 per cent to Dollars 216.7m from Dollars 209.3m, lifting earnings per
share to 96 cents from 90 cents.
Kellogg said US cereal volumes were hit because it reduced promotional
spending on money-off coupons. However, it said the setback was more than
offset by solid results from Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific
region. Sales rose 4 per cent to Dollars 1.74bn.
Kellogg, like other manufacturers of premium cereal brands, has been
fighting tough competition in its home market from cheaper products and
own-label brands. Earlier this year General Mills, Kellogg's biggest
competitor, switched strategy by reigning in promotional spending and
cutting prices by 11 per cent.
Kellogg has cut promotional spending, but is reluctant to win back market
share by cutting prices. Instead, it is using the money saved on promotions
to increase advertising.
Mr Arnold Langbo, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We are monitoring the
situation carefully, but continue to believe that the best way to achieve
long-term profitable growth is by introducing successful new products and
investing in brand-building advertising.'
One factor that should have helped Kellogg's US sales was the disruption
that hit General Mills when it discovered its cereals had been treated with
an unauthorised pesticide and had to throw away 50m boxes of cereal.
Kellogg has focused on growth overseas: 'We are particularly pleased that we
achieved volume growth in virtually every developing market around the
world, and are encouraged by the initial response to our products by
consumers in India, our newest market,' Mr Langbo said.

FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: American Brands lifted by
cigarette operations
</HEADLINE>

A big increase in profits from cigarettes helped American Brands, the US
consumer products group, lift net income 79 per cent to Dollars 152m in the
third quarter, the company reported yesterday.
Like Philip Morris, which reported earlier in the week, American Brands
benefited from a favourable comparison with a year in which US cigarette
makers were badly hit by a bout of price cutting in their domestic market.
American Tobacco, the group's cigarette manufacturing operation, contributed
operating profits of Dollars 49m compared with a loss of Dollars 35m last
time. The prior year's losses included a Dollars 30m restructuring
provision.
Earlier this year, American Brands agreed to sell American Tobacco to BAT
Industries of the UK, for Dollars 1bn, but the sale is undergoing an
anti-trust review by the Federal Trade Commission because BAT owns Brown &amp;
Williamson, the third biggest US tobacco group.
Group revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn and operating profits rose
39 per cent to Dollars 345.4m. Earnings per share rose to 75 cents from 42
cents helped by a reduction in the tax charge to 42 per cent from 47 per
cent.
Mr William Alley, chairman and chief executive, said the company had
experienced broad gains across most of its operations. Gallaher Tobacco, the
UK's biggest cigarette company, increased its contribution by 5 per cent
even though last year's third-quarter benefited from trade buying in advance
of an August 1993 price increase.
Non-tobacco operations increased their contribution to operating profits by
6 per cent to a record Dollars 182.5m.
The group saw double-digit increases from distilled spirits and from each of
the businesses described by American Brands as long-term growth operations:
hardware and home improvement products, office products and golfing
equipment.

FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Workers will own Digital unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German subsidiary of Digital Equipment, the loss-making US computer
maker, is establishing an independent, employee-owned company to provide
continued employment for about 1,500 staff. The unit is being forced to sack
them as part of its restructuring measures.
The new company, Mitarbeitergesellschaft (Employee-owned Company) or MAG
will be set up in Munich. Employees transferring to the new company will
have their length of service recognised by the new company in addition to
their salaries, fringe benefits and retirement schemes.
Mr Klaus Lutz, personnel director for Digital Deutschland, and Mr Dieter
Jung, chairman of the company's works council said the initiative was: 'An
innovative way of securing employment'.
The plan was approved yesterday by Digital Deutschland, the German trade
unions and the local works council.
MAG's initial business will come from Digital Deutschland. It will be free
to market products and services in areas of the computer business where
Digital no longer intends to operate. It will be free to open up new markets
on its own initiative. The only constraint will be that the company should
not compete directly with Digital.

FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Japan's brokers stall at halfway
 -Securities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Interim earnings at Japan's leading brokers were held back by
lower-than-expected stock market volume which resulted in reduced stock
broking commissions. Most securities houses had expected average daily
turnover to total about Y400bn (Dollars 4.1bn) for the first half to
September, but brokerage officials said the actual figure had been about
Y350bn, down 15 per cent from a year earlier.
They also blamed the reduction in bond trading profits due to the bond
market fall earlier this year.
In spite of reduced costs, the fall in revenues hit all brokers, with only
four - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Kosei
Securities - out of the top 20 managing to avoid losses on the after-tax
profit level.
Salomon Brothers in Tokyo said equity brokerage commissions declined by 20.4
per cent for the top 20 brokers. Underwriting commissions were up 38.2 per
cent while gains from stock and bond trading fell 60 per cent.
At Nomura, the industry leader, income from stock brokerage commission fell
14.6 per cent to Y51.2bn, while underwriting commissions rose 3.8 times to
Y11.5m thanks to active convertible bond issuance.
For the full year to next March, the company expects a 38 per cent rise in
recurring profits to Y70bn on a 3 per cent increase in operating income to
Y410bn.
Daiwa's stock brokerage commission income fell 25.1 per cent to Y36.8bn and
stock underwriting commission income fell 11.4 per cent to Y2.6bn.
For the full year, the company forecasts a 23 per cent decline in recurring
profits to Y40bn and an 8 per cent fall in revenue to Y273bn.
Nikko saw its stock brokerage commissions fall 20.8 per cent to Y38.7bn but
stock underwriting commissions rose 2.4 times to Y7.3bn.
The group expects recurring profits to fall 14 per cent for the full year to
Y30bn on a 7 per cent decline in operating income to Y260bn.
Yamaichi posted a 22.7 per cent drop in stock brokerage commissions while
stock underwriting commissions rose 3.6 times.
For the full year, the company expects a 27 per cent fall in recurring
profits to Y13bn and a 3 per cent reduction in operating revenues to Y228bn.
The smaller brokers, which rely more heavily on stock brokerage commissions
from retail clients were especially hard hit by the sluggish market volume
and the inactivity among individual investors. Sanyo Securities, which faced
an erosion of its market share posted a recurring loss of Y13.5bn, while New
Japan, Wako, and Okasan which managed to return to the black for the year to
last March, fell back into the red.
Of the 10 second-tier brokers, only Sanyo and Kankaku are forecasting losses
on the recurring level. However, since the estimates are based on
projections that average daily turnover will total Y400bn-Y450bn, analysts
expect many of the other smaller brokers may not achieve their forecasts.

FT  22 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hochtief stalks Holzmann stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LINDEMANN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Hochtief, Germany's second largest construction company, may try to get a
controlling stake in Philipp Holzmann, if its larger rival does not
co-operate with efforts to co-ordinate their foreign operations.
Mr Hans-Peter Keitel, Hochtief's chief executive, said his company would
need a shareholding of about 40 per cent to control voting at Holzmann
shareholder meetings where usually a maximum of 80 per cent of the shares
are represented.
However, he said he would not push for a full merger of the two groups which
would remain competitors in the German market.
In mid-September, Hochtief said it would raise its 18.7 per cent in Holzmann
by buying a further 10 per cent from BfG Bank. Mr Keitel said since then
Holzmann had made what he called an 'emotional' rejection of any ideas of
co-operation.
Hochtief's increased stake is being reviewed by the Federal Cartel Office
which is examining a range of different markets, from tunnel boring to
bridge building, to see whether competition would be distorted.
The review is not likely to be completed until mid-January. However, if
Hochtief wins approval to go over the key 25 per cent share threshold which
allows it to block supervisory board decisions there are no reasons why
Hochtief could not raise its stake to 49.9 per cent.
Hochtief is likely to be able to pick up the 5 per cent stake held by
Commerzbank, the group's house bank, but it is unclear where it will find
the outstanding shares.
Deutsche Bank, with 25.9 per cent, is the largest of Holzmann's
shareholders. Yesterday it refused to say whether it would sell any of its
shares.
'We are observing the situation and must wait for signals from the
monopolies authority,' the bank said.
Holzman said institutional investors held about 9 per cent of the company
and that the balance was held by small shareholders, many of whom do not
attend meetings.
Since Hochtief unveiled its strategy, Mr Lothar Mayer, Holzmann's chief
executive, has said he wanted the company to remain independent. It is
likely that he will try to persuade Deutsche Bank not to sell its shares. He
will argue that if Hochtief wins control it would give RWE, which owns
Hochtief and is also the country's largest utility, a too powerful position
in Germany.
Deutsche said earlier this year it would reduce its shareholdings in a
number of German companies and use the money to buy stakes in international
companies. It hinted that it did not regard its Holzmann holding as a
strategic investment by refusing to participate in a rights issue last year.
Hochtief has a turnover of about DM8bn (Dollars 5.1bn), less than Holzmann's
DM12.4bn, but is considerably more profitable, reporting earnings last year
of DM122m compared with Holzmann's DM106m.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pearson in Pounds 52m magazines deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pearson, the media, information and entertainment group, is moving into the
general magazine business for the first time with the Pounds 52.5m purchase
of Future Publishing.
The company, which was founded in 1985, produces 30 magazines in the
computer and consumer field and is about to launch a new title on the
Internet.
The deal is an early coup for Mr Nick Alexander, who has recently joined
Pearson, the publishing interests of which include the Financial Times, with
the task of creating a magazine and consumer division.
Future Publishing, was launched with about Pounds 30,000 by Mr Chris
Anderson, who edited the VNU title Personal Computer Games before setting up
his own in a room of his home in Somerton, Devon.
The first magazine, Amstrad Action, was laid out on his kitchen table.
Mr Anderson, who has appeared in lists of the UK's richest people, still
owns about 93 per cent of the company and plans to use the money raised to
concentrate on a similar style of magazine publishing in the US.
The deal with Pearson has been agreed, although the last legal details will
be finalised over the weekend together with formal signing.
An announcement to the Stock Exchange is expected on Monday morning.
Future is perhaps best known for its computer titles such as Amigo Format
and PC Plus but the company has since developed 10 consumer magazines
ranging from surprising hits such as Needlecraft to Mountain Biking UK and
Classic CD.
One of the group's best known features has been its liberal use of free
gifts which are an integral part of the magazine, such as games, software
and demonstration CDs.
The group, which is based in Bath, employs some 400 people and had a
turnover of Pounds 41m and profits of Pounds 2.3m in the year to April 1993.
The purchase is the latest example of Pearson's strategic decision to turn
itself from a conglomerate into a media, information and entertainment
company.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: High Point loss little changed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The expected return to profitability at High-Point, the engineering and
consultancy group, failed to materialise and there was a marginally
increased full-year pre-tax loss of Pounds 442,000, against Pounds 440,000.
The shares fell 9p to 46p.
The figure, which Mr Peter Johnson, chairman, described as 'disappointing',
came from turnover of Pounds 43.2m (Pounds 48.6m) for the year to May 31.
The 1993 loss was, however, struck after a profit of Pounds 955,000 on the
disposal of discontinued operations.
Interest charges took Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 1.59m) as borrowings remained
'unacceptably high'.
After tax of Pounds 118,000 (Pounds 2,000) losses per share deepened to
11.5p (8.6p). The proposed dividend is maintained at 0.5p.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: EVC institutions reject claims by
Greenpeace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
City institutions handling the imminent flotation of EVC International,
Europe's largest PVC manufacturer, yesterday rejected claims that they had
over-valued the company and failed to warn potential investors of
environmental risks.
SG Warburg and Kleinwort Benson both accused Greenpeace, the environmental
pressure group, of using selective and distorted facts in a circular urging
fund managers to avoid the float, which is expected to value the company at
more than Pounds 400m.
In its first-ever approach to institutional investors, Greenpeace criticised
research on EVC by Warburg, joint global co-ordinator to the placing and
open offer, and Kleinwort Benson, lead manager on the issue.
'A valuation of EVC made on the basis of these reports would, in our view,
overstate the company's worth,' Greenpeace said.
The Dutch-based company, jointly-owned by ICI and Enichem of Italy, will
unveil its flotation price tag on Monday when its pathfinder prospectus is
published.
Researchers at Greenpeace, however, warned that the newly floated company
would face mounting environmental and safety pressures, prompted by concerns
over dioxins and other toxic emissions during PVC production.
'The increasing availability of viable substitutes will erode traditional
PVC markets in Europe and the US,' the pressure group added.
Warburg, which described the environmental pressures on EVC as 'limited',
said it stood by its views and was confident of support from fund managers.
Officials at Kleinwort, meanwhile, said: 'We have never glossed over the
environmental controversy surrounding PVC. But our tentative view is that
these pressures are past their worst.'
Environmental concerns and restrictions on the use of PVC, particularly in
packaging, contributed to combined pre-tax losses of Fl 827m (Pounds 304m)
at EVC over the last three years.
Although cost cutting is understood to have improved the joint venture's
financial performance in recent months, ICI - which publishes its
third-quarter results next Thursday - is expected to endure a Pounds 125m
write-down on its EVC assets in the final quarter.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Sphere board recommends bid rejection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Sphere Investment Trust yesterday advised shareholders not to
accept an offer from Dartmoor Investment Trust.
It recommended retaining the shares, or selling them in the market. Warrant
holders were advised to accept a separate offer for their warrants.
Dartmoor is offering eight new income shares for every 25 Sphere income and
residual capital shares. It has received provisional acceptances for more
than 52 per cent of the shares, held by itself, its managers, Exeter, and
Abtrust Fund Managers.
Sphere's board said it did not believe this was a fair or reasonable offer
for the shares, but acknowledged it was likely that the bid would become
unconditional.
Its recommendation was based on assurances from Dartmoor that Sphere would
continue as a separately quoted trust, retaining the same managers, with a
broadly equivalent portfolio to the past, until it was liquidated as
scheduled, or rolled over into a successor trust.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BCE moves into electronic games with Pounds
14m purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in BCE Holdings were suspended yesterday at 9 1/2 p, after the
announcement of a deal that will take the snooker and pool products
distributor into the electronic games industry and more than treble its
size.
The USM-traded group, which has a market capitalisation of just under Pounds
6m, has agreed in principle to acquire for Pounds 14m Rage Software and
another similar company involved in the development of video and computer
games.
Mr Robin Jones, managing director, said that the two companies, which
together employ about 100 people, had developed games that had sold hundreds
of thousands of copies. One of Rage's most successful products was Striker,
a football game.
Mr Jones and a partner bought into BCE from former chairman Mr David Fisher
in October last year. Since then, said Mr Jones, the new management has
transformed the group, which includes a chain of 10 games arcades in London.
He expects the circular proposing the latest deal to be sent to shareholders
in three to four weeks, with an extraordinary meeting soon after. The money
is likely to be raised in a placing and open offer.
After the purchase the group's market capitalisation is expected to be at
least Pounds 25m. The vendors of the games businesses will be keeping a
substantial amount of the equity.
Last August, BCE reported a deficit of Pounds 796,000 before and after tax
for the year to March 31. The outcome, on turnover of Pounds 3.73m, took in
exceptional charges totalling Pounds 203,000.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: F&amp;C share issue to raise Pounds 115m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets Investment Trust is set to raise up to
Pounds 115m of new capital with a C share issue.
Institutional investors have already spoken for 85m C shares at 100p during
the placing stage, and a further 30m shares are available in a public offer
opening on October 24. Demand has already exceeded F&amp;C's expectations; the
group had expected to cap the issue at Pounds 70m.
The trust currently has assets of about Pounds 150m. The additional capital
will make it the second largest general emerging markets trust, after
Templeton Emerging Markets, which has assets of Pounds 509m.
According to figures from Smith New Court, the F&amp;C trust was last week
trading at a package premium - taking both shares and warrants into account
 -to net asset value of 8.9 per cent, meaning that even after costs, the new
issue should be a cheaper way to buy into the fund than acquiring shares in
the market.
The trust's current asset allocation gives the heaviest weighting to Latin
America (43 per cent) and Asia (37 per cent), with smaller amounts in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Figures from the Association of
Investment Trust Companies place its share price performance second in its
sector over three years to end September.
Dealing in the C shares is due to start on November 18, and their conversion
into new ordinary shares and warrants will take place by March 31 1995.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Value of coal assets questioned - Demand
from generators will slump in late 1990s, report predicts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The successful bidders for British Coal mines have offered far more than is
being paid for coal assets on the international market, according to an
analysis published yesterday.
The report in Coal UK, the Financial Times newsletter, predicts a slump in
demand for coal from the electricity generators in the late 1990s. It will
fuel questions over whether the bidders have paid too much and can sustain
long-term profits.
The report casts doubts over the ability of RJB Mining, chosen as preferred
bidder for all three English regions, to make significant profits after
1998, when existing contracts with the generators end.
After 1998, 'it is difficult to believe that its margins will be sufficient
to cover ongoing costs, the costs of closures and any leftovers from the
bid'.
Coal UK says that whether the bids are measured in pounds per tonne of
reserves or pounds per tonne of saleable coal, the winning bidders for
England and Wales are paying much more than has recently been paid for coal
assets in other countries.
'Overseas investors would almost certainly look on British Coal as high cost
and producing poor quality coal.'
RJB's Pounds 900m bid equates to Pounds 1.54 per tonne of reserves and
Pounds 28 per tonne for saleable coal.
The report says that only one international sale has been higher recently
and that involved low sulphur mines.
'All other international deals were at less than Pounds 24 a tonne and the
vast bulk at below Pounds 20.'
The report forecasts that the English power market for coal is likely to be
squeezed further following government decisions to allow new gas-fired power
stations.
The English market could be below 25m tonnes by 2000, according to the
analysis.
National Power and PowerGen, the two fossil-fuel generators, currently buy
30m tonnes a year. RJB has said it sees limited decline after 1998.
Mining (Scotland), the consortium in which Waverley Mining Finance and Coal
Investments have stakes, is believed to have offered Pounds 60m to become
the preferred bidder for British Coal's Scottish mining assets.
This equates to Pounds 1.58 per tonne for the reserves and Pounds 12 a tonne
for saleable coal.
'The latter figure is the only one that fits into the international
perspective. The reserve valuation is way above comparable international
deals which range from 20p to 40p per tonne.'
Celtic Energy's estimated Pounds 95m tender for South Wales, which also has
preferred bidder status, equates to Pounds 1.79 per tonne of reserves and
Pounds 47.50 per tonne of saleable coal.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lucas pips Valeo to US components company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace component manufacturer, has
moved to strengthen its US business by agreeing to buy for Dollars 87m
(Pounds 54m) cash Lake Center Industries from Guy F Atkinson of San Bruno,
California.
This is Dollars 7m more than the sum which Valeo, the French components
manufacturer, said it would pay for the company. Valeo announced last Monday
that it had reached agreement to buy LCI.
Atkinson and Lucas had been 'talking over the last few weeks', Lucas said.
The discussions continued despite the Valeo announcement, indicating that
Atkinson had been playing one potential buyer off against the other.
Valeo said that it 'had not accepted a new request on the part of Atkinson
to increase the acquisition price and to modify certain essential conditions
initially agreed.' It would not therefore go ahead with the purchase.
Both Valeo and Lucas have been anxious to build up their presence in the US.
Lucas, seeking to strengthen its core automotive and aerospace activities,
will fit LCI into its automotive Body Systems business, which specialises in
electronic systems used inside vehicles. Body Systems is one of the nine
business areas Lucas has designated as central to its future.
LCI's speciality is the manufacture of control systems for heating and
ventilation of vehicles, products which Lucas has not made.
The purchase will enhance its ability to offer complete in-vehicle
electronic syst-ems.
This year LCI expects sales of Dollars 110m, rising to Dollars 140m next
year. In 1993 it had pre-tax profits of Dollars 5.7m and net assets of
Dollars 23.2m. LCI works on eight sites and employs 1,370 people.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: GEC asked to clarify bid intentions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Takeover Panel indicated yesterday that it had approached GEC to clarify
whether the industrial group was considering a bid for British Aerospace or
VSEL, the submarine manufacturer which has agreed a takeover offer from BAe.
The move follows a report earlier this week that GEC was considering a
hostile bid for VSEL, but had virtually ruled out an offer for BAe, the
aircraft and defence equipment company.
While the panel admitted it was following up the report, it is unlikely to
force GEC to clarify its intentions.
The group, headed by Lord Weinstock, emerged as a possible predator for VSEL
soon after it received BAe's Pounds 478.5m agreed bid last week.
On Tuesday, BAe tried to head off a counter-bid by telling GEC it would be
prepared to resume talks on merging the two companies' defence interests if
it abandoned its interest in the Barrow-based shipbuilder. GEC was said to
be unimpressed by the offer.
Both groups are interested in VSEL because it would extend their interests
in shipbuilding, and would bring the Pounds 2.5bn contract for the next
generation of five Trafalgar class nuclear submarines.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Aviation setback leaves Hunting down at
Pounds 13.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tough trading conditions in the aviation business dented first half pre-tax
profits at Hunting, which yesterday reported a 24 per cent decline from
Pounds 17.7m to Pounds 13.5m - although last year's figure was flattered by
a Pounds 5.8m contribution from the sale of a subsidiary.
At the operating level, profits from continuing operations were down 10 per
cent from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 16.5m.
Operating profits in the aviation division fell from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds
1.5m on turnover up 9 per cent at Pounds 81.1m (Pounds 74.7m). A lack of
orders from both the civil and military aviation sides hit the group's
overhauling and fitting business. Likewise, slack demand for the Saab 340
and BAe Jetstream 41 aircraft affected the company's interiors business.
On the defence side, operating profits rose 42 per cent to Pounds 7.4m
(Pounds 5.2m) on turnover 77 per cent ahead at Pounds 223.8m (Pounds
126.7m). The figures were boosted by the first full interim contribution
from the management contract to run the Atom-ic Weapons Establishment at
Aldermaston. This included an operating profit of Pounds 2.8m.
Profits from the oil services business were hit by weak oil prices in the
first quarter, declining 19 per cent to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 9.4m). Turnover
fell 17 per cent to Pounds 254.2m (Pounds 305.3m).
Group turnover advanced 10 per cent to Pounds 559.1m (Pounds 509.8m).
Earnings per share fell from 8.3p to 4.6p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 4p.
Despite the downturn, Mr Ken Miller, chief executive, was optimistic on the
outlook for the group. 'There have been special circumstances this year
which have affected our performance. But the benefits from our cost saving
programme will come through next year, the outlook for the aviation business
is more favourable, the defence business order book is good and there's more
activity in the oil business.'
The market took a dimmer view and the shares slipped 3p to 159p, their
lowest point since December 1993. Analysts cut their profit forecasts for
the year by about 15 per cent, with most settling in a range from Pounds 28m
to Pounds 31m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Telemetrix, the supplier of specialised electronic components, said that
GTI, its 58 per cent-owned US offshoot, is buying 70 per cent of Promptus
Communications for about Dollars 19m (Pounds 12m) cash.
Promptus supplies high-speed digital network access solutions for
videoconferencing, large-scale data transfer, image transfer, transmission
of integrated voice/data/video information and other multimedia
applications.
GTI will fund the purchase partly from its own cash resources and term debt
and partly from a placing of up to 650,000 shares. Telemetrix is expected to
buy up to 375,000 shares.
Promptus' management will continue to operate the company and will retain
the remaining 30 per cent interest. The acquisition is expected to close
within 60 days and in the interim GTI will make a pre-closing cash infusion
of Dollars 500,000 to fund product development.
At the same time, GTI reported a 44 per cent fall in net income from Dollars
3.56m to Dollars 1.99m for the third quarter to September 30. Sales were 13
per cent ahead at Dollars 37.1m (Dollars 32.8m). Earnings per share were 20
cents (35 cents).

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Rebel Barrs to oppose plans to enfranchise
non-voting shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Nicholas and Mr Robert Barr, the brothers who are attempting to unseat
their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr, as chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust,
yesterday pledged to vote down the board's plans to enfranchise non-voting
shares.
The brothers, who speak for 30 per cent of the voting shares, sent a letter
to Hambros, the leisure and motor distribution group's financial advisers,
stating their opposition to the board's resolution. The board needs a 75 per
cent majority to succeed.
They also repeated their demands for the removal of Mr Malcolm Barr along
with his chief executive, Mr John Parker, and his finance director, Mr Brian
Small. A second meeting will vote on Mr Parker and Mr Small before December.
'This did not start out as a family feud,' said Mr Nicholas Barr. 'We tried
to the best of our ability to persuade Malcolm Barr to take a graceful and
dignified exit from his position on the board. He chose to have no interest
in any of those proposals.'
The board yesterday declared its intention to continue with its EGM, and is
expected to issue a document next week, which is thought to include an
audited profit forecast, as well as details of the 1-for-1 scrip issue to
compensate ordinary shareholders for the loss of voting control.
Ironically, enfranchisement is one of the rebels' principal proposals for
modernising the company. The group's 10m non-voting shares are mainly owned
by institutions.
Nicholas and Robert are the sons of Mr Stuart Barr, the managing director
who died two years ago.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach Pounds 8.36m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stagecoach Holdings, the bus and coach operator, is acquiring Cleveland
Transit and the rest of Kingston Upon Hull Transport, which provides bus
services in Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees and Hull, in a Pounds 8.36m
deal.
Undertakings to accept the agreed offer have been received in respect of 51
per cent of the shares in Cleveland, which holds 51 per cent of Kingston
Transport.
The 359-for-200 offer values Cleveland at Pounds 7.7m and could involve the
issue of 3.59m shares. There are 385p-a-share cash and loan note
alternatives.
The 305,970 share offer for the outstanding stake in Kingston Transport is
worth Pounds 656,000.
In the year to March 26 Cleveland reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 950,000
on turnover of Pounds 11.4m. Net assets at the period-end were Pounds
117,000 after writing off goodwill of about Pounds 1.2m.
The results included Kingston from December 10 in which time it had pre-tax
profits of Pounds 50,000 on turnover of Pounds 2.4m.
Stagecoach said that Cleveland already had operating margins of 10 per cent.
Nonetheless, improved profits could be achieved with further investment in
new vehicles and economies of scale from the enlarged group.

FT  22 OCT 94 / UK Company News: NatWest signs Mondex cash card deal with
Hongkong Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank has made the first step in its attempt to
establish global usage for its Mondex electronic cash card by selling the
rights to franchise the card in several Asian countries to Hongkong &amp;
Shanghai Banking Corporation.
NatWest is also in talks with banks in Germany, France and the US to sell
the rights to franchise and develop the use of the card in those countries.
In return it is offering them equity stakes in a new company that will
control Mondex, in which NatWest will have a golden share.
NatWest is planning to test the card - which can be loaded by consumers with
electronic cash units and used in shops to pay for goods and services - in
Swindon next year. The British rights are held by NatWest in partnership
with Midland Bank and British Telecom.
Hongkong Bank, which is a subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, has acquired the
rights to franchise the card in Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Macau,
the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand. Hongkong Bank
Malaysia will have rights in Malaysia.
Mr Bert Morris, deputy chief executive of NatWest, said that the bank was in
talks with about 30 banks in 115 countries.
Mr Morris said he believed NatWest would be able to charge UK consumers for
the use of the card. 'We have not taken any decision, as my inclination
would be not to give it away. The banking industry has given far too many
things away.'
He said the agreement gave Hongkong Bank exclusive rights until 2005, but
that NatWest was talking to other banks in south-east Asia.
NatWest wants to establish Mondex as the worldwide standard for cash cards.
It uses a microchip to store cash units, and can be loaded at home with an
adapted telephone.

FT  22 OCT 94 / A nation desperate for relief: Iraqis' collective morale may
never have sunk so low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nothing demonstrates Iraq's isolation and deepening impoverishment more
starkly than the 1,000km desert highway that links Baghdad to Amman in
Jordan.
Traffic along the three-lane motorway, which has been Iraq's main link with
the world since flights were banned by the UN, has thinned to a dribble of
cars and an occasional truck. The country has run out of the means to afford
the imports of food and medicines that the UN permits. And the traffic that
does brave the highway is prey to highwaymen.
After 12 hours travelling Iraq's exposed, empty lifeline, vehicles reach the
anti-aircraft batteries of Baghdad's approaches. The highway then opens on
to the busy boulevards of a capital strewn with mighty monuments and
buildings: all in tribute to President Saddam Hussein and his ambition to
make Iraq an Arab superpower.
In spite of four years of sanctions, Baghdad has kept up appearances. With
dogged ingenuity, the Iraqis have rebuilt almost everything the
70,000-80,000 tonnes of allied bombs destroyed during the Gulf war in 1991.
They have chipped away broken concrete to recover reinforcing rods. They
have cannibalised spare parts. And they have rebuilt Iraq's main
telecommunications, power, water, sewage and road networks. Mr Saddam has
even had a new communications tower built, claimed to be the Middle East's
tallest structure, and is planning what officials call 'the biggest mosque
in the world'. The Saddam mosque, naturally.
Iraqis are proud of this rebirth, whatever they think about their leader -
something few Iraqis risk venturing to strangers. 'We hear all about
rebuilding Lebanon, rebuilding Kuwait - no one ever wrote about how we
rebuilt Iraq, without any foreign money or the original plans of the foreign
manufacturers,' said one Iraqi electrician. 'Do you know we rebuilt our
earth station? More than 100,000 fragments, all put back together.'
But towers, mosques and earth stations cannot hide the clear plunge in
Iraqis' living conditions in the past few months. As the same Iraqi put it:
'Sanctions are hurting now. The first, second, third years - then maybe we
were bluffing. It was for the foreign media, our suffering. But now it
hurts.'
There are plenty of signs that Iraq has reached a critical stage. Food
supplies are perilously short. Iraq imported 70 per cent of its food, at an
annual cost of Dollars 1.1bn, before the war. The government says it is now
spending an annual Dollars 700m on food, and cannot do that for much longer.
Last month it halved the basic rations of sugar, oil, rice and flour that
every Iraqi has been entitled to since 1990. This year's harvest is down by
a third on last year's poor crop. Farmers have not been able to get
pesticides or fertilisers and, after four years' cropping without fallow,
have leached their soil, say UN officials.
Rations only met 70 per cent of basic nutritional needs, before the cuts.
Hence the rise in the number of children with stomachs bloated by
malnutrition appearing in Baghdad's hospital beds. Doctors at the Saddam
Children's Hospital say that so far this year they have admitted 500
children with marasmus, a severe form of malnutrition, compared with about
65 a year before the embargo. They are also critically short of drugs.
Food prices have soared. Two dozen eggs or a kilo of lamb costs ID1,000,
about half an average government employee's monthly pay. One school teacher,
buying an ID500 tin of babymilk powder in the Shorjah souk, said this
represented a third of her monthly income. 'It's all the money I have, so I
must spend it for my children,' she said. 'Of course we can't manage.'
It is Iraq's salaried classes which are worst hit. Of Baghdad's 1m
middle-class Christians, more than 300,000 are thought to have fled since
1991. The government is trying to staunch the flow. Dina, a 23-year-old
secretary, says she qualified as a petrochemical engineer at Baghdad
university, but has not been granted her degree papers. 'Without it they
know I can't get a job overseas,' she says, adding that one college mate, a
mechanical engineer, has resorted to selling cigarettes by the roadside for
a living. Baghdad's souks are full of people selling the family silver -
literally.
The Iraqi dinar has become funny money - locals refer to it simply as
'paper'. Hard economic data are rare, but the government estimates that
prices have risen by 5,000 per cent since 1990. Exchange a Dollars 100 bill
in Baghdad and you receive a 15cm bundle of dinars. Banks ferry money inside
branches in supermarket trolleys and receive truck deliveries of notes each
morning. The few who are making money out of sanctions, such as spare parts
dealers, smugglers and the Baghdad-Amman taxi drivers in their hulking GMC
Suburbans, buy their cars and houses with 50kg sack-loads of dinars.
A grim pall has settled over Baghdad. The city's restaurants are dark and
empty. Public drinking has been banned. A rise in crime and low-level graft,
once almost absent, and army desertions has seen the government resort to
the severing of hands, feet or ears by way of punishment.
But while Iraqis' collective morale may never have sunk so low, there are
few signs that this is coalescing into any articulated, let alone organised,
opposition to Mr Saddam. Iraqis are keeping their private feelings private.
'Even if Saddam has lost support - and there's no doubt many hate Saddam -
people cannot react because they fear the regime,' says a diplomat. Another
suggests that with 'one in 20 working for the mukhabarat (secret police), at
a conservative guess', it is hard to assess what political forces are
stirring.
Another year without reprieve from the embargo would certainly aggravate the
ruin of Iraq's middle class and cause more crime and starvation, but it
still might not shift the Iraqi leader.
The hardship of sanctions may even be strengthening Mr Saddam's hand, some
argue. 'Put it this way,' says an ambassador in Baghdad, 'at present, who is
closer to the Iraqi people's concerns? The UN, the US and the exiled Iraqi
opposition who want to keep sanctions on, or Saddam, who is fighting to get
them lifted? Even those who hate Saddam are now in the same basket.'
No one wholly rules out a palace coup from within Mr Saddam's al-Takrit clan
elite, or a rising of disgruntled officers. But neither seems likely. And if
either occurred, it would come out of the blue even for the most plugged-in
observers.
The view from Baghdad is that Mr Saddam is staying, whatever the US, the UK
and the Iraqi opposition may hope.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Single mother 'refugees' welcome in
Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms EILEEN ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, With reference to the article, 'How to recognise the British ex-pat -
executives who choose to live overseas' (Management, October 14), I note
that the category of 'political refugee' was overlooked. This includes that
dreaded breed known as single mothers obliged to live outside their country.
That much maligned little city of Brussels accepts such ex-pats, allowing
single parents to work and care for their offspring with the aid of
state-run creches and nursery schools of very good quality, open at
convenient hours (07.30 to 18.30) and contributed to in accordance with
their salary.
In turn, such refugees are fully contributing members of society and very
happy to be part of a community which actually likes women and children,
unlike life under a certain British government whose record on childcare
leaves much to be desired.

life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WARREN EDWARDES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To my chagrin, my Spanish wife can enter and leave the UK with no more
than a credit card-sized ID card. Furthermore, in many countries ID cards
are essential for day-to-day business purposes, such as entering clients'
offices. Passports have to be carried in lieu of ID cards.
To avoid the hassle of carrying a passport while abroad I have made myself
an ID card. While consulting in South Africa last year, I stuck a photograph
on my UK driving licence and my client over-stamped it and signed it.
I have had no problems with my 'official' papers within and without the EU,
though I have not yet tried it at a frontier.
May I suggest a cheap and speedy low-tech ID card - the back cover of the
EU/UK passport. The blank reverse could contain the holder's signature,
driving licence and National Insurance details.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Endangered species: New corporate investors threaten the
traditional Lloyd's Name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Having lost 'an astonishingly large sum of money' at Lloyd's of London, Mr
Glenie Joel, a 65 year-old retired soldier, is reluctant to offer financial
advice. But he does have one tip: 'I certainly wouldn't suggest that anyone
went into Lloyd's'
In the past, becoming a Name at Lloyds, as Mr Joel did in 1988, appeared an
attractive investment with considerable tax advantages. Today, with the
insurance market having incurred enormous losses, the number of Names is
shrinking rapidly. With the arrival at Lloyd's of increasing numbers of
corporate investors, the future of the traditional Name looks still less
certain.
The introduction into Lloyd's of capital from companies rather than
individuals should take a step forward in the next few weeks when Wellington
Underwriting announces that it has capital in place for a UK stock-market
listing. By planning company to invest in a narrow range of Lloyd's
insurance syndicates, it will be the closest a listed company has come to
mimicking the role of individual Names in providing capital to underwrite
insurance policies.
There is one crucial distinction, however. Whereas Names joined underwriting
syndicates on the basis of unlimited liability - and were vulnerable down to
their last collar stud, the maximum losses of corporate investors are
capped.
The emergence of the new listed Lloyd's companies raises the question of why
prudent investors should want to invest again in Lloyd's on an unlimited
basis. 'Unlimited liability is going to go,' says Mr John Mays of the
Merrett Names Association, a group representing other Names who have lost
money.
Unlimited liability offers high gearing - Names can underwrite policies
paying premiums up to five times the value of their investment. In good
years, this gearing level can mean high profits. However, the downside is
illustrated by the fate of thousands of Feltrim and Gooda Walker Names, who
have lost a total of more than Pounds 1bn and are chasing compensation
through the courts.
Even without Lloyd's recent troubles, the traditional Name looked
anachronistic. Some in the industry believe that unlimited liability is
legal nonsense because nobody has unlimited assets.
At the same time, the organisational structure of Lloyd's - developed in the
17th century to provide simple marine insurance policies - is unlikely to be
appropriate in an increasingly competitive market.
The tax advantages of becoming a UK Name have also diminished as income tax
rates have fallen. Names could offset losses against marginal tax rates as
high as 98 per cent in the late 1970s, and 60 per cent in the mid-1980s when
Lloyd's membership was growing rapidly. With a top tax rate today of 40 per
cent, the attraction has fallen.
Tax benefits remain: for example Names can keep profits in 'special reserve'
funds, without paying tax, to use for paying future losses. But that has not
stopped Names leaving Lloyd's. In 1989 more than 31,000 Names were actively
underwriting. Next year the total may drop below 16,000.
Lloyd's management is not yet ready to declare the traditional Name defunct.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, believes the injection of corporate capital is
critical to Lloyd's future. But he is keen to respect Names' interests.
'I want a level playing field between old and new capital so that market
forces can dictate,' says Mr Rowland. There are two good reasons for being
fair to traditional investors at this stage.
First, the company investors are unproven. This year, the first in which
corporate capital has been allowed, 25 companies have invested about Pounds
900m in the market. Most have spread their funds across a broad range of
syndicates, sometimes as many as 100. Typically they are allowed to
underwrite premiums worth twice their investment, a level of gearing that
may not produce sufficient returns to entice investors. Under Lloyd's
acc-ounting rules, this year's underwriting profits will not begin to flow
until 1996.
Second, Na-mes will continue to provide most of Lloyd's fin-ances for some
years. Moreover, the high gearing is still attractive for some wealthy
individuals. To lessen the risks of unlimited liability, Lloyd's introduced
last year a 'high level stop-loss' scheme offering protection against
excessive losses.
Existing Names have an incentive to carry on trading - if they can afford
to. Though 1992 is expected to have been loss-making, 1993 is regarded as
having been profitable. Meanwhile relief is in sight from the problem of
outstanding US pollution and asbestosis claims dating from as far back as
the 1940s. Liabilities on policies underwritten by Names in 1985 or before
are expected by the end of next year to have been taken over by Newco, a
company set up by Lloyd's to 'ring fence' the so-called 'old years' problem.
This should mean many Names can finally rid themselves of the still
unquantified past losses.
The picture could, however, change considerably by 1996 or 1997 when
insurance may have entered a cyclical downturn. 'Before 2000 most of us who
are still underwriting will be doing so with limited liability,' says Mr
Robert Saunders, director at accountancy and banking company Smith &amp;
Williamson.
By then the wider repercussions of introducing corporate capital will also
have been felt. Corporate investors may want big changes to the Lloyd's
underwriting system, and it could become hard for Lloyd's to balance the
interests of companies and individuals on unlimited liability. The unlimited
liability Name may become an endangered species.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GARY TITLEY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ian Davidson reproduces the misconception which is a flaw in the UK's
attitude towards the EU - that European policy is a part of foreign policy
and so is remote from everyday existence ('Blair's EU labours', October 12).
The EU is about domestic policy and should be interwoven in all our debates.
Only then will the British get to grips with 'Europe'. It was presumably in
recognition of this that Tony Blair gave his deputy, John Prescott, a
European remit.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Road pricing would benefit UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW TYLECOTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor ('Dying romance of the open road', October 19) is too
gloomy about the obstacles to a sea-change in transport policy.
Electronic road pricing will not damage the economy at all - on the
contrary. The revenue raised will allow existing taxes to be lowered by the
same amount; in fact, they could be lowered more, if one chose, given the
National Health Service savings from less pollution and accidents. And
business (like individuals) will benefit greatly from the reduction in
congestion - high-technology industry is more concerned with speed and
reliability than with direct cost of transport.
Country-dwellers will not be disadvantaged if, as is sensible, road pricing
(and tight pollution control) is introduced first in urban areas - where the
charges would always be higher.
Traffic-blighted communities can have their bypasses without serious damage
to the countryside as long as they are narrow and discreet. At present that
would be pointless, because drivers would scorn such an alternative; but if
the charge for going through were high enough, they would go round.
Road pricing is a win-win option; what is the government waiting for?

FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Globalisation still a route to
sustainable success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK H J RADCLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bronwen Maddox, in her article 'Masters of a fragmented universe'
(October 17), says globalisation is now only being heard of from a handful
of industries. That this is so is less to do with flawed acquisition
strategies than to do with a failure to conceive and implement effectively.
There are dozens of industries where sustainable success, and financial
return, will only be ultimately achieved by those who can get their global
act together.
The reasons for some industries being susceptible to globalisation and
others not range from the need to recover high R&amp;D or tooling costs (eg,
pharmaceutical and automotive), the utilisation of special knowledge or
servicing skills (eg, international plant construction and maintenance, or
advisers such as auditors), or brand recognition and quality assurance (eg,
McDonald's).
We need to encourage and not discourage those businessmen with the vision,
courage and capability to do it, rather than taking a narrow, comfortable
and parochial route.

FT  22 OCT 94 / The armchair shopper: A look at the commercial appeal of
'virtual shopping malls'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A giant shopping centre will soon be built right on your doorstep. There
will be hundreds of stores, banks, a supermarket, car dealerships,
billboards - all within sight of your living-room armchair.
But don't rush to organise a protest. There will be no concrete poured in
the construction of this mega-mall. It is a 'virtual' shopping centre, just
a few seconds down the information superhighway.
Electronic shopping centres are proliferating as retailers spot the chance
to create a direct, low-cost marketing channel to a fast-growing and
predominantly affluent group of consumers - home-computer users.
More than a third of all US households now have a personal computer and 12
per cent - approximately 11m people - are equipped with a modem that allows
them access via the telephone to the electronic data networks. Among US
households with an annual income exceeding Dollars 50,000, the percentage of
'net travellers' - users of such networks - rises to 27 per cent.
This level of access has prompted a charge into electronic shopping, led by
commercial networks such as Compuserve, America Online and Prodigy. They now
have more than 5m subscribers who use their on-line discussion groups, live
chat 'rooms' and news services, as well as electronic shopping.
Each has an 'electronic mall', with more than 100 stores selling products
from a Brooks Brothers suit to honey-baked ham.
The Internet - a global web of computer networks with an estimated 25m-30m
users - is also going commercial. Last month, Home Shopping Network, which
operates the Home Shopping cable TV channel, acquired Internet Shopping
Network (ISN), a fledgling Silicon Valley company that began selling
computer products on the Internet five months ago.
'It is a bold step towards opening up a huge new market,' says Mr Randy
Adams, founder of ISN. Home Shopping is planning 'a major push into the
digital environment, a first step towards interactive television', he says.
With distribution and billing facilities already in place, Home Shopping
Network is poised to create the first large-scale electronic shopping
service on the Internet. Already there are dozens of smaller retailers on
the Internet. Merchants from Palo Alto, in California's Silicon Valley, for
example, have posted listings of their wares while the city's restaurants
provide menus on-line.
For consumers, the main appeal of on-line shopping is convenience.
Electronic stores are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The services
draw 'too busy, two-income families', say the electronic merchants.
Most of the computer shopping services available today take the form of
product lists with detailed descriptions of the merchandise and discount
prices. For people who know what they want - a particular brand of clothing
or a specific model of a household appliance - on-line shopping is a quick
way to find a bargain. Without even a picture of the product, however, it is
hard to imagine buying an outfit for a special occasion or a piece of
furniture from an on-line service.
But multimedia computers are beginning to make electronic shopping much more
interesting. Industry analysts predict that on-line sales of goods and
services will mushroom into a multi-billion dollar industry over the next
three years as the technology becomes more widely available.
A high-performance multimedia PC (now selling in the US for about Dollars
2,500) with a fast modem can handle graphics, audio and video clips, giving
shoppers a much richer view of the products available. Multimedia also
expands the range of goods and services that can be marketed effectively
on-line.
For instance, the Global Network Navigator, a free Internet service provided
by O'Reilly &amp; Associates, a California publishing group, has established a
'travel resource centre'. Users can watch a video clip promoting the
delights of a holiday resort, read travel articles, join a discussion group
where people share travel experiences or check weather forecasts.
Even with a fast modem, however, on-line access to multimedia services
through the telephone network can be tediously slow. A compromise approach
that is gaining popularity involves publishing a multimedia catalogue on a
CD-Rom disc which carries the images and sound. Updates on prices and
availability, as well as ordering, are available on-line.
'The problem with the on-line world today is that the technology is long in
the tooth,' says Mr Stephen Tomlin, vice-president in charge of interactive
technology development at QVC, Home Shopping Network's rival in the cable TV
shopping market.
'To be a good merchant you have to have a rich interaction with the customer
 -show the merchandise, demonstrate its features and have a real dialogue.
We are limited by current modem speeds,' says Mr Tomlin.
Yet electronic shopping may be on the brink of a technology breakthrough
that could give 'virtual' shopping malls a competitive edge on the real
thing. The latest computer network technology for electronic commerce
provides 'intelligent assistants' - computer programs that travel the data
networks in search of information, or products, at the behest of their
owners.
AT&amp;T, the telecoms group, recently launched PersonaLink network service, the
first commercial application of this technology. Using software developed by
eShop, a California software venture, Per-sonaLink will create a 'market
square' with electronic shopping assistants to help subscribers browse,
select and make purchases.
These 'cyberpersonas' will get to know your interests and tastes, what
sports you enjoy, your shoe size, your spending habits and more. Retailers
will provide these 'electronic assistants' to help you to make your
purchases.
You might also want to create your own electronic assistant, who will look
through several electronic stores to find what you need at the best
available price.
These assistants will emulate the role of the high-street tailor who knew
your measurements, the corner grocer who used to deliver a regular weekly
order to your home, or the saleswoman who helped you to select Christmas
gifts.
Many retailers see these developments as an opportunity to experiment in the
brave new world of 'virtual' shopping before it becomes a 21st century mass
consumer service on 'interactive television'.
'It makes sense to get into the game, to understand what is going on,' says
Mr Tomlin.
So when are they going to start building that virtual shopping centre?
'It's not around the corner, but there is no doubt that it is going to
happen,' says Mr Adams. 'We are young enough to wait.'

FT  22 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unsubstantiated failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY WITCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Hammer, ('No need for excuses', October 5) writing of
re-engineering failure rates, says '. . . we find it breathtaking when the
70 per cent figure is cited as an authoritative statement of
re-engineering's successes and failures because . . . one of us made it up'.
Something similar happened for total quality management (TQM); there, the
authoritative failure figure is 80 per cent. It was cited widely at the
recent annual conference of the British Academy of Management, yet research
conducted at Durham and University of Manchester Institute of Science and
Technology clearly showed that the vast majority of TQM is still in place,
and that less than 5 per cent of organisations seem totally dissatisfied.
For example, in a large survey of organisations in Scotland last year, fewer
than 1 per cent of organisations with TQM expressed total dissatisfaction.
Perhaps for new things it is always 'open season'.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Serious game of mud-slinging: Election campaigns for
governor and senator in California are proving bitter and expensive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One statewide candidate, pockets deep with oil money and driven by a
ruthless wife, wants a government that 'does nothing'. Another reveals on
television that her daughter has been raped and her son mugged. Both major
incumbents have the charisma of meat loaf. All throw mud at each other like
confetti. The state itself, a magnet for immigrants for 150 years, seems on
the verge of denying social services to those illegally inside its borders.
This is 1994, the supposed year of the Great Political Discontent, and the
state, naturally, is California which, in the realms of the bizarre, has
always taken some beating. And it may buck national trends again on November
8 by returning to the governor's mansion in Sacramento and to the US Senate
in Washington a pair of extremely professional incumbent politicians, a
species widely believed to be in extreme danger.
They are the dogged duo of Pete Wilson, Republican governor, and Dianne
Feinstein, Democratic senator. Both have opponents notionally more in tune
with the times.
Kathleen Brown, the Democratic state treasurer up against Mr Wilson, is not
merely the third member of California's great dynastic political family to
seek the governorship but appears the very model of the articulate,
telegenic modern woman candidate. Congressman Michael Huffington, the
Republican trying to unseat Ms Feinstein, is cast in the mould of Ross
Perot, a political neophyte willing to spend a large chunk of a personal
fortune in the pursuit of elective office.
With less than three weeks to go, the bitter and expensive campaigns - with
Dollars 27m spent on the Senate race alone by the end of last month - seem
to have settled into a pattern. Mr Wilson, 20 points down this spring, has
pulled into a 10-13 point lead over Ms Brown by hitting the 'hot button'
issues of crime and illegal immigration.
Ms Feinstein, 20 points ahead as late as this summer, seems to have
weathered the storm of Mr Huffington's unprecedented negative advertising
that had brought him to parity last month and now holds a 7-9 point margin.
But this has been mostly because of the torrent of critical media attention
that has descended on the heads of Mr Huffington and his wife.
It is often dangerously easy to poke fun at Californian politics. After all,
in the last 30 years, the state has elected a retired B-movie actor (Ronald
Reagan), an ageing song-and-dance man (George Murphy), a very odd fish
(Jerry Brown) and a distinguished but eccentric professor of linguistics (S
I Hayakawa).
Its ballot papers are always littered with populist referendums, to the
point, it sometimes seems, of democracy run riot. Sam Popkin, of the
University of California at San Diego, notes that in the past four years the
voters of San Diego County have been asked to pass judgment on no less than
690 candidates and propositions. ('What do you have in England?' he asks
rhetorically. 'Three - the Commons, the European parliament and local
councils.')
Yet some have been harbingers for the nation, such as the tax-cutting
initiative that passed in 1978, or the environmental one ('big green') which
failed in 1990.
This year's eye-catcher would deny education and non-emergency healthcare to
illegal immigrants - and it will probably pass, if only to be challenged
immediately in court. Another would repeal all local anti-smoking ordinances
in favour of a more lenient statewide standard, while a third seeks approval
for a state-funded (or 'single payer') healthcare system.
Reading California right is a prerequisite for any politician with national
ambition, especially now that the 1996 state presidential primary, which
traditionally wound up the election season, has been brought forward to
early March.
This century only three Democrats have become president without carrying
California - Wilson in 1912, Kennedy in 1960 and Carter in 1976. No
Republican ever has, which is why George Bush's abandonment of the state in
the final months of the 1992 campaign is still subject to endless second
guessing. Two of the last five elected presidents - Nixon and Reagan - have
called California their home.
There are serious Republicans on the east coast who believe that, if Mr
Wilson wins, he becomes the automatic front-runner for the party's
presidential nomination in 1996. Californians, who know him well as mayor of
San Diego, senator and governor, suspect he is more interested in the
vice-presidency. Certainly his often tongue-tied and mean-spirited
performance in last week's televised debate with Ms Brown was devoid of the
charisma expected at the head of a national ticket. In the debate, he also
half-promised to serve a full four years if returned - not that such a
commitment has deterred other politicians from changing their minds.
But at the very least, as the man who could deliver California and its 52
electoral college votes, he would become a major player in a national
Republican party whose divided factions, in the opinion of Professor Popkin,
leave it with no apparent kingmaker. His policy record, if not his campaign,
is in the moderate mainstream and includes support for abortion and a
willingness to increase taxes under duress. Neither conforms to the
Reaganite conservative orthodoxy that again is trying to rule the Republican
roost.
National hopes on the Democratic side were also held out for Kathleen Brown,
glowingly portrayed as more down to earth than her ex-governor brother,
Jerry, and more articulate than her revered ex-governor father, Pat. But her
campaign had been without passion or definition - until a crisp performance
in the TV debate, during which she disclosed what had happened to her son
and daughter as a means of rebutting Mr Wilson's charge that she was
indifferent to the victims of crime.
Even Willie Brown, legendary Democratic speaker of the California House, had
begun to despair that she could persuade the state that she would govern
very differently from Mr Wilson. Their confrontations, mostly conducted
through a series of negative TV advertisements, tended to play to his
populist issues not hers. California's economic recovery rendered her
65-page reform plan less relevant beyond her turning conventional political
rhetoric on its head by charging that he was 'just another tax and spend
Republican'.
As for the extraordinary Senate race, a shorthand version would go something
like this. Michael Huffington moves from Texas and in 1992 becomes the
congressman for Santa Barbara by spending the most money ever (over Dollars
5m) in an election for the House. Ten months later, after a record
conspicuous for total invisibility, he announces that he will spend what it
takes to defeat Ms Feinstein. Willie Brown recalls that, on learning how
much (upwards of Dollars 20m), he phoned the senator and said 'Dianne,
you've got a problem'.
He is proved right as the Feinstein lead dwindles in the face of an
advertising onslaught with one central theme: 'Feinstein - a career
politician who'll say or do anything to stay in office.' Mr Huffington does
not appear to stand for anything beyond a vague conviction that the
volunteer spirit will enable the country to do away with welfare. He rarely
gives interviews or, until this week, appears much in public, but the polls
show that Californians are unconcerned if this is how a rich man wants to
spend his money - it is his, after all, and Ms Feinstein is not exactly
poor.
But, bit by bit, the local and national media unearth the Huffington
problem, which is partly his own history of under-achievement, spiced by
suggestions that he has evaded California income tax, but mostly concerns
his wife. She is the former Arianna Stassinopoulos, well known in social and
literary circles in her Cambridge and London days.
Not only is her husband seen as her puppet (the 'host body' for her own
ambitions, as the Los Angeles Times put it), but it also comes out she is,
or was, a devotee of a New Age guru by the name of John-Roger, who recovered
from a bout with kidney stones and pronounced himself more powerful than
Jesus Christ. She holds strange orchestrated salons in Washington, in which
guests find their thoughts recorded on tape. She fires campaign aides at
will, or they leave in protest at her control. She claims to do charity work
at charities which say they have hardly ever seen her.
All this and much more has been gleefully reported in the media and by
cartoonists like Garry Trudeau, creator of the Doonesbury strip. In Willie
Brown's opinion, Doonesbury's 'empty suit' - which is how Mr Huffington is
drawn - has instantly fixed all the real problems of a disorganised and
depressed Feinstein campaign.
Like Governor Wilson, she would rather not run on personality, which is a
bit dour and short-tempered, but on a record which is distinctly
respectable, both as mayor of San Francisco and in the Senate. Her finest
legislative hour came in the destructive final hours of Congress two weeks
ago, when she single-handedly rescued a bill protecting Californian deserts.
Still, she has been forced into negative advertising of her own and to
devote many hours to private fund-raising, rather than public campaigning.
But she is not home and free yet. Voter turn-out will be low, which favours
the more energised Republicans. The lack of enthusiasm for Kathleen Brown,
unless reversed in the final weeks, could drag down Democratic candidates
state-wide.
So may disaffection with President Bill Clinton, though polls find his
standing in California higher than in most states. However, the national
Republican leadership has not rallied to Mr Huffington, as it has to Oliver
North in Virginia, preferring to concentrate efforts in California
congressional races, where at least five Democratic incumbents are seriously
up against it.
One final element of perspective must be noted. For all the ubiquity of
election advertising, the political campaigns are still only the second
biggest story in California, behind the OJ Simpson trial and its
extraordinary out-of-court activities. Only if Judge Lance Ito were to lock
away both jury and media would the politicians have the stage to themselves.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Doyen of the lobbyists - Ian Greer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a relaxed and convivial scene. About 20 men and women linger over
after-dinner coffee and drinks in a private room in the most exclusive
restaurant in Christchurch, a sleepy and well-heeled town on England's south
coast. They include some of the UK's best-known political journalists. It is
the eve of the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth, a few miles
away.
An impeccably dressed and dark-browed man slips easily from conversation to
conversation with practised grace. Discreetly attentive to his guests'
requirements, he exchanges views on the main political issues of the day
with knowledgeable affability. Mr Ian Greer is in his element.
Mr Greer is the doyen of UK political lobbyists. A spry 61, he and his firm,
Ian Greer Associates, have been the driving force behind the rapid growth of
professional lobbying in Britain.
Yet earlier this week, reports in The Guardian newspaper linked IGA to a new
'cash for questions' controversy involving alleged payments to MPs for
tabling parliamentary questions.
Mr Greer has strenuously denied the allegation that the firm acted as a
conduit to channel money from Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods, to two
Tory MPs during the battle for control of London's premier department store
in the late 1980s. He has served a writ on The Guardian.
But the affair has prompted the resignation of one junior minister and
placed a question mark over the career of another.
It is all a long way from 1968, when Mr Greer - once a Conservative party
agent - helped set up Russell Greer, his first public relations venture. At
that time, he found little demand among industrialists for his insights into
Whitehall decision-making. The firm became primarily a financial PR
specialist. Mr Greer eventually sold his shareholding to other directors.
When he formed IGA in 1981, business was waking up to the benefits of the
services a specialist political lobbyist could provide. Since then, the
industry has grown rapidly, from next to nothing 20 years ago to a business
with an estimated annual turnover of Pounds 20m today. Its influence has
become pervasive: the work of lobbyists is discernible behind the scenes
almost whenever an important government decision is in the process of being
made.
From the government's legislative plans to politically sensitive takeover
bids and the contents of the Budget, lobbyists like Mr Greer will be
beavering away on behalf of clients, seeking early warning of forthcoming
events and trying to shape decisions to their best advantage.
IGA lobbied actively on Mr Fayed's behalf for a number of years in the late
1980s in return for an annual fee of around Pounds 50,000 - about the going
rate. It monitored Whitehall documents for him for a further period - a
service that would typically command a fee of Pounds 10,000-Pounds 12,000
per annum.
The signs are that IGA will have to work hard to retain its pre-eminent
position among professional lobbyists. His blue-chip client list includes
British Airways, Philip Morris, the government of Taiwan and Channel Four
Television. But one client has already indicated it is considering
dispensing with the firm's services, and predicted the furore could be 'very
damaging' for IGA's business.
The new allegations could not have come at a more sensitive time for the
lobbying business. The unfavourable publicity has increased scrutiny of its
activities and demands for tighter controls.
Lobbyists have reacted by taking steps to regulate themselves more
effectively, while renewing long-repeated calls for Parliament to draw up a
statutory code of practice. Five firms, including IGA, recently founded a
trade association and launched a code of conduct banning all financial links
with MPs. Mr Greer came out in favour of statutory regulation as long ago as
1985.
Even before the recent bad publicity, specialist firms such as IGA had been
under pressure. Since the recession in the early 1990s, clients have
increasingly tended to manage their public relations operations in-house and
to hire outside consultants for only short-term projects.
In addition, a new breed of practitioner is advising organisations on how to
do their own lobbying. One of the new breed, Mr Charles Clarke, once a top
aide to former Labour party leader Mr Neil Kinnock, argues: 'Too many lobby
companies claim that only they understand the machinery of Whitehall,
Westminster or Brussels power.' He accuses them of building up 'the mystique
of politics' to get commissions.
While Mr Greer acknowledges that lobbying once had such mystique, he
contends this has long disappeared. He says Mr Clarke is 'out of date, poor
man'.
Nevertheless, Mr Greer is likely to need all his tenacity and ingenuity to
maintain the steady growth of his company - which now has about 50
employees, including many former aides to top politicians, and an annual
turnover of Pounds 3.5m.
Until recently, Mr Greer had managed, for the most part, to avoid publicity,
popping up only sporadically in headlines. In 1990, he told MPs that he had
made six payments to three MPs over the previous five years for introducing
business. Later that year, he used his Daimler to chauffeur Mr John Major to
an engagement during his successful campaign for the Tory party leadership.
The closeness of his ties with the prime minister was underlined when Mr
Major, along with a number of other cabinet ministers, attended IGA's 10th
anniversary celebrations three years ago.
But these days, with the Tories trailing in the polls, it makes sound
business sense for IGA to be even-handed in its relations with the main
political parties. Earlier this year, the firm paid for the drinks at a
reception for some Labour European election candidates at London's Cafe
Royal.
As Mr Greer walks Humphrey, his poodle, in Richmond Park today, he could be
forgiven for feeling all of his 61 years. Thoughts of retirement are far
from his mind, however. 'Good God, no] What am I going to do?' he exclaims.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Step by step in Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Another day, another step towards lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Just
eight weeks ago it would have been prudent to avoid the expression of such
optimism, however guardedly. Now, as each 24 hours passes since the IRA
declared a ceasefire on August 31, it is possible to argue that the tortuous
process of constructing a settlement to which all assent may, against
expectations, eventually end in success.
The obstacles are well-known. Past IRA ceasefires have been short-lived. The
'loyalist' terrorists, who laid down their arms only a couple of weeks ago,
may not be able to maintain discipline. Critically, each side expects
ultimate victory. Sinn Fein is allowing its followers to suppose that
entering the peace process will lead to a united Ireland. The unionists vow
that Ulster will never leave the ambit of the United Kingdom.
Seemingly undaunted, the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland have pursued
the peace process they initiated when they signed a joint declaration in
Downing Street last December. That committed both governments to acceptance
of the will of the Ulster electorate, an undertaking reinforced by a
subsequent promise of a referendum on any new negotiated deal. It also
invited the terrorists on both sides to abandon violence and take their
chances with the democratic process.
In Dublin Mr Albert Reynolds has addressed himself primarily to a
nationalist audience; in London and, yesterday, Belfast, Mr John Major has
sought to allay unionist suspicions. Both have demonstrated skill and
courage. The Taoiseach is convening his forum for national peace and
reconciliation, which one unionist party may attend. Mr Major has moved at a
tactically deliberate pace. He intimated yesterday that the cease-fire
declared on August 31 will henceforth be regarded as genuine, although the
IRA refuses to declare it 'permanent'.
Verbal camouflage
The two prime ministers meet at Chequers on Monday. Talks with the IRA/Sinn
Fein should begin in a few weeks. There are many items on the agenda. Some
will be matters of intricate negotiation, designed to persuade the
perpetrators of violence to hand over their explosives as a prelude to
surrendering their guns. Some will involve verbal camouflage, such as a
refusal to grant an amnesty to convicted terrorists, combined with an
assurance that paroles will be easier when there is no threat of a
repetition of the original offence.
This delicate horse-trading could break down at any stage. Yet the climate
of local opinion is a form of insurance against a resurgence of violence.
Yesterday Mr Major called for all Ulster inhabitants to speak out for peace.
He lifted the ban on Sinn Fein leaders entering the British mainland, opened
cross-border roads, and indicated that the number of troops on the streets
would progressively be reduced. By so doing he recognised some nationalist
aspirations. The business community was offered a pre-Christmas conference
on investment in the six counties.
Changes afoot
The unionists have something of greater immediate value - an unbreakable
assurance that there will be no change in the constitution without their
consent. Yet changes are afoot. Sooner or later the political framework
being designed in Dublin, London and Belfast will have to be put on the
table for debate. Mr Major has promised publication, which is essential if
suspicions are to be kept to a minimum.
Ulster will be offered its own legislature, elected by proportional
representation to guarantee a share of power to parties representing the
Catholic minority. New institutions, answerable to both London and Dublin,
would operate in both parts of the island. These might cover matters such as
tourism and the environment.
The structural example often cited is that of Nato, whose member states
retain their national sovereignty while pooling military resources. To set
the seal on the package, the Dublin government would seek to amend the
articles in the Irish constitution that lay claim to Ulster, while Britain
would make an equivalent change in its own law.
When all the documents have been signed, the deal will be put before the
Irish electorates, north and south. Some British ministers expect the
negotiations to take two years. Barring accidents, there may be a denouement
before that.
The unionists are being asked to pay for peace by accepting that if they are
outnumbered they may be outvoted in a future referendum. Republicans, and
the IRA in particular, are expected to acquiesce in the postponement of that
day of reckoning for perhaps another 25 years, and possibly forever. They
are given encouragement by Dublin's words about how in due course the south
will seem a more inviting place to northern Protestants. For Sinn Fein,
after 25 years of violence during which they made no progress towards their
goal, it is the only option that makes sense.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Concern over pension mis-selling to widen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new area of concern about pension mis-selling will be opened up next week
when a report from the City's chief regulator highlights the position of
people who bought personal pensions and did not join their employers'
schemes.
Pension sales agents and advisers could face significant compensation claims
for selling personal pensions when a better option for customers would have
been to go into an occupational scheme.
The Securities and Investments Board, the financial watchdog, is expected to
publish on Tuesday its guidelines for how life companies and advisers should
compensate customers who have suffered from poor advice to take a personal
pension.
The original focus of its work was the possible mis-selling among the
500,000-plus pensions sold to people transferring a lump sum out of a scheme
run by a former employer. Concern about this aspect of pensions had been
sparked by a study suggesting that nine out of 10 cases examined did not
meet regulators' standards.
But the work expanded to include people who were in their employers' pension
schemes and were advised to opt out and start a personal pension instead.
Results of a study commissioned by the watchdog from consulting actuaries
Bacon &amp; Woodrow on 'opt outs', are expected to identify personal pensions
sold to 'non-joiners' as a problem in its own right.
Life insurance companies and advisers say that the number of cases where
people were advised to leave an occupational scheme to which they already
belonged is likely to be relatively low, because they would clearly have
been giving up contributions to their pension from their employer.
But they acknowledge that it would have been easier to sell personal
pensions wrongly to people who could have joined an employer's scheme but
had not done so because they did not check properly whether they would
qualify for membership.
A critical factor in determining the number of cases which have to be
reviewed and where compensation must be paid will be what SIB says about how
far sales agents and advisers should have checked whether a customer could
join an employer's scheme and whether, if the customer was eligible, the
advice was to remain outside the occupational scheme.
These cases of 'non-joiners' are likely to be hard for life companies and
advisers to identify from their files, which could make it expensive to find
all those who should qualify for compensation.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Papers cleared over price cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of Fair Trading, yesterday rejected
allegations that price cuts at The Times and the Daily Telegraph amounted to
predatory behaviour.
Sir Bryan said an OFT inquiry had not established a case for formal action
under competition legislation.
The cuts had had wide-ranging effects on other newspapers and did not appear
to be targeted at a particular title, the OFT decided.
'In view of the number of competing titles, it does not seem likely that a
predator would be able to recoup any losses out of supra-normal profits in
the future,' Sir Bryan argued.
At News Corporation's annual meeting in Australia earlier this week Mr
Rupert Murdoch made clear he intended to keep the price of The Times low for
the forseeable future to try to dent further the circulation dominance of
The Daily Telegraph.
The paper's average sales between April and September was 549,770, a rise of
46.4 per cent on the same period last year. Apart from a small dip in
August, the paper's sales rose in each of the last six months, reaching
607,143 in September. But the rate of increase may be starting to slow.
The 30p Daily Telegraph appears to be stable at 1.091m and has now been
above 1m for the past four months. The Independent has not made a
significant sales breakthrough and the average circulation for the six-month
period was 276,259, a drop of 17.78 per cent on the same period last year.
Since it cut its cover price to 30p sales have increased by about 30,000. In
August sales were 289,403 while last month they were 290,031.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Tunnel hit by further setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Channel tunnel project suffered another embarrassing setback yesterday
when a high-speed Eurostar train carrying the heads of British Rail and
Eurotunnel broke down, Charles Batchelor writes.
The Pounds 24m express train carrying Sir Bob Reid, British Rail chairman,
Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, and 350 other guests
developed a fault in the tunnel and was halted at Calais.
A replacement train was fetched but the travellers, including a party of 50
schoolchildren who had won a competition, were more than two hours late
arriving in Paris.
This is the third time in a week that a Eurostar train has broken down.
European Passenger Services, British partner in the railway consortium which
runs Eurostar, said early tests over several months had revealed very few
faults but new ones were starting to emerge.
It denied there was a design fault. The three breakdowns each had a
different cause with the problem yesterday traced to a mechanical fault.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Lloyd's agents to appeal in Gooda case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London agencies facing record claims for compensation from
members after the High Court judgment against them in the Gooda Walker case
are to go to the Court of Appeal.
The decision was immediately attacked by the Gooda Walker action group,
representing 3,096 Names, as a waste of time and money.
Mr Justice Phillips ruled on October 5 that the Gooda Walker agency had
taken 'culpable' and 'unjustified' risks and that the Names, individuals
whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market, should
receive compensation. The Gooda Walker action group estimated compensation
at Pounds 504m.
Clyde &amp; Co, the solicitors acting for the agencies' errors and omissions
insurers, which cover awards for negligence, said yesterday that the
judgment would be challenged with particular reference to the 'approach
adopted in assessing damages recoverable'.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said: 'Some
people don't know when they have lost. There is certainly no prospect of our
judgment being reversed on neglig-ence.
'Mr Justice Philips' principles of quantum will give us an estimated 80 per
cent of our losses. In our view the Court of Appeal is most likely to
maintain his principle or alternatively to increase the damages awarded to
us. This is a deplorable waste of the scarce financial resources of Lloyd's
syndicates. Spending further millions on legal fees neither helps the ruined
Names nor the Society of Lloyd's as a whole.'
Mr Deeny said that the decision to go for an appeal showed an 'irresponsible
disregard' for the best interests of the market. He predicted that the
appeal would be heard early next year.
The delay caused by the appeal is likely to increase the pressure from
hard-hit Names for interim payments to be made ahead of a final Court of
Appeal decision.
Yesterday the insurers intervened in the continuing High Court proceedings
over Gooda Walker to seek clarification on whether they were bound to back
agencies asked to make interim payments.
The insurers, out of whose funds any compensation eventually awarded would
be paid, also want to know if, in the light of the judgment, the Gooda
Walker losses arose out of more than one 'originating cause'. This could
affect the amounts paid under each agent's insurance policy.
A spokesman for Clyde &amp; Co said: 'These steps are not undertaken lightly.
Insurers have the benefit of detailed analysis and advice from leading
counsel which has been carefully considered in arriving at their decisions.'
The progress of the Gooda Walker case is being closely watched by other
groups of Names taking legal action against Lloyd's agencies.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Howard backs Rank plan objectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is backing environmentalists' calls
for a public inquiry into a plan by the Rank Organisation to build a Pounds
100m holiday village in Kent.
Rank says the proposed village, which would be built in 300 acres of
woodland near Folkestone, would bring 1,000 jobs to an area of high
unemployment.
It is strongly supported by the area's local councils, one of which voted
overwhelmingly earlier this month to back the project.
However, local environmental objectors have received the support of the
Countryside Commission and the Council for the Protection of Rural England.
The commission is opposed to the project because it is in an area designated
as being of outstanding natural beauty.
Rank, which also owns the Butlins holiday camps, says the village would be
screened from public view and noise from the site would be inaudible to
local residents.
The village, built on land purchased from the Forestry Commission, would be
a family resort similar to Center Parcs. It would have an 18-acre lake, a
covered water area, a golf course and 840 accommodation units.
Mr Michael Stickland, the project's director, said that although residents
would be deprived of access to the 300-acre site, Rank proposed to open up
750 acres of nearby woodland.
Kent county council's planning sub-committee said last month that the
economic benefits of the project outweighed the environmental impact. The
council is jointly controlled by Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
Shepway district council, which is Liberal Democrat-controlled, also decided
earlier this month to back the project by 41 votes to eight.
Although the district council is the planning authority for the area, the
project still has to be approved by Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary.
However, Mr Howard, who is MP for Folkestone and Hythe, has urged the
Environment Department to hold a public inquiry into Rank's proposals. In a
statement during the summer, Mr Howard said he had stressed to the
environment department 'the widespread opposition which exists to the
proposals'.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Inquiry told of Westminster's elector targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior Westminster councillors and officials set specific targets for the
numbers of new 'electors' required in each of eight marginal wards, the
public inquiry into gerrymandering allegations heard yesterday.
A fax was sent from the office of Dame Shirley Porter, the then council
leader, to Mr Graham England, the housing director, on March 1987 demanding
to know 'how does he propose to achieve the target voter figures in the
eight relevant wards by 1990?'
Both of them, along with eight other Tory councillors and officials, were
named in the district auditor's provisional report which found, after a
four-year investigation, that they had been selling homes to bring likely
Conservative voters into marginal wards before the 1990 local elections.
The inquiry heard that another of the respondents - Mr Robert Lewis, the
council's deputy chief solicitor between 1986 and 1988 - said the secret
plan for the marginal wards - known as 'key wards' - was well known
throughout the senior ranks of the council.
He had told Mr John Magill, the district auditor, in an interview that it
was like 'the love that dared not speak its name'.
Mr Andrew Arden, the QC for the group of Labour councillors and residents
who levelled the gerrymandering allegations, said council officials were
instructed by Tory councillors to compile detailed profiles of the
populations in each of the marginal wards.
He said these profiles were used to calculate the number of new residents -
described in confidential documents as 'new electors' - required to secure
victory at the local elections.
Mr Arden said the targets ranged from 450 in Millbank ward to 150 in
Victoria ward totalling 2,200 in all.
Another fax was sent on March 24 1987 from Dame Shirley's office to Mr
Matthew Ives, the council's chief solicitor. It asked whether the council
could sell off all the homes which became vacant in the marginal wards,
without affecting its statutory duties to house the homeless. Mr Ives warned
her 'anything which smacks of political machinations will be viewed with
great suspicion by the courts'.
Mr England had answered the same question by saying that the chance of being
surcharged by the district auditor was 'fairly tenuous'.

FT  22 OCT 94 / A stiff one for drinks lobby: Why it will be difficult to
persuade the chancellor to cut excise duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With one month to the Budget and two to Christmas, the debate over alcoholic
drink duties and cross-Channel shopping is becoming as clamorous as a
Saturday night pub 'discussion'.
'I've never seen a lobbying year like it,' said a senior drinks executive.
Wednesday brings the first public opportunity this season for advocates of
duty cuts to make their case. The Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association
(BLRA) is appearing before the first ever hearings on the subject held by
the Treasury select committee of backbench MPs. The committee, which has
received some 50 briefing papers on the topic, hopes to publish a report
before the November 29 Budget.
Brewers, along with distillers, pub and off-licence owners and other
interested parties, are taking a different tack this year. In the past they
have argued narrowly for a cut in excise duties on the grounds of equality
of tax treatment and as a necessary stimulus to trade.
This time their pre-Budget submissions to the committee and Treasury have
tried to quantify the wider economic and social damage they claim the rising
tide of drink imports is causing. Switching to the offensive, they have also
sought to show the broader economic benefits of a duty cut.
Cheap imports of lower duty beer from France now satisfy 3.3 per cent of UK
demand, equal to nearly 15 per cent of beer drunk at home, the association
estimates. As imports rise, pubs and clubs will be closed and jobs lost.
'The British way of life will have been changed and the pub-going habit will
be a thing of the past,' says The Real Alternative, the association's
submission to the Treasury.
Moreover, the 1993 lifting of personal import restrictions was 'a smugglers'
charter'. Vans coming back from Calais now account for one-third of all
duty-paid imports of beer 'and customs and excise investigators say that it
is a focus of interest for organised crime'.
The solution, the brewers say, is to halve beer duty to 15p a pint this year
and to the European median rate of 8p by 1997. The rate in France is only
4p. To assuage Treasury fears that the excise revenue lost could never be
recovered elsewhere, the brewers commissioned economists at the Henley
Centre to assess the wider stimulus of duty cuts.
Henley concluded a virtuous circle would prevail. People would drink more,
reversing a steady decline since 1979. This in turn would bring higher sales
of food, wine, spirits and other products in pubs. Higher sales would
justify higher investment to make pubs more attractive, pulling in even more
trade. By 1999, 58,800 full-time equivalent jobs would be created or saved.
Money saved on the unemployed plus taxes gained from higher economic
activity would more than make up for the Pounds 1bn cut in beer duty. The
impact on the public sector borrowing requirement would be positive by 1997
and bring a net gain of more than Pounds 1bn by 1999.
Duty cutters face a huge task to change the government's mind. Sir John
Cope, then the Paymaster General, said in April: 'If we were to sharply cut
the rate of duty, there is no way we would get back more than a fraction of
the billions of lost revenue from increased UK sales.'
The government is clearly sceptical about some of the claims made for the
inroads of imports. Sir John pointed out in April that beer duty rose in
1993, the first year of liberalised imports, to Pounds 2.41bn from Pounds
2.39bn a year earlier.
The association has taken every opportunity to press its case but brewers
acknowledge privately that their campaign could take some years to bear
fruit.
One problem is a lack of hard data on imports. Advocates of duty cuts have
extrapolated national figures from surveys and estimates. Working out how
much of the imported drink is for legitimate personal consumption and how
much is sold illegally to third parties is even harder to quantify.
Yet, the import volume may only be half the association's estimates,
according to Mr Ian Pressnell of Plato Logic, a drinks industry consultancy.
He bases his estimates on primary sources such as the volume of French and
Belgian beer production and the number of cross-channel vehicle and
passenger trips.
He and other critics of the drinks industry figures are also sceptical about
the extent to which a 15p cut in duty would encourage people to drink more.
Beer consumption has been falling because of changing habits rather than
rising taxes, he says.
Given the complexities of the arguments and the government's reluctance to
lose revenue or to gamble that a duty cut would stimulate the drinks
economy, lobbyists are trying a twin-tracked approach of tackling the EU as
well.
Duty rates vary not only between countries but also between types of
alcoholic drink, creating substitute markets and competing products.
Trying to encourage continental countries to raise their low duty rates a
notch may prove easier than persuading the British government to cut its
rates. But however strong the arguments are in London and Brussels, movement
in this Budget is considered highly unlikely.
With nine drink-shopping weeks to Christmas, bargain hunters had better make
their travel reservations.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Nationwide puts strain on Link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holders of instant access savings accounts with Nationwide Building Society,
the UK's second largest, will have to pay from next month to use cash
machines other than those run by the society itself.
The move to levy a 60p charge per transaction on these customers imposes a
fresh strain on the co-operative basis of the Link network.
It looks set to lead to the imposition of other charges. Halifax Building
Society, the UK's largest, already charges customers 60p for each
transaction carried out on a non-Halifax Link machine. Abbey National and
Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest, also charge.
The network was set up in 1987 enabling banks and building societies without
many cash machines to offer customers a more extensive system and so compete
more effectively with the larger clearing banks.
Initially the system involved no charge to customers while the Link members
paid each other for every transaction by one organisation's customer on
another organisation's machine.
Alliance &amp; Leicester Building Society, another large Link member, said
yesterday that against the background of the existing charges levied,
Nationwide's decision was causing it to review 'the commercial options
available'.
The charges imposed by Link members, discouraging use of other
organisations' machines, had already had an impact on the income it received
from the external use of its own machines, the Alliance &amp; Leicester said.
Link said it acknowledged the Nationwide move 'with regret'. The cost to
each member of the 31 organisations in the co-operative scheme was
'substantially less' than the 60p Nationwide was intending to charge, it
said.
If the charges mean that each organisation's customers increasingly make
less use of other organisations' cash machines, it will make the position
particularly difficult for Link members which have few cash machines
themselves and whose customers therefore make great use of other machines.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Consumer spending on credit and debit cards down in
September
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer spending on credit and debit cards fell in September, according to
figures released by the Credit Card Research Group yesterday, but the
decline was mainly due to seasonal factors, Philip Coggan writes.
The group said that card spending dropped from Pounds 5.02bn in August to
Pounds 4.68bn in September, although the August figures had been boosted by
bank holiday spending.
Figures for September's retail sales, published earlier this week, showed a
0.5 per cent monthly rise. The retail sales statistics are expressed in
volume terms and are seasonally adjusted.
Credit and debit card spending in 1994 has been substantially higher than in
1993, partly due to the growing use of cards as a method of payment. In the
three months to September, card spending was 17 per cent higher than in the
same period in 1993. Figures from the British Bankers Association and the
Central Statistical Office have also shown strength in personal sector
borrowing.
Over the past year, card spending has grown at a quicker rate among hotels,
the food and drink sector and other retailers. The slowest growth has been
in the entertainment sector. Debit card spending has grown faster than that
for credit cards, with the bulk of debit card spending occurring in
supermarkets and off-licences.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: City defence to stay for two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Corporation of London yesterday said it expected security measures to
protect the City from IRA attacks to stay in place for 'two to three years'.
Mr Michael Cassidy, the chairman of the Corporation's policy and resources
committee, said: 'The intelligence we have is that the IRA is continuing to
move weapons and equipment around, and the City of London remains a prime
potential target.'
While there has been a relaxation of armed police checks in London since the
ceasefire, Mr Cassidy said that businesses and the police remained in favour
of making a restrictive traffic scheme permanent and of continuing lower
profile searches of suspicious vehicles entering the City.
Mr Cassidy said the annual cost of these security measures of between Pounds
3m and Pounds 5m were 'totally manageable'. The corporation has an annual
rate collection of Pounds 700m.
The position taken by Mr Cassidy reflects a private consensus in the
security forces that the possibility of IRA terrorism resuming in the future
cannot be ruled out. In the case of London, there is the extra consideration
being given to the resumption of violence in the Middle East and the threat
of terrorist action by extremist Arab groups.
The government's conciliatory announcement yesterday is thought to have been
based on advice from MI5, the intelligence service, that the IRA's internal
discipline is holding around the ceasefire although the possibility of
maverick units carrying out a terror-ist attack has not been ruled out.
One senior anti-terrorist officer said: 'The situation is still too fragile.
Much as we'd like to say it's all over we cannot risk lowering our guard.'
Of great concern is the IRA's large stockpile of arms, much of which remains
hidden in the Irish republic. The armoury includes several hundred rifles
and grenades, numerous mortars, and enough commercial and home-made
explosives to provoke considerable tactical destruction on both sides of the
Irish sea for years to come.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Paisley calls move 'fresh IRA victory'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rev Ian Paisley condemned Mr John Major's speech yesterday and accused
the British prime minister, not for the first time, of reneging on his word.
In contrast to the warm welcome from across the community for Mr Major's
initiative to bring Sinn Fein into exploratory talks, a statement by Mr
Paisley - issued from the DUP's Belfast headquarters even before the prime
minister had made his address at the Europa Hotel  - described the speech as
'another victory for the IRA'.
If Ulster's jigsaw is ever to be complete, Mr Paisley and his Democratic
Unionist party represent one piece that still has to find a home.
There are no doubt some people in the province's isolated rural communities
who share this analysis. But as the peace process has inched forward, the
perception grows that it is Mr Paisley, rather than hardliners on the
nationalist side, who remains the obstacle to an agreement on a lasting
peace.
Mr Paisley has warned, often in apocalyptic terms, that the Downing Street
declaration and the ensuing peace process has put the union under threat.
He, more than other Protestant politicians, is implacably opposed to any
suggestion that Dublin has a role to play in Northern Ireland - the basis
for the cross-border institutions envisaged under the framework document now
under discussion between London and Dublin. As for reform of the 1920
Government of Ireland Act, this is almost an article of faith.
There are some who believe that Mr Paisley's deputy, the MP Mr Peter
Robinson, may yet emerge as the voice of reason in broking a way to bring Mr
Paisley in from the cold. But if that is the case, Mr Robinson's response to
yesterday's announcement did not suggest a change of heart.
Increasingly Mr Paisley appears out of step. While Mr Major has assiduously
courted the support of Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionists, he has made
little effort to win over Mr Paisley, whose intemperate outbursts,
culminating in his expulsion from Number 10 on September 7, have made him
appear increasingly isolated.
The tacit backing of Mr Molyneaux has been crucial in determining the pace
at which Mr Major has proceeded. Even yesterday, in a statement aimed
largely at nationalist opinion, Mr Major held out something for the
unionists, with the proposal to restore what he called 'local
accountability'. Dublin welcomed the proposal, but emphasised that this
would be part of an overall agreement.
Exactly how Mr Major's proposed assembly will be different from, and more
durable than, earlier failed experiments in local administration is hard to
imagine. Here again, unionists are split. The DUP has long favoured a
complete devolution of powers, but is boycotting the talks being held with
Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister. Mr Molyneaux on the other
hand has long argued that devolution is a dilution of the union and a step
towards separation.
The road to a successful agreement is still strewn with pitfalls. If the
main challenge for both Dublin and London is to get the Ulster Unionists and
the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party together, moving
ahead without Mr Paisley is fraught with danger.
It is doubtful that Mr Paisley and his supporters can cause the massive
union disruption of the 1970s strike. But the heady Paisley cocktail of
unionism and fundamentalist Protestantism still commands considerable
popular support, particularly in rural areas of Antrim and North Down, his
stronghold.
In Dublin at least, officials believe the next big hurdle to peace is to win
the acquiescence, if not the explicit support, of Mr Paisley. The danger for
Mr Molyneaux is that with Mr Paisley outside the process, Mr Molyneaux will
face a barrage of attack. If the peace talks fail, Mr Paisley could once
again emerge as the surviving stalwart of unionist interests.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Overall timing remains in doubt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of exploratory talks with Sinn Fein starting before the 'year
is out' is about the only concrete date in Mr John Major's speech to the
Institute of Directors in Belfast yesterday. The timetable from here is hard
to predict.
Mr Major and his Irish counterpart Mr Albert Reynolds are due to meet at
Chequers on Monday to inject new momentum into the peace process. The Irish
government in particular is keen to press ahead, and bring Sinn Fein into
the democratic fold, concerned that a delay could play into the hands of
hardliners in the movement opposed to the ceasefire.
Mr Reynolds expects to have his cross party Forum for Peace and
Reconciliation under way at the end of the next week. One view in Dublin is
that the forum may turn out to be a useful halfway house for Sinn Fein, in
its spell of democratic quarantine, while the painstaking verification of
the ceasefire and negotiation over surrender of IRA arms continues.
The next crucial date will be the publication of the framework document,
which will seek to outline what the Northern Ireland Office called the
'shared understanding on the elements of a settlement that is likely to
receive widespread acceptance by the people of Northern Ireland'. Officials
hope it can be concluded by the year end, although Mr Dick Spring, the Irish
foreign minister, said yesterday there were still differences on difficult
constitutional issues.
The forum is expected to sit through to the autumn next year. A UK general
election is due before summer 1996. If there is a change of Northern Ireland
secretary beforehand, that could delay the process for six months. With
local elections in Northern Ireland in the meantime, one view is that
substantive talks involving the British government and Sinn Fein may not
take place before autumn 1997.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Change is mixed blessing for workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ulster's so-called peace dividend will have mixed fortunes for Northern
Ireland's workforce.
While the Industrial Development Board, the province's main jobs agency, has
recently reported successes in attracting overseas investment, a number of
local companies are experiencing difficulties in securing orders.
Harland and Wolff, the Belfast shipbuilder which currently employs 2,000
people, has said recently it is prepared to build a ship at a loss in order
to protect continuity of employment.
Province-wide estimates suggest that employment in the security sector,
which includes the Royal Ulster Constabulary and private security firms
could fall by as much as 20,000.
Conversely, the tourism industry in Northern Ireland is expected to thrive
on the prospect of peace.
At present the industry employs about 10,000 people and is worth about
Pounds 130m to the local economy. It is felt these figures could double if
peace is genuine.
It has always been clear that the achievement of peace would lead to a
reassessment of public spending priorities in the province.
Yesterday the Northern Ireland Economic Council, in its Autumn Economic
Review made clear that the government should not consider removing money
from Northern Ireland.
Its report said: 'To argue that 'peace' will bring more costs than benefits
seems perverse in the extreme . . . What is important is that the adjustment
problems that will arise are dealt with carefully, sensitively and
gradually.
'With regard to the substantial opportunities that would open up in the
longer term, it is imperative that these are exploited to the full.'
The report maintained that the latest economic indicators appeared to
suggest that local manufacturing output was continuing to outperform
Britain.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Sinn Fein aims to unite in unarmed
struggle - Hardline elements could still jeopardise the ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An early public reaction from Sinn Fein vice president Mr Martin McGuinness
yesterday gave a broad welcome to Mr John Major's announcement as a further
step towards peace. 'A move in the right direction. It is quite clear we
must build up on all this,' he said.
However, intentions notwithstanding, there is no certainty yet that the
latest measures will banish for ever the prospect of a resumption of IRA
violence. This was the view yesterday of republican insiders who are
sensitive to the strains within Sinn Fein and the IRA after the IRA
organisation's ceasefire declaration seven weeks ago.
In the coming days, the Sinn Fein leadership will aim to reassure rank and
file republicans that Mr Major's announcements show there is political
advantage to be gained from a cessation of violence.
What Sinn Fein leaders have dubbed the 'unarmed phase of the struggle' has
paved the way for a reopening of border crossings, the prospect of
exploratory talks with the British government by Christmas and the lifting
of exclusion orders on Mr McGuinness and Mr Gerry Adams, the party's
president.
These measures have been high on the list of republican demands since the
ceasefire. But the Sinn Fein leadership realises that it has to continue to
be seen to be gaining political ground in the coming weeks if it is to
contain the restlessness of hardline elements linked to the IRA.
If and when it comes to talks with the government it will aim to secure
further concessions from the British government. At the same time it will
seek to avoid taking any further unilateral moves towards demilitarisation
which may risk a damaging split within the republican movement.
While the IRA refuses to hand its armoury over, British intelligence is
trying to keep a close watch on the movements of suspected terrorists.
And while some IRA 'volunteers' are thought to be enjoying a period of
peace, others remain determined not to allow their military efficiency to be
weakened by the peace process. The IRA may not be bombing, but its capacity
to bomb is firmly intact. Within republican circles, there has been some
optimistic talk - both before and since the IRA ceasefire - of a new,
strengthened nationalist consensus emerging from the current peace process.
At the same time, there is a sceptical view that the British government is
stringing the IRA along, holding out olive branches while aiming to
undermine the republican movement both politically and militarily.
Writing in the latest issue of the influential Irish political magazine
Fortnight, former IRA political prisoner Mr Anthony McIntyre says: 'The
ceasefire has come and gone, and the British have not gone . . . while an
imaginative step by the republican leadership, it will be a major
achievement for them to avoid this ceasefire being more disastrous than the
last. The lesson of history is simple: prolonged ceasefire sounds the death
knell for republican struggle.'
For the moment, there is little indication of the republican leadership
abandoning its public commitment to the peace process. Both Mr Adams and Mr
McGuinness are thought to still be holding the IRA army council to the
belief that any resumption of violence in the immediate future would torpedo
the chances of talks before Christmas.
But it is widely recognised that the next stage of the process will severely
test the limits of republican patience. In his public appearances in recent
weeks, Mr Adams has noticeably been increasing his demands for a withdrawal
of British troops. He has also been uncompromising on the question of
consent, rejecting the unionist position that Northern Ireland's future
should be settled by the people of the province.
After yesterday, the stage may be set for early talks between Sinn Fein and
the government. But republicans are gearing up for some hard bargaining from
which they expect results not defeats.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Ulster Peace Process: Major takes risks to boost confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recognition yesterday by Mr John Major that the IRA and its loyalist
counterparts intend a permanent end to violence was accompanied by an
extensive package of measures to restore normality to the province after 25
years of terrorism.
In his speech to the Institute of Directors in Belfast, Mr Major admitted he
was taking risks on the IRA's intentions after its refusal to spell out
explicitly that its campaign of violence had ended for good.
But he made clear that his aim was to create an environment in Northern
Ireland which would make it difficult if not impossible for the IRA to
return to violence.
Alongside the government's 'working assumption' that the IRA ceasefire was
intended to be permanent and its willingness to open exploratory talks with
Sinn Fein before the end of the year, Mr Major listed a series of immediate
confidence-building measures:
All border crossings between the north and the republic are to be re-opened;
The exclusion orders on Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein
have been rescinded. They are free to travel anywhere within the UK,
provided they remain committed to the democratic process. Other exclusion
orders will remain in place for the time being;
Troop levels will be reviewed in relation to the threat but the government's
'firm objective' is to return to exclusively civilian policing;
The government will enter 'at the appropriate time' into contact with
loyalist paramilitaries and consider how the interests of such groups can be
represented in the political talks process;
A conference in Belfast in December involving investors from Britain,
Europe, America and the Far East will aim to boost the flow of inward
investment into the province. A task force is developing a new European
Union initiative for Northern Ireland which will result in a substantial
injection of 'new money'.
The prime minister said that the proposed talks with Sinn Fein would rest on
the assumption that it continued to establish a commitment to 'exclusively
peaceful methods' and on the IRA's continuing to show it had ended
terrorism,
Over the medium term there could be no assurance of peace until the
paramilitaries on both sides had handed over their weapons. He intended to
develop a joint approach with the Dublin government on the 'deposit' and
'decommissioning' of guns and explosives.
In a reference to the demands of republican groups for 'self-policing' Mr
Major insisted: 'No groups will be allowed to take the law into their own
hands. All sections of the community must have confidence in the police.'
Turning to the framework document under discussion with the Republic to
establish new relations between the two governments and between the north
and south, Mr Major said it would be based on an 'unshakeable'
constitutional guarantee to the people of Ulster that they would decide
their own future. It would be a basis for negotiations rather than a
blueprint.
Meanwhile the British government would produce its own proposals for
devolution of political power to a Northern Ireland assembly. The
restoration of local accountability meant neither a purely internal
solution, nor a return to domination of one side by the other, would achieve
this.
Finally - and importantly - Mr Major reiterated that all proposals for the
province's political future would be published before any negotiations
between the political parties. The eventual settlement would be submitted to
a referendum in the province.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Mates may sue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Mates - the former Northern Ireland minister who left the
government over his links with fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir - is
considering suing some newspapers for libel.
Solicitors Denton Hall, for Mr Mates, said yesterday that a number of
articles had contained allegations of parliamentary or financial
irregularity or moral impropriety by MPs and some had referred to Mr Mates
in this context.
'Mr Mates takes the greatest exception to such inferences since at the time
of his resignation both the prime minister and the attorney-general
specifically stated that he had acted with complete propriety,' Denton Hall
said.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Trade gap with non-EU countries rises to Pounds 349m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exports to countries outside the European Union fell slightly last month
after a record in August, although underlying trends indicated a continuing
reduction in the trade deficit.
A fall in exports of aircraft contributed to an overall rise in the non-EU
trade deficit to a preliminary Pounds 349m in September from a revised
Pounds 289m in August, as export values fell 1 per cent on the month, the
Central Statistical Office said yesterday.
But on the basis of figures which exclude oil and erratic items such as
aircraft as well as precious stones, ships and silver, the trade deficit
eased to Pounds 364m last month from an upwardly revised Pounds 389 in
August. Export volumes rose 0.5 per cent and import volumes fell 0.5 per
cent.
In the three months to September the deficit of Pounds 1.02bn was the lowest
since the first quarter of 1988. Export volumes were at record highs in the
third quarter, up 3.5 per cent on the previous three months while imports
were up 0.5 per cent.
The growth in export volumes during the quarter covered all industrial
categories except fuels. In finished manufactures, the 1.5 per cent
quarterly gain was entirely due to an oil-rig accommodation platform sold to
Norway. A one-off sale of rapeseed to Japan boosted the basic-materials
category by 9 per cent in the three months to September compared with the
previous quarter.
However, sluggish demand hit imports of consumer goods, particularly cars.
Economists highlighted a fall in import prices during the third quarter and
said such price cuts could threaten the improvement in the trade deficit.
In the three months to September import prices excluding oil fell 0.5 per
cent compared with the previous three months.
Mr Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'Foreign
exporters to the UK are learning the same lesson that UK retailers have
learned - if they want to protect volumes they have to decrease prices.'
Analysts remarked on a fall in exports to North America, one of the most
important markets for British products. In the three months to September,
exports to North America fell 4.5 per cent compared with the previous three
months after rising 2.5 per cent in the three months to August. But the CSO
said this was mainly due to very high oil exports to North America in June.
Others said the growth in exports to developing economies was more
significant.
Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura, the Japanese securities house,
said: 'Almost all of the improvement in the trade deficit over the last 12
months can be explained by a bigger trade surplus with developing countries.
'So the argument that the UK is vulnerable to wage competition in south-east
Asia and other countries is proving untrue.'

FT  22 OCT 94 / Blair to pledge pensions overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair will next week attempt to shake off Labour's image as the
party of high welfare spending by embracing plans for a radical overhaul of
the state pension system and significant changes in social security
benefits, Philip Stephens writes.
A proposed shake-up of state pensions would allow the Labour leader to drop
previous spending pledges while sticking to a commitment to raise
substantially the income of the poorest pensioners.
Mr Blair plans to endorse the main principles of a report prepared by the
independent Commission on Social Justice which calls for a new drive to tilt
the benefit system towards work incentives and for the integration of the
tax and benefit systems for pensioners.
The report, commissioned by the late John Smith, will be published on Monday
after two years of study by a group led by Sir Gordon Borrie.
It will coincide with the publication by the government of its plans to
channel more people back to the jobs market through the replacement of
Unemployment Benefit with a Job Seekers' Allowance. The new benefit will be
paid for only six months and will carry a much tougher obligation on the
claimant to seek work.
Mr Blair will indicate that detailed plans must be subject to wide-ranging
debate within the party.
The plans include the taxation of child benefit for those in the higher-rate
tax band and an extension of student loans as well as endorsement of
Labour's plans for a minimum wage to prevent employers 'bidding down' wages
for benefit recipients.
But Mr Blair will embrace the central conclusion that a Labour government
should concentrate resources on moving people from welfare dependency to
work.
The planned pensions change, involving the establishment of a 'minimum
retirement income' for those entirely reliant on the state, would allow the
party to drop its past commitment to re-establish a link between state
pensions and earnings. That pledge involved several billions in additional
public spending.
By focusing on providing a 'top-up' for the poorest 2m pensioners through
the guaranteed minimum income, Mr Blair could justify downgrading the role
of the state pension in meeting the party's social ambitions. The proposed
switch, however, will attract Conservative claims that all pensioners will
be means-tested because everyone would be obliged to complete a tax/benefit
form on retirement.
The recommendations on promoting work rather than welfare are intended to
smooth out the poverty traps which discourage claimants from re-starting
work.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Waldegrave plans tough 'green' farm measures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Waldegrave, the agriculture minister, is discussing controversial
proposals to force European Union cereal farmers to adopt environmentally
friendly practices in return for the Pounds 8.1bn payments they receive each
year as compensation for cuts in grain prices.
Mr Waldegrave described the proposals - which would need approval from
Brussels - as a 'complete revolution' in how a large part of EU farm
spending is allocated. 'I'm sure it's right and sensible for farmers to
widen the base of their subsidy to take account of environmental
conditions,' he said. 'It helps to explain to the public why they are paid.'
He added there would be a lot of hard negotiating before headway was made on
the idea. He will also face opposition from British farmers who fear
environmental conditions would not be implemented by other EU countries,
leaving the UK at a disadvantage.
The NFU farmers' union said: 'Our primary concern is the extra cost such a
policy would impose on UK farming businesses when we are competing with
other European countries which don't have those costs.'
Britain has already imposed over-grazing penalties on livestock farmers as a
unilateral measure. Mr Waldegrave did not rule out applying environmental
conditions unilaterally.
Ministry officials met representatives of the NFU, the Country Landowners'
Association - which represents many farmers - and conservation bodies,
including the Council for the Protection of Rural England and the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, earlier this week to discuss how
environmental conditions could be attached to payments to cereal farmers.
The discussions centred on a scheme that would involve farmers protecting
environmental features of their land such as hedgerows, ponds, dry-stone
walls and wildlife habitats in return for subsidies. The Milk Marketing
Board said yesterday that it had secured a Pounds 30m loan from its bankers
for reorganising itself into a voluntary farmers' co-operative on November
1. The board had threatened to impose a levy on farmers to finance the
deregulation move if loan guarantees had not been forthcoming.
The Ministry of Agriculture yesterday gave its approval for live calves to
be flown from Humberside to Rotterdam to get around a ban imposed by ferry
companies on the shipment of live animals to Europe. Animal welfare groups
have protested against the flights of up to 200 calves in unpressurised
aircraft.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Fowler urges probe over MPs' interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A former Tory cabinet minister last night called for a wide-ranging
independent inquiry into MPs' outside interests as an influential Commons
committee prepared to consider the alleged non-registration of a 1987 visit
by Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, to a luxury Paris hotel.
Sir Norman Fowler, who stepped down earlier this year as Tory party
chairman, said the inquiry should be modelled on the Cadbury committee set
up to consider questions of corporate governance.
Sir Norman told his constituency association that it had been 'a bad week
for parliament' and action was needed to assure the public that MPs' conduct
was governed by 'proper and sensible rules'.
Sir Norman said: 'We do not need a committee of inquiry to tell us that
putting down questions for payment is wrong. That is self-evidently the
case.
'But it is quite clear that . . . some politicians do not intend to let the
matter rest there. We should not allow the agenda to be set by political
muckrakers. We should respond by recognising that there is legitimate public
concern.'
Sir Norman's remarks came as Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal Democrat MP for
Montgomery, made a formal complaint, demanding a Commons investigation into
Mr Hamilton's visit to the Ritz hotel on a trip alleged to have been paid
for by Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of both the hotel and Harrods, the London
department store.
In a letter to Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Tory chairman of the select
committee on members' interests, Mr Carlile said he wished to make a formal
complaint so that the matter could be investigated.
Referring to reports in The Guardian newspaper about the visit by Mr
Hamilton and his wife - 'at a total cost of allegedly over Pounds 4,000' -
Mr Carlile said the 'non-registration of that interest has . . . never been
investigated or ruled upon by your committee', despite 'reports to the
contrary'.
Downing Street said on Thursday that Mr Hamilton's visit had been looked at
by the committee. Tory party managers had been told by the chairman that it
was taking no action. But senior Whitehall officials have acknowledged that
the committee had not produced a formal report.
Mr Terry Lewis, Labour committee member, said yesterday that Bob Cryer, the
late Labour MP, had raised Mr Hamilton's hotel bill in committee but his
recollection was that there was no investigation.
Mr Carlile's letter will be discussed by the committee at its next meeting -
a date for which has yet to be set.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Growth slips in third quarter: Gross domestic product ahead
by just 0.7% as industrial production slows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A slowdown in industrial production caused the pace of economic growth to
slip in the third quarter of 1994, according to a preliminary estimate
released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday.
Gross domestic product grew a seasonally adjusted 0.7 per cent in the third
quarter, down from a growth rate of 1.1 per cent in the previous three
months. On an annual basis, GDP was 3.6 per cent higher than in the third
quarter of last year 1993. The annual growth rate in the second quarter was
3.8 per cent.
A decline in the pace of third-quarter growth had been widely expected after
figures were published earlier this month showing a fall in manufacturing
output in August. The decline may reduce the enthusiasm of the Bank of
England for further increases in interest rates - the pace of GDP growth in
the second quarter was one of the factors cited as being behind last month's
rise in base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent.
Mr Kevin Darlington, UK economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett, said: 'In
our view, the third-quarter slowdown is not a downblip in a still-fast trend
but the first sign that activity is set to decelerate over the next year.'
According to the Central Statistical Office, the service sector grew at a
quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.8 per cent, slightly higher than its growth
rate in the second quarter. The strongest service sector was transport and
communications, with air transport and telecommunications being particularly
robust.
However, the rate of growth in the production industries has shown signs of
slowing. The office said that over the three months to August production had
risen at a quarterly rate of 1 per cent, compared with a rate of 2 per cent
in the second quarter. There were signs that growth had slowed even further
in September. It was likely that, between the second and third quarters,
production grew by less than 0.7 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office said the slowdown in industrial production
was partly due to a weak engineering sector and partly reflected the effects
of the Milford Haven fire and other oil-refining problems.
Rising North Sea oil and gas production have been an important part of the
recovery. However, even if oil and gas are excluded, GDP grew 0.7 per cent
in the third quarter and was 3.2 per cent higher than in the same period a
year ago. Overall GDP is now 2.6 per cent above its pre-recession peak in
1990, or 1.8 per cent if oil and gas are excluded.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Backbench rebels threaten to scupper Post Office sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tory opponents of the privatisation of the Royal Mail yesterday stepped up
their campaign to force the government to abandon the proposed sale by
tabling a formal House of Commons motion demanding it be kept in the public
sector.
With a divided cabinet expected to decide next week whether to press ahead
with the sale, eight Conservative MPs signed an early day motion voicing
concern that privatisation would lead to widespread closures of rural post
offices.
The opposition of the eight MPs would be sufficient to overturn any
legislation in the Commons as the government holds an overall majority of
only 14. The signatures on the motion were led by Mr Hugh Dykes and Sir
David Knox and included Sir Keith Speed and Mr Robert Hicks.
Tory party managers have warned Mr John Major that several other MPs are
threatening to vote down the privatisation plan in favour of moves to hold
the Royal Mail and Post Office Counters intact in the public sector. The
rebels believe the government could meet mounting international competition
by giving the Post Office greater commercial freedom.
Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, and Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the
House of Commons, are both understood to have told the prime minister that
they could not guarantee sufficient votes.
However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, are insisting the government should face down the
rebels. The two ministers, backed by several cabinet colleagues, believe
that enough opponents can be won over to guarantee passage of the
legislation.
Cabinet supporters of the privatisation are arguing also that an
embarrassing U-turn over the issue would allow the opposition to brand Mr
Major's government a 'lame-duck' administration unable to win its business
in parliament. They believe some Ulster Unionists MPs, who are formally
opposed to the sell-off, might well decide to abstain on any key votes.
The UCW communication workers' union said yesterday that it thought the MPs'
motion would lead to the dropping of the privatisation plans.
Post Office Counters said yesterday that 178 main high street post offices -
a quarter of the total - will stay open until 7pm on Saturdays to sell
tickets for the National Lottery.
All other Post Office services will be available during the extended hours.
At the moment main post offices close at either 12.30pm or 1pm on Saturdays.
The extra hours will be worked by voluntary overtime.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Jaguar workers send a restive signal: Why observers fear the
car industry may be courting wage-driven inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jaguar car workers' sudden rejection yesterday of a two-year pay deal may be
partly due to the shop floor's alleged discontent over the introduction of
compulsory overtime work to meet rising orders.
But many observers also believe it reflects the first signs of a restive
mood across parts of the British workplace as the economic recovery gathers
pace and workers start to improve their bargaining strength.
Earlier last week Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry, warned member companies about the dangers
of increasing unit labour costs and urged them to keep a firm grip on their
non-wage employment budgets
The car industry in Britain - beyond Jaguar - is turning into a cause for
concern for those worried by the dangers of wage-driven inflation.
Both the Rover group and the trade unions remain confident that the
company's 28,000 employees will accept a two-year pay offer negotiated for
them last week.
This involves 3.7 per cent basic rate increases from November 1, with a
further 4 per cent, or the equivalent of the inflation rate if higher, from
November 1 1995. Rover workers with a full attendance record are to receive
payments of Pounds 150 in their pay packets this month through the company's
profit-share scheme.
The size of the deal has surprised some observers but it reflects the new
optimism in the group about its market prospects.
Two other car companies - Nissan and Peugeot Talbot - are due to seek
two-year agreements with their unions shortly and they are under pressure to
reach deals in line with that of Rover.
The rest of the vehicle sector is not involved in wage negotiations this
year. But Ford is due to increase pay by at least 3.5 per cent next month in
the second stage of a two-year wage agreement while Vauxhall paid out a 3
per cent improvement in September in a similar two-year deal.
Both Honda and Toyota have one-year agreements and neither expire until
April. This year their employees received pay rises of 3.7 per cent and 4.3
per cent respectively.
But the widespread use of two-year wage agreements in the car industry is
building leap-frogging tendencies between the companies. 'A 4 per cent rise
is already a benchmark for next autumn's negotiations,' said Mr Alistair
Hatchett, editor of Incomes Data Report, yesterday.
The steady upward pressures on pay are by no means confined to the car
industry. A number of settlements over recent weeks suggest rises are moving
above 3 per cent as companies adjust their offers under the threat of
industrial conflict. These include:
A 3.5 per cent plus Pounds 325 lump sum deal from October 1 for manual
workers at British Aerospace's plant at Woodford in Cheshire after a 24-hour
stoppage by operators.
Anglesey Aluminium has increased pay by 4.7 per cent at its Holyhead plant
after an earlier offer was turned down by the workforce.
Honeywell Controls Systems in Motherwell has reached a two-year deal with 4
per cent from this month plus 1.5 per cent next March and the next deal to
be from March 1 1996.
Employees at Westland Helicopters have received 3.25 per cent pay increases
after a number of groups staged one and two-day strikes. Britannia Airways
improved its pay offer for 1,400 cabin staff after a strike ballot vote with
a guarantee no rises would be less than 3 per cent.
Mr Davies sees this as a 'creeping' rise in the wages trend above the
inflation rate and level of productivity improvements.

The commission's recommendations on promoting work rather than welfare focus
on changes to the unemployment, income support, and family-credit benefits
to smooth out the poverty traps which at present discourage claimants from
re-entering the employment market.
Among the specific proposals is a scheme under which benefit payments would
include a 'guaranteed' element which the unemployed would be allowed to keep
when they took part-time or low-paid jobs. Another suggestion would be to
allow the jobless to keep all of their unemployment benefits for a limited
period after returning to the labour market.
The report is expected to recommend that a future Labour government retain
the principle of universality for the state pension and child benefit. But
it leaves open the option of extending the tax net to cover the latter.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Japan calls for intervention to support dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese ministers and businessmen yesterday voiced anxiety over the
dollar's latest decline, to a post-war low against the yen. Mr Masayoshi
Takemura, the finance minister, called for joint intervention by members of
the Group of Seven to support the dollar.
The US currency briefly touched a record low of Y96.55 in Tokyo, before
closing at Y96.68, its lowest ever closing price in Japan. Share prices
reacted calmly with the Nikkei down only 92.82 points to 19,899.08 and
government bonds strengthened.
Business groups repeated earlier worries that the dollar's fall will inflict
another blow on the yen value of export sales just as they were beginning to
see signs of an export-driven profits recovery.
The current exchange rate is excessive and will hit business confidence,
said Mr Masaru Hayami, president of the Keizai Doyukai executives'
association. Small and medium-sized businesses, which have not yet benefited
from the economic recovery, will be especially hard hit, warned Mr Masafumi
Onishi, chairman of the Osaka chamber of commerce.
The Bank of Japan, which intervened heavily in Tokyo trading, warned in its
latest quarterly report that the yen's rise would intensify deflationary
pressures, but said that the economy would stay on a recovery track.
The currency market upheavals would ensure that the pace of economic
recovery would be moderate, said the report. Demand for Japanese exports,
companies' progress in running down stocks of unsold goods and materials and
the impact of income tax cuts were the main factors supporting growth, said
the bank. However, bank lending was stagnating in spite of moderate growth
in the money supply.
Among the main constraints on growth, the report cited the yen's rise, Asian
competition and the decline in Japanese prices, plus companies' continued
need to reduce debts.
Mr Kagehide Kaku, director of the bank's research and statistics department,
warned that the yen's rise, while less strong than last year, would limit
Japanese companies' domestic investment plans. It adds to the pressure on
manufacturers to shift production to cheaper sites in neighbouring Asian
countries.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Clinton the peacemaker to visit Syria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JERUSALEM, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton will meet President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus next
week to push for a peace agreement between Syria and Israel. Mr Clinton met
Mr Assad in Geneva earlier this year, but his visit to Syria on Thursday
will be the first by a US president for 20 years.
Mr Clinton said Syrian involvement in terrorism was still a serious issue
for the US, 'but I do not believe that we can permit it to keep us from
pursuing a comprehensive peace'.
Besides watching King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of
Israel sign a peace treaty in Aqaba on Wednesday, Mr Clinton is also due to
visit Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
After a series of violent terrorist attacks against Israel in recent days,
Mr Clinton said it was important 'that the United States stand with the
friends of peace,' adding that he hoped his visit would move the peace
process forward.
Israel responded to a wave of rocket attacks on northern Israel yesterday by
shelling suspected Islamic guerrilla positions in south Lebanon. In the
occupied West Bank Israeli commandos swept through a Palestinian village
looking for a Hamas Islamic Resistance member believed to have masterminded
Wednesday's suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv bus in which 21 died. Israeli
soldiers also said they would demolish the home of the suicide bomber's
family.
Mr Uri Lubrani, Israel's co-ordinator for Lebanon, said there was no
evidence to suggest co-ordinated military operations between Hamas and
Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hizbollah or Party of God which sent five waves of
Soviet-made missiles into Israel. The missile attacks forced residents of
northern areas into bomb shelters but there were no reports of casualties.
The United Nations, meanwhile, protested to Israel yesterday over the firing
of anti-personnel shells packed with hundreds of steel darts which killed
several civilians in a village in South Lebanon. The UN said such shells
were banned under the Geneva convention.
Amid escalating violence between Israel and its Islamic opponents inside and
outside the Holy Land, a senior Iranian spiritual leader said yesterday the
Hamas bus bomb in Tel Aviv showed that peace pacts between Israel and Arab
leaders could not solve the Palestinian problem.
Ayatollah Ahmad Janati attacked the Palestine Liberation Organisation for
arresting Hamas activists. The PLO, he said, 'has turned into an Israeli
tool to suppress the Moslems'.
In Israel signs of the deep social divisions left after this week's bus
attack were apparent as right-wing Israelis shouting 'Death to Arabs'
clashed with peace supporters holding a vigil at the site of the attack in
the commercial centre of Tel Aviv.
Despite the continuing atmosphere of violence Israel reaffirmed yesterday it
would continue peace talks with the PLO.
The Israeli foreign ministry said Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister,
would meet PLO representatives in Cairo tomorrow.

A delegation from the City of London begins a two-day visit to Beirut on
Monday to promote British financial services. The visit is organised by
British Invisibles, a group promoting UK trade, which last week ran a
similar trip to Russia coinciding with the Queen's visit. The delegation is
headed by Mr John Manser, chairman of Robert Fleming - soon to open an
office in Beirut - and includes representatives from the London Stock
Exchange, Schroeder Asseily, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Samuel Montagu, Morgan
Grenfell, Baring International Finance and Credit Lyonnais Rouse. Mr George
Asseily, a Lebanese-born director of Schroeder Asseily, says the Lebanese
government could be aiming to raise up to Dollars 800m on international

The former head of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, sentenced
to federal imprisonment this week for bank fraud, pleaded not guilty
yesterday to related state charges. Swaleh Naqvi admitted the federal
charges and was sentenced on Wednesday to more than eight years in prison
and ordered to pay Dollars 255.4m in restitution. He pleaded not guilty to a
New York indictment dating back to 1992. His court-appointed lawyer, Mr
Brian Barrett, would not comment on whether Naqvi was negotiating with state
prosecutor Robert Morgenthau's office. Mr Morgenthau strongly criticised the
federal plea agreement as being too lenient.

had accepted the chairmanship of Billiton, the international resources
company purchased by Gencor from Shell in July for Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds
800m). Mr Keys was regarded as one of Gencor's most successful chief
executives and the announcement, at Gencor's annual general meeting in
Johannesburg, won approval from shareholders. It will help allay analysts'
concerns about the difficulties of consolidating Billiton's diverse
operations into a single company. It also ends speculation on Mr Keys'
future, after he stepped down as finance minister last month following two
years in office. Mr Keys, who will be based in London, said he was very
optimistic about Billiton's prospects.

FT  22 OCT 94 / More heat than light in Nepal power wrangle: World Bank is
worried about effects of a campaign against a hydroelectric scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The World Bank's ability to continue backing large-scale power projects in
the developing world is facing a crucial test as a result of
environmentalists' opposition to a proposed Arun III hydroelectric scheme
for Nepal.
The government scheme is being strenuously opposed by such non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) as the US-based Environmental Defence Fund and the
International Rivers Network, as well as the Arun Concerned Group of Nepal.
The IRN and the ACG have announced plans to file a motion before the Bank's
newly created three-member inspection panel. The motion will call for the
project to be shelved on the basis that it is 'in violation of Bank policies
and procedures'.
The motion will be the first to be handled by the panel, which was set up in
the wake of controversy surrounding the Bank's backing for the Narmada Dam
multi-purpose hydro project in India.
Under intense criticism by such groups as the IRN and Britain's Overseas
Development Administration, the Bank last year took the unprecedented step
of suspending its support for the 1,450MW dam and irrigation complex in
north-west India, which involved the resettlement of at least 100,000
people. This meant the suspension of the remaining Dollars 175m (Pounds
107m) of a total of Dollars 450m in Bank commitments to the scheme.
The criticism of the Indian project centred on the way the resettlement was
being handled, including claims of cruelty to those being resettled,
inadequate compensation, lack of Indian government compliance with Bank
project guidelines and lack of Bank enforcement of the guidelines.
Mr Joseph Wood, the Bank's vice-president for south Asia, in a recent
interview said the Nepal and Indian projects could not be compared.
Arun III calls for initial construction of a 201MW run-of-river
hydroelectric scheme, which will involve the displacement of only 155 local
families and will not require construction of a reservoir.
The fall-out from Narmada and the criticism of Arun are causing worry within
the Bank about its future involvement in large-scale energy projects.
Long delays to Arun might prove fatal, senior Bank officials admitted. The
Bank had already delayed financing approval several times as a result of
outside pressure, and now was hoping to get its board approval by November
3, by which time all financing from partner agencies should have been
arranged.
Under the proposal, the Bank would provide a 30-year, Dollars 140.7m loan to
the Nepal Electricity Authority. A further Dollars 34.3m is also available
under an existing Bank facility. A total of Dollars 473m would be arranged
through various bilateral agencies from France, Sweden, Finland, Japan as
well as the Asian Development Bank. The Nepalese would contribute Dollars
443m, bringing the total cost to Dollars 1.09bn.
Japan's contribution to the fund is crucial for the project but it is moving
cautiously because of its embarrassment over its involvement in Narmada and
is therefore conducting an independent assessment of the scheme. .
The protest groups want to delay the project beyond November 13, the date of
Nepalese national elections, and hope to see it supplanted by a more
environmentally compatible complex of smaller dam schemes around the
country, some as small as 10MW.
Mr Gopal Siwakoti, ACG spokesman, says his group was not consulted
sufficiently, parliament did not properly debate the project, and Bank and
government authorities been have slow to provide project documents. He added
that even if parliament was to approve the project following an open debate,
the group would still oppose the scheme in favour of its alternative plan
for smaller dams.
Mr Siwakoti added that the project was 150 per cent more expensive than
comparable power schemes elsewhere and would lead to substantially higher
tariffs.
Mr Wood, in response, said that numerous talks had been held in Nepal and
abroad. He stressed that the Bank was supporting what was a Nepalese
government proposal, not a Bank proposal.
He said that the NGOs' alternative power strategy would produce less
electricity and would not be significantly cheaper. There had been much
debate, both in parliament and in public, and the issue had been well
reported in the local media. 'Even the Communist party is not opposed to the
scheme,' Mr Wood said.
There had been some disagreement within the project evaluation team and the
original road design had been changed.
He emphasised that the country was now in the grip of regular power cuts.
The capacity of Arun Dam, to be completed by 2001, would establish a healthy
domestic power source, nearly doubling capacity from the current 241MW.
'This will make a hell of an impact on tourism, on service industries, light
manufacturing such as carpet-making and on agriculture. . . We want to see
more done with social infrastructure. We say electricity will help.'
The opponents have made it clear they will work to delay the scheme in hopes
of making it uneconomical. The Bank says that a one-year delay has already
added Dollars 25m to the cost of the project.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Brazilians wake up from a Real dream: The election over, the
consumer boom has been brought to a sudden halt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Millions of Brazilian consumers this week woke up from a dream they hoped
would never end. After several months of falling prices and easy credit, the
government announced a package of measures to clamp down on consumer
spending before inflation reignited.
Since the July launch of a new currency, the Real, Brazilians have stocked
up on goods ranging from cars to kettles. The Real reduced monthly inflation
from 50 per cent to less than 2 per cent. Consumers, who found their wages
were worth more, went on a buying spree.
Sales of TV sets in August were 75 per cent higher than in the same month
last year. Mappin, a large department store chain, saw sales rise 20 per
cent in September and the beginning of October. Poorer consumers found they
could suddenly afford canned soft drinks, which fueled a surge in demand
that has left supermarket shelves empty as Brazil has run out of aluminium
cans.
The government was happy to let the spree go on because it helped the
election chances of its candidate, Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who planned
the Real's launch. Once elected, the government was free to apply the brakes
and cool the overheating economy.
The package of measures announced this week mainly involved reducing the
period of credit for consumers. Families hoping to buy an oven or washing
machine could spread the payments over 12 months. Now they have only three
months to find the money.
By yesterday morning, the credit squeeze had started to have its desired
effect. Mr Abrahim da Souza, a salesman at a big domestic appliance retailer
in Sao Paulo, said his sales had fallen sharply. 'People are still coming to
ask for prices but when they hear about the new rules and the shorter credit
periods, they are going away without buying anything,' he said.
The government's other main target were the consorcios, or informal credit
organisations, which are common in Brazil and other developing countries.
This is how the consorcios work: A family which wants to buy a car, but is
not rich enough to get bank financing, goes to a consorcio organiser. The
consorcio needs 100 members who agree to pay 50 monthly instalments each.
Every month two members get their car, one by pre-arranged rota, the other
by drawing names from a hat. At the end of the period, all the members have
a car, and the consorcio organiser is left with a fat profit.
The government has now announced a ban on consorcios buying household goods
and imposed a reduction from 50 months to 12 months for consorcios buying
cars. . The results are likely to be dramatic.
According to the Association of Brazilian Consorcio Companies - which may
exaggerate the figures a little to lift its political clout - 3.9m Brazilian
families belong to consorcios. Last year the industry recorded sales of
Dollars 5.7bn. Before the new government measures, it had expected sales to
reach Dollars 7bn this year.
Mr Luiz Favean, who works for one of Brazil's biggest consorcio organisers,
Remaza, says sales of the cheapest cars, which cost about Dollars 9,000,
will be severely affected by the government move. 'With a 50-month payment
period, poorer families earning Dollars 700 to Dollars 800 a month were able
to afford a car, but now they are not,' he said.
In the Extra supermarket near Sao Paulo's Paulista Avenue, many shoppers
were angered by the new measures. One woman, who had been mulling over
buying a fridge using the store's consorcio organiser, reacted with
frustration then resignation when told that the government had banned new
consorcios from buying domestic goods. 'Our governments always stop workers
from improving our lives,' she said. Asked what she would do next, she said:
'Waste the money on the lottery instead.'
This is a popular complaint, and a dangerous one for the incoming president.
In recent years, each time a government has managed briefly to reduce
inflation, it has triggered a wave of consumer spending which has then led
to a clampdown.
Brazil has the one of the world's biggest gaps between the haves and
have-nots and poorer people may feel they have been tricked once again. The
dream period which coincided with Mr Cardoso's election campaign is over.
Brazil's consumers now face the hangover.

<TEXT>
The mayor of Seoul resigned yesterday after a 48-metre stretch of a motorway
bridge over the Han River collapsed during the morning rush hour, killing at
least 32 people, writes John Burton in Seoul.
City authorities were blamed for poor maintenance of the Songsu bridge
(pictured left), one of the most heavily used in Seoul.
Dong-ah Construction, Korea's third largest engineering company which built
the bridge in 1979, said the bridge may have deteriorated because traffic
use exceeded its design specifications. It said its legal responsibility to
repair any defects had lapsed in 1984. Several other bridges in Korea have
collapsed in recent years due to sub-standard work. The government may soon
allow construction supervision by foreign companies to prevent future
accidents. Authorities are expected to increase safety inspections of public
infrastructures.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Privatisation flop prompts rethink

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's finance minister yesterday confirmed that he is to review the
government's method of pricing shares in companies to be privatised.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura's announcement comes in response to the unpopularity
of the latest privatisation issue, Japan Tobacco, a cigarette making
monopoly. 'We must seriously look into the situation to see if there is any
problem about the way we have taken in the past,' he said.
The government has been left with 280,000 unsold shares out of the 666,666
it wanted to sell, a shortfall theoretically worth Y287.6bn (Pounds 1.8bn)
at the Y1.438m per share offer price.
Nearly 70 per cent of the small investors who were allotted the right to buy
shares forfeited their allocations because they felt they were overpriced.
This has brought to a head the growing criticism from Japanese as well as
foreign securities houses over the finance ministry's unique method of
setting prices for public share issues.
The ministry chooses the mid-price achieved in a pre-offer auction of one
third of the shares to be issued. Typically, institutional investors and
rich individuals tender for shares in this pre-offer auction, so that the
mid-price risks being higher than the valuation the remaining two-thirds of
investors would place on the company. The system was introduced at the end
of the 1980s to prevent frauds, in which companies about to be listed would
hand out cheap shares to powerful friends.
One alternative to the new rules, proposed by US and European business
lobbies in Japan, is to adopt the 'book-building' system used for most
international issues, in which financial advisers use their discretion to
choose a price after sounding out the main potential investors.

FT  22 OCT 94 / IAEA grapples with North Korea accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is to meet in
Vienna on Tuesday for a first informal attempt to decide whether and how the
US-North Korean nuclear agreement can be handled within the framework of the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
North Korea plans to remain within the treaty, from which it had previously
threatened to withdraw. But there will be a delay of several years before
the agency can have full access to its nuclear sites and before it can
examine spent fuel to verify how much plutonium the country possesses. This
would put it in non-compliance with the standard treaty agreement, the IAEA
said yesterday.
The agency's belief that North Korea had not disclosed the full size of its
plutonium stockpile and its inability to gain access to two suspected
processing sites sparked the row which led to yesterday's agreement between
Pyongyang and Washington. Neither problem has been resolved in the short
term.
IAEA members are likely eventually to endorse the deal, but this will
require complex legal drafting to ensure the precedent set by North Korea's
non-compliance is insulated from the rest of the non-proliferation treaty
and cannot be repeated.
'We're not oblivious to the wider importance of bringing North Korea into
the world community,' an IAEA spokesman said.
'We're not being doctrinaire, but the fact of life is that our organisation
is the guardian of the integrity of the system of inspection.'
Although the IAEA regards the North Korean case as 'a troublesome
precedent', its director general, Mr Hans Blix, also wants to make the
agreement a success as it does at least involve a North Korean commitment to
halt its present nuclear programme.
Some European countries are likely to have reservations at Tuesday's meeting
about appearing to reward with finance and new technology a country that has
flouted the treaty's rules.
Strict standards have been set in the past as, for example, in the early
1980s when Germany stopped construction of a nuclear reactor that Iran had
already paid for.
The main voices in the non-proliferation treaty remain the US, UK and
Russia. Once they have formed a consensus, other signatories, numbering some
160, would probably fall in line.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Wonder lightbulb saves energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US energy department officials are beaming over a new sulphur light bulb
they have helped develop which could prove 'a major technological
breakthrough in lighting'.
The new bulb, invented by Fusion Lighting, a Maryland company, and developed
under a government contract, is being tested at the energy department's
Washington headquarters, and could be commercially available next year.
It is suitable for lighting large areas, both indoors and out, can save
large amounts of energy, and delivers more and better quality light.
The light works by heating a small quantity of sulphur inside a quartz
sphere smaller than a golf ball with the same sort of energy produced by a
microwave oven. This produces as much light as 250 100-watt household bulbs.
In its test the energy department has replaced 240 mercury lamps at its
entrance with just two of the new sulphur bulbs, shining into opposite ends
of a 240-foot long 'light pipe'. The light is reflected down the tube,
escaping through holes at regular intervals to produce four times as much
illumination while cutting energy use by two-thirds.
Another test at the National Air and Space Museum shows substantial, though
less dramatic cost savings. It also produces much less ultraviolet light or
heat, both of which damage the museum's exhibits, than conventional lamps.
Because the sulphur bulb has no electrodes, its developers expect it to have
a longer life than conventional lighting, although other experts want to see
this confirmed in the tests.
'Light output does not diminish over time and the life of the sulphur bulb
is potentially limitless,' the energy department said.
The sulphur bulb also produces a white light containing all the colours of
the rainbow, closely simulating sunlight, unlike the harsh colours produced
by other electrode-less lamps generally used for street lighting, such as
sodium vapour or mercury lamps. The absence of highly toxic mercury also
makes a spent bulb much easier to dispose of.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Flamboyant Catalan faces survival test: A look at the
charges against Javier de la Rosa that have landed the Spanish financier in
deep water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Javier de la Rosa, the flamboyant Catalan financier who since Wednesday
has been sharing a small cell in Barcelona's Modelo prison, foundered in
deep waters before and came out swimming. But now he faces charges levelled
by mostly retired people of modest means who claim he has swindled their
savings.
These minority shareholders of Grand Tibidabo, the now bankrupt holding
company that Mr de la Rosa acquired in 1991, accuse him of rerouting at
least Pta3bn (Pounds 15m) towards his own private businesses.
Mr de la Rosa, 47, has swum away from the wreckage before. In 1985 he
resigned as head of Banca Garriga Nogues, a small Barcelona subsidiary of
the Banesto banking group, to start a private investment career. The
following year Garriga Nogues collapsed with bad debts of Dollars 800m.
In May 1992 Mr de la Rosa left Grupo Torras, the Spanish investment arm of
the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) that he had run for six years, and in
December the company, citing losses of Dollars 4bn, went into receivership.
The year before casting loose from the KIO, which is suing him separately
along with other former Grupo Torras executives, Mr de la Rosa began putting
together his own financial empire by paying Pta8.5bn in a public share offer
for 30 per cent of Consorcio Nacional de Leasing (CNL), a Barcelona leasing
company with a widely distributed small shareholders equity base.
Later in 1991 he had CNL buy 30 per cent of S A Tibidabo, a company he
already controlled, sold CNL's headquarters and its leasing business, and
transformed it into a holding company with the new name of Grand Tibidabo.
Last May Mr de la Rosa's chequered business career repeated itself. A month
ahead of Grand Tibidabo's general meeting he resigned as chairman of the
holding, saying he was willing to sell his stake in it for Pta1.
At the AGM Grand Tibidabo's directors announced that a revised audit had
established losses for the company of nearly Pta11bn, in place of profits of
Pta16m, and, during a six-hour meeting, they endured sustained abuse from
angry minority shareholders.
The chief cause of the shareholder hostility was their belief that Mr de la
Rosa had used their money in Grand Tibidabo to buy and sell, at a profit to
himself, properties that either belonged to him or to his associates and
that he had decapitalised the holding in the process.
What Banesto failed to do after the collapse of its Garriga Nogues
subsidiary - and what KIO has so far failed to achieve after the fall of
Grupo Torras - has been accomplished by lawyers representing some 500 of
Grand Tibidabo's 7,000-odd remaining shareholders. Mr de la Rosa is being
held in custody pending charges of falsifying public documents and
misappropriation of funds, which carry jail terms of up to 12 years. He was
ordered yesterday to post bail of Pta7bn to cover his alleged liability for
the losses of Grand Tibidabo.
Mr Joaquin Aguirre, the civil court judge who ordered Mr de la Rosa's arrest
earlier this week, said the financier must pay the money by Monday or face a
possible embargo of his personal assets.
The courts will decide whether the charges against him stick and the
investigating judge may still add new ones. But what has for the time being
put Mr de la Rosa behind bars in his home town is an odd combination of
high-level political infighting and of small-time investor hostility.
'People kept telling Javier that what would land him in jail would not be
the big KIO guns but the old widows who had their savings in CNL,' says a
Barcelona lawyer who monitored Mr de la Rosa's dealings. 'Javier has tripped
up because he refused to recognise that Grand Tibidabo had shareholders,
that it had to be properly audited and that it was subject to the scrutiny
of the stock exchange commission,' says a former senior employee of the
holding company.
Civil actions, like the ones brought by lawyers representing the group of
Grand Tibidabo shareholders, do not in themselves propel the chairman of a
failed company into custody. Mr de la Rosa was not, however, an ordinary
chairman and there has been a backlash against those who made speculative
fortunes during the late 1980s.
Politics lie close to the surface of the Grand Tibidabo affair as Mr de la
Rosa was close to the Catalan nationalist party that runs the Generalitat,
the Catalan government. The Barcelona prosecutors seized on allegations that
Mr de la Rosa had temporarily used Pta1bn of a Pta10bn loan to Grand
Tibidabo, that had been guaranteed by the Generalitat to develop a theme
park south of Barcelona, for his own private business purposes.
The prosecutors - Mr Carlos Jimenez Villarejo and Mr Jose Maria Mena - are
seen as being 'political' prosecutors who are staunch opponents of the
Catalan nationalist party. The two were involved in a long-running feud with
the Generalitat during the 1980s when they attempted to pin the blame for
the failure of a local banking group on Mr Jordi Pujol, its former chairman
and the Generalitat's chief executive.
Catalan nationalists say the prosecution of Mr de la Rosa is linked to
attempts to undermine Mr Pujol, who has frequently held the financier up to
be an exemplary Catalan entrepreneur.
Mr de la Rosa defiantly told a radio interviewer, shortly before his arrest,
that 'everyone had better be prepared to take their share of
responsibility'.
The whole affair takes the form of an Italian-style corruption scandal as Mr
de la Rosa is widely believed to have extensive dossiers on leading
political figures in Spain and has allegedly taped all his conversations.
The discovery of a Panamanian passport, bearing Mr de la Rosa's photograph
but with a false name, during a police search of one of his six offices in
Barcelona underlined the dark side of the financier's approach to business.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Greek central bank proves no place for a politician: A look
at events leading up to bank governor's forced resignation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A clash of personalities rather than policies caused the downfall of
Greece's central bank governor, Mr Yannis Boutos, a former economy minister
forced to resign last week in a dispute with the government over the future
of the loss-making Bank of Crete.
'The lesson for everyone is that you mustn't put a politician in charge of
the Bank of Greece,' said a senior economy ministry official.
The new central bank governor, Mr Loukas Papademos, promoted from deputy
governor, presents a model technocrat's image after 10 years at the central
bank, mainly as an influential but low-profile economic adviser.
Mr Boutos came out of political retirement to take over as head of the
central bank 11 months ago when the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok)
returned to power. But his personal friendship with prime minister Andreas
Papandreou failed to offset the mistrust his conservative background
inspired among senior socialists.
At one level, Greece's central bank enjoys considerable autonomy, setting
interest rates without interference from the government and managing
monetary and foreign exchange policy on its own terms. However, the need to
co-ordinate policy on financing Greece's huge public debt, amounting to more
than 110 per cent of gross domestic product, and the development of its
fast-growing but still primitive capital market means the central bank must
co-operate closely with the economy ministry.
'The governor shared our view on reducing inflation and gave us all the
backing we needed on curbing monetary expansion,' one government official
said. 'But he wasn't part of banking culture.' Tact is also needed to
maintain relations with the state-controlled National Bank of Greece, the
country's largest commercial bank which has a market share of close to 50
per cent of deposits but a heavy burden of non-performing loans. Senior
managers at National Bank, which issued currency until the Bank of Greece
was set up in the late 1920s, persist in seeing the central bank as a
comparative upstart.
Mr Boutos, a blunt-spoken economist from Sparta, had little in common with
Mr George Mirkos, governor of National Bank, a Pasok appointee whose family
have been executives with the bank for more than a century.
He recently rejected Mr Mirkos's demand for a Dr15bn (Pounds 40m) cash
reward for National Bank from the central bank for helping defend the
drachma during last May's currency crisis by raising short-term interest
rates above 60 per cent and turning down new loan requests.
Mr Boutos also raised difficulties over another attempt by Mr Mirkos to
boost his bank's balance sheet. The latter demanded that the central bank
should adjust exchange rates in National Bank's favour on foreign currency
deposits made by Greeks working abroad, dating from the time when the
central bank kept a tight grip on exchange controls.
The request was considered reasonable by central bank advisers, who are keen
to sort out apparent irregularities with Greek commercial banks in
preparation for meeting the Maastricht requirements for a single European
currency.
However, concern was voiced over the inflationary effects of injecting some
Dr300bn of liquidity into the banking system as a result of a one-off
exchange rate adjustment.
It was Mr Boutos's decision last month to liquidate Arab Hellenic Bank, a
struggling consortium bank set up in the 1970s by National Bank with Libyan
and Kuwaiti partners, that particularly irked Mr Mirkos.
The state-owned Libyan Arab Bank had offered to cover a planned Dr3bn
capital increase for Arab Hellenic Bank. This would have given the Libyans
control of a Greece-based bank, enabling them to open branches in the EU
under single market rules while remaining under Bank of Greece supervision.
The deal hung fire for more than a year before the US precipitated Mr
Boutos's intervention by threatening to include Arab Hellenic Bank in its
ban on financial transactions with Libyan nationals.
While Mr Boutos's abrasive style annoyed other bankers, his decision-making
could not be faulted until it came to privatising the Bank of Crete, under
central bank supervision as a Dollars 200m (Pounds 126.5m) embezzlement
scandal had been revealed there in 1988.
The socialist government is particularly sensitive about the Bank of Crete
because its owner, Mr George Koskotas, now serving a prison sentence for
fraud for his part in the scandal, claimed he was blackmailed by Pasok
officials into providing funds for the party. The allegations contributed to
the socialists' fall from power in 1989.
Ignoring advice from Pasok, Mr Boutos sacked the commissioner of the bank,
Mr Kostas Kalivianakis, on the grounds that he was obstructing the
privatisation process. Moreover, Bank of Crete's losses had soared from
Dr1.2bn in 1993 to Dr3.2bn for the first half of this year.
A government official said: 'Because of its past, decisions on the Bank of
Crete disposal have to be reached by consensus and carried out
transparently.'
Mr Boutos's mistake was to appoint as the new commissioner, without
consultation, Mr Michalis Sortikos, a private-sector financier reportedly
involved in an attempted takeover of a private Greek bank earlier this
month. This raised questions over a conflict of interest. When news of the
decision reached the premier's office, Mr Boutos was asked to resign.

FT  22 OCT 94 / German interest rate hopes hit: September's money supply
growth continues deceleration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's money supply growth continued to decelerate in September, but not
by enough to encourage hopes of further interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank
over the next few weeks.
The closely watched M3 monetary indicator rose at an annualised rate of 7.7
per cent last month. Some economists had expected it to show a more marked
slowdown, now that the distortions which caused it to grow more sharply
earlier this year have been ironed out.
The latest M3 figure 'will reduce market hopes for a further rate cut,' said
Mr Stephen King, economist at James Capel in London. 'With relatively high
levels of capacity utilisation and strong export and investment growth,
there is no real case for rates to be reduced again in the current cycle.'
The Bundesbank last reduced rates in May by half a percentage point,
bringing the discount rate down to 4.5 per cent and the Lombard rate to 6
per cent. This helped move money out of short-term deposits (included in M3)
and into longer term funds.
Recently, Bundesbank directors have made clear they see no immediate case
for further interest rate reductions, especially with the strong economic
revival.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, bank president, said this week the bank wanted to keep
money market rates stable in the face of international volatility. The next
Bundesbank council meeting is on Thursday. The bank said the introduction of
money market funds into Germany had had some impact on the slower M3 trend
but this should not be exaggerated.
About DM5bn (Pounds 2bn) flowed into foreign-based money market funds in
August and DM3bn in September; a further DM1.2bn went into German-registered
funds.
Not all of this came from assets in the M3 definition, however. Some came
from abroad and some was switched from bond holdings by investors nervous
about long-term interest rate trends.
'M3 would have grown somewhat more strongly without money market funds, but
the difference cannot be specified from information provided by the
Bundesbank,' said Mr Richard Reid, an economist with UBS, the Swiss bank.
He, too, thought M3 had not slowed enough to prompt a rate cut at the next
two fortnightly council meetings.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Swedish forestry companies join forces to urge EU membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's top four forestry companies yesterday joined forces to warn that
investment in Sweden would be threatened if the country voted against
joining the European Union in a referendum on November 13.
In a joint newspaper article, the chief executives of Stora, Europe's
biggest forestry company, SCA, the continent's third biggest, Modo and
Assidoman said EU membership was vital for Sweden's forestry industry, which
has many production facilities as well as its main markets in the Union.
'We want to invest in Sweden, but. . . if Sweden stands outside the EU it
will likely lead to many internationally orientated companies choosing to
invest in production inside the EU's borders,' wrote the four, whose
companies together employ 90,000 people in Sweden and abroad and have
combined annual sales of SKr115bn (Pounds 9.8bn).
The article was similar to a public warning against tax increases issued by
four senior industrialists before last month's general election. But it is
far from clear that such interventions by business leaders in political
campaigns have the desired effect. The election warning was aimed chiefly at
the Social Democratic party, but the party went on to win the election.
Many of the Social Democrat candidates and supporters proclaimed that the
country's large industrial companies, most of which are making big profits
this year, should not only pay more taxes but should also bear directly some
of the costs of Swedish membership of the EU.
However, the latest opinion polls this week suggested that the Yes campaign
now leads in the EU debate. A poll yesterday in Dagens Nyheter, the
newspaper which carried the article by the industrialists, showed support
for Swedish membership running ahead of the opposition by 41 per cent to 34
per cent. The result showed a gain of five percentage points by the Yes
camp, while the No side slipped three points from a previous poll in
September.
Last Sunday, Finland became the first of the three Nordic EU applicants to
vote on membership. Final official results published yesterday showed
approval for joining by 56.9 per cent to 43.1 per cent, a slightly narrower
margin than initially reported by the authorities. Norway, where opinion
remains strongly against membership, is to hold its referendum on November
28.
The Finnish parliament will hold its final vote on EU membership on November
8 or 9, it was announced yesterday. The government is keen to secure
parliamentary approval, which must be by a two-thirds majority, before the
Swedish referendum in case a rejection of membership by the Swedes causes a
last-minute parliamentary revolt.
In Stockholm yesterday, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the prime minister, named Ms
Anita Gradin, Sweden's ambassador to Austria, as the country's first EU
commissioner if the referendum approves membership.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Kiro Gligorov of Macedonia has secured a new five-year term,
capturing 52.4 per cent of the registered vote in Sunday's presidential and
parliamentary elections, according to official results announced yesterday.
His opponent, Mr Ljubisha Georgievski, a theatre director backed by the
hardline nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Movement (VMRO), won
only 14.5 per cent of the vote.
Mr Gligorov, 77, a reformist ex-Yugoslav politician, campaigned on his
record of achieving a peaceful transition to independence and international
recognition.
However, a high percentage of spoiled ballot papers, many from districts
with a large ethnic Albanian population, indicated the tensions underlying
Macedonia's precarious political stability.
Official results of the first-round parliamentary vote were still
unavailable yesterday. The state electoral commission, in charge of election
procedures, said it was unable to produce full results as returns from some
polling stations were missing and electoral registers were incomplete.
The Alliance for Macedonia, led by ex-communists and backed by President
Gligorov, claimed it won more than 30 per cent of the vote. Unofficial
results gave VMRO about 13 per cent and the free-market nationalist
Democratic party about 10 per cent.
The Alliance said it captured 12 of the 120 parliamentary seats in the first
round. The Party for Democratic Prosperity, the main ethnic Albanian party,
claimed two seats.
Because of the confusion surrounding the poll, both VMRO and the Democratic
party are threatening to boycott the run-off vote for parliament, set for
October 30.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Bonn in call for continued support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany will continue to need Nato and US support for its defence because of
Russia's military strength and the uncertain prospects for democracy, the
head of the German defence staff said yesterday.
In a speech to the Royal United Services Institute, Gen Klaus Naumann gave a
strikingly downbeat view of the chances of stability or prosperity in the
former Soviet Union.
He described Russia as a country 'taking a giant step from feudalism to
democracy without ever having gone through the experience of enlightenment'.
'Stability and democracy are linked with economic prosperity, and the
Russian economy . . . is far away from recovery, and hence we should not be
too optimistic in our assessment,' the defence chief said.
He told the institute: 'In the presumably long process of disintegration and
reconstruction (in the former Soviet Union) we are likely to see further
reversals . . . and more violence than we are now seeing in the almost
forgotten wars of Caucasus.'
Gen Naumann said that even if existing disarmament treaties were observed,
Russia would still have more than 3,200 strategic nuclear warheads and an
army of 1.5m men which Mr Yeltsin had promised to supply generously.
He was presenting to the institute his country's plans to develop a global
rapid reaction capacity, including the ability to deploy one army division
anywhere in the world within less than a month. He stressed that Germany did
not expect to engage in such missions alone.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Ukraine to meet reform deadline
</HEADLINE>

   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Ukraine will initiate a series of tough macroeconomic reform steps, possibly
as early as today, to meet Wednesday's deadline set by the International
Monetary Fund to release a first Dollars 360m (Pounds 227.8m) credit to aid
the country's transition to a market economy.
The two most important measures involve liberalising wholesale and energy
prices and unifying the country's myriad exchange rates. These reforms, the
most radical since independence, would be the first implemented under
President Leonid Kuchma's western-tailored programme to overhaul the
country's economy.
According to Mr Vladimir Naumenko, deputy economics minister, Mr Vitali
Masol, the conservative prime minister hostile to reform, signed on
Wednesday night nine decrees liberalising prices and trade, indexing
pensions and wages and shoring up the social safety net.
Mr Naumenko added that the National Bank yesterday finalised plans to unify
the exchange rates. The decrees, likely to reassure western donors, mark a
rare consensus within Ukraine's government.
Mr Masol signed the decrees under pressure from Mr Kuchma despite his
criticism this week of plans to raise bread prices seven-fold, cut the
budget deficit to 10 per cent of GDP and unify exchange rates.
The finalising of the decrees will mean that Mr Kuchma will carry a stronger
hand to Canada next week when he urges IMF, World Bank and G7 finance
officials to help Ukraine cover a Dollars 600m balance of payments gap for
the fourth quarter and come up with about Dollars 5.5bn in assistance to
ease the economic transition.

FT  22 OCT 94 / CIS states inch towards integration: Summit adds to 'paper
trail' of agreements on co-operation
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 12 former Soviet republics in the Commonwealth of Independent States
took a tentative step towards closer integration at a summit in Moscow
yesterday, agreeing to form a supra-national economic committee.
But many of the states expressed reservations about this and other political
and economic agreements signed, and retained the right to opt out of CIS
accords.
These hesitations suggest that, despite the decidedly upbeat tone of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin at a concluding press conference, the CIS is
unlikely to be granted the authority to overrule national governments soon.
Mr Yeltsin also made a veiled attack on Russian advocates of tough fiscal
and monetary policy by strongly endorsing the bid by the embattled republic
of Tajikistan to rejoin the Russian rouble zone.
During yesterday's meetings the Russian and Moldovan prime ministers agreed
on the withdrawal of Russian forces from Moldova by 1997. Russia also pushed
through an agreement on protection of national minorities, which could
strengthen Moscow's efforts to speak for the 20m ethnic Russians living in
other former Soviet republics, but many states, including Ukraine, appended
reservations to their signatures of the agreement.
Mr Yeltsin, who expressed his satisfaction about the formation of the
Inter-State Economic Committee, in which Russia will control 50 per cent of
the votes and decisions are taken by an 80 per cent vote, admitted that real
economic integration had not been achieved.
Agreements on forming a payments union - which might require a curtailment
of national control over monetary policy if it is formed - and a customs
union were also signed, but no details were released.
Later the Ukrainian prime minister, Mr Vitaly Masol, told Interfax that
Ukraine would not join the payments union.
Mr Yeltsin acknowledged the difficulties, saying: 'Not all states are
equally ready to take part in the economic union, although all voted for
it.'
Since its formation in December 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union
the CIS has created an impressive paper trail of agreements but few have
actually been implemented. Mr Yeltsin, who held a private meeting with
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, praised the 'completely different
atmosphere' which now prevails in Ukrainian-Russian relations since the
defeat of former President Leonid Kravchuk in elections in July. However,
privately, Ukrainian officials said Kiev remained unwilling to give up any
national sovereignty to CIS structures.
Mr Steve LeVine, central Asian correspondent for the Financial Times and
News-week, said yesterday the Uzbekistan authorities had refused to renew
his press accreditation. Mr LeVine said he was told: 'We think you are
against our president.' He will continue to report on the region from
Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Russian tax collection lower than planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the first nine months of 1994 the Russian federal government has
collected only 37.3 per cent of the tax and other revenues it counted on
receiving this year, according to a Ministry of Finance report released
yesterday, writes Chrystia Freeland. The report suggests that low rates of
tax collection have played a significant role in creating the fiscal crisis
that contributed to the crash of the rouble last week and prompted the
Russian cabinet on Thursday to adopt a more austere budget for 1995.
A 16 per cent decline in GDP - higher than the government had predicted when
drawing up the 1994 budget - and lower levels of inflation are, according to
Russian officials, partially responsible for the low levels of tax
collection. But economists believe that evasion and capital flight are
largely to blame.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Jaguar car workers reject 7.5% pay package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jaguar car workers have overwhelmingly rejected a two-year pay deal worth
7.5 per cent in a move that has shocked the company and the trade unions
that negotiated the agreement.
The decision aroused fears yesterday that discontent might spread to other
parts of the UK car industry as economic recovery increases the demand for
cars and strengthens employees' bargaining power.
Next week, unions covering 28,000 employees at the Rover group will announce
the results of a workplace ballot on a 7.7 per cent, two-year pay offer.
Nissan and Peugeot Talbot negotiate in November. Ford will raise pay by 3.5
per cent on November 24.
Both sides at Jaguar are expected to meet in the next few days to try to
revise the offer. If they fail to secure an improvement, the unions are
likely to call a strike ballot.
The Jaguar workers threw out the offer by six to four. The Transport and
General Workers union said it believed they accepted the pay element of the
negotiated offer, which increases their basic rate by 3.5 per cent from
November 1 this year. Next November, the company would pay a further 4 per
cent or an increase equivalent to the retail price index, whichever is
greater.
But the unions and the company believe workers dislike the requirement to
work 'compulsory' overtime on top of their basic 37-hour week. Under the
proposed deal, employees would have been expected to work overtime 'should
it become necessary to meet operational needs and/or maximise efficiency'.
Both sides are keen to avoid industrial conflict. Jaguar said it believed
there was still room for manoeuvre. A senior TGWU official added that the
union was confident that a settlement could be reached that would satisfy
the workforce.
The offer also guaranteed no compulsory redundancies provided the workforce
continued to back efficiencies, and gave greater security of earnings where
workers have to be laid off.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Fayed gave Tories Pounds 250,000 after Harrods takeover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohamed Fayed, the Egyptian financier whose allegations about payments to
MPs have thrown the government into disarray, said last night that he had
made personal contributions totalling Pounds 250,000 to the Conservative
party in the mid-1980s.
The contributions were made after he and his two brothers acquired House of
Fraser, which owned Harrods department store in London's Knightsbridge, in
1985.
Following the takeover, the government faced lobbying from the Fayeds'
arch-rival, Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive of the international group,
Lonrho, that it to should take action against them for alleged misconduct
during the Pounds 615m House of Fraser takeover.
According to Mr Michael Cole, a Harrods director who was speaking for Mr
Fayed, the funds were 'handed personally to Lord McAlpine', who was at the
time the honorary treasurer of the party.
The Conservative party said last night that it had a rule of never
commenting about personal donations, even when the donor himself discloses
payments. Lord McAlpine was unavailable for comment. However, Mr David
Blunkett, the former Labour party chairman, said the disclosure of these
payments was damaging to 'the democratic process'.
There was also mounting pressure last night for the resignation of Mr Neil
Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister named by Mr Fayed earlier this week
as one of two government ministers who had received payments for asking
parliamentary questions.
Though Mr Hamilton has denied the allegations, Mr Alex Carlile, Liberal
Democrat MP for Montgomery, called for an inquiry into Mr Hamilton's stay at
the Ritz, the Paris hotel owned by the Fayeds. He made his request in a
letter to Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, chairman of the Commons committee on
members' interests.
Mr Hamilton is alleged to have had an all-expenses paid stay at the Ritz. Mr
Carlile wants the committee to decide whether the trip should have been
disclosed in the register of members' interests.
Mr Hamilton's decision to stay in his post has been supported by Downing
Street, following a three-week investigation by Sir Robin Butler, the
cabinet secretary.
Mr Fayed's payments to the Conservative party have never been made public
because personal payments to political parties, unlike corporate ones, do
not have to be disclosed.
Lonrho, which also wanted to buy House of Fraser, alleged that the Fayeds
had not used their own money for the takeover.
Department of Trade and Industry inspectors were appointed in 1987. Their
report, not published till March 1990, concluded that the Fayeds had
'misrepresented . . . their wealth . . . and resources'. In spite of these
criticisms, no action was taken by the DTI to disqualify them as directors
of UK companies.
Nonetheless, Mr Fayed felt betrayed by the British establishment as a result
of the DTI criticisms, which he regarded as unfounded.
An attempt to clear his name through a review of the inspectors' procedures
through the European Court of Human Rights failed last month.
In 1989, Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, alleged in a
Commons motion that Mr Michael Howard, now home secretary, failed in his
duty to disclose a family connection with Mr Harry Landy, director of a
Lonrho subsidiary, at the time that Mr Howard was a DTI minister with
responsibilities which would have given him an interest in the House of
Fraser affair.
Mr Howard held this position from 1985 to 1987.

FT  22 OCT 94 / Dollar rallies on intervention hints
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar rallied yesterday after a week in which it hit a postwar low
against the yen and a two-year low against the D-Mark, write Philip Gawith
and Philip Coggan.
The rebound followed remarks by Mr Lawrence Summers, undersecretary of
international affairs at the US Treasury, that the US administration would
intervene in the currency markets to support the dollar. The US currency had
dropped to Y96.50 and DM1.4880 in Asian trading, following comments on
Thursday by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, which reawakened fears the
US had returned to a policy of 'benign neglect' towards the dollar.
In late New York trading, the dollar was at Y97.11 and DM1.4993. The yield
on the 30-year Treasury bond breached the 8 per cent level yesterday before
receding to 7.98 per cent.
Investors are worried that the US Federal Reserve has not moved quickly
enough to raise interest rates and slow the growth. of the US economy. The
Fed is not expected to raise rates before the US congressional elections on
November 8.
With bond yields rising, The US equity market is having difficulty making
progress.
At the close yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 19.85 points
lower at 3891.30.
The weakness of US shares is depressing European equity markets. The FT-SE
100 index closed 30.4 points down at 3,032.8.
In Paris, the CAC-40 index was 1.35 per cent lower on the day while in
Frankfurt, the DAX index was 1.5 per cent lower in after-hours trading.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Leif Hoegh lowers forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Leif Hoegh, the Norwegian shipowner, reported a sharp fall in nine-month
pre-tax profit, to NKr136m (Dollars 20.8m) from NKr581m, and cut its
forecast for 1994 net profits by NKr50m to NKr200m.
It blamed the weaker result on reduced capacity and lower earnings by car
carriers and liner vessels; high operating costs; lost time due to
dry-docking; unrealised losses in the bond portfolio; and bigger than
anticipated losses by its Cool Carriers unit.
Group freight revenue rose to NKr2.14bn from NKr1.79bn, but higher voyage
and charter-hire costs cut operating profit, before depreciation, to NKr248m
from NKr463m.
Leif Hoegh said this year's figures were not directly comparable to last
year's, as Bona Shipholding, spun off earlier this year into a separate
company, is not included.
In addition, Cool Carriers, which the company recently acquired from
Bilspedition in Sweden, and Arcade Shipping, the Norwegian group which
acquired this summer, are consolidated in this year's accounts.
Net financial charges against accounts reached NKr24m compared with NKr12m
last year. Hoegh attributed this to higher interest rates which reduced the
value of its bond portfolio.
It said unrealised gains on shares and bonds, of NKr11m, had been reversed,
and that a further loss of NKr19m was charged against accounts.
Color Line, one of Norway's biggest ferry operators, yesterday reported a
near doubling of nine-month pre-tax profits, to NKr205m from NKr118m. It
said the full-year result would provide a satisfactory return on invested
capital for the first time since the company was established four years ago.
Group revenue rose slightly to NKr1.61bn from NKr1.38bn, held back by a
NKr130m increase in operating costs to NKr1.14bn. Operating profit shot up
by NKr100m to NKr466m, helped by a 12 per cent rise in passenger volume.
Following last month's Estonia Baltic Sea ferry disaster, new reservations
have been well down on normal levels for the period.
'Should this reticence in reservations continue for the rest of the year, I
would estimate a weakening in the result for the year for Color Line in the
region of NKr15m compared with our original expectations for 1994,' said Jon
Erik Nygaard, managing director.

<TEXT>
Safra Republic, the Geneva-based international private banking group
controlled by Mr Edmond Safra, said its consolidated net income jumped 28
per cent in the third quarter to Dollars 38.5m, or Dollars 2.17 a share,
mainly because of a sharp fall in loan-loss provisions.
For the nine months to September 30, net income rose 41 per cent to Dollars
119.8m.
Safra said its net interest income in the quarter was flat at Dollars 55.8m
and trading revenues tumbled 38 per cent to Dollars 5.1m. Net commission
income was down 6.1 per cent to Dollars 15.4m.
Radex-Heraklith Industriebeteiligungs, the Austrian refractories and
building materials group, returned to profit in the first half following a
large restructuring.
The group reported consolidated first half net income of Sch22.7m (Dollars
2.1m) compared with a loss Sch48.2m in the same period of last year. Group
sales advanced 13.9 per cent to Sch4.37bn.
Mr Helmut Longin, chief executive, said the group anticipated a 'modest
profit' in the full year and intended to maintain its 10 per cent dividend.
Losses at Steyr-Daimler-Puch, the troubled Austrian motor group, worsened in
the first half. The group, 71.2 per cent owned by Creditanstalt-Bankverein,
recorded a Sch200m loss compared with a Sch161m loss in the same period last
year.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trusts are heading once again for something of a performance crisis.
Their high and rising costs are no longer being obscured by bumper returns
on equities. Currently their performance numbers are looking soggier than at
any time since the 1987 crash dropped out of the five-year performance
records in late 1992.
Here's how the numbers look now for UK General trusts, on the basis of
statistics from HSW. The FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index (the broadest
measure of the London stock market) has produced a passable, if not
inspiring, total return of 55.9 per cent over the past five-year period to
the end of September. Yet the average unit trust in the general category has
returned only 29.9 per cent to the investor.
In fact, only one fund out of 80 in this category has beaten the All-Share
return over this period. It is the Schroder UK Equity fund.
The underperformance relates mainly to the steep cost burden being faced by
unitholders. There is a front-end charge of 5 (and sometimes 6) per cent and
an annual management charge of often as much as 1.5 per cent. Other costs,
such as those relating to portfolio dealing, are borne by the funds, and
often the managers in any case appear to lag behind the index because of
unfortunate stock selection.
Consequently UK general unit trusts have on average underperformed the
All-Share Index return by, in all, 3.9 per cent a year during the past five
years.
The average annual All-Share return has been an unexciting 9.3 per cent over
this period. Take off the 3.9 per cent and you are left with a bare 5.4 per
cent as the return enjoyed by the average unitholder - on typical funds such
as TSB General and Mercury General, which come just about in the middle of
the pack for performance.
Moreover, given that this total return includes income, the capital value of
the average UK unit trust has risen very little since 1989. Curiously, many
of the overseas funds appear to have performed slightly better than the UK
funds, perhaps because they have been able to exploit some better-performing
stock markets in the Far East and Europe.
But the World Index, held back by a dismal Japanese performance since the
end of 1989, has performed overall no better than the UK All-Share.
None of this appears to have greatly discouraged unit trust investors,
although the flow of net new money into units has eased a little in the past
few months. But they might bear in mind that the average annual net return
on a high-rate building society account has been 6.4 per cent during this
five-year period.
It is true that a period even as long as five years may not be
representative of the long-term picture. Only over terms such as 10 or even
20 years will the bumps be ironed out. But unit trusts need better market
conditions than this.
Curiously, the UK equity funds can no longer even keep up with the
Cinderellas of the unit trust sector, the fixed-income funds which invest in
gilt-edged and other bonds. The best fixed-interest fund, Framlington Gilt,
has outpaced even Schroder UK Equity over five years, and the average gilt
fund has beaten the average UK equity fund.
Should investors have been in boring government bonds all this time? Those
hot equity fund managers in the unit trust business have got a lot to prove.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): What's it
worth to part with Teddy? - Alternative Investments / TV has prompted the
reasonably affluent to collect items that have no artistic value but are
rare and evoke the past - even their own childhood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<TEXT>
Television programmes such as The Antiques Roadshow have much to answer for.
Battered Teddies valued for Pounds 20,000 or more; Dinky toys for upwards of
Pounds 5,000; old comics worth Pounds 15,000 - now everyone thinks that the
rubbish in their lofts is worth a fortune.
It is true that there has been an extraordinary change in what people
collect. Astronomic prices, and the demise of connoisseurship, has reduced
the importance of serious collectors of Old Masters, Renaissance bronzes,
early furniture and the like. These days, the new rich - and the reasonably
affluent - often set their sights on collectables, which carry no intrinsic
artistic value but are rare and evoke the past, often their own childhoods.
A sexy corset worn by Madonna on her last European tour two years ago can
now sell for Pounds 12,000 in the auction rooms. Christie's South Kensington
recently offered 10,000 computer games. Phillips is selling pre-war
television sets, estimating the 1937 HMV 902 at Pounds 2,000. A rare Leica
camera of 1931 has sold for Pounds 39,600. If there is a market for it, sell
it, seems to be the rule of the salerooms, who are always searching for new
areas.
Many of the most successful items in recent years, like vintage cars and
wine, were badly hit by the recession (although wine has recovered well),
but anyone who can suggest sectors capable of generating a turnover of
Pounds 1m-plus a year will receive a warm welcome. These days anything goes
 -there are already serious collectors of colourful telephone cards.
Of course, anything which suddenly rockets upwards in price can fall just as
quickly. Five years ago, rare models of Swatch watches approached Pounds
20,000; now, few people are interested in such items. Many will own examples
of objects which seem to sell well at auction, but which are actually
worthless. Take Dinky toys. Christie's recently set a new record of Pounds
14,300 for a set of eight pre-war Dinky cars. But not only were they in
their original box; they were also wrapped in the original purple cardboard
insert which supported their display in the shops. A similar set without the
cardboard sold for Pounds 7,000. Anyone with Dinky cars of the period which
have been played with, and show wear, possess nothing but a battered
childhood toy, unless the object is a one-off.
In teddy bears, the name that attracts the international buyers is Steiff,
the German maker, which started producing soft toys in the 1870s. But not
all Steiff teddys are valuable. One sold recently for Pounds 49,500, but
only because it was blue, made for Harrods, and exceptionally rare. However,
the bear market is fanatical, and growing; and English bears, produced from
1912 on by Farnell, can now make Pounds 4,000. Even 1930s bears from Chad
Valley and Merrythought are worth holding on to, even though their current
market price is probably only Pounds 200.
Toys seem to be a market likely to last: already Magic Roundabout sets of
the mid-1970s are appearing at fairs, priced at Pounds 300 or so. But they
must be complete and in perfect condition. Comics, too, have their fanatics.
A rare copy of the first 1939 edition of Superman sold for Pounds 14,300
recently, but in the same auction a Batman Number One failed to sell.
British comics are much cheaper, but like the similar market of football
programmes, prices are rising steadily. As in all such markets, condition
and rarity are paramount. The attraction is that very few items cost more
than Pounds 500, and most examples go for well under Pounds 50. Top price to
date is the Pounds 4,000 paid for the 1948 Beano which marked the debut of
Biffo the Bear. The appeal was that accompanying the comic was the original
art work for the strip. There is also strong demand for the bold graphic
design which characterised the art work of the Dan Dare comic, and for the
covers of cheap pulp fiction.
On November 25, Christie's in South Kensington introduces a new area -
street fashion. Clothes of the 1960s, carrying the labels of Biba, Mary
Quant and Ossie Clark come under the hammer, with a typical tunic and dress
of 1967 carrying an estimate of Pounds 150. There must be many wardrobes
heaving with such items, but to have any value they should be by the top
designers of the period, bear the original label, and remain in excellent
condition.
Bonhams has been successful with auctions of fountain pens; and a Watermans
'snake' pen of around 1900, one of only five known, recently sold for a
record Pounds 15,100. Phillips has just added to the well established and
strong market in sporting paraphernalia by holding a rugby auction in
Cardiff which was a great success.
All the main auction houses have a golfing memorabilia auction at least once
a year. A very early pre-1800 golf club can top Pounds 100,000, while a
feathery golf ball of the 1930s might make Pounds 30,000. But you can still
build up a collection of post-1880 clubs and not spend more than Pounds 50
on any item. Cricket is always popular, but soccer and tennis are building
up keen groups of collectors. There is nothing to suggest that sports
accessories will ever lose their appeal.
The same goes for pop memorabilia. Sotheby's held its first Pounds
1m-topping auction in this field in August. The Beatles naturally dominate
the sales, and original lyrics written by John or Paul usually make over
Pounds 30,000 - I am the Walrus soared to Pounds 45,800. Authenticated
guitars also do well: a Fender guitar played by Jimi Hendrix went to a pop
museum for Pounds 198,000. But beware of fakes in this febrile sector.
Of course, by their very nature, collectables are at the whim of fashion and
can fall in price even more quickly than they rise. A trip to a vast
antiques market, like the periodic gatherings at Newark, will indicate the
new collecting fields. There are always clubs of enthusiasts who swop
examples and spread the word.
Fairs also offer the opportunity to acquire more traditional antiques with
the potential to appreciate. The most obvious example is furniture  -
essential, practical and ubiquitous - and while modern and repro loses
value, good antique furniture quietly appreciates. Edwardian furniture, and
later, has overtaken Victorian as the new growth area and is still
inexpensive. Recently, good examples of the furniture of the 1950s have
risen rapidly in price.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): Past
performance can be a guide - How to choose them, 2 / A researcher explains
why he questions the orthodox wealth warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
There is a widespread view that it is virtually impossible to pick the unit
trust performers of tomorrow based on the performance of yesterday.
But many academics and analysts argue that this is not the case. There does
exist a relationship between past and future performance. Admittedly it is
not widespread, but it is there.
My first rule is to understand that the key to fund selection is to pinpoint
those funds whose past performances provide evidence of managerial ability.
Managerial ability is the critical determinant of long-run investment
success. It is also rare. In fact, it is so uncommon that the total returns
of most unit trusts are caused by a combination of luck and risk, rather
than skill.
Rule two, then, is to be sure that whatever is described as past performance
does in fact measure managerial ability and not luck or skill. In other
words, in order to judge the worth of a past performance, it is necessary to
be clear about the causes of that performance.
Unfortunately, the standard approach to this task simply takes a fund's
total return relative to its sector as evidence of managerial performance.
This is a mistake. When total returns are taken as the sole measure of
performance, all three of the causes of the total return - risk, luck and
skill - are rolled into one. But from the view of performance assessment,
only one of these - skill - is of any real worth.
Table 1 shows the top 20 funds from the International Growth unit trust
sector. They have been ranked in the standard way - offer-to-offer,
cumulative total returns over the five years to the end of August 1994. Now
look at column two, which shows each fund's volatility or risk (as measured
by the standard deviation of each fund's monthly total returns) over the
same five years. The range of risk profiles is huge. Column three, the risk
index, shows that the riskiness of these funds varies from 92 per cent of
the sector average to 163 per cent of the sector average - almost twice as
much.
The fact that the four riskiest funds in this group have four of the five
highest returns is no coincidence. It is evidence of how the fund has
achieved its total return. So my rule three is: always remember that risk
causes return. The widespread failure to understand this is one of the main
reasons why it is difficult to find a relationship between performance past
and future. The relationship exists, but it exists between managerial
ability past and managerial ability future, not total returns past and total
returns future. Rule number four is that returns must always be adjusted for
risk in order to measure managerial ability. Here's an example:
In Table 2, I have again taken the five-year performance of the top 20 funds
from the International Growth sector. This time the funds have been ranked
on the basis of their risk-adjusted or risk/return and the changes in rank
relative to the total return rank in table 1 have also been shown.
Risk/return expresses the amount of return that has been garnered for each
unit of risk. It is calculated by taking each fund's average month on month
offer-to-offer total return, and then dividing this average by the standard
deviation (ie risk) of those monthly total returns. Risk-adjusted returns
enable us to evaluate the worth of each fund's performance. If we know that
risk causes return, then, funds that have a very high risk/return can be
said to have less of their return explained by risk and more by skill. We do
need to know, however, at what point skill is more in play than risk; and
for that we need a benchmark.
The benchmark provides a performance standard with which we can measure the
impact of a fund manager's decision-making. An index, such as the FT-SE-A
All-Share for broadly based UK unit trusts or the S&amp;P 500 for broadly based
US ones, fulfils this role. Indices such as these produce total returns that
are the product of no managerial decisions at all.
Funds that are able to beat the index on a risk-adjusted basis, therefore,
can be said to have added value; if they underperform they have subtracted
it. It is virtually impossible to beat a benchmark or index without superior
information - in other words, skill. The sign of managerial ability, then,
is risk-adjusted outperformance of an appropriate benchmark over a five-year
period. This is rule number five.
Basing decisions on managerial ability also makes great sense, because,
unless something very important changes, skill is stable. This is rule
number six. Understand that, in order for a fund that has done well in the
past to do well in the future, the cause of that success has to follow a
stable pattern. (Remember, this will not show up in the sector total return
rankings).
Take a look at the charts 1 and 2. In Gartmore British Growth's case, the
starting point of the trendline in the chart is the five-year risk-adjusted
performances from December 29, 1986, to December 29, 1991; and for Perpetual
High Income it is the five years to December 29, 1992. The trendline then
shows the pattern of each fund's risk-return as a ratio of the FT-SE-A All
Share's risk/return for each rolling five-year period in the 31 subsequent
months to date for Gartmore British Growth and 19 months for Perpetual High
Income.
The key feature here is whether the fund's trendline is consistently above
the value 1.0. This value represents the risk-adjusted return of the FT-SE-A
All-Share. In both cases, although the risk/return jumps up and down a bit,
the value is always above 1.0; that is, both have consistently outperformed
the All-Share index.
In other words, the managerial ability of both funds has been stable. This
is the type of information upon which fund selection decisions should always
be based. By contrast, the performances of GT Income and M&amp;G Dividend are
consistently below 1.0; that is, they have been consistent value
subtractors, although something important is going on at GT Income. The
chart shows that it has been improving steadily since a new manager was put
in place.
The golden rule in fund selection is to base decisions upon evidence of
managerial ability that is stable. Unless something important gives, this
will ensure that the fund's outperformance of its benchmark in the past will
continue into the future. To base decisions upon relative to sector total
return rankings is just wrong-headed.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): Make it a
long-term investment - How to choose them, 1 / Switching can be as expensive
as buying and selling shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Choosing an outstanding unit trust is in many ways harder than picking
shares. There are over 1,500 UK authorised unit trusts to consider - and
that's without taking any account of the growing number of offshore trusts.
What's more, there is only patchy consensus on the best way of selecting
trusts. But here are some pointers:
Caveat emptor: Start by being aware of some common pitfalls. Picking a trust
at random is likely to be about as successful as selecting the Derby winner
with a pin. But the field is much larger, so your chances of being lucky are
correspondingly reduced.
Responding to a tempting-looking advertisement is nearly as chancy. Some of
the ads may relate to very good funds, but many are for brand-new funds, and
those for existing funds often lean heavily on the fund's place in relative
performance tables.
Too often new specialist funds are launched when a particular stock market
or sector has already risen sharply, and new investors join in after the
party is over.
Funds which do well enough to come top in any of the proliferating league
tables are often relatively risky, and likely to produce below-average
performances in different circumstances.
The basic flaw in this kind of approach to trust investment is that it is
expecting the impossible: consistent, outstandingly good performance. Most
experts suggest that a relatively consistent solid performance is the best
you can hope for.
One fund or many? One of the benefits of investing through unit trusts is
that it pushes a substantial investment task - stock selection - on to the
fund managers. But the investor still needs both to clarify his own
investment objectives and to decide how to spread his resources between
different types of asset (eg, bonds, shares, property, cash etc) and between
different countries or businesses.
If you want to keep your own involvement to the minimum, you can opt for a
single fund whose investment objectives appear to overlap with your own.
Managed funds, balanced funds and the model-portfolio funds run by a number
of different groups are all possibilities. These will normally have a wide
spread of different assets, and will aim to alter the emphasis of the
portfolio as market conditions and expectations change. The snag, of course,
is that not all the managers get it right. So careful selection is still
necessary.
An interesting alternative - for investors whose objective is simply to
invest in a particular equity market - is index funds, often known as
tracker funds. These hold shares selected on purely mathematical criteria in
order to ensure that the resulting portfolio will mimic the performance of a
particular stock market index. Turnover and costs are both unusually low.
And although such funds always do slightly worse than the index they track,
they do better than most managed funds concentrating on the same stock
market. Points to watch here are which index the fund is designed to track,
and what the costs are. The funds with the lowest charges should do best.
Picking individual trusts: If you are ambitious, interested and prepared to
work at your investments, you may prefer to pick your own portfolio of unit
trusts. But only do so if you are happy to take your own asset and sector
allocation decisions, and clear-minded enough to ensure that these fit your
objectives and risk tolerance.
You will find some suggestions for building a portfolio on page 21 of this
review. But remember that switching from one trust to another can be as
expensive as buying and selling shares. So pick your trusts with the
intention of holding them for the long term.
Fund analysts consider a number of different statistics, several of which
are explained on the facing page. And an increasing number of
fund-measurement services are now producing performance and analysis
services aimed at the UK personal investors.
A couple of them are planning to introduce star rating systems, based on
their statistical analysis, notably variations of risk-adjusted returns.
Such systems have been very popular in the US.
The analysts themselves do not claim that their systems will help you pick
the funds likely to do best in future. And most academics reckon that
attempts to base predictions of future performance on past performance are
vain. Good performance does not repeat itself, and even risk-adjusted
performance figures have no predictive power (but see John Cuthbert's
argument, opposite). The only past patterns which do appear to have any
value in foretelling future performance are bad ones: 'A really rotten fund
is likely to remain a really rotten fund,' comments Professor Elroy Dimson,
of the London Business School. John Bogle, a leading US fund manager,
agrees: 'The purpose of all this information is for greater understanding,
not for forecasting.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Emerging
opportunities - Investing for growth / A long-term view may justify higher
risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER TAYLOR

<TEXT>
The past year has seen the launch of a bewildering range of new and exotic
specialised funds for the growth investor. Most are invested in emerging
markets. As well as 12 worldwide emerging markets trusts, there are now five
Latin American trusts, two South African trusts and four Korean trusts. Some
offer good value. Many are purely attempts to jump on the latest bandwagon.
The Latin American ones have been star performers, producing returns of
around 50 per cent. But, for many investors, these funds are too
specialised.
The key to successful growth investment is to make full use of the freedom
you have to take greater risks and thus reap grater rewards in return. More
volatile high-risk investments, such as emerging markets, are ideal. On a
one-year or two-year view, they would be very risky investments. On a five-
or better still 10-year view, they offer the likelihood of higher returns
than from any emerged market.
The average unit trust investing in the emerging markets of the Far East has
grown 504 per cent over 10 years, compared with 337 per cent for the average
Japan trust, 278 per cent for the average North American trust and 386 per
cent for the average UK growth trust.
Investors must decide to what extent they are going to keep control of their
money, dividing it up among different specialised regional unit trusts; and
to what extent they are going to invest through more broadly-based funds,
and let the fund manager make the investment decisions.
If you invest in an international growth fund, the fund manager will
actively manage your money, switching between markets on your behalf. By
switching out of falling markets and into rising markets the manager should,
in theory, be able to enhance the performance of the fund.
The weakness of international funds is that the managers may not know each
market as well as a specialist. Consequently the specialist regional funds,
such as European or Japanese funds, tend to outperform more broadly based
international funds in their own markets. Hence the average international
fund has underperformed the average fund in most regional sectors over the
past 10 years.
Investors would often have been better off constructing their own
international portfolio from a range of specialist funds.
This gives you greater control over where your money is invested. For
example, a growth investor who feels strongly about the potential for
emerging markets might be happy putting, say, 30 per cent of his portfolio
into these markets, whereas the manager of an international fund might be
more cautious.
Also, using a range of funds allows you to pick the best manager for each
market. For example, you could chose, say, Schroder UK Enterprise or
Perpetual UK Growth in the UK. In the US, you might invest through F&amp;C US
Smaller Companies fund, and for emerging markets use the City of London or
Martin Currie Emerging Markets trust. All of these unit trusts are top
performers in their sectors.
If you decide to use a number of specialist funds, decide on a long-term
strategy and then leave your money where it is. By and large, it is unwise
to try and take short-term positions in markets through specialised unit
trusts. The cost of switching in and out of funds is extremely high at 5 per
cent a shot. The chances are that the cost of moving your money around will
come to more than you make by doing so.
Switching from one fund to another run by the same manager is cheaper,
sometimes costing as little as 1 per cent. So, for example, investors could
switch out of an equity fund into the same management group's cash fund at
relatively little cost, if they found themselves in a falling market. But,
as James Higgins of financial advisers, Chamberlain de Broe, points out,
many of the most successful growth investors among his clients have simply
invested in a quality fund, from a quality manager and stuck with it.
It often used to be said that investment trusts were better for growth
investors than unit trusts, because they offered the possibility of gearing
 -a way of increasing long-term growth potential by borrowing money, or
using derivatives such as warrants. It increases the risk of investing but
if, in the long run, the market rises sufficiently, the geared investor will
come out better off.
The Exeter Capital Growth fund is a unit trust which does make use of
gearing by investing in the capital shares of split-capital investment
trusts - a form of highly geared share which will tend to outperform a
rising market and underperform a falling market. The fund, at only Pounds
7.3m, is small but its record is good, being in the top 10 per cent of funds
over one and three years. This is a risky investment, but in the long term
could perform very well.
Exeter have also now launched a fund that invests in international warrants,
and Hargreaves Lansdowne one which invests in UK warrants. Warrants are a
form of long-term option which can provide a great deal of gearing. Both
these funds are interesting, but they have not yet had time to develop a
performance record.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): First decide,
then diversify - Building a Portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In building a portfolio of unit trusts, the first priority for investors is
to know what they are aiming for. Are they building for capital growth, or
for income? Are they prepared to take risks, or are they highly cautious?
Are they investing over a 25-year period, or for just four or five years?
The second question relates to diversification. Buying a unit trust, which
may own hundreds of stocks, is itself an act of diversification, but the
investor still has to be aware of the dangers of too concentrated a
portfolio, either in terms of a sector or of a management group.
Some groups offer ready-made unit-trust portfolios. Mostly, these pool the
funds of individual management groups. The snag with such funds is that few
managers have top-performing funds right across their range of products. So
the investor may end up with a portion of the group's top-ranking south-east
Asia fund, but a larger portion of its poor-performing UK smaller companies
fund.
One exception is the Portfolio Fund of Funds, which uses the analytical
expertise of the Fund Research group to select unit trusts from a wide range
of management groups. The idea is to pick only those that are likely to
outperform.
Even this is not a perfect solution, however. While the Fund Research team
may be expert at selecting the best-managed trusts in each sector, they may
not necessarily be as good at asset allocation - in other words, deciding
whether to keep 40 or 50 per cent of the fund in the UK. (That said, the
fund was top of its sector in the three years to September 1.)
An alternative approach is to buy one of the unit trusts offered by
private-client fund management groups specifically for the smaller investor.
One example is Mercury's portfolio unit trust, designed to replicate the
type of portfolio of stocks and shares offered to private clients.
But if you prefer to build up your own selection of unit trusts, how do you
go about it? Capital-growth investors are unlikely to want more than a tiny
proportion of their portfolio in bond funds. They should not exclude equity
income funds, however, which often have a good record of capital growth.
While they may want a fair chunk of their portfolio in the UK, they should
also look overseas. Here, it is probably wise to follow the lead of large
institutions, which always have some sort of holding in each of the US,
Japan and Europe. But unless you are likely to emigrate to one of those
areas, it is unwise to concentrate too much of your portfolio in one region.
The longer the investment is likely to be held, and the greater the
willingness to accept risk, the larger the proportion that can be devoted to
emerging markets (perhaps with an upper limit of 20-25 per cent). Only the
wealthy, or the risk-inclined, should dabble in single-country emerging
market funds.
Investors looking for immediate income will probably want to include a
proportion (up to 30-40 per cent) of bond funds. However, they may also want
to consider buying gilts direct, since this may be cheaper.
In general, income investors should be cautious about buying those funds
with the highest running-yield, for this may indicate that they are
following a high-risk strategy or are converting capital into income. It may
be better to look for trusts with a long-term record of increasing pay-outs.
Income should also be an important factor when choosing which unit trust to
put into a personal equity plan (Pep). It may be best to put the
higher-yielding trusts in your portfolio into the Pep, to maximise the
income tax advantage (capital gains tax is paid by far fewer people).
Higher dividend yields mean that UK funds are likely to form the main
proportion of an income portfolio.
When it comes to the number of funds and managers to be chosen, there is one
big constraint. Small investments of Pounds 1,000 or so tend to attract the
full 5-6 per cent initial charge. Someone who can put Pounds 20,000 into an
individual trust can probably negotiate a discount with the manager. Too
much diversification may be costly.
However, a portfolio of at least four or five unit-trust holdings is
probably needed to get some decent sectoral and managerial diversification.
The really sophisticated may want to choose different management styles: for
example, picking the fund of a manager who likes to buy undervalued stocks
on a low rating, as well as one who likes to buy growth stocks with high
price-earnings multiples.
Having established the guidelines, choosing the individual unit trusts to
make up your portfolio is an art, as much as a science. There is no
foolproof formula for selecting a top performer, although articles elsewhere
in this survey may help.
Two standard mistakes can easily be avoided. Top-performing trusts do not
necessarily stay that way. They may have reached that position by taking
high risks, by concentrating on a narrow area, or through the services of a
top manager who has since been lured away to another group. And
bottom-fishing, picking the worst-performing trusts, does not necessarily
work either. Some trusts recover; many more just stay bad.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24): An ally
against inflation - Investing for income / But be prepared for some ups and
downs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN REECE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who wants to enjoy an income from their investment portfolio needs to
recognise the threat of an old and persistent enemy - inflation.
Unit trusts can play a big role in seeing off this threat, by providing
income and capital gains that keep pace with inflation, thanks to the
convenient and low-risk exposure they offer to the world's stock markets.
But with these advantages come risks. There are no guarantees with unit
trusts. Income payments may fluctuate, and your initial capital investment
is exposed to the sometimes alarming ups and downs of stock-market values.
You may end up losing money, especially over short periods.
Stephen Lansdown, a director of independent financial adviser Hargreaves
Lansdown, says: 'The value of unit trusts will go down as well as up, so
investors must be prepared to ride the peaks and troughs of the markets. No
equity investment should ever be made without five-year view in mind.'
Even so, for investors who want to boost their incomings with investment
revenues and protect their capital, unit trusts can play a useful role.
Thanks to personal equity plans, unit trusts can also pay out their income
and capital gains free of tax on annual investments of up to Pounds 6,000
per person.
But investors should not rely solely on returns from unit trusts when
investing for income. The funds should be combined with building society
deposits and gilts, in a balanced income portfolio.
The income record of a number of unit trusts is impressive. Take the most
popular type of income unit trust, those investing in UK equities. A number
of the UK equity income funds monitored by the independent research service
Income Fund Analysis, over the past 10 years, have managed to deliver a good
record of rising income and capital growth.
The table shows the income yield that was available at the beginning of this
year from an investment made in the funds on January 1, 1984. For example, a
Pounds 10,000 investment in the N&amp;P UK Income fund, on 1 January 1984, would
have produced an annual income equivalent to 15.46 per cent to the
basic-rate taxpayer, or 19.33 per cent to a non-taxpayer as at 9 January
1994. And the original Pounds 10,000 had more than tripled in value even
after all the income had been taken.
Compare this with a Pounds 10,000 building society investment made 10 years
ago. The income paid out during 1993 in the form of interest on the initial
Pounds 10,000 investment would be worth about 5.08 per cent to a basic-rate
taxpayer, or 6.7 per cent to a non-taxpayer. Assuming that all the interest
is taken as income, then the initial investment will still be worth just
Pounds 10,000; but in real terms, after inflation is taken into account, it
will have diminished in value.
Although impressive, the unit trust figures mask the fact that income
payments from equity-based investments may not rise steadily year after
year. This is a drawback for investors who want a consistent, regular
income, especially in retirement. Income Fund Analysis has identified just
three unit trusts that have increased their income pay-outs every year since
1981, when it began its study. These are: Prolific High Income, Barclays
Unicorn Income and Kleinwort Benson High Yield.
Over the past five years, the picture is a little better with 16 funds out
of 126 enjoying an unbroken run of increased payouts.
Realistically, investors should expect to see some fluctuations in the
income payments from their unit trust holdings. This is why building society
deposits and gilts - perhaps index-linked to the rate of inflation - cannot
be ignored as part of a portfolio.
The level of income paid by income unit trusts varies considerably. Some
equity income funds pay low initial yields but pride themselves on steady
dividend increases, such as the Prolific fund.
Others pay out yields much higher than the overall stock market average.
These high-yield funds seek out anomalies in individual share prices which
manifest themselves in above-average yields. If a fund manager's ability to
pick such stocks is good, he should profit handsomely when the rest of the
market recognises the anomaly and buys the shares too, thus forcing the
price up. But this is a specialist and risky business, and returns can prove
volatile.
Other high-yield income unit trusts tend to mix equities with fixed-interest
bonds, or simply invest solely in bonds. While bonds will provide relatively
high income at the outset, they cannot increase their pay-outs, which are
fixed. In the past, bonds have also underperformed shares in terms of
capital growth in the long term.
Stephen Lansdown warns investors to check the make-up of a unit trust's
portfolio before investing, to ensure it reflects their investment
objectives.
A recent development has seen unit trust companies branching out into the
controversial and volatile derivatives markets, to engineer new income funds
which try to mimic high-income building society accounts or bond issues,
while maintaining and even growing capital.
Such funds are run by famous City names such as Morgan Grenfell and Foreign
&amp; Colonial. They are suitable only for people with an urgent need for a high
income (9 or 10 per cent a year) and who are willing to take some risks with
capital.
Income payments from unit trusts have been given a recent boost by a
relaxation in the regulations which now allow a trust's charges to be
deducted from capital rather than income. This allows yields to rise 1.5 per
cent straight away, although capital growth will be held back as a result.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23): A manager may
want to borrow - The Investment Trust Alternative / This is a benefit
enjoyed by the other type of fund - but heed the discount
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN LODGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With more than 1,500 funds, unit trusts might seem to offer more than enough
choice and cause for confusion. So why add to the pot the 300 or so
investment trusts available?
Investment trusts are the other main 'pure' investment fund on offer to UK
investors. 'Pure,' that is, in the sense of not being linked to a pension or
life insurance policy.
On first sight, the two types of fund might seem pretty similar. Investment
in UK shares, the Japanese stock market or a whole range of other markets is
on offer from both. You can even find unit and investment trusts bearing the
same name and managed by the same individual - for example, M&amp;G Recovery or
Baillie Gifford Japan.
But there are important differences that make one or the other deserving of
more attention, depending on circumstances.
The fact that many experienced investors - including most professional
investors - swear by investment trusts should suggest that they are at least
worth considering. Supporters quote a number of advantages. The two least
open to dispute are investment trusts' ability to enhance returns through
what is known as gearing (in laymen's terms, borrowing money to invest); and
their more stable fund structure (called closed-ended) which gives the
manager greater flexibility to invest and therefore to perform.
Among investment trusts, warrants and the capital shares of split-capital
trusts are the extreme ways of getting a geared exposure. But beware. In
rising markets, gearing is great. In falling markets, it means a double
whammy, increasing your losses.
Being closed-ended means an investment trust does not have unpredictable
inflows and outflows of money to contend with, unlike a unit trust. An
investment trust manager does not have to sell holdings when you sell your
shares. He can can take a longer-term investment view and can more safely
invest in assets that are harder to resell (called illiquid).
Emerging markets and direct property are two currently popular investment
areas that are relatively illiquid, and therefore where the investment-trust
structure should have the edge. If, for example, emerging-market investors
panic and head for the door in large numbers - say, in a stock market crash
 -the investment trust manager need not worry about having his portfolio
stripped of assets he would prefer to keep and at prices at which he would
not choose to sell. He can carry on managing his portfolio better.
Authorised direct property unit trusts are required to hold a good portion
of cash and securities, to guard against liquidity problems. But that
threatens to dilute the property returns. And inflows of money can also have
their problems. The performance of one unit trust, Barclays Unicorn
Property, has suffered as a result of being swamped with new money that it
could not invest at a fast enough pace directly in property.
Investment trusts have also been promoted on the back of lower investment
and management charges, as well as a better past performance record than
unit trusts. However, investment trust charges have, in general, been
drifting upwards. And unit trusts in tax-free personal equity plan (Pep)
wrappers now offer some very good value.
The better past-performance record reflects, in large part, a one-off
benefit from - in technospeak - a narrowing of the discount to net asset
value (NAV) that investment-trust shares trade at. But the danger of
investing now is that discounts may widen again, leading to underperformance
in the future.
The price of an investment trust share does not directly follow the value of
its underlying investments. It fluctuates, and is normally less: the share
is then said to be at a discount to NAV. That fluctuation can be a risk or
an opportunity. If an investor buys when the discount is narrow and it then
widens, he will lose out. If the value of the portfolio does not change, he
still loses money, and in a rising market a widening discount means a drag
on returns. If, on the other hand, the discount narrows then the investor
gains: his returns are boosted.
The average discount to NAV among investment trusts this year has been 10
per cent or narrower. Few analysts see much upside. In broad terms, the
biggest worries lie over specialist trusts at very narrow discounts or even
premiums. The recent ratings of many trusts investing in Japan or the
emerging markets have been seen as particularly vulnerable, for example.
That said, what is a risky rating for one trust might be of less concern for
another, even for trusts in the same sector. Buying at a premium to NAV
should virtually always be ruled out, however.
Unit trusts, in contrast, do not have this discount risk, because their
value directly follows the price of the underlying assets. That, and the
fact that they cannot gear up like an investment trust, means that for
equivalent funds the unit trust is considered the lower-risk choice.
Nevertheless, certain kinds of lower risk-seeking investor should also look
carefully at some of the different types of investment trust share on offer.
Those looking for a specific lump sum in, say, five years time with no
income might consider buying zero-dividend preference shares. Their return
comes in the form of capital gain, which for many investors can mean
tax-free.
Income-seeking investors might be attracted by income shares that pay a high
and rising dividend - 8 per cent, for example - while also offering your
original money back if held from issue to maturity.
One final warning: stockbrokers tend to talk more of investment trusts;
independent financial advisers prefer to push unit trusts. Investors should
beware that recommendations to go with unit or investment trusts are not
simply dictated by their choice of adviser.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Best routes to
a cheaper deal - Discounts / Be sure what you want, because most discount
brokers don't give advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN LODGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price wars tend to be good for consumers - and in financial services, this
year has been no exception.
Among unit trusts, cheaper investment deals have been the result. Unit trust
managers have cut initial charges, particularly on unit trusts in tax-free
personal equity plan (Pep) wrappers. Discounts during the launch periods of
new unit trusts have been commonplace. And there has also been a growth in
the promotion and awareness of further non-standard discounting.
The obvious route for tapping the last-mentioned is to buy through one of
the discount brokers which advertise in the personal finance pages of the
weekend newspapers and magazines such as the Investors Chronicle.
In addition, many financial advisers and stockbrokers who don't advertise
themselves as discount specialists will be prepared to consider giving them.
And even some unit trust management companies will cut special deals for
investors who invest directly instead of through an adviser or stockbroker.
Deals quoted by the discount brokers vary a little: 2 to 3 per cent is
readily available; any higher discounts they quote normally mean they are
combining their own discount with a standard deal on offer from the unit
trust manager.
Discounts negotiated with advisers or stockbrokers who don't set themselves
up as discount houses are likely to be smaller, as are special deals offered
to investors dealing directly with a unit trust management company.
Unit trust discounts generally come in the form of a discount on the normal
price of units. Alternatively, they may be presented as a reduction in the
unit trust's initial charge, 'free' units through what is called a boosted
allocation rate, or a cheque rebating some of the broker's sales commission.
But they all add up to the same thing: cheaper investing.
At any one time, unit trusts quote two main prices - an offer price, which
you can buy units at, and a bid price at which you can sell them back. The
difference between these two prices - called the spread - is generally
around 6 per cent and is the immediate loss you incur when you invest. A
discount shrinks this immediate loss. That means your investment has to rise
less far for you to be in profit.
If you get your discount through a discount broker or other financial
adviser, typically what he is doing is sharing his sales commission with
you. Sales commissions are normally equivalent to 3 per cent of your
investment. Hence most discounts are below this level - the adviser wants to
keep some of his commission. But he may be able to offer a higher discount -
say, 3 per cent or more - because he is being paid a higher commission, or
because part is a standard discount on offer from the unit trust management
company. Or because he is also being paid an annual commission - called
renewal, and typically a further 0.5 per cent - which is paid for as long as
you hold your investment. Discounting renewal commission is as yet unheard
of.
But just because many discounts are commission-sharing arrangements does not
mean going direct to a unit trust company will mean you come away with that
commission - effectively buying at a 3 per cent discount. Normally the unit
trust company will just keep this commission it would otherwise pay out to
an adviser.
Very few companies have a formal policy to offer non-standard discounts to
investors dealing direct. They worry about upsetting the financial advisers
who provide them with most of their sales. Some, however, will give
discounts if you ask or threaten to take your money elsewhere, particularly
on large investments of, say, Pounds 10,000 or more.
So what are the catches with discounts? Most discount brokers do not give
advice with their discounts - they are offering what are known as
dealing-only, or execution-only, services. So they are more appropriate for
investors who know what they want. Chelsea Financial Services, however, says
it gives free advice whenever requested, and other brokers say they are
prepared to negotiate on their advertised discounts for those investors who
want some advice. Nevertheless, for those investors who feel more in need of
a full financial advice service, a discount broker may well not be the
answer.
In addition, your choice of funds can be restricted, although most discount
brokers will offer something of a discount on pretty much any unit trust
that allows them commission. (Many also offer discounts on new investment
trusts, offshore funds and other investment products). There is generally a
minimum investment level required to obtain a discount: Pounds 1,000 is not
untypical. Bigger discounts tend to be available on bigger investments, and
it is less common to find a broker prepared to offer a discount on Pounds
50-or-so regular or monthly savings.
Many discount brokers offer telephone dealing, so delays in dealing are less
of a concern. Likewise all discount brokers should be regulated by the
Financial Services Act - but do check. That means you are covered by
ombudsman-type complaints schemes and by the Investors Compensation Scheme
should you have any problems. In general, however, you should be making your
investment cheques out direct to the unit trust management company, and so
should have little to fear.
One catch to look out for is discounts that are only available if you
subscribe to a newsletter or join a 'club'. In contrast, the discount
brokers mentioned below offer good deals with no strings attached.
Finally, investors should remember that charges, and therefore discounts,
are not everything: first and foremost you should pick a unit trust because
you feel confident it will outperform. Discount brokers offer good deals on
some very well thought-of unit trusts, but they also discount the unproven
and the investment dogs.
Some of the more established discount brokers include: London-based Chelsea
Financial Services (telephone 071 351-6022); Guildford-based Premier
Investment Management Services (0483 67766); Scunthorpe-based Unitas (0724
849481); and - specialising in unit trust Peps - The Pep Shop (0602 825105)
in Nottingham.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): Simplification
may not lift sales - Single Pricing / Investors are brighter than managers
think, says Damian Reece. The reason why they decide to buy units is fund
performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN REECE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine the scene. The unit trust investor has chosen a fund out of the
1,500 on offer, and prepares to buy his units. These, he discovers, are
formed by the trust manager at the creation price, but sold at the offer
price to the public who can subsequently sell them at the bid price, which
might or might not be the cancellation price.
Confused? Certainly, the unit-trust industry believes investors are put off
by these seemingly complex pricing rules. Plans to introduce a system which
uses just one price for the benefit of customers, whether they are buying or
selling, are being developed by unit trust managers and the Securities and
Investment Board (SIB). A single price, the industry hopes, will make unit
trusts more accessible and attractive, with a resulting increase in sales.
But not everyone is convinced. It is quite possible that single pricing will
make little or no difference to the way investors perceive unit trusts. It
could even lead to some investors losing money.
Roger Cornick, marketing director of the Perpetual group, says: 'The drive
for single pricing is somewhat misplaced. The current dual-pricing system we
use now works perfectly well.' Although Cornick is broadly supportive of the
theory behind single pricing, he believes it poses problems in reality.
First of all, the hope that a single price will automatically make unit
trusts a more attractive proposition is somewhat flawed. In general, the
price investors pay for their units is not relevant when they decide to
invest. People buy unit trusts for the potential performance a fund manager
can deliver.
Unit-trust buying habits closely track the ups and downs of the stock
market. Having a bid and offer price (a sell and a buy price in layman's
terms) has never stopped people buying unit trusts when they think the
market is going to perform well.
Nor are unit trusts price-sensitive. Notions of a unit being expensive or
cheap do not apply as they do with company shares, for example. Whether you
buy one unit for Pounds 1 or two for 50p each, you are investing the same
amount in each case. A fund manager can create as many units as he wishes,
so there are no demand or supply constraints affecting the price.
David Graham, head of marketing at Scottish Widows group, says: 'Single
pricing has been blown up out of all proportion. The majority of investors
are not interested in the difference between dual and single pricing.' In
fact, there are some quite real disadvantages for investors from single
pricing. It is SIB's determination not to allow these to creep into the
system which has caused the single-pricing debate to drag on for years.
The great advantage of the current system is that it is scrupulously fair
and, save for some irritating jargon which could easily be changed, quite
straight forward. Units are created at creation price and cancelled at the
cancellation price. The difference between the two is known as the spread,
which can sometimes be as much as 12 or 13 per cent. Because this spread is
so unattractive, fund managers take a commercial decision to narrow the
spread to 5 or 6 per cent, and they publish the result in the form of two
prices: one is the price investors buy at (called the 'offer'); the other is
the sell price ('bid'). If you were to buy units and then immediately sell
them back to the manager, you would lose 5 or 6 per cent straight away,
depending on how wide the bid-offer spread was.
The spread exists because most of the investments made by a unit trust fund
manager are in securities which have a bid and offer price themselves, such
as company shares. It also covers the fund manager's initial costs of sales
and marketing.
These two prices work on exactly the same principle that holidaymakers
witness when buying foreign currency. But according to popular belief in the
unit trust industry, most investors don't understand this concept with all
its alien terminology.
Single pricing will appear to get rid of the buy and sell prices and the
spread between them, and replace them with just one price. How that price is
calculated is the issue being so hotly debated. There are numerous answers,
with such unlikely names as 'swinging single pricing', or even
'semi-swinging single pricing'.
The most simple single-pricing method involves calculating a price mid-way
between the bid and offer price and quoting this to all investors, plus a
separate disclosure of the company's initial charge. The problem with this
is that people buying into the unit trust will pay too little as the
mid-market price would be below the real offer price, and people selling
units would get too much. Continuing unit-holders would therefore see the
value of their holding diluted.
An answer to this could be to allow the single price to swing toward the bid
price if there were more sellers than buyers, and toward the offer price if
there were more buyers than sellers. An alternative, being considered by
SIB, returns to the simple fixed single price struck half-way between bid
and offer. But in addition there would be a separate charge levied on
outgoing investors to compensate for any dilution.
One last complication is the arrival of open-ended investment companies
(OEICs). These will be available from next year and are expected to
supersede unit trusts as the main form of collective investment scheme. The
Treasury wants to introduce them with a single price attached. No one is
sure whether the system eventually chosen for OEICs will be mandatory for
unit trusts, or if the latter would be allowed to follow an independent
course - a prospect which really does allow for some mind-boggling
complications and mix-ups.
Ultimately, single pricing of whatever colour will make little difference to
the real reason why people invest in unit trusts - fund performance.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Jugglers' turn
for the limelight - Charges / The percentages may sound innocuous, but they
mount up over time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Unit trusts are the latest investments to have their charges brought under
the glare of regulatory disclosure. A consultative paper issued by the
Personal Investment Authority (PIA) in late September, calling for responses
by October 26, recommended adapting the method used by mutual funds in the
US.
This provides prospective investors with two columns of figures. Both
represent accumulated expenses and charges over several periods of years.
But one assumes that the investment is cashed in at the end of each
timespan, while the other assumes that it remains in place. The US mutual
funds use a notional investment with a standard growth rate of 5 per cent as
a basis for projecting future expenses.
The PIA proposal is that Britain's unit trusts should produce similar
two-column illustrations, showing the effect of charges at the end of years
1, 3, 5 and 10, but using a growth rate of 7.5 per cent - or 9 per cent in
the case of tax-free Pep unit trusts. Funds levying exit charges would have
to supply additional figures for each of the first five years, or fewer if
the charges were phased out before that point.
The charges and expenses are to be those actually applied by the unit trust
concerned, rather than an industry average or standard figure.
Finalised rules on disclosure of commission, as well as on charges and
expenses, are expected to come into force on January 1, 1995. But that is
assuming there is none of the recalcitrance among unit-trust management
groups plainly hinted at by Julian Tregoning, chairman of the trade body,
the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif).
'The disclosure of charges on unit trusts is already more explicit than any
other financial services product,' wrote Tregoning, in Autif's September
newsletter. 'It would be madness for us to throw away the excellent
reputation we have achieved in the public's mind by appearing to be
reluctant over the last few changes that will be needed to bring
comparability with other products.' He urged unit trusts to seek to resolve
any technical difficulties over disclosure 'openly, quickly and without
reluctance'.
But a certain amount of last-minute jibbing is probably inevitable, given
the way juggling with charges has lately become so central to unit-trust
marketing.
As currently declared to investors, typical unit-trust charges of 6 per cent
initially and 1.25 per cent annually may seem low, especially when compared
with the charges on life assurance policies. But over 20 years, those
typical unit-trust charges total 31 percentage points - more than double the
13.25 percentage-point 20-year limit in force before deregulation in 1979.
Investors who have been offered cuts in initial charges on Pep unit trusts
in the last few years have tended to face increased annual charges, which
leave the long-term total almost unchanged but allow the managers to afford
yearly renewal commission now practically insisted on by intermediaries.
Unlike renewal commission on endowment policies - normally a set pound
amount per year - renewal commission on unit trusts is an innocuous-sounding
0.5 per cent annually. But what makes it so popular with intermediaries is
the fact that it is based on the value of the fund at the time of renewal.
Present regulations do not allow differential pricing - different charging
structures for trusts sold direct and those sold through intermediaries. But
in a way, this does happen when management groups launch a trust or a Pep
aiming mainly for sales via intermediaries but attracting direct business at
the same time. The direct investor paying the same price and charges as the
intermediary client is, in fact, paying more in order to cover the cost of a
non-existent adviser.
The M&amp;G Group has taken Pounds 400m into its Managed Income Fund Pep, about
60 per cent through intermediaries, since February when it removed the
initial charge on the plan and introduced a sliding scale of exit fees for
investors cashing in during the first five years.
The Managed Income Fund is a fund-of-funds investing in M&amp;G unit trusts, and
Pep investors pay an annual charge of 1.5 per cent. But the annual charge on
the underlying unit trusts is as low as 0.75 per cent (M&amp;G Dividend), and
investors can put any of these trusts into a Pep independently.
Assuming no growth in the investment, it will take just over six years for
an investor who pays 5 per cent initially and 0.75 per cent annually to pull
ahead of another with the same investment who pays no initial charge but an
annual 1.5 per cent.
Geoffrey Mushens, of M&amp;G, locates the break-even point for investors
somewhere between eight and nine years into the life of an investment,
noting that most of the M&amp;G unit trusts carry a 1 per cent annual charge.
His calculation is also based on no-growth.
'Investors don't like to say they are going to be in for nine years, though
a large number do stay that long,' he said. On average, M&amp;G investors hold
units for seven years. And although Peps have only been on the market for
seven years, Mushens extrapolates trends to estimate that M&amp;G Pep-holders
will stay for between 10 and 11 years. Over that length of time, he says,
there is virtually no difference between a Pep with no front-end load and a
1.5 per cent annual charge and a plan charging 5 per cent to start and 1 per
cent a year.
Another use of charges in marketing became possible only in May, when the
Securities and Investments Board decided to allow some unit trusts to offset
all or part of their annual management charge against capital instead of
income. This gave managers a valuable opportunity to add up to 1.5
percentage points to the quoted yield of an income fund at a time of low
interest rates.
So far, both Mercury and Save &amp; Prosper have launched new income unit trusts
using the altered charging basis, and Schroder plans to convert an existing
trust next February. But a number of groups have reacted more cautiously,
weighing possible tax and other disadvantages.
Framlington managing director Anne McMeehan forecast that competitive
pressures would push newly-launching funds to charge fees against capital,
but thought groups like hers might be slow to alter existing funds. 'We have
to make sure we inform investors and don't upset them,' she explained.
Lewis McNaught, of Gartmore, said his firm would not make any immediate
move: 'We are not sure yet whether the full impact on capital performance is
understood by investors. Total return is such an important priority.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Simpler
charges, wider markets - Trusts continue to benefit from Peps, and low
interest rates have helped to win many savers from building societies. But
deregulation means potential upsets lie ahead

<TEXT>
Like the classroom weakling, who suddenly grows to tower over his
classmates, unit trusts are enjoying their relatively new-found stature.
The industry looks set this year to beat its own record Pounds 9.1bn of net
investment, set in 1993. By the end of August, net investment since January
had totalled Pounds 6.75bn, fractionally up on the Pounds 6.28bn for the
same eight months of the previous year. This is all a far cry from the
dismal years following the 1987 stock market crash, when net investment over
the five years (1988-1992 inclusive) amounted to Pounds 9.5bn - only
slightly above the total up last year.
Although the investment numbers are now getting better, from the point of
view of the industry, it faces three main challenges in the coming year.
The first test will be to deliver better performance. As Barry Riley
explains on page 31 of this Review, the average unit trust has delivered a
return of 29.4 per cent in the five years to the end of September against
the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index's total return of 55.3 per cent.
Secondly, unit trusts will be under pressure to sustain demand from new
investors as interest rates move back up again. It is no coincidence that
the popularity of unit (and investment) trusts has occurred against a
background of low interest rates - at the beginning of 1993, base rates
stood at 6 per cent, falling further to 5.25 per cent before the half
percentage point rise onSeptember 12.
Private investors have turned to equity-related investments over the past
few years, in the hope of bettering the modest returns they have been
getting at the building societies. For the first time, the number of
unitholder accounts rose to more than 6m in August - an increase of more
than one-third on January 1993.
Mr Philip Warland, director-general of Autif, does not appear too worried by
the building-society threat, arguing that saving habits have changed, with
more people investing for the long-term - such as for school fees or to pay
off the mortgage.
Finally, moves towards deregulation have led to greater flexibility for unit
trusts on charges and the range of markets in which they can invest. There
are more changes in the pipeline, which the industry hopes will give it
greater marketing flexibility and appeal to new investors. The difficulty
will be in making sure that this turns out to be the case, and that
investors are better off as a result.
The most important measures, which are to be implemented from next week,
include:
Exit charges: These have been in existence on some personal equity plans,
since Pep rules differ from those for unit trusts. Fidelity introduced a
tapering withdrawal charge over three years on its Peps in 1992, in
combination with an initial charge of only 2 per cent - instead of the more
common 5.25-6 per cent.
However, this early experimentation with exit charges has not proved
entirely successful. Fidelity and Gartmore removed them earlier this year
after they found that few investors were cashing in their Peps early;
instead, they pushed up their initial charge to 3 per cent.
Since investors tend to hold on to unit trusts in Pep form for longer than
their other unit trusts, investment houses may use their new-found freedom
to levy exit charges on short-term, rather than on long-term holdings, such
as on emerging-markets trusts.
Cancellation price: From November 1, unit trusts will no longer have to show
the 'cancellation price' - the lowest price at which units can be bought
back by the unit trust company - in the national press.
The move is seen as the prelude to 'single pricing', whereby unit trusts
will quote one mid-market price instead of the present 'bid' and 'offer'
prices - the prices at which investors sell and buy their units.
The idea behind this is to simplify, and make more user-friendly, the
terminology, in an attempt to have wider public appeal.
Wider choice of markets: Fund managers are being given more freedom with the
relaxation of some investment restrictions. Authorised unit trusts have had
to keep 90 per cent of their money in markets that are on an 'approved' list
kept by the Securities and Investment Board (SIB), the City's chief
financial services regulator. Only 10 per cent could go into unapproved
markets, which tend to be in the fast-growing markets of south east Asia and
South America.
From November 1, the responsibility for deciding which markets are suitable
for inclusion in the 90 per cent safe rule will shift from SIB to the fund
manager. Ultra-cautious investors should, therefore, watch to see which
countries the fund manager decides to put on his or her 'eligible' list.
One change that has already taken place, and which has important
implications for those seeking income, is the permission given by SIB in May
to unit-trust companies to take their management fees out of income rather
than capital growth. This allows income funds to post a higher yield
overnight, without any change to their investment strategy.
Although the management companies are obliged to explain their
capital-charging strategy in their promotional literature, and will need to
point out that capital may be eroded, investors looking down a page of
yields will not know which companies have opted for this practice.
In any case, some income-seeking investors may prefer to go for total return
by taking income from capital growth and making use of their annual capital
gains tax allowance, currently Pounds 5,800, instead of paying income tax at
their marginal rate on the income received.
For most investors, the question of charges or the investment freedom of
fund managers will be less important than trust performance. And on page 27
of this review, John Cuthbert, who believes that most fund managers achieve
their returns through luck or relatively high risk, describes his method of
choosing a trust based on the investment skill of its manager.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): Second-feature
bargain became the big picture - Serious Riches / Scheherazade Daneshkhu
meets a film mogul who is also regarded as an investment guru

What does the classic film The African Queen, with Humphrey Bogart and
Katherine Hepburn, have in common with Oliver] the musical? Or Room at the
Top, a piece of 1950s social realism, with the thrillers The Day of the
Jackal and The Odessa File?
Apart from being highly successful and award-winning, they were all produced
by Sir John Woolf, the low-profile chairman of British &amp; American Film
Holdings plc, through his privately-owned production company, Romulus Films.
Last year, the National Film Theatre paid an evening of tribute to Sir John
followed by a week's season of his productions.
A career in films was natural for Sir John, given that his father, Charles
M. Woolf, was one of the pioneers of the British film industry. He headed
Gaumont-British Picture Corporation and was responsible for introducing Lord
Rank to the film industry. Sir John, who rejoined the company after war
service, returned to what had by then become The Rank Organisation but left
to set up Romulus Films in 1948 together with a distribution company to
finance and distribute other producers' films. His first big success was
with The African Queen, made in 1951 followed by Moulin Rouge in 1952, both
directed by John Houston.
'It was at the time of the UnAmerican Activities committee, and I realised
that there were a number of important American film directors who wouldn't
be able to continue to make films in America. We heard that John Houston was
having a bit of difficulty raising money in America for the African Queen,
for which he and Sam Spiegel were hoping to sign Bogart and Hepburn, so we
stepped in and organised the production in England.' His distribution
company also financed 50 per cent of four films produced by Sir Alexander
Korda, including Laurence Olivier's Richard III.
Sir John has not confined himself to the big screen but was also one of the
founders of Anglia Television, for which he established the company's drama
department. He was responsible for the highly-successful Tales of the
Unexpected series, which started as an adaptation of the novelist Roald
Dahl's short stories and which was sold to over 70 countries around the
world.
Apart from being acknowledged as a distinguished producer, Sir John is also
regarded as an investment guru. Four years ago, the monthly investment
magazine, Analyst, profiled him as a 'stock market legend'.
He does not claim to be an investment expert. However, his 'exceptional
business flair,' according to one former employee, has certainly played its
part in the fortunes of BAFH.
British &amp; American Film Press, as it was called when Sir John purchased it
as a shell company with assets of Pounds 500,000 in 1968, has not been
involved in film-making for the past 20 years. He bought it to house the
profits from his successful productions and he has run it as an investment
holding company ever since.
The success of his investment philosophy has meant that revenues from film
productions now account for a proportionately smaller contribution to the
profits, as the size and income generated by the investment portfolio has
grown. The last set of accounts shows that, at the end of 1993, net assets
were Pounds 34m and pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.2m.
Romulus Films, along with another family-owned production company, Remus
Films, and Sir John's personal holdings, have a controlling interest in
BAFH. Two years ago Sir John was joined at BAFH by his son Jonathan, who had
been a divisional director of corporate finance at SG Warburg.
'I thought at the time that I didn't know enough about investment, and
decided that investment trusts which then stood at quite a considerable
discount and had the knowledge through experience of the trust managers
would be a good idea,' he explained. 'So I invested the profit from the
films, which was then quite considerable, in investment trusts and the big
insurance companies.'
Investment trusts' performance has been aided by the narrowing of the
discount in recent years. Investment trusts, which are listed on the stock
exchange, invest in the shares of other companies, but their share price
fluctuates according to market demand. When demand is low, they have tended
to trade at a discount to their net asset value.
'I went for trusts which had at least a 20 per cent discount and about 25
per cent in US shares,' said Sir John. 'The trusts also had to have a yield
of at least 5 per cent, and more usually of 7 or 8 per cent. They have
proved to be excellent investments over the years.'
He acknowledges that it would be harder to begin a portfolio with the same
philosophy today. The creation of split-capital trusts, which separate
classes of share according to income and capital growth, and an increase in
regular savings schemes, have increased demand and contributed to a
narrowing of the discount. The average discount fell to a 20-year low of
around 4 per cent in January, but in the late 1960s it stood at between
25-30 per cent.
'We continually add to the original holdings. We are interested in high
yields, so we have also invested in the income shares of split-capital
trusts and other high yield trusts. We can't look at the discount as a major
factor any more, but instead consider the track record of the fund managers.
'
The portfolio has also been helped by a sevenfold rise in its investment in
First Leisure, which was formed in 1982. 'I heard that Lord Delfont was
buying out the leisure interests of Trusthouse Forte, and went in with him
through BAFH as one of the founders of First Leisure. That has been a huge
success,' said Sir John. BAFH took a 2.7 per cent holding and Anglia
Television took 5.4 per cent in First Leisure, which came to the market in
1984.
BAFH's investment portfolio holds 55 per cent in investment trusts; one
quarter is invested in First Leisure, with the rest in financial and life
assurance companies, such as the Prudential. There is also a small holding
in Rothschild companies and trusts. The portfolio is characterised by low
turnover.

new?

Regulatory changes due at the end of the year have begun casting shadows
ahead. Scottish Amicable acknowledges designing its new distribution bond
with a very conscious eye to the disclosure of commission and charges
required after January 1, 1995.
The distribution bond, a single-premium insurance bond taking a minimum of
Pounds 5,000, is linked to a fund investing in a mix of UK equities,
fixed-interest securities and property. Scottish Amicable says the target
for the 'distributions' or dividend payments which give the bond its name is
5 per cent after basic rate tax, to be met out of income only, unless a
holder requests a higher pay-out recognising that part of the capital will
be eroded to produce it.
Unlike other distribution bonds currently marketed, Scottish Amicable's
version will have a nil bid/offer spread - no upfront charge. The annual
fund management charge will be 1.5 per cent for the first five years, then
0.75 per cent a year. Investors who cash in a significant porportion or the
full amount of the bond within the first five years will have to pay an exit
charge, starting at 7 1/2 per cent in year one but dropping by 1.5
percentage points a year. However, this penalty will not apply to
withdrawals of up to 7 per cent of the value each year.
HSBC Unit Management, replacing James Capel as a brand-name, has just
launched Elector plan, seeing this as a rival to traditional distribution
bonds. The minimum investment is Pounds 5,000, with a pay-out level selected
each year to be delivered on a monthly basis. Elector uses HSBC's newly
launched Balanced Fund, a unit trust investing 55 per cent in UK equities,
30 per cent in fixed-interest securities and 15 per cent in convertibles.
Charges on the Balanced Fund are an initial 5.25 per cent and an annual 1.5
per cent taken out of capital.
The yield is expected to be 5 per cent - or 6.25 per cent if held through a
Pep.
Framlington Unit Management has launched a low-cost, unit-trust pension
plan, with charges designed to secure the group a ranking among the top 10
per cent of most competitive pension products. Minimum contributions are
either Pounds 50 monthly or Pounds 2,000 initially, with no limit on further
payments. The money is to be invested in Framlington's Exempt Balanced Fund,
and the charges are a plan fee of Pounds 100 in year one followed by Pounds
50 in each subsequent year. There is an initial charge of 5 per cent of each
contribution, reduced to 3 per cent if the investment is Pounds 2,000 or
more, and the annual management fee is 0.4 per cent, taken from income.
November will see three more investment trust launches, from Fleming, Legal
&amp; General and Murray Johnstone.
Fleming's Natural Resources investment trust is expected to require a
minimum investment of Pounds 2,500, and will carry an annual management
charge of 0.6 per
cent plus a performance-related fee. The portfolio will consist roughly of
30 per cent oil and gas shares, 30 per cent in base metals, 30 per cent gold
and precious metals and 10 per cent other raw materials. The fund managers
will be Ian Henderson and Mark Lawson-Statham, who run commodity, energy and
gold unit trusts for Fleming's Save &amp; Prosper subsidiary.
Legal &amp; General's Recovery investment trust has yet to fix details such as
minimum investment and annual charge, but the insurer says the aim is for
the new trust to qualify for Peps from the start, introducing a savings plan
at a later stage.
With a life of not more than 10 years, the L&amp;G recovery trust will have
about three-quarters of its portfolio in non-FT-SE shares, but will not hold
any unquoted companies. The fund manager is to be Ms Lesley Hooper,
currently running L&amp;G's Pounds 89m UK Recovery unit trust, which ranked 4th
out of 116 unit trusts in the UK equity growth sector over the last five
years, according to Micropal, showing a gain of 85 per cent.
Murray Johnstone's Emerging Economies investment trust will require a
minimum investment of Pounds 500 and carry an annual management fee of 1.25
per cent - with 25 per cent of this taken from revenue and 75 per cent from
capital. Murray Emerging Economies trust is to be managed by Glasgow-based
Rodger Scullion, who already runs Murray Smaller Markets, top of its sector
over the past one, 5 and 10 years, according to statistics from the
Association of Investment Trust Companies.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): New issues
abound, but tread carefully - Investment Trusts / From UK breweries to Asian
small companies . . . Bethan Hutton on the latest opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Summer is a quiet season for investment trusts, but come September, the
new-issues machine was once again cranking out a varied stream of new
products.
Areas as diverse as British regional brewers and international commodities
are to have their own specialist trusts.
Lazard Investors is bringing out a regional brewers trust, which will also
invest in pub companies and other drink manufacturers and retailers.
Two management groups have spotted a gap in the market for investment trusts
giving small investors access to international commodity markets. Fleming is
to run a natural resources investment trust, which will get exposure to
commodities by buying shares in companies involved in extracting and
processing natural resources. BZW has created a Jersey-registered investment
company (listed in London so it will behave like an investment trust) which
will use derivatives to try to beat a commodities index.
The trend is continuing for investment management groups that have
traditionally concentrated on unit trusts to move into investment trusts.
Earlier in the summer, Schroders launched a Japanese investment trust to
complement its range of Japanese unit trusts.
Now Fidelity, the large unit trust group, is adding a third investment trust
to its portfolio. The Fidelity Special Values trust will be a special
situations trust, to be managed by one of the UK's best-known fund managers,
European specialist Anthony Bolton. Fidelity's first investment trust was
European Values, also managed by Bolton, followed earlier this year by
Japanese Values.
Prolific, the fund management subsidiary of Scottish Provident, is dipping
its toe into investment-trust waters for the first time with a fairly safe
offering: an investment trust version of its dependable UK equity income
unit trust.
An unusual recent launch was the Emerging Markets Country trust, which was
created mainly by the conversion of units in the City of London Emerging
Markets unit trust into shares in the new investment trust. This gave the
fund assets of about Pounds 27m; and it immediately raised an extra Pounds
10.5m through a C-share issue. The unit and investment trust share an
investment strategy of putting money into emerging markets via other
closed-end trusts, rather than buying shares in companies.
Other newcomers include an emerging markets trust from Murray Johnstone (see
below), an Indian fund from Lazard, and a smaller Asian companies trust from
Hambros.
Nigel Sidebottom, investment trust specialist at Gerrard Vivian Gray, says
that the most exciting area for new issues over the summer was eastern
Europe - new funds have been launched to invest in Russia, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia and so on. However, most of these have been offshore
closed-end funds, not accessible to private investors at launch because they
carried minimum investments of Dollars 50,000 or more.
Small investors can pick up more manageable amounts in the aftermarket, but
Sidebottom warns: 'Russia is a very, very risky area - it really is pretty
hairy stuff - but there are tremendous opportunities out there as well.'
The lesson to be drawn from the fate of trusts launched in the past 12
months is to be choosy about which new issues you invest in. You should not
invest unless you are convinced that the trust is a sound bet for the long
term.
The two giant European privatisation issues of the first quarter, from
Kleinwort Benson and Mercury, are still languishing at below issue price,
even after warrants are taken into account. The Mercury trust is doing
slightly better than Kleinwort's offering, both in share price and asset
value terms, but it is still a disappointment given the great enthusiasm
surrounding its launch.
Anyone who had invested Pounds 1,000 in the Mercury fund would, by the end
of September, have had shares worth Pounds 820 and warrants worth Pounds 61;
the comparative figures for Kleinwort's trust are Pounds 780 and Pounds 59.
On the other hand, investors in 3i, the huge venture capital trust which
came to market in the summer, should be feeling pretty smug: its shares had
risen about 20 per cent by the end of September.
The average investment trust discount briefly reached a two-decade low of
about 4 per cent in January this year, but then widened as the markets
suffered in the aftermath of the first US rate rise. During the summer the
discount narrowed again, to about 5.5 per cent; it has since slipped, but
discounts are still narrow in historical terms.
As always, the average figure masks wide variations. The hefty premiums on
some high-income investment trusts - notable examples are Lazard High Income
and BZW Convertible, which have reached premiums as high as 20 per cent -
show that, despite the recent interest rate rise, there are still plenty of
investors looking for a better return than they can get from building
society deposits.
But anyone thinking of buying income investment trusts at a premium should
bear in mind that if interest rates rise any further, demand for the trust's
shares could fall sharply, changing the premium into a discount, and wiping
out a chunk of your capital.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Divided over
UK equities - The Professionals / Our four managers still disagree about
market prospects, and one has opted strongly for gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A substantial switch from equities into bonds by Gartmore Investment
Managment is the most striking move by our four professional fund managers,
at the end of a turbulent nine months on financial markets.
Paul Myners, of Gartmore, is moving from a portfolio split 90/10 in favour
of equities versus bonds to one with a 70/30 mix. He cites stretched equity
valuations and pessimism about corporate profits as the reasons.
Douglas McDougall, of Baillie Gifford, is also cautious about the outlook
for equities and is moving to a 30 per cent weighting in bonds and cash.
Howard Beaufort, of Newton Investment Managment, has only a 16 per cent
weight in bonds and cash and is rather more upbeat about equities. He thinks
equity markets 'will now consolidate and pave the way for higher levels at
the year end.'
In contrast to the other three, Tim Howe, of Singer &amp; Friedlander, owns no
conventional bonds at all - only some index-linked gilts. 'We have retained
our major exposure to the UK equity market, because it increasingly
represents fundamental value as earnings and dividends increase,' he says.
Howard Beaufort: 'A sharp rise in bond yields, following the unwinding of
speculative trading positions, has depressed investor confidence. Falling
leaves, it seems, are too often accompanied in investors' minds by fears of
falling financial markets.
'The economic background favours a reversal in investor sentiment, but,
given the cautious mood, this probably requires a further accumulation of
evidence that economic recovery and renewed growth will not lead
automatically to higher levels of inflation.
'To the ordinary investor, the financial planet must often seem an
upside-down world. While the economic recovery is cause for some rejoicing
by the populace in the streets: in the financial alleyways, it is seen only
as a cause for unmitigated wailing and gnashing of teeth.
'For our part, we continue to believe that this year's declines in financial
markets are an inevitable correction following the substantial rises of the
past three years, and that the peak in both short-term interest rates and
inflation will prove lower than in previous economic cycles.' Beaufort is
happy to buy soundly-based bond markets and quality equities.
Douglas McDougall: 'Three months ago, we expressed continued caution about
the outlook for equities, and maintained our relatively high cash balance of
15 per cent.
'The most striking feature of financial markets this year has been the
weakness of bonds and the high levels of real long-term interest rates. The
original cause of the rise in yields was probably the need for a change to a
tighter monetary policy in the US, and contributing factors have been the
strength of the global economy, the high levels of government borrowing and
the speculative positions built up in the bond market boom in 1993.
'Inflation is likely to push up soon but will probably fall short of the
levels reached in recent cycles, partly because of the discipline exercised
on governments by bond and currency markets.
'Bond yields are close to their highs, though they may be slow to fall.
Current yields offer strong competition for equities, which in most markets
are quite highly valued by historical standards and assume a more extended
period of profit growth than is likely to be achieved.
'We are making no change to our distribution. We shall continue with
relatively high holdings of bonds and cash, and give priority within the
equity portfolio to the UK.'
Paul Myners: 'We hinted last quarter that the nimble investor may be better
off in bonds at some point. Given the continued outperformance by equities,
it is now time to change our portfolio.'
Myners cites two main reasons for the switch. 'First, the relationships
between bonds and equities are now looking stretched. Second, investors are
probably overestimating the profit potential of companies in a
disinflationary environment. But in an environment where prices are not
rising, further increases in profits will be restricted.
'Central to this thesis is our view that inflation will not accelerate
unduly. It will clearly rise from the current low level, but the
disinflationary forces are at work.
'Our central case for equities is not bearish. We hope that the anomaly we
perceive between equities and bonds will be corrected by bonds recovering.
There is a risk, however, that this recovery is delayed, and this would
undoubtedly take its toll on equity prices, with setbacks of 15 per cent
being possible.
Myners is selling a 10 per cent weighting in UK equities and putting the
proceeds into long gilts. He is also moving 10 per cent into US dollar
bonds, raising funds by selling a 5 per cent holding in continental European
equities, 2.5 per cent in US smaller company stocks and 2.5 per cent in
Japanese equities. He is diversifying his 5 per cent holding in Mexico
across the whole of Latin America.
Tim Howe: 'The increasing inter-dependence of the world's financial markets
is amply demonstrated by the attention being given to US monetary policy.
The ongoing strength of the US economy is increasing pressure on the Fed to
raise interest rates again, thus undermining recovery prospects for US
bonds. Against this background, US equities look set to struggle as monetary
conditions harden. European equities look better value in the light of the
substantial scope for higher profits as recovery gathers pace.
'The depth of the Japanese recession will ensure that monetary policy
remains relaxed. The performance of the Japanese equity market has been
disappointing over the last quarter, but the bull case for substantial
appreciation remains.
'Public perception of the UK's economic performance will continue to
improve, but sentiment in financial markets is affected by fears prevailing
on Wall Street.
'Over three-quarters of our portfolio is invested in the UK, and this
represents a bet on a continuation of last quarter's sterling strength. The
major changes in investment policy have been overseas, where we have reduced
exposure to the US and Japan and increased our investment in the emerging
markets and commodity producers.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (14): Gilts offer
hope among Europe's high yielders - Bonds / Calling the end of the market's
current bear run is proving more difficult than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The negative sentiment which has overhung the international bond markets for
most of the year shows little sign of subsiding in the final quarter. In
fact, the inflationary pressures which have dogged the market throughout the
year are if anything intensifying as Europe's economies follow the US out of
recession.
In general, economists appear to have underestimated the strength of the
world economy, and it now seems likely that monetary policy will have to be
tightened more swiftly than expected in many countries. Already, short-term
rates have been hiked in the US, UK, Australia and Sweden, while long-term
rates have shot up around the world.
International bond yields have risen as a result of several factors,
including the growth in inflationary expectations in most markets, which may
itself be linked to the sharp rise in commodity prices this year. In
addition, real yields (yields after inflationary expectactions have been
discounted) also appear to have increased. The poor performance of
index-linked markets in the UK, Canada, Australia and Denmark points to a
clear rise in real yields.
This rise in real yields was sparked not only by the increase in US
short-term rates, which started in February, but also by concern about the
supply of government borrowing, especially in Europe. The markets had
managed to shrug off funding pressures in 1993, partly helped by large net
purchases by US-based investors, including hedge funds; but when sentiment
turned sour, supply became a crucial concern.
'At the start of this year, these purchases from the US went into reverse,'
according to analysts at Yamaichi International. 'Not only did yields have
to adjust to a level which would encourage European investors to hold a
larger portfolio of bonds, but they also had to take into account the
possibility that future net flows of bonds would not be purchased by
dollar-based investors either.'
Further, risk premia have risen in most major bond markets since the start
of the year as the general level of nervousness has caused investors to
demand a higher level of nominal yields. Currency instability and inceased
volatility in bond markets have contributed to a vicious circle of
uncertainty and market gyrations.
Calling the end of the market's current bear run is proving more difficult
than had been anticipated: one lesson which has had to be learnt this year
is that economic fundamentals are not the sole determining factor of market
performance. Nevertheless, some analysts still believe that negative
expectations have been overdone.
In particular, despite the pick-up in economic growth this year, relatively
wide output gaps remain in most economies, and these are likely to hold back
inflationary growth. This means that inflationary expectations may have been
exaggerated. Further, bond market volatility has already subsided from the
highs seen earlier in the year, and this could encourage risk premia to fall
in time.
According to Yamaichi, 'the problems that beset bond markets earlier this
year are only being solved slowly, and fund managers' scars will be slow to
heal. But the fundamentals are getting better (at least outside of the US)
and, if such things matter, that should now be tending to pull yields
lower.'
Perhaps the greatest hurdle to any potential recovery is the US Treasury
market, where further rate hikes are expected. So far this year, the US
market has been a pervasive influence on the rest of the world's bond
markets, many of which have actually underperformed the US.
'European markets have been bravely trying to decouple but, with the
honourable (and recent) exception of the gilts market, have singularly
failed to do so,' says Mr Mark Cliffe, chief international economist at
Midland Global Markets.
The gilts market, one of the weakest for most of this year, is now returning
to favour. Mr Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi, cites
subdued inflation and the government's well-advanced funding programmes as
reasons for a potential recovery in the market, despite the possibility of
further short-term rate hikes.
The German market is also expected to remain a relatively safe haven, with
some analysts still expecting the German authorities to cut rates further -
or at least not to start raising rates until well into next year.
The prospects for Europe's high-yielding markets remain shaky, with Italy in
particular unsettled not only by current political uncertainty but also by
the lack of confidence among international investors, many of whom have been
badly burnt this year.
Overall, the prospects for a healthy and prolonged recovery in bond prices
remain poor. According to NatWest Markets: 'The fear of last quarter - that
the global cyclical upswing is igniting inflationary pressures - has
intensified, as highlighted by the continuous weakness of bond markets. Yet
again economic growth is proving more robust than we thought, although, if
anything, inflation is proving a little more subdued.' Given that even the
most optimistic of commentators are hoping for only a modest recovery in
bond market performance, a cautious stance by investors is likely to
persist.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): A disappointed
man explains two upsets - 'Ahead of the index, but should have done better'
is the report at the end of year three
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON

<TEXT>
The decline in the value of the portfolio over the past quarter makes me
feel rather like a chastened hamster: I want to hide myself away in a pile
of wood-shavings.
I had hoped that, after three years, the portfolio would have doubled in
value. Instead, its performance has disappointed me, although it has still
comfortably 'beaten' the FT-SE Actuaries All-share index and shown better
results than just leaving UK currency on deposit with a bank or building
society.
I take comfort from having voiced pessimistic views all year and from an old
quotation by Edward Phelps: 'The man who makes no mistakes does not usually
make anything.'
Perhaps more appropriate is an even older comment from Edmund Burke: 'I am
convinced that we have a degree of delight, and that no small one, in the
real misfortunes and pains of others.'
Readers can therefore prepare to be 'delighted' as I explain how two recent
'disasters' damaged the portfolio.
In the summer article, written on June 30 but published on July 15 and 16, I
mentioned that the portfolio had 'bought' 6,000 shares in OIS International
for 55p each. A stop-loss figure (the price at which the shares would be
sold) was set at 40-42p.
No sooner did the Review appear than OIS announced (on July 18) a profits
warning, and the shares fell 18p in a day]
Why had I not foreseen such an event? OIS is a technical inspection services
group which only came to the market in 1992, via a placing at 50p per share.
Profits seemed to be on an upward trend.
Indeed, in a statement dated April 19, 1994, the chairman commented:
'Results have been encouraging'; and: 'I am confident that during the
current year we will continue to make good progress.'
Pre-tax profits for the year to December 31, 1993, were Pounds 2.2m. The
company's report revealed that Friends Provident, Edinburgh Fund Managers
and Perpetual Unit Trust Management were large shareholders in the company.
The financial figures looked respectable: gearing was only 4 per cent, and
the report mentioned improvements in profits in its Middle East activities,
with expansion plans for a number of other areas, including China, Thailand,
Indonesia and South America.
Yet what appeared rosy in April turned into comments of gloom in July, with
reports of reduced margins and the loss of a number of contracts.
The interim statement, dated September 16, revealed a pre-tax profit of only
Pounds 60,000, compared with Pounds 1.4m for the same period last year.
An even greater blow to the portfolio's recent performance was the plunge in
the share price of Alvis, in response to the company's September 23
statement mentioning that the group had been 'affected by volume shortfalls
caused by the cancellation or slippage of anticipated orders in both the
engineering and electro-optics businesses. In consequence of this, the
overall trading performance in the second half has been below the board's
expectations'.
Alvis had originally been included in the portfolio for its longer-term
potential, as Brierley Investments held a 29 per cent share stake and the
value of Alvis's shareholding in Avimo of Singapore was perhaps worth as
much as Alvis's own market capitalisation.
The portfolio had 'bought' 6,250 Alvis shares for 40p each in January and
seen them rise to 64p at the end of the last quarter.
If the portfolio had been much larger, with a wider spread of investments, I
might have decided to retain the Alvis shareholding in the hope of an upturn
in the company's fortunes and/or a takeover approach. However, I felt I had
to activate the stop-loss price of 40p in order to protect the immediate
value of the portfolio.
These two 'experiences' demonstrate the importance of stop-loss levels. The
portfolio managed to 'get out' of OIS at 42p and Alvis at 40p (the levels
set in the previous Review), thus avoiding their subsequent falls to 24p and
29p respectively.
As to the future of the portfolio, I remain concerned about the fickleness
of the market. Even some companies with assets worth considerably more than
their share price have fallen, whereas a number of companies which I think
have mediocre prospects have risen to what I believe are unsustainable
levels.
Governments around the world are struggling to borrow yet more money to
finance their spending plans, and they may be tempted to offer even higher
interest rates which could well have damaging effects on stock markets and
economic prospects.
Having suffered two 'disasters', I am not being tempted out of my pile of
wood shavings to invest in any more companies at present. Even the cash on
deposit may be switched into Swiss francs if I feel the pound might be under
some pressure. As to the portfolio's current holdings, stop-losses will be
set as follows: Allied Colloids (105-110p), William Ransom (38p), Pentland
(80p), Taylor Nelson AGB (28p).
The author of this feature, which first appeared in the autumn 1991 issue of
the Review, is familiar to many readers as the writer of the Diary of a
Private Investor column in the Weekend FT. The Review invited him to suggest
a Pounds 10,000 portfolio for capital growth, without being too speculative.
The views expressed are his own. He states that his personal pension fund
has a small holding in Alvis, OIS, William Ransom, Taylor Nelson AGB and
Pentland.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (12): Flat Nikkei
reflects declining confidence

<TEXT>
For many Japanese, including urban dwellers, autumn still means the harvest
and celebrations of the new rice crop. Festivals are held all over the
country, including one led by the emperor offering the new rice crop to the
deities.
But while this summer's hot weather has ensured a good harvest for the
country's farmers, there has not been much of a crop to reap for many
investors in the Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks remained
almost flat during July-September quarter, fluctuating around the 20,000
level.
It finished down 5.2 per cent on the quarter, but had risen 12.3 per cent
since the beginning of the year. Weak buying by overseas fund managers, who
had supported Japanese share prices earlier this year, and the lack of
confidence among domestic institutional investors led to lethargy on the
Tokyo stock market.
Meanwhile, worries about over-supply have plagued investors. Trading volume
has been subdued, due to concerns about the Y150bn flotation of Japan
Telecom in September and the Y900bn offering of Japan Tobacco shares this
month. The spate of equity-linked bond issues by leading Japanese companies
this quarter is also sucking up funds from the stock market.
Predications for the final quarter vary. Some analysts hope that the strong
export demand from the US and Asia will help corporate earnings, hence
supporting Japanese shares. Others claim that, with the rally at the
beginning of the year, Japanese shares have already discounted much of the
economic recovery.
In contrast, most analysts agree that robust economic growth is likely to
support the rest of the Pacific Rim region. South-east Asian countries have
benefited from a rise in exports, due to the sharp rise in the yen, and from
growing domestic demand. Mr Keith Ferguson, at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in
Hong Kong, is optimistic about South Korea and Taiwan, due to strong
liquidity and corporate earnings growth.
South Korea, which rose 12.9 per cent on the quarter, is expected to be
supported by domestic demand, with capital investment by manufacturers
remaining strong. Investors in Taiwan, which gained 20.2 per cent last
quarter, remain bullish, due to deregulation of the financial markets. The
central bank is backing the easing of foreign restrictions on bond and
equities purchases, while the government is ready to loosen restrictions on
margin lending.
Other south-east Asian markets performed well during the third quarter,
although most remain below the highs reached at the end of last year. Many
investors are optimistic about Indonesia, which rose 8.8 per cent on the
quarter. Analysts believe that the economy has bottomed and that corporate
earnings are ready for a rebound of 40 to 45 per cent. Monetary policy has
become smoother and more transparent, leading to more efficient monetary
operations.
One market which has captured the interest of investors is India. Brokers
see India as the next China, as the country experiences strong growth thanks
to its economic reforms and liberalisation. The Bombay Sensitive index which
closed the quarter at 4339.46, has risen by 4.4 times since the start of the
year. Some investors expect the index to rise to 5,000 by March next year,
and believe it could double in the next two or three years in the absence of
any political turmoil.
On the other hand, caution prevails over Hong Kong and China. Although the
Hang Seng index rose 8.7 per cent on the quarter, to 9521.24, worries over
the ability of China's economy to achieve a soft landing, due to high
inflation, are expected to weigh on stock prices.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Flying Finns
set the pace but Europe recalls '87
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental European equities put up a better performance in the third
quarter of 1994 than they did over the first six months.
However, September taken alone was grisly: at the end of the month, brokers
and investors were recalling edgily that it was in October that the crash of
1987 had occurred.
Last month saw drops of 5.9 per cent in the Europe ex-UK component of the
FT-Actuaries World indices, and 8.5 per cent in both the German and the
French equity markets. The best performance was put up by Italy with a fall
of 1.4 per cent.
The theory was that the more disciplined economies of Germany and France had
virtually come to the end of their down-swing in key interest rates. Italy,
said its fans, had room for improvement, as the right-wing government headed
by Mr Silvio Berlusconi moved towards the budget-deficit reduction package,
which it announced towards the end of the month.
The Nordic bloc performed well over the three-month period, with a 2.9 per
cent gain, although it fell 3.2 per cent in September alone. Within this, at
corporate level, there were one or two hints that may have helped investors.
Picking the right country was one: during the quarter, the top ten stocks in
the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index included three Finnish companies, two Swedes
and one Norwegian.
The Finns - Nokia, Kymmene and Outokompu - featured high in the charts for
the first nine months of 1994 - and also for the 12 months to end-September,
as well as in the third quarter - although they are a telecoms conglomerate,
a forestry group and a metals company respectively.
Forgetting their individual attractions, all three reflected Finland's
status as the best performer in the World Index series this year - up 14 per
cent over the past three months, and 22.2 per cent over nine. The local
currency gain in the latter stretched to 45.6 per cent in terms of this
year's depreciating dollar, and 36.5 per cent in terms of sterling. The
market began to flag only as corporate expansion brought out rights issues,
and the decline of the dollar bit into export profit margins.
However, choice by country carried its dangers. There were two French
companies among the top 10 performers - Carrefour, the hypermarket retailer;
and LVMH, the luxury goods group which takes in Moet Hennessy champagne,
wines and spirits, Louis Vuitton luggage and Dior perfumes. But there were
also three in the bottom 10: Alcatel Altsthom, Generale des Eaux, and
Danone.
Two of these pointed up the general rule: that it is not wise to get
involved in scandal or nasty corporate accidents. Alcatel, the engineering,
transport and telecommunications equipment group, compounded the
investigation of its chairman, Mr Pierre Suard, for alleged corruption with
the disclosure, on September 28, that profits had tumbled and were likely to
see a further decline in the second half of this year.
The Alcatel profits story cast a cloud over the European investment scene.
Analysts had been relying on cyclicals to provide excitement, rather than
apprehension this winter; but, since the company said that one of its big
problems was in the German telecommunications supply market, Siemens of
Germany went weak, too, along with Brown Boveri in Switzerland and Asea in
Sweden.
Generale des Eaux, meanwhile, was depressed by allegations of irregularities
in matters allied to political party funding.
There were other hazards. Novo Nordisk, the drugs and biotechnology group
and third worst performer in the third quarter after Alcatel and Eaux,
reported profits below market expectations in mid-August. One reason was
unrealised bond losses, a scourge of the unwary investor, corporate or
otherwise, in 1994.
The threatened rise in European interest rates finally turned defensive
characteristics into a liability. Endesa and Iberdrola, the Spanish
electrical utilities, lost ground on their interest-rate sensitivity in a
Madrid market which was, for a time, very sick on that score.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (11): US investors
fear aggressive Fed will curtail profits growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
In spite of yet more talk of rising inflation, higher global interest rates
and a gloomy outlook for financial asset prices worldwide, the US stock
market put in a surprisingly solid performance during the third quarter.
Buoyed for most of the period by expectations of stable interest rates, and
supported by more good news on company profits and a string of big corporate
mergers in key industries, all the leading stock indices posted gains over
the three months.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 218 points, or 6 per cent, to finish
the quarter at 3,843.19. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, a broader measure of
market performance, rose 4.1 per cent to 462.69, while the Nasdaq composite
index - which includes many of the country's biggest technology companies -
jumped 8.3 per cent to 764.29. These gains represented an impressive
recovery from the losses of the first two quarters, when rising US interest
rates threw stock and bond markets completely out of kilter.
July opened with investors fearful that the weakness of the dollar would
force the Federal Reserve to put up interest rates to support the US
currency. The Fed, however, initially held its fire, and with the second
quarter reporting season showing further improvement in corporate earnings,
share prices began a steady, if unspectacular, climb from 3,650 to 3,800
during July and early August.
By mid-August, however, the strength of the economy meant that central
bankers could not ignore the bond market's deepening concern about
inflation. On August 16, the Fed tightened monetary policy for the fifth
time in 1994. The 50 basis-point increase in the discount rate to 4 per cent
and the Fed funds rate to 4.75 per cent was well received in the market,
primarily because investors and analysts hoped it would be the last upward
move in rates for several months, if not for the year.
This expectation that rates would remain stable for the foreseeable future
sustained prices throughout late August and early September, with the Dow
rising to a high for the quarter of 3,953.88 on September 15. Stocks were
also aided by a string of high-profile corporate deals in the healthcare,
defence and telecommunications industries. The deals included American Home
Products' takeover of American Cyanamid, and Martin Marrietta's merger with
Lockheed. Rumours of other billion-dollar transactions - most notably
involving television broadcast networks - also kept merger mania alive.
By the last few weeks of the quarter, however, unexpectedly strong economic
and inflation data had undermined hopes for stable interest rates, and the
spectre of another Fed tightening hung over the market. By the start of the
final quarter, the Dow was more than 100 points off its peak of
mid-September, bond yields were at their highest levels since 1992, and
analysts were predicting another interest rate increase within four to six
weeks.
The only bright spot was a forecast of another impressive quarterly
reporting season; but with concern growing that the Fed's aggressive
tightening of monetary policy would eventually lead to not just slower
economic growth, but lower corporate earnings as well, investors feared that
they could not count on strong profits growth for very long.
In Canada, share prices also staged a solid rebound from summer lows,
although the gains on the Toronto Stock Exchange during the quarter were not
quite as great as on Wall Street. During the quarter, the TSE-300 composite
climbed 178.7, or 4.3 per cent, to 4,357.67, with investors shrugging off
the implications of the election in mid-September of a separatist government
in Quebec.
Mexican markets also had key elections to contend with, but the expected
victory in the presidential race of the ruling PRI party's candidate had
little impact upon share prices, which rose steadily throughout the period.
In the last week of September, however, prices dipped sharply following the
assassination of the PRI's secretary general, which forced investors to
focus again on the issue of internal political reforms. The IPC index ended
with a gain of 22 per cent, at 2,746.11.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): Profit-hunters
stalk the Celtic tiger - Ireland has returned 17 per cent over the past
year, as overseas investors take a growing stake in the Dublin market. And
this was before any possible peace dividend in the north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Against a poor performance in Europe in the third quarter, the Irish market
 -the second oldest in the world after London - turned in an impressive
total return of more than 10 per cent for sterling-based investors. The
quarter also saw the Provisional IRA's ceasefire in Northern Ireland,
raising the tantalising question as to whether there could be a peace
dividend for investors in Ireland.
The Dublin stock exchange - still part of the London market until next
April, when there will be a legal decoupling - has turned in a more than 5
per cent gain in sterling terms this year, against a decline in London of
almost 11 per cent. Over a full year to end-September, Ireland has advanced
by 17 per cent, while London just about stood still.
Many non-Irish investors have caught the bandwagon. Overseas investors are
now estimated to hold some 40 per cent of the Dublin market, against only 10
per cent four years ago. Over the same period, some Irish funds have
inevitably lost out as they have reduced their domestic exposure following
the lifting of Irish exchange control.
The Irish switch to overseas markets initially brought about a sharp decline
in Dublin, but in the 15 months beginning October 1992 the market there rose
by more than 90 per cent, albeit aided by a currency devaluation following
the British exit from the ERM - of which Ireland remains a member. In the
current calendar year, Ireland joins Italy and three of the four
Scandinavian countries as the only gainers for sterling-based investors in
the FT-Actuaries European Index.
This outperformance, combined with encouraging projections for the Irish
economy, has prompted Morgan Stanley to focus on what the US investment bank
calls the 'Celtic tiger'. Dublin-based brokers report a steady flow of
American (and German) funds into their market, although its capacity to
absorb major flows is clearly limited.
There are just over 60 shares listed on the Irish market, where daily
turnover averages Pounds 25m. But the big players dominate, with roughly
half of the market's capitalisation represented by four companies - the two
big Irish banks (Allied Irish and Bank of Ireland); the global
paper/packaging operator, Smurfit; and Cement Roadstone Holdings. All four
also have listings in London, as do a number of other major Irish companies.
The Dublin market, which operates on a matched bargain basis, rather than
the market-making system in London, does have liquidity problems, especially
for shares in smaller companies. It operates currently within the same
regulatory environment as London, but there has been the occasional scam in
the smaller-company sector. The market will have an interesting new player
next week when the country's largest domestic mortgage provider, the Irish
Permanent, follows the Abbey National's demutualisation route and gets a
listing in both London and Dublin. Meanwhile, the National Westminster Bank
is trying to buy the state-owned TSB Bank and merge it with its Ulster Bank
subsidiary.
Competition for the TSB is coming from the National Australia Bank, which
already controls the small but aggressive National Irish Bank. Neither
bidder has missed the fact that, in the hitherto cosy world of Irish
banking, the return on equity is believed to be close to double the
mainstream European average.
Dublin stockbroker Goodbody now sees Ireland as a serious buy, pointing to
the 'excellent' long-term growth outlook for the Irish economy. Growth to
the end of the decade is put at an annual average of 5 per cent. On the
fiscal front, government borrowing is expected to average less than 1 per
cent of GDP over the next six years; while the debt-to-GDP ratio, says
Goodbody, is expected to fall to 58 per cent, or almost half the level as
recently as 1987. Corporate earnings are forecast to rise 15-20 per cent
annually.
All this is before any peace dividend that might arise from a permanent
ceasefire in the north.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): London waits on
gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final quarter of the year promises to be a testing time for the UK stock
market and for the nerves of its profesional participants.
At the end of the third quarter, the FT-SE 100 index was still 20 per cent
short of the City consensus forecast for the year-end. Yet the market was
faltering, having stumbled around the 3,000 mark for some weeks as worries
over global interest rates unsettled bond markets.
Confidence was not helped by slackening trading volumes in the stock market,
accompanied by hints that further redundancies in the securities industry
might not be far away.
The London market could only hold on to a 3.7 per cent gain over the three
months, having been nearly 12 per cent ahead in the middle of the period.
FT-SE All-Share index stocks gave a total return of 4.4 per cent,
outperforming most of their global rivals, at least in sterling terms.
London also leaned heavily on strong performances from a handful of
big-capitalisation, blue-chip stocks. The top 100 stocks, admittedly those
most likely to attract fund managers, gave a return of 5 per cent, while
returns from the Mid 250 and SmallCap stocks were only 3.2 per cent and 2.7
per cent respectively.
Within the Footsie list, utilities stood out, water stocks returning 14.6
per cent, electricity issues 14 per cent and gas distribution 10.9 per cent.
Strictly local factors, notably favourable reviews from their regulatory
bodies, made the running for utilities. In particular, dividend policies,
both actual and potential, drove the shares ahead and also brought in the
institutional buyers who were becoming fearful for their income flows as
global bond markets trembled.
Increasing dividend and earnings flows across UK companies provided the
impetus for a stock market where the falling interest rates could no longer
be counted on to turn up trumps for equity investors. Indeed, the half point
rise in domestic base rates in mid-September surprised only by its timing,
and City bets are for a further rise before Christmas.
The prospect of higher interest rates across Europe and the US has thrown
yet greater emphasis on market hopes that recovery in the UK economy, in the
form of rising corporate earnings and dividends, will secure a further
advance in the market, taking it at least into the middle of 1995.
Unfortunately, by the end of the third quarter, faith in the corporate
earnings flow had come into question. Some consumer companies admitted to
stiff pricing competition and tighter margins, and business surveys
continued to cast doubt on the progress of consumer spending.
Strongly phrased profits warnings from the merchant banking sector increased
the market's worries.
Entering the final quarter, there are signs that some analysts' nerves are
beginning to fray. Forecasts of a Footsie year-end figure of 3,400-3,600 at
the top end of the range of predictions are put forward less vigorously than
a few months ago.
The City of London is no longer a happy place.
The moment of decison is likely to occur in the bond markets when British
government securities show their response to the hike in Federal Reserve
rates now seen as almost inevitable. A stable bond market could still turn
the trick for equities and release the pent-up investment demand which is
ready to celebrate economic recovery.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Savers'
sentinel will need time to prove it's up to the task - Investor Protection /
The new watchdog authority, which has been the subject of controversy, has
begun operations. What difference will it make?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The creation of a single financial services regulator to protect the private
investor has taken a long time. And it will be some years before it becomes
apparent whether the Personal Investment Authority, which opened for
business in July, is effectively protecting financial services customers
from fraud and incompetent advice.
The PIA's purpose, as set out by the chief City regulator, is to bring about
a 'step change' in investor protection. It was intended that it should do
this in two broad ways:
First, in place of the split system, where Lautro and Fimbra were separate
regulators responsible for life companies and independent financial advisers
respectively, it would bring consistent standards of regulation, whatever
the consumers' source of advice.
Second, by scrutinising life companies and independent advisers who apply to
be authorised, and by introducing new standards of regulation, it would
allow the retail financial services industry to make a fresh start, and
would give added impetus to regulatory improvements.
In terms of the first point, there has already been a change in the climate
of opinion in and around the industry. Once, the idea of a single regulator
for retail financial services was a matter of controversy; now, it is
received wisdom. The concept of a single watchdog was virtually the only
issue on which the cross-party treasury committee of MPs was fully agreed,
in the report they produced in May on financial regulation.
The second point is more complex. One argument is that the number of
applicants that the PIA turns down, and the reasons why it does so, will be
a sign of how rigorously it is using the opportunity to weed out of the
industry those who ought not to be in it.
There is also the view that the gap between the number of applications and
the potential membership of about 5,500 is a sign that some of those
operating in retail financial services realised in advance that they would
not meet the PIA's standards, and decided to jump before they were pushed.
Beyond the application process itself is the new regime that PIA will run.
Some of the signs are promising, though they are not without cost.
Among the welcome prospects are:
The involvement of a consumers' panel, which will produce a report each year
on the effectiveness of the PIA.
An approach to monitoring companies and advisers which is explicitly based
on the 'risks' run by each member - for example, in its type of business.
An ombudsman scheme which has the capacity to deal with all complaints
relating to financial services business.
Less welcome, for example, was the PIA's reluctance - until under pressure
from the treasury committee - to be prepared to adopt a system of individual
registration for all those it authorises. This was a requirement for Fimbra,
but not for Lautro.
Then there has been the cost of the disruption to continuing regulatory
efforts, while attention was diverted to the setting up of the new watchdog
itself. There has been some disturbance to the existing programme of routine
visits; and work in policy areas, such as monitoring the rates at which
long-term policies were surrendered early, has also been affected.
But the fierce controversy over the form of the new regulator has also had a
wider impact.
On one level, it is a good sign that the new watchdog has not received
unanimous approval from the sector it is supposed to scrutinise. The
closeness of the relationship between Fimbra and its constituency led some
observers to conclude that the watchdog was too inclined to wag its tail
when it should have been baring its teeth.
However, the continuing dispute has undermined the PIA in two ways.
It has, for example, caused attention to focus on issues which are not
directly germane to investor protection. The insistence by Ms Colette Bowe,
PIA chief executive, that the question should be 'not whether it is
statutory or self - but whether it is effective regulation', suffered early
this year from the high-profile resignation from the PIA board of Jim
Stretton, deputy managing director of Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual
life insurer, over the board's composition.
He said that the new system could not amount to self-regulation, as it is
supposed to under the Financial Services Act 1986, when more than half the
PIA board would not come from the financial services industry.
Second - although Prudential Corporation remains a lone rebel - it is not
good for the regulator that the UK's largest life insurer has insisted on
its right to be regulated directly by the Securities and Investments Board,
the City's chief watchdog.
Some of these difficulties have arisen because the government has wanted to
shift the regulatory arrangements deriving from the 1986 Act without passing
new legislation.
Though the Treasury is not currently prepared to legislate to create a
full-blown statutory system of regulation, this does not mean the PIA is
necessarily the end of the regulatory road. The arrival of either a Labour
administration, or a fresh cause for concern, or both, could bring pressure
for change within the next few years.
So the PIA will need to build on the progress it is already making, and show
a rapid improvement in standards, in order to be sure of survival. In the
meantime, within existing constraints, it is the most effective retail
regulator we have.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): The long-term
fix doesn't suit everyone - Mortgages / Reports from the home-loans front
vary. Barbara Ellis checks what the lenders are up to
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two leading market indicators reached a point of almost total contradiction
early in September, when the Nationwide building society reported a 0.6 per
cent rise in house prices, while the Halifax declared a 0.7 per cent fall.
Forecasts tailed off from the Halifax's April prediction of a 5 per cent
rise for the year to a revised 2 per cent maximum. Somehow the idea of
wiping out inflation has never held much appeal for housing-market analysts
employed by lenders, who persist in viewing all house-price inflation as
good news.
Reports of mortgage-lending activity were as diverse as assessments of price
trends.
Patrick Bunton, of the Chase de Vere subsidiary London &amp; Country Mortgages,
said the mood among lenders had changed significantly in the 12 months to
September - from extreme caution to renewed willingness to lend, with local
managers making greater use of discretion.
'Lending is the message from the head offices,' he said. 'Default on
existing mortgage books has peaked, and there are not so many people with
negative equity: it did not hit fairly high-worth clients too hard.'
However, Bunton said lending criteria were still very tight for those
borrowers who wanted to escape negative equity (an outstanding home loan in
excess of the price the property will fetch). Despite the existence of
packages providing loans of 100 per cent or more, he suggested people in a
negative-equity position should approach their existing lender first.
'Existing lenders can be more lenient if they know the track record,' he
explained, 'Most lenders will try to help their own borrowers, but they are
not keen to run out and lend to everybody else's clients.'
The half-point rise in base rates in mid-September was likely to increase
demand for fixed-interest mortgages just as they began to disappear,
according to Bunton, who said his firm had been arranging a large number of
loans on two- and three-year fixed rates for months past.
'It's a big psychological thing,' he said. 'People like the idea of fixing,
but don't want to pay a premium over the lender's standard variable rate.'
An example was that, shortly before the base-rate rise, borrowers had
preferred to take two- and three-year fixed-rate loans at 6.99 per cent,
when the standard variable rate was at 7.75 per cent, rather than pay 8.35
per cent for a five-year fixed rate. At the same time, the TSB had been
offering a 10-year fixed rate of 8.99 per cent.
Still, Bunton recognised the hazards attached to long-term fixes. 'Even if
the loan is portable, the danger is you are locked in with the lender for
any additional borrowing when you want to move. If they are not competitive
at that point, you might have to renegotiate and pay redemption penalties.'
Ian Darby, of mortgage brokers John Charcol, said his firm had seen business
levels in the three months to mid-September up by between 50 and 80 per
cent, with clients asking almost exclusively for fixed rates for terms of
three years or less.
The Britannia building society had been market leader in fixed rates, with
6.99 per cent fixed for three years to October 1997, and a five-year rate of
8.15 per cent fixed until September 1999.
'To my mind, 8.15 per cent looked like a real buy,' said Darby. 'You are
within 10 basis points of Abbey National's base rate, and the consensus in
the market is that rates have only one way to go: up.
Even so, after five years of being very bearish on house prices, Darby said
Charcol now expected a healthier outlook in the next 18 months: 'House
affordability is excellent and the economy is in reasonably good nick,' he
said, as reasons for the firm's change to optimism.
Cash-back deals have been promoted strongly as a means of enticing borrowers
into signing up for the variable-rate mortgages which bring lenders the
fattest profit margins. But Darby said he had arranged very few loans of
that kind: 'The best cash-backs gave you 3 per cent back, yet you could get
a 5 per cent discount.'
At one point during the summer, the Halifax building society stopped
offering discounts, making cash-backs the only form of inducement. But it
reintroduced the discounts at the end of July after seeing a noticeable drop
in business.
A Halifax spokesman blamed speculation about the tax treatment of
cash-backs, following an Inland Revenue ruling that a cash-back deal offered
by the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society would be liable to capital
gains tax, though not income tax, as a 'capital sum derived from a
contractual right'. Borrowers taking the C&amp;G cash were said to be accepting
the money in exchange for the right to a discount.
'There was enough uncertainty to put people off the pure cash-back,' said
the Halifax spokesman, claiming research had shown the society that
borrowers preferred cash in hand at the start of a loan to help fund
solicitors' fees and other items, rather than the drip-feed effect of a
discount spread over maybe two or three years.
However, the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester said that, despite the Revenue opinion,
its cash-back scheme had been successful enough to be made part of the
society's permanent product range instead of a short-term promotion as
originally intended.
At the same time as launching its cash-backs in May, the C&amp;G pulled out of
fixed-rate lending, saying rates had become too difficult to manage:
'Customers seem to have gone off fixed rates a bit anyway,' said a C&amp;G
spokeswoman.
The C&amp;G's cash-back deal offered borrowers putting down a 20 per cent
deposit a maximum of Pounds 6,000 cash when signing up to borrow at the
society's 7.64 per cent variable rate. Alternatively, borrowers could choose
a 12-month discount of 3 percentage points, bringing their rate down to 4.64
per cent.
The Northern Rock building society also said borrowers had been keen to take
its much smaller cash-back deal, giving a maximum of Pounds 500 to new
borrowers putting down at least a 10 per cent deposit as an alternative to a
one-year discount. Andy Kuipers, mortgage product manager at Northern Rock,
said the society had seen its best month ever in terms of new business
during August, helped by the cash-back deal.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): Beware of
salesmen who say they know what's coming - Budget Countdown, Be ready for
surprises / Often the changes that are most likely to affect investors are
hidden away in the press releases which accompany the budget
</HEADLINE>

It can be a mug's game trying to predict the Budget. Even though the old
system of 'purdah', in which Treasury ministers refrained from comment for
weeks ahead of the budget day, has been abolished, the government still
frowns on leaks.
The most famous leak was in 1947, when the Labour chancellor Hugh Dalton
revealed, on his way in to the Commons, the planned rise in cigarette duty
to a reporter from The Star. Dalton was forced to resign.
Beware of people, particularly financial-services salesmen plugging
products, who are confident in their predictions of what will be in the
Budget. The chances are they do not know.
Many of the substantial budget announcements of recent years have come as a
surprise, most notably Norman Lamont's decision to raise the rate of value
added tax in order to fund a reduction in the poll tax.
Chancellors usually like to have a nice surprise up their sleeve. Nigel
Lawson, for example, aimed to abolish one tax every budget. A popular
rhetorical tactic is to hint at some unpopular measure during the speech -
in an attempt to lure the opposition into howls of protest - only then to
announce that the government has decided not to make the change after all.
Nowadays, there is so much complicated detail in the budget that the
chancellor can only give the broad outline in his speech. Kenneth Clarke,
when presenting the first unified budget last year, rattled through the
details in a little over an hour.
The inevitable result is that some of the changes that are most likely to
affect investors are hidden away in the press releases which accompany the
budget. Sometimes, in all the headlines about changes in income tax rates
and public spending totals, it can take newspapers and accountants some days
to realise that the treasury has quietly closed some loophole or other.
But for many people, the principal subjects of interest will be the main tax
rates, reliefs and allowances. The table here provides a checklist for
budget day, so that readers can see what has changed.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4): Pep up, but
delay retirement - Budget Countdown, What can you do? / There may be changes
to the rules governing personal equity plans and the age at which personal
pension annuities must be taken

One benefit of the move to a November Budget has been a reduction in the
temptation for investors to be rushed into action before a chancellor
speaks.
The combination of a March Budget and an April 5 tax year-end meant in the
past that financial-services firms could entice investors through a
combination of fear and greed, by suggesting that the chancellor was about
to close some lucrative tax haven such as the Business Expansion Scheme.
Now that there are four months between the Budget and the tax year-end,
investors can afford to take a more considered view of tax planning. Of
course, there is nothing to stop the chancellor imposing measures
immediately on Budget night, as he did last year with the change to capital
gains tax indexation.
But that move was met with howls of protest from traditional Tory
supporters, and was followed by an amendment to the Finance Bill to give
transitional relief to individuals who lost out from the measure.
Traditional Budget changes, such as increases in excise duties, will no
doubt continue to be imposed immediately, or within a few days of the
chancellor's speech. But after last year's furore, it seems likely that more
complex tax changes will be phased in on April 5, save perhaps for the
closing of outrageous tax-avoidance loopholes such as payment in wine to
avoid National Insurance contributions.
Nevertheless, investors may well be tempted by pre-Budget hoopla to rush
their money into tax-efficient schemes. Advisers warn against this strategy.
'In general terms, if you haven't done it, then don't panic to do it before
the Budget,' says Mr David Harris, of Chantrey Vellacott.
Most people expect the thrust of the chancellor's Budget to be on the
public-spending side, rather than on taxation. The chancellor appears to be
aiming to get the public finances in as healthy a state as possible, so that
he can cut taxes in the next Budget, closer to the likely election date.
Few see any reason why the government would want to abolish its existing tax
havens, such as personal equity plans (Peps) and tax-exempt special savings
accounts (Tessas).
'My guess would be that, if he were to do anything with regard to Peps, it
would be to slightly relax the rules,' says Mr Harris. There is some talk of
an expanded Personal Savings Plan, he says, which would widen the range of
Peps to cover other investments, such as interest-bearing deposits.
If a change is possible, that only reinforces the advantages of waiting
until after the Budget before making a Pep investment. This year's
turbulence in world stock markets is another argument for investor caution.
However, the existence of a different deadline makes the case for long-term
investors to try to use up their Pep allowances at some point during the
current tax year. In 1996 or 1997, a general election could usher in a
Labour government, which might very well decide to abolish personal equity
plans (a course of action recently advocated by The Guardian).
Despite the impact of charges on the tax relief in early years, a Pep should
be a very good long-term tax shelter. Imagine what the tax-free dividend
income will look like once your investment has been allowed to grow for 25
years. So, provided you are prepared to take a long-term view, there is a
case for getting as much as possible into Peps while you can.
Budgets often incorporate technical changes which are very hard to
anticipate. But Mr Harris says he believes this one may allow holders of
personal pension plans to defer taking their annuities until they are 75,
instead of at retirement age under current rules.
Taking the annuity on retirement exposes the plan holder to two risks: that
he or she will die shortly afterwards, robbing their spouse of much of the
accumulated value of the plan; or that the annuity will be bought at a time
of low interest rates.
Given these risks, Mr Harris believes that those contemplating retirement
over the next month or so might find it advantageous to delay things until
after the Budget on November 29, to see if they can benefit from any change.
However, there is a counter-argument. Financial advisers have a perennial
fear that a chancellor will one day attack the tax-free lump sum element of
a pension, which seems a bit anomalous in view of the restrictions of other
middle-class tax reliefs, such as mortgage interest payments.
This could at last be the Budget in which the tax-free lump sum is attacked,
although it is a move which would not be popular with Tory voters. Nor would
it encourage the growth of personal pensions, an important government aim in
view of Britain's ageing population.
'It would be unfair to tax somebody who was retiring on the day after the
Budget more heavily than someone who had retired on the day before it' said
Mr Mark Bolland of Chamberlain de Broe. 'I suspect that if anything is done
it will happen from some future date and at a fairly low introductory
level.'
In short, there are no obvious options for those trying to beat the
chancellor's tax net. But if the Budget merely spurs investors to start
thinking about their tax planning, ahead of the end of the tax year, it will
at least have served as a useful wake-up call.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Benefit changes
could encourage return to work - Budget Countdown, The 'Green Budget' / An
independent research group thinks the chancellor may assist the lower paid,
rather than adjust tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Help for the lower paid may be one of the main themes of the chancellor's
Budget, according to the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies.
The IFS, an independent tax-policy research group, together with investment
bank Goldman Sachs, produced its 'Green Budget' this month, examining the
options confronting Kenneth Clarke.
In the view of the institute, the chancellor is unlikely to make substantial
cuts or increases in taxation. The main focus will be on public spending,
where cuts of around Pounds 5bn in the planned spending totals for 1995-96
will be welcomed by the gilts market.
However, the chancellor may alter the tax rules in a way that costs him
nothing, ie, which is 'revenue-neutral'. One option would be to freeze the
income tax allowances at their current level. A basic tax principle is that
these allowances should be increased in line with inflation, but in recent
years this has been honoured more in the breach than the observance.
This year, with inflation at only 2.2 per cent, the personal allowance would
only rise by Pounds 75 to Pounds 3,520, saving the standard-rate taxpayer
just 36p a week. As the IFS says, 'the complete absence of such indexation
would barely be noticed'. The chancellor could use the money saved by
freezing allowances to widen the 20 per cent band from the first Pounds
3,000 of taxable income to Pounds 4,000.
However, the IFS feels the chancellor may be more interested in reducing the
disincentives to work among the lower paid.
The fundamental problem is that benefits paid to unemployed people are
withdrawn when they take a job. Family credit is a measure designed to
alleviate this difficulty; it is paid to low-earning families with children
where one parent works at least 16 hours a week.
One possibility would be to extend family credit to childless people aged 25
and over. This measure would not be prohibitively costly.
Another reform would be to integrate income support and family credit, to
eliminate the administrative delay and uncertainty involved in switching
from one benefit to another.' The chancellor should seriously consider
integrating income support and family credit into one benefit with in-work
and out-of-work credits that would not suffer from interim gaps in benefit
receipt and uncertainty about entitlements once in work,' says the IFS.
'This would also improve take-up of family credit, which has been low since
1988.'
On the savings front, the IFS says that action on tax-exempt special savings
accounts is quite pressing, because Tessas will start to finish their
five-year tax-free status from the beginning of 1996.
'The most sensible short-run response would probably be to allow Tessas to
continue into the future, so as to avoid large shifts at the beginning of
1996,' the institute says.
The institute recognises that much of the money invested in Tessas was
simply transferred from other building society accounts - rather than
representing 'new' savings. Nevertheless, it argues that interest-bearing
deposits are the main form of savings for the least wealthy, and that the
taxation of most interest-bearing wealth in the UK is both unfair and
inefficient.
In the longer term, the IFS feels that it would be sensible to integrate
personal equity plans (Peps) with Tessas in a single tax-free savings scheme
with a higher contribution limit.
In Norman Lamont's last Budget, the tax advantages of Peps were reduced
slightly by a reduction in the tax credit on dividends. The IFS says that,
earlier this year, it seemed possible that the government might be
considering the abolition of the tax credit, combined with a reduction in
the rate of corporation tax.
Such a measure would help corporate cash flow and reduce the incentive for
companies to pay out high dividends, thus enabling them to retain more of
their profits for investment. However, abolition of the tax credit would
have an adverse impact on tax-exempt institutions, such as pension funds,
and Pep holders.
The departure of financial secretary Stephen Dorrell from the Treasury has
reduced the likelihood of such a change this year, says the IFS, although it
adds that 'this is an area which could well attract the attention of a
future government committed to supply-side reforms to stimulate investment
spending.'
On the more basic issues of life, the IFS says there might be some good news
for spirit drinkers in the Budget. The tax per unit of alcohol for spirits
is still almost twice that applied to wines and beer.
The chancellor has already committed himself to increase excise duties on
tobacco by 3 percentage points more than the rate of inflation each year,
and on petrol and diesel by 5 percentage points more than inflation.
But the IFS does not agree with those who think the chancellor will cut
excise duties to try to counter the threat of cross-channel shopping. It
points out that alcohol excise revenues have held up well after a year of
the single market. 'Increasing duties, particularly for beer, wine and
tobacco would raise more revenue than would be lost through any concomitant
increase in cross-border shopping.'
Overall, however, the IFS sees little scope for significant reform in tax
policy this year, with the chancellor likely to keep his powder dry for tax
cuts in 1995.

When the chancellor sits down to draft his budget speech next month, he will
not enjoy the luxury of starting with a clean sheet of paper.
The state of the economy, the political fortunes of the government, and the
potential sanctions of financial markets, are just some of the constraints
he faces.
But insofar as Mr Kenneth Clarke discovers that his text is already
partially written, he will have little difficulty in recognising his own
hand. The main constraints on the chancellor are self-imposed.
These start with last year's budget. Justifying significant tax increases -
some, like limitations on mortgage interest tax relief, and married couples'
allowances, as well as higher VAT on fuel, have still to take effect in full
 -and cuts in public spending, Mr Clarke said that he planned to 'sort out
the problem of public borrowing once and for all.' He said these measures
would 'eliminate government borrowing entirely by the end of the decade' and
'establish sound public finances into the next century'.
The priority afforded this matter was understandable. At the time, he was
confronted by a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of Pounds 50bn,
or 8 per cent of gross domestic product - way above the 3 per cent benchmark
generally considered prudent.
With cuts in public spending, and higher taxes, Mr Clarke was able to cut
the estimated PSBR to Pounds 38bn in 1994-95. This was subsequently revised
down to Pounds 36bn in the summer forecast, and private sector economists
are even more bullish, predicting a Pounds 30-34bn outturn. This is the
result of higher than forecast economic growth buoying tax revenues, and
allowing reduced social security spending, as more people take jobs.
While this favourable trend in public finances might have been thought to
offer Mr Clarke more room for manoeuvre, he has made it fairly clear that,
at least in the short term, his focus is more narrow. He has said that, even
if the PSBR is undershooting, 4.5 per cent of GDP is still too large for tax
cuts to be considered. Economists reckon that Mr Clarke will probably only
consider tax cuts when the PSBR is down to the Pounds 25bn, or 2-3 per cent
of GDP, level.
Even more telling, arguably, was Mr Clarke's comment last month, at the time
of the rise in UK interest rates, that it was 'hopelessly premature' to
think in terms of tax cuts.
For the time being, cutting the PSBR - the government sees it falling to
just Pounds 2bn by 1988-89 - matters more than easing the burden on
taxpayers.
Mr Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London,
comments: 'He has clearly gone out of his way to put the UK fiscal position
on a sound footing. He is saddled with very aggressive PSBR targets. The
PSBR, to this particular government, at this particular stage in the cycle,
is sacrosanct.'
The conclusion, says Mr Geoffrey Dicks, chief UK economist at NatWest
Markets, is that 'we can only expect a neutral budget overall'.
Clearly, the views Mr Clarke has articulated are the product of briefings
and forecasts from Treasury economists. But whether he is objectively
constrained, in the manner he believes, is more of a moot point. Mr Dicks
comments: 'There is a chance that, in two months time, the UK economy will
be a little weaker than the current Treasury forecast.' He argues that the
current forecast of 3 per cent growth in consumption expenditure, both this
year and next, looks to be on the high side.
'If he hadn't boxed himself in on the tax side, he could have taken the view
that he could go easier on taxes,' said Mr Dicks. 'If anything is to give,
it will probably be in the form of lower interest rates than the market is
currently predicting.'
Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura in London, comments: 'The
constraints are largely ideological, not objective. I don't think the state
of public-sector finances is a problem for the government. I expect that it
will come lighter much quicker than the government thinks.'
Mr Dillow's argument is based on the view that private-sector investment can
be expected to rise quite fast, while a squeeze on corporate profits will
result in falling private-sector savings. Given, as a matter of economic
identity, that savings in an economy must equal investment, Mr Dillow argues
that these developments in the private sector are likely to lead to a
reduction in the public-sector deficit.
Another constraint on the chancellor is the 'leave well alone' argument.
Most economists agree that, whether by accident or design, the UK is
presently enjoying a particularly well balanced economic recovery. In 1993
the consumer pulled the economy out of recession. In 1994, however, the
engine of growth has been more the rise in exports, on the back of
sterling's devaluation after the 1992 exit from the ERM, and a pick-up in
European demand.
'We are moving away from the Reaganomics of tight money and loose fiscal
policy that always benefits the consumer,' says Mr Dicks. 'Now, for the
first time since 1985, we have a virtuous combination of exports leading the
recovery and investment going ahead of consumption.' This is a situation
which Mr Clarke may well decide to leave alone.
If past commitments and the present benign nature of the economic recovery
represent two constraints on the chancellor, politics constitutes a third.
Mr Robin Aspinall, strategist at brokers Panmure Gordon, comments: 'What he
most wants to do is win the election next time. His priority will be to do
as much as he can to achieve tax cuts later.' Mr Hawkins, of Bank of
America, adds: 'There is no real reason to rock the boat on an economy that
is well placed for an election in, say, 1996.'
The corollary of gratification later is delayed gratification now. So far as
the politics goes, however, the picture is more complicated. For with the
government so far behind in the polls, it may be that Mr Clarke is tempted
to take some steps to lay some sort of groundwork to boost its popularity.
Insofar as he is tempted down this road, however, he will be likely to keep
a wary eye on the capital markets. Mr Hawkins comments: 'It is important to
produce a budget that impresses the capital markets. At the moment they are
focusing on big-deficit countries, and this means a weak currency, and
higher interest rates.'
While the UK has a large deficit, the trend is clearly in the right
direction, and the recent strength of sterling suggests a degree of market
affirmation. Mr Clarke will be unlikely to jeopardise this recently gained
credibility, of which sterling's strength is a symptom, with any fiscal
heroics in the budget.

FT  21 OCT 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Investors are
the victims of a market tug of war - Keynote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has, at least, been a better three months for people with savings
deposits. After the half-point rise in bank base rates on September 12,
savings rates have been edging higher, and some of the medium-term
fixed-rate contracts offer upwards of 8 per cent gross. That is a useful
premium compared with the beginning of the year when you were lucky to get 7
per cent.
The stock and bond markets, however, have been unsettled by the upturn in
short-term interest rates. Earlier, during July and August, the FT-SE 100
Index had managed a decent rally from below the 3000 level, for a total gain
of some 12 per cent by August bank holiday weekend.
But then came that rise in UK base rates to 5 3/4 per cent, which closely
followed interest-rate increases in the US, Italy and Sweden. The
longer-term interest rates on Government bonds edged up all around the
world. So the Footsie index suffered a very bad September, dropping some 7
1/2 per cent. By early October it was back below 3000 again, but only
briefly, as the better value triggered new buying.
This choppy, unsettled pattern could be with us for some time. It reflects
the strong two-way pull on the world's securities market, with equities
encouraged by generally buoyant economies but bonds worried by excessive new
issues and by fears of resurgent prices - although there are precious few
signs of serious inflation so far outside certain of the commodities
markets.
The lack of any reliable trend has been upsetting to private investors, as
shown by the losses reported by ShareLink, the private client stockbrokers
who trade over the telephone. When small investors are nervous they don't
panic but they do nothing, which for their brokers is worse. Unit trust
sales have also begun to taper off a little, with August's net sales less
than a year earlier.
Professional investors have also often had a bad time. Some of the biggest
international securities firms, such as Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and
SG Warburg, have been caught by the adverse conditions. New York firms, in
particular, have been severely hit by this year's heavy losses in bonds,
where the key interest rate on 30-year US Treasury bonds edged up from 7.6
to 7.8 per cent during the third quarter.
Fixed-income bonds are supposed to be safer than equities, but in 1994 they
have been much more dangerous. Those US long bonds, for instance, have
fallen in value by about 30 per cent since they peaked in price a year ago.
In 1993 there was colossal speculation in bonds. This year's crash has to a
large extent represented the unwinding of last year's bubble. The process
has continued during the past few months. We can expect further shocks as
financial institutions clear out their books and write off their losses.
In the meantime, though, the world's equity markets, taken as a whole, have
been remarkably stable. During the third quarter, for instance, the
FT-Actuaries World Index (expressed in sterling) declined by under 1 per
cent. On the end-September calculation it was down no more than 1 1/2 per
cent during the first nine months of the year.
Of course, there have been fluctuations in various countries. Japan's equity
market was quite strong during the early months of the year, but the Nikkei
average eased about 5 per cent during the summer quarter.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Average rose by 6 per cent over the same
three-month period, and got back to within a whisker of its all-time peak.
Those fashionable emerging markets picked themselves off the floor after the
shakeout of the first half, and managed a strong summer rally. The IFC Index
of emerging equity markets rallied by 24 per cent during the July-September
quarter.
This is precisely the time of the economic cycle when you would expect
equities to outperform bonds. Around the world, except maybe in Japan, the
economic news is good. The latest official statistics show year-on-year
economic growth of 3.8 per cent in the UK and 4.1 per cent in the US. The
global economy as a whole, boosted by rapid growth in Asia and the Pacific
region, is expanding faster than at any time since 1988.
For investors in UK equities this good news boils down to earnings per share
growing at anything up to 15 per cent and dividends at 8 per cent. British
companies are now very liquid, so that the debt problems of a few years ago
are well behind them.
The British economy is now looking better-balanced than for a very long
time. A potential balance-of-payments problem is being dissipated by the
excellent performance of exporters. Personal incomes are hardly rising net
of tax increases, and spending is increasing only slowly, with no sign of
the kind of consumer boom that has destabilised the economy in the past.
Of course, the downside of this is that the housing market is flat, the
'feelgood' factor is missing and the government is deeply unpopular. These
problems will not worry chancellor Kenneth Clarke overmuch as he prepares
for his Budget in a month's time, because he has two more years to turn
things round. But the big issue is whether financial pressures on a global
scale will now disrupt the Tory government's plans to stage another dramatic
electoral revival.
So far, western governments have been fighting a threatened resurgence of
inflation. But although commodity prices have been climbing, a general
inflationary threat has yet to become apparent.
Instead, the free-spending western governments that are proposing to borrow
more than Dollars 400bn for the second year in a row are facing a relentless
rise in the interest rates on bonds. Those rising rates are in turn
threatening to squeeze equity markets in a vice-like grip.
Thus, government issues are clashing with private-sector money-raising.
Numerous equity new issues in the UK have been withdrawn, or have struggled
to hold their flotation prices. Too many have in any case been of poor
quality, with prominent recent newcomers such as McDonnell Douglas
Information Systems and Aerostructures Hamble being forced to issue profit
warnings.
Big institutional investors are running out of money to buy shares. Life
assurance new business has slumped in volume, and pension funds are trying
to switch part of their portfolios from equities towards government
gilt-edged.
Now that UK equities are yielding around 4 per cent they are better value
than at the start of the year. But investors looking for a steady trend may
be disappointed.
We are going through an unstable period when there may be forced sellers of
securities around. If you have strong enough nerves and cool enough
judgment, however, you will see it as a time of increasing opportunity.

FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Brewers wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brewing shares became one of the stronger flavours of the week following a
note from James Capel suggesting the industry was heading for a spate of
takeovers. Scottish &amp; Newcastle (up 4 on Wednesday) rose 11 to 519p,
Whitbread added 8 at 549p and Bass gained 5 at 541p.
According to Capel, the sector is running out of price war options and is
ripe for consolidation. The securities house sees the regulatory regime now
more benign than it was at the end of the 1980s, and expects at least one
major merger within a framework of 12 to 18 months.
From this distance, best bets among analysts point at a merger of S&amp;N and
Whitbread or a deal between S&amp;N and Courage, currently owned by Foster's
Brewing. The sector is in sore need of a boost. It has underperformed the
market by 4 per cent over the past two months and by more than a fifth on a
two-year view.
However, rationalists pointed to the low level of volume in the sector
yesterday. In fact, Grand Metropolitan, down a further penny to 415p on the
back of weak dollar worries, was the most active drinks stock, turning over
2.6m shares.
RTZ failed to benefit from the recent surge in copper prices as the shares
were restrained by a sizeable seller.
The weakness in the US dollar pushed copper to Dollars 2,600 per tonne in
London, its highest since January 1991. The metal represents some 30 per
cent of RTZ's profits but yesterday one securities house was said to be keen
to offload half a million shares. Disinterest in that stock saw the
registered shares decline 7 to 867p.
Oil shares remained under fire, weakened by another poor showing by the
dollar and general nervousness ahead of the US oil sector's third-quarter
reporting season which starts on Monday with results from Exxon, the
industry leader. Shell reports on Thursday.
'The institutions are reluctant to deal until we see a definite pattern
emerging in the US majors,' said one UK specialist, who added that the
recent decline in the US currency had upset sentiment in oils. BP dipped 4
1/2 to 403p on 7.2m traded and Shell 5 to 706p on turnover of 2.8m.
Azlan, the computing products group, was one of the market's worst
performers, plunging 32, or 20 per cent, to 128p as dealers reacted to talk
that one institution was seeking to offload a large block of stock. However,
it was clear that no abnormally large deals had taken place; turnover in
Azlan was a mere 20,000.
Telecoms put up a good performance in the face of the general market unease,
and a poor opening on Wall Street, as dealers reacted to the stream of good
results from cellular telecoms such as Sprint, Lin and Nokia. Vodafone ran
up 6 to 207p on turnover of 10m.
A number of institutions took advantage of the recent share price slippage
in the regional electricity companies (recs) to pick up what was seen as
'cheap' stock.
The sector is now in its 'closed period' but specialists point out that the
recs offer strong long-term upside in the form of outstanding dividend
potential, the prospect of big gains from the sale of stakes in the National
Grid and expected share buy-backs. Among the best rises yesterday were
Midlands, up 13 at 732p, London, ahead 11 at 687p and Manweb, 10 higher at
774p.
BTR, the subject of a buy note from Smith New Court, dipped a penny to 308p
in turnover of 13m shares, although the bulk of the volume came via a
tax-related, bed and breakfast, deal which saw 8.7m shares traded at 301p.
High street chain WH Smith improved 4 to 454p as Panmure Gordon reiterated
its positive stance on the stock. There were also a couple of
recommendations for Storehouse, a penny up at 219p.
Iceland climbed 8 to 170p, with dealers saying UBS had issued a buy
recommendation and that Hoare Govett was supporting the stock.
Strong earnings from American Airlines - an eighth ahead of the top end of
US analysts' forecast range, and the company's healthiest result for five
years - helped lift British Airways 8 to 382p in 2.3m dealt.

FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vickers hint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Vickers advanced 7 1/2 to 170 1/2 p in turnover of 4.8m following buy
recommendations from SG Warburg and Credit Lyonnais Laing and - towards the
close of the session - persistent talk of a possible takeover move from
Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company.
The engineering sector's other takeover situation, the potential bidding
auction for submarines group VSEL between British Aerospace and GEC,
continued to keep the market guessing. VSEL put on 20 at 1320p while BAe
firmed 2 to 480p. GEC, again affected by heavy volume, shed 2 to 282p in
turnover of 14m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Troubled pharmaceuticals group Fisons moved forward 3 to 116p as the
presence of some very large trades sharp-ened the perennial bid
spec-ulation.
A block of 9.2m shares dealt last week but, because of rules governing
unusually large deals, only announced yesterday, contributed to total
turnover of 15m, the highest since December last year.
Subsequently it was announced that Capital Group, the US investment fund
which held 6.1 per cent of the company, had reduced its stake to 5.84 per
cent. But that sale only represented some 2m shares.

FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Tunnel shares at new low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel plunged to a new low for the year, losing 12 at 199p in heavy
volume. Turnover in Paris was 9m shares, but for once it was the London
volume that caught the eye with 3.5m shares changing hands in what traders
described as a serious weight of selling.
Not helped by yesterday's press trip train failure, the awesome downtrend in
the shares - they were Pounds 6 earlier this year - is a direct reflection
of the bearish sentiment that has built up this week in the wake of the
group's sharply reduced 1994 revenue forecast.
There were clear signs yesterday that UK shareholders - 25 per cent of the
shares are held on this side of the Channel with the majority owned by
Continental holders - were being shaken out as the stock came within sight
of its 184p all-time low.
Eurotunnel has forecast that its revenue for this year will be around Pounds
34m: analysts suspect it needs above Pounds 700m to cover the cost of its
borrowings.

FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Early gains wiped out by US inflation
concerns - Market report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another attempt at a rally in the UK stock market fell apart yesterday
afternoon when US markets and the dollar reacted badly when news of a
substantial rise in the October business index of the Federal Bank of
Philadelphia revived fears of serious inflationary pressures.
An early gain of 22 points on the FT-SE 100 Index was wiped out as Wall
Street opened, although the UK stock market just managed to hold in positive
territory at the close. At least two large trading programmes were caught in
the market's sudden downswing, provoking arbitrage trading between stock
index futures and equities.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 was 2.4 up on the day at 3,063.2 after peaking
at 3,083.2. The blame for the reversal of confidence was put squarely on the
Philadelphia Fed; its diffusion index more than doubled this month, with the
prices component also unexpectedly strong. US federal bonds declined sharply
and Europe soon felt the effect.
Of the day's two large trading programmes, one was a protected programme
which appeared to be unwound through the market before the details reached
the trading screens. The earlier programme was largely completed before the
market turned off.
Trading programmes are somewhat risky operations in the current market
volatility and there were hints yesterday that a UK investment bank planned
wide-ranging staff cuts. Rumours of another round of swingeing cutbacks in
the City of London have been circulating for the past month.
The session was alive with developments which could have affected market
trading, but dealers said other factors were brushed aside by the
Philadelphia bank's announcement. Comments by the president and the chief
economist of the Bundesbank on currency prospects were swamped by later
developments. On the domestic front, markets made little immediate reaction
to the resignation of a junior minister as the UK government faced a
political storm over allegations of improper payments. Domestic money supply
figures were also taken calmly.
Trading volume in equities, taking in the trading programmes, rose by 10 per
cent from the previous session's level to a total of 660.3m shares through
the Seaq electronic network. Non-Footsie business made up around 58 per cent
of overall business. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 3.7 at 3,524.9.
The uncertainty over the US dollar that has become the chief feature of
stock markets over the past fornight showed itself yesterday in further
switching towards the UK financial sectors, which are seen as less
vulnerable to international currency factors. Bank shares registered useful
gains on a day when the final picture was somewhat gloomy.
The blue chip dollar stocks looked better at first and continued to hold up
until the London close, escaping the effects of comments from the US
Treasury that currency intervention was not planned. However, UK traders
expressed some nervousness when the dollar renewed its setback after the
close of the London market. The Dow Industrial Average, 23 points off in UK
trading hours, extended its loss later.
In addition to its worries over the dollar, the UK market this morning faces
a further test of confidence when the gross domestic product numbers for the
third quarter are published.
City forecasts are for a further rise of less than 1 per cent, compared with
the 1.1 per cent growth for the previous three-month period. A stronger
figure, and some estimates range up to 1 per cent growth, could cause some
nervousness as the stock market braces itself for the budget, planned for
the end of November.

FT  21 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures had a ragged day, barely ticking over for the most of
the session in low trading volume, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,073 at the official 4.10pm close, up
three points. At this level the premium to the cash market was around 10
points, and the fair value premium 15 points.
Contract numbers were sharply lower at 10,119, down from 12,822 on
Wednesday. This reduces the average volume for the week so far to little
more than 12,000 lots.
The average size of deals is said to have shrunk dramatically as dealers
keep a tight rein on their books in what traders describe as the complete
absence of feel over direction.
There was a smattering of institutional business but for the most part the
game was left to the local, independent traders. There was little serious
pressure one way or the other on the cash market.
The premium to cash equities at the close was about as narrow as it had been
all day.
Stock option turnover was 39,643 lots, broadly in line with the 39,813
registered in the previous session. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE volume accounted
for 27,000 contracts.
Guinness was the busiest individual stock option with 1,550 lots dealt. BP
(1,243 lots) and HSBC (1,160) were also actively traded.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow tumbles as data upset
bond market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday as unfavourable economic news sent bond yields
surging, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.89 lower at 3,911.15, while the
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 3.43 at 466.85. Declining
issues outnumbered advances by 1,489 to 688 on the New York SE after heavy
volume of 331m shares.
The Nasdaq composite slipped 2.38 to 768.24 and the American SE composite
shed 0.50 to 457.76.
The catalyst for the downturn was a revival of pessimism in the bond market.
The recent confidence established there was severely shaken by two sets of
data suggesting that the economy was growing at an unmanageable pace and
inflationary pressures were mounting.
The Commerce Department announced a 4.4 per cent jump in housing starts last
month, to an adjusted annualised rate of 1.5m units, the highest since last
December. Even more disturbing was news from the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve that its index of business act-ivity had surged, while prices paid
and received were up sharply.
The data pushed up yields on the inflation-sensitive long bond to just below
8.00 per cent, a level at which stocks could lose much of their relative
attraction.
The resurgence of interest rate fears, suppressed over the past fortnight,
overshadowed the steady stream of mostly positive earnings news flowing into
Wall Street.
IBM, still the bellwether of the technology group, slipped Dollars  3/8 to
Dollars 75, even though its third-quarter net income of Dollars 1.13 a share
easily beat the consensus forecast of analysts.
But General Motors failed to measure up to expectations and its stock was
punished as a consequence. The value of its share price fell 8.3 per cent,
or Dollars 3 7/8 , to Dollars 43 after the company revealed details of a
disappointing operating performance. Chrysler, which had turned in a solid
performance last week, was marked down Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 .
Sears Roebuck, the big retailing chain, posted net income that was nearly 20
per cent better than analysts were predicting, but the stock made scant
progress, gaining Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 48 1/2 . The negative sentiment
was evident in stocks across the board, whether or not they had earnings
news to report.
Among the Dow industrial components, General Electric lost Dollars 1 1/4 at
Dollars 49 and Procter &amp; Gamble fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 . Only
Alcoa, the aluminium producer, bucked the trend, adding Dollars 1 7/8 at
Dollars 90 1/4 .
On the Nasdaq, many technology stocks were lower, including Borland, which
plunged Dollars 2 1/4 at Dollars 9 3/4 after disappointing investors with an
operating loss.
However, there was a positive response to Microsoft's earnings statement.
The stock improved Dollars 2 to Dollars 59 3/8 on heavy trading of 8.5m
shares.
Canada
The Toronto market ended flat after moderate trading, having rebounded from
earlier lows with support from heavily weighted gold shares, which had
warred with interest rate jitters for dominance.
The TSE 300 index lost just 1.02 points on balance at 4,319.77, while falls
retained a narrow edge over rises by 438 to 324 after volume of 64.5m shares
valued at CDollars 743m.
Nine of the 14 sub-indices were down, led by transportation, financial
services, consumer products, and paper and forest stocks. Golds, real
estate, base metals and utilities posted gains. The New York spot price for
gold increased by USDollars 1.10 to USDollars 391.50 an ounce.
Brazil
Shares in Sao Paulo reacted cautiously to the announcement on Wednesday of a
package of financial measures aimed at reducing inflation and restricting
the inflow of foreign investment into the country.
The Bovespa index ended 343 or 0.7 per cent down at 47,244. Volume was a low
RDollars 260m.
A stock analyst said trading was both weak and volatile yesterday after a
reasonably firm opening. Initial market reaction to Wednesday's news was
relief that a tax on stock investments was introduced at no more than 1 per
cent, but trading then fell back in a climate of uncertainty, the analyst
added.
The market was expected to move in a narrow range over the next few days as
investors digested the package of measures.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Ericsson, Nokia hit new highs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group, saw its B shares rise SKr8
to SKr435 after an intraday, 1994 high of SKr442.50, with buying interest
boosted by strong interim results from Nokia, the mobile telephone based
Finnish conglomerate.
Earlier this month, Ericsson B registered a four-day gain of 8.2 per cent,
to SKr422, in response to a strong interim report from Motorola, of the US.
Late on Wednesday, Nokia, Europe's biggest manufacturer of mobile
telephones, reported eight-month pre-tax profits up from FM466m to FM2.29bn,
well above a consensus analysts' forecast of FM1.72bn. 'Expectations are
high for Ericsson now,' said a dealer.
Ericsson is due to present its nine-month results on November 17.
Yesterday's gain helped Sweden's Affarsvarlden General index to move forward
6.30 to 1,463.90.
Both Ericsson and Nokia, quoted in New York, had climbed overnight on US
investors' enthusiasm for the stocks. In Finland yesterday, Nokia hit its
1994 peak, ending FM39 up at FM678 after an intraday high of FM692.
But corporate news in Finland was mixed, and the Helsinki market reflected
this. Shares in the banking group Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP) fell FM1.95
to a new 1994 low of FM8.65 after it announced plans to raise FM2bn in a
complicated equity capital exercise; the market's Hex index fell 6.6 to
1,950.9.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan preoccupied by domestic
events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bourses mostly followed US markets, climbing in the morning on the Dow's
overnight gain, and descending in the afternoon after T-bonds slumped on
inflationary news from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, writes Our Markets
Staff.
MILAN was distracted by fast moving domestic economic and political
developments, which included the unions' tepid response to the government's
olive branch on pension reform, and the suspension of a parliamentary
sitting after government and opposition deputies came to blows.
The Comit index fell 2.63 to 618.97, after early pressure on Fiat, but the
real time Mibtel index reflected a late technical rally, picking up from a
low of 9,835 to finish 64 up at 9,954.
Mr Michele Pacitti at James Capel suggested that one reason for the market's
recent weakness was that domestic funds, which had invested heavily in
equities during September, were now switching to take advantage of more
attractive yields from bonds.
Fiat, meanwhile, found itself at the centre of a battle between speculators,
trying to talk the market bellwether down to L5,800, and investors anxious
for the price to hold above the psychologically important L6,000. In early
trade, the stock fell to L5,975, its first intraday dip below L6,000 since
late June, before picking up to finish L29 ahead at L6,080.
FRANKFURT offered a variation on the day's theme, opening low on fears that
an SG Warburg presentation would be bearish for equities, and worried by
pressures on Mannesmann and Volkswagen.
It surmounted these, with the Dax recovering 18.79 to 2,069.75 on the
session, and its bond market was resistant to US influences in the
afternoon; but the Ibis-indicated Dax succumbed, closing 9.98 lower on the
day at 2,048.15.
Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM7.4bn. The switch from cyclicals to
financials was still on. Deutsche Bank and Bayernhypo rose DM9.60 and
DM5.50, to DM732.80 and DM397.50 respectively; VW and Siemens paid the price
with falls of DM6.70 to DM436.30 and DM14.10 to DM614.90.
Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that Mannesmann, in
particular, could have been suffering from US selling as American holders
took profits on the shares, and on the D-Mark. After a two-day fall of DM30,
the stock showed a session gain of DM12.50 to DM385.50.
Meanwhile, another high flyer flew even higher, the computer software group
SAP hitting a new high of DM940, up DM65 or 7.4 per cent on a 194 per cent
jump in nine-month operating profits.
PARIS fell after the release of the US data but then recovered its
equilibrium. The CAC-40 index ended off 8.94 at 1,867.37 after a low of
1,860.
A further setback sent shares of Eurotunnel into a dive as a train due to
take journalists on a demonstration run from London to Paris broke down just
before it was due to leave the station.
A back-up train was later used and Eurotunnel said the journey had been
successfully completed in under the scheduled three hours. The shares, which
had dropped to FFr15.85 early in the session, managed to recoup some of the
loss, closing FFr1.65 off at FFr16.00.
Generale des Eaux slipped FFr8 to FFr446 before it announced after the close
that it expected a 4 per cent gain in full-year profits, after a 5 per cent
rise in first-half data.
Accor shares dipped FFr6 to FFr551 on news that the hotel group expected
next week to report a first-half net loss.
ZURICH saw an early technical rebound run out of steam on worries about
higher interest rates, and the SMI index finished 1.1 ahead at 2,530.9, off
a high of 2,547.6.
UBS bearers fell SFr11 to SFr1,245, with some investors said to be
disillusioned at the prospect of a long battle with BK Vision over the
bank's plan for a single share category.
Pharmaceuticals recouped some of their recent losses. Roche certificates
added SFr25 at SFr5,675, Ciba rose SFr10 to SFr715 and Sandoz put on SFr5 at
SFr647. Among insurers, Swiss Re, finding renewed favour with investors,
picked up SFr10 to SFr740.
MADRID lost early gains to close with the general index down 0.45 at 296.08,
undermined by Wall Street and domestic bond market losses.
TEL AVIV shook off the pessimism that followed Wenesday's bombing of a bus
in the city, and the Mishtanim blue chip index rose 5.56 or 2.9 per cent to
195.25.
Brokers said the underlying sentiment, too, was positive, given that the
market had only fallen by just over 1 per cent on the previous day's events.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Industrials extend rally
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The South African industrials sector moved ahead for the seventh consecutive
session as positive underlying sentiment remained in place, and local and
offshore investors vied for quality scrip.
Gold shares, however, came under pressure from the firmer financial rand
after a steady start, ending mixed as bullion's gain towards the close
provided only limited support. The industrials index rose 106 to 6,611,
taking its seven-day advance to 5.9 per cent. The overall index added 52 at
5,743 and golds put on 4 at 2,329.
Sappi extended recent hefty gains, firming R3 to a new high of R71. SAB rose
R2.65 to R90.15 amid foreign interest and Tiger Oats jumped R3 to R49. De
Beers was 75 cents better at R100.25 after a sluggish start, Anglos was 50
cents softer at R237.50 and JCI collected R2 at R106.
Stanbic appreciated R2 to R102 in an extension of Wednesday's R3.50 advance.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei advances as Hong
Kong halts slide
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Buying by arbitrageurs and public funds supported share prices, and the
Nikkei 225 average gained ground after moving within a tight trading range,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index rose 123.03, closing at the day's best of 19,991.90 after a low of
19,875.28. Corporate and overseas investors were also seen buying a broad
range of stocks.
Volume came to 270m shares, against 230m. Traders said investors will remain
inactive until the Japan Tobacco listing next week. Payments for the second
round of subscriptions were due yesterday, but a Japanese broker said
investor interest was low, with around only one in 10 investors paying for
the stock.
Meanwhile, some Japanese brokers were relieved that overseas investors
seemed to have started to return to the Tokyo market. Mr Jason James,
strategist at James Capel, commented: 'Foreigners are bearish about other
markets, including those in the US and continental Europe, and they are
shifting some of their funds to Japan.'
The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 8.24 at 1,588.71 and the
Nikkei 300 gained 1.78 at 290.72. Rises led declines by 568 to 417, with 186
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.55 to 1,304.52.
Steels rose on corporate and public fund buying. Nippon Steel, the day's
most active issue, firmed Y3 to Y390. Speculative buying supported photo
film maker Konica, which added Y16 at Y762, and Pacific Metals climbed Y24
to Y512.
High-technology stocks, which had lost ground on Wednesday on the higher
yen, were bought. However, Matsushita Electric Industrial shed Y10 to Y1,610
on reports of its dispute with the management of MCA, its US movie studio
affiliate.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, dipped Y50 to Y4,850 on continued
profit-taking, while construction issues were also lower.
DDI, the long-distance telecommunications operator, rose Y1,000 to Y898,000
in spite of reports of a planned rights issue to raise Y50bn. Other telecom
shares were also higher, with Japan Telecom up Y50,000 to Y3.88m and Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone adding Y12,000 at Y908,000 on foreign buying.
In Osaka, the OSE average improved 35.93 to 22,271.32 in volume of 30.4m
shares.
Roundup
A combination of factors provided renewed strength in some Pacific Rim
markets.
HONG KONG halted a three-day slide as bargain hunters returned, largely
ignoring another tepid government land auction. The Hang Seng index gained
68.72 at 9,388.78, having lost about 230 points earlier in the week.
Hang Seng Bank was ahead HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 55.25 on news that it
planned to redevelop three properties. Swire Pacific, which said an offering
of 30 flats was eight times subscribed, rose HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 56.
SHANGHAI's A shares soared 10.6 per cent amid renewed hopes that Beijing
would go ahead with plans to boost the market, including providing loans to
brokerages and allowing foreign funds to invest in A shares.
The index advanced 70.90 to 737.53 in greatly enlarged turnover of Yn4.13bn
in what was also seen as a powerful technical rebound after the index lost
around 40 per cent in the previous three weeks. Shenzhen's A index rose 9.81
or 6.4 per cent to 164.00.
TAIPEI was encouraged by comments from the central bank that there was
unlikely to be a further rise in interest rates. The weighted index added
92.27 or 1.4 per cent at 6,761.37. Turnover amounted to TDollars 68.26bn.
Following the government's statement, the overnight interbank rate fell to
6.149 per cent from 7.028 per cent.
Conglomerates led the gains, with President Enterprises up by the 7 per cent
daily limit to TDollars 63.50.
SINGAPORE finished firmer after a late surge in property-related stocks, but
brokers expected the market to resume its consolidation phase. The Straits
Times Industrial index rose 18.14 to end at the day's high of 2,382.25.
Among property issues, DBS Land climbed 16 cents to a new peak of SSDollars
5 in active trade on speculation that the company planned a new condominium
project which would contribute to pre-tax profits of about SDollars 700m.
SEOUL saw institutional profit-taking in large-capitalisation issues which
pulled the composite stock index 5.99 lower to 1,088.77.
Daewoo Heavy gained Won200 at Won16,300, recouping a decline of Won600 in
early trading. New Daewoo Heavy shares were issued as a result of its merger
with Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery.
BOMBAY was held back by sustained selling pressure which left the BSE
30-share index 47.48 lower at 4,281.99 as speculators off-loaded holdings in
A group or specified shares.
Brokers said that the selling pressure was expected to continue in coming
days because many domestic and foreign financial institutions were making
private placements in about 40 Indian companies that were raising funds from
the primary market.
SYDNEY made a late recovery, having been depressed for most of the session.
The All Ordinaries index finished 2.9 ahead at 2,016.3 in turnover of
ADollars 466m. The index had moved between 2,018.3 and 2,003.3.
Brokers remarked that some offshore selling of resource stocks was being
seen following their outperformance against industrials since the middle of
the year.
BHP was 4 cents firmer at ADollars 19.88, and in the resource sector MIM
moved up 8 cents to ADollars 2.78. News Corp retreated 8 cents to ADollars
8.42.
BANGKOK firmed on buying of bank stocks, and the SET index improved 20.19 or
1.34 per cent to end at the day's high of 1,521.61. Turnover was heavy at
Bt9.17bn.
Investors bought banks in the morning after Krung Thai Bank reported a 75.2
per cent rise in net profits in the third quarter to Bt2.4bn. The stock
finished Bt3.50 higher at Bt88, while Bangkok Bank advanced Bt10 to Bt228.
The banking sector was the biggest gainer, rising 3.42 per cent on Bt3.8bn
turnover.
Traders noted that foreigners had been accumulating stocks in anticipation
of good third-quarter corporate results.
MANILA succumbed to profit-taking, ending a six-day rally that had brought
the index back above the 3,000 level. The composite index lost 22.22 at
3,077.12.
Blue chips led declines, with Meralco A falling 2.50 pesos to 282.50 and San
Miguel B dipping 1 peso to 139.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Mixed showing for dollar following strong
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar traded in a fairly narrow range in Europe yesterday, providing
encouragement for those who believe the currency is due to rally, writes
Philip Gawith.
Strong economic data, which upset the US bond market, were shrugged off,
while the dollar also took little notice of comments from a Bundesbank
council member about the desirability of a stronger D-Mark.
The dollar ended in London at DM1.5016, from DM1.5009, and at Y97.325 from
Y97.15. It fell later in New York to DM1.4900 and Y96.95 on comments from Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, that the US government had no plans to
intervene in currency markets (to support the dollar), before finishing at
DM1.4927 and Y97.05.
Elsewhere, sterling recovered from a downward blip after the resignation of
a junior minister to finish at DM2.4325, from DM2.4296, and at Dollars 1.62
from Dollars 1.6188.
In Europe, the D-Mark was generally weaker as investors reassessed the
bullishness they had shown to the German currency in the run-up to last
weekend's elections.
Both the Swedish and Danish crowns firmed after a poll showed an increasing
number of Swedes in favour of joining the European Union. The Danish kroner
finished at DKr3.912 to the D-Mark, from DKr3.917, while the Swedish krona
closed at SKr4.774 from SKr4.8.
The dollar held above DM1.50 for most of the day, in spite of the buoyant
housing starts data, and the large jump in the prices component of the
Philadelphia Fed survey. Trade was very quiet, only livening up in the New
York afternoon when Mr Bentsen spoke.
Mr Bentsen was less emphatic than in recent months in supporting the virtues
of a strong dollar. His desire to see it 'a little higher' was clearly seen
as damning with faint praise.
Also unsettling for currency markets were earlier comments from Mr Tietmeyer
in Leipzig. He said: 'I hope the dollar remains a strong currency; the
D-Mark will remain so.'
A further concern for the dollar, at least against the yen, comes from a
Japan Development Bank's survey of manufacturers. Mr Michael Feeney,
economist at Sumitomo Bank in London, points out that 71 per cent felt they
could compete in world markets with dollar/yen in the Y90 to Y100 range.
More ominously, 86 per cent expect the rate to stay in this range for the
next three years.
Today the market is likely to take its lead from the expected release of the
German M3 money supply figure for September. This figure, together with the
Bundesbank council meeting next Thursday, are likely to be the main
short-term determinants of the dollar's progress.
There is considerable market speculation about whether the next move in
German interest rates will be up or down. Lower rates could provide some
support for the dollar, especially if combined with further rises in US
interest rates.
Earlier in the day, the market had focused on newspaper comments from Mr
Tietmeyer that any movement in Bundesbank rates again this year depended on
trends in the money supply, and other factors affecting inflation.
Analysts said the tenor of his comments suggested that the central bank was
clearly looking for further scope to cut rates, not to raise them.
Mr Paul Lambert, currency analyst at UBS in London, said a good M3 figure
would 'put interest rate reductions back on the agenda'. He predicted that
the Bundesbank might decide to revert to a variable rate repo at its weekly
auctions, and then follow with a final cut in official rates.
Before Mr Bentsen spoke, there was some comfort for dollar bulls from the
market's seeming unwillingness to take the dollar decisively below DM1.50.
Mr Malcolm Barr, economist at Chemical Bank in London, remarked: 'The market
is already rather over-extended in terms of short dollar positions, so it
held up rather well.'
The recent pattern of much of the liquidity being provided by the Bank of
England to UK money markets, coming in the form of late assistance,
persisted. After declaring a shortage of Pounds 700m, the Bank injected
Pounds 62m liquidity at established rates, and Pounds 665m late assistance.
The overnight money rate peaked at 8 per cent.
Cash rates were unaffected, with three-month LIBOR at 5 15/16 per cent. In
the futures market the December short sterling contract closed at 93.49,
from 93.52, on low volume. German call money eased to 4.80/4.85 per cent
from 4.85/4.90 per cent.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU milk prices to stay under
pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European Union milk prices have been below 1993 levels this year and are
likely to remain under pressure in coming years because of the EU's
enlargement and trade liberalisation, according to Mr Erhard Richarts, head
of the dairy group at Germany's agricultural market and price reporting
agency ZMP.
Mr Richarts, speaking at a dairy conference this week organised by Agra
Europe, the business information group, said the lower prices in continental
Europe are in sharp contrast to rising levels in the UK as companies compete
for supplies ahead of deregulation in November. But he stresses that the
British situation has little to do with the development of the market in the
rest of Europe.
EU prices have fallen as export markets to third countries have shrunk amid
increasing competition from New Zealand and Australia.
Next year prices will be further depressed when Finland, Norway, Austria and
Sweden join the EU. These countries all produce milk surpluses - Finland and
Norway are far more self-sufficient than the rest of the EU.
In spite of applying milk quotas to the four new members, the EU's
structural surplus of dairy products will increase to about 1.1m tonnes when
they join.
In addition, when the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal comes into
effect in the middle of next year, greater access for dairy imports is
likely to push this surplus to 2m to 3m tonnes, Mr Richarts says.
He sees little political will for cuts in milk quotas among EU agriculture
ministers.
He expects prices to firm slightly in the first half of next year but to
weaken later with pressure on the European dairy market increasing in the
late 1990s as the Gatt deal bites.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Most wool prices have moved up steadily this week. At the superfine Merino
end the market was a little erratic but below that increases predominated.
They only amounted to a few cents but this gradual strengthening is
preferred by the trade to the more dramatic increases which applied
particularly with finer Merinos earlier in the selling season. The Eastern
states market indicator in Australia closed at 762 cents a kg. 24 cents
higher than a week before, but well short of it's seasonal peak of 835
cents. The market recovery has occurred without special emphasis on China,
seen not only as the main international buyer but also as the best prospect
for growth. Confidence in wool stems from confidence in world economic
recovery, and major distortions either way would be unwelcome to the trade.

<TEXT>
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday announced that it had
made a promising gas and condensate discovery in the Norwegian North Sea
worth an estimated NKr40bn (Dollars 5.5bn).
Recoverable reserves of the discovery in block 34/11 are estimated at 60bn
cu m of gas and 125m barrels of associated condensate - a form of light oil.
Statoil said the exploration well has proved the existence of one third of
the estimated total quantities in the reserves and compared the size of the
discovery to that of the Gullfaks South field.
The company, which is in charge of the operations and has a 65 per cent
share in the licence, is considering drilling an appraisal well next year to
better define the discovery.
Norsk Hydro Produksjon, a unit of Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest listed
company, holds 20 per cent of the licence and BP Norge 15 per cent.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed forecast for timber
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The short-term outlook for the timber industry in Europe and North America
is bright as economic recovery gathers pace, the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe says in its annual review of market prospects for
forest products.
It expects consumption and production of all forest products to rise in both
1994 and 1995, bolstering prices. However, this masks significant variations
within the region.
Output of sawn softwood in Europe is forecast to increase on average by 5.2
per cent to 72m cu m in 1994 and by 3.3 per cent to 74.5m cu m in 1995.
In North America, however, output and consumption are expected to decline
next year after rising in 1994.
The ECE says that while there are signs of recovery in some eastern European
countries, the forest sector remains severely depressed in Russia and other
members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.
A combination of lower Canadian and Russian exports to Europe, and higher
European exports to the Near East, North Africa and the Far East will make
Europe a net exporter of sawn softwood for the first time this year and
next, the ECE says.
Sawn softwood consumption, production and trade in Russia, which have
declined dramatically since 1990, are forecast to fall again in 1994 but may
improve slightly in 1995. The removal of subsidies has sharply increased
transport costs, forcing uneconomic production facilities in western and
central Siberia to shut down.
Russian production in 1994 is likely to slump to about 23m cu m, compared
with more than 90m cu m in the former Soviet Union in 1990. Exports are
forecast to fall to some 5m cu m in 1994 but rise to 8m cu m in 1995.
Sawn hardwood consumption in Europe, which has fallen for the past decade,
is rising again.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian smelter in Dollars 280m
upgrade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's Novokutsnetsk aluminium smelter in Siberia is to be modernised over
the next four to five years with the help of VAW of Germany. The project
will cost about Dollars 280m.
This is the first time a Russian smelter will be fully modernised rather
than partially upgraded, says Mr Horst Peters, managing director of VAW
Aluminium-Technologie. The project will cut pollution from Novokutsnetsk
substantially, improve working conditions and reduce energy use by 20 per
cent.
Novokutsnetsk has two plants, built between 1942 and 1966 with a total
annual capacity of about 280,000 tonnes. The older plant will be permanently
closed and the other's capacity increased to 250,000 tonnes of
higher-quality aluminium.
Conditions for the 150,000 people living near the smelter had become so bad
because of pollution from the older plant's outdated technology that three
of its six buildings have already been taken out of operation.
Mr Peters says the project will be paid for by aluminium exports -
Novokutsnetsk has a licence for 60,000 tonnes of tax-free exports each year
between 1994 and 2000.
Finance is expected to come from supplier loans, private banks and,
possibly, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
VAW has been working on a feasibility study for some time and this assumes
that the aluminium price will average Dollars 1,650 a tonne and calculates
the modernised smelter's production costs at about Dollars 950 a tonne.
The contract to provide engineering services is worth DM20m (Dollars 13m) to
VAW.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper climbs to fresh highs as
metals surge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper's price on the London Metal Exchange reached its highest level for
nearly four years yesterday as investment fund and speculator activity
continued to boost all metals.
Aluminium reached a fresh four-year high and nickel touched a two-year peak.
Some analysts suggested there were solid reasons for the surge. Mr Wiktor
Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co, a Deutsche Bank subsidiary, said that
first-half demand for aluminium, copper and nickel had risen by 7 per cent
compared with the same months of 1993. He added that lead and zinc demand
was up by 4 per cent, which was 'twice as strong as even ardent bulls had
predicted'.
Meanwhile, added Mr Bielski, supplies had fallen along with exports from the
former eastern bloc - apart from those of aluminium. Also, some LME stock
was not immediately available because it was tied up by financing deals.
'Sensationally strong' fundamentals would ensure that, even if prices fell
because of profit-taking, they would recover quickly, he insisted.
However, Mr Nick Moore at Ord Minnett, an associate of Jardine Fleming,
warned there was a great deal of moth-balled capacity that producers could
quickly re-activate.
'The market is behaving as if stocks are at critically low levels and they
clearly are not,' he said.
Three-month copper, after moving briefly above USDollars 2,600 a tonne for
the first time since January 1991, closed last night at Dollars 2,584.25 a
tonne, up Dollars 44.75.
Aluminium closed up Dollars 34 at Dollars 1.774.50 and nickel was at Dollars
7,022.50, up Dollars 127.50.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: A glittering future for Turkey
 -The way is open for a gold mining industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The way is clear for a gold mining industry to develop in Turkey, according
to Mr Norman Hardie, vice president of projects and corporate development
for Metall Mining Corporation of Canada.
Hardie suggests that in five years Turkey might well have five gold mines
producing 12 to 15 tonnes of the precious metal between them.
Development of the industry can go ahead now that final approval has been
given by the environment ministry for a gold mine - Turkey's first - at
Ovacik, 100km north of Izmir. Behind the project is Eurogold, a joint
venture between Metall and Poseidon Gold of Australia.
Eurogold has been battling since 1991 to get various approvals - 11 in all -
and Mr Hardie says other mining companies with promising gold projects in
Turkey have been hanging back to see the outcome of Eurogold's pioneering
work.
Fierce opposition to the Eurogold project was based on local fears about the
use of cyanide to leach out the precious metal, a common practice throughout
the world. There was also concern about the impact the mine would have on
tourism - the deposit is only 12km from the historic city of Bergama.
Mr Hardie said the Ovacik mine would meet, and in some cases exceed,
international standards adopted in the most environmentally conscious
countries in the world. The mine would add interest to tourism in the area
by offering tours of the mill.
Eurogold has so far spent Dollars 15m on the project which is expected to
cost another Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m. Mr Hardie said two banks - Barclays
and Dresdner - have agreed to provide Dollars 31m of project finance.
The mine will have 200 employees and another 1,000 jobs will be indirectly
created.
Ovacik, a high-grade deposit with an average of nearly 10 grams of gold in
each tonne of ore, is expected to produce about 100,000 troy ounces of gold
a year at a full cost of Dollars 250 an ounce. Present reserves are enough
for at least eight years.
Other companies with gold projects in Turkey include Cominco of Canada,
Gencor of South Africa and the RTZ Corporation of the UK. Eurogold has also
spent Dollars 10m on exploring other parts of Turkey.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poland calls for radical CAP
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's agriculture minister, Mr Andrzej Smietanko, stressed in talks with
his British counterpart, Mr William Waldegrave, yesterday that Poland wants
to see radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which would allow it
to join the European Union.
'The same policy simply can't be extended to Poland because the EU can't
afford it and Poland doesn't have the resources to pay,' he said.
The Polish minister's comments are likely to add to the current debate in
the EU about whether the CAP can be extended to east European countries.
Mr Smietanko called for greater access for Poland to lucrative EU markets.
'We want access to markets in the EU: we don't just see the till box from
which to draw money,' he said.
The minister pointed out that 1kg of beef sells for the equivalent of 80
cents in Poland, compared with Dollars 2 in the EU.
But cheaper Polish producers were not being allowed to supply products to
the EU market, he said, in spite of declarations by politicians that the
market would be opened to them.
'Unfortunately, we have become net importers of food following the invasion
of EU products,' Mr Smietanko said.
He has highlighted three areas of Polish agriculture as priorities for
reform - these qualify for preferential credit terms from the government and
banks.
The first step is to boost milk production to meet domestic needs following
a 40 per cent drop in output in the past four years. 'We want to build up
those sectors where we have a chance of exporting to the world market,'
Smietanko said.
Mr Smietanko and Mr Waldegrave agreed to set up a working party to tackle
bureaucratic barriers to British investment in Poland.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Property: Upwardly mobile - The outlook for rents in the
City of London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Exactly what is happening to City of London rents? The question is of more
than academic interest to banks locked in refinancing discussions with
Stanhope, the developer whose main asset is the Broadgate complex in the
City.
If the banks are prepared to take an optimistic view of the outlook for City
rents, Stanhope could generate enough cash and asset growth over the next
few years to justify their continued support in its present form.
Yet the calculation might look rather different if they believe rental
growth prospects at Broadgate are unexciting.
Jones Lang Wootton, surveyors, recently forecast that rents for the very
best City property - including Broadgate - could reach Pounds 50 per square
foot within three years, from about Pounds 30 per sq ft today.
On that basis the value of Broadgate could rise to anything up to Pounds
1.5bn in three years, depending on what happens to property yields in the
meantime.
Rental growth of this magnitude would clearly transform Stanhope's position.
While up-to-date figures are not yet available, Broadgate Properties
(Stanhope's 50 per cent owned holding company for much of Broadgate and the
Ludgate office development) showed net assets of only Pounds 38m at June 30
1993, with its property assets valued at about Pounds 1bn.
According to some firms of surveyors, the green shoots of rental growth are
already visible. Richard Ellis recently estimated that top City rents
increased by 8.3 per cent in the third quarter of the year, with leases now
being signed at about Pounds 32.50 per sq ft, up from Pounds 30 per sq ft in
the spring.
After three years of development drought, the shortage of modern, quality
space in the City is part of the reason. Richard Ellis calculates that 7m sq
ft of central London office space was taken up in the year to the end of
September, substantially more than in the same period of 1993.
Mr Clive Arding, chairman of the City Business Division at Richard Ellis,
said: 'The City market is certainly starting to show movement. We have for
some months witnessed reductions in rent-free deals and incentives, but now
evidence of real rental growth is coming through for the best space, largely
as a result of the reduction in quality office stock.'
Richard Ellis also broadly agrees with Jones Lang Wootton's view of the
outlook, estimating that prime space will rise to Pounds 45 per sq ft by the
end of 1996 and Pounds 50 per sq ft by the end of 1997.
But not everyone agrees that rents are rising or that progress will
accelerate towards Pounds 50 per sq ft over the next few years.
One problem is that there is no longer anything like a 'normal' lease
structure, making comparisons between new lettings difficult. Most
agreements still involve rent-free periods and options for the tenant to
break before the end of the lease.
For example, Barings, the UK merchant bank, is rumoured to be negotiating to
take 240,000 sq ft of space at 60 London Wall at about Pounds 35 per sq ft
for the best space on offer.
If the deal is confirmed, it would be one of the largest City lettings in
recent years and could provide a benchmark against which others could be
judged. The snag is that the final terms could be anything but
straightforward.
Even if City rents are not yet rising, there seems little doubt that the
balance of supply and demand is gradually tilting in favour of landlords.
While there are plenty of smaller units available, especially around the
fringes of the City, there is no more than a handful of large, modern
buildings still available. Under those circumstances rents will surely rise
before long even if they have not already done so.
The question is whether rents head back towards the peak levels at the end
of the 1980s - importantly reducing the weight of over-rented space - or
make more sedate progress.
Mr Alec Pelmore, property analyst at merchant bank Kleinwort Benson, is
among the sceptics. He points to the pipeline of development and
refurbishments which will add to the supply of modern space.
He commented: 'Our view on rents for the best prime new space is that they
will indeed rise over the next two years to Pounds 35-Pounds 40 per sq ft.
But at this level there are a number of developers with sites and finance
waiting for the chance to rebuild or upgrade old unlettable buildings.
Supply will re-emerge, if only in the shape of a competitive pre-letting
market, and rents will then stagnate at this level.'
Kleinwort Benson estimates that there are plans for some 4.5m sq ft of new
or refurbished City office space already announced. More is being added to
the pipeline every week.
Last week, Argent, the developer run by Mr Peter Freeman and Mr Michael
Freeman, announced plans for a 120,000 sq ft development at Suffolk House,
near Cannon Street.
The optimists point out that this supply will be phased, with construction
of only about 1m sq ft of City office space being started this year and
perhaps 1.5m sq ft next.
With the banks still cautious, raising funding for speculative development
is difficult. Most developers are waiting for pre-lettings before raising
firm finance and putting the cranes up.
Moreover, in core City areas development sites of the right size and shape
are not easy to come by. This could constrain the development opportunities
as the economic recovery continues.
Besides, much of the development will simply replace old offices with modern
space rather than adding to the overall stock of offices.
Given the profile of City tenants, much also turns on the outlook for the
financial sector. Struggling stockbrokers and merchant banks are unlikely to
take acres of new office space.
In that respect recent disappointing trading statements from the likes of SG
Warburg and Hambros could be disturbing, especially if they presage a round
of City redundancies.
What Stanhope's banks make of all this remains an open question. They
should, at least, be in a good position to judge potential demand for space
from the financial sector.
They also have the best possible vantage point from which to judge whether
funding will be available for the developments planned in the Square Mile.
If the developers are starved of bank finance, the outlook for Broadgate
will be brighter.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: Signs of economic acceleration hit
Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON

<TEXT>
US Treasury bonds took a sharp downturn yesterday on a weaker dollar and
fresh signs of economic acceleration and inflation.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was 1 3/32 lower
at 94 13/32 , with the yield rising to 7.987 per cent. Earlier, it touched
the important psychological level of 8.00 per cent before receding slightly.
At the short end, the two-year note was down  3/16 at 99 17/32 , to yield
6.741 per cent.
Two reports were released during the morning that undermined the view that
the economy is growing at a manageable pace and inflation is under control.
The Commerce Department said housing starts last month climbed 4.4 per cent
to an adjusted annual rate of 1.5m units, the highest level since last
December. Although economists thought the upturn was temporary, traders took
the data as a sign that the series of five interest rate increases so far
this year had failed to slow growth sufficiently.
The pessimism deepened at mid-morning, when the market was handed a more
compelling piece of evidence to suggest the Federal Reserve would probably
have to lift rates again soon.
The monthly business outlook report issued by the Federal Reserve of
Philadelphia showed a sharp jump in its overall index of economic activity.
Even more troubling to the inflation-insensitive bond market, indices
measuring prices paid and received by manufacturers surged.
Bond prices, especially at the long end of the maturity range, plunged on
the news, which seemed to undo much of the confidence gained over the past
month. In recent weeks, most of the economic news has been favourable for
bonds.
A bad morning turned worse when comments by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
Treasury secretary, precipitated a fresh drop in the dollar. Mr Bentsen was
reported to have discouraged speculation that the government would step into
the foreign exchange markets to support the currency. The declines have
upset bond traders, who fear the dollar's weakness would make US-denominated
securities less attractive.
European government bonds were relatively resilient in the face of US
Treasury weakness, closing only slightly weaker.
'The weakness in the US hasn't prevented further outperformance by European
bond markets - that was very encouraging psychologically,' said Mr Jouni
Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg Securities.
Germany's bond market held up relatively well, supported by hopes of lower
M3 money supply growth data, which are likely to be released today.
Comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank President, and council
member Mr Otmar Issing indicating that M3 was set to continue falling
cheered the market. Most analysts are calling for a September rate of around
7.5 per cent. However, distortions caused by the recent introduction of
money market funds may push the number lower than that, some said.
A lower than expected number could revive hopes of further cuts in official
rates, especially after Mr Tietmeyer said the direction of German interest
rates depended on money supply trends and other factors which could affect
inflation. Regional consumer price data are expected early next week.
Dealers reported little investor activity, and said the bund market was
dominated by the futures pits. There, technical support of the December bund
future at 90.20 kept the market underpinned, though the contract breached
that level in after-hours trading on Liffe, falling to 90.16, down 0.21 on
the day.
UK gilts reacted more negatively to the US developments, easing by about
1/2 point.
According to one dealer, 'the US data were an excuse to sell a market that
has had a good run and was due for a period of consolidation'. Ahead of
Wednesday's auction, the gilt market is likely to react more negatively than
others to disappointing news, he added.
Traders reported little cash activity apart from switching into the new
five-year stock, which is currently trading on a when-issued basis.
Slightly stronger than expected UK money supply data added to the soggy
tone. 'The lending figures didn't help - they reinforced the view that the
economy is a bit more robust than some people have thought,' said Mr Nigel
Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International. The numbers
come in the wake of a buoyant CBI survey and stronger retail sales data,
released earlier this week.
French bonds fell by nearly half a point after the US data, their yield
spread over Germany widening to 75 basis points from 69 on Wednesday.
Among other factors, the market has been suffering from weakness in the
French franc, which has been depressed by political jitters ahead of the
1995 presidential elections, and the dollar.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Bonds: BankAmerica launches Dollars 500m
floating-rate note offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The eurobond market witness-ed a flood of floating-rate note offerings
yesterday amid difficult market conditions, as uncertainty about US interest
rates drove US and European government bond markets lower.
In the dollar sector, BankAmerica launched a Dollars 500m issue of five-year
floating-rate notes, with a coupon of 18.75 basis points over three-month
Libor.
Joint lead manager Goldman Sachs said it sold almost all its quota of bonds,
with demand spread across Europe and the Far East. Interest came from
commercial banks, fund managers, private individuals and some corporate
investors, Goldman Sachs said.
Goldman Sachs also led Ford Motor Credit's Dollars 250m offering of
five-year FRNs. The bonds, offering 20 basis points over three-month Libor,
also found widespread demand, it said.
'Interest in FRNs has grown substantially this year,' said a syndicate
official. 'Investors want to be protected in a rising interest rate
environment and many, in particular commercial banks, want that extra
pick-up in yield above their funding costs that FRNs offer.'
At the short-end of the D-Mark sector, IMI launched a DM300m offering of
three-year bonds with a coupon of 12 1/2 basis points over Libor.
Some syndicate managers said the bonds were tightly priced but joint lead
manager J. P. Morgan reported good sales around the 99.85 offer price. The
strongest demand came from UK institutional investors but there was also
substantial interest from Italian and German investors, it said.
'Many D-Mark investors have taken their money out of the fixed-rate D-Mark
market but with the D-Mark still well bid, they have stayed in the same
currency sector, moving instead to short-dated D-Mark FRNs,' said one
syndicate manager.
Depfa, Germany's largest private mortgage bank, returned to the French franc
sector, with a FFr2bn offering of four-year fixed-rate bonds, priced to
yield 27 basis points over French government bonds.
Depfa's second French franc eurobond was prompted partly by the success of
its debut offering in November last year, lead manager BNP said. BNP
reported demand from investors in Germany, Switzerland and France.
The Republic of Argentina's Dollars 500m global offering of five-year bonds,
launched on Wednesday, was priced yesterday at a re-offer price of 99.925 to
yield 350 basis points over US government bonds, at the top end of its
indicated spread.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Investors shrug off changes
in Brazilian rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK MCCURRY and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign investors yesterday played down the potential impact of measures
announced by Brazil to limit foreign investment flows.
A 1 per cent tax on new money brought into the stock market is unlikely to
put off long-term investors, and although an increase in the tax on eurobond
issues could depress issuance, the measure could increase the price of bonds
currently on the market.
'The fixed-income measures were expected and the stock market tax was half
expected, although a lot of people thought it might be higher,' said Mr
Wayne Perkins, a vice-president at Banco Norchem in Sao Paulo.
The stock market tax is the first equities tax for overseas investors since
Brazil's stock market was opened to foreigners in 1991, and the government
can increase the tax to up to 25 per cent if it feels the situation is
sufficiently serious.
However the measure had been widely anticipated. Sao Paulo's stock market
index fell 3 per cent on Wednesday, amid speculation about what the measures
might involve, but by lunchtime yesterday it was virtually unchanged.
Foreign investors regard the tax as largely symbolic, especially when
compared with the potential capital gains for Brazilian shares - so far this
year the main Sao Paulo index has appreciated by nearly 75 per cent after
more than doubling in value last year.
'The market could probably live with 5 per cent tax but anything above that,
combined with the currency appreciation, would deter a lot of investors,'
says Mr Sergio Goldman, an associate director at Bear Stearns in Sao Paulo.
Nor do analysts expect international equities issues by Brazilian companies
to be affected. Mr Anthony Parker, head of Latin American equity sales at
Baring in London, said companies considering the issue of ADRs were unlikely
to change their plans.
Investors expect the increase in the financial operations tax on Brazilian
issuers of eurobonds, to 7 per cent from 3 per cent, to lead some companies
and banks to reconsider potential offerings.
'We'll probably see some postponements and companies recalculating their
costs, but the tax increase is probably not enough to affect the core
market,' says Mr Edvaldo Morata of ING Bank in Sao Paulo.
It will still be cheaper to raise funds on the euromarket than on the local
bond market, and the measures could lead to an increase in the value of
Brazilian dollar-denominated paper already in the market as investors
perceive 'scarcity'.
Issuers of a Brazilian floating-rate notes - the latest in a number of
recent euromarket issues - reported a positive response from the markets.
Creditanstalt launched a Dollars 50m FRN for its Brazilian subsidiary, with
the issue closing 25 basis points up from its re-offer price of 99.25, after
the bonds were freed to trade.
'I suspect this will lead to tightening spreads because of the reduction in
supply. Investors will be prepared to bid up for Brazilian paper,' said Mr
Patrick Butler, of Creditanstalt.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kodak to spend Dollars 370m in
early debt pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eastman Kodak said yesterday that it would cost around Dollars 370m for the
company to pay off much of its debt early, together with a large portfolio
of derivative instruments.
The US photographic products company said that holders of Dollars 2.7bn of
its bonds had agreed to sell back their securities to the company. In all,
it had tendered for Dollars 4.8bn worth of bonds.
Kodak put the premium to buy back this debt at around Dollars 150m. US
interest rates have fallen since the fixed-rate instruments were issued,
making them worth a premium to their face value.
In addition, Kodak said it had now unwound most of its interest rate swaps,
derivative instruments which had been used to lower the overall cost of the
debt.
The cost of shedding these instruments, together with option contracts which
have been unwound so far, was Dollars 220m, Kodak said.
In all, Kodak had derivatives with a nominal value of Dollars 7bn backing
its debt, making this one of the biggest balance sheet reorganisations of
its kind ever undertaken.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: European expansion costs hit US
tissue group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Kimberley-Clark, US maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies nappies,
lost nearly 9 per cent of their value yesterday after the company's
third-quarter figures showed that it was being hard hit by the cost of
European expansion.
Sales revenues rose by 3 per cent to Dollars 1.8bn, but operating profits
fell by 4 per cent to Dollars 182.4m, and the company was only saved from a
decline at the bottom line by gains on a series of business disposals, a big
cut in the effective tax rate, and a surge in contributions from affiliates.
Because of these unusual items, net income rose 28 per cent to Dollars
141.8m, lifting earnings per share from 69 cents to 88 cents.
Kimberley-Clark has been spending heavily to expand the market for its
disposable nappies in Europe.
Yesterday it said operating profits declined because of increased marketing
and start-up costs associated with this push.
The company went on to cite higher fibre costs and increased research and
development costs as a negative factor in the results - the latter largely
related to the development of new or improved products and the expansion of
the European business.
Results in Europe were not only worse than in the comparable period last
year, but had also deteriorated from the second quarter of this year,
Kimberley-Clark said.
In addition, Mr Wayne Sanders, chairman and chief executive, said the
results for consumer bathroom tissue in Europe had suffered from industry
overcapacity, higher fibre costs and weak prices. However, he said the
company had begun to see some improvement in European tissue prices in
recent weeks.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lockheed, Martin Marietta lift
profits ahead of merger
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Lockheed and Martin Marietta, the two US defence companies which are due to
merge early next year, both succeeded in raising profits in the third
quarter in spite of flat or falling sales.
Martin Marietta's net earnings rose 14 per cent to Dollars 149m, Lockheed's
by 4 per cent - excluding one-off items - to Dollars 112m.
Lockheed's sales were 9 per cent down at Dollars 3.16bn. The company said in
the first nine months of the year, 66 per cent of sales were to the US
Department of Defence, while other US government sales took another 9 per
cent.
Numbers employed had fallen by 10,500, or 12 per cent, over the past year.
Martin Marietta's sales were up 4 per cent, or Dollars 96m, to Dollars
2.56bn. However, this year included a contribution from the space business
of General Dynamics, acquired last year.
At the time of acquisition, this business had sales of about Dollars 500m in
a full year.
Martin Marietta said its higher profits were due to the earlier merger with
GE Aerospace.
Similar benefits were coming through from the General Dynamics deal, it
said.
The merger between the two companies, announced at the end of August, has
the similar aim of combating the decline in defence orders. The combined
company will have annual sales of Dollars 23bn.
In New York, Lockheed shares closed down Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 69 7/8,
while Martin Marietta fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 44 1/2.

<TEXT>
McDonald's, the world's largest restaurateur and popular hamburger purveyor,
reported third-quarter income of Dollars 349.8m, or 48 cents a share, on
sales of Dollars 6.9bn, up slightly from the previous year's Dollars 310.9m,
or 42 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 6.2bn.
For the first nine months of the year, McDonald's earned Dollars 915.5m, or
Dollars 1.25 a share, compared with last year's Dollars 818.0m, or Dollars
1.10 a share.
Sales for the period were Dollars 19bn, compared with Dollars 17.4bn in the
first nine months of 1993.
McDonald's growth is driven primarily by expansion. During the first nine
months of this year, the company added 672 new restaurants, compared with
576 during the same period last year.
Of the new locations opened this year, 280 were in the US and 392 were
overseas. The company said it had an additional 449 restaurants under
construction at the end of the third quarter. The company currently operates
14,665 restaurants in 74 countries.
