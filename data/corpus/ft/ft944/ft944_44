FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Gillette increases to record
Dollars 171m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Strong sales growth in most worldwide markets helped Gillette, the US
shaving and consumer products group, increase third quarter net income by 19
per cent to a record Dollars 171m after preferred stock dividends, the
company reported yesterday.
Sales for the three months to September rose 12 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn,
operating profits were ahead 12 per cent at Dollars 297.7m, and earnings per
share - diluted slightly by an increase in issued equity - were ahead 18 per
cent at 77 cents.
Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected
good performances in Gillette's core businesses in most areas of the world.
In Europe, Mr Zeien said, demand was increasing mainly because of new
products, though improving economic conditions had helped in some markets.
The US continued to show substantial sales growth, and sales in developing
markets were more than meeting expectations.
Earlier this month Gillette announced that it was launching its new Sensor
Excel razor in the US market, backed with an Dollars 80m marketing campaign.
In Europe, where the product was launched last year, it has taken nearly 9
per cent of the wet-shave razor market.

Revenues at EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors, climbed
23 per cent in its third quarter from a year ago, to Dollars 2.56bn, writes
Richard Waters.
Mr Les Alberthal, chairman and chief executive, attributed the advance in
sales to strong growth in Europe and Asia. The growth supported a 13 per
cent increase in after-tax profits to Dollars 216.4m.
GM Acceptance Corporation, the financial services arm, reported after-tax
profits of Dollars 245m, up from Dollars 205m.

Pfizer and Schering-Plough, two of the fastest-growing drugs groups in the
US, shook off the pricing pressures in their home market with strong volume
gains during the third quarter.
Schering-Plough reported a 19 per cent jump in US prescription drug sales
compared with a year before, driven by Claritin, an antihistamine, which
achieved sales of Dollars 85m, and Proventil, an asthma therapy. Pfizer's US
sales were up 15 per cent.
However, the two companies' overseas experience differed markedly.
Schering-Plough's non-US sales rose 1 per cent, but would have fallen 2 per
cent had it not been for foreign exchange differences.
It blamed the fall on lower sales in Japan of Intron (A), an anti-viral and
anti-cancer agent, which reflects action by the Japanese authorities to
control healthcare costs.
Pfizer said its overseas sales grew 14 per cent. Its fastest growing product
overall was Norvasc, a cardiovascular drug, sales of which jumped 94 per
cent to Dollars 210m.
Pfizer reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 336.5m, or Dollars 1.09
a share, on sales up 11 per cent overall at Dollars 2.1bn. This represented
an 8 per cent increase on net earnings of a year ago, before one-off
charges.
Schering-Plough's net income rose 12 per cent, to Dollars 224m, on sales up
6 per cent at Dollars 1.1bn. Earnings per share in the latest period were
Dollars 1.17.
Bristol-Myers Squibb, meanwhile, reported a year-on-year sales increase of
only 2 per cent. It also warned that it may take an additional 'material'
charge against earnings to cover the cost of settling product liability
claims relating to breast implants it manufacturered.
Bristol-Myers Squibb's net income rose 2 per cent to Dollars 621m, on sales
up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.9bn, while earnings per share were Dollars 1.22.
Pre-tax profits in the period were 6 per cent higher, but the after-tax
result was held back by a higher tax charge resulting from the phasing out
of US tax relief for Puerto Rico manufacturing operations.

Microsoft

<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, reported a 27 per
cent increase in revenues for its first fiscal quarter, with net earnings up
32 per cent. Earnings were at the high end of Wall Street estimates.
Driven by strong demand for its Windows personal computer operating system
software and office applications programs, Microsoft has continued to
outpace all of its competitors in the PC software market.
Revenues rose to Dollars 1.25bn from Dollars 983m in the first quarter of
1993. Net income increased to Dollars 316m from Dollars 239m, while earnings
per share were 51 cents, against 39 cents in the first quarter of fiscal
1993. Per-share earnings were restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split
in May 1994.
'This was another solid quarter for the company,' said Mr Mike Brown,
Microsoft chief financial officer. 'These results reflect the ongoing
success of Windows as well as the continuing growth of our desktop
applications revenues led by Microsoft Office.'
North American sales represented 34 per cent of revenues, up from 33 per
cent, while European sales declined as a percentage of total revenues to 23
per cent from 28 per cent in the same period last year, reflecting slower
growth in the European PC market.
Sales of applications programs represented 60 per cent of worldwide
revenues.
Analysts said Microsoft, which dominates the markets for PC operating
systems and office applications, is now also moving ahead of competitors in
the PC database and word processing sectors, where it is winning market
share from Borland and WordPerfect.
Microsoft also introduced several new programs for home computer users
during the first quarter as part of a drive to expand significantly its
consumer marketing efforts.
Last week, Microsoft said that it intends to acquire Intuit, a leading
publisher of personal finance, tax preparation and small business accounting
software, for about Dollars 1.5bn in stock. The deal will give Microsoft
access to the emerging market for on-line financial services, such as
electronic bill paying.

chief to resign

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yu Pun Hoi yesterday resigned as chairman of the Ming Pao newspaper group
after the Hong Kong Stock Exchange censured him for failing, on three
occasions, to own up to a criminal record.
A senior stock exchange official said the exchange took seriously Mr Yu's
failure to observe its listing rules requiring directors to disclose past
criminal convictions.
'The issue is not what he did 14 years ago,' said Mr Herbert Hui, head of
the listing division. 'The issue is that 12 years on, as a director, he
negligently signed our listing agreement three times.'
The resignation of Mr Yu comes at a time of upset in Hong Kong's media
industry. The Oriental Daily group's foray into English-language publishing
appears to have foundered.
The acrimony surrounding last month's dismissal of the paper's editor
continues to sour relations between the publication's largely expatriate
staff and Chinese owners.
This week, most of the senior staff of the Eastern Express resigned and the
continued publication of the paper is in doubt.
Meanwhile, there was confusion at Ming Pao last night, and Mr Yu was unable
to say who would replace him as chairman. Mr Yu, and interests associated
with him, own 60.5 per cent of the company.
Since the disclosure last week that he had served a short prison term in
1979 for cheque fraud and possession of a firearm, Mr Yu has come under
intense media attention. His private life, about which little is known, has
been subjected to scrutiny, much of it barren.
On Wednesday, his peers deserted him when he was forced to step down from
the chairmanship of the Newspaper Society of Hong Kong, the colony's
publishers' association.
Significantly, representatives of the colony's two main pro-China newspapers
voted for his dismissal. Mr Yu, through his privately-held CIM, is a large
investor in media on the mainland and was thought to have powerful friends.
Mr Yu has also resigned from the board of South Sea Development, a property
development and investment company, in which he has a 36 per cent interest.
He stepped down earlier this week from a non-executive directorship at
Tristate, a garment manufacturer.

Grammy Entertainment, the Thai television, radio and music production
company credited with establishing the Thai popular music industry, has
applied for a public flotation. It will be the first entertainment company
listed on the fast-growing Stock Exchange of Thailand.
Grammy executives expect a quarter of the company's 400m shares to be sold
to the public at the initial public offering. Net profit this year is
estimated at about Bt250m (Dollars 10m) on turnover of Bt1.7bn.
Mr Paiboon Damrongchaitham, the founder and executive chairman who owns 72
per cent of the shares, said Grammy needed capital to expand operations in
Asia. 'Globalisation is starting,' he said. 'If I want to join in, we must
have some money to join the business.'
He said Grammy needed the money to invest in its retail network for the
marketing of its Thai music catalogue; to participate in a satellite
television channel and other joint ventures; to pay for new studios and
equipment; and to convert Thai songs into Chinese for big markets in China,
Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Grammy, established in 1983, has become Thailand's leading producer of
television soap operas, game shows and music programmes - it makes 25
programmes a week for the main television stations - as well as the
production company of choice for Thai pop stars.

Gold mines in the Anglo American group, the world's largest gold producer,
announced a 14 per cent increase in earnings to R208.1m (Dollars 58.2m) for
the September quarter, up from R182.1m in June.
The improvement resulted from a higher gold price as average revenue for the
quarter rose 2 per cent to R44,408 a kg from R43,462 a kg, and improved
overall production, which increased 5 per cent to 60,331 kg from 57,683 kg.
This helped offset a 1 per cent increase in working costs, which rose to
R34,139 a kg from R33,923 a kg, largely due to higher wages.
Freegold mine, the group's flagship, turned in a particularly good
performance, lifting production to 25,614 kg from 23,982 kg and raising its
profits to R98.7m from R47.7m.
Western Deep raised output to 10,021 kg from 9,309 kg, while Vaal Reefs
lifted production to 17,861 kg from 16,889 kg. However, Elandsrand was hit
by industrial action and gold output fell to 3,303 kg from 4,193 kg while
profits dropped to R7.1m from R17.8m.
Mr Clem Sunter, chairman of Anglo American's gold and uranium division, said
he was satisfied with the quarter's results and said the gold price would
breach Dollars 400 an ounce during the current quarter on the strength of
increased demand for gold jewellery.

Third-quarter figures from four leading US defence groups showed showed
generally higher margins on static or falling sales. Two of the companies,
McDonnell Douglas and Northrop Grumman, reported increased military aircraft
sales but downturns at their missile operations.
GM Hughes Electronics, the separately-quoted defence and electronics
subsidiary of General Motors, said its defence profits at the operating
level were up 31 per cent at Dollars 168m on sales down 8 per cent at
Dollars 1.36bn.
It attributed the fall in sales to reduced production on various programmes,
including ground radar and Trident missile components, plus termination of
the Advanced Cruise Missile programme and the Follow-On Early Warning
System.
Operating margins rose from 8.8 per cent to 12.4 per cent as a result of
cost reductions, Hughes said.
For the group as a whole, earnings were also helped by a 37 per cent rise in
auto electronics profits and a 110 per cent profits rise in the
telecommunications and space division, offset by a Dollars 52m loss caused
mainly by technical problems with the Hughes-Avicom in-flight entertainment
system.
Net earnings were 61 cents a share against 56 cents.
McDonnell Douglas said underlying earnings were up 39 per cent at a record
Dollars 140m, on sales up only 1 per cent. Operating profit on military
aircraft was also a record at Dollars 182m, up 27 per cent, on sales up 8
per cent. Profits on commercial aircraft, however, were down 27 per cent at
Dollars 8m. Profits in the missiles, space and electronic systems division
were down 51 per cent on a comparable basis at Dollars 56m, on sales down 34
per cent.
Northrop Grumman said sales for the quarter were up 58 per cent to Dollars
1.93bn, or down 6 per cent excluding acquisitions. Operating profits from
aircraft were up 44 per cent at Dollars 121m, while profits in electronics
and systems integration were up 167 per cent at Dollars 40m.
Losses in missiles deepened to Dollars 20m from Dollars 11m, largely due to
increased development costs on the TSSAM missile.
Net income for the group was up 50 per cent at Dollars 39m.
General Dynamics, the nuclear submarine and armoured vehicle maker, reported
a 4 per cent underlying rise in net earnings, to Dollars 54m. Sales were
down 8 per cent to Dollars 714m, and operating margins rose from 8.2 per
cent to 10.8 per cent.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Knocking at the door of
corporate mainland China - Taiwan's Evergreen group is preparing for the
normalisation of trading links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Chang Yung-fa, chairman of Taiwan's Evergreen group, is keen to expand
his shipping, airline and hotel businesses into China. But Taipei's
continued ban on direct transportation across the Taiwan Strait is blocking
his path.
The former sailor founded what is now one of the world's biggest container
shipping lines with a tramp steamer in 1968. In 1991, he established
Taiwan's first private international airline.
Frustrated at being frozen out of China's fast-growing market, he is
pressing the government to resume direct sea and air links, cut in 1949
following the Nationalist defeat in China's civil war.
'The mainland market should be a Chinese market,' he says. 'If we keep going
on like this, how can Taiwan's shipping industry survive? And how will
Taiwan's economy continue to develop?'
Mr Chang's blue-chip flagship, Evergreen Marine (EMC), is popular among
foreign institutional investors. However, foreign ownership restrictions
hold foreign holdings at less than 5 per cent of outstanding shares. EMC
posted net profits of TDollars 1.22bn (USDollars 46.7m) for first six months
to June 30, up 2.4 per cent from a year earlier.
A political stalemate between Taipei and Beijing makes it unlikely -
although not impossible - that the government will lift the cross-strait
shipping ban within a year. Full normalisation of trade ties, including
direct flights, could take several years.
Meanwhile, the Evergreen group is streamlining its operations and making
initial forays into China in preparation for direct links. Only a small
fraction of the group's ocean freight currently originates in China.
In May, the closely-held group announced plans to invest up to USDollars 80m
in China for development of port, terminal and transport systems. Evergreen
Marine has earmarked Dollars 50m for China investments, while listed shipper
Uniglory Marine Corp, 37 per cent-owned by EMC, will invest up to Dollars
30m.
The group's first project is to build an inland container terminal near
Shanghai. EMC will invest USDollars 6m for a 60 per cent stake in Shanghai
Evergreen Container Transportation, a joint venture with a subsidiary of the
Shanghai port authority, which will invest Dollars 4m for a 40 per cent
share. The project, the first by a Taiwanese shipping company on the
mainland, is scheduled for completion by mid-1996.
Evergreen, which has offices in Shanghai and Xiamen, plans to co-operate
with the Xiamen Steamship Company to open a Xiamen-Hong Kong route. Uniglory
is considering terminal development projects in the ports of Xiamen, Tianjin
and Qingdao.
Evergreen is also looking at a joint project with US-based General Electric
to build a container terminal at Zhangjia harbour near Shanghai.
EVA Airways Corp, an important component in the group's diversification
strategy, is poised to become highly profitable once direct flights to China
are permitted, analysts say. But for the moment, the airline remains a drain
on group finances and is unlikely to become profitable before 1996.
Since China's open-door and economic reform policies began to bear fruit in
the early 1980s, growing cross-strait trade has been routed through Hong
Kong or other locations. Once direct shipping is allowed, Uniglory will
serve 'feeder' routes as China's harbours are too shallow for larger ships,
while EMC will ply the long-haul lanes.
To accommodate expected increased business, EMC in June placed orders for
its first five U-type (post-panamax, or too wide for the Panama Canal)
container ships for trans-Pacific routes. Also on order are five more R-type
(panamax) vessels. The group's fleet currently has 75 container vessels.
This will rise to 85 in two to three years.
EVA is expanding its fleet aggressively and expects to have 25 aircraft by
the end of 1995 from 12 at the beginning of this year. Owned 26.5 per cent
by EMC, EVA saw a rise in passengers following government-owned flagship
carrier China Air Lines' tragedy at Japan's Nagoya airport in April, in
which at least 260 people died.
EVA has so far secured rights to fly to nearly 20 destinations and is
especially keen to gain access to the 'golden' Hong Kong-Taiwan route, now
dominated by CAL and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific. The airline is expected
to go public once it makes a profit.
Aviation is one of the industries in China in which the Taiwan government
bans its citizens from investing, but EVA is believed to be quietly
preparing for direct flights to the big Chinese cities.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Matsushita fights for leading
role - MCA's quest for control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita, flew across the Pacific
on Tuesday, the distance between Osaka, where his company is based, and his
Californian destination, must have seemed greater than ever.
The head of the Japanese consumer electronics group made a hastily arranged
trip to San Francisco to find out why the men who run MCA, its US
entertainment subsidiary, had suddenly - and very publicly - demanded
independence from their Japanese owner.
The latest drama in Matsushita's four years as MCA's parent provides a stark
illustration of the difficulties that a conservative company, which values
consensus and long-term thinking, faces in running a business like MCA,
steeped in Hollywood's entrepreneurial and egotistical culture. It also
highlights the problems of MCA's executives in adapting to life under a very
different corporate regime.
It can be no consolation to Mr Morishita that the current crisis was widely
predicted when Matsushita bought MCA, which includes Geffen Records and
Universal Pictures, for Dollars 6.1bn in late 1990, shortly after Sony's
acquisitions of Columbia Pictures and CBS Records.
One investment banker commented that the the Japanese have 'no idea of the
difficulty of managing Hollywood companies with their prima donna culture of
limousines and private jets'.
Hollywood has for months been buzzing with rumours of rifts between MCA and
its parent. Yet Matsushita executives were clearly flabbergasted by last
week's reports that Mr Lew Wasserman, MCA's chairman, and Mr Sidney
Sheinberg, its president, were considering a bid to buy back control of
their business.
Matsushita, to an even greater degree than most Japanese companies, likes to
deal with its problems discreetly. Any sign of weakness from senior
management in the face of pressure from a US subsidiary would have been
perceived as loss of face.
MCA is also a critical component of Matsushita's long-term strategy in the
communications sphere. Without control of MCA's vast libraries of movies and
music - which include Jurassic Park and The Flintstones and chart-topping
albums from Nirvana and Aerosmith - Matsushita would be relegated to the
role of a low-margin hardware manufacturer.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Morishita said 'no' when Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg on
Tuesday asked him to cede managerial control of MCA.
'What else could he have done?' asked Mr Christopher Dixon, entertainment
industry analyst at PaineWebber in New York. 'There's no question that
Matsushita is taking a long-term view of its investment. It's got to stick
with MCA.'
The two companies are now plotting their next moves in a high-stakes game.
The critical question is whether Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg will stay at
MCA, where they have worked together for 22 years as the longest-running
management team in Hollywood.
Both men could easily afford to quit, having made substantial sums by
selling MCA shares to Matsushita. Mr Wasserman, 81, has already offered to
go next year. Mr Sheinberg, 59, may follow when his contract ends in 1995.
He, like his boss, has become increasingly dissatisfied with Matsushita's
refusal to back MCA's expansion plans.
They had hoped their wealthy Japanese parent would finance MCA's
participation in the wave of mergers and acquisitions that has swept the US
as broadcasters, cable TV operators, telecommunications companies and
entertainment groups have raced to position themselves in the interactive
media services market.
The US corporate frenzy has been watched with scepticism from across the
Pacific. Companies like Matsushita, accustomed to the slow, evolutionary
pace of development in consumer electronics, are dubious about the timing of
the multimedia revolution and its financial potential.
These differences came to a head when Matsushita blocked MCA's recent
attempt to acquire 49 per cent of NBC, the US television company. This,
coupled with a previous decision to veto the proposed purchase of Virgin
Records, fuelled MCA's fears of being left behind by dynamic rivals such as
Time Warner and Viacom.
Whatever Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg decide to do, Matsushita must address
the issue of MCA's long-term strategy. Its efforts to do so will be
constrained by its ongoing rationalisation programme in Japan, given that it
will be reluctant to risk alienating its domestic workforce by sanctioning
aggressive expansion in the US.
MCA itself is in a vulnerable condition. Its performance was erratic in its
first few years under Matsushita. However, it produced record results in
1993 (when analysts suspect it made operating profits of up to Dollars 400m
on revenues of Dollars 4bn) thanks to the success of Geffen's music
releases, Jurassic Park and The Flintstones. This year's results are
expected to be rather less robust.
Moreover, Mr David Geffen, founder of Geffen Records, will leave MCA when
his contract expires in April. He may well be followed by Mr Steven
Spielberg, director of Jurassic Park and producer of The Flintstones, who
last week announced he was launching an entertainment group with Mr Geffen
and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, former head of Walt Disney's movie studio.
Their departure would deprive MCA of two of its most prolific - and
profitable - talents at a time when it desperately needs successful new
concepts.
'No-one is ever irreplaceable,' said one analyst. 'But those two will be
very tough acts to follow.'
Mr Spielberg is an old friend of Mr Sheinberg. The latter had hoped the new
group might be persuaded to join forces with MCA if he and Mr Wasserman
could persuade the Japanese to cede control.
Instead, Matsushita's refusal has left MCA in turmoil.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Global growth lifts drugs groups
 -Consumer products sales help Warner-Lambert, AHP to higher earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Strong sales of consumer healthcare products supported third-quarter
earnings at both Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, the US
pharmaceuticals and healthcare companies.
Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman and chief executive of Warner-Lambert, which
derives two-thirds of its sales from consumer products, said worldwide
growth accounted for a 20 per cent increase in sales from a year before, to
Dollars 1.13bn.
This was partly due to a joint venture with Wellcome, under which
Warner-Lambert markets some of the UK company's products in the US.
AHP, which is in the process of completing its acquisition of American
Cyanamid, reported a 14 per cent increase (13 per cent without exchange
adjustments) in non-US consumer product sales.
Overall, such products, which account for just over a quarter of the group's
total healthcare sales, recorded 6 per cent growth. AHP's bigger
pharmaceuticals business also reported a 6 per cent advance in sales, to
Dollars 1.3bn, driven by a 14 per cent jump in revenues outside the US.
Demand for infant nutritional products and the company's contraceptives
accounted for the growth.
This was balanced by growth of only 2 per cent in US drugs sales (4 per cent
excluding the Agri-Bio business, which was sold earlier this year).
Warner-Lambert's drug sales, meanwhile, rose just Dollars 2m from a year
before, to Dollars 534m. Sales in the US of Lopid, the company's lipid
regulator, slipped on competition from generic drug makers, resulting in a 1
per cent overall fall in US sales, to Dollars 274m.
Warner-Lambert's net income for the period rose 8.5 per cent to Dollars
169.2m, or Dollars 1.26 a share, on overall sales up 13 per cent at Dollars
1.67bn.
AHP's after-tax profits were 4 per cent higher, at Dollars 413m, or Dollars
1.35 a share, on sales of Dollars 2.26bn, also 4 per cent higher than the
1993 quarter.

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the leading US telecommunications group, yesterday said revenues
jumped by a record 8.3 per cent in the third quarter but its net income was
virtually static.
These were the first results to reflect AT&amp;T's recently completed merger
with McCaw Cellular Communications.
Although the deal in effect depressed short-term profitability, it also
opened up a new source of revenue for the group by giving it a solid
presence in the growing market for wireless communications.
Net income for the enlarged group was Dollars 1.05bn, or 67 cents a share,
compared with re-stated profits of Dollars 1.02bn, or 66 cents, for the same
period of 1993. About 10 per cent, or 9 cents a share, was sliced off the
combined earnings by the dilutive effect of 200m new shares issued by AT&amp;T
as part of the merger deal. Associated expenses reduced profits by a further
11 cents, or Dollars 170m.
AT&amp;T's underlying performance was robust. Without the merger, net income
would have shown a solid 13 per cent increase to Dollars 1.19bn, or 87 cents
a share, against Dollars 1.05bn, or 78 cents, a year earlier.
Stripping out the McCaw contribution, revenues were still strong, up nearly
8 per cent at Dollars 18bn. Wall Street had expected slightly lower figures.
'No matter how you look at the numbers, they add up to a very good quarter
from operations,' said Mr Robert Allen, the chairman.
However, the good results failed to have much impact on AT&amp;T's share price,
which was up a scant Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 54 1/4 .
For the first nine months of the year, consolidated net income was Dollars
3.37bn, or Dollars 2.16 a share, on revenues of Dollars 53.9bn.
Restating the year-earlier figures, the company would have reported a net
loss of Dollars 5.5bn, on sales of Dollars 50.2bn.

<TEXT>
DDI, a Japanese long-distance telecommunications operator, is planning a
rights issue of around Y50bn (Dollars 514m) next month, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The issue will be the largest rights issue at market price since the
Ministry of Finance lifted its ban at the end of last year. The ministry had
restricted market-price public offerings since the market crashed in 1990.
The company said it may offer around 60,000 new shares. Although the move
will come after next week's listing of Japan Tobacco, analysts said the
issue was unlikely to cause over-supply worries among stock market investors
due to the small amount of funds involved.
DDI plans to use the funds to invest in its personal hand-phone operations
which are due to start next spring.

John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group, has foreshadowed a
potential move into electronic and digital technology with a possible
investment of up to ADollars 1bn (Dollars 740m) later this decade, writes
Bruce Jacques in Sydney. Mr Stephen Mulholland, chief executive, yesterday
told a Securities Institute of Australia lunch the company was negotiating a
pay television deal which would involve equity of ADollars 10m-ADollars 12m
and borrowings of a similar amount.
But the company would be prepared to make an investment of up to ADollars
1bn in the information technology area, either in Australia or overseas,
after 1997 when its debt-to-equity ratio was expected to be below 20 per
cent.
Mr Mulholland reiterated that Fairfax was negotiating a plan to link with a
leading, but unnamed, US database provider. The company was also planning to
launch a Saturday edition of the Australian Financial Review early next
year.

<TEXT>
Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, posted modest growth in
the three months to September with a 6 per cent increase in net income to
Dollars 151m, writes Richard Tomkins. As in the second quarter, the bright
spot was the growth in overseas sales, particularly in emerging markets. The
biggest drag on profits was the continued downturn in North American sales,
attributed to reductions in retail inventories.
Group revenues, boosted by growth in emerging markets, rose by 6 per cent to
Dollars 1.9bn. Operating profits were 13 per cent ahead at Dollars 255.7m,
but net income was hit by a big increase in the interest charge.
Earnings per share, boosted by extensive company share repurchases, rose by
12 per cent to Dollars 1.00.

Exide, the US maker of automotive batteries, is set to become Europe's
biggest car battery maker with the acquisition of a Fiat subsidiary for
Dollars 535m, writes Richard Waters.
The Michigan-based company said it had signed a letter of intent to buy Cia

Dollars 700m, Ceac is the current European market leader. It operates mainly
in France, Italy and Germany.
The deal is the third attempt by Exide to break into the European market in
recent months. In July it agreed to pay around Dollars 250m for Tudor, a
Spanish battery maker. Before that, it paid around Dollars 30m for Big
Batteries, a privately-owned Welsh company.
Exide said it would finance a 'significant' portion of the bid with equity,
and that it would borrow from banks and raise sub-ordinated debt for the
rest.

advance

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Northwest Airlines yesterday reinforced the picture of recovery among the
big US carriers by reporting its highest-ever quarterly profits for the
three months to September.
Northwest said net income jumped from Dollars 110.7m to Dollars 170m in the
third quarter, its fifth consecutive profitable quarter.
The size of the increase echoed the figures reported a day earlier by
American Airlines, which increased net profits to Dollars 188m from Dollars
102m.
Northwest said revenues rose 6.5 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn and operating
profits rose 34 per cent to Dollars 359.2m. Earnings per share, fully
diluted, were up 19 per cent at Dollars 1.73.
Like American, Northwest has been responding to competition from smaller,
low-cost carriers in the US by cutting unprofitable routes and increasing
productivity in its remaining operations. It has also benefited from lower
fuel prices and economic growth.
Last year Northwest won a substantial reduction in its costs by reaching a
deal with its workforce in which it swapped a 27.4 per cent stake in the
company for wage cuts and other labour concessions worth Dollars 886m over
39 months.
The airline has also suffered less badly from low-cost competition than some
other big carriers. Many of the areas Northwest serves are less densely
populated and are therefore less suitable for the high-frequency, short-haul
shuttle services that low-cost operators offer.
Southwest Airlines, the biggest of the low-cost US carriers, continued its
strong profits growth with a 20 per cent increase in net income to Dollars
58.6m in the third quarter.

<TEXT>
Bankers Trust reported a 45 per cent drop in third-quarter profits to
Dollars 169m yesterday, but management of the New York banking group
expressed satisfaction at the performance in what it described as a
difficult business environment.
The bank said its client financial risk management and propriety trading
businesses had performed especially well. This is indicates that the
problems Bankers Trust encountered earlier in the year in selling
derivatives products and in trading its own money have partially eased.
The profits are equivalent to Dollars 1.98 a share, compared with Dollars
3.60 in the same quarter of 1993. Net revenues were Dollars 542m, down from
Dollars 773m a year ago, when results were boosted by record revenues from
trading activities.
Return on equity in the latest quarter was 15 per cent, a respectable figure
among banks of its type.
However, investors had hoped Bankers Trust would match analysts' earnings
per share estimates of about Dollars 2.15, and the shares closed down
Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 65 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Although trading revenues of Dollars 278m were down from last year's record
Dollars 431m, they were stronger than analysts had expected.
Net interest revenues, however, came in well below forecasts at Dollars
264m.
An increase in assets under management helped lift fiduciary and fund
management revenues slightly, to Dollars 188m, but fees and commissions
slipped 18 per cent to Dollars 163m due to the slowdown in corporate finance
activity.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Four US regional telephone companies are to form a partnership in cellular
telephones across the US, with almost 4m customers. The partners - Bell
Atlantic, Nynex, US West and AirTouch - will also bid jointly for personal
communication service (PCS) licences being auctioned off later this year by
the US government.
Bell Atlantic and Nynex, which serve most of the US eastern seaboard, had
already agreed to merge their cellular interests. Separately, so had US West
and AirTouch, which cover the West Coast. The new arrangement would not be a
merger, the partners said. However, it would launch a nationally branded
cellular service, possibly in combination with a long-distance phone company
as a further partner.
Referring to rumours that the Bell Atlantic/Nynex consortium had previously
been trying to do a deal with MCI, the second largest US long distance
company, the partners denied that their agreement represented a second best
option. The US telephone industry has been involved in a strenuous search
for partners since the recently completed merger of AT&amp;T with McCaw, which
puts together America's biggest long-distance company and biggest cellular
company.
'Everybody has been talking to everybody, and we are still talking,' one of
the partners said yesterday. 'But we feel we have the critical mass to go
alone if necessary.'
One of the attractions of merging with a long-distance partner, industry
observers said, was that only long-distance telephone companies such as AT&amp;T
or MCI had a nationally recognised brand name.
The partners said the new entity, provisionally known as Tomco, would bid
for PCS licences on the basis of filling in geographic areas where the
partners were not represented.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Broking unit pushes Salomon into
the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon yesterday announced a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 104m, or
Dollars 1.13 a share, following another poor performance from its Wall
Street securities broking unit, Salomon Brothers.
In the same quarter a year ago, the group earned a profit of Dollars 20m, or
Dollars 0.01. Salomon warned two weeks ago it would report a big quarterly
loss.
For the second consecutive quarter, the damage was inflicted by Salomon
Brothers, which incurred a pre-tax loss of Dollars 176m. This compared with
a modest profit of Dollars 19m in the same quarter a year ago, and took
total losses for the first nine months of 1994 to Dollars 547m.
The rest of the US securities industry has seen earnings decline this year
after the sharp deterioration in trading and underwriting conditions on Wall
Street. But Salomon Brothers has suffered more than most, mainly because a
large part of its business involves risking its capital in the global
financial markets.
In the last quarter, the firm is believed to have been hit by losses on its
mortgage-backed securities positions, which it has now shrunk to minimise
the potential for more trouble.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Earthquake losses continue to
shake Sears, Roebuck results

January's California earth-quake again shook Sears, Roebuck's bottom line in
the third quarter, with additional catastrophe losses announced by its
Allstate insurance subsidiary in September reducing the US retailer's net
income by Dollars 182.4m.
Allstate yesterday reported its quake-related losses had reached Dollars
845m for the first nine months of the year, with Sears' share of those
losses at Dollars 677.1m.
Income growth at Sears' merchandising division helped offset the insurance
losses, with Sears reporting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 363.5m, or 91
cents a share, down from Dollars 388.4m, or 98 cents, in last year's third
quarter.
Sales for the quarter were up about 3.8 per cent, to Dollars 13.2bn, from
last year's Dollars 12.7bn.
Sears' Merchandise Group recorded third-quarter net income of Dollars 196m,
up from Dollars 159m last year, while sales rose to Dollars 7.7bn from
Dollars 7.3bn last time.
'Our core retailing and insurance businesses continued to post very good
operating performances in the quarter, highlighted by the Mer-chandise
Group's earnings in-crease of about 24 per cent and Allstate's significantly
improv-ed underwriting performance excluding the impact of the earthquake,'
said Mr Edward Brennan, Sears chairman.
'The fundamentals of our Sears and Allstate businesses are very sound,' he
added.
For the first nine months net income was Dollars 769.0m, or Dollars 1.92 a
share, on revenues of Dollars 38.48bn. In the same 1993 period Sears had
income of Dollars 1.83bn, or Dollars 4.73, which included a Dollars 635.1m
gain from Allstate's share offering. Sears' revenues in the period last year
were Dollars 36.17bn.
Allstate, 80.1 per cent owned by Sears, separately reported its
third-quarter income at Dollars 193.9m, or 43 cents, down sharply from
Dollars 325.7m, or 72 cents, last time.
The company said losses from the California earthquake reduced third-quarter
earnings by 51 cents a share. Allstate's third-quarter revenues were Dollars
5.39bn, up from Dollars 5.32bn.
For the nine months Allstate's income was Dollars 320.7m, or 71 cents,
against Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars 2.42. Sales for the period were Dollars
16.03bn, up from Dollars 15.66bn.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: ITT may sell off its Sheraton
franchises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of further asset sales by ITT was raised yesterday by Mr Rand
Araskog, chairman of the US conglomerate, which reported virtually flat net
income in the latest quarter.
Mr Araskog said the most likely candidate for sale or a spin-off was the
Sheraton hotels franchising business.
Of the 270 Sheraton establishments in North America, 207 are franchised
rather than owned by the company.
In total, hotels accounted for Dollars 18m of the group's operating net
income in the latest quarter, and Dollars 913m of sales.
ITT is selling its financial services businesses, other than insurance, in
part to help finance the purchase of Viacom's Madison Square Garden
business. ITT is undertaking the Dollars 1.1bn deal in association with
Cablevision, a cable-TV operator.
The group has come under pressure from shareholders to dispose of various
operations which could be worth more as stand-alone businesses.
The group's ongoing businesses as a whole recorded operating income of
Dollars 399m, up 22 per cent from a year before.
Net income as a whole was Dollars 257m, Dollars 5m higher than in the 1993
quarter on sales up 10 per cent at Dollars 5.67bn. Earnings per share rose 5
per cent, to Dollars 2.01.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T flat despite record rise in
revenue following McCaw merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT&amp;T, the leading US telecommunications group, yesterday said revenues
jumped by a record 8.3 per cent in the third quarter but its net income was
virtually static.
These were the first results to reflect AT&amp;T's recently completed merger
with McCaw Cellular Communications.
Although the deal in effect depressed short-term profitability, it also
opened up an important new source of revenue for the group by giving it a
solid presence in the growing market for wireless communications.
Net income for the enlarged group was Dollars 1.05bn, or 67 cents a share,
compared with restated profits of Dollars 1.02bn, or 66 cents, for the same
period of 1993.
About 10 per cent, or 9 cents a share, was sliced off the combined earnings
by the dilutive effect of 200m new shares issued by AT&amp;T as part of the
merger deal. Associated expenses reduced profits by a further 11 cents, or
Dollars 170m.
AT&amp;T's underlying perform-ance was robust. Without the merger, net income
would have shown a solid 13 per cent increase to Dollars 1.19bn, or 87 cents
a share, against Dollars 1.05bn, or 78 cents, a year earlier.
Stripping out the McCaw contribution, revenues were still strong, up nearly
8 per cent at Dollars 18bn. Wall Street had expected slightly lower figures.
'No matter how you look at the numbers, they add up to a very good quarter
from operations,' said Mr Robert Allen, chairman.
The improvement was evident across the board. Long-distance calling volumes
climbed more than 7 per cent, due in part to the success of consumer
incentive programmes. Gross profit margin showed a gain, too, helping to
lift telecom-munications revenues by 3.5 per cent to nearly Dollars 11bn.
McCaw Cellular generated total revenues of Dollars 735m, against Dollars
563m in the 1993 quarter. Its subscription base grew to 3.6m.
Sales of products - including network equipment, computer systems and
microelectronic components and others - surged by 20 per cent to Dollars
5.07bn.
However, the good results failed to have much impact on AT&amp;T's share price,
which was up a scant Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 54 3/8 in early trading.
For the first nine months of the year, consolidated net income was Dollars
3.37bn, or Dollars 2.16 a share, on revenues of Dollars 53.9bn.
Restating the year-earlier figures, the company would have reported a net
loss of Dollars 5.5bn, on sales of Dollars 50.2bn.

Sentrachem, the South African chemicals producer, turned in a solid
performance for the year to August, raising net income 43 per cent to R159m
(Dollars 45.3m) from R111m a year ago, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg.
Turnover increased by 7 per cent to R2.8bn from R2.62bn, reflecting improved
sales from most divisions, although troubled Mega Plastics remained under
pressure.
Operating income rose 16 per cent to R248m from R214m while finance charges
dropped to R55m from R66m, largely as a result of a successful R289m rights
issue in February. The dividend was increased 17 per cent to 28 cents from
24 cents.
The group said that given the upturn in international chemical prices and
the improvement in the commodity cycle, it expected earnings for the next
financial year to improve significantly.
It also noted that its reduced net borrowings of R147m, just 12 per cent of
equity, left it in a strong position to take advantage of new projects or
acquisitions.

<TEXT>
Krung Thai Bank, one of Thailand's largest banks, yesterday announced a 75
per cent rise in net profit to Bt2.36bn (Dollars 94.7m) in the third quarter
from Bt1.35bn in the same period last year. For the first nine months, net
profit was up 56 per cent to Bt6.16bn, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok.
Thailand's banks, which have long enjoyed wide spreads between their lending
and deposit rates, are in an exceptionally strong position because the
central bank is attempting to curb inflation and is reluctant to allow
lending rates to fall.
Last week, Thai Farmers Bank said its third-quarter net profit rose 64 per
cent to Bt2.74bn, up from Bt1.67bn a year earlier. Other banks are also
expected to announce improved results. Stock market analysts believe the
banking sector as a whole will increase net profit by more than 30 per cent
this year.
Krung Thai Bank also announced it would raise up to Bt3bn with an issue of
long-term, unsecured debentures, and would raise its stakes in affiliated
computer service and insurance companies.

<TEXT>
Strong growth in emerging markets helped Coca-Cola, the US soft drinks
company, report a 23 per cent increase in net profits to Dollars 708m in its
third quarter - its biggest percentage increase in quarterly earnings in
four years.
The company had indicated last month that its figures would be better than
usual when it announced that its estimates of volumes sold during the
quarter were significantly ahead of analysts' expectations.
Yesterday it said that volume growth had been led by a 17 per cent surge in
international unit case volume, 3 percentage points higher than it had
predicted last month. US volume growth was 6 per cent, as expected,
producing an average worldwide increase of 13 per cent.
Sales revenue grew by 23 per cent to Dollars 4.5bn, reflecting the increased
volumes, strategic price increases and favourable exchange rate movements.
Earnings per share, boosted by company share repurchases, rose by 25 per
cent to 55 cents.
The fastest areas of growth came in new and emerging markets such as eastern
and central Europe, the Middle East, India and China. The company's
north-east Europe/Middle East group increased volumes by 43 per cent.
Volumes in Japan and Europe recovered from a poor third quarter last year,
rising 26 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. In the UK, volumes rose 21
per cent.

<TEXT>
Generale des Eaux, the French utilities and communications group, yesterday
posted net profits of FFr1.26bn (Dollars 245m) for the first half of 1994,
an increase of 5.4 per cent over the same period last year.
The improvement was achieved on sales of FFr72.8bn, a rise of 2.9 per cent.
The group said sales for the full year should rise by about 4 per cent above
the FFr154bn recorded in 1993. Profits are expected to increase by a similar
proportion.
The strongest growth in sales during the first half came from foreign
markets. Turnover outside France rose by 13.1 per cent to FFr20.8bn,
reflecting strong demand for the company's core utilities activities.
The company said that activity in the French property sector remained weak,
claiming that 'the small number of new projects weighed heavily on
turnover'. Losses at Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, the group's property
division, prompted a fall of 23.8 per cent in operating profits to FFr1.8bn.
Generale des Eaux said it continued to invest heavily in its
telecommunications activities. These include its Cofira-SFR subsidiary, one
of the two mobile telephone networks currently operating in France.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Rockwell bids Dollars 1.5bn in
battle for Reliance Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A bid battle has broken out over the US industrial motor company Reliance
Electric with a Dollars 1.5bn cash offer from Rockwell International. In
August, Reliance agreed to be taken over in a Dollars 1.3bn all-share deal
by General Signal.
Rockwell, which makes industrial controls as well as rockets and missiles,
is much the bigger of the two bidders, with sales last year of Dollars
10.8bn. General Signal, which also makes industrial controls, had sales of
Dollars 1.5bn, around the same size as Reliance. Rockwell plans to merge
Reliance with its Allen-Bradley controls division, to create an industrial
automation business with world sales of about Dollars 3.5bn.
Mr Donald Beall, chairman, said the deal would lead to higher volume and
reduced costs. 'The strategic logic is driven by serving our customers
better and improving our global position, not by cost-cutting', he said.
Rockwell said it would sell Reliance's telecommunications business, which
contributed just under a third of its sales last year. Before the disposal,
the purchase would raise Rockwell's net debt from 17 per cent of capital
employed to the low 40s. 'That's not an issue for Rockwell,' Mr Beall said.
'We have a very strong balance sheet and cash flow.'
Neither General Signal nor Reliance, which described the offer as 'a
complete surprise', made an initial response. Wall Street's immediate
reaction was to mark Reliance shares up Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 29 3/4 ,
just short of Rockwell's Dollars 30 a share offer. General Signal's shares,
which had been depressed by the prospect of a heavy equity issue, rose
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 35 3/8  .
One analyst said 'Rockwell has deep pockets, and it's a very logical fit.'
In Europe, Allen-Bradley is one of the best-known names in factory
automation. It has four European manufacturing plants - at Milton Keynes in
the UK, Ivrea and Milan in Italy, and Aarau in Switzerland - and employs
more than 1,000 people. The Swiss plant came with last year's purchase by
Rockwell of Sprecher + Schuh's low-voltage electro-mechanical controls
business and the Sprecher + Schuh name and trademark.
Sales figures for Allen-Bradley Europe were not available, but the UK is by
far its largest European market. It is the UK market leader for programmable
logic controls (PLCs), widely used to control motors in machinery. In 1992,
Allen-Bradley acquired all the assets of Osai A-B, a joint venture in
computerised numerical control equipment, by buying out the interest of its
partner, a subsidiary of Olivetti.
Shortly after the offer was announced, Reliance issued its third-quarter
results, showing net earnings for the quarter more than doubled at Dollars
21m on sales up 12 per cent at Dollars 449m.
Reliance's biggest shareholder is Citicorp, the US bank, which holds 5.25m
non-voting shares convertible into 28 per cent of the equity. Rockwell said
Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, had received a courtesy call just before
the announcement of the offer. Citicorp was not available for comment.
Mr Beall said Rockwell had expressed interest in acquiring Reliance in July.
'We were surprised and disappointed that Rockwell was not afforded an
opportunity to further pursue these discussions,' he said. Mr Beall said the
delay in making a counter-offer was due to lack of information from
Reliance.
'We have done a very thorough strategic and financial review from publicly
available information', he said. The deal would be 'accretive to our
financial results, though probably flat in year one'.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Outsider named US Prudential
chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Prudential Insurance, the US's biggest retail financial services group,
yesterday named an outsider as chairman and chief executive for the first
time in its 119-year history.
The company said Mr Arthur Ryan, currently the number two at Chase
Manhattan, would take over when Mr Robert Winters, 62, retires on December
1.
The appointment of an outsider highlights the Prudential's expansion into
mutual funds, lending and other financial services beyond its core life
insurance business. In areas such as credit cards and mortgage lending, the
Prudential is in direct competition with banking groups such as Chase.
Mr Ryan faces the immediate task of retouching Prudential's tarnished
reputation, which has been sullied by a scandal at Prudential Securities,
its broking arm.
Last year, Prudential Securities agreed to pay up to Dollars 371m in fines
and restitution to settle charges that it defrauded hundreds of thousands of
investors in the early 1980s by selling them Dollars 8bn of high-risk
limited partnerships.
Although it wasn't directly involved in the scandal, the strength of the
Prudential Insurance name helped to bring investors into the partnerships.
Mr Winters, an actuary by training, had indicated that he would retire early
ever since becoming chairman six years ago, the Prudential said. It added
that the board had picked an outsider because 'he was the best man for the
job'.
Mr Ryan, 52, a banker with a reputation for toughness and strong operating
skills, will face a very different culture at Prudential.
The group, which is based in Newark, New Jersey, is a mutual institution,
owned by its 50m policyholders, with an approach to business sometimes
described as 'Prudential polite'. It employs more than 100,000 people and
had revenues of Dollars 45bn last year.
The new chairman said the Prudential would be 'a tough, focused competitor
with the highest standard of business ethics'.
He said that he would start by 'working intensively' to understand its
operations.
Mr Ryan and Mr Thomas Labrecque, Chase's chairman, have presided over a
strong recovery at the New York banking group. The group's cumbersome
structure was streamlined, with all line units around the world reporting to
Mr Ryan.
However, Mr Ryan's chances of taking over as chairman were thought to be
limited because the two men are only four years apart in age.
Mr Labrecque said last night that the relatively small gap between the men's
ages had 'undoubtedly been part of the issue for Art'. He said it meant that
'at some point it was inevitable' that Mr Ryan would seek the helm of
another company.
Chase said yesterday that it did not intend to name a replacement for Mr
Ryan, and was instead promoting the three executive vice-presidents
responsible for its main divisions to work directly under Mr Labrecque.

<TEXT>
Kaufhof Holding, the German retailer, and Horten, Germany's fourth-biggest
department store group, are proposing to merge their retail operations
within the Kaufhof group, a joint statement said yesterday, agencies report.
The proposal reflects Kaufhof's determination to push through
rationalisation in the depressed department store sector. Kaufhof took a
majority stake in Horten this summer and is offering to buy out the 41 per
cent of Horten's shares it does not already own.
Horten shareholders are being offered DM200 a share, which values the
company at about DM1bn (Dollars 666m).

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux gains 5.4%

<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Generale des Eaux the French utilities and communications group, yesterday
posted net profits of FFr1.26bn (Dollars 245m) for the first half of 1994,
an increase of 5.4 per cent over the same period last year.
The improvement was achieved on sales of FFr72.8bn, a rise of 2.9 per cent.
According to the group, sales for the full year should rise by about 4 per
cent above the FFr154bn recorded in 1993. Profits are expected to increase
by a similar proportion, the company forecast.
The strongest growth in sales during the first half came from foreign
markets. Turnover outside France rose by 13.1 per cent to FFr20.8bn,
reflecting strong demand for the company's core utilities activities.
The company said that activity in the French property sector remained weak,
claiming that 'the small number of new projects weighed heavily on
turnover.' Losses at Compagnie Immobiliere Phenix, the group's property
division, prompted a fall of 23.8 per cent in operating profits to FFr1.8bn.
Generale des Eaux said it continued to invest heavily in its
telecommunications activities. These include its Cofira-SFR subsidiary, one
of the two mobile telephone networks currently operating in France.
Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, the French life insurance company scheduled
for privatisation by the end of this year, yesterday predicted it would
generate full-year profits of FFr1.4bn, writes Andrew Jack in Paris.
It said negotiations that had reopened with the French post office, over the
continued sale of its products, would be completed by the end of November.
For the first six months CNP's profits rose 15 per cent to FFr692m, CNP
said.
The developments are likely to have an important effect on details of the
pricing of the shares in the privatisation.
About FFr17bn of its FFr33bn in sales of life assurance to individuals came
through the post office, where CNP has enjoyed nearly all of the sales of
policies.

Leif Hoegh, the Norwegian shipowner, reported a sharp fall in nine-month
pre-tax profit, to NKr136m (Dollars 20.8m) from NKr581m, and cut its
forecast for 1994 net profits by NKr50m to NKr200m.
It blamed the weaker result on reduced capacity and lower earnings by car
carriers and liner vessels; high operating costs; lost time due to
dry-docking; unrealised losses in the bond portfolio; and bigger than
anticipated losses by its Cool Carriers unit.
Group freight revenue rose to NKr2.14bn from NKr1.79bn, but higher voyage
and charter-hire costs cut operating profit, before depreciation, to NKr248m
from NKr463m.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Stet sale reopens advisers
debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government is in the final stages of choosing advisers and
global co-ordinators for the long-awaited privatisation of Stet, the
state-controlled telecommunications holding company.
The importance of the decision - this will be one of the biggest Italian
sell-offs - has reignited a simmering debate about the dominance of
non-Italian investment banks, which have picked up most of the advisory work
since the Italian privatisation programme got under way last year.
IRI, the state holding company which owns 65 per cent of Stet, has sent its
recommendations on advisers to the Italian Treasury's special privatisation
committee, which is completing its analysis of the report. A final decision
will be made, probably before the end of this month, by the Treasury, budget
and industry ministers.
The Italian press has identified Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, as
the front runner to lead the sale. Morgan Stanley, which has declined to
comment on the rumour, was Stet's choice when the previous Italian
government was looking for advisers last year. It is not yet clear whether
the bank wants to be financial adviser on the sale or global co-ordinator,
which involves taking greater financial responsibility for the success of
the offer in Italy and abroad.
On Wednesday, one of the ministers responsible for the offer - Mr Giancarlo
Pagliarini, who holds the budget dossier - said he hoped Italian merchant
banks would be given part of the mandate for the Stet sale, which should
take place in the first half of next year. 'We have to give more visibility
to small Italian merchant banks, and there are many of them,' he added. 'We
need to encourage the growth of 10 or more Mediobancas.'
Mediobanca, which specialises in long-term corporate lending, has been the
dominant, indeed almost the only force in Italian merchant banking since the
war, a position it has built up by cultivating close links with Italy's
largest companies, such as Fiat and Pirelli.
But Mediobanca has been awarded only one mandate: it will act as joint
global co-ordinator with Merrill Lynch, for the forthcoming privatisation of
Enel, the state-owned electricity company. IRI and the last Italian
government, headed by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, avoided giving Mediobanca the
mandate for any of the other state sales, in particular because of fears
that it would be unhealthy if Mediobanca increased its influence over
Credito Italiano, IMI, and Banca Commerciale Italiana, the state-controlled
banks.
By contrast, IMI, the nearest Italy has to a rival home-grown merchant bank,
has acted as joint global co-ordinator on two issues - its own privatisation
in January, and that of Ina, the state-owned insurer.
Certain members of the six-month-old centre-right government have given this
debate a dubious political tone by implying that it is unpatriotic to select
mainly big foreign banks for high-prestige privatisation work.
The difficulty is that few other Italian banks rival Mediobanca or the
international investment banks for competence, capital backing and sheer
political clout. However, smaller Italian investment houses say there is
room to give them certain mandates.
For example, although there are normally two global co-ordinators for a big
issue - one foreign and one Italian - foreign banks have been given the
roles of valuer and financial adviser in all the big public privatisation
offers so far. Mr Alberto Albertini, managing director of the Milan-based
investment house of the same name, said yesterday: 'For the valuation part
it isn't size that counts but professionalism.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: BBV falls 7.5% after losses in
bond market
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), the Spanish retail bank, posted a 7.5 per cent
fall to Pta57.7bn (Dollars 461.8m) in third-quarter pre-tax profits after
heavy trading losses at its treasury department. This compared with Pta62bn
for the same period last year.
BBV reported losses of Pta20bn in financial operations, mainly linked to the
volatile bond market, for the nine-month period. Over the same period last
year the bank posted profits of Pta29.8bn from financial operations. The
bank also reported losses of Pta7.7bn on restructuring its security
portfolio against income last year of Pta6.4bn.
The cost of BBV's trading business was partially offset by a 3.9 per cent
rise to Pta252.8bn in the bank's net interest margin and by 17.6 per cent
rise to Pta83.6bn in fees from commissions, most of which were related to
investment funds managed by BBV.
Slightly lower costs allowed the bank to lift its operating profit by 21 per
cent to Pta137bn. BBV said this pointed to the 'excellent performance' of
its pure banking business. BBV said it expected a moderate improvement in
its year-end results.
Banco Popular, the tightly-managed Spanish bank that has been the most
profitable in the domestic sector, lifted third-quarter net-profits 0.9 per
cent to Pta41.1bn in spite of a 3.4 per cent fall to Pta83.2bn in operating
profit.

FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: SCA signals steep price rises
for newsprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCA, one of Europe's largest paper companies, yesterday announced a 25 per
cent increase in continental European newsprint prices, and a 15 per cent
rise in the UK market. The changes will take effect from the end of this
year.
The company signalled the price rise as it embarks upon annual contract
negotiations with big newspaper proprietors over supplies. It said it was
determined to force through increases in the face of some resistance from
the large buyers.
'We've cut the prices by so much over the past couple of years - these
companies must realise we've got to raise prices as demand goes up,' said Mr
Ulf Frolander, SCA's graphic paper managing director.
He said intense competition had led to price discounts of DM40 (Dollars
26.60) a tonne since the end of 1992; the latest increase will recover about
DM20 a tonne.
However, big British newspaper publishers, which buy 75 per cent of UK
supplies, are likely to use their market clout to resist large price rises.
'It is unlikely the big publishers will pay those rises this year - they are
not expecting a hike of more than 7 per cent,' said Mr Tim Rothwell, paper
and packaging analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the London stockbrokers.
Newsprint producers are trying to recover rising costs after the doubling of
prices for virgin pulp this year. Waste paper costs have tripled. At the
same time, demand has finally caught up with the availability of newsprint
after many years of over-supply.
SCA says it has seen a 6 per cent increase in European newsprint demand this
year. Mr Rothwell points to a rise in UK consumption of 14 per cent in the
first half of the year. Nordic companies Norske Skog and Stora earlier
announced newsprint price rises of 15 to 20 per cent and other large
producers are expected to follow suit.

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Chesterfield Props 37% lower at Pounds 4.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chesterfield Properties reported a 37 per cent fall in first-half pre-tax
profits to Pounds 4.91m, compared with Pounds 7.81m which was boosted by
Pounds 3.38m in property disposals. Profits from continuing operations were
ahead 11 per cent.
Mr David Kiernan, finance director, said that the group had benefited from
the firm retail market which had underpinned a recovery in rental values.
However, office rents remained under pressure. About two thirds of revenue
comes from retail operations and Mr Kiernan added: 'We are looking to
increase our retail portfolio to take advantage of the upturn.'
Developments under way would show their benefit to the bottom line 'within
the next two years,' according to Mr Kiernan. However, the immediate outlook
was 'fairly quiet', he added. Refurbishments were progressing on shopping
centres in Hull and Rugby. An office block in Victoria was also due to
receive similar treatment.
Rental income showed a 13 per cent rise to Pounds 5.21m (Pounds 4.62m).
However, income from the group's theatres - including seven in London's West
End - and cinemas declined sharply, increasing losses from Pounds 184,000 to
Pounds 361,000. Mr Kiernan blamed a combination of factors for the
deterioration, including the rail strike, new parking restrictions and a
lack of consumer confidence.
Group turnover also showed a fall, slipping 5 per cent to Pounds 16.5m
(Pounds 17.3m). Earnings per share fell from 20.3p to 11.9p. The interim
dividend is raised to 4.4p (4p).

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: US input helps lift Ferguson 15% to Pounds
6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Growth in all three divisions enabled Ferguson International Holdings, the
labels, hangers and communications components group, to report a 15 per cent
profits increase in the six months to August 31.
The shares rose 23p to 331p.
Pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 6.01m (Pounds 5.24m) on turnover ahead 23
per cent to Pounds 80.5m (Pounds 65.6m). The figures benefited from the
first full contribution from Red Wing, the US hangers business bought in
September 1993 for Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.1m).
Since the period-end Ferguson has bought Elswick, a rival UK labels
supplier, for Pounds 37.7m in cash and shares.
Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, said that before the acquisition, Ferguson was
number one in textiles labels; with Elswick that position was more firmly
established and the group was now also number one in food labels.
Since his arrival in 1990, Mr Cassidy has - via disposals - shifted Ferguson
from a mini-conglomerate to a group with three core activities.
He said yesterday that in the first half, the US businesses had fared well,
those in the UK had maintained profitability, but trading conditions in
continental Europe remained 'extremely difficult'.
The UK's contribution to operating profit fell to 55 (59) per cent; the US
pushed its share to 40 (26) per cent, thanks to Red Wing and a strong
contribution from TV components. However, the input from continental Europe
declined from 10 to 2 per cent, with profits of Pounds 100,000 (Pounds
500,000).
By division, labels achieved a 'modest' profits rise to Pounds 3.44m (Pounds
3.48m) on turnover of Pounds 36m (Pounds 35.8m). Profits from the hangers
business grew to Pounds 1.57m (Pounds 1.21m) on turnover sharply up at
Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 16.6m), mostly as a result of Red Wing. Communications
components contributed Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 1.02m) on turnover ahead at
Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 13.1m). The stronger US economy had encouraged the
expansion and upgrading of cable networks.
Interest charges rose to Pounds 446,000 (Pounds 357,000) because of the Red
Wing buy. Gearing was 23 per cent (14 per cent), but will rise to about 75
per cent in the short term after the Elswick buy.
Earnings rose to 11.9p (10.4p) and the interim dividend is lifted 6 per cent
to 4.5p (4.25p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ticketing Group, which provides ticket sales, event management services and
computerised ticketing systems, reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 337,000 to Pounds 32,000 in the first half of 1994.
Turnover rose from Pounds 20.9m to Pounds 27.3m.
The company said trading had fluctuated widely in the period with record
highs in February and March to very low levels in May and June.
The USM-quoted company had operated as a joint venture between Expedier and
Wembley and was only constituted in its present form in February 1993 when
its refinancing and reorganisation was completed.
Wembley sold its 7.2 per cent stake earlier this year.
Earnings per share were 0.004p (0.04p).

<TEXT>
English National Investment, which seeks dividend income from a portfolio of
UK companies and property, announced increased interim distributions in both
classes of its shares - the first rise since 1990.
The payment for preferred ordinary shares is raised from 5p to 5.4p while
the dividend on deferred ordinary shares is 2.95p (2.55p). Directors of the
trust, part of the Henderson Touche Remnant stable, said they expect to pay
at least a maintained final for the year.
Net asset value, however, showed a marginal decline. At September 30, the
value per preferred was 356.4p per share, down from 374.4p at the trust's
March year-end and 364.8p at end-September 1993. The deferred shares had a
value of 281.4p per share at September 30, against 299.4p and 289.8p
respectively.
Net revenue for the six month period improved to Pounds 292,000 (Pounds
265,000) resulting in earnings of 9.1p (8.4p) per preferred and 6.6p (5.9p)
per deferred.

Butte Mining, the London-listed company, is to receive 400,000 shares in Gem
River Corporation, equivalent to 8.5 per cent of the issued capital, as a
reward for its work exploring Gem's sapphire property in Montana.
Gem has completed a private placing of 850,000 shares at Dollars 2 each to
raise about Dollars 1.7m (Pounds 1.07m) net and intends to seek a listing on
a recognised stock exchange. Butte has been given pre-emptive rights to

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Anagen sees first orders for AuraFlex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anagen, the lossmaking diagnostic equipment company, yesterday predicted
that sales should start to outweigh its development costs by 1996.
Although pre-tax losses rose from Pounds 1.78m to Pounds 1.99m in the six
months to June 30, the company said it expected next year to win its first
orders for AuraFlex, its automated immunoassay system that detects
infertility and thyroid deficiency in blood samples.
Turnover, however, fell from Pounds 1.27m to Pounds 483,000 as there were no
first half marketing payments from Organon Teknika, the Akzo Nobel
subsidiary which will manufacture and distribute the system.
Mr Mervyn Sennett, chief executive, blamed the shortfall for increased
operating losses of Pounds 2.11m (Pounds 1.34m).
Organon Teknika is expected to pay Anagen a further Pounds 1m in the next 12
months, but Mr Sennett said it was impossible to predict exactly when
hospitals using the system on trial would place firm orders.
'Our fortunes very much depend on AuraFlex,' he added.
The company, which raised Pounds 14.3m from its flotation last year, has
invested more than Pounds 20m on the system since 1989 and now has about
Pounds 6m cash left.
'We've been burning cash to meet development costs but we do not expect to
require more funds,' said Mr Sennett. 'Our reserves will see us through to
positive cashflow.'
Losses per share fell from 6.7p to 4.3p, reflecting last year's placing at
100p. The shares, which fell sharply in July but recovered slightly last
week, fell 4p at 59p.

<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the chartered accountants and business advisory firm,
yesterday announced fee income for the year to June of Pounds 384m, against
Pounds 383.3m last time.
Fees from audit and business advisory services rose 6 per cent to Pounds
146.1m - representing 38 per cent of the entire income for 1993-94.
Income from corporate finance and recovery dropped by 11 per cent to Pounds
47.6m and management consultancy dropped by 2 per cent to Pounds 81.9m.
Income from tax consultancy was unchanged.
Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner, said: 'The welcome improvements in the UK
economy have generated much needed growth in the audit practice with a
particularly strong increase in business advisory services.
'However, this improvement has led to a reduced number of business failures
and a consequent reduction in our corporate recovery business offset by an
increase in the corporate finance income.
'In overall terms our business lags behind our clients going into recession
and similarly lags behind them coming out. On the assumption that the UK
economy continues to recover we look forward to some overall growth in the
current year.'
Fee income from Europe rose 1.8 per cent to Pounds 894m. Combined worldwide
revenue was Dollars 3.98bn (Pounds 2.51bn) an increase of 2.3 per cent.

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Lionheart plunges back into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lionheart, the paintbrushes, housewares and retail merchandising equipment
group, continued its roller-coaster ride through recession and recovery by
plunging back into the red with losses of Pounds 840,000 for the first half
of 1994.
The outcome, struck after exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds
680,000, compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 518,000 at the previous
interim stage and Pounds 1.77m for the full 1993 year. The group is passing
its dividend (0.1p); it last did so after the 1992 full-year results - a
loss of Pounds 870,000 - only a year after returning to the dividend list in
1991.
Mr Paul Lever, chief executive, blamed the lack of economic upturn for the
performance. Turnover fell 11 per cent to Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 22.5m), with
poor sales in bathroom products and housewares as domestic housing markets
continued to languish.
The slow upturn persuaded retailers to defer purchase of retail
merchandising systems into the second half, but Lionheart now expects to
meet its full-year budget in this sector. However, direct consumer spending
on DIY products and housewares was unlikely to catch up, Mr Lever said.
Lionheart, in which Newell, the US paintbrush manufacturer, has a 20 per
cent stake, made a trading profit of Pounds 123,000 before interest and the
exceptional charge. 'We have cut out some marketing functions we cannot
afford at the moment and put a brake on product development,' Mr Lever said.
'Our payroll is now about 750, compared with more than 1,200 four years ago.
On the bright side, we have invested more than Pounds 7m in plant and
machinery over the last three years and expect to see continuing
productivity gains in future.'
The result had been largely discounted following a profits warning in
August.

<TEXT>
Healthcall Group, the UK's largest provider of out-of-hours doctors, has
been exonerated by the Office of Fair Trading over claims of
anti-competitive practices.
In July, the OFT announced that it would make 'some preliminary enquiries'
into charges regarding Healthcall's relationship with the British Medical
Association and its treatment of potential competitors.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director general of fair trading, said that the
BMA/Healthcall agreement with respect to doctors' deputising services did
not fall within the provisions of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act.
However, after considering whether it had effects on competition which might
merit investigation under the Fair Trading Act, Sir Bryan said he was
satisfied 'the agreement is not operating in a way which significantly
influences competition in this market.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Upton &amp; Southern sues Reject directors -
Proposals to save the stores business from collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Upton &amp; Southern Holdings, the stores group, is launching a Pounds 5.5m
share placing and open offer to rescue its business, and is suing five
former directors of the Reject Shop, the home furnishings retailer it
acquired in February.
Upton warned that Reject Shop would have to cease trading without the new
funds, leading to withdrawal of support from Upton's bankers and the
collapse of the business.
Upton acquired Reject Shop in a Pounds 2.5m all-paper offer in February. In
August it said that its financial and trading position had turned out to be
worse than represented at the time of the deal, resulting in a Pounds 2.75m
cash shortage.
Mr Jeffrey Gould, Upton's chief executive, said he was confident the placing
and offer, which is fully underwritten, would provide enough funds to turn
the chain round.
'We wanted to raise sufficient to give the company absolute security, but
not more than we needed,' he said. 'There is now light at the end of the
tunnel - hopefully quite a bright light.'
Middlesbrough-based Upton raised Pounds 4.5m in a rights issue in March,
largely to reduce debt and provide working capital for the Reject Shop.
However, it later discovered lower levels of stock in Reject Shop than
expected, which hit sales in May and June and forced the group to acquire
more stock.
When talks with an unnamed overseas investor over taking a stake fell
through, Mr Gould said Upton had been forced to make its August statement.
It has since taken legal advice and yesterday issued writs for damages
against five former Reject Shop directors.
Writs were issued for breach of fiduciary duty to Reject Shop, breach of
warranty and misrepresentation against former co-chairmen Mr Anthony Hawser
and Ms Anna Vinton, and former managing director Mr Geoffrey Frost, who is
additionally being sued for fraudulent misrepresentation.
Writs were also issued against former non-executive directors Mr David
Barker and Mr Clive Strowger, for breach of fiduciary duty and for
misrepresentation.
The former directors said they would vigorously contest the actions, which
Mr Hawser said in a statement were without foundation.
Mr Hawser added that Upton had been given full access to Reject Shop's
systems and accounts for three months before the acquisition. He said
Upton's cashflow problem had been caused not by shortage of stock but by
'the abandonment of The Reject Shop's well established policy of offering
obvious value for money'.
Both Mr Hawser and Ms Vinton are suing Upton's board for libel over its
comments in August.
The magnitude of Mr Gould's task was highlighted by results announced
yesterday for the 18 months to July 31, Upton's new year end, showing a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 4m on turnover of Pounds 18.1m, which included Pounds
685,000 from discontinued activities and Pounds 5.95m from acquisitions.
In the previous 12 months losses were Pounds 635,000 on turnover of Pounds
10.7m, including Pounds 2.79m from discontinued activities.
Losses per share were 20.7p (4.12p). There is again no dividend.
Upton plans a placing and open offer by MeesPierson and Townsley and Company
of 120.3m shares at 5p each, representing about 72 per cent of the enlarged
share capital of the company. The shares lost 1p to 5 1/2 p.
Some 30m shares have been placed firm with a new institutional investor,
with the balance subject to the open offer on a 49-for-20 basis.
The company said it had chosen this route rather than a rights issue, as
originally planned, in order to accommodate the unnamed new investor, which
had demanded 25 per cent of the new shares.
Mr Gould said about Pounds 2m of the proceeds would be used to obtain stock,
and the rest for working capital and store improvement.
He added that after improving product range and buying and strengthening
management, current trading in Reject Shop was encouraging, with sales in
the first 10 weeks of the financial year substantially ahead.
By refurbishing stores and offering 'reasonable quality products at very

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Amstrad incurs larger than expected Pounds
20m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad yesterday announced larger than expected annual pre-tax losses of
Pounds 19.9m, blaming stock write-downs, rationalisation costs and operating
losses in its mature consumer electronics business.
Commenting on the results, Mr Alan Sugar, chairman, said market conditions
throughout Europe in the consumer electronics industry 'remain depressed',
resulting in margin pressure and reduced sales.
The loss for the 12 months to June 30 - Amstrad's third consecutive annual
deficit - was struck after exceptional stock write-downs of Pounds 6.9m and
further European rationalisation costs of Pounds 4m mainly to cover
redundancies.
Analysts had been expecting losses of up to Pounds 5m and the shares were
marked sharply lower in the immediate wake of the announcement.
However, they subsequently recovered to close down 1 3/4 p at 25 1/4 p after
Mr Sugar and Mr David Rogers, the new chief executive, outlined a new
strategy for the group which will be divided into a number of 'autonomous'
business units reporting to Mr Rogers.
Under Amstrad's new strategy, the traditional consumer electronics business,
dubbed Amstrad Consumer Electronics, will become one of the new units. Ace
is expected to be subdivided into two businesses, a low margin/high volume
trading company which will continue to sell mature consumer electronics
products, and a development company charged with spotting market
opportunities and designing new products.
Other business units will include Dancall Radio, the cordless and cellular
telephone manufacturer acquired in September, Viglen, the direct sales
personal computer manufacturer which was purchased for about Pounds 60m in
June, and Betacom, the publicly quoted telephone equipment group in which
Amstrad has a 66 per cent stake.
Mr Sugar said these investments and an ink-jet printer joint venture with
IBM Jarfalla in Sweden 'leave me in a confident frame of mind that the
company will turn the corner during the current financial year'.
Sales fell almost 30 per cent to Pounds 217.1m (Pounds 308.5m) as Amstrad
reduced its activities in those consumer electronics product areas, 'where
it was impossible to obtain even a modest margin'.
In the previous year, it incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 20.5m after
Pounds 33.5m reorganisation costs, including goodwill write-offs on its
Spanish operations.
At the operating level, the group reported a Pounds 15.5m loss in the latest
period after a Pounds 1.84m contribution from acquisitions, compared to a
Pounds 15m profit the previous year. Mr Sugar blamed the depressed state of
the market and the high level of overheads carried by the consumer
electronics business.
The losses were partly offset by net interest receipts of Pounds 7.14m
(Pounds 7.21m). The cash pile fell from Pounds 167.1m to Pounds 137.7m,
reflecting part-payment for Viglen.
Losses per share narrowed to 3.2p (4p) and an unchanged final dividend of
0.3p is recommended, making an unchanged total of 0.5p.
Amstrad, in which Mr Sugar retains a 36 per cent stake, also announced a
proposed 1-for-5 share consolidation.

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: VideoLogic predicts higher interim losses
of over Pounds 3.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VideoLogic, the electronics company demerged four months ago from Avesco,
the broadcast equipment and services group, said yesterday that it expected
to report an operating loss of between Pounds 3.5m and Pounds 3.8m for the
half year to September, compared with a deficit of Pounds 2.3m last time.
The shares, 45p at the time of the demerger, have been slipping steadily and
closed yesterday at 22 1/2 p, down 4 1/2 p.
The company said the likely losses reflected heavy spending on development
and marketing and the continuing price war in the personal computer
industry.
Mr Derek MacLaren, chairman, said the announcement was not a profits
warning. When the company was floated, it had agreed to provide its
shareholders with progress reports at regular intervals, as well as half
yearly figures.
He and fellow directors were yesterday giving investors and analysts a
series of presentations on the state of the company and its future.
VideoLogic estimated sales for the first half at about Pounds 5.5m, some 20
per cent ahead of last year. Price cutting by personal computer
manufacturers was affecting margins and reducing profitability.
The company said its cost base was under continuous review, with an emphasis
on cutting product costs and improving operational efficiency. It expected
that the cost of research and market development as a percentage of sales
would reduce during 1995.
VideoLogic designs silicon chips and circuit boards which confer multimedia
capabilities on conventional personal computers. Sales growth has been due
primarily to a mass market product - 928Movie - which improves operating
system performance, as well as adding multimedia.
The company is still in the development phase, however, with a high
requirement for cash for research and development and marketing. The
demerger from Avesco was a consequence of this requirement.

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hampson warns after demand disappoints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hampson Industries, the diversified industrial company, yesterday issued a
profits warning after experiencing 'disappointing' demand in the furniture
and aerospace sectors.
The West Bromwich-based company, which released its statement soon after
trading ended yesterday, warned that profits would be unlikely to reach
market forecasts of about Pounds 6.5m for the year.
'If you ask people in the furniture or carpets industry, you will find that
retailers are having a rough time, and the same is true in aerospace,' said
Mr Ray Way, chairman.
'It is a market thing. We are happy about our strategy and we are regarding
this as temporary.'
The company stated that its first-half results were likely to be similar to
last year, when it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.48m on turnover from
continuing operations of Pounds 43.5m.
Profits are forecast to increase in the second half, but will still fail to
meet the market's expectations.
Last year the company achieved a 75 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 4.23m, which included a Pounds 937,000 goodwill write-off following
the closure of the construction division. Performances improved across its
four main activities: furniture, precision engineering concentrated on
aircraft refurbishment, cleaning and aluminium refining.
The company has brought forward the timing of its interim results to the end
of November, moving its full year to the end of June.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Azlan Group, a distributor of advanced computer networking
products which came to the market in November at 230p, fell sharply again
yesterday.
The shares, which have fallen from a peak of 281p in June, shed a further
32p yesterday in thin trading to close at 128p.
The company did not issue a statement, but there were market rumours that a
large institutional investor had become disenchanted with high technology
new issues in general and had decided to sell.
The collapse in the group's share price began in June after the company
issued a warning that profits in the first half of the current year would
not match those of last year.

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Gleeson ahead 9% but warns of housing
market slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The revival in the new housing market underpinned a 9 per cent rise, from
Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 8.91m, in annual pre-tax profits at MJ Gleeson, the
Surrey-based construction, housebuilding and property company.
Completions in the year to June 30 totalled a record 499 units with the
average price increasing by Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 84,500. However, Mr Colin
McLellan, finance director, cautioned that the housing market had slowed
considerably, particularly in recent weeks.
He also warned that margins were likely to come under renewed pressure as
the 'fragile state of the market' was further undermined by rising costs
from building materials suppliers. He said that so far this year, timber
prices had jumped by some 20 per cent, bricks by 5 per cent and steel by 8
per cent. In addition, concrete blocks were in short supply. Trading
conditions in the contracting business were 'very tough' and showed little
chance of improvement in the forseeable future.
The company was increasingly looking overseas and had recently completed a
contract on the Kenyan airport project. There was the strong possibility of
further work in east Africa, as well as in Europe.
The outlook, however, remained cautious. 'It's very difficult to take a
short-term view with the housing market up and down as it is, and the
contracting business so difficult,' said Mr McLellan. On a more positive
note, the recent acquisition of the residential development business of the
Portman Building Society had provided a boost to the landbank.
Turnover was Pounds 174m (Pounds 168m). Earnings per share edged up from
57.54p to 58.21p and a final dividend of 10.81p is recommended, making a
total of 14.16p (12.75p).

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: A Fisher's Pounds 35m masks setback - Lower
seafood profits and lettuce prices make disappointing cocktail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing results in the European seafood and North American produce
divisions were behind a fall in annual operating profits from continuing
activities at Albert Fisher from Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 38.7m.
The food processing and distribution group blamed sharply lower produce
prices for the setback in North America, where profits almost halved.
It cited as an example the average price for a case of iceberg lettuces at
Dollars 5.20, compared with Dollars 8.05 a year earlier.
The fall in European seafood profits reflected intense competition in the
mussels market, combined with a sharp rise in prawn prices and difficulty in
sourcing white fish.
Mr Stephen Walls, chairman, said it had not been an easy year. 'We may be
disappointed - but we are certainly not gloomy about the prospects of the
group.'
Pre-tax profits for the year to August 31 rose from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds
34.8m.
The latest figure included an exceptional gain of Pounds 600,000 and a
Pounds 3.6m contribution from discontinued operations, compared with a
previous exceptional charge of Pounds 15.4m and Pounds 7.5m input from
discontinued operations.
Sales improved to Pounds 1.42bn (Pounds 1.28bn), including Pounds 51.5m
(Pounds 122.1m) from discontinued operations.
The shares fell 3p to 44p yesterday - still below the Pounds 51m rights
issue offer of 52p in May.
North American operating profits tumbled to Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 11.6m) on
sales up from Pounds 360m to Pounds 482m. The group said the intense price
competition for produce, following excess supplies, had cost it Dollars 7m
(Pounds 4.32m).
Fresh Western, the Californian fresh produce supplier acquired at the
beginning of the year, suffered an operating loss of Dollars 2m, although
the group said the export side had fared better than expected with Dollars
50m worth of sales.
In Europe, operating profits improved by Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 32.3m, and
sales increased from Pounds 802m to Pounds 891m.
Profits in the seafood sector, which the group has targeted for growth, fell
from Pounds 10m to Pounds 8.1m. Sales grew by Pounds 40m to Pounds 166m,
including a Pounds 30m contribution from Rahbek, the Danish-based seafood
company bought for Pounds 59m after the rights issue.
The fresh produce sector increased profits from Pounds 6.4m to Pounds 10.7m,
reflecting better prices, particularly for citrus fruit and onions. Food
processing profits were flat at Pounds 13.5m.
Net debt at the year-end was Pounds 93.5m (Pounds 84.5m). But gearing is
expected to fall to below 30 per cent following the recent Pounds 37.1m
disposal of parts of Stratford-upon-Avon Foods and Rowats Foods to Campbell
Grocery Products, a subsidiary of the US food group.
Earnings per share were 3.34p (2.43p).
The proposed final dividend is maintained at 1.9p, taking the total for the
year to 3.71p (3.75p).
COMMENT
This company is under pressure to maintain its dividend and high yield,
which is about the only thing it has to offer after these disappointing
results. Fortunately the balance sheet remains strong, although the rights
issue could be seen as robbing Peter to pay Paul. There is no denying that
the group has radically changed shape over the past couple of years - the
question is whether the prospects have improved as much as the management
claims, or whether it will remain vulnerable to commodity price swings. If
the seafood division delivers the expected growth, profits this year could
be about Pounds 40m, giving a low looking prospective multiple of 11. The
main support will continue to be the 10 per cent yield, assuming an
unchanged dividend.

Mr Richard Andrew joined Wimpey in June 1992 from Private Capital Group and

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Adscene expands print side with Pounds 7m
purchases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adscene, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, is acquiring two printing
businesses - Flair Press and Charles Elphick - for up to Pounds 6.98m.
Mr Nigel Chevin-Hall, finance director, said that the group's current
printing business in Welshpool, Powys, had seen an upturn in demand from
outside customers and the board considered it 'an opportune time to expand
the printing operations'.
Mr Chevin-Hall said that external publishing turnover in the year to May 31
was about Pounds 17m to Pounds 18m. The annualised figure for Flair and
Elphick would boost the Pounds 2m from the Welshpool operations to about
Pounds 18m, balancing the group in turnover terms.
He added, however, that the group's overall publishing margins were about 20
per cent, while Flair and Elphick currently had margins of 11 per cent with
targets of about 14 per cent.
The initial consideration for Flair is Pounds 4.35m in shares. Beeson
Gregory is placing 1.53m at 271p to raise Pounds 4.15m on behalf of the
vendors. Mr Charles Grant-Salmon, chairman of both Flair and Elphick, is to
be issued 55,350 shares. Consideration for Elphick is Pounds 80,000 cash.
There are further profit-related payments to a maximum of Pounds 2.55m in
cash or shares.
With Flair comes debt of about Pounds 4.5m, after a now-complete Pounds 6m
capital expenditure programme, making Adscene's borrowings about Pounds 10m.
Pro forma gearing, after the write-down of goodwill on the acquisition,
would be 78 per cent. Mr Chevin-Hall said that should reduce to 30 per cent,
with debt of Pounds 5m, by May 1996.

FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Call for inquiry into Aero Hamble float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Labour MP will be writing to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, this weekend calling for a DTI inquiry into the flotation of
Aerostructures Hamble, the Southampton aircraft components maker.
Mr John Denham, MP for Southampton Itchen, has already tabled a Commons
motion seeking an inquiry 'to establish if any relevant information which
could have been disclosed in the prospectus was withheld and, if so, by whom
and to whose benefit'.
Aerostructures was floated at 120p a share in June. Last week it issued a
second profits warning following production difficulties, and the shares
fell to 24p. Yesterday the shares were 31p, off  1/2 p.
The company is now seeking a new chief executive to replace Mr Andy Barr,
who accepted early retirement without compensation last week. Mr Barr made
Pounds 1.75m from the flotation.
Yesterday the management and representatives of NM Rothschild, the company's
advisers, were in Scotland, continuing this week's round of talks with
shareholders who have watched the value of their investment fall by 80 per
cent in just five months.
Mr Denham said yesterday that he was concerned about the future of the
company as many of its workers lived in his constituency. Aerostructures is
sited in the neighbouring Eastleigh constituency.
Mr David Chidgey, the Liberal Democrat who won the Eastleigh by-election,
said yesterday he 'believed it was unconventional' that Mr Denham had not
approached him before tabling the motion on Aerostructures.
Mr Chidgey, who once worked for Folland - a predecessor company of
Aerostructures, is due to meet the management next week. He said he had
spoken to the management and Rothschild in Scotland yesterday, and had been
delighted by their positive assurances and commitment to putting together a
programme for 1995.

eventual returns.'
Losses per share were 0.3p (earnings of 1.95p).
Kleinwort Second Endowment Policy Trust reported net asset value of 98.5p

FT  21 OCT 94 / Revenue growth spurs IBM back into profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines reported much higher than expected revenues
and earnings for the third quarter, raising hopes that the world's largest
computer company will achieve its first year of profit and revenue growth
since 1990.
Third quarter net earnings were Dollars 689m (Pounds 436m), or Dollars 1.18
per share after payment of preferred stock dividends, compared with a loss
of Dollars 87m or 15 cents per share last year.
Revenues grew 8.6 per cent to Dollars 15.4bn. Last year's figures are
adjusted for the sale of IBM's Federal Systems Company, restructuring
charges and accounting changes.
'There is evidence that we are moving into the second phase of the
transformation of IBM,' said Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive.
Although cost cuts will continue, IBM is now focused on growing revenues,
said Mr Jerome York, chief financial officer.
Revenues from sales of IBM's traditional mainframe computers, its most
profitable products, increased for the first time in more than two years as
demand exceeded supply. 'We shipped all of the mainframes we could build,'
said Mr York.
Sales of IBM's AS/400 mid-range computers grew about 25 per cent. IBM
continues to have problems in the personal computer sector. Although
revenues increased modestly worldwide, US results were 'sluggish'.
Semiconductor sales grew strongly with year to date sales of about Dollars
2.2bn. IBM may forge an agreement with another chip maker to make better use
of its chip plants, Mr York hinted.
Gross profit margins were 39.9 per cent of sales in the third quarter. Gross
margins have now been stable for two years, said Mr York.
IBM cut overall expenses 13 per cent, or Dollars 700m, from the 1993 third
quarter. Through the first nine months of 1994, total expenses fell Dollars
2.8bn. Mr York said the workforce was cut by about 3,000 in the third
quarter, to 232,000. Another 10,000 to 12,000 jobs will be cut in the fourth
quarter. IBM no longer expected to reach its year-end staffing target of
215,000, mainly because of demand for mainframes.
For the year to date, net earnings were Dollars 1.7bn, or Dollars 2.86 per
share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 464m, or 81 cents per share last
year, before restructuring charges and an accounting change.
Revenue for the first nine months was Dollars 44.2bn, a 6 per cent increase.
IBM's share price, which has gained 9 per cent since the beginning of the
month, yesterday closed down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 75.

FT  21 OCT 94 / TeleWest will proceed with flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TeleWest, the UK's largest cable operator, has decided to go ahead with an
early share offering in both London and New York.
The decision comes only five months after the cable group postponed
flotation because of difficult market conditions.
TeleWest now plans to go to market in the next couple of months making it
the first cable company in the UK to have a London Stock Exchange listing.
It appears that the flotation of TeleWest, a joint venture between US West,
the US telephone company, and Telecommunications Inc, the largest US cable
company, will resemble the original plan and could value the company at as
much as Pounds 1.9bn. The main aim of the float would be to establish a
value for TeleWest while making the company a more British organisation.
This would involve a stake of about 20 per cent fully diluted which would be
sold, in line with the original proposal, through a placing and
intermediaries offer on both sides of the Atlantic.
Such an offer would seek to raise between Pounds 300m and Pounds 370m in new
money. TeleWest owns and operates 16 cable franchises and has minority
stakes in a further seven covering a total of 3.6m homes.
Some 1.3m of the 3.6m homes are passed by cable networks and 1.2m of them
have been released for marketing. The total number of cable television
subscribers is 275,000. In addition, the company has sold 190,000
residential telephone lines and 30,000 business lines.
TeleWest's return to the market has been influenced by the current brighter
outlook for new issues and the good performance of the stock of cable
companies such as International Cabletel and Bell Cable Media in the US,
which have risen sharply since flotation on the Nasdaq market.
The much larger British Sky Broadcasting could be coming to the market at
the same time as TeleWest, but this is not seen as a barrier, although
Goldman Sachs, which is advising BSkyB, will no longer be involved in the
TeleWest float. Morgan Stanley has now joined Kleinwort Benson as TeleWest
advisers.
Both BSkyB and TeleWest see cable and satellite television as complementary
to BSkyB. The cable industry as a retailer of new television channels is
mainly a distributor while BSkyB (in which Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times, has a significant stake) is primarily a programmer.
Overall there are now more than 750,000 cable television subscribers in the
UK and more than 500,000 telephone lines installed.

FT  21 OCT 94 / At Pounds 1, do you get what you pay for?: 'Cheap' deals in
the City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the cost of a City cappuccino, last week saw plenty of opportunities for
canny bargain hunters. Three hundred estate agency branches, a fleet of 669
executive cars, the right to buy a prestige office block, all changed hands
for just Pounds 1. Recent deals for the same price - or even less - have
included a photoprocessing company, a banking group and a French bakery
equipment maker.
Inevitably, all the transactions involved taking on either a loss-making
business or hefty debts, and sometimes both. However, the range of the deals
varied enormously and with it the potential for the buyer to secure a
profitable business for the somewhat minuscule investment.
Bankers involved in deals where assets have been sold for 'nominal sums' -
which usually equates to a pound - say that the degree of liabilities
accompanying the sale depend on the urgency of the transaction.
'If it's a fire sale, the chances of the buyer pulling off a good deal are
greatly increased,' said one. 'It all depends on the situation of the vendor
 -and quite often the attitude of its bankers.'
Hambro Countrywide last week paid Pounds 1 for NEA, the estate agency
business of Nationwide building society, acquiring 300 branches among assets
worth Pounds 5.2m. To compensate further, chiefly for the fact that Hambro
was taking on a business which had cost Nationwide more than Pounds 200m,
and lost Pounds 13.9m last year, the building society threw in a fleet of
669 executive cars - typically a mid-range Rover under two years old - for
the price of half a pint of premium lager. It also added the 255-strong
fleet from Nationwide Surveyors, the surveying group Hambro bought for
Pounds 12m as part of the deal, for the same price.
Mr Harry Hill, Hambro Countrywide joint managing director, said that NEA
could be broken up and sold for 'in excess of Pounds 6m tomorrow' taking
into account the value of the group's name. 'Of course we could asset strip
it and make a quick killing. But we believe we can get more out of the
business in the longer term.'
For little more than a zone one Tube ride, property group Argent has been
given the chance to re-develop a prime office site of 120,000sq ft in the
City. Argent already owns the leasehold on the property - Suffolk House in
EC4 - and paid Pounds 1 to Midland Bank as part of a Pounds 17.4m deal in
which the bank freed itself from the lease agreement.
The nominal sum allows Argent to exercise an option to buy the freehold and
analysts suggested that this would cost in the region of Pounds 40m.
Sources at the property group suggested that the actual development would
cost a further Pounds 20m. Mr Michael Freeman, joint chief executive,
estimates that the development would realise in the region of Pounds 70m
when completed in 1997 on rents of around Pounds 37.50 per sq ft and a 6 per
cent yield.
Mr Graham Stanley, property analyst at Goldman Sachs, said: 'Where a lot of
developers come unstuck is in assuming rental values will rise at rate to
make the deal pay. Rents on those kind of properties are currently around
Pounds 30-Pounds 32.50 a sq ft, so they've some way to go. But that's the
risk of the business.'
Birkby, the space management group, recently paid a 'nominal sum' to
takeover I-Mex, an insolvent private property group. For its Pounds 1,
Birkby took on the mortgages and debts of I-Mex which the group's bankers
wrote down from Pounds 35m to Pounds 25m.
'We got it for a keen price, but these were specialist work spaces,' said Mr
Kim Taylor-Smith, deputy chief executive. 'There are few companies which
would be interested in this kind of development. The bank's options were
very limited.'
Other recent Pounds 1 deals include the Bank of England's purchase of
National Home Loans from National Mortgage Bank; APV's sale of French bakery
equipment maker Pavailler (for FFr1 - about 12p) and London International
Group's sale of its Colourcare International photoprocessing business to
management.
All the buyers contacted admitted that their small investment would require
hard work to turn around. As Mr Hill pointed out: 'We were lucky in that we
didn't buy any liabilities other than the potential losses. If we can turn
it around, there's no doubt it will have been a great deal. If we can't, it
won't look so clever.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / GM's recovery held back by production strains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The recovery at General Motors, a symbol of US manufacturing industry's
turnround in the 1990s, stalled in recent months, according to figures
released yesterday. Two strikes in North America, delays in launching new
vehicles and a production system that was straining to cope with demand were
behind the company's difficulties.
The news was contained in third-quarter figures released yesterday, and
wiped more than 5 per cent, or some Dollars 2bn, off GM's market value.
Mr Jack Smith, president and chief executive, said: 'We are not satisfied
with out overall performance in the third quarter, and we continue to
recognise the need for further improvement.' He added that there would
continue to be 'ups and downs' in GM's recovery, but that higher sales and
the launch of more profitable models would support higher profits in future.
Despite the disappointment, GM's figures yesterday demonstrated the extent
of the turnround in its core North American car and truck businesses. It
lost Dollars 328.4m in what is traditionally the weakest three-month period
in the year, an improvement of about Dollars 500m compared with the same
period in 1993.
The company said two strikes over the summer cost it Dollars 140m, as
autoworkers vented their frustration at GM's refusal to hire more staff to
cope with higher production levels. The increase in vehicle sales in North
America, which were 90,000 higher than a year before, also caused overtime
costs to jump and forced GM to pay premium rates to ship parts by air in
some cases to keep production lines running. Analysts said the strains in
the GM production system demonstrated how far it still needed to go to
compete with its more efficient US rivals, Ford and Chrysler.
GM's international business, which has been the star performer of its
operations in recent years, recorded a 60 per cent drop in profits, to
Dollars 240m, despite a 5 per cent increase in sales.
GM said it was now paying taxes in some European countries for the first
time. Analysts said the launch of the Corsa, a small car with lower profit
margins, had also dampened profitability in Europe.
Total net income of Dollars 552m, which compared with a loss of Dollars 113m
in the 1993 quarter, was buoyed by Dollars 200m in one-off tax benefits,
along with big gains at its computer services subsidiary, EDS, and its
financing arm, GMAC. Earnings per share were 40 cents.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Nomura to set up prime brokerage in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nomura International is to establish a London-based international prime
brokerage business providing a full range of services including securities
lending and custody, in order to service the growing number of
European-based hedge funds.
The Japanese firm will be the first non-US participant in that business. So
far, the international prime brokerage business has been the preserve of a
handful of US-based securities firms who had been servicing the US hedge
fund's expansion into international securities.
Mr Simon Luhr, deputy managing director in charge of securities lending and
prime brokerage at Nomura International, said the number of European-based
hedge funds had grown from fewer than 20 to close to 100 in the past few
years. Hedge funds typically operate with minimal support services,
contracting out back-office functions in order to control costs.
'When the US hedge funds began to diversify out of domestic assets, demand
for international prime brokerage services arose,' Mr Luhr said. A prime
broker is a broker/dealer with the capability of providing execution,
securities lending, financing, clearance and custody and reporting services
to clients.
Nomura is already a significant participant in the securities lending
business and, since changes in Japanese regulations, has acquired a trust
bank so it can begin offering securities custody services as well.
Mr Luhr said the move into international prime brokerage reflected changes
within Nomura. 'We've moved away from our regional structure and into global
product lines.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / PLO hits at Israeli decision to close borders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GAZA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel took new security measures yesterday aimed at curbing Islamic
extremists, as fears grew among Palestinians that Israel intended to impose
a permanent separation between the two communities.
The Palestine Liberation Organisation condemned Israel's decision to close
indefinitely its borders with the Gaza Strip and West Bank, preventing tens
of thousands of Palestinians from working in Israel. The government is to
allow in 15,000 more foreigners to replace Palestinian construction workers,
suggesting the ban will not be lifted quickly.
The Israeli cabinet also agreed unspecified measures to give the security
forces greater freedom to confront the Hamas Islamic group, responsible for
Wednesday's suicide bombing of a commuter bus in Tel Aviv, which killed 21
people.
'The government decided to put at (security services') disposal additional
means required in order to intensify actions against Hamas and its military
wing,' the cabinet said.
Officials said the measures could include arrests, deportations, demolition
of homes, tougher processes of detention and interrogation, the expansion of
the police force and pre-emptive raids.
This may represent the start of a radical policy of physically separating
Israelis from Palestinians. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's premier, said on
Wednesday Israel would have to decide soon whether the separation would
become permanent.
Hours after the Israeli cabinet meeting ended, rockets were fired by
guerrillas in Lebanon into northern Israel, but no one was injured. Earlier,
Lebanon said seven people had been killed by Israeli shelling of south
Lebanon in retaliation for the Hamas suicide bombing.
Mr Marwan Kanafani, official spokesman for Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman, said the latest Israeli moves would punish 2m Palestinians for the
actions of a handful of militants, and would breed more hatred and
instability. 'The measures are a declaration of war, of economic and social
war, against Palestinian society and will affect very negatively the peace
process,' he said.
Mr Kanafani said the measures would create despair among Palestinians and
play into the hands of the extremists. He added that the only hope for
curbing extremism was to speed up Israel's withdrawal from the occupied West
Bank, and introduce economic measures that would 'give Palestinians a sense
that they had a better life ahead after more than 25 years of Israeli
occupation'.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Blair puts fresh blood into shadow cabinet: 'Modernisers'
promoted to economic portfolios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday announced a shake-up of the shadow cabinet designed
to promote fresh blood and put the main economic departments in the hands of
his close allies.
After a day of tortuous negotiations with the 18 shadow ministers elected by
Labour MPs on Wednesday, Mr Blair settled on a line-up in which only five
portfolios remain unchanged.
The core economic appointments went to Mr Gordon Brown, who remains shadow
chancellor, Ms Harriet Harman, who becomes shadow employment secretary, and
Mr Jack Cunningham, who takes over as shadow trade and industry secretary.
All three support the 'modernising' group which has helped Mr Blair to move
Labour away from its former tax and spend economic philosophy.
Mr Robin Cook, a traditionalist who had made plain his desire to remain
close to the heart of economic policymaking, moves from the DTI brief to
take over as shadow foreign secretary.
The move was described as a promotion, reflecting Mr Cook's achievement in
topping the poll for both the shadow cabinet and the MPs' section of the
party's national executive.
However, in a gesture to the traditionalists, Mr Cook has been promised
membership of a new economic policy sub-committee which will also include Mr
John Prescott, the traditionalist deputy leader.
The big loser appeared to be Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former acting leader,
who was re-elected to the shadow cabinet in second place, but failed to win
one of the three big jobs shadowing the Treasury, Home Office or Foreign
Office.
Mrs Beckett, who unsuccessfully contested the leadership on a broadly
traditionalist platform, was appointed shadow health secretary after failing
to persuade Mr Blair that her popularity deserved a greater reward.
Mr Jack Straw, a leading moderniser who ran Mr Blair's leadership campaign,
was promoted from environment to the Home Office portfolio, in spite of
polling poorly in the elections.
Ms Mo Mowlam, another moderniser, moves from national heritage to replace Mr
Kevin McNamara as shadow Northern Ireland secretary.
The shadow cabinet's leading leftwing members moved sideways. Mr David
Blunkett switched from health to education, Mr Michael Meacher from open
government to transport, and Ms Joan Lestor from the family to overseas
development.
Mr Chris Smith, formerly environmental protection spokesman, replaces Ms
Mowlam at national heritage; Mr Frank Dobson moves from transport to
environment and London; and Mrs Ann Taylor moves from education to leader of
the Commons and citizens' charter.
Mr Gavin Strang retains his agriculture brief, Mr Donald Dewar, social
security, Mr George Robertson, Scotland, Mr Ron Davies, Wales and Mr David
Clark, defence.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Art Ryan, leaving Chase Manhattan to run Prudential Insurance of the US,
has timed his move well. The US banking cycle is probably at its peak, with
the easy profit gains behind it. Chase's shareholders have benefited from
the partnership between Mr Ryan and his boss, Mr Tom Labrecque; they may now
have cause to worry that the single-minded focus on profitability, Mr Ryan's
gift to Chase in recent years, may be diluted just as the bank needs to find
ways of replacing the easy ride on the yield curve.

FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Bank lending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK banks are in danger of experiencing economic recovery with precious
little growth in their loan books. Their problem was highlighted by
yesterday's M4 money supply figures showing bank lending strangely subdued.
If previous patterns had been repeated, corporate lending should have been
much greater at this stage of the cycle.
A partial explanation lies in the corporate sector's strong profits growth.
In the second quarter, retained earnings jumped by 52 per cent year on year,
allowing companies to pay down debt and fund capital projects through cash
flow. On top of this, those requiring additional capital have turned
increasingly to the equity and bond markets rather than banks.
UK companies are still quite highly geared, supporting the view that most
will continue to pay down debt. But if cash flow becomes insufficient to
cover expected increases in capital spending, industry will have to turn
elsewhere for funds. As interest rates rise, the increased cost of capital
in the equity markets may make bank loans relatively more attractive.

FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US telecoms
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two main lessons from this week's results from US long distance
telecoms operators. First, that large price cuts are no longer needed to
stimulate growth in call volumes. Second, that there is little pressure on
the three main operators - AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint - to resume the frenetic
price-cutting of previous years.
The overall market is growing at 9 per cent a year. Some of that is down to
robust economic growth. But the economy is also becoming more telecoms
intensive: customers are lapping up new services such as voice mail and data
communications. Given that the operators' main cost - paying for access to
local networks - is also falling, it is hardly surprising that margins have
widened.
Meanwhile, the industry has settled into a stable phase. MCI, which used to
cut prices aggressively to build up market share, is now emphasising margin
improvement. That means AT&amp;T is not forced to respond with its own price
cuts and has even been able to raise prices on a selective basis. The
entrance of the Baby Bells into long-distance market could have upset this
modus vivendi, but legislation enabling that collapsed last month.
The real concerns about the companies relate to their activities outside the
long-distance market. All three have ambitious strategies to enter wireless
communications. In AT&amp;T's case, that has already diluted earnings. That
explains why the rosy outlook for long-distance services has not been
reflected in the groups' share prices.

FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: German stores
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kaufhof Holding's offer for the outstanding shares in Horten is a prelude to
a full-scale merger of the two companies' department store operations. Much
needed rationalisation, impossible to implement had Kaufhof stuck with a
mere majority stake, should follow. The result will be a further shake-up of
the German retail sector following the merger of Karstadt and Hertie last
year.
This is welcome, as German retailing is inefficient by international
standards. For example, the return on assets at the big stores groups is
around 1 per cent, assuming freehold properties are written up to market
value. Wages as a proportion of turnover are high, reflecting cosy relations
between management and workforce. Innovation and competition are stifled by
regulation which not even the free-market oriented Chancellor Helmut Kohl
has the courage to eliminate.
The deals show that the big retailers are at last determined to address some
of these deep-seated problems. Profitability will improve as the merged
groups pool purchasing and distribution and rationalise their property
portfolios. There will also be staff reductions, but these are unlikely to
be dramatic. One problem is that the benefits of these measures, especially
pronounced in the case of Karstadt/Hertie, will take years to feed through
to the bottom line. Against a deteriorating consumer spending background,
shares in the large German retailers are likely to continue to underperform.

FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: TeleWest calls again
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is little doubt that investors will prove rather more receptive to
TeleWest's flotation now than five months ago. General market conditions are
healthier, despite some recent new issue disasters in the UK. More
importantly, Wall Street's attitude to the UK cable industry has changed
dramatically over the past few months.
Shares in International Cabletel, issued at Dollars 27 a year ago, had
slumped to just Dollars 19 when the TeleWest and General Cable flotations
were pulled at the end of May. They have since risen by more than 50 per
cent. Bell Cablemedia, which went ahead with its Nasdaq listing in June, has
done almost as well and Comcast UK's shares are up almost 30 per cent since
its Dollars 200m stock issue last month.
The new enthusiasm is based partly on the cable companies' prospects for
gaining more telephone subscribers from British Telecommunications. These
have been improved by recent regulatory moves.
If the climate is now much more favourable for TeleWest there is one new
complication: BSkyB is planning to float at the same time. The clash has
already forced Goldman Sachs to step down as TeleWest's joint global
co-ordinator because of its similar role for BSkyB. Although both sides
insist cable and satellite do not compete, it is hard to deny they will do
so eventually. When it comes to the competition for investors, TeleWest can
point to its opportunities in telecommunications. But BSkyB has one
important attraction: it makes money.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Russian leadership set to impose tough curbs on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian cabinet yesterday approved an austere budget for 1995, amid
criticism from the International Monetary Fund of the government's
spendthrift policies in recent months.
Senior IMF officials in Moscow took the Russian government to task this week
for failing to control government spending and credit creation, and not
attacking the macro-economic fundamentals behind the rouble's crash earlier
this month.
Mr Michael Mussa, the chief IMF economist, said on Wednesday: 'Until a cap
is put on spending, there is no hope of containing the budgetary situation.
That needs to be demonstrated by the government.'
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's government - which has in the past
preferred a gradualist approach - appears to have accepted the IMF's view
that there is no alternative to tough fiscal and monetary policies.
However, such efforts may be thwarted by hostility between President Boris
Yeltsin and Mr Chernomyrdin, arising from the rouble crisis.
The draft budget, approved at a closed meeting of the cabinet, yesterday,
aims to reduce the budget deficit next year to 8.3 per cent of gross
domestic product and bring inflation down to 1 per cent a month by the end
of the year.
The draft sharply reduces subsidies to agriculture and the coal industry but
maintains defence spending at 5.1 per cent of GDP. It must still be passed
by parliament, and may be indirectly opposed by spending ministries.
According to the Russian news agency Interfax, Mr Chernomyrdin told the
cabinet that the collapse of the rouble demonstrated the dangers of
loosening fiscal and monetary controls. Many economists attribute the rouble
crisis to massive government subsidies to industry and agriculture in August
and September.
Traditionally, spending ministries such as defence and agriculture have
restrained their objections to austerity during the drafting of the budget
but have lobbied for additional revenues after the budget has been passed.
Mr Chernomyrdin sought to pre-empt that, telling ministers that henceforth
they must operate on the basis of 'an accurately calculated real budget'
rather than expecting that 'something more will be given' later in the year.
IMF officials have warned the Russian government that it will not receive
further assistance until it cuts spending. One said a strong Russian plan
would unlock support.

FT  21 OCT 94 / President at the eye of the storm: Attacks on Walesa reflect
political uncertainty in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poland's President Lech Walesa, the former army corporal and shipyard
electrician who led the Solidarity movement to victory against communism in
1989, is under fire from all sides.
The shots are the opening salvos of what promises to be a bruising and
prolonged presidential election campaign, in which Mr Walesa is fighting not
only for re-election but also for the incorporation of strong presidential
powers in the new constitution currently in preparation.
Thus far Mr Walesa is the only declared candidate for an election that will
not take place until November 1995. His most likely challenger is the
smooth, English-speaking Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, a rising star in the last
communist government who re-emerged as the eminence grise behind last year's
electoral victory of the Communist party's successor, the Democratic Left
Alliance (SLD).
But the most painful attacks on Mr Walesa to date have come not from his
ex-communist opponents but his former Solidarity allies. They have regrouped
in a new coalition called the Freedom Union, following their defeat at
elections called by Mr Walesa, against their advice, in September last year.
That election brought victory for the former communists. For many former
Solidarity supporters, calling the election was the most serious of a string
of tactical miscalculations made by Mr Walesa since he split the Solidarity
movement by his determination to become Poland's first post-communist
president in 1990.
Last week Mr Bronislaw Geremek, the Solidarity veteran and chairman of the
Freedom Union parliamentary group, told the president to his face: 'You pose
a threat to constitutional order and democracy in Poland.'
Mr Geremek's accusation was followed by harsh criticism from a string of
former close Walesa allies, including the former prime minister, Ms Hanna
Suchocka. All accused the president of subverting democracy and parliament
through what they claimed were his personalised, unaccountable meddling in
delicate affairs of state.
Mr Walesa's cunning political style helped him outwit the communist
apparatchiks five years ago. But the growing army of Mr Walesa's critics
view such talents as unsuitable for the president of a democratic society
based on law.
Critics liken him increasingly to a typical Communist party first secretary
under the old regime, used to giving personal orders to cronies and
oblivious to legal or constitutional restraint.
Under the terms of the 'small constitution', an interim document containing
amendments to the communist-era constitution still in force, Mr Walesa
secured partial control over the defence, foreign and internal affairs
ministries.
His intention to maintain and, if possible, strengthen these powers lie
behind the actions for which he is now being criticised. These include his
interference in the allocation of TV broadcasting licences by the Radio and
TV Council, an independent regulatory body. This is seen as an attempt to
ensure that licences went to groups likely to support his political aims.
And he has used his defence powers to manoeuvre inside the top reaches of
the military establishment in a bid to strengthen his grip on the armed
forces. Mr Walesa sought the support of top army leaders to remove Admiral
Piotr Kolodziejczyk, a one-time ally and former Warsaw Pact admiral, from
the post of defence minister.
The president saw his generals, led by General Tadeusz Wilecki, the chief of
staff, as allies against the minister because of their unhappiness over
continuing military spending cuts. Mr Kolodziejczyk resisted the attempt to
sideline him, but the move has precipitated a political crisis over control
of the 200,000-strong army. It has attracted criticism of Mr Walesa in
parliament from Solidarity supporters and former communists, who united to
pass a resolution that his actions 'were endangering democracy'.
At the same time as Mr Walesa is coming under fire from his former allies,
there has been bitter in-fighting between the leaders of the uneasy
coalition government of former communists and peasant farmers, which is now
at the start of its second year in power.
Mr Kwasnieski is the senior partner in the coalition, his SLD party having
won most votes in the September 1993 general election. However, he has been
consistently frustrated and outclassed by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime
minister and leader of the Peasant party.
Mr Pawlak displays qualities of stubborn craftiness traditionally associated
with the peasantry in this still largely rural country of small private
farmers. While Mr Kwasniewcki has been supporting ideas for modernising
Poland, such as privatisation, Mr Pawlak has been dragging his heels and
concentrating on using power for the benefit of his peasant supporters.
This week, Mr Pawlak agreed to sign a bill to launch the long-stalled
privatisation programme - after months of insistent prodding by Mr
Kwasniewcki. But he agreed to sign only after securing concessions that take
several enterprises of interest to the rural sector out of the programme.
Mr Pawlak has also positioned his party as a suspicious watchdog over the
largely foreign-managed investment trusts that will manage the 460 or so
enterprises included in the programme. In so doing, he has upstaged the
ex-communists in pursuit of latent anti-capitalist voters.
The prospect of a bitter presidential contest and governmental in-fighting
does not appear to have had any impact on Poland's economic recovery and its
new found attractiveness for foreign investors thus far.
The government's proposal to limit the independence of the central bank  -
whose current governor was nominated by Mr Walesa - by creating an advisory
board nominated by politicians, is one worrying straw in the wind. It
reflects a conflict between the central bank's willingness to keep interest
rates high to counter inflation and the government's desire for cheaper
financing of the budget deficit.
But the recovery in Poland's export markets of Germany and the rest of the
European Union, growing trade with and financial inflows from Russia and
other former Soviet states, and strong domestic demand are combining to keep
up the growth which began in 1992. The economy is set to expand by 4.5 per
cent this year and next.
Industrial output rose by an extraordinary 13 per cent over the first nine
months of this year and growth was export-led. Exports increased 23 per cent
in this period to Dollars 10.7bn while import growth slowed to 7 per cent at
Dollars 11bn.
Rapid growth and higher real incomes carry some risk of over-heating,
however. Inflation accelerated in the third quarter, causing prices over the
first nine months to rise by 32 per cent on the same period of 1993.
But money supply and the budget deficit for this year are both within the
limits agreed in the summer with the International Monetary Fund as part of
negotiations over a loan to help reduce Poland's commercial debt. Next
year's draft budget with a planned deficit of 3.3 per cent of GDP appears
achievable. Inflation next year, according to the Finance Ministry, should
be about 23 per cent, down from the 31 per cent forecast for 1994 as a
whole.
Meanwhile the prime minister's go-ahead for the mass privatisation programme
will allow the the IMF to disburse funds promised to help finance the first
payment of Dollars 1.9bn in the Dollars 14bn London Club debt reduction deal
finalised last month. The IMF had earlier made clear that progress on
privatisation was a condition for releasing the funds.
The combination of debt reduction, IMF approval and mass privatisation is
expected to attract foreign fund managers to Warsaw to help the
privatisation programme. Their skills will be needed in setting up and
running the 20 National Investment Funds that will manage the privatised
enterprises on behalf of millions of Poles who have bought privatisation
vouchers.
Despite the risk of political storms in the months ahead, the improving
economic outlook should also be attractive to foreign banks and investors,
who have so far been reluctant to set down roots in Poland. Yet this
country, the first to overthrow communism, has also been the first to
restore macroeconomic stability and, for the past two years, one of the
fastest growing economies outside south-east Asia.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Unclean hands in France
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Corruption in France does not appear to have been of the systemic variety
revealed in Italy. The allegations of malpractice that have recently forced
the resignations of two French ministers are more reminiscent of cases
involving West German politicians during the 1970s and 1980s than those
affecting large numbers of government personnel and businessmen in Italy in
the past decade. And the latest evidence of malpractice within Britain's
conservative party indicates that sleaze is a Europe-wide phenomenon.
All the same, the steady flow of allegations of misdeeds by French
politicians and company executives has added to concern about low ethical
standards in public life in France, and this in turn has undermined the
credibility and effectiveness of Mr Edouard Balladur's conservative
government. A recent opinion poll indicated that 60 per cent of French
voters lacked confidence in Mr Balladur's ability to counter corruption. The
dents in the prime minister's image have set back his hitherto
smooth-running campaign to win the presidency in the election due next
spring.
Following last year's collapse of electoral support for the Socialist party,
partly as the result of revelations over abuse in collection of political
contributions, there is a risk that, as in Italy, the mainstream French
parties of left and right will end up squarely discredited by the taint of
scandal.
Fringe parties
These developments are most unlikely to create the form of political
upheaval seen in Italy. But they will strengthen support for fringe parties
ahead of the presidential election. And they may weaken France's voice in
the debate over the next stage of European integration, particularly
vis-a-vis newly re-elected Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
The electoral chances next spring of Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the
European commission and former Socialist finance minister, have been
heightened by Mr Balladur's problems. However, the 'clean hands' advantage
afforded by Mr Delors' 10 year absence from the French political scene may
be offset by the public perception of the Socialist party.
Anxieties about a lowering of France's international influence were almost
certainly in President Francois Mitterrand's mind yesterday when he rebuffed
recent suggestions in the French press about a threat to France's internal
stability. The crumbling of Mr Mitterrand's personal authority near the end
of his 14-year rule has no doubt added to the general sense of misgiving.
But the president was right to warn against premature condemnation of people
caught up in corruption investigations.
Exaggerated judgements
Some members of the French judiciary, emboldened by the high profile
activities of Italian magistrates, may have overstepped the mark in their
eagerness to publicise investigations into public figures. Exaggerated
judgments about a sudden rise in French corruption have also been encouraged
by a less forgiving climate in public opinion, itself influenced by what
ordinary people have had to put up with during the recession.
A range of unorthodox activities is now coming to the surface in diverse
French investigations. Even though some of the cases which are attracting
publicity date back to investigations started in the 1980s, important voices
from the French corporate world now appear to believe that French business
should clean up its act. Many of the cases focus on accusations that public
contracts have been used to divert funds illegally into party coffers.
Mr Balladur has bowed to public pressure by suggesting annual audits of the
assets of ministers, parliamentary deputies and senior functionaries, along
with external examination of public sector contracts. An outright ban on
private donations to political parties, proposed by some French politicians,
seems unlikely to be the right answer. Greatly increased transparency of the
finances of parties and individuals involved in public dealings is a
necessary condition for persuading French voters that the government's
campaign on corruption can be successful.
These are the kinds of reform which are needed elsewhere as well.

Michael Heseltine, in his role as Britain's trade supremo, is currently in
Malaysia, doing a bit of bridge building after the lifting of Malaysia's ban
on government contracts to British companies.
Among the sights are two 85- storey towers, being built in Kuala Lumpur's
city centre; the Malaysians say they will be the world's tallest. Britain's
trade and industry secretary was impressed. Apparently the development
reminded him very much of London's Canary Wharf project.
Given the terrific problems Canary Wharf has gone through, hardly the most
tactful of remarks. Or maybe he was being deviously ironic?

As Russia's President Yeltsin ponders more unrest among his ministers, he
must occasionally cast envious glances at the growing business career of his
predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev.
Gorbachev is currently starring in a German ad campaign for Apple Computer
and features as a fearfully busy pin-striped executive who will not accept
anything but the very best when buying computers for his Green Cross
International environmental organisation. 'The more freedom Mikhail
Gorbachev has in his work, the better,' purs the glossy advertisement.
For his part, Gorby says: 'One is either part of the solution or part of the
problem. I decided on the first.'
Presumably he is talking about his computer rather than his abbreviated
political career.

Very sorry I can't hand out your school prizes - I've got to hot-foot it

aeroplanes and steam engines were invented in Russia in the 16th century.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are two ways of looking at the news that Robert MacNeil - known as
Robin - is retiring next year after two decades as co-anchor of the
MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour, US non-commercial television's admirable weekday
fix on current affairs.
Both are sad. Canadian-born MacNeil, long ago a BBC veteran, and his
sidekick, Jim Lehrer, an affable Texan and spare-time thriller-writer, have
been continuing voices of sanity amidst increasingly shrill news
broadcasting. Their nightly audience - about 2m - is full of policy movers,
shakers and wannabees who know that being interviewed by one or the other
means recognition.
MacNeil, who insists he always intended to retire on the programme's 20th
anniversary, which is also close to his 65th birthday, will not be replaced.
Lehrer, the safest pair of hands, will shoulder the whole burden, with help
from sub-anchors.
Behind the decision lies another sad fact about the parlous state of public
TV's finances. The New York end of the programme, from which MacNeil
operated, will be closed down next year, with production confined to
Washington, Lehrer's base. This is a large blow to WNET, Channel 13, in New
York.
It also leaves Jim Lehrer with the problem of finding a new sign-off line,
when 'Goodnight, Robin' becomes history.

More funny goings on in the Lloyd's of London insurance bazaar, where gossip
of rifts between chairman David Rowland and his chief executive, Peter
Middleton, continues to flare up despite repeated denials.
The suspicion at the insurance market's Lime Street headquarters that a few
angry Lloyd's Names are trying to cause mischief by spreading rumours has
credibility - after all, Lloyd's is turning the screws on thousands of
lossmaking members who owe it money. But would they get involved in burgling
the chief executive's mansion? As Middleton should know, that sort of thing
only happens in spy thrillers.

Everybody knows the Pope has friends in high places, but his terrestrial
contacts aren't bad either. For it was a veritable roll-call of Italy's
industrial, judicial, religious and political potentates who gathered on
Wednesday evening for the launch of his book, Crossing the Threshold of
Hope.
Arch-conservative Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger and Irene Pivetti, the devout
Catholic speaker of Italy's lower house of parliament, made the formal
presentation.
Sitting humbly in the front row was Cesare Romiti, chief executive of Fiat,
flanked either side by archbishops; Gherardo Colombo, one of Milan's
anti-corruption magistrates, was placed just behind.
Most prominent absentee - apart from the pontiff himself - was Silvio
Berlusconi, who was otherwise engaged in Rome. His actress wife Veronica was
present, however - as was the Italian prime minister in spirit, by dint of
the vast reach of his commercial empire.
Rushing to the aid of Mrs Berlusconi, whose arrival nearly caused a bout of
fisticuffs between greedy hacks and photographers, were Berlusconi staff
from Mondadori, publishers of the book, assiduously shielding her from the
attentions of employees from another part of the group, Fininvest's three
television channels.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Personal View: A partial cure for Italy's deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCO MODIGLIANI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In its triennial economic and financial plan, published at the end of
September, the Berlusconi government ac-knowledged Italy's continuing fiscal
problems and announced the broad outlines of a cure.
In the absence of any corrective action, the budget deficit, it was
estimated, would increase from L160,000bn in 1994 (or some Dollars 100bn) -
resulting in a mammoth ratio of debt to gross domestic product of 123 per
cent - to L200,000bn, and 134 per cent of GDP, in 1997. The plan called for
new measures to bring the deficit down to L100,000bn by 1997, the target set
by the previous Ciampi government. The reduction of L100,000bn was to be
accomplished by a cut of L45,000bn in 1995, with further cuts of L55,000bn
over the following two years.
The details of the first year's programme were revealed when the government
submitted the long-awaited 1995 budget to parliament at the end of
September. So far, it has been fairly favourably received by Italian and
foreign commentators. The main reason seems to be that the programme is more
austere than was expected from the electoral programme and earlier
utterances of the parties in government.
It also satisfies the targets set out in the three-year plan to reduce the
deficit by L50,000bn. And L28,000bn, or more than half, of that reduction is
supposed to come from expenditure cuts.
Another feature that contributed to the favourable judgment is that the
budget was accompanied by wise and courageous proposals to reform the
pension system. Existing laws passed before 1991 by governments in search of
votes had given irresponsibly favourable treatment to the retired. This,
together with the large share of the expensive National Medical Insurance
System borne by the government, threatened to absorb an unsupportable
portion of national income.
The proposals gradually shift the Italian pension system towards those of
other countries in the European Union.
The rest of the budget, however, suffers from several significant
shortcomings.
To begin with, the assertion that the deficit reduction will come primarily
from pruning expenditure rests on an arbitrary and unacceptable
classification of individual items, including some questionable ones.
Far more serious is that L19,000bn, or some 40 per cent of the deficit
reduction, will come from payments made in exchange for an amnesty for a
variety of transgressions of laws and regulations. These include tax evasion
and the violation of building codes.
Such sources of revenue are not new to Italy, but they have never been used
to such a degree. They are immoral in that they reward illegal behaviour; in
the long run, they are self-defeating, since they encourage such behaviour.
Furthermore they cannot be regarded as ordinary income, since they represent
the liquidation of an asset - the claims against the violators. They are
therefore transitory and will have to be replaced by more permanent measures
next year (though the government estimates that some of the proposed
measures may reduce tax evasion in future).
Other measures are similarly transitory, such as the postponement of the
inflation adjustment on pensions.
Finally, there is some concern about the reliability of the estimate of
savings of L50,000bn. The estimate of interest costs is likely to be too
optimistic and the revenue from amnesties is uncertain and easily
overestimated.
The deficit reduction is thus unlikely to be as effective as planned,
largely because it will be achieved by questionable and transitory means.
The actual, permanent reduction will probably be less than L30,000bn,
requiring savings of another L70,000bn in the next two years, an annual
average higher than that of 1994.
This is a tall order but not impossible. The economy is strong and growing
rapidly.
Achieving the cuts, however, requires prompt and intensive attention. The
government must devote itself to re-establishing its credibility.
It must use its continuing popularity to prepare Italians for the painful
sacrifices and unpopular measures that await them. Only by such actions can
it convince financial markets of the seriousness of its commitment to carry
out its obligations. Only thus can it begin to reduce the huge premium of
Italian interest rates over world interest rates, which threatens to
suffocate the economic recovery.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's Budget task
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke will be discussing the European Union's fiscal position in
Italy today, not the UK Budget. Treasury ministers and advisers will not
plot the Budget strategy in Dorneywood without him, but some would say there
was little need for them to meet at all. In the spirit of his new precept
that 'sound economics is good politics', Mr Clarke has already ruled out
significant tax cuts for this year, while the good performance of the
economy this year rules out any further tax increases.
But there is more to a 'sound' Budget, especially a unified one, than the
fall or rise of headline tax rates. In his second Budget speech, the
chancellor should set himself the task of explaining and illustrating this,
not merely to the electorate, but to his party.
The chancellor believes that the government can rebuild its popularity only
on the basis of a revived reputation for economic competence. In his first
Budget, that meant a willingness to imitate his predecessor's last Budget,
by raising taxes to plug the hole in the public finances. There is still
plenty of red ink on the public sector accounts. But a series of pleasant
economic surprises means that the gap between the politically popular and
the economically prudent is a good deal narrower than it was last November.
Position reversed
According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the public sector borrowing
requirement for 1994-95 is likely to be under Pounds 32bn, some Pounds 6bn
lower than the prediction in last year's Budget. The reasons can be found in
what has happened to the components of nominal GDP growth, which is itself
likely to come out only slightly lower than the 6.5 per cent expected a year
ago. Last November, the Treasury expected that only 2.5 percentage points
would represent real growth in GDP, with the remainder taken up by
inflation. In the event, the position of the two has been reversed:
inflation for fiscal year 1994-95 may be only 2.5 per cent, while real GDP
growth could well exceed 3.5 per cent.
The chancellor will find it easy to sound tough on public spending,
announcing a reduction in the overall level for the second consecutive year.
Last year's nominal spending targets have been undershot, without any
reduction in the volume of public services. Indeed, the IFS has calculated
that if the chancellor were to adhere to last year's planned real reduction
in spending for next year, the revised nominal control total for 1995-96
unveiled in five weeks could be Pounds 5bn less than previously planned.
Shrink faster
This year at least, Mr Clarke should also be able to silence those in his
party calling for tax cuts. A higher rate of economic growth in 1994 means
that the economy will return to its trend level of output somewhat earlier
than previously thought. Accordingly, public borrowing ought to shrink
faster than planned over the coming years, in order to keep demand in check.
Even the more pessimistic analysts, however, envisage the PSBR falling to
very low levels - perhaps 1 - 2 per cent of GDP - by 1997. In that context,
the pressure for voter-friendly tax cuts can be expected to be far greater
next year. Mr Clarke is unlikely to extinguish those hopes in his coming
speech. But the message of the 1994 Budget should be somewhat deeper.
The chancellor should seek to establish a micro-economic counterpart to the
framework for stable macro-economic policy which has been put in place since
sterling's exit from the ERM. That means clearly laying out, not merely the
level of tax and spending for the years ahead, but his plans for their
structure as well.
After the many new measures imposed in the last three Budgets, Mr Clarke
should hold off dramatic change, and certainly he should lose his penchant
for gimmickry. An end to 'boom and bust', for monetary policy, means early
interest rate increases and transparent dealings between central bank
governor and chancellor. Similarly, on the fiscal side, it means prior
warning that the tax cuts, should they prove feasible, will be aimed at
improving, first, the treatment of savings and investment and, second, the
relationship between the tax and benefit systems. Mr Clarke should become a
reformer. That would be sound economics, indeed.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Civil service needs improvement, but
not by killing it off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('Re-engineering the Treasury', October 20) touched on one
of the most important, but least highlighted, elements of the Treasury's
cuts announcement - the threat to the notion of an independent UK civil
service.
Regardless of the failings of the Treasury - which are in any event largely
failings of government economic policy - the Fundamental Expenditure Review
has a much wider purpose than simply improving the Treasury's strategic
vision.
In part it represents the political equivalent of scuttling the fleet before
it is captured by the enemy navy. The Treasury cuts will seriously damage a
future government's attempts to use the public sector and public expenditure
in a more positive way.
It is also part of the broader objective of restructuring the shape of
central government in the UK. It signals the acceleration of the long-term
rundown in numbers of civil servants which, together with the break-up of
departments into saleable executive agencies, privatisation and contracting
out, threatens the very existence of a non-political, independent civil
service.
Importing inappropriate private sector methods into the public service,
without regard for the uniqueness of much public service work or the need
for transparent accountability, has already done a great deal of damage.
Contracting out and privatisation have also created new problems of quality
and accountability which are only just beginning to emerge with a spate of
scandals over the last year.
This is about to be aggravated with back-door attempts to politicise the
service through personal contracts at senior level (what price independent
advice then?) and half-baked ideas about linking performance pay to policy
work. The British civil service needs improvement in many ways, but this
government believes that effectively killing it off represents such an
improvement. Unless ministers change their views, this will prove a costly
mistake.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Conservatives are driving corruption down-market. The traditional
British way of trading favours is camouflaged, subtle, delicate, unspoken,
communicated via the old boy network, nudged along and winked through,
understood but never admitted, modest, restricted to a small circle of
villains who trust one another, above all manageable. The essence of it is a
pretence that it never happens here. The Italians and latterly the French
may be corrupt, we tell ourselves, but sleaze stops at Calais.
This myth has enabled officials to protest that British standards of public
life are the highest in the world, the envy of the universe, a model
followed with difficulty even in the celestial kingdom. Mr David Hunt, the
minister for open government, was saying that sort of thing yesterday,
popping up on the airwaves every hour, wearing an expression perfected by
purveyors of double glazing. Wide-eyed and innocent, he was apparently
possessed of a touching expectation that he was convincing. He was not. Nor
was Mr John Major when he uttered similar sentiments in the Commons.
To be fair, the prime minister did not stand a chance. British corruption is
getting out of hand. Mr Major himself is seen to be honest, but all around
him the angels and seraphim of his Tory administration are falling. Down
they flutter, wings torn or singed, into the abyss of resignation, sacking,
disgrace. We need not list them. They have been punished enough. The Artful
Dodger will not rise to the heights to which he aspires. The Outlaws have
been banished. The honourable member for back-handers and his colleague, the
ex-minister for nice little earners, have attracted the opprobrium they
deserve.
It is the imps who may still be sailing aloft singing hosannas and
pretending to be perfect who should trouble Mr Major. He cannot know how
many more miscreants will be found, or who they are. What concerns him is
that the public perceives that there is something fishy about some members
of his 15-year-old government. Just the other day 61 per cent of respondents
to a Gallup poll in the Daily Telegraph agreed that the Tories 'give the
impression of being very sleazy and disreputable'. What proportion does Mr
Major imagine thinks like that this morning? The public has lost confidence
in the probity of his party, and with reason.
Recall the facts. Questionable traders have donated large sums to the
Tories. Patronage is for sale, at a somewhat higher price than parliamentary
questions. Yesterday Mr George Howarth, a Labour MP, published a table
naming 157 business executives appointed to the boards of 100 quangos; all
seem to have ties with companies that have contributed to Conservative
funds. Ministers who have supervised the privatisation of state industries
have become directors of the new firms, or moved to the banks that handled
the sales. The most startling allegations have arisen from arms deals.
Earlier this year, evidence given in public to Lord Justice Scott's inquiry
into some of these was disquieting enough; his report could be more so.
Ministers are dangerously complacent about this. One said privately last
week that so much time had passed in the waiting that Scott had gone stale.
We shall see.
While officials reassure themselves, Mr Tony Blair seizes the moment. At
question time yesterday, the new leader of the Labour party made three
suggestions. The first - that no minister who has privatised a company
should subsequently end up on its board - was rejected by the prime
minister. The second - that 'a list of all members of quangos, their
payments, their perks and any position with any political party' be
published - was parried by Mr Major, who said his own studies were under
way. The third - that 'the cash for questions inquiry now be broadened, be
made deeper, be held in public and be made fully independent' was turned
down on the ground that Parliament's committee on privileges had
traditionally taken evidence in private. It would publish its report, which
would be debated.
None of this is good enough. The rules for ministerial behaviour, both in
office and after leaving it, manifestly need tightening. Only an
independent, open inquiry will be enough to meet the level of public
suspicion aroused by the revelation that MPs have been paid to ask
parliamentary questions. One junior minister resigned yesterday following
allegations to that effect in The Guardian; a second, Mr Major informed the
House, is suing the newspaper. That may bring the whole subject into court,
a more open form of inquisition than Parliament's committee of privileges.
As to quangos, we can wait and see what the government proposes to do.
The prime minister should not dally. He would do well to recall the posture
adopted by the sensible Mr Kenneth Clarke in analogous circumstances. When
he became chancellor, the government's economic strategy, blown away on
Black Wednesday, was in ruins. The markets had little confidence in the
Tories' economic competence; the voters less. The priority, Mr Clarke
determined, was to restore faith in Conservative prudence. Tax cuts could
wait. If necessary, interest rates could be increased. What the chancellor
called a period of good government was the best - the only - political
strategy if the Conservatives were to avoid defeat at the next general
election. By giving the Bank of England quasi-independent control over
monetary policy, he locked the government in to his chosen course. Mr Major
doubtless concurred.
The parallel is clear. Public confidence in the probity of Conservatives
will not be restored unless Mr Major demonstrates that he regards the
establishment of clean government as an overriding medium-term priority. All
his political actions should recognise this. He should have welcomed Mr
Blair's proposals, and added a gloss of his own. The prime minister must
take risks. He should place allegations of improper behaviour, or inquiries
into new rules, before independent tribunals or committees. These must
conduct their deliberations in the open. As Mr Paddy Ashdown said yesterday
'neither this House nor the people of this country are going to be satisfied
with the result of inquiries held in secret'. Heaven knows what may emerge
from public investigations but, as to that, it is too late for regrets.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Six steps to untether trade: Kim Chul-su, candidate to head
the WTO, outlines his priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIM CHUL-SU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to be objective about a process in which one has been so
closely involved. But I think it is fair to say that the Uruguay Round of
trade negotiations, and the World Trade Organisation to which it gave birth,
will be seen by historians as one of mankind's most valuable achievements.
Eighty years after the start of the first world war ended a century of
relative peace and rising prosperity, the principles of free trade advocated
by the great 19th century liberal thinkers are gaining near universal
acceptance. Both the idea of free trade and its institutional expression can
no longer be seen as part of an ideological arsenal - or indeed as a means
whereby an affluent 'north' seeks to exploit an impoverished 'south'.
Recent experience shows that a worldwide free trade system can provide
developing countries with a fast track to economic development if they can
stay the course and avoid doctrinal detours.
But developed nations are no less dependent on free trade for their
continued economic progress. The contribution of trade to economic growth in
the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development has been steadily rising and this trend will continue.
For the world as a whole, international commerce acts as a powerful
integrating mechanism. It exerts a humanising influence on politics, culture
and social life. In the 21st century, I believe it could form the basis of a
new global civilisation, characterised by the peaceful interplay of
competition and co-operation.
That, in short, is why the WTO is so important. And yet the outcome of the
Uruguay Round was a close-run thing. At several points, the process of
reaching agreement almost ground to a halt - most notably at the 1990
Brussels ministerial meeting. Even now, six months after the final Uruguay
accord was signed in Marrakesh and less than three months before the
scheduled launch of the WTO on January 1, some 90 contracting parties to the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have yet to complete their internal
ratification procedures.
Clearly, the first director-general of the WTO will be more than just
'present at the creation', in the memorable phrase of former US secretary of
state Dean Acheson. The organisation will doubtless bear the impress of his
professional style, modus operandi and personal philosophy for many years to
come.
He will, unavoidably, be called upon to set precedents that will guide his
successors and help chart the future direction of the WTO. Therefore, I
believe that any candidate for this post has an obligation publicly to state
which tasks he would accord the highest priority. In my view, there are six:
First, expediting completion of the unfinished business of the Uruguay
Round. This in-cludes negotiations in the services sector and new issues for
further market liberalisation.
Second, promoting expansion of the organisation to ensure that it becomes a
truly universal institution. The admission of China, Russia and some 20
other prospective members will create a unified, worldwide multilateral
trading system for the first time in history. I hope that the most populous
of these countries - China - will be a Gatt signatory soon, in time to
become a charter member of the WTO.
Third, ensuring that the benefits of the Uruguay Round accrue to all WTO
members, irrespective of size, region or developmental status. In the past,
developing nations have often felt that their interests were not adequately
represented in the Gatt. The Uruguay Round was the first time the developing
world took an active part in the Gatt round. The WTO, by combating
protectionism and fairly enforcing trade rules, can help narrow the gap in
living standards between developed and developing countries.
Fourth, strengthening the rule of law in the international trading order
through effective utilisation of the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism.
This major reform denies the parties to a dispute the effective veto over a
settlement that they had under the Gatt. As a result, the WTO should be able
to resolve trade disputes faster and more fairly and effectively. Indeed,
the credibility of the WTO will depend to a great extent on how well it
meets these expectations.
Fifth, co-ordinating the work of the WTO with that of the World Bank and the
IMF. The original proposal at Bretton Woods to establish an 'International
Trade Organisation' to complement the Fund and the bank was never realised.
Now, 50 years later, the WTO will fill the gap. The mandates of all three
overlap and interface at so many points that a high degree of co-ordination
is needed if each is to yield maximum benefits.
Sixth, preparing the ground for dealing with trade-related issues that go
beyond market access. At the front of the queue is the question of trade and
the environment, for which a committee has already been set up within the
Gatt. Other issues brought forward by some members include the relationships
between trade and subjects such as competition policy, investment and labour
standards.
I think it is essential to recognise that these issues are complex and do
not admit of easy, black-and-white solutions. All involve trade-offs and
value conflicts over which reasonable men and women may surely differ. That
is why our first task in dealing with them should be to acquire a sufficient
basis of scholarship and research to enable us to discuss these issues
intelligently.
During its 50 years of existence, the Gatt achieved enormous success in
reducing tariffs and opening markets. More than any other institution, it
has shaped today's global economy.
However, it was not without structural defects, and its potential was
limited by the fact that it could operate on only one side of an ideological
frontier. Moreover, during its last decade or so, the Gatt system seemed
increasingly hard-pressed to deal with the rising challenges of
protectionism, regionalism and unilateralism.
The WTO was designed to avoid the defects and weaknesses of its predecessor.
And the end of the cold war has eliminated the barrier to a globally
inclusive membership.
Thus the auspices look favourable for the inauguration of the WTO on January
1. This is the kind of opportunity for mankind that comes along rarely in
history. It is one that, both literally and figuratively, we cannot afford
to squander.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER CAVE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a result of the Financial Services Act, financial advisers and sales
people must declare to would-be investors exactly whom they represent and
(from the new year) the commissions they will receive in cash terms.
Given the continuing concern over cash for questions, perhaps MPs should
follow a similar line. Before their questions are accepted, their speeches
allowed and their parliamentary votes counted, perhaps they should make it
clear at the time exactly whose interests they are representing and the
financial rewards they have or will receive.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: CSO figures on UK consultants'
overseas earnings too gloomy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr T A BOAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was disappointed to read the article in which the Central Statistical
Office reports a fall in 1993 in the overseas earnings by consultants
('Overseas earnings by consultants fall', October 15).
The CSO report paints a somewhat gloomy picture of consultancy which, from
our viewpoint, is far from true. More than 80 per cent of member firms
reported that their overall work load overseas in 1993 was higher than or
the same as in 1992, and 97 per cent expect their work load to be higher or
the same in 1994.
British consultancy internationally is a success story and is highly
regarded by international funding agencies. With a multiplier effect for
project work of 10-25 this is good news for British business as a whole.
From our annual statistical survey of member firms, which are the leading
consultancy firms working internationally, we believe the gross overseas
earnings of British consultants in 1993 were higher than reported,
particularly for consulting engineers where the figure is Pounds 684m
compared with the CSO figure of Pounds 397m, including process engineers.
Our returns also show a different regional emphasis, with Asia and Pacific
the biggest market with 41 per cent of gross earnings. The European Union
came third with 16 per cent.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Number of omissions in government's
'rosy' view of its immigration policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM ALLEN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The letter by Nicholas Baker, immigration minister, (October 20)
contains a number of omissions in its rosy portrait of the Conservatives'
immigration and asylum policy. He says that detention powers under the 1971
Immigration Act 'are exercised only when there are good grounds for
believing that the person will not comply with any conditions imposed, if
released'. What he fails to point out is that the decision to detain is made
without reference or accountability to any independent review body.
That such decisions are left to the discretion of immigration officers with
no or little grounding in human rights and foreign affairs is a situation
which needs to be remedied.
Not one of the 50 detainees who were the subject of Amnesty International's
report was given full written explanations of their rights and how to
exercise them. How can the minister claim that Britain 'complies with its
obligation under international conventions to which it is a signatory' when
international standards require that all detainees be fully informed of
their rights and how to use them? This begs the question of whether
immigration officials making these decisions are actually themselves aware
of the rights of detainees?
Mr Baker further claims that: 'Detention is a necessary part of a policy of
firm and fair immigration control.' This slogan might be passable if
detention were to occur in a humanitarian manner. Unfortunately it does not.
How can the Home Office justify the fact that more than one third of all
those detained are held in prisons and can be treated far worse than the
common criminal charged with a serious offence? Surely detention ought to
take place in recognised and properly equipped detention centres?
Labour would seek to adopt a fairer system so that detention was used only
in the most pressing circumstances as an absolute last resort. We would also
ensure that detainees were treated humanely and given their due rights in
line with the UK's international and European commitments. This would
include a known limit to the length of time for which detainees could be
held and special attention to the physical and mental health of detainees.
Ahead of the UK introducing a bill of rights, there is much that could be
done to ensure that people desperately fleeing from persecution in their own
land are given safe haven if they escape to Britain. Fair treatment requires
a government that takes its human rights responsibilities seriously.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your report, 'Merseyside union official steps down' (October 20), on
the resignation of Mr Alan Quinn from the T&amp;G's executive quotes Mr Quinn as
claiming that the union accepts that the published figure for his expenses
is inaccurate.
This is not, in fact, the case. Attention was drawn to Mr Quinn's expenses
following the publication in the union journal, as now required by law, of
the amounts claimed over the past year by himself and all other members of
our lay executive.
Mr Quinn asserted that the published figure was untrue, as a result of which
an inquiry was established to ascertain the position.
This investigation has established that the figure published for payments
made to Mr Quinn is, in fact, accurate. There is no question of the T&amp;G's
financial officer having accepted that the published expenses figure for Mr
Quinn of Pounds 15,181 is 'inaccurate and not true'.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: All hell breaks loose at the Paris 'Ring' - Covent
Garden has no monopoly of booing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN at The Chatelet
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If only Eurotunnel had started passenger services a month earlier. Then
opera-goers could have amused themselves last weekend travelling back and
forth between London and Paris, watching new productions of Wagner's Ring in
the two cities getting booed to the rafters.
There was no way that Covent Garden had a monopoly of discontent. Although
the first three instalments of the Theatre du Chatelet's new Ring cycle had
passed off peacefully, that was because the producer had chosen not to
appear. When he did finally poke his nose out from behind the curtain at the
end of Gotterdammerung on Sunday, all hell broke loose. They booed, they
whistled, they screamed abuse.
What it is that makes audiences at Wagner's operas want to taste blood?
Leaving aside the cost of the tickets, doubtless a powerful incentive, the
main problem is the impossibility of realising the composer's stage
instructions. Having giving up the realistic style by the 1960s and then
exhausted all manner of social and political updatings in the 1970s and
1980s, producers are looking for somewhere else to go.
The Royal Opera's new Ring is cartoon-colourful and disrespectful, in a
style which is starting to be accepted as 'post-modern'. Pierre Strosser,
the producer in Paris, has gone to the other extreme. His stage picture is
unrelievedly grey: grey costumes on a grey stage against a grey backdrop. In
sweeping aside the outdated ideas of the last couple of decades, he has
sought to put precisely nothing in their place. No message, no analysis or
re-interpretation. Worse - there is no intelligence, no emotion, nothing to
make one feel that sitting through the Ring for 16 hours should send one out
a different person from when one went in.
To anybody following the Chatelet Ring from the beginning, none of this
should have come as a surprise. Earlier in the year Das Rheingold and Die
Walkure had already set the course that the cycle - a co-production between
the Chatelet and Radio France, which perhaps explains the emphasis on
musical over visual values - was to follow.
Although the rough and ready playing of the Orchestre National de France was
not one of the cycle's strong points, Jeffrey Tate did succeed in overcoming
underlying orchestral weakness to deliver performances of thoroughly
Wagnerian power and grandeur. Siegfried was solid and leaden-footed in a way
typical of Tate when inspiration deserts him, but Gotterdammerung revived
enthusiasm with bursts of passionate energy, flushing hot and cold, now
slow, now racingly fast.
In Paris, Tate's appearances at the second half of this Ring have taken on a
new significance. Rumour has it that he may be asked to take over the hot
seat of international opera, as music director at the Bastille in succession
to Myung-Whun Chung. If it comes about, his appointment would fan other
flames: the Chatelet and the Bastille are firm rivals.
Where the Chatelet production invested its money wisely was in its choice of
singers. Presumably the logic was that if most of the audience was following
the performances at home on the radio, there should be good voices to listen
to. In Siegfried, Robert Hale was outstanding, a sovereign Wanderer, proudly
proclaiming a noble Wagnerian bass-baritone to the world. In
Gotterdammerung, Kurt Rydl made a hardly less impressive counterpart,
black-voiced, burly, a Hagen born to lower-class thuggery.
The Siegfried and Brunnhilde also had their vocal strengths. Heinz Kruse may
be getting on for 50, short and rather podgy, but he sings as if the role
holds no particular difficulties for him, as fresh at the end of Siegfried
as he was at the beginning (though it is not a very heroic tenor voice).
Towering above him was the 6ft Gabriele Schnaut, just as steady vocally and
astonishingly loud, but not, sadly, a moving Brunnhilde, mostly because the
voice is so hard and inexpressive. Much amusement was to be had during the
love duet in Siegfried watching these ill-matched lovers trying to avoid
standing side by side.
Among the other vocal pleasures were a singularly well-sung Gunther from
Eike Wilm Schulte, Franz-Josef Kappellmann as a strong Alberich and a
winningly-blended trio of Rhinemaidens in Julie Kaufmann, Hanna Schaer and
Dagmar Peckova. Malmfrid Sand was clearly trying to create a character out
of Gutrune, which was unusual in the context of this production, where stand
and sing was not just tolerated but encouraged as the way to play the Ring.
In addition, the programme for Gotterdammerung listed 45 'figurants' or
'extras', who turned out to be a long crocodile of men in raincoats who
filed on from one side of the stage and filed off again on the other a
couple of minutes later. Nobody could explain who they were meant to be, but
they must have added a penny or two to the Chatelet's production budget. It
might have been more cost-effective to pay them to applaud from the stalls
at the end.

cycles of the Ring follow later in October and November

FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: The Broken Heart - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Marital discord, overpowering jealousy, eating disorders, the future of the
ruling dynasty . . .I refer, of course, to - what else? - the 1633 tragedy
The Broken Heart. Its author, John Ford, is better known for 'Tis Pity She's
A Whore; but by some strange chance this year has already seen two London
fringe productions of The Broken Heart, and now the Royal Shakespeare
Company is presenting it at the Swan.
The director, Michael Boyd, tells the excessively complex story with
astounding clarity. And the story, albeit complex, is actually the great
strength of The Broken Heart. I have called it a tragedy, but it only
intermittently starts to compel any pity or fear. What it is chiefly, is
full-bloodied melodrama of proto-Romantic type: the dark, tormented, Byronic
hero Orgilus, alienated from society and from virtue because his beloved
Penthea has been married by her brother Ithocles to another man; the
suffering Penthea, martyred by her brother's action and by the crazy
jealousy of her husband, Baffanes, until she is driven mad.
It is a revenge tragedy, but it ends by transcending revenge. Heartbreak has
been widespread among the cast, but we are unprepared for the final breaking
of a heart that gives the play its title. And the princess Calantha, who has
been a minor character hitherto, reveals a tragic authority that lifts us,
at the end of the play, into awe.
Like the plot, the language is full of striking effects which are more
exciting than revealing. But that seldom bothered me while I was watching
this production; and the role I had thought the most unplayable, the jealous
Baffanes, becomes here in Philip Voss's performance, the most rounded and
imaginative character of all.
Voss, indeed, is emerging as the master-actor of the Stratford season. (His
Menenius is the most multi-faceted character in the current Coriolanus.) He
knows how to make Baffanes's jealously both ridiculous and dismaying. And
how - only an instant later - to show the remorse and love that redeem the
man. ('Light of beauty,' he exclaims, looking up from the floor to his wife,
'deal not ungently with a dreadful world,'). In movement and in speech, he
brings abundant detail to the role, and makes him always convincing.
Iain Glen, who plays Orgilus, has the same lack of stillness that marred his
otherwise fine Henry V. His head, in particular, keeps moving during every
line he speaks; and his voice adds unnecessary motion to his lines - with
rises and falls and extra stresses that lend unmeaning decoration to his
role. Too bad, since Orgilus's dark thoughts are the still centre of the
play. In other respects, Glen's performance is excellently fresh,
intelligent, urgent. But this is an actor of great gifts, who has not yet
relaxed to discover the authority that could make him outstanding.
Emma Fielding, as Penthea, is quite the opposite. This young actress has, in
bearing and voice, stillness, authority, poise; and she has learnt a
tellingly cleaner attack into words and phrases. Her stillness here has the
same radiant pathos that it had, earlier this year, in Moliere's School for
Wives at the Almeida, but here the radiance is of anguished, vigilant
virtue. Her voice, based in an ever-developing contralto of rare firmness,
has wonderfully touching accents and phrases. Her Penthea is planned out,
scene by scene, with somewhat too much calculation; and the steady, slow
walk (which reveals her repressed but incessant grief) becomes, for all its
beauty, a shtick. Even so, this young actress is already a star.
Several other roles are played with not quite all their power they deserve,
but I note that both Robert Bowman (Ithocles) and Olivia Williams (Calantha)
are young RSC actors who are gaining in accomplishment and force. Tom
Piper's dreadful scenery with its clanking metal curtains should be replaced
immediately, but his Jacobean costumes are handsome. One masterstroke occurs
near the end, when the Princess leads a wedding-dance (choreographed by
Janet Smith) that moves briskly while Craig Armstrong's slow music gives it
no rhythmic support at all. The effect is eerie, and prepares us brilliantly
for what will follow.
In repertory at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon.

Channel 4 has turned Friday into 'Make Fun Of The Froggies' evening. In
Paris Alexei Sayle plays an artist in the 1920s who likes to paint chocolate
box pictures. He drops his breakfast and a lot of paint on the floor and the
resulting mess brings him fame and the adoration of the avant garde. Not
what you'd call subtle, but Sayle never needed subtlety to make us laugh.
Today he chaperones the sons of a famous art critic so that Valerie can
indulge in the craze for suicide (9.30). Eurotrash is the magazine programme
presented by Antoine de Caunes and Jean-Paul Gaultier which hunts down the
sleazy, the vulgar and the batty, not only in France, but across the entire
Disunited States Of Europe. Today we are told we shall meet Andro, an ex
puppeteer from Berlin who has become an expert in 'tantric sex' and now
hosts his own nude chat show and Spanish film director Bigas Luna talking
about his latest venture (11.10). In Favourite Films (9.30) Scorsese names
his desert island movies, including the 1946 Western Duel In The Sun which
is screened at 12.15 (both BBC2).

FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: Delusions of dance - Clement Crisp reviews Momix
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Momix is the name of a cattle-food. It is also the name given by Moses
Pendleton to the group of five gymnasts he directs, who are offered to the
world as dancers. The word 'choreography' is used in the programme to
describe their little numbers. The words 'dance', 'illusion', 'satire' are
found in their publicity. I would venture that the satire lies in their
illusion that they dance.
I saw Momix on Wednesday night at Sadler's Wells as a ten day season got
under way. I did not see all the programme, finding it impossible to remain
for the latter part of Passion, their chief offering, since by then Momix'
activities had induced symptoms I associate with having eaten a spoiled
oyster. So my comments relate to about two-thirds of the evening. It may be
that, thereafter, blazing theatrical genius fired the event. It may also be
that the members of Momix (2m; 3f) are Equerries and Ladies in Waiting to
the Queen of Peru.
The programme offers gymnastic exploits and a few skimpy costumes - stretch
fabric - in brief scenas of unfathomable purpose. One man exercises on a
table; three girls do a Page Three with balloons; someone is involved with a
rope, which gives the audience a chance to giggle. Bodies assume shapes
curious but far from intriguing. The accompaniment is rock blare.
One number, Alan Boeding's Circle Walker is memorably revived from a
previous visit. Boeding has made a handsome structure which is a metal
circle whose lower half is set at right angles to its upper part and joined
by curved struts. There results a sculptural and free-wheeling object inside
which Terry Pexton moves and poses. It is an imaginatively fascinating
concept. Pexton becomes an heroic figure, part Icarus as he stands high on
the circle's edge, part Sisyphus as he pushes it, both master and prisoner
of the wheel, and we see fascinating possibilities for dance and for
choreographic exploration of willed and involuntary momentum. It is grown-up
activity, a phrase I cannot use about the rest of the evening.
The show is, I'd hazard, ideal for those in their early 'teens. There is
relentless pop music, played before the performance and in the interval -
and also in the Wells' cafeteria. The performers have fine physiques, and
there is a topless moment to intrigue the younger lads. Passion, the main
item of the evening, has music of vast banality by Peter Gabriel, and, for
as long as I watched, was pointless - unless the sight of the cast bent in
half and clutching their buttocks was a message about the terrors of
haemorrhoids. Perhaps this was the satire we were promised by the
advertisements. It certainly wasn't the dance.
Momix is at Sadler's Wells until October 29.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Arts: The Queen and I - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From Leicester via a national tour and the Royal Court, Sue Townsend's
comedy has passed to the West End. As you must know, both the play and the
original 'novel' are about the present royal family, imagined as reduced by
a newly republican Britain to a grim council estate in Leicester. And why
not?
Ms Townsend chooses, however, not to explore many questions. I do not mean
that she ought to have explored any of them; only that her leaving them
untouched (why has the republic treated the royals so brutally? do they
learn anything significant in their exile? do their neighbours?) restricts
her play to a simple, homely vein in a never-never land.
The time of its notional future must be just weeks away, since the royals we
meet here have done nothing newly ridiculous since the ludicrous things we
think we know about already. Though there are mischievous little sallies
about those, none is followed up, and no character develops. For the guiding
premise is only this: wouldn't it be funny if the Queen and her clan were
stuck in a council estate?
Here I should declare a disability, from birth. All Brits, one gathers,
sometimes dream about meeting the Queen (often in unlikely circumstances,
but most often over tea) - even hard-Left Brits. That suggests that she
occupies a special place in your national dream-world, somewhere far beyond
ordinary assessment. When Ms Townsend brings her on to the stage in the
Celia Johnson-ish persona of Paula Wilcox, she comes ready-made as an icon;
you can then be titillated by hints of lese-majeste, and reminders of recent
'misconduct', and by the royals' supposed incomprehension of council-estate
demotic.
Those account for nearly all the comic substance of The Queen and I; those,
and a steady dribble of knowing references. For example, Prince Philip
insists on having his tea 'in my World Wildlife Fund mug]' Ha ha. Later the
Queen remarks that she has 'never met a butcher - except Bomber Harris, of
course.' Ha ha. But I liked the stuffed but lively corgi and the baby, both
in Spitting Image style.
Thanks to television, we expect stage-royal figures to be good
impersonators. Miss Wilcox makes a shy, engaging Queen, with glints of
something shyly aggressive. There is crepitating charm from Gillian Hanna's
Queen Mum (and Crawfie); David Horovitch's Philip is a testy but kindly soul
out of sit-com, and Toby Salaman's Charles a sympathetic, full-blooded
impersonation. Lizzy McInnerney's Di looks good, though the accent is more
striving-toward-Sloane-from-below than upper-class drooping Sloanewards;
Carole Hayman's Margaret is a creature from Noel Coward's stage milieu.
Pearce Quigley is outstandingly gormless as Prince William, two other chaps
and a Mrs Newman.
Their caricatured speech betrays scarcely any common ground, so we get no
sense of an aristocracy collectively at bay in an unfamiliar real world. In
Ms Townsend's 'novels', there is something steady and unwinking behind their
cute prose surfaces. Here, that is dissipated among all the actors' turns
and the continual one-joke vignettes. But the amiability-factor is pretty
high; and if you can top it up with your own monarchical kink, you should
enjoy the show.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Management: Degree of reluctance - George Bickerstaffe
wonders why there are so few women taking MBA courses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BICKERSTAFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women may be taking over top jobs - but the chances are that many do not
have an MBA. Business schools, perhaps surprisingly, remain a bastion of
maleness.
The UK-based Association of MBAs (AMBA), drawing on its own surveys and
other data, says that the number of women taking MBA programmes in the UK
has struggled to stay around 20 per cent of the total since 1989. Before
that it was lower.
In the US, in 1991-92, the latest period for which official Department of
Education statistics are available, around 35 per cent of masters degrees in
management were conferred on women. Anecdotal evidence suggests, however,
that female enrolment has since fallen significantly, with some schools said
to have dropped from 40 per cent to around 20 per cent.
In some top European schools the imbalance may be getting better, but women
are still in a clear minority. At Insead outside Paris admissions of women
have just risen to 24 per cent, against 17 per cent in the early 1990s.
At London Business School 27 per cent of full-time and 25 per cent of
part-time MBA students are women, figures which are up on recent years. Only
8 per cent of students taking LBS's new MSc in finance, however, are female.
Even at the Open Business School, part of the Open University, less than a
quarter of all MBA students are female, although the flexible nature of
learning at home might seem better suited to some women.
Business schools would love to have more women on their programmes - but
they are baffled as to why women apparently show such little interest in the
degree.
'You would have thought it would have been an ideal way to break the glass
ceiling,' says Leo Murray, director of Cranfield School of Management in the
UK (25 per cent women on its full-time and part-time MBAs).
Jason Sedine, associate director of international programmes at ISA, the MBA
arm of the prestigious grande e'cole HEC in Paris (again 25 per cent women),
believes the corporate sector needs to give a lead.
'In certain fields, such as pharmaceutical marketing, for example, women are
moving to really high levels, but not yet the very top,' he says. 'Business
needs to provide more opportunities and role models for women.'
The view that it is continuing discrimination in the workplace that prevents
women studying an MBA is widespread.
'They can hit chauvinism in their jobs,' says Helen Henderson, admissions
director at Insead. 'People ask them what are they are going to do with
their husbands and children when they have to travel internationally.'
Sheila Cameron, former MBA programme director at the Open Business School,
is not sure that is the whole reason. 'Distance learning requires a heavy
financial and time commitment,' she says. 'Women find it very hard to juggle
a job, family and study.'
She also comments that in general women tend to be more diffident about
their abilities than men and seem less willing to invest in their own
development. More pragmatically, she points out that the OBS MBA is targeted
at experienced managers and there are fewer women than men in that group.
Murray also raises the vexed question of age.
'The growing insistence on work experience by MBA programmes tends to work
against women,' he says. 'It puts them in their mid to late 20s, which is a
key time for marrying and having a family.'
Although the numbers on programmes are relatively low, significantly more
women who apply are accepted than men. The business schools are adamant that
this does not represent positive discrimination. Women simply are better
candidates, says Don Martin, director of admissions at the University of
Chicago's Graduate School of Business. 'There is no question that once on a
programme, women perform exactly the same as men. They do every bit as
well.'
In order to encourage more female recruits Insead has offered sponsored
scholarships to women through the pages of Cosmopolitan magazine. Cranfield
has had its marketing literature picked over by women MBA students to remove
anything that might turn off women. Chicago has revamped its merit-based
scholarships to make sure women and minorities are given every opportunity.
It has also carried out some nifty marketing. The university's large and
leafy campus is on the south side of Chicago, not an area with the best
reputation. The school has run a campaign to counteract worries about its
location, including paying for women applicants to fly in and get to know
the area.
One approach that none of these has tried is simply to admit only women. But
there is a unique business school in Boston that has been doing just that
for the past 20 years. Simmons College Graduate School of Management is
thought to be the only all-women MBA programme in the world.
It was set up in 1974 by Anne Jardim and Margaret Henig, two women doctoral
students at nearby Harvard Business School, outraged by the treatment of
women students and by their career prospects.
Simmons runs a traditional rigorous MBA programme with added behavioural
courses geared to women's experience of the workplace. It works on the
premise that men create hierarchical organisations that look to a leader,
whereas women are generally more equality-based and participative.
Jardim, who once commented memorably that 'the ceiling isn't glass; it's a
very dense layer of men', explains why she thinks women do not take MBAs.
'Traditional programmes do not take cognisance of the barriers women have to
face,' she says. 'Where that added-value is present, women will buy into
it.'
Not all business academics accept that this approach is really favourable to
women. Many believe that an all-women learning environment is not the ideal
preparation for the business world. But Jardim contends that Simmons
students are not 'cosseted' and offers to back her graduates against women
graduates from any top school.

FT  21 OCT 94 / People: River &amp; Mercantile poaches HSBC asset management duo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Legge, 36, and William Carey, 33, who have worked together at
Henderson Administration and HSBC Asset Management, have been head-hunted to
spearhead the River &amp; Mercantile investment trust group's entry into the
fast-growing unit trust business.
It is understood that Legge, right, and Williams have been tempted away from
HSBC by the promise of a substantial equity stake in River &amp; Mercantile
Asset Management, a new subsidiary which will oversee the unit trust
operation.
River &amp; Mercantile is the flagship of one of Britain's oldest investment
trusts, which has been looking around for a new role for some time.
Earlier this year Mercury Asset Management, one of the industry leaders,
considered taking it over to expand its own investment trust operation.
However, this came to nothing and in September John Beckwith, a wealthy
property developer, and Chris Munro, 45, a former head of corporate broking
at Robert Fleming, bought a 49.9 per cent stake in River &amp; Mercantile
Investment Management. They have an option to buy another 30 per cent in two
years time.
Up to now River &amp; Mercantile Investment Management, which manages around
Pounds 400m, has concentrated on managing the group's small stable of
investment trusts.
However, Chris Munro, who took over as chief executive last month, wants to
move into the unit trust market and expand the group's international
business, particularly in areas like the Far East.
Legge has been with James Capel Unit Trusts, recently renamed HSBC Asset
Management, for six years and has helped increase its assets under
management from Pounds 50m to Pounds 1bn. Roy Brooks, the overall chief
executive of HSBC's European investment management business will look after
the group's European unit trusts until a successor is found for Legge, who
was managing director of the European unit trust operation, and Carey, the
sales director.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some successions are smoother than others; the one soon happening at
Clerical Medical, the UK's seventh largest mutual life company, with Pounds
11.5bn funds under management, is in a class of its own.
For Roger Corley, who will retire in April 1995 as the company's managing
director, has been with Clerical Medical since he left university. And he is
handing over to another career-long Clerical Medical stalwart, Robert
Walther, right, who has also been with the company since leaving university,
in 1965. Walther will have the title group chief executive.
Walther, 51, is a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries and an associate of
the Institute of Investment Management &amp; Research. A former chairman of the
Association of British Insurers Investment committee (1990-92), he joined
Clerical Medical after graduating from Oxford university, where he studied
mathematics.
From 1967 he was responsible for managing the company's fixed interest
investments, appointed deputy investment manager in 1972 and full manager in
1976 and assistant general manager (investments) in June 1980. He joined the
board in April 1985. His current position with Clerical Medical is
investment director.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Management: Putting re-engineering in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A large European multinational company recently launched a root-and-branch
redesign of its two most important operating processes: the way its units in
a dozen countries develop new products together; and its 'order to delivery'
cycle. The latter covers the processing of customer orders through the
company's sales organisation to its many factories across Europe, and the
delivery of products back to the market. The primary goal of both projects
is for the company to become more responsive to customer demands, cutting
time and costs sharply.
Both projects are examples of real 'business process re-engineering': rather
than merely improving existing processes, they involve a fundamental
redesign. But the company has not attached a 're-engineering' label to
either of them.
This is not because it shares the now widespread fear that any
re-engineering exercise worthy of the name will provoke resistance among
many of the managers involved. Nor is it because of an associated problem:
that re-engineering has been so hyped and misunderstood over the past 18
months that it is getting a bad name among many top managements for failing
to deliver anything like the promised results.
Instead, the company is avoiding the term for a deeper reason: that it knows
the re-engineering of such processes is only one part of a jigsaw of tricky,
interlocking changes that must be made if it is to achieve its newly
formulated 'vision' of delighting customers, rather than just satisfying
them, and of becoming the best company in its industry, rather than just a
competent leading player.
It sees four sets of parallel changes as all-important to this
transformation: first, breaking down barriers between its different
disciplinary specialists and national units by a series of procedural and
structural steps, of which the re-engineering of cross-unit processes is
only one; second, developing an explicit set of values and behaviour
guidelines which are subscribed to (or 'shared') by everyone in the
organisation; third, redefining the role of management in order to foster
much more empowerment, responsibility and decisiveness at every level. All
this requires the creation of the fourth factor: an unprecedented degree of
openness and trust among managers.
The company's approach is in line with the conclusions of an independent
study of 100 European companies just delivered to the Brussels Commission*.
It reports that - so far, at least - most companies that introduce new ways
of working do not use re-engineering - at least by name. The study blames
this on the fact that re-engineering has become far too associated in
managers' minds with narrow targets such as headcount reductions and
cost-cutting.
On the face of it, the company's comprehensive approach would seem to differ
fundamentally from the 're-engineering' doctrine promulgated by consultants
such as Michael Hammer and James Champy, who together launched the fashion
early last year.
Writing on this page a fortnight ago (Oct 5), Hammer suggested that all
these other facets of change, though vital to a company, are subordinate to
the re-engineering of its business processes. On the same day, Champy was on
a public platform propounding a slightly different message, but one that
also sees re-engineering as the umbrella for all these other changes.
He argued that the re-engineering revolution would never be more than
half-successful until management itself was re-engineered; that is, until
the attitude of managers at every level of the organisation, and the nature
of their work, shifted from the traditional model of constant 'command and
control' to one of setting the broad direction, and then mobilising and
enabling others to manage themselves to a very considerable extent.
Through the defining of goals and the measurement of performance, this still
involves a strong degree of influence, but of a very different nature from
before.
Champy attributes the 'under-achievement' - or failure - of many
re-engineering projects to this managerial block. (Like Hammer, he disputes
the much-reported 'failure rate' of 70 per cent; he prefers to say that
30-40 per cent disappoint.)
In common with the myriad organisational specialists in consultancy and
academia who have spent many more years than he or Hammer trying to help
managers break through this block, he recognises how hard it is for
executives - especially senior ones - to make the leap, especially when they
fear for their own jobs.
Ideally, it should make no difference - except to rival consultancies -
whether the change jigsaw is given the umbrella term of 're-engineering', or
something more generic, such as 'organisational change' or 'transformation'.
What really matters is managerial recognition that all the different pieces
form a challenging and interlocking system that cannot be altered - except
chaotically - just by altering one of them.
But most managers try to do precisely that, since they are not used to
thinking in systems terms. Over the past few years they have grasped
desperately at one piece of the jigsaw after another in isolation, from
culture change to process re-engineering. By doing so they confound their
purpose, and compromise the readiness of their organisations to confront the
real complexities of change.
That is why easily misunderstood metaphors such as re-engineering are so
attractive yet so dangerous. It is not surprising that wary companies avoid
them like the plague.

Work between academics and industry in the UK has produced developments in
medical science, air traffic control and architecture, according to a joint
study, writes Sheila Jones.
In one project, X-rays and other medical images are combined to give
computerised 3-dimensional pictures. These should enable early detection of
blood clots in heart surgery and greater precision in brain surgery to avoid
nerve or vessel damage.
Computing tools are being developed to reduce bugs in software used in
conditions where safety is critical, such as air traffic control. The study
also points to work on enhanced virtual reality for use in architecture and
engineering.

Dwindling fish stocks could lead to a shortage of the fish oils that are in
great demand for nutritional supplements. So an alternative source is being
developed by an Anglo-French joint venture, Clive Cookson writes.
Scotia Pharmaceuticals of the UK and Heliosynthese of France are pooling
their expertise to produce commercial quantities of polyunsaturated fatty
acids, the active ingredients of fish oil, in bioreactors stocked with
microscopic algae. Plants could be built off the Scottish and French coasts.
Heliosynthese has already screened hundreds of strains of ocean algae to
discover ones that grow well and make the desired fatty acids. Scotia plans
to use the output first in nutritional supplements, for example to enrich
infant formulae, and then as the basis for a new range of pharmaceutical
products.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Technology: Equipped for the battle ahead - Barclays Bank is
using new software to help it make lending decisions / Financial services IT
innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Considering the importance that Barclays places on its new software for
guiding managers' lending decisions, the man in charge has a modest
description of what it means to customers. 'It's like a very sophisticated
cigarette packet,' says David Weymouth, the project director for Lending
Advisor.
Rather than company directors having to make hasty sums on scraps of paper
to work out their financing needs, they can be shown them on personal
computer screens. The Pounds 10m system is to be installed in 300 UK
branches by the end of this year for use in lending to companies with
turnover of at least Pounds 250,000.
Yet this is only one of Lending Advisor's purposes. Another is to ensure
that Barclays never again allows a mass of lending to weak and volatile
companies during periods of rapid economic growth. This was a factor behind
the bad debts that led to Barclays making a Pounds 242m loss two years ago.
The use of computers to guide decisions made until now by managers alone is
controversial. Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, was criticised
earlier this year for saying that customers were not willing to pay enough
to spend time with 'the old-fashioned bank manager of myth'.
Lending Advisor does not automate the credit decision in the way credit
scoring does for unsecured personal lending. Barclays is working on credit
scoring of lending for small business start-ups, but Weymouth says the
approach is inapproriate for more sophisticated companies.
The cash flows and creditworthiness of large companies are much harder to
monitor, requiring human interpretation. On the other hand, small businesses
that are financed by second mortgages on homes, and run through a single
account, can be monitored - and so credit-scored - relatively easily.
Furthermore, company directors do not want the bank manager sitting in front
of them merely to be a mouthpiece for a centralised or automated decision on
whether they will be lent money.
'Our customers tell us that they want to come and talk to a manager who has
authority,' says Weymouth.
Given these factors, Barclays could simply have chosen to carry on with the
traditional system of allowing managers who are trained in lending to carry
on making individual decisions within centrally laid-down guidelines. But
Weymouth argues that Lending Advisor offers a number of advantages:
It gives managers easy access to central guidelines. Rather than managers
having to 'scurry around' searching for files on lending policy for
companies in particular industries, such policies are automatically
displayed on the computer screen when the industrial classification is
entered.
It speeds up the decision-making process. If a local manager has to seek a
sanction for a loan from a regional or national office, the details can be
sent through electronically rather than by forwarding paper. Similarly,
future applications can be processed using information already stored.
For the first time, Barclays will have a central database of information on
up to 75,000 companies which can be analysed and used to formulate lending
policy. 'It is not just having the information, it is having it in a form
you can use that is not scattered around 300 offices,' says Weymouth.
The system runs from Barclays' Gloucester computing centre, using IBM
transaction processing software, and two databases. The software is based on
proprietory software developed by the software company Syntelligence in the
US. It was based on earlier software used to guide insurance underwriting.
Basic balance sheet, profit and loss and cashflow data for a company is
entered centrally, leaving the local manager to fill in other details at a
terminal. They include assessments of a company's management, its
competitive position in the local industry, and projections of likely
growth.
The system compares the company's performance with others of similar size in
the same industry, rating things such as its gearing and operating margins
on a series of seven-point scales. Managers can use it to show customers
their future financing requirements given various rates of growth.
At the heart of the system is a 'sanctions screen' which provides an overall
credit rating on a nine-point scale. Managers have the final decision on
whether to lend, but they know that there will be a stronger onus on them to
explain a decision to lend to a poorly-rated company.
Weymouth argues that this credit rating simply helps to add 'rigour and
discipline' to lending decisions. 'If a firm has a poor rating, a manager
should look carefully at the loan price, and the security. We want that in
an unautomated world, but we do not always achieve it,' he says.
In future, Barclays might be able to use Lending Advisor in a more
prescriptive way. By using the data it will collect to analyse the actual
risks of lending to companies that have different ratings, it could work out
what margins it should charge, telling managers through Lending Advisor.
This would fit with Barclays' long-term aim of being able to allocate
capital according to 'risk-adjusted' returns. Yet it would also raise
questions about how much true autonomy a manager would retain. Weymouth
emphasises that managers will retain freedom of manoeuvre, within limits.
He also argues that Lending Advisor could actually help to increase the
amount of autonomy a manager enjoys, if it gives the bank more reliable data
from branches. 'If you are more confident in information flows to the
centre, you may be more confident in the discretions you can give,' he says.
Yet Lending Advisor - for which 1,200 managers have been prepared with a
five-day training course - gives Barclays the potential for tighter control
as well as access to better data. Weymouth says the bank could hardly have
carried on relying on the old ways.
'It is like some early battles of the Boer War. People had not quite
realised that if you advanced in serried ranks with rifles raised, it was a
highly dangerous manoeuvre,' he says. Barclays hopes that in the lending
battles to come, its managers now have rather better equipment to wield.

Transax, the cheque guarantee company, has introduced an electronic system
to speed up cheque authorisation.
Use of the system at 150 retail outlets over a year showed authorisation
times comparable with credit card processing times, according to Transax,
which guarantees cheques for amounts over bank guaranteed limits.
Clearance takes less than 20 seconds through a direct link between a cash
register and the Transax computer if the retailer already has an integrated
electronic till. The link can also be made through some credit card
terminals, or via a Verifone unit, which connects to the till, telephone
line, and electricity source. Details are keyed into a keypad and the
response is made through the cash register.
An optional 'cheque reader' which feeds the cheque details into the Verifone
automatically costs Pounds 6.45 a month to rent. The Verifone, at Pounds
10.20 a month, takes 6 sq in of counter space. An alternative electronic
service, the ChequeTone, operates on an ordinary tone-dial telephone. Cheque
details and code numbers are keyed into the telephone and an electronic
voice gives the response, authorising or rejecting the cheque. Clearance
time is about 30 seconds.
The computer assesses customers on the basis of their cheque-writing
history. Transax also has access to a 'hot card' database of stolen cards,
compiled by several of the main clearing banks.
Last year, 3bn cheque payments were made in the UK, compared with 1.45bn
paid by cards, including debit, credit, charge and store cards.
Checkpoint Security Services has introduced Windows-compatible software for
companies transmitting funds through the UK Bankers Automated Clearing
Service. Winbacs costs Pounds 595 excluding VAT.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Bank loans boosted as credit growth remains subdued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank lending grew at a faster rate than expected in September, but the
overall growth of UK credit is still quite subdued.
Figures released by the Bank of England yesterday show that M4, the
government's measure of broad money supply, grew by a seasonally adjusted
0.4 per cent between August and September. Over the 12 months to September,
it has risen by 4.8 per cent, well towards the lower end of the government's
3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range.
Within the M4 total, sterling lending to the private sector - excluding
banks and building societies - rose by Pounds 3bn in September, the highest
monthly figure since December 1993.
The Bank of England figures appear to contradict statistics from the British
Bankers Association which show a rise in lending of only Pounds 183 in
September, down from Pounds 1.5bn in August. However, the association's
figures exclude building society lending and only cover the main British
banking groups. It appears that a wider spread between base rates and money
market rates in September caused borrowers to switch from major banks to
smaller banks in order to reduce their borrowing costs.
Even with the Pounds 3bn jump in September, the trend in growth of bank
lending remains very weak. Lending to the M4 private sector rose by 3.7 per
cent in the year to September.
Total M4 growth has been stronger than that for bank lending because of
'underfunding' by the government, which occurs when the Bank of England does
not sell enough gilts to cover the public sector borrowing requirement.
Association figures show that the corporate sector is continuing to repay
bank borrowing. There was a particularly high repayment of Pounds 719m by
the financial sector. The one exception was the manufacturing sector, which
borrowed a net Pounds 28m, having repaid Pounds 167m in August.
The personal sector continues to borrow, however, with lending for house
purchases rising by Pounds 659m and that for credit cards by Pounds 83m.
Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International Europe,
said that consumer credit growth was quite strong while corporations were
merely replacing bank debt with funding from sources such as bonds and
equities.
While broad money growth has been slow, narrow money growth (mainly notes
and coins) has been strong. The Bank of England yesterday revised up the
annual growth rate of M0 in September from 7.1 per cent to 7.2 per cent. The
government's monitoring range is 0 per cent to 4 per cent.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Lloyd's may change debt recovery rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, Insurance Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyd's of London yesterday provoked a fresh confrontation with lossmaking
Names by unveiling plans intended to ensure damages won in court by Names
for negligence are used to settle their outstanding debts at the insurance
market.
Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, said the rule change was a response to
pressure from members who had settled accounts and were annoyed at those who
had not.
But action groups representing Names said the move was likely to be
challenged in the courts. 'Many burnt Names have taken the most horrendous
risks in pursuing legal action,' said Mr Tom Benyon, director of the Society
of Names, which represents lossmaking members. 'Now many will feel it's
'tails they lose, heads Lloyd's wins'.' He said a one-month consultation
period on the plans announced by Lloyd's was 'a fig leaf'.
The change - subject to Department of Trade and Industry approval - would
affect the deeds of 'premium trusts' held by Names, whose assets have
traditionally supported the market. These funds are used for receiving
premiums on behalf of members and for paying out claims and profits.
To protect those taking out insurance polices at Lloyd's, the insurance
market has set up a 'central fund' which is used to pay claims when Names'
funds are not sufficient. Currently the corporation is pursuing members for
Pounds 1.2bn paid on their behalf.
A 1992 court case made clear compensation payments for negligence did not
have to be paid into the premium trusts. Lloyd's intention is that in future
they should - up to the level required to cover Names' outstanding
liabilities.
The rule change may well have been provoked by the question mark over
whether members of the Gooda Walker Action Group would use damages which it
won in the High Court earlier this month, to settle debts with Lloyd's.
But the right of Lloyd's to make payments on behalf of Names out of the
central fund is already being challenged in a separate court action.
Moreover, Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said
Names owed money to many sources, including banks, and the rule change
amounted to an attempt by Lloyd's to become a preferential creditor. He said
Lloyd's was trying to alter the terms of its contract with Names without
their consent.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Rate rise damps mortgage lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rise in interest rates last month appears to have hit mortgage lending -
with commitments to new loans made by building societies in September
slipping from the previous month.
However, the rise of 0.5 of a percentage point in interest rates also helped
societies - by boosting the inflow of customer savings.
Statistics released yesterday by the Building Societies Association show
that net new commitments last month dropped to Pounds 2.97bn, compared with
Pounds 3.02bn in August. In 1993, the September figure was Pounds 2.56bn -
increased from Pounds 2.43bn in August.
The monthly loans figures are an important forward-looking indicator as they
translate into lending carried out in following weeks.
New net lending in September totalled Pounds 1.11bn, against Pounds 1.13bn
in August and just Pounds 747m in September last year.
In spite of the slight month-on-month drop in both gross and net new loans
Mr Adrian Coles, the association's director-general, sounded upbeat. He said
levels of lending were now close to those in 1992 and significantly higher
than in the same period last year.
But he warned that the 'cautious, yet relatively stable market' could be
damaged by further rises in interest rates.
He said the growth in lending probably meant societies were recovering
market-share, rather than that the market was improving. Last summer the
popularity of fixed-rate mortgages offered by banks severely hit societies'
lending.
The higher rates societies were able to offer on deposits after the rise in
base rates helped them to attract more savings. Net retail receipts totalled
Pounds 322m - the highest monthly level since May and more than three times
the August figure of Pounds 91m.
Seasonal factors were also an element - savings usually increase at this
time of year.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Consortium wants entire Rosyth site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three companies and a Scottish bank have formed a consortium which would
seek to take over the entire Ministry of Defence site at Rosyth on the Firth
of Forth. It would develop parts of it for commercial use, allowing the navy
to continue to use the areas it needed for defence purposes.
The Ministry of Defence is currently seeking bids for the privately-operated
Rosyth Royal Naval Dockyard as well as its counterpart at Devonport. But the
Rosyth 2000 consortium, which was launched yesterday, proposes buying the
entire 1,200-acre MoD site at Rosyth, which also includes the Rosyth naval
base, housing and other facilities, a tank farm, and farmland.
The consortium consists of Babcock International, which operates the naval
dockyard; Forth Ports, the quoted company which runs all the ports on the
Forth estuary; ScottishPower, the electricity company; and Bank of Scotland.
Babcock International will be lodging a separate indicative bid for the
dockyard by the end of this month with a view to acquiring it by 1996. But
like the other consortium members it believes there should be a
comprehensive approach to developing the entire site.
Rosyth 2000 envisages leasing back to the navy the Rosyth naval base, which
is being scaled down to a support facility in two years' time with the loss
of 700 civilian jobs. Under its scheme the dockyard would continue to be
commercially managed by Babcock International.
Forth Ports would establish a commercial port along the unused waterfront
and use it for shipping bulk cargoes. It could also establish a roll-on
roll-off freight and passenger terminal.
'The new port would be a long-term development to complement our existing
major ports of Leith and Grangemouth,' said Mr Hugh Thompson, Forth Ports'
chief executive. 'It would have the advantage of excellent access to the
motorway system and a lot of land behind it for ancillary developments.'
Other vacant or under-utilised land would be developed as an industrial
estate or business park, in conjunction with Fife Enterprise, the local
enterprise company, and the local authorities. Redundant naval housing and
leisure facilities could be developed for civilian use.
'It's important to take an overall, helicopter-like view of the development
of this site, rather than see it developed piecemeal,' Mr Thompson said.
ScottishPower would develop and operate the utilities on the site for the
use of occupants.
Bank of Scotland, whose general manager Mr Gavin Masterton is acting
chairman of Rosyth 2000, would provide financial backing for the new
venture.
Rosyth 2000 has held preliminary discussions with the MoD and the Scottish
Office over the past six months. So far the MoD has not given its view but
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary and an Edinburgh MP, is known to
be interested in it.
The consortium refused yesterday to indicate how much it would have to bid
for the site. It pointed out that along with the assets it would also be
taking on substantial liabilities. Although the nuclear risks should be
contained within the dockyard there was likely to be contamination from the
tank farm, which dates back to the first world war, and considerable other
industrial pollution.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Higher exports boost September car production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car production rose 7.8 per cent in September to 125,138, the highest level
for the month for 21 years, as output was boosted by higher exports, Kevin
Done writes.
Production for export rose by 17.9 per cent year-on-year to 55,136, while
output for the domestic market rose only 1.1 per cent to 70,002.
Car production in the first nine months of the year rose 3 per cent to
1,075,001, but the growth has accelerated in the past four months. Export
production in the first nine months rose 6.1 per cent to 418,134.
Export growth has come from Rover as well as from Honda and Toyota, which
are both developing new car plants in the UK with about three-quarters of
production earmarked for export.
Production of commercial vehicles in September rose 15 per cent year-on-year
to 20,763.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Rover takes export route to expansion: The 1,450 new jobs
announced this week reflect a rising market share abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover, the leading UK carmaker, remains uncomfortably dependent on its
domestic market, but its exports are rising sharply thanks to an increasing
investment in its foreign sales and distribution networks.
The announcement earlier this week that it was creating 1,450 new jobs at
its UK plants stemmed directly from the steady inroads Rover has been making
into foreign car markets, even though its market shares remain
unsatisfactory, particularly in Germany. However, its acquisition earlier
this year by BMW, the German carmaker, should help overcome the scepticism
of the country's car buyers.
At the beginning of 1992 the company began a far-reaching restructuring of
its sales and marketing operations with the creation of Rover Europe aimed
at ending the unhealthy dominance of the business by the UK market.
'Despite what we said Rover was still a UK-dominated company,' said Mr
Graham Morris, managing director of Rover Europe. 'The Europeans were always
left behind.'
Rover - languishing at the time with a share of about 2.5 per cent of the
west European market and suffering heavy losses - set itself an initial
target of winning a 3 per cent share.
In the first nine months of the strategy sales in the whole of west Europe
rose 9 per cent to 306,000 to give it a 3.3 per cent market share. It is
still to achieve satisfactory earnings, although operating profits are
rising strongly after two years of operating losses in 1991 and 1992.
Last year operating profits totalled Pounds 56m on a turnover of Pounds
4.3bn. 'We should be making Pounds 250m to Pounds 300m a year with a 5 per
cent to 6 per cent return on turnover,' said Mr Morris. 'We must enrich our
sales mix and raise margins through the way we sell our cars.'
Rover's retail sales in the first nine months worldwide rose 9 per cent to
371,805 from 341,075 a year earlier, with sales in continental Europe
increasing 20 per cent, in Japan by 26.6 per cent and in North America by
127 per cent, where they were helped by the launch of the Land Rover
Discovery range in the US.
In the UK sales increased by only 3.2 per cent - but Mr John Towers, Rover
chief executive, is willing to accept a fall in UK market share, as long as
this is more than offset by rising exports.
Rover's share in the UK fell to 12.4 per cent in the first nine months from
13.2 per cent a year ago. Mr Morris said: 'To establish Rover as a more
up-market company in the UK we had to face the reality that that would mean
a lower market share.' It is restructuring its UK sales network with a
reduction in the number of dealers from 650 at present to 500 by the end of
1996.
The continental European dealer network is also undergoing tough surgery.
The number - about 1,500 - is unlikely to change significantly, but the
make-up of the network is being transformed. 'In France in the last two
years we have replaced 40 per cent of our dealerships either with new
dealers or with new premises,' said Mr Morris.
Rover has established a franchise plan for the whole of Europe covering
network size, dealer locations and standards. 'It is the quality of dealers
that will change and not the quantity,' said Mr Morris.
It is making strong progress in France, Italy and Spain with rising sales
and growing market share, but it is in Germany that it faces its stiffest
task.
'We will only sell about 13,000 this year in Germany,' said Mr Morris. 'That
is an increase of around 20 per cent, but the market share is only 0.4 per
cent and that is unacceptable. Our network in Germany is our weakest in the
whole of Europe.'
It has set an initial target of 2 per cent for its German market share and
is now spending heavily on advertising and promotion.
Many small importers struggle in the German market against the entrenched
domestic producers, but BMW is now actively encouraging its strongest
domestic dealers to take on the Rover and Land Rover franchises.
Rising sales in continental Europe as well as in important overseas markets
such as the US and Japan should take Rover vehicle production well above
500,000 next year. The new jobs announced this week should not be the last.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Views sought on planned Gas split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Key aspects of the planned split of British Gas into trading and
transportation arms are reviewed in a consultation document by Ofgas, the
industry regulator, published yesterday, David Lascelles writes.
Ofgas is seeking comments on terms which would oblige TransCo, the
transportation and storage arm, to offer the same terms to British Gas and
independent gas suppliers.
The regulator said: 'Short of divestment, full and effective separation
represents the best protection against British Gas' trading businesses
benefiting from being part of the same company as Transco.'
Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive, said it was a 'tough but
realistic package' but added: 'We recognise the need for effective
separation at home but this must not hinder our ability to compete
successfully in overseas markets.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / Radical plan for small-business accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small companies could be freed from statutory accounting codes if a radical
report from the accountancy profession's working party on standards is
accepted.
The working party, set up under the auspices of the profession's six
professional bodies and commissioned by the Accounting Standards Board, has
suggested exemptions for the vast majority of companies.
The report, expected to be published by the end of the month, will go out
for wide public review before a final set of conclusions is presented to the
board - the body which sets financial reporting standards.
While thousands of small companies will welcome the cut in what they see as
red tape, the response from other interested parties, such as bankers and
the Inland Revenue, may not be as supportive.
Mr Ken Wild, chairman of the working party on generally accepted accounting
principles, confirmed yesterday that the final report will seek radical
exemptions - but insisted it was a 'starting position'.
The report will urge the board to exempt companies with an annual turnover
of less than Pounds 2.8m from all but four of the existing statements of
standard accounting practice. These would be SSAPs 4, 9, 13 and 17. The
exemptions cover accounting for government grants, stores and work in
progress, research and development, and post-balance sheet events.
Small companies would also be freed, under the proposals, from all the
board's seven published financial reporting standards and all but one of the
abstracts produced by the task force on urgent issues. The one exception
covers the ability to 'override' certain accounting rules in order to
present a true and fair view.
Significantly, the group is also seeking to exempt small companies from all
future board standards unless a special case can be made for their
inclusion.
While the board will welcome the results of the public consultation it is
likely to have reservations about sweeping away too many controls on company
accounts - particularly in areas such as pensions.
Mr Wild said: 'We believe that the ASB will probably accept the report
provided it has got public support.'
Mr Wild, who is technical partner at Touche Ross, said in some cases
following the rules in a small company actually led to misleading accounts.
Receiverships for the three months from July to September rose by 5.8 per
cent on the previous three months, according to figures from accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick.
In the third quarter 508 corporate failures were recorded, compared with 480
in the second quarter. In spite of the increase the total number of
receiverships for the first nine months of 1994 is down on the same period
in 1993 - 1,579 compared to 2,332.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Cost of phone calls to US to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Large cuts in the price of transatlantic phone calls are likely after the
government yesterday confirmed it would allow a new form of
telecommunications competition between the US and UK.
International simple resale (ISR) allows telecoms companies to resell to
their customers capacity leased from the main transatlantic carriers at a
discount to present tariffs. They can then connect the calls into the public
networks in both countries.
With leased-line prices only a fraction of existing transatlantic tariffs,
new telecoms operators are expected to offer cut-price services.
This is likely to force the main telecoms operators - including AT&amp;T of the
US and British Telecommunications and Mercury of the UK - to cut
transatlantic prices to fight off competition.
The government has licensed 19 companies to offer ISR services, and other
applications are likely.
Business users, who account for most transatlantic telecoms traffic, are
likely to be the main winners - particularly small and medium-sized
businesses that have gained less than large companies from competition in
the telecoms market.
Announcing the decision, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
said ISR underlined the UK's status as one of the world's most open telecoms
markets.
It is also likely to increase the pressure on mainland European governments
to open up their telecoms markets, most of which remain monopolies. At
present, voice telephony will not be subject to competition in most of the
European Union until 1998.
International simple resale is already permitted between the UK and
Australia, Canada and Sweden. Other ISR agreements are likely to follow as
liberalisation spreads internationally.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Pension schemes urged to help former members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Occupational pension schemes are being encouraged to re-admit people who
followed poor advice to opt out of a scheme and take a personal pension, in
a move which would help some victims of pension mis-selling.
The call from the National Association of Pension Funds comes less than a
week before a report from the Securities and Investments Board, the City's
chief regulator, on how to compensate those who have lost out from taking
poor advice.
These guidelines, expected to be published on Tuesday, will set out what
redress should be offered by life insurance companies and independent
advisers that mis-sold personal pensions to people opting out of an
employer's scheme or transferring a lump sum from a former employer's
scheme.
While the NAPF statement - which underlines a message in a letter to members
in June - should help those who wrongly opted out of a scheme, it is
unlikely to assist those who followed bad advice to buy a pension transfer
with a lump sum. Most occupational schemes are expected not to reinstate
former members in these circumstances.
The NAPF is also trying to ease the vast administrative task of trying to
compensate for mis-selling, which life companies are routinely describing as
a 'nightmare'. One element of reviewing cases is that life companies will
have to ask occupational schemes for further information about the benefits
they provide.
A standard set of fees for occupational schemes to charge life companies, on
a non-profit basis, is likely to be agreed shortly between the NAPF and the
Association of British Insurers.
The two organisations are also near final agreement on standardised forms
for providing information, in an effort to make the process run more
smoothly.
'Cases to be reviewed will cover individuals who have suffered loss as a
result of being mis-sold a personal pension,' Mr Ron Amy, NAPF chairman,
said yesterday. 'We have asked our members to respond to any enquiries which
will help to remedy these situations.'
His statement comes against a background of increasing complaints from life
companies about the role of occupational schemes in the sale of pension
transfers.
Some life companies have been emphasising the duties of schemes' trustees
and consulting actuaries to provide proper information that helps people
decide whether to transfer out of an occupational scheme.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Crackdown on data crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tougher penalties for selling confidential financial information obtained by
deception - such as details of a company's bank account - were approved by
the Commons last night.
Conviction on indictment could result in a maximum term of five years'
imprisonment and a fine under a Lords amendment to the criminal justice and
public order bill which was approved by MPs.
However, a Lords' amendment to make selling confidential financial
information a criminal offence was rejected.
Mr David Maclean, Home Office minister, said the proposed amendment went
beyond recommendations to counter unjustified invasion of privacy made by
the committee headed by Sir David Calcutt.
However, he suggested that it might be necessary to return to the rejected
amendment if some of the Calcutt proposals were not introduced.
The government secured a majority of 33 to reject a Labour attempt to make
it an offence to provide information obtained by deceit even if it was not
sold.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour spokesman on city affairs, referred to
advertisements offering to find out a person's bank balance for Pounds 250.
Mr Darling complained that the provisions introduced by the government would
not prevent information being obtained in written form so that no
infringement of the Data Protection Act would be involved.

Gatwick Express, the train operating company which runs Gatwick station, is
to tone down its advertising and give greater prominence to the activities
of competing services following an investigation by the rail regulator,
Charles Batchelor writes.
Mr John Swift QC, the regulator, said yesterday that he accepted that
Gatwick Express was taking 'the appropriate management action' to ensure its
staff acted impartially. He will continue to monitor the situation.
The investigation was requested by the franchising director, responsible for
selling rail franchises to the private sector, to establish rules of good
practice before companies moved into the private sector.

FT  21 OCT 94 / MPs slam costs of defence orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Taxpayers have forfeited millions of pounds and important weapon systems
have been unnecessarily delayed because of poor management and 'incredible'
errors, according to a Commons defence committee report.
In a detailed study of four kinds of military equipment, the MPs call for
the civil servants responsible for such mistakes to be 'reprimanded or
otherwise penalised'.
The committee found that the cost of developing an earth station to receive
signals from military satellites had ballooned by 62 per cent to Pounds 99m
because the project had not been properly defined in advance.
The price of a new system to scatter mines from a vehicle had also risen
'significantly' from Pounds 37m. The Ministry of Defence was 'in some
confusion' over how to explain this, according to the report.
The committee sharply criticises the ministry's rejection of an offer by
International Business Machines of a flexible, inflation-linked price in a
contract for 44 Merlin helicopters. The ministry's failure to examine IBM's
offer fully was described as 'grossly negligent' behaviour which might have
cost up to Pounds 95m.
However the committee acknowledges that new procedures, introduced at the
ministry over the past year, should avoid such mistakes in future.
Analysing the multinational project to make Trigat anti-tank missiles, the
committee notes that Britain found itself helping to develop a weapon which
it might not need.
But after negotiations on price the ministry concluded it would be cheaper
to stay in.
'The Ministry of Defence has found itself in the highly unusual position of
continuing to participate in the development programme for a missile for
which it has no specific programme,' the report notes.

FT  21 OCT 94 / PM set for key move on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, DAVID OWEN and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major will today map out his government's response to the IRA and
loyalist ceasefires in Northern Ireland in what Whitehall officials last
night were describing as a landmark on the road to permanent peace in the
province.
During a visit to the province later today Mr Major is expected to publicly
acknowledge for the first time that the government is now operating on the
'working assumption' that the end to violence is permanent.
He is likely also to spell out the terms and timetable for talks with Sinn
Fein, the IRA's political wing, to bring the republican movement into the
negotiations for a new constitutional settlement.
Speaking ahead of a planned summit meeting on Monday with Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, Mr Major will signal the end of the
exclusion orders banning Mr Gerry Adams and other prominent Sinn Fein
members from visiting the British mainland.
Senior Unionist politicians predicted that Mr Major would also signpost the
essential elements of the govern-ment's tests for the IRA to demonstrate its
good faith.
In the meantime, he is likely to seek to underline his own determination to
secure peace by announcing a phased withdrawal to barracks of British troops
in the province.
The prime minister's visit comes after a meeting of senior ministers
yesterday which gave him a free hand to press on towards talks with
republican leaders by Christmas.
Downing Street said the government was moving towards adopting a 'working
assumption' that the IRA ceasefire was permanent.
The summit between Mr Reynolds and Mr Major will be their first face-to-face
meeting since the IRA and loyalist ceasefires. The two will discuss the
joint framework document with which they hope to inject momentum into
political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties.
In Dublin yesterday, Mr Reynolds met Mr Adams to discuss progress on the
peace process and plans for a cross-party national forum for peace and
reconciliation.
Mr Adams said: 'The momentum for real peace is still there, and is
building.' But he criticised the 'hesitant, faltering and begrudging' UK
response to the IRA ceasefire.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Exports boost car output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Car production rose 7.8 per cent in September to 125,138, the highest level
for the month for 21 years, as output was boosted by higher exports.
Production for export rose by 17.9 per cent year-on-year to 55,136, while
output for the domestic market rose only 1.1 per cent to 70,002.
Car production in the first nine months of the year has risen 3 per cent to
1,075,001, but the rate of increase has accelerated during the past four
months in spite of the marked slow-down in the growth of new car sales in
the domestic market.
Export production in the first nine months has risen 6.1 per cent to
418,134, while output for the home market rose 1.1 per cent to 656,867.
Export growth has come from Rover as well as from Honda and Toyota, which
are both developing new car plants in the UK with about three-quarters of
production earmarked for export.
Rover announced earlier this week that it was planning to create 1,450 new
jobs at its UK plants during the next six months in order to raise output to
meet increasing sales, in particular in export markets.
Production of commercial vehicles in September rose 15 per cent year-on-year
to 20,763. Commercial vehicle output has risen 16.6 per cent to 165,150 in
the first nine months, halting the almost continuous decline since the end
of the 1960s.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Westminster 'planned illicit housing policies'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster Conservative councillors planned an 'illicit' use of housing
policies to gentrify marginal wards to win a closely fought election, it was
claimed on the second day of public hearings into gerrymandering
allegations.
Mr Andrew Arden, acting for the objectors who made the original
gerrymandering allegations, highlighted a series of confidential documents
written by leading councillors on how to win the 1990 local elections.
Mr Arden described how the strategy documents 'succinctly' set out an
'illicit' policy to sell council homes in eight marginal wards, based on the
assumption that the buyers were more likely to vote Tory.
One document circulated in September 1986 by the then leader of the council,
Dame Shirley Porter, said: 'What is gentrification? In short, it is ensuring
that the right people live in the right areas. The areas are relatively easy
to define: target wards identified on the basis of electoral trends and
results.'
The same document said Tory councillors were commissioning a report from an
outside group - PA Cambridge Economic Consultants - which would help 'to
define which initiatives are most likely to produce the desired results'. Mr
Arden said one of the consultants was briefed by Dame Shirley. Notes of this
meeting recorded that the Conservatives' strategy was to 'push Labour voters
out of marginal wards' and 'boot out certain categories' of residents.
But the consultants' report highlighted the need to maintain the number of
homes available for renting. Mr Arden said the Tory councillors found the
report 'disappointing'.
One confidential document from January 1987 advocated that 'the short-term
objective must be to target the marginal wards, and as a matter of utmost
urgency, redress the imbalance by encouraging a pattern of tenure which is
more likely to translate into Conservative votes'.
In his report in January the district auditor, Mr John Magill, found
provisionally that Dame Shirley and nine others had wasted Pounds 21m on
selling off the homes. These accusations are denied. The hearings continue
today.

Only 16 local people were offered jobs in the City of London during the

with high unemployment.
The target figure for job offers had been 200. 'We were over-ambitious,'
said Ms Sharon Collins, the company's managing director, yesterday.
A total of 122 job vacancies were advertised through the brokerage by 49
City employers. As many as 620 candidates submitted applications, of whom
115 were interviewed and 16 were offered jobs. But Ms Collins said the
placement level had improved substantially over the past six months, with 18
offered jobs out of 250 applicants for 70 posts.
'Local people have not been used to the City's corporate culture,' Ms
Collins said. 'Companies are not going to change their attitudes overnight
either.'
The Brokerage is a partnership between City companies Kleinwort Benson, SG
Warburg, KPMG Peat Marwick, the Bank of England and the Corporation of
London in alliance with local authorities in Hackney and Islington and the
local training and enterprise council.
Companies participating in the scheme include Abbey National, KPMG, Midland
Bank, Baring Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Royal Insurance.
Ms Collins said yesterday that the company had become 'more pro-active' in
helping candidates to prepare their job applications and interview
techniques.
It is also establishing a computerised database of vacancies.
Mr Mike Ireland, the Bank of England's community relations director, has
replaced Mr Gareth Hughes as the company's chairman.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Business blow for 'dapper' lobbyist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At least one of the clients of Ian Greer Associates yesterday said it was
considering severing its links with the lobbyists at the centre of the
cash-for-questions allegations.
IGA, which denies allegations that it was the channel for payments to MPs in
return for parliamentary questions, is one of the longest-established and
most influential of the lobbying groups. It numbers among its clients
British Airways, British Gas, Cadbury Schweppes and Kingfisher.
One corporation said yesterday: 'A lot of Ian Greer's major clients will be
embarrased by this. It could be very damaging to his business. You're
innocent until you're proved guilty, but I'm sure a lot of people are
thinking very carefully.'
Yesterday's comments were the first indication that IGA may have to fight to
maintain its position.
Mr Greer, a former Tory party agent, has established a formidable track
record since he founded his company in 1982. Known for his attention to
detail and his understanding of the way Whitehall works, his list of
contacts is thought to be unrivalled.
One client said: 'He's got a considerable amount of political clout. He has
had a very good reputation for helping people to get their point across.
He's a dapper little chap - rather serious.'
Mr Steve Bevan, reporter with PR Week, described Mr Greer as 'charming,
autocratic and inspiring fierce loyalty' among his
Mr Bevan said that Mr Greer' strong links with the Tory party could pose a
problem in the future. 'Not only did he lend John Major a car during the
election, he is even rumoured to have driven it himself,' he said.
'But as companies wake up to the fact that there's a strong possibility of a
Labour government, they may consider moving to lobbyists considered to have
better Labour party links.'
According to one senior public relations executive with a close knowledge of
lobbying, Mr Greer specialised in cultivating an 'old-boy network'.
IGA is one of five groups which recently founded a trade association and
launched a code of conduct banning all financial links with MPs.
Mr Andrew Gifford, group chairman, said at the time: 'With attention on MPs
and their outside interests growing, a great deal of confusion has arisen
over the relationship between lobbyists and MPs. By establishing a register
of lobbyists . . . we hope to separate two distinct issues - the activities
of professional lobbyists on the one hand and the outside interests of MPs
on the other.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Parade of ministers passes through
doorway marked exit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Smith is the 11th member of the government to leave office for
non-political reasons since Mr John Major succeeded Baroness (then Mrs)
Thatcher as prime minister in 1990.
Almost all have quit following allegations about their private lives or
claims that they had benefited financially from unethical behaviour.
Most have denied any wrongdoing, but decided to return to the backbenches to
limit the political damage to the government.
Most of the resignations have occurred since last year's Tory party
conference in Blackpool when Mr Major launched his much-derided
Back-to-Basics initiative.
The campaign has been a big casualty of the spate of disclosures and
resignation.
The other is Mr Major, whose efforts to draw a line under government
failures have been undermined by a parade of embarrassed ministers:
Mr David Mellor, heritage secretary, quit in September 1992 after an
onslaught by the tabloid papers over allegations of an affair with an
actress.
Mr Mellor, who denied any impropriety, resigned after it emerged that he had
accepted a paid holiday from the daughter of a member of the Palestine
Liberation Organisation.
Mr Michael Mates, Northern Ireland minister, quit in June 1993 after
revelations about his relationship with the fugitive businessman Mr Asil
Nadir. Mr Mates, who denied any wrongdoing, was seriously damaged by the
disclosure that he sent Mr Nadir a watch inscribed 'don't let the buggers

Mr Tim Yeo, countryside minister, quit in January after disclosures about an
extra-marital affair. Mr Yeo said his private life had not affected his
ability to do his job. Lord Caithness resigned as a transport minister in
January after the suicide of his wife. His resignation was followed by
newspaper speculation about his private life.
Mr Alan Duncan resigned as a parliamentary private secretary in January
after it emerged that he had lent money to a neighbour to buy a house from
Westminster City Council at a discount, and that Mr Duncan had then bought
the house from him. He denies any wrongdoing.
Mr David Ashby resigned as a PPS in January after admitting sharing a bed
with a man during a holiday in France. Mr Ashby denies any impropriety.
Mr Hartley Booth, Finchley MP, resigned as a PPS after newspaper disclosures
of his friendship with a female Commons researcher. Mr Booth denied having
an affair.
Mr Michael Brown resigned as a whip in May after allegations in a Sunday
newspaper that he had had a homosexual relationship with a student. Mr Brown
denied any impropriety.
Mr David Tredinnick and Mr Graham Riddick were suspended as PPSs in July
pending an inquiry into newspaper allegations that they were prepared to
accept Pounds 1,000 each to table parliamentary questions.
Mr Tim Devlin, a junior whip, was involved in a row with the government's
business managers in July when he announced he had resigned over defence
cuts, only for the whips to announce that he had been sacked.
Lord Archer, former deputy party chairman, failed to achieve promotion
earlier this year after disclosures about his share-dealing activities. He
denies any impropriety.

Mr Neil Hamilton is not a man to duck a fight. Refusing to resign yesterday,
he told the government's business managers that he would fight to the finish
to prove he had done nothing wrong.
Mr Hamilton opened his campaign by issuing a writ for libel against The
Guardian, which printed disclosures about his alleged relationship with Mr
Mohamed Fayed before they were raised in the Commons.
'He says it is all lies and he will take The Guardian for millions,' a
friend said.
This is not the first time that Mr Hamilton has had recourse to the libel
courts. He issued a writ against the BBC in 1984 after a Panorama report
linked him to rightwing extremists in a programme called Maggie's Militant
Tendency.
Three years later the BBC admitted that the allegations were false, and paid
Pounds 20,000 damages plus costs.
Mr Hamilton celebrated by launching a ferocious attack on another BBC
programme about the government's defence policies.
A man of strong views, Mr Hamilton has been a supporter of the Conservative
right since 1970, when he sympathised with Mr Enoch Powell during a clash
over immigration that led to Mr Powell's dismissal from the shadow cabinet.
He is a believer in the deterrent value of the death penalty, and has called
for the reintroduction of corporal punishment for violent offenders.
Mr Hamilton took a strong stance on South Africa, defending Baroness
Thatcher as prime minister when she refused to toughen sanctions.
He once claimed that National Health Service operations were being
cancelled, not because of a staff shortage but because public-sector unions
had their 'snouts' in the public money trough.
But Mr Hamilton is more than an identikit rightwinger. An amusing speaker,
he was named parliamentary wit of the year in 1989 by the Spectator news
magazine.
The grandson of Welsh miners, Mr Hamilton was sufficiently Euro-sceptic to
defy Baroness Thatcher in 1986 by rebelling against legislation implementing
the Single European Act.
By the time of last year's debates on the Maastricht treaty he was in the
government and had to help Mr John Major force the bill through the Commons.
Mr Hamilton, 45, was born and educated in Wales, but has been MP for Tatton,
Cheshire, since June 1983. He made his mark by barracking Mr Neil Kinnock,
the former Labour leader, from the government back benches.
Spotted by Lady Thatcher, he was made a parliamentary private secretary in
1986 and a junior whip in 1990. Mr Major made him corporate affairs minister
at the trade and industry department in 1992.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Fayed sets out 'sham of men in high
office'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Mohamed Fayed, the owner of Harrods, last night defended his decision to
leak information about two ministers taking his money to ask questions in
the Commons.
However he said he was backing off from making any further revelations about
the case because of the threat of being involved in legal action.
Mr Michael Cole, Mr Fayed's spokesman, said: 'Mr Fayed considers he has done
his public duty by exposing the sham of men in high office and the
rottenness of an establishment that was prepared to have him vilified.'
He added: 'We are not considering naming any more names or providing any
more documentation. The legal situation makes it very difficult. We have to
keep clean.'
Mr Fayed spoke to several newspaper editors in recent weeks and told them
about the allegations regarding the two ministers before The Guardian
published them.
According to Mr Cole, concern that Mr Fayed was about to go public led to Mr
Ian Greer, the lobbyist linked to the MPs, calling for and obtaining a
meeting with the Harrods chairman on September 22.
During the meeting Mr Fayed confirmed his allegations while reiterating his
grievance against what he claimed was a violation of his rights at the hands
of the government. He expressed his continuing anger with the Department of
Trade and Industry's report into the Fayed brothers' takeover of House of
Fraser in 1985.
The report said that Mr Fayed and his two brothers had misrepresented their
origins, wealth, business interests and resources and had submitted false
evidence. The Fayeds have always disputed these conclusions, although an
appeal against it was rejected by the European Court of Human Rights the day
before the meeting with Mr Greer.
Mr Fayed also referred in his meeting with Mr Greer to his anger that his
younger brother Ali had had his application for British citizenship
'blocked' by ministers.
However Mr Cole last night denied that Mr Fayed had asked Mr Greer or any
other intermediary to convey the substance of the meeting to the prime
minister as a way of putting pressure on the government.
Although rejecting any implication of blackmail against the government, Mr
Major yesterday confirmed he had been informed about the allegations three
weeks ago by an unnamed third party.
Mr Major said that he had made it clear he was 'not prepared to come to any
arrangement with Mr Fayed'.
Last night however Mr Cole insisted that Mr Fayed's continuing wish was that
the government should 'discredit' the DTI report.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Tax guru known for his dry wit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Smith, who resigned yesterday as a junior Northern Ireland minister,
enjoys a reputation at Westminster for excellent connections with the worlds
of business and finance.
However, his parliamentary career has been marred by claims from Labour MPs
that he has asked parliamentary questions on behalf of companies for which
he has acted as a paid consultant.
Such an activity is within parliamentary rules if the MP declares his
connection with the company in the Commons' register of members' interests.
But Labour MPs have pointed out that the practice uses up considerable sums
of public money when too many questions are tabled.
Mr Smith, MP for the very safe seat of Beaconsfield, is an Oxford graduate
who acted as a consultant for a variety of organisations in the 1980s.
A former member of the public accounts committee, the tall old-Harrovian was
once commended by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, for his
'unparalleled expertise on the tax system'.
Before gaining office he held a variety of backbench posts, including
parliamentary private secretary to Sir Leon Brittan.
He is known as a dry wit with a casual charm and an occasionally rowdy sense
of humour.
Mr Smith has made no secret of his role as a consultant for a wide variety
of companies, in particular Price Waterhouse, the accountants.
He has openly declared his relationship with Price Waterhouse and is
understood to have argued that the accountants' rivals learn something from
the answers which ministers provide.
Yesterday the firm confirmed that Mr Smith had acted as a paid consultant
for it and vigorously defended the relationship. It said payments made to Mr
Smith had covered his putting down parliamentary questions on its behalf.
However, it refused to discuss the payments or the exact nature of the
relationship.
'Mr Smith was paid as a consultant which involved him asking questions on
our behalf. That is far removed from being paid to ask questions,' it said.
Labour MPs raised complaints about the way Mr Smith was - quite legally -
asking parliamentary questions in March 1988. He tabled 58 questions in two
days asking ministers for details of computer contracts.
In July 1988, Mr John Marek, a Labour MP, accused Mr Smith of tabling
amendments to the finance bill on behalf of business clients. Two years
later, another Labour MP, the late Bob Cryer, claimed that Mr Smith had
tabled 32 questions on behalf of PW at a cost of about Pounds 3,000 to the
taxpayer.
However, it was the business relationship between 1986 and 1988 with Mr
Mohamed Fayed, House of Fraser chairman, that led to his downfall.
Mr Smith raised questions on behalf of Mr Fayed's interests during the war
with Mr Tiny Rowland, the Lonrho chairman, over the takeover of House of
Fraser in the 1980s.
In April 1986, for example, he is reported to have complained about Mr
Rowland's use of The Observer newspaper to further Lonrho's interests.
Confirmation came yesterday that the relationship had not been officially
declared.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Blair gives Major blueprint for
raising standards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday set out Labour's proposals for raising standards in
public life as he warned Mr John Major that his government was becoming
tainted by allegations of sleaze.
Speaking at prime minister's question time, the Labour leader put forward a
three-point plan to restore 'the confidence of the British people in their
government'.
His move came as it emerged that a future Labour government would probably
force companies to ballot shareholders before making political donations.
Mr Blair's proposals were:
No minister who has privatised a company should subsequently be allowed to
sit on its board.
A list of all members of quangos, payments, perks and any position with any
political party should be published by the government;
The 'cash-for-questions' inquiry should be broadened, 'held in public and be
made fully independent'.
Mr Blair said he noted the resignation of Mr Tim Smith as Northern Ireland
minister and awaited the outcome of investigations into Mr Neil Hamilton.
Earlier Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, said that the party's
general election manifesto would 'be giving serious attention' to the
question of balloting shareholders on the issue of political donations.
Referring to an 'imbalance' in the treatment of political donations from
companies and trade unions, Mr Prescott said it was not a situation that
Labour was 'prepared to allow to continue'.
Meanwhile Labour stepped up its attack on the government over sleaze by
launching a study of links between appointees to quangos and the
Conservative party.
The party said the study showed 'in graphic detail' how government
appointees to quangos were 'inextricably linked' to the financing of the
Conservative party.
Mr George Howarth, MP for Knowsley North who wrote the study, said: 'What is
truly scandalous is that none of these relationships or placements is
actually illegal.'
Labour called for those serving on quangos to be subject to the same
financial liability as local councillors and for the supervisory role of
select committees to be strength-ened.
Arguing that parliamentary scrutiny was no longer enough, Mr Prescott called
for Mr John Major, the prime minister, to set up an independent assessment
of standards of government and public life. The House of Commons' most
influential select committee is set to investigate a controversial decision
to give the vice-chancellor of Huddersfield University a severance payment
of more than Pounds 400,000.
The public accounts committee has received the green light to investigate
the severance payment recently promised to Professor Kenneth Durrands.
The inquiry by the committee will follow one to be carried out by the
National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog. The NAO yesterday
announced that it will carry out a preliminary investigation into the
broader context of the decision to make the payment.

FT  21 OCT 94 / US Mid-term Elections - November 8: California's immigration
campaign tests its strength - A ballot proposing a crackdown on illegal
immigrants leaves even conservatives uncomfortable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The motorist heading south towards the Mexican border blinks twice and slows
down to make sure the eyes are not playing tricks. But a few hundred yards
on there is another one and then another. It is a road sign, all right, but
very different from the familiar walking stick figure that warns of frequent
pedestrian crossings. Instead, there are three figures, a man, a woman and a
child, bent low and running.
It is a road sign which, in theory, would be made redundant if Proposition
187 is approved by the voters of California on November 8, as all the polls
now suggest it will. For this measure, known by its proponents as 'save our
state', is explicitly designed not merely to discourage illegal newcomers
but expose those already here.
The proposition would render 'undocumented aliens' ineligible for state
education and non-emergency health care. It would also require schools and
hospitals to check in advance the immigration status of those seeking
education or hospital treatment and to report to the state each case in
which even 'suspected' illegal residence exists.
The California initiative process - whereby citizens can initiate a state
referendum on particular issues - frequently produces controversy and
sometimes sets national trends. In 1978, Proposition 13, which passed, cut
property taxes deeply, setting the stage for the Reagan administration; in
1990 the environmental movement finally overreached itself with its 'big
green' initiative, which lost.
Proposition 187 is of potentially comparable importance on several counts,
including US relations with its southern neighbour. Mexico's foreign
ministry last month complained of 'racist and xenophobic' overtones in the
California debate and warned that the improvement in commercial and economic
relations brought about by the North American free trade agreement could be
at risk.
But its most immediate impact is domestic. Politically, it is yet another
test of the strength of the resurgent and populist 'America first' movement,
fed up to the back teeth with almost everything, especially government, and
looking for scapegoats, of which the foreign-born almost everywhere have
been a tempting target.
It has become a cause fanned by rightwing talk show hosts and hitherto
obscure organisations like the Federation for American Immigration Reform
(FAIR), whose larger goal often appears to be to keep out everybody. Some
conservatives, however, are rendered uncomfortable. This week Mr Jack Kemp
and Mr Bill Bennett, formerly in the Bush cabinet, condemned the
proposition's 'constitutionally questionable solutions which are not
consonant with our history'.
In California, it pits the federal government, which opposes it, against
Governor Pete Wilson, the moderate Republican who, yet again, has shifted to
the right in an election campaign. His support for it, initially reluctant
but now full-throated, has clearly helped his surge to the front against Ms
Kathleen Brown, his Democrat opponent.
Yet Mr Wilson's strongest constituency, the state business and professional
establishment, is openly nervous about the proposition's consequences.
Typical was an editorial in the conservative Union-Tribune of San Diego,
whose city supervisors last month voted 'an immigrant state of emergency'.
It concluded: 'Before buying into its false promises, voters should take a
good look at the fine print.'
These fears may derive from self-interest, since Californian business,
notably agriculture, has long relied on immigrant labour and has often not
been too particular about documentation. But the fine print was carefully
examined this summer in a report from the office of the legislative analyst
in Sacramento, a non-partisan state agency.
It calculated that more than Dollars 15bn a year of federal health and
education funding to California would be put at risk because of Proposition
187's violation of federal laws. This far exceeded estimated annual savings
of a mere Dollars 200m from reduced public services and even this was partly
offset by the extra cost of verifying residency status, put at 'at least
Dollars 100m' in the first year and 'tens of millions' thereafter, primarily
chargeable to the counties and school districts least able to bear it.
The legal problems are not to be dismissed. A 1982 Supreme Court ruling
requires states to admit the children of illegal immigrants to public
(state) schools under the equal protection amendment to the constitution.
Also, an act of congress orders the severance of federal funds to any school
disclosing confidential information without written parental consent.
The latest salvo against the proposition has come from the medical
profession. A study published on Tuesday by the University of Southern
California saw a real risk to the general population from the spread of
communicable diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis and Aids, if fear of
being reported deters illegal immigrants from seeking medical treatment.
But expert and moral opinion cannot hide under the rug the real and
perceived problem of illegal immigration, especially in California. The
Immigration and Naturalisation Service estimated in April that there were
about 1.6m illegal immigrants in the state, a third of whom had simply
outstayed their tourist and student visas, and that 125,000 more were
arriving each year, mostly from Mexico.
These numbers would have been nothing when California's economic horizons
were limitless, but the state is only now emerging haltingly from the
deepest recession in 60 years. The popular perception, shared, according to
polls, by 50 per cent of legal Hispanic residents, is that scarce resources
are being spent on those who have no right to be here in the first place.
Mr Wilson claims that nearly a tenth (about Dollars 3bn) of the state budget
is now eaten up by the costs of providing healthcare to illegal immigrants
and of educating their 300,000 children. This is why, along with the
governors of Florida and Texas, both also up for re-election, he is suing
Washington to foot the bill. But he concedes that the constitutionality of
Proposition 187, assuming it passes, is bound to be tested in the courts.
There are, of course, other approaches to the problem, including tighter
policing of the border, reinforced again in the past month, and tougher
penalties on companies who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. In August a
federal advisory commission went so far as to recommend a national
computerised employment registry to verify the status of immigrant job
applicants, but was given short shrift by the Clinton administration.
But Proposition 187 offers the public a first crack at the issue.
Ironically, it all began when Mr Ron Prince, a southern Californian
accountant, was enraged after being defrauded by a builder who was an
illegal immigrant. His movement caught fire but somehow lost in the smoke
was one simple fact. The contractor was a Canadian.

<TEXT>
Peru's national electoral board has disqualified the new party of Ms Susana
Higuchi, President Alberto Fujimori's estranged wife, from fielding
candidates in next April's presidential elections. If the decision is
upheld, it will end Ms Higuchi's ambitions of unseating her husband.
Since August the presidential couple have been engaged in a bitter feud. Ms
Higuchi first attacked her husband's policies, and then moved out of the
presidential palace and renounced her role as First Lady to pursue her own
political ambitions.
Under Peruvian law, newly formed parties must present evidence of at least
100,000 supporters. According to the electoral board, fewer than 12,000 of
the 147,000 signatures presented by Harmony 21st Century, Ms Higuchi's
party, were valid.
Ms Higuchi said she would appeal against the board's decision. She has
blamed its computer system for the rejection of her supporters. Many of
them, she said, were women who had signed with their husband's surnames,
which technically invalidated them. She has also called for a march in
support of her party today.
Earlier this week, Ms Higuchi accused Peru's national intelligence service
of attempting to quash her candidacy through 'high-tech fraud'. She claimed
150,000 signatures had been erased from her party's computers during a Lima
power black-out which affected only the block where her campaign offices are
located.
It is not clear whether Ms Higuchi can appeal against the board's decision.
In previous elections, candidates were given leeway to rectify technical
errors and come up with the number of valid signatures required.
But even if she clears this obstacle, Ms Higuchi faces another. A law passed
in July prohibits close relatives of the serving president from standing for
office. Ms Higuchi has already complained to the Organisation of American
States that this law is a violation of the constitutional right of any
Peruvian over the age of 35 to stand for office.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Jump in housing starts fuels inflation fear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp rise in US housing starts and evidence of higher personal incomes
yesterday reawakened market fears of higher interest rates.
Housing construction returned to the high levels of last year with a 4.4 per
cent jump in September to 1.53m units, and personal income rose by 1.9 per
cent in the second quarter, a yearly rate of 7.7 per cent.
Jobless claims for the week ending October 15 fell by 3,000 to 326,000.
Merrill Lynch said the job market remained healthy, but it expected
increases in employment to slow during the fourth quarter.
The figures came the day after US trade figures for August showed a
narrowing of the trade deficit, and record exports of almost Dollars 60bn.
This good news for the 'Main Street' economy alarmed the bond market and
revived expectations of further tightening by the Federal Reserve after the
November 8 mid-term elections.
Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, tried to discourage inflation fears.
Although housing activity has returned to the high levels of last year, he
said, 'this, in conjunction with moderate September increases in consumer
and producer prices, is further evidence that the economy will continue to
expand in the near term with no significant increase in inflation.'
Economists had expected a decline in housing starts. Even more surprising
was a 6.5 per cent increase in recorded building permits in September, a
third consecutive monthly advance. It indicates future strength in the
sector.
The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said mortgage rates averaged 8.68
per cent in September, up from 6.74 per cent a year earlier. The higher
rates had been curbing construction, but some economists believe that these
are being countered by growing employment and income, and expectations of
further rises.
The rebound in housing was led by construction of single family homes.
Building increased in the midwest and west, while slowing in the south and
the north-east. Although starts have fallen since last December, the total
for the first nine months of this year is almost 16 per cent higher than in
1993.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Gatt deal hostage to US voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With smears and sensation-alism outweighing political debate in election
campaigning this year, disillusioned US voters have more on their minds than
the future of the world trading system. But trade officials around the world
are thinking a lot about US voters - and about the special post-election
congressional session that they hope will ratify the Uruguay Round trade
liberalisation deal.
Administration officials, plagued by partisan bickering, had a struggle
getting the Uruguay Round implementing legislation to Congress in time for a
vote this year. In the end Congress went into recess for the November 8
elections before voting on ratification. It will reconvene after the
elections for a rare 'lame duck' session - attended by many retiring members
and by those who failed to win re-election - before the new Congress is
sworn in.
The US is assuring its trade partners the deal will win approval by December
1, in time for launch on January 1 of the World Trade Organisation as
successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Officials
say at the moment pro-Gatt forces have 70 votes in the Senate, 10 more than
needed for passage of the treaty. They also maintain they have at least 260
in the House, where they need 218.
But business lobbyists are uneasy about the uncertain political environment.
Will voters 'throw the rascals out' and vote in populist protectionists?
Will defeated or retiring incumbents be reluctant to vote as 'lame ducks' in
the specially recalled session?
Will incumbents in tight races submit to the demands of the Uruguay Round's
foes by committing themselves to vote against it or promise to delay it
until next year?
Opponents are warning voters the Gatt deal would weaken US sovereignty over
its health, safety and environmental regulations and hurt farmers around the
world. They say trade liberalisation has moved US production abroad.
Playing on public distrust, the anti-Gatt activists portray the 'fast-track'
procedure - frequently used to pass trade deals because it prohibits
congressional tinkering - as an effort to sneak a weighty 4,000-page
agreement through Congress without debate.
Mr Ross Perot and Mr Pat Buchanan, two former presidential candidates, are
leading opposition on the right. On the left are Mr Ralph Nader, the
consumer activist, unions and environmental groups.
'We will do a national targeted effort to urge the candidates to say before
November 8 whether or not they will vote in favour of the Gatt deal,' said
Ms Jane Danowitz of the Citizens Trade Campaign, an umbrella opposition
group.
Mr Chris McGinn, a spokesman for Mr Nader's Public Citizen, said: 'After the
election, we will make the very legitimate point that many people who have
been fired by the voters have no right to vote in a lame duck session.' His
group will monitor departing congressmen and their staffs 'that have a
direct connection to the Gatt' for conflicts of interest as they seek new
jobs.
Meanwhile, big corporations that have been financing the pro-ratification
lobbying efforts have been slow to pledge additional funds.
But in Ohio a coalition of businesses is meeting with congressional
candidates to describe opportunities for their companies provided by the
Gatt deal. Caterpillar is backing a coalition of 263 companies in Illinois.
'The other side is effective at sensationalising trade issues,' says Mr Bill
Lane of Caterpillar. 'What unifies Nader, Buchanan, and Perot isn't
political philosophy. It is that they all believe in protectionism.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Black Sea nations see the trade tide
turning - The region is witnessing big changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the Soviet Union and the emergence of the Caspian Sea region
as one of the most promising oil and gas suppliers in the early 21st century
have profoundly altered the strategic importance and trading potential of
the Black Sea and the newly independent states that surround it.
This week in the Bulgarian Black Sea port of Varna, energy officials from
the 11 member countries of the Black Sea Economic Co-operation group held
their first working meeting. On the agenda was setting up a regional energy
centre, to be based in Sofia, to co-ordinate joint projects.
Mr Charalambos Tsardanidis, director of the Institute of International
Relations in Athens, told a recent meeting of Balkan and Black Sea experts
in Sofia that 'the energy sector is one of the priorities for Black Sea
co-operation, and joint ventures in oil and gas will bring closer links
between our region and the European Union'.
Turning the rhetoric into reality will require considerable political skill,
however. The region is fraught with ancient rivalries, such as that between
Greece and Turkey or those that have led to conflict between ethnic
Armenians and Azeris for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave.
This and other regional conflicts in Chechnya, Abkhazia, Georgia and
elsewhere have allowed Russia to reimpose itself as the regional power in
the Caucasus through 'peace-keeping operations' which many suspect are a way
to reassert control over energy exports from the region.
Moscow's response to the loss of empire is leading to a partial restoration
of its former dominance of the Black Sea. Independence gave Ukraine control
over Odessa and 14 other smaller ports, while the collapse of the Warsaw
Pact ended Soviet influence over Bulgarian and Romanian ports such as
Constanta with its upstream links to central Europe via the Danube.
The collapse of the Soviet empire left Russia with Novorossiysk as its only
Black Sea port of any consequence. Now this port city, which lies at the end
of a Soviet-era pipeline bringing oil for export from the Urals and Caspian
Sea region, is rapidly becoming the key to developments in the region.
Novorossiysk's new-found strategic importance has spawned ambitious
development plans for new pipelines, higher cargo capacity and improved oil
storage and other port facilities. The aim is to make it the principal
export harbour for the sharply higher oil and gas volumes expected to start
flowing early in the next century. For this to happen, however, the
international oil and gas companies still have to reach agreement on both
the exploitation and transport of the vast reserves known to exist under the
Caspian Sea, in Kazakhstan and elsewhere in central Asia.
Until now most Russian export oil has been shipped in huge tankers through
the Bosporus. But a series of accidents and growing ecological concerns led
Turkey in July to restrict tanker traffic along the busy and vulnerable
waterway. Reluctant to lose out from the expected growth of oil traffic,
however, Ankara is busy promoting a new oil pipeline to connect the Black
Sea with the eastern Mediterranean.
But Russia has already made its own preferences clear by signing letters of
intent earlier this month with Greece and Bulgaria for the construction of a
350km pipeline costing Dollars 700m-Dollars 800m and capable of transporting
more than 40m tons of oil from the Bulgarian port of Burgas to
Alexandroupolis, a Greek port on the Aegean. This week Greek and Bulgarian
businessmen discussed plans for a new motorway from Alexandroupolis through
Varna to Romania, Ukraine and Russia.
The outgoing Bulgarian government also approved a Russian-Bulgarian joint
venture project to build a transit gas pipeline which could deliver more
than 20bn cu metres of gas annually to Turkey, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and
on to western Europe.
Under the transit gas agreement, Russia's Gazprom would take a 50 per cent
stake alongside a group of Bulgarian state-owned companies. Under Russian
pressure the Bulgarian side will put into the joint venture an existing
pipeline network built under earlier agreements with the former Soviet
Union. This has been criticised for making Bulgaria dependent on a single
gas supplier. Domestic critics have also attacked the outgoing government's
decision to allow full tax relief on the proposed joint venture company,
which is subject to approval by the new parliament after the December 18
elections.
Meanwhile, Russia's choice of fellow-Slav Bulgaria as its main partner for
future energy and other co-operation is underpinning ambitious plans for
port developments at both Varna and Burgas.
Mr Dimitar Alexiev, the captain of Burgas port, has drawn up a Dollars 250m
development plan with technical assistance from Barcelona and Hamburg. It
calls for a four stage expansion and modernisation of its container,
roll-on-roll-off (ro-ro) facilities, bigger coal and ore terminals and
expansion of the oil terminals which at present can only accommodate
80,000dwt tankers, compared with 250,000dwt at its arch-rival Constanta.
The shift in Bulgarian trade away from 80 per cent dependence on the Soviet
and Comecon markets five years ago to more than 50 per cent trade with OECD
markets this year has already brought newcomers such as South African ore
carriers and American coal ships to the harbour. Bulgarian ports also now
handle the bulk of trade with Macedonia following the Greek blockade of the
landlocked republic.
The re-emergence of the Black Sea as an important link in growing trade
between Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East is particularly important
for Bulgaria and is not confined to future energy trade or links with the
former Soviet states.
Earlier this year Iran signed a protocol to ship 3.5m tons of cargo a year
through the expanded ro-ro facilities planned for a new Burgas terminal. For
political reasons Tehran is determined to avoid dependence on Turkey and
plans to import 6m-7m tons annually through Burgas and other Black Sea ports
by the end of the century. The plan is to ship cargo from Europe and
elsewhere across the Black Sea to Poti and then truck it through Georgia and
Azerbaijan.
Rover, the UK-based subsidiary of the German BMW group, has been among the
first western companies to spot the potential for manufacturing in the
region. Last month it decided to set up a car plant at a dockside site near
Varna that will import knocked down components by ship from the UK and
export assembled cars to markets around the Black Sea rim.

The private sector will provide about 14 per cent of the total
infrastructure finance needed in developing countries by the end of the
decade, with governments continuing to be the main source of funds,
according to World Bank officials at the World Infrastructure Forum (Asia)
in Jakarta. Although there is unlikely to be a shortage of cash as
governments inject new life into existing infrastructure funds, 'projects
will be chasing money, not money chasing projects,' said Mr Gregory Ingram,
administrator of the research advisory staff at the World Bank. Capital
markets are expected to become a significant source for financing, and
infrastructure funds, credit rating and credit guarantee facilities are
being established throughout the region to help secure loans from commercial
lenders. Countries such as Vietnam and China, which lack a well-developed
legal framework, are likely to face the biggest obstacles in securing
financing from the private sector, delegates at the forum said.

<TEXT>
The US Export-Import Bank expects to increase sharply its concessional
finance to China to help US business gain access to the world's
fastest-growing market. Mr Kenneth Brody, chairman of Eximbank, yesterday
said that China had, in fiscal year 1994, become the bank's biggest customer
in Asia. Financing of US exports this year to China had reached Dollars
1.3bn, against Dollars 800m in fiscal 1993 - a 63 per cent increase. Mr
Brody noted that the bank had applications pending for additional financing
of Dollars 3.3bn. He expected priority areas for US business would continue
to be the power sector, aircraft sales, airport construction, air traffic
control facilities and equipment for aircraft.
This was the first vist to China of a US Eximbank chairman for eight years,
and it reflects growing US determination to penetrate the Chinese market. Mr
Brody said that under the Clinton administration there had been a
significant change of policy. 'The US government is going to help US
companies to compete and win in the global market place.' He said there was
'no limit' on Eximbank lending to China within the bank's guidelines, which
include provision for project financing and financing of exports of consumer
goods, spare parts, raw materials, bulk agricultural commodities and
quasi-capital goods. Mr Brody said his bank was seeking to develop closer
relations with Chinese institutions, including the State Development Bank.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Norway wary of gas pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Norway is increasingly reluctant to participate in the construction of a gas
pipeline, the interconnector, linking Britain to Belgium and creating a
single market for European gas. Bids outlining equity requirements and space
allocation are due for submission on November 28. Proposals covering
ownership agreements and financing arrangements are expected to go out soon
to companies interested in the project.
An interconnector study group - comprising British Gas, British Petroleum,
Conoco of the US, Distrigaz of Belgium, Elf Aquitaine of France and Norway's
Norsk Hydro and Statoil - has been studying the feasibility of the proposed
pipeline. But Norway's gas exporters are questioning the benefits of
participating in the project because of tariffs on routing their gas through
the UK grid to Europe. Norsk Hydro said in August that it was not interested
in joining the project. When the Europipe trunkline to Germany comes on
stream next year, four gas export systems will run from Norway; three to the
continent and one to the UK.
Once plans for two additional export lines are realised - to cover
substantial additional gas exports to Germany and France - the length of
Norway's gas transit highway will be 5,600km, the largest submarine system
in the world. The Norwegians are also frustrated by the British government's
unwillingness to allow reverse-flow through the interconnector from the
continent to the UK. They also claim the British government is linking
participation in the interconnector with UK imports of Norwegian gas under
existing contracts with Britain's National Power and Scottish Power.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China appears intent on slowing progress towards agreement on an
Asia-Pacific free trade zone pending resolution of its dispute with the US
over membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the
granting of unconditional Most Favoured Nation trading status.
Mr Li Zhongzhou, director-general of the Department of International Trade
and Economic Relations, yesterday indicated that Beijing would use the Apec
card to exert pressure on the US in Gatt negotiations. China objects to
continued US refusal to grant unconditional MFN as part of a Gatt agreement
and says this violates a 'fundamental principle' of international trade.
'China is basically in favour of trade liberalisation, but on the condition
that we enjoy the same kind of privileges as other members of Apec,' said Mr
Li just weeks before leaders of member economies are due to meet in
Indonesia to discuss the free trade zone proposal.
China is locked in difficult discussions with the US on Gatt accession, with
the Americans demanding further trade liberalisation as the price of entry.
Washington has also made it clear that US law prevents it granting China
unconditional MFN.
Mr Li said members of Apec should proceed cautiously in trade
liberalisation. 'Taking into account the diversity of the economies in this
region it may not work properly if you take a decision to liberalise
immediately.'
He was commenting on an Australian proposal that would turn the Asia-Pacific
region into a free trade zone by the year 2020. Australia hopes the Apec
meeting scheduled to begin on November 14 will endorse such an aim.
The Chinese official indicated acceptance in principle of Australia's
proposal for an Asia-Pacific free trade zone, but stressed that China's
acquiescence would be linked with Gatt accession and a resolution of the MFN
issue.
China and the US have been negotiating terms for Gatt entry since August
following presentation of a 900-page Chinese proposal to a working party in
Geneva. US officials say progress has been made, but 'more work' is required
on such issues as tariff reduction and market liberalisation.
Beijing is anxious to be a founder member of the World Trade Organisation
when it succeeds Gatt either on January 1 or July 1 next year. But Mr Li
warned that China would find it difficult to make further concessions on key
issues.
'We have negotiated for eight years,' he observed. 'If the contracting
parties are not ready to accept China, it might be better for us to say
there is no use pursuing this further. . . We would then do whatever we deem
necessary to accelerate our economic development.'

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Rover signs deal with Malaysia - T Series
engine may be manufactured under licence for use in Proton cars

<TEXT>
Rover, the leading UK carmaker, and Proton, the Malaysian car producer,
yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding which could lead to the
manufacture of Rover engines under licence in Malaysia.
Rover, a subsidiary of BMW of Germany, said that the two carmakers would
investigate the manufacture of its T Series 2.0 litre petrol engine in
Malaysia for use in Proton cars. The agreement would cover the transfer of
technology to Proton, including future developments of the T Series engine
range as well as the training of Proton employees in engine assembly and
installation.
The memorandum of understanding with Proton follows Rover's final agreement
earlier this month with Kia, the second largest South Korean carmaker, for
the joint development of a new range of V6 engines which will be built in
the UK and in Korea.
Proton, which last year produced 117,000 cars, would use the Rover engine in
its larger cars for sale in the domestic market and for export.
Proton started producing cars in the mid-1980s in co-operation with
Mitsubishi of Japan. Mitsubishi initially held a 30 per cent stake in Proton
but through various restructurings that has been reduced to around 20 per
cent.
While Proton boasts that its car now has a domestic content level of more
than 70 per cent, high cost components such as transmission systems are
still imported from Japan.
The Malaysians have become frustrated at what they consider to be Japanese
unwillingness to transfer technology. They have also been concerned about
cost increases following the rise in the value of the yen.
Mr Mohamad Nadzmi, head of Proton, said that Mitsubishi could be affected in
the short term, but as a Proton shareholder the Japanese conglomerate would
benefit from an improvement in the Malaysian company's profitability.
Proton has a 73 per cent share of the Malaysian market and exported 17,000
cars last year, mostly to Britain.
Rover is believed to be in the final stages of negotiating the sale of up to
4,000 of its Land Rover vehicles to the Malaysian armed forces. Rover is
also discussing collaborative ventures in Indonesia.
Hawtal Whiting, a leading UK automotive design and engineering consultancy,
yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with Bakti Muhibbah, a
Malaysian land development company, to conduct a feasibility study into a
joint venture high technology business park in the state of Negeri Sembilan.

FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Tariff cuts 'will stabilise world food
markets'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The Uruguay Round trade accords will lead to more stable world food markets
in the coming decades and open up important new markets for efficient
agricultural producers, according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
The Gatt secretariat, which has analysed the impact of reductions in tariffs
and other farm trade barriers negotiated over the eight years of talks, says
new market opportunities will be of particular value to developing countries
exporting temperate food products where protection in the industrialised
world has been greatest.
Developed countries, which account for about two-thirds of world imports of
farm products, will cut tariffs by an average of 37 per cent over six years,
according to Gatt's calculations. Above average tariff cuts will apply to
oilseeds, flowers and plants and below average reductions to sugar and dairy
products, with other tariffs declining by close to the average.
For tropical products - which comprise half the agricultural exports of
developing nations - the average tariff reduction will be 43 per cent. Under
the terms of the Uruguay Round farm trade accord, countries agreed to
convert all import restrictions into tariffs and reduce those tariffs by at
least 36 per cent over six years for industrialised countries and 24 per
cent over 10 years for developing countries.
Gatt says minimum market access commitments by countries which previously
had closed markets will boost coarse grain imports by 1.76m tons and rice
imports by 1.08m tons. Total outlays on domestic support for farmers will
fall by 18 per cent from Dollars 197bn to Dollars 162bn.
In addition, export subsidies will be cut by 36 per cent from Dollars 21.3bn
to Dollars 13.7bn by the end of the transition period. These reductions will
bear most heavily on highly subsidised products such as wheat, beef, coarse
grains, dairy products and sugar, Gatt points out. The quantities of exports
that can be legally subsidised will be reduced by 21 per cent. During
1986-90, developed countries subsidised annually on average 48.2m tons of
wheat, 19.5m tons of coarse grains, 1.8m tons of sugar and 1.2m tons of
beef.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Sweeping changes in South African broadcasting:
Controversial cut in use of Afrikaans likely to provoke serious backlash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK SUZMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South African Broadcasting Corporation, the state-run body which has a
virtual monopoly on radio and television broadcasting in South Africa,
yesterday announced plans for sweeping changes to its structure, including a
significant reduction in the use of Afrikaans on the airwaves.
The decision is controversial and likely to provoke a substantial backlash
from a large part of the Afrikaner population.
Many of them will take it as proof of their continued marginalisation in
South African society since the April elections.
It may also prove a potent future election issue for right-wing political
parties.
Announcing the changes at a Johannesburg press conference yesterday, Mr
Zwelakhe Sisulu, the recently-appointed SABC Group chief executive, said
that on television English would become the most widely-used language.
All main news broadcasts will become evenly divided between English,
Afrikaans, the Nguni group of African languages (which include Zulu and
Xhosa), and the Sotho group of languages.
Under the present system, SABC's main television channel, TV1, splits its
broadcasts evenly between English and Afrikaans, while black languages are
relegated to the broadcaster's other two channels, CCV and NNTV.
Mr Sisulu also said that radio services will be restructured to create 11,
full-spectrum public-service stations, one for each of the country's
official languages.
As a result, there will only be one station that will continue to broadcast
exclusively in Afrikaans. Several smaller, regional stations that at present
use Afrikaans are likely to close or to be restructured.
The proposed downgrading of Afrikaans, rumoured for several months, has been
widely condemned by Afrikaans cultural and political groups, who charge it
violates another constitutional clause forbidding any 'diminishing of the
rights and status of existing languages'.
The proposed changes will also almost certainly mean the retrenchment of
hundreds of Afrikaans-speaking staffers at SABC and their replacement with
blacks capable of running the new African-language programming, a move which
will help the corporation attain its stated goal of 50 per cent black
staffing by 1998.
Mr Daan van der Merwe, arts and culture spokesman for the Conservative
party, claimed the move signalled a plan to undermine Afrikaans language and
culture.
Mr Sisulu said he was aware the decision might prove controversial, but
argued that given the strictures of the new constitution, which stipulates
'equal use and enjoyment' of all South Africa's official languages, the new
proposals represent the most feasible compromise.
Underlying the language issue is the deeper question of whether SABC will be
able to transform itself into a genuinely independent public broadcaster in
the mould of Britain's BBC, or whether it will become merely a mouthpiece
for the current ANC-led government.
During the apartheid years, the broadcaster was an effective propaganda
instrument wielded by the former government, adroitly manipulating
television and radio news to reflect its vision of South Africa. Since the
accession to power of former President F W de Klerk in 1989, the
organisation has been trying to transform itself into a genuinely
representative national broadcaster, with a firm commitment to freedom of
expression and freedom of the press, a goal officially supported by the
present government.
But critics charge that the corporation's new board and management are far
too closely aligned to the ANC to be the architects of a reformed,
independent institution.
Mr Sisulu, whose father, Mr Walter Sisulu, is ANC deputy-president, was a
long-time ANC activist and formerly edited the ANC-supporting newspaper New
Nation.
Other board members, including the chairman, Dr Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, are
known to have ANC sympathies.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Tokyo risks Beijing anger over Taiwan

<TEXT>
Japan yesterday courted Chinese displeasure for the second time in a month,
by announcing plans to hold its first formal ministerial meeting with Taiwan
in 22 years.
Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's minister of international trade and industry,
is to meet Mr Chiang Ping-kun, Taiwan's economics minister, in Osaka on
Saturday, in the margins of a conference on small businesses in Asia.
The move is the latest in a series of recent examples of Japan's search for
a more self-assertive foreign policy line. On this occasion, Tokyo's
confidence could be a reflection of the fact that China is seeking the
renewal and enlargement of a six-year Y800bn (Pounds 5.2bn) programme of
Japanese government loans, ending in 1996.
Tokyo showed itself prepared to confront Beijing on the same issue of
relations with Taiwan earlier this month, when it allowed Mr Hsu Li Teh,
Taiwan's deputy prime minister, to visit the Asian games in Hiroshima. Mr
Hsu ignored his hosts' requests to keep a discreet profile and met
politicians from the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Officially, Mr Hashimoto and Mr Chiang will talk about small business
policy, in an attempt to present the meeting as politically uncontroversial.
Miti officials said they believed China would have no grounds to object,
since Mr Hashimoto will also meet counterparts from China, Hong Kong, the
Philippines and Indonesia. They will attend the conference in their capacity
as members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum.
Japan cut formal diplomatic links with Taiwan in 1972, when it opened
relations with China, thereby implying acceptance of China's belief that
Taiwan is part of China. Yet there is an influential pro-Taiwan faction in
the Japanese government.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Cambodian sacking greeted with dismay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN MILLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PHNOM PENH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Less than a week after the Cambodian government launched a Dollars 1m
(Pounds 666,000) campaign to attract foreign investors, the architect of the
country's economic reform programme, Mr Sam Rainsy, finance minister, was
sacked in a Cabinet reshuffle yesterday.
His removal from office was greeted with dismay by Cambodians and
nervousness by potential investors and donors, impressed by Mr Rainsy's
vision for the development of the war-ravaged economy.
'This is a real shame,' said one foreign businessman in Phnom Penh. 'Sam
Rainsy has undoubtedly been the best of all the people I've had to deal with
in this government.'
King Norodom Sihanouk, who rules Cambodia's 7m people, evidently shared this
view. In recent letters of support for Mr Rainsy, he said: 'Our nation and
our people greatly need your highly patriotic and competent services'.
A large majority in Cambodia's National Assembly voted in favour of the
shake-up after it was presented for approval by the senior prime minister,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh. He said the changes were aimed at forging greater
unity among parties in the ruling coalition which is largely comprised of
royalists and former Communists.
Before returning to Cambodia to join the government, Mr Rainsy had spent 27
years in France, where he worked as an accountant and stockbroker. He gave
that up for a government salary of Dollars 30 a month.
Mr Rainsy appears to have been a victim of his own success. His popularity
among voters at home and the stature he had gained abroad worried his
political masters, who thought him a threat. His determination to root out
endemic corruption also made him many enemies in the government, the private
sector and in the armed forces.
A western diplomat said: 'Let's face it, if you're serious about a Cabinet
reshuffle, there are lots more obvious candidates for the chop'.
In a reflection of local business concerns, there was steady buying of gold
by investors, mostly Chinese, on the 24-hour foreign exchange-precious
metals market in Phnom Penh.
When Mr Rainsy assumed the portfolio in July last year, he inherited what he
liked to describe as 'a free-for-all jungle economy', which had failed to
recover from the economic ruin wrought by the Khmer Rouge regime in the
1970s and a subsequent decade of mismanagement.
He was determined to dismantle the cumbersome state apparatus of a crumbling
centrally-planned economy and reintegrate Cambodia with the global economy.
He stressed fiscal prudence and accountability, and pinned his hopes on
private entrepreneurship and the free market.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, he said: 'My vision consists
of seeing Cambodia become part of the east Asian economic miracle. I hope
that within 10 or 15 years we will catch up with our neighbouring
countries'.
If the international and multilateral donors who listened to his message
thought Mr Rainsy a touch optimistic, they enthusiastically bought his line.
After he addressed a donors' meeting in Tokyo in March, Dollars 500m was
pledged towards national reconstruction. This came on top of the Dollars 1bn
pledged by donors after the Cambodian Peace Agreement in Paris two years
ago.
The foreign business community has been equally impressed by Mr Rainsy's
efforts to create a more stable environment for foreign investment. His
record, after just one year, is impressive.
He was behind the Foreign Investment Law, passed in July. He helped to
control inflation, stabilised the Cambodian currency, the Riel, centralised
revenue collection and brought the government's huge deficit under control.
The question now is whether his successor can protect the policies Mr Rainsy
set in place. He is Mr Keat Chhon, a French-trained nuclear physicist, and,
like many members of today's government, an erstwhile official with the
former Khmer Rouge regime.
For the past year, he has headed the Cambodian Development Council, whose
remit is the promotion of foreign investment. Investors and diplomats are
reserving judgment. One foreign businessman said: 'Keat Chhon's impressive,
intelligent and capable. The next couple of months will be crucial from a
business perspective. We'll all be watching and waiting'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African Housing Ministry and the Association of Mortgage Lenders,
a group of big banks and building societies, have announced a R2bn (Pounds
350m) plan to open up mortgage loans to the lower end of the housing market.
The plan, which will provide for up to 50,000 loans worth R10,000 in its
first year of operation, represents the first big initiative by government
and the private sector to combat South Africa's huge housing shortage.
The government has agreed to indemnify banks for the first three years of
the programme in case of a breakdown in law enforcement that would prevent
them repossessing the property of defaulters.
The new plan appears to indicate that broad agreement on how to implement
the policy has now been reached and further initiatives are expected to be
unveiled next week at a planned National Housing Summit in Botshabelo,
Orange Free State.
Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary-general, yesterday denied reports he was
planning to step down from his post at the party's planned national
conference in December.
Mr Ramaphosa was responding to press speculation that he was tired of
political life.

North Korea's mission in Geneva today will host the signing of the nuclear
pact with the US, completed earlier this week. The pact, hailed by President
Bill Clinton as presaging the isolated communist country's full entry into
the world community, was earlier formally endorsed by the North's new
leader, Kim Jong-il. The ceremony will formalise an emerging relationship
between Washington and Pyongyang, committing the North to improve ties with
South Korea. Under the deal, North Korea freezes, then dismantles its
current nuclear programme in return for a pledge of compensation in the form
of oil for lost energy, and delivery over the next few years of new and
safer nuclear plant.

The US and Britain formally warned Iraq last night that any further threat
to Kuwait through troop movements beyond the 32nd parallel would be met by
force. The two powers acted, in demarches by their UN ambassadors, in a
follow-up to last weekend's Security Council resolution demanding complete
withdrawal of troops Iraq deployed in setting off the recent crisis.
Diplomats said France was expected to issue a parallel warning but probably
not threaten a specific military res-ponse, since it had not interpreted the
resolution as auth-orising a further use of force. The US and Britain told
Iraq's UN delegate they were ready to 'respond appropriately and decisively'
to any new threat.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's money supply grew 2.3 per cent year-on-year in September, slightly
faster than expected. The rise, in M2 plus certificates of deposit, is a
gentle acceleration compared with a 1.9 per cent increase in the money
supply in August. It shows the squeeze on credit may be easing, though money
supply is still weak compared to the late 1980s period of high economic
growth. The rate of increase in money supply eased from May to June, but has
been gently gathering pace ever since. A broader measure of liquidity, also
including postal savings, government bonds and investment trusts, rose 3.5
per cent last month, a slight easing in pace from the 3.6 per cent increase
in August. This remains well below the 5 per cent annual growth several
economic analysts in Tokyo believe is the minimum needed to fund a durable
economic recovery.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Nigerian currency falls 12% in week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The street value of the Nigerian naira has plunged 12 per cent against the
dollar in the past week which has seen the sacking of Mr Kalu Kalu, the
county's finance minister.
Since Mr Kalu's dismissal last Monday night, the parallel rate of the naira
has fallen to N90, the latest symptom of a deepening economic crisis.
General Sani Abacha, who seized power last November, has reversed seven
years of free market reforms backed by the IMF and the World Bank. Mr Kalu
was a former World Bank economist and an architect of Nigeria's reforms.
Bankers blame the devaluation on the erratic supply of foreign exchange on
the official market. Since January the government has cut the budget for
foreign exchange allocations at the official rate of N22 to the dollar from
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to Dollars 1.9bn.
Junior foreign minister Anthony Ani assumed duties as acting finance
minister yesterday and told the IMF to let Nigeria find its own solutions to
its economic problems.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
New Zealand's prime minister Jim Bolger yesterday vowed that his National
party would continue in power till the next elections due in 1996, in spite
of boundary changes that will cost many of his MPs their seats.
Some National party MPs are expected to form new political parties which
could threaten the government's two-seat majority. The boundary changes, a
result of the German-style electoral system under which the next elections
are due to be held, reduce the number of electorates to 60 from the present
95.
Under the new proportional system, the remaining seats will be on a list
basis with MPs nominated by political parties.
Many sitting MPs, including Mr Bolger and deputy prime minister Don
McKinnon, say they intend to seek election and will not accept nomination
for the party lists for the next parliament.
The detailed boundary changes announced yesterday pose severe problems for
the government. The reduction in seats leaves a number of prominent cabinet
ministers, such as justice minister Doug Graham and consumer affairs
minister Katharine O'Regan, without seats.
The change to the electoral system has already led to two resignations.
Junior minister Ross Meurant and Labour's Peter Dunne have left their
present parties and announced they will stand under new labels in the next
election. Both have said they will support Mr Bolger through what is
expected to be a turbulent time in New Zealand politics.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Foreign banks wishing to start up in the Philippines under next year's
liberalisation will need capital of only 210m pesos (Pounds 5m), but must
come from countries offering reciprocal rights of establishment to
Philippine institutions, guidelines published by the Monetary Board say.
Thirty-one foreign banks have expressed interest in setting up shop,
following the passage of legislation opening up the banking sector for the
first time in 46 years. The change is expected to intensify competition in
the financial sector.
Only 10 banks will be allowed to open full-service branches, although others
may acquire up to 60 per cent of existing banks, including those under
receivership or liquidation. Mr Gabriel Singson, head of the central bank
and its policy-setting Monetary Board, says the selection should be
completed in early 1995. Six of the 10 banks will be selected by the board,
while the other four will be picked by the Philippine president.
The newly issued rules limit the selection to the top five banks in their
home countries. They can open up to three branches in any location, and
another three in areas to be designated by the Monetary Board. Foreign banks
seeking the right to engage in securities businesses will need total capital
of at least 1.5bn pesos, the same as domestic banks.
Four foreign banks already operating in the Philippines, Bank of America,
Citibank, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered,
were established before overseas involvement was banned.
Bankers say Manila has begun to offer more sophisticated services since

China expects to conduct 'a few more' nuclear tests before it joins an
international moratorium on experimental atomic blasts, an official said
yesterday. Beijing has said it favours a complete ban on all nuclear arms,
but until a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is concluded, will refuse
to join in a two-year-old moratorium adopted by the world's other declared
nuclear powers. The official said his government did not want to see the
nuclear weapons gap between China and other nuclear powers 'frozen forever',
leaving Beijing vulnerable to attack. More tests were needed to improve the
quality of new devices.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Hualon is a 'victim of hearsay': Laura Tyson interviews
chief of Taiwanese textile company linked to share controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA TYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hualon-Teijran, the Taiwanese textile manufacturer, is determined to proceed
with plans to build a plant in Northern Ireland with financial help from the
British government, despite the recent share payment default controversy to
which the company has been linked.
Mr Liang Ching-hsiung, president of the Taiwan-listed company, in an
interview depicted Hualon-Teijran as having fallen 'victim to hearsay' in
this and previous scandals that have plagued its founding Oung family,
maverick scions of a Shanghai textile dynasty.
Mr Liang sought to distance the company he runs from other companies
associated with Mr Oung Ta-ming, the focus of attention in the share scandal
earlier this month involving 28 securities firms and TDollars 7.6bn (Pounds
182m) in defaults.
He also sought to dispel concerns that Hualon-Teijran's Pounds 157m
investment project near Belfast, undertaken with Pounds 61m in UK government
aid, would go the way of an earlier state-subsidised project in Northern
Ireland, the De-Lorean car factory, which collapsed in the early 1980s.
'Hualon has always been a solid, dedicated manufacturing operation, not a
speculative company,' Mr Liang said. 'I particularly want to emphasise that
our company has no relations whatsoever with Oung Ta-ming or his securities
businesses and we know absolutely nothing about his share trading
activities. In fact, all we know is what we read in the newspapers, like
everyone else.'
Mr Oung, a Taiwanese legislator and prominent share speculator, founded and
built up a loosely knit group of companies now reckoned to be Taiwan's tenth
biggest industrial group. Control is split among Mr Oung and three younger
brothers.
Mr Liang, who has worked at Hualon-Teijran since 1968, described the history
and structure of the group in an effort to clarify what he regarded as
misconceptions about the management of and relationship among companies
within the group.
He also presented Hualon-Teijran's version of events preceding a 1991
share-bribery scandal which led to the downfall of a cabinet minister. Mr
Oung You-ming, the third Oung brother and
chairman of Hualon-Teijran, left Taiwan after the scandal broke and has not
returned to face charges in connection with the case. He now runs Hualon's
businesses in Malaysia.
Mr Liang said the case was politicised and Mr Oung You-ming will ultimately
be found innocent. 'When the timing is right, Oung You-ming will of course
return to Taiwan, but at the moment he has no concrete plans to do so.'
Unlike other Taiwanese family run conglomerates such as Formosa Plastics and
Koo's Group, the Oung family companies do not have a central holding company
or centralised management and finances, Mr Liang said. Thus the term 'Hualon
group' is actually a misnomer as the various entities have always been run
independently, despite the fact that until the late 1980s family members
sometimes held positions in more than one company.
Mr Liang said that 1989 'marked a very important milestone for the family
and for the businesses. At that point, Oung Ta-ming went into
semi-retirement. He no longer wanted to have anything to do with the
manufacturing side, so he let his brothers take over those businesses.'
When Mr Oung You-ming took over Hualon-Teijran he began to look for
opportunities to expand overseas and diversify. In 1990 the Taiwan
government began offering financial incentives for investment in
high-technology industries.
Mr Liang said the younger Mr Oung wanted to take advantage of those
incentives, but by law the consolidated investments of a listed company
could not exceed 40 per cent of total registered capital. (This restriction
was lifted in 1991.)
To comply, Hualon-Teijran decided to sell 5m shares in Kuo Hwa Life
Insurance. As Kuo Hwa is an unlisted concern, bidders could not be solicited
publicly. Mr Oung tried to sell the shares privately to other tycoons, but
none was interested given that the stock exchange index's fall from 12,000
in February 1990 to around 3,000 in October.
The shares were sold in December 1990 to the daughter of Mr Clement Chang,
minister of transportation and communications at the time, for TDollars 120
a share, compared with Mr Oung's original asking price of TDollars 150 a
share. The shares were estimated by accountants to have a net asset value of
TDollars 80.
Regulators were notified of the transaction and a public announcement was
made, as required by law. Authorities made no objection to the sale, Mr
Liang said. 'We were trying our best as a law-abiding company to abide by
the law of the country,' he said.
In February 1991 Mr Hsu Rong-chi, a self-styled expert on the insurance
industry, filed a suit against the sale, claiming that the shares were worth
TDollars 500-TDollars 800 each, Mr Liang said. (Through his underground
radio station, Mr Hsu this year mobilised Taipei cab drivers on several
occasions to pro
test against the ruling party. He was convicted last month of using the
airwaves to incite violent demonstrations and sentenced to eight months in
jail.)
Mr Oung was temporarily prevented from leaving the country by prosecutors,
but the restriction was lifted later. He subsequently left Taiwan legally
and did not 'skip bail' as is widely believed, Mr Liang said.
Hualon-Teijran's shares are widely dispersed among 180,000 shareholders. Mr
Oung You-ming holds 3 per cent and Kuo Hwa Life Insurance 8 per cent.
The company forecasts pre-tax profits of TDollars 1.15bn on turnover of
TDollars 27bn in 1994, against a loss of TDollars 384m in 1993.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Choice for Berlusconi: Government adopts conflict of
interest proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government yesterday decided to adopt unchanged the legislation
proposed by three jurists to resolve the conflict of interest between the
prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and his Fininvest media empire.
The legislation means that Mr Berlusconi must choose between selling off his
assets or appointing a special administrator as a trustee to run Fininvest,
Italy's second largest private group. His media interests will also be
monitored by the parliament-appointed media watchdog commission.
Mr Berlusconi formally cut his managerial ties with Fininvest in January
when he entered politics, but has so far failed to make any provision to
prevent a conflict of interest. He has consistently stated he is averse to
selling his assets, but it remains to be seen how an administrator will fit
into the management structure of Fininvest, which is spread over television,
publishing, financial products and retailing.
The three jurists, who proposed the legislation in a 400-page report
submitted at the end of September, were appointed by Mr Berlusconi in May.
Their report was judged a positive first step by the opposition but they
criticised the legislation as being incomplete.
They claim the cards are stacked in Mr Berlusconi's favour because
parliament controls appointments to the media watchdog commission.
Two incidents yesterday underlined the continued problems of conflict of
interest.
The first was a debate in the higher magistrate's council, governing body of
the judiciary, over whether to censure the behaviour of the chief public
prosecutor of Milan who is investigating Fininvest. Mr Vittorio Sgroi, head
of the appeals court, had to explain at length that a meeting he had held on
Wednesday with Mr Berlusconi over the affair had not involved an attempt by
the owner of Fininvest to exert pressure on the outcome of the censure
meeting. The council later decided to take no action against Mr Francesco
Saverio Borrelli, a senior magistrate who sparked a furore by hinting that a
corruption probe into a pay television network might involve Mr Berlusconi.
The second incident was a debate in parliament on the future of the Rai, the
state broadcasting organisation.
An opposition member hurled abuse and accused the government of monopolising
information through Fininvest channels and control of the Rai. Fights broke
out when several members from government benches stormed towards the
opposition.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Divisions within the government of Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi
are holding up the approval of Mr Vincenzo Desario as the new director of
the Bank of Italy.
In an unprecedented move by an Italian government, the right-wing coalition
has refused to welcome the nomination on Monday by the bank's governing
council of Mr Desario, currently the deputy-director, to take over the
number two job.
Instead the government has deliberately chosen to take its time. The matter
was not discussed at yesterday's cabinet meeting. Mr Gianni Letta, the head
of the prime minister's office, said the matter would be discussed at the
next cabinet meeting and insisted that the government was united in the view
that an external candidate would have been preferred.
Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Northern League and a key
member of the coalition, said when asked about the delay: 'It was a choice
made autonomously by the Bank of Italy and which doesn't seem to please the
government nor the perhaps the treasury, with whom the bank has to work.'
Mr Desario was chosen on the advice of Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor, to
take up the position vacated by Mr Lamberto Dini, when he left in May to
become treasury minister. Mr Fazio insisted on an internal candidate and
after five months' wrangling appeared to have brokered a deal last weekend
with the government via the good offices of Mr Guiseppe Tatarella, the
deputy prime minister and leading member of the neo-fascist MSI/National
Alliance in the coalition.
The choice of Mr Desario has been openly backed by MSI/National Alliance and
the Christian Democratic Centre, the smallest group in the coalition. The
League has wavered and Mr Berlusconi and his Forza Italia have been silent.
Mr Berlusconi and more particularly Mr Dini, are reportedly still reluctant
to accept the bank's ability to choose the members of the four-man
directorate. From the start, Mr Berlusconi has made it clear he regards this
as a separate issue from the central bank's autonomy. The Desario
appointment requires the endorsement of both President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
and the cabinet. The president is understood to support Mr Fazio.
The government thus has three main courses of action: simply delay to
display disapproval; delay and issue a statement of censure; reject the
appointment. Political analysts doubted yesterday whether there was
sufficient consensus in the government to refuse the appointment as this
would exacerbate the conflict with the Bank of Italy and antagonise
President Scalfaro. It would also unnerve the markets.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Basque poll may allow Eta to follow IRA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BILBAO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Northern Ireland peace process could have a knock-on effect on Spain's
Basque Country where regional elections on Sunday are widely viewed as
setting the stage for similar negotiations to end violence by Eta, the
separatist organisation.
The vote among the 2.1m Basques, who since 1979 have enjoyed increasing home
rule, is also seen as a watershed poll that could undermine the nationalist
rhetoric and extremist calls for secession from Spain that has dominated
much of local politics.
Opinion polls indicate that the Partido Nacionalista Vasco, PNV, the
mainstream nationalist party, will remain the dominant force but that there
will be big gains by Madrid-based parties - the conservative People's party
(PP) and the communist coalition, Izquierda Unida (IU) - which had formerly
been on the sidelines of Basque politics.
'I believe that once the elections are over,' says Jon Idigoras, a veteran
leader of Herri Batasuna (HB), the radical Basque group that acts as Eta's
political front organisation, 'there will be contacts with Eta and any one
of us in HB can play the role of Gerry Adams (the leader of Ireland's Sinn
Fein who was at the centre of the IRA's ceasefire).' Founded in the late
1960s, Eta has been responsible for more than 600 deaths in its campaign to
create an independent Basque state and some 500 of its members are in
Spanish and French prisons.
'We have still got to digest the Irish developments,' says Mr Idigoras, 'but
it is clear that they will force every-one, the Spanish government, the
Basque political parties and Eta to move their pawns.'
The sentiment is echoed by the PNV's Mr Jose Antonio Ardanza, who is certain
to be returned as Basque prime minister on Sunday.
Mr Ardanza has said during the electoral meetings that he favours 'discreet
and, if possible, secret' talks with Eta.
Mr Xabier Arzalluz, the powerful chairman of the PNV and its leading
ideologue for the past 20 years, says he expects a 'deep rethink' by HB
after Sunday's vote, particularly if the opinion polls are borne out and the
radicals, which are at present the third-largest political group in the
Basque Country after the PNV and the Socialists, lose votes.
Although there are important differences between the politics of Northern
Ireland and those of the Basque Country, Mr Arzalluz says HB's supporters
have been 'stunned by the IRA's decision to give up violence, apparently in
return for nothing'.
The momentum towards a Basque peace process will, however, depend on the
willingness of the Socialist government in Madrid to sanction the talks that
the PNV has in mind.
While the Madrid government officially opposes contacts with Eta, Mr Mario
Onaindia, a former Eta member and now a leading Socialist party official in
the Basque Country, says circumstances after the election will favour 'a
dialogue'.
Sunday's vote is, however, expected to see a decline in support for the
Socialist party which has been the junior partner in the Basque Country's
government for the past eight years. The shrinking Socialist vote is partly
prompted by the diminished popularity of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in
Madrid, but it could also reflect dissatisfaction among rank-and-file
socialists, mostly blue-collar migrant workers from elsewhere in Spain, over
the local party's decision to co-opt a minority left-wing group led by Mr
Onaindia and to compete for the 'ethnic' Basque vote.
Polls suggest that the IU coalition could be backed on Sunday by former
socialist supporters and, underlining a further shift from nationalist-based
politics, that the conservative PP will do well among young professionals.
'People are at last waking up,' says Mr Jaime Mayor Oreja, the leader of the
PP in the Basque Country.
'The permanent vindication of the Basque nation over the past years has only
created uncertainties and impoverished the Basque Country,' he says.

FT  21 OCT 94 / French growth may give poll boost to Balladur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France is set to enter its 1995 presidential election year with its economy
already expanding at the pace of 3.1 per cent forecast by the government for
the full year.
Insee, the official statistics agency, yesterday raised its growth forecast
for 1994 from 2.0 per cent to 2.2 per cent and said that by the end of 1994
it expected the economy to be expanding on a year-on-year basis at the rate
of 3.1 per cent.
The government has already predicated its 1995 budget on real growth of 3.1
per cent, but set this as the average for the whole year, rather than the
initial momentum with which the French economy would go into 1995.
The growth forecast of Insee, which also said that despite August's slight
increase in unemployment it expected to see a modest fall in joblessness
over 1994 as a whole, comes as welcome news for the prime minister, Mr
Edouard Balladur, in his as-yet-undeclared candidacy for the presidential
elections in May.
His advisers have recognised a certain risk that the necessity for fiscal
discipline to reduce the 1995 budget deficit, plus the recent rise in long
term interest rates, might choke off recovery in the French economy.
It grew by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter and by 1 per cent in the second
quarter. Insee now forecasts 1.4 per cent real growth in the second half of
this year, and it believes that French companies have enough cash in hand
not to deterred by the rise in long-term interest rates from pursuing their
investment plans.
Even if, as Insee expects, there is a 'technical slowdown' in French
industrial output after the first half's strong growth throughout Europe, it
will be limited and amply offset by strong consumer demand.
The agency comments that the main surprise has been the continuation of
strong car sales after various government incentives earlier this year
lapsed.
Overall, it forecasts household consumption rising 1.7 per cent in the
second half of this year, following the 0.5 per cent increase between
January and June.
Insee said that the contribution of foreign trade to French growth may soon
turn 'negative', as internal demand boosts imports faster than the growth in
exports. But the government, which yesterday announced a FFr7.2bn trade
surplus for August (up from FFr4.8bn in July), said it was still aiming for
a 1994 surplus of around FFr80bn.

The recovery of manufacturing industry in western Germany is picking up
speed and companies are now operating at 83.7 per cent capacity, up from 78
per cent a year ago, according to a report from the Ifo economics institute.
The quantity of orders in hand was returning to pre-recession levels even
though productivity had improved, the report said. For the first time
industry in eastern Germany was 'largely satisfied' with the business
environment. However, companies are still concerned about the low levels of
exports and about the amount of orders in hand which corresponded to 2.7
months work in the third quarter, down from 3.1 months in the quarter
before. Industry in eastern Germany was producing at 78 per cent of its
capacity, slightly more than in the second quarter and up from 72 per cent
in September 1993. Despite the improved figures, around 2 per cent of the
workforce are still likely to lose their jobs.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Swiss government is making progress towards reducing a budget deficit
that was driven up to 19 per cent of spending last year by soaring welfare
payments. Berne is projecting an 11 per cent reduction of this year's
deficit to SFr6.9bn (Pounds 3.45bn) and a further 6 per cent cut to SFr6.5bn
next year. With net debt service costs amounting to less than 5 per cent of
spending and total federal debt of SFr70bn at the end of last year
representing only 20 per cent of gross domestic product, the government is
not in difficulty. But double digit growth rates in interest charges in the
past two years have caused concern. Spending is set to increase only 4.9 per
cent this year to SFr42.6bn and to rise a negligible 0.8 per cent next year
after a 7.4 per cent jump in 1993, mainly because demand for welfare
payments is easing as the economy recovers. Revenues, which plunged 6 per
cent last year to SFr32.8bn, are expected to advance 8.6 per cent this year
and a further 2.1 per cent next year when a value added tax comes into
effect.

Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
flew into Budapest yesterday for talks with Hungary's new Socialist-led
government. The three-month-old government is drafting its 1995 budget and a
three-year economic reform plan which it hopes will form the basis of a
stand-by agreement with the IMF. The Fund is urging Hungary to make radical
reforms in welfare spending and in fiscal policy and to cut domestic
consumption in order to reduce its large budget and current account deficits
and prevent the country's Dollars 26bn foreign debt from rising further.
When it took office the government promised swift and tough measures to
tackle the country's poor economic situation. However, it has retroactively
raised pensions across the board by 8 per cent from January and deferred
increases in value added tax and energy prices, planned for this month,
until next year.

President Francois Mitterrand of France and Spain's prime minister, Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, met yesterday to discuss European unity and stability in
the Mediterranean. The talks between the two long-serving Socialist leaders
in the south-western French town of Foix are their last bilateral summit
before Mr Mitterrand steps down next May. The two opened the 4.8km-long
Puymorens mountain tunnel in the Pyrenees as a symbol of co-operation
between their two states. In interviews published to coincide with their
two-day talks, both men repeated their disagreement with a proposal floated
in Bonn to build the European Union on a 'hard core' group comprising
Germany, France and Benelux. Mr Mitterrand's spokesman said Paris was also
keen to co-ordinate with Madrid their forthcoming successive EU presidencies
to ensure smooth preparations for the 1996 intergovernmental conference to
reform Union institutions.
Another issue at the summit will be security and co-operation in the
Mediterranean, as both France and Spain fear they would take the brunt of
massive emigration if strife in Algeria continued to worsen.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Europe boosts its Security Council weight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany and Italy were elected to the UN Security Council last night, giving
Europe 40 per cent of the seats when they begin their two-year terms in
1995. Britain, France and Russia are permanent members and the Czech
Republic then will be in the second year of its term. Secret balloting was
conducted in the General Assembly following nominations by regional groups.
Indonesia, Botswana and Honduras also were elected.
The fact that the European Union's four principal states will be members for
the next two years can only add to a growing clamour by third world
countries for a radical restructuring of the council. Discussions that have
been going on for some time have made little progress, in part because of
disagreement about the size of an expanded council. While Germany and Japan
seem likely eventually to be admitted as permanent members, many delegates
say claims by big countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America must be
considered for a similar status.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Swedish current account gloom
</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden recorded a larger than expected deficit of SKr4.4bn (Pounds 379m) in
its current account in August because of a lower surplus in the balance of
services and higher overseas interest payments by the state and private
sectors. The Riksbank said the deficit pushed down the current account
surplus for the January-August period to SKr2.3bn. But the overall trend of
strong export growth this year means this surplus remains a significant
turnaround from a deficit in the same period last year of SKr11bn.
Industrial production, meanwhile, rose by 0.6 per cent in August compared
with July, bringing the increase in the year to the end of August to 8.4 per
cent and reflecting Sweden's slow recovery from recession over the past
year. The central statistics bureau also said industrial labour costs in
August stood at SKr146.70 per hour, or 5.4 per cent higher than at the same
stage last year.
EU annual inflation, as measured by consumer price indices, fell to 3 per
cent in September, the lowest level since March 1987, according to figures
from Eurostat. Inflation was 3.1 per cent in August and July after remaining
at 3.2 per cent from March to June. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece were
above the EU average.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Croatia peace plan takes shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE CLARK, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yasushi Akashi, the top UN official in former Yugoslavia, said yesterday
that a 'complex and ambitious' peace plan for Croatia would be completed
soon. His comment was the latest hint of intense diplomatic activity aimed
at resolving the future of Serb-occupied parts of Croatia, and thus paving
the way for normal relations between Belgrade and Zagreb. Croatia's
President Franjo Tudjman said last week that 'various initiatives in various
places' were in progress which would give journalists 'a lot to discuss'
once they were made public. Mr Peter Galbraith, US ambassador to Zagreb who
is one of the four members of an international mediation group on Croatia,
has suggested that Croatia could draw on the US, Canadian or Swiss models in
granting autonomy to Serb-dominated areas. About a third of Croatia's
territory is under de facto Serb control following the Serb-Croat war of
1991-92. Diplomats say that Serb politicians in the occupied areas of
Croatia - who claim to have established an independent state - have become
more flexible recently, apparently under pressure from Belgrade.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Storms break Russia's long political calm: Tension is
building across the nation as crisis piles upon crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fabric of Russia's political stability is unravelling. There has been no
hot summer nor, so far, a hot autumn. The crises in the country's political
life - the collapse of the MMM pyramid selling operation, the civil war in
the southern republic of Chechnya, the growing evidence of a flouting of
civil rights in the regions - have all been contained. Now, however, the
price for that long period of calm is being paid.
The latest crisis - the more than 20 per cent fall in the rouble last week -
is not proving easy to calm. President Boris Yeltsin reacted like the
regional party boss he once was, by firing those apparently responsible - Mr
Sergei Dubinin, finance minister, and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank
chairman.
He did not, while doing so, consult his prime minister, Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, who was then on holiday. And though both the replacements for
these officials are of a reformist bent, the damage done to the authority of
the government by this executive action has been immense.
In a remarkable article in yesterday's Moskovsky Novosti, Mr Sergei
Alexashenko, the young deputy finance minister responsible for the budget,
rips into the president for his action. He accuses him constantly trying to
sabotage the tough budget policy by telephoning the finance ministry to
demand payments 'to this director or that general'; of acting
unconstitutionally by not giving the prime minister the chance to choose the
new appointees; and of engineering an 'economic military coup' by appointing
an investigatory commission into the rouble's collapse composed almost
wholly of generals (defence minister, interior minister, heads of domestic
and foreign intelligence services, head of Border Guards).
The weakness of Mr Chernomyrdin's position was graphically illustrated by
the rumours that he had offered his resignation on Tuesday night. Both he
and Mr Yeltsin have denied it, and the latter took a cabinet meeting
yesterday to discuss the budget.
According to Mr Igor Bunin, head of a think tank with strong links to the
Yeltsin apparat, 'the president understood that he needed Chernomyrdin, that
he is his last defence'. However, according to Mr Vitaly Tretyakov, editor
of the daily Nezavimiaya Gazeta, his resignation is only a matter of time.
One of Mr Chernomyrdin's own ministers, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, deputy premier
for nationalities, admitted on Tuesday that the government had suffered 'a
heavy blow'.
The government's main task now is to propose a budget to the Duma (lower
house of parliament) of unprecedented severity aimed at bringing down
inflation to 1 per cent a month by the second half of next year and
refraining from any further borrowing from the central bank. Drawn up by
radical young deputy ministers within the finance and economic ministries,
and supported by Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy minister for the economy, and
by the prime minister himself, the budget also received initial assent from
the president's advisers.
Now, however, the gulf which has yawned between Mr Chernomyrdin and the
president may mean the latter will no longer lend it his necessary support;
and the Duma, fragmented as it is, may also revolt.
Crucial to the budget's success is backing from the International Monetary
Fund, whose senior officials are now in Moscow for negotiations on a
stand-by loan. The government is counting on at least Dollars 8bn in
stand-by and other credits to be agreed this year, and a further Dollars 6bn
to stabilise the rouble next year. It wants to calibrate repayments of its
Dollars 90bn foreign debt with IMF and World Bank assistance over the next
4-5 years, in an ambitious effort to restructure and stabilise its finances
over the medium term.
However, the IMF is in a sceptical mood. In rare public comments in Moscow
earlier this week, Mr John Odling-Smee, head of the department concerned
with Russia, said the government still needed to demonstrate that it could
put a cap on spending: 'Until then there is no hope of containing the
budgetary situation.' He warned that 'this is not the time to take the easy
line and to give way to pressure from industries. This is the moment to try
to get things under much better control'.
In remarks aimed at the government's hopes for loans, he said he was
concerned 'about the very large amount of financing expected from elsewhere.
I don't think all that money will be available, and I certainly don't think
it will be good for Russia'.
As the budgetary struggle intensifies, so the social situation becomes
bleaker. The unions, until now a dormant force, have threatened to strike
next Thursday - when the prime minister is due to present the budget to the
parliament - over the vast backlog of unpaid wages. Mr Oleg Soskovets, first
deputy prime minister, promised earlier this week to pay these wages but
that would blow another Rbs2,000bn hole in the budget if he did.
Yesterday in Moscow, a crowd some 5,000-strong heard demands for the
government's resignation from normally reformist journalists attending the
funeral of Mr Dmitry Kholodov, a young reporter on Moskovsky Komsomolets
killed on Monday a briefcase bomb. His death has been blamed on 'mafia
circles' in the military command, trying to protect secrets of corruption in
the forces Western Group which he was investigating.
These events, especially the crash in the currency, forced Mr Yeltsin to
postpone until December the meeting this week of the political parties and
groups which signed a joint agreement for national accord earlier this year.
The president has placed much importance on the agreement, seeing it as a
fundamental indicator of the desire of the main political participants to
resolve their differences peacefully.
National accord is now clearly impossible to proclaim - and will be hard to
do so in December. Inflation is rising - to over 10 per cent this month,
more in November. Unemployment is also increasing, as are the number of days
lost through strikes. Opposition, hitherto largely confined to the parties
in the parliament, may come out on the streets once more. Even the booming
stock prices, a real success story of the past year, have turned down,
though not by much so far. The situation may be saved, but it is very tense.

FT  21 OCT 94 / EU acts on Italian threat to union expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union finance ministers will today try to settle a long-running row
over Italian milk quotas, which threatens the planned expansion of the EU
and the ratification of a new Commission in January.
Ministers were forced to attend an emergency meeting after a call from the
German government, current EU president, which believes it can reach a deal
in Brussels. But a Commission official warned yesterday 'it is not sewn up'.
Italy refuses to ratify the increase in the EU budget ceiling agreed at the
December 1992 Edinburgh summit, unless it is let off a large part of the
mandatory fines imposed for exceeding its milk production quota under the
Common Agricultural Policy.
Spain, in reprisal, says it will not ratify the planned EU entry next
January of Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway unless the budget increase,
from which it will get nearly a doubling in EU regional aid funds, is
secured.
Failure to overcome the impasse might provoke a full-blown Euro-crisis,
which is why 'the Germans are at last putting some pressure on', a senior EU
official said.
This exercise in hostage-taking across ostensibly unrelated issues will make
it hard for the EU to agree next year's budget. But it is becoming clear
that the new Commission, appointed by member states, may not be able to take
office on January 7.
The European parliament, which under the Maastricht treaty has the right to
scrutinise and ratify the new Commission, wants to delay this process until
all commissioners are nominated and Euro-MPs from the new entrants are in
place. 'We want a parliament of 16 (member states) voting on a Commission of
16,' a senior parliament official said yesterday.
But any delay in enlargement could prolong a caretaker regime headed by the
current Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors. It could also lead to the
unravelling of the financial and agricultural deals which have been struck
with the newcomers, and inflame anti-EU sentiment in Sweden and Norway, due
to hold referendums on entry next month.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, abandoned plans to attend a gathering at
Dorneywood, his Buckinghamshire residence, to attend the Ecofin meeting.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Minister resigns amid new claims of Tory 'sleaze': Smith
admits breaking disclosure rules - Hamilton denies allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major's government was shaken yesterday by fresh allegations of
financial impropriety after the forced resignation of a government minister
over his past business relationship with Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods.
A second minister issued a fierce denial of newspaper allegations - repeated
in the House of Commons - that he had received cash for asking parliamentary
questions on behalf of Mr Fayed. His political position remained in doubt.
Amid chaotic scenes at Westminster, Mr Major stunned the Commons by
appearing to suggest under parliamentary privilege that the Harrods chief
sought some form of arrangement with the government. A spokesman for Mr
Fayed denied that he wanted a deal of any sort with the government.
In the latest of a series of personal and financial scandals that have
engulfed the government since the 1992 election, Mr Tim Smith, a junior
Northern Ireland minister, resigned after admitting he broke parliamentary
rules over disclosure of his business links with Harrods.
But Mr Neil Hamilton, who as corporate affairs minister is responsible for
business ethics, flatly denied any wrongdoing when he supported Mr Fayed
during the 1980s battle for control of Harrods with Mr Tiny Rowland of
Lonhro.
Mr Hamilton said he was suing The Guardian for libel for printing
allegations, repeated in the Commons, that he had been paid for his
assistance.
But several senior Tories continued to voice doubts over whether Mr Hamilton
should retain his post. They suggested that he should resign to save the
government political embarrassment.
Mr Ian Greer, chairman of the consultancy Ian Greer Associates, which acted
for Mr Fayed during the same period, also issued writs against The Guardian.
Mr Major, who said the allegations against the two ministers had been
brought to his attention three weeks ago, startled MPs by saying he had made
clear then that he would not come to any 'arrangement' with Mr Fayed. The
prime minister said the allegations had originated from, but had not been
passed directly by, Mr Fayed, and he had immediately asked Sir Robin Butler,
cabinet secretary, to investigate.
In what MPs took as indicating that the Harrod's chief had wanted some form
of deal, Mr Major added: 'I made it absolutely clear at that time that I was
not prepared to come to any arrangement with Mr Fayed.'
Downing Street officials, however, later sought to play down that
implication, suggesting Mr Major was attempting to demonstrate his
determination to act firmly and openly.
Mr Smith admitted he received funds for asking questions on behalf of Mr
Fayed during the long-running legal battle with Mr Tiny Rowland's Lonhro. In
his resignation letter, he said he had not declared all the necessary
information in the register of MPs' financial interests.
Ironically, Mr Smith first entered the government only nine months ago after
the enforced resignation of another junior minister, Mr Tim Yeo, over his
personal life.
Amid a renewed Labour onslaught against government 'sleaze', Mr Major made
clear that he had no hesitation in allowing Mr Smith to resign. In a letter
to the former minister, he said his actions while a backbench MP had been
'clearly wrong'.
To reinforce the point, Mr Major told the Commons: 'I am determined to
ensure high standards of probity right across government and I will not
tolerate anything less than the highest standards of behaviour.'
Referring to Mr Hamilton, the prime minister said the industry minister  -
who along with Mr Smith had been interviewed by Sir Robin and Mr Richard
Ryder, the chief whip - had denied all the allegations.
Mr Major said Mr Hamilton, also a backbench MP at the time of the alleged
payments, 'has written to me refuting the allegations that he was paid any
money either to ask questions or undertake any activity whatsoever'.
Downing Street subsequently said that a stay by Mr Hamilton at the Ritz, a
Paris hotel owned by Mr Fayed, had been looked at by the Commons committee
on members' interests. Tory party managers had been told by the committee
chairman it was taking no action. But senior Whitehall officials
acknowledged the committee had not produced a formal report. During his
investigation Sir Robin had instead been shown copies of correspondence
between Mr Hamilton and Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, committee chairman.
The prime minister faced calls from Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, for a
tightening of rules governing ministerial behaviour. Mr Major said the
Commons privileges committee could extend its investigation into two
backbench MPs alleged to have accepted cash for parliamentary questions. He
rejected Mr Blair's demand that the inquiry be public.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Electrical flaw stops Eurostar from shining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The passengers were waiting to board. The champagne was on ice. The driver
was in his cab. But nothing happened.
Two minutes before the Pounds 24m Eurostar train was to pull out of Waterloo
station yesterday morning, an electrical fault forced engineers to call off
the inaugural London-Paris run.
There was a one-hour delay while embarrassed Eurostar officials ordered a
replacement train from its north London depot, and hastily stocked it with
food and refreshments for the European press on the trip.
In spite of making the journey in a record time of 2 hours 49 minutes, the
event, designed to let the Eurostar show off its paces to the press, became
a public relations disaster, the latest in a long line of setbacks that have
dogged the Pounds 10bn cross-Channel rail project.
Eurostar, open to the public from November 14, is run by the railways of
Britain, France and Belgium.
News of the electrical fault helped to depress the shares of Eurotunnel, the
Channel tunnel operator, by 12p to a record low of 199p.
'This is all very embarrassing for us,' an official of European Passenger
Services, the British partner in Eurostar, said yesterday. 'Things had been
going well and we did not think it was necessary to put on a back-up train
(at Waterloo).'
EPS said its engineers had discovered a fault in a circuit breaker
controlling the power supply, which would have meant the train could not
have run at its top speed of 186mph in France.
Mr Malcolm Southgate, deputy managing director of EPS, commented: 'We
wouldn't have announced that we were going to start commercial passenger
services next month if we were not satisfied that the trains were okay.
Obviously there are lessons to be learnt.'
Tickets for Eurostar services go on sale on October 24.

FT  21 OCT 94 / Brazil moves to underpin currency and curb inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil has moved to curb foreign investment flows and limit consumer credit
as part of wide-ranging measures to underpin its new currency, the Real, and
head off inflation.
The measures include a one-off 1 per cent tax on foreign investment into the
stock market, and an increase in tax on Brazilian companies issuing bonds
overseas from 3 per cent to 7 per cent of the total. The tax paid by
foreigners on fixed interest investments in Brazil is to be raised from 5
per cent to 9 per cent.
The central bank also raised limits on the amount of dollars that could be
bought in the foreign exchange market.
Financial markets reacted calmly yesterday to the measures. A private sector
banker said the measures were welcome, even if they led to a short-term dip
in foreign investment. 'It is next year that the real investment will come,'
he said.
The Real was steady yesterday at 0.86 against the dollar, while Sao Paulo's
stock market slipped less than 1 per cent in moderate volume to close at
47,244.
The package follows the introduction of the new currency in July under an
anti-inflation plan drafted by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, then finance
minister, who went on to win the presidential election earlier this month.
The Real's introduction has cut monthly inflation from 50 per cent to less
than 2 per cent. However, the new currency has appreciated more than 15 per
cent against the dollar since July, partly because of inflows of foreign
capital attracted by Brazil's high interest rates and promising stock
market.
The inflow has put pressure on the exchange rate, leading to complaints from
exporters that it is making their goods uncompetitive.
Some of the measures, including changes in export credit arrangements and
the removal of limits on dollar purchases in the foreign exchange markets,
are designed to stop further appreciation of the Real.
Outgoing president, Mr Itamar Franco, denied the package had been held back
until after the elections to assist Mr Cardoso's chances, but said it would
help him keep the economy on track next year.
Mr Franco also denied the measures would lead to recession, as some consumer
groups claim. The package includes tighter rules on credit cards and shorter
repayment periods on some of Brazil's most popular forms of consumer credit.
Since the Real's launch, sales of consumer goods such as televisions and
cars have increased sharply, many financed by credit.
, a director of department store group Mappin, one of Brazil's largest, said
the measures would 'definitely affect demand'. although traffic in the
stores was normal yesterday morning.
The measures to tax foreign investment were also seen as a move towards an
interest rate rise. Without the new taxes, any rate rise would have
accelerated the flow of foreign investment into fixed rate securities,
adding to pressure on the exchange rate.
Brazilian bond issues on the Euromarkets is expected to decline, following
issuance this year of more than Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn). But investors
say the price of Brazil's existing dollar denominated bonds could rise.

FT  20 OCT 94 / (CORRECTED) Booker makes a catch in farmed Atlantic salmon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERICK ORAM, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 21st October 1994) appended to this article.
Booker, the British food group, will become the world's largest farmer of
Atlantic salmon with its Dollars 122.1m (Pounds 77m) agreed bid for Marine
Harvest International, a US company 27 per cent owned by Hanson, the UK
conglomerate.
The deal will more than quadruple Booker's salmon interests which will now
account for about one-tenth of group profits. Booker, with about 7 per cent
of world production, will leap ahead of Norsk Hydro and other Norwegian
producers with whom it is engaged in a recurring price war.
Booker's share of Scottish production will rise from about 9 per cent to
just under 25 per cent, Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive, said. The
consolidation was 'very good news for the Scottish industry which is under
attack from the Norwegians,' he added.
A counter-bid from Norway or Asia could not be ruled out but was unlikely,
he said. No other bidders had been flushed out by Marine Harvest's
announcement several weeks ago that it was discussing an offer at about
Dollars 10.50 a share. Booker is offering Dollars 10.20 for the shares.
Booker has 34 per cent of Marine's equity in the net, 27 per cent from
Hanson and less than 8 per cent from the family of Mr David Clarke, chief
executive of Hanson Industries, the conglomerate's US arm.
Most of the assets Booker is buying were in the salmon farming business
Unilever sold to Marine in October 1992. Hanson is retaining Marine's shrimp
business with a net asset value of Dollars 25.2m which it will sell or
liquidate. Booker will reimburse Hanson if its loss on the sale exceeds
Dollars 8.5m. Booker is paying for Marine from existing credit lines and the
placement of 10.5m new shares, equal to 4.9 per cent of its existing equity.
The shares were placed at 404p while Booker's shares closed down 7p at 413p.
Marine gives Booker production in Chile, considered the world's best and
cheapest fish farming location, and access to the US and Japanese markets.
Its present farming is in Scotland and aimed at Europe.
Marine's salmon operations reported operating profits of Dollars 19.9m on
turnover of Dollars 89.3m in the year to September 1993.
Mr Bowen said the purchase price was about 10 times Marine's net income from
salmon and that the deal would 'modestly enhance' Booker's earnings in the
first year.

Optimism at last, Page 39
CORRECTION
Hanson will reimburse Booker for losses over Dollars 8.5m on the sale of
Marine Harvest International's shrimp business, and not vice versa as
reported in yesterday's edition.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, plans to sell its acetics
business as part of a strategy to get out of making intermediate and basic
chemicals.
Rhone-Poulenc management has convened a meeting for October 27 at the works
council at the group's Pardies acetics plant in south-west France to explain
the move. An announcement will be made later that day.
Rhone-Poulenc gave no further details, except to confirm the impending sale
was in line with the intention of Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, president, to sell
Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn in assets over the next 18 months. These would be
chiefly in intermediate or basic chemicals for which his group had no
in-house use or where the scale of its activity was dwarfed by that of
others.
Acetics form part of Rhone-Poulenc's organic and inorganic intermediates
division, which last year recorded sales of FFr14.1bn (Dollars 266m). It is
estimated that acetics accounted for just over FFr2bn of this.
Other main producers of acetics are British Petroleum and Hoechst, but
according to one report in Paris, Union Carbide of the US might be
interested in buying the unit from Rhone-Poulenc.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CANCUN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Miguel Mancera, governor of Mexico's central bank, announced yesterday
that the country's foreign currency reserves had fallen to Dollars 17.2bn
(Pounds 10.8bn), Dollars 7.3bn less than at the end of last year.
The reduction since December follows central bank intervention to defend the
peso after the assassination of presidential candidate Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio and subsequent nervousness over the August presidential election.
Reserves were reported to have been as high as Dollars 28bn in early
February, indicating the extent of Bank of Mexico's support for the
currency.
Mr Mancera said at a bankers' conference in Cancun that intervention since
May had been sporadic and in small quantities and that reserves have been
relatively stable since then.
Mexico's foreign currency reserves are published only three times a year,
and are considered an important indicator of confidence in the currency.
Despite central bank intervention, the peso has lost nearly 10 per cent of
its value against the dollar this year and is now trading close to its lower
limit against the US currency.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is seeking an initiative by Japanese
carmakers in order to resolve the US-Japan trade dispute on vehicles. Mr
Kantor said Japan's car industry could help break a deadlock in stalled
bilateral trade talks by outlining a new multi-year programme to buy more
foreign-made car parts.
'I believe both (the US and Japanese) industries are perfectly capable of
working this out between themselves, if encouraged by both governments,' he
said. Mr Kantor said Washington will start a probe into Japan's car spare
parts market under Section 301 of US trade law soon, the financial daily
Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. Under the bilateral economic framework talks,
the two nations have not yet agreed on ways to open Japan's car and car
parts market. The US has demanded that a yardstick be created to measure
future results of market-opening steps, while Japan has opposed such a plan,
saying the government cannot control the flow of private sector trade.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Brussels ban on shipping lines 'cartel'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday blocked the Trans-Atlantic Agreement
(TAA), a shipping 'conference' which set cargo rates and capacity levels
across the north Atlantic, because it infringed European Union competition
rules.
The decision represents a victory for exporters who complained the agreement
had led to excessive charges for shipping container cargoes and a defeat for
the 15 large shipping lines which set up the agreement in 1992.
The ruling is, however, only the first stage in resolving this dispute
because the shipowners established a modified arrangement, known as the
Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (TACA), in July. Earlier this month they
made a further concession by offering to remove capacity constraints from
the TACA.
But shippers, companies which export goods across the Atlantic, said this
was simply a delaying tactic and threatened legal action against the
European Commission if it did not speedily issue a ruling on both
agreements. A second objection to the TAA/TACA - that they set rates for
containers on their land journey to the port, thereby increasing costs - is
still rejected by the shipowners.
A decision on the TACA is expected within the next few weeks. The British
Shippers' Council, representing exporters, said the commission's ruling
established an important principle which would have implications for similar
conference agreements covering trade with the Far East and Africa.
'This underlines the fact that European industry has been unnecessarily
damaged over the past two years,' said Mr Chris Welsh, head of the council.
Shipping rates rose by an average 50 per cent in 1993 and between 10 and 15
per cent this year, he added.
Shipowners involved in the TAA had been expecting the commission ruling but
hope that the TACA ruling will be in their favour. They were last night
still awaiting full details of the commission decision.
If the TACA is also rejected, however, there could be a return to lower
transatlantic shipping rates and a resumption of the losses which plagued
this route in the late 1980s.
The TAA/TACA groups 15 large shipping lines which account for 85 per cent of
sailings across the north Atlantic. It was introduced to stem considerable
losses by the shipping lines and its members include Nedlloyd, Maersk, P&amp;O,
AP Moeller and Hapag-Lloyd. Exporters say these losses were exaggerated and
the conference has been used to push through excessive rate increases.

The association, better known as Fannie Mae, is the largest supplier of
funds for American home mortgages and one of the world's biggest issuers of
long-term debt. It has borrowed Dollars 100bn since the end of 1992, and is
seeking to fund expansion of its Dollars 214bn portfolio of mortgages.
The company made its debut in global bond markets four months ago when it
issued Dollars 1.5bn of ten-year global debentures, 60 per cent of which
were bought up by international investors. Lehman Brothers, the US
investment bank, is arranging the new facility, with ten other international
banks involved in the the issue.
Fannie Mae is a shareholder-owned company chartered by the US Congress.
Funding programmes approaching this scale are normally the province of
sovereign or supra-national borrowers, such as the World Bank.
Mr James Johnson, Fannie Mae chairman, said the programme would tap
'important new markets abroad'. Fannie Mae did not detail the amounts or
currencies of the maturities it plans to issue. But it clearly expects to
reduce its borrowing costs.
Funds obtained under the global bond issued in the summer were obtained for
five basis points less than would have been the case in the US market, said
Ms Linda Knight, Fannie Mae senior vice-president and treasurer. A basis
point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
The programme will give Fannie Mae access to international clearing systems
to allow it to trade and settle securities in its own time zone.
Fannie Mae has a triple A rating from credit rating agencies. Since 1988 it
has built up a domestic market in so-called 'callable' bonds - which can be
redeemed before maturity.
Another US mortgage provider, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,
known as Freddie Mac, launched its own Dollars 1.5bn global issue in July.

Sysco, the biggest US distributor of food to restaurants, hotels, schools
and other places where people eat away from home, reported a 21 per cent
increase in net profits to Dollars 58.4m in its first quarter, writes
Richard Tomkins.
The comparison was flattered by an extra tax charge of Dollars 4.9m in the
comparable quarter which reduced net profits to Dollars 48.1m. But Sysco
said the pre-tax figure was more than 10 per cent ahead even after incurring
start-up costs on significant new business.
In the latest quarter, sales increased by 10 per cent to Dollars 2.98bn. Mr
John Woodhouse, chairman, said that real volumes, after adjusting for food
price inflation of 1.8 per cent, were up 8.3 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, reported a 27 per
cent increase in revenues for its first fiscal quarter, with net earnings up
32 per cent.
Driven by strong demand for its Windows personal computer operating system
software and office applications programs, Microsoft continues to outpace
all of its competitors in the PC software market.
Revenues rose to Dollars 1.25bn from Dollars 983m in the first quarter of
1993. Net income increased to Dollars 316m from Dollars 239m, while earnings
per share were 51 cents against 39 cents in the first quarter of fiscal
1993. Per-share earnings were restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split
in May 1994.
'This was another solid quarter for the company,' said Mr Mike Brown,
Microsoft chief financial officer. 'These results reflect the ongoing
success of Windows as well as the continuing growth of our desktop
applications revenues led by Microsoft Office.'
North American sales represented 34 per cent of revenues, up from 33 per
cent, while European sales declined as a percentage of total revenues to 23
per cent from 28 per cent in the same period last year, reflecting slower
growth in the European PC market.
Sales of applications programs represented 60 per cent of worldwide
revenues.
Earnings were at the high end of Wall Street estimates. Analysts said that
Microsoft, which already dominates the markets for PC operating systems and
office applications, is now also moving ahead of competitors in the PC
database and word processing sectors, where it is winning market share from
Borland and WordPerfect. Microsoft also introduced several new programs for
home computer users during the first quarter as the company significantly
expanded its consumer marketing efforts.
Last week, Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Intuit, a leading
publisher of personal finance, tax preparation and small business accounting
software, for about Dollars 1.5bn in stock. The acquisition will give
Microsoft entry to the emerging market for on-line financial services such
as electronic bill paying.

<TEXT>
Lin Broadcasting, the US cellular telephone company, yesterday reported a 13
per cent increase in third-quarter operating income to Dollars 109.1m on net
revenues of Dollars 238.3m, which were 22 per cent higher than a year ago.
The improvement in operating income helped Lin report consolidated net
income for the quarter of Dollars 37.9m, compared with a loss in the
corresponding period of 1993 of Dollars 26.5m.
Lin is 52 per cent-owned by McCaw Cellular, the industry leader acquired
earlier this year by the long-distance telecommunications group AT&amp;T.
The turnround in profitability at Lin was partly accredited to continued
growth in its core cellular business - subscribers were up 200,000 at
974,000 from a year earlier.
Revenues from Lin's television station business, which the company plans to
spin off to shareholders later this year, rose 7 per cent during the quarter
to Dollars 42.3m.

Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare group that has recently agreed to buy
Eastman Kodak's diagnostic products division and the Neutrogena skin care
company, saw a 16 per cent increase in net profits in the third quarter in
spite of a big rise in its tax charge.
Growth was led by the pharmaceuticals division, which lifted sales by 21 per
cent because of strong performances from new drugs. The division had sales
of Dollars 1.3bn.
Overall, group sales rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 4.04bn, of which 2
percentage points were attributable to the recent weakness of the dollar
against other currencies.
International sales advanced by 22 per cent - much faster than domestic
sales, which rose by 9 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose by 22.5 per cent, but after the increase in the tax
charge, earnings per share were 17 per cent ahead at 82 cents.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Solid advances at GM
subsidiaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Revenues at EDS, the computer services subsidiary of General Motors, climbed
23 per cent in the latest quarter from a year ago, to Dollars 2.56bn.
Mr Les Alberthal, chairman and chief executive, attributed the advance in
sales to strong growth in Europe and Asia, adding that the value of new
business won in the first nine months of this year, at Dollars 7.4bn, was
already ahead of the figure for the whole of 1993.
The growth in sales supported a 13 per cent increase in after-tax profits
during the third quarter, to Dollars 216.4m. EDS's profits are used to
calculate the earnings of General Motors Class E shares, which were up 5
cents at 45 cents.
Meanwhile, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the carmaker's financial
services arm, reported after-tax profits of Dollars 245m, up from Dollars
205m a year ago.
The company attributed the advance largely to lower funding costs, which
resulted from both a better funding mix than a year ago and greater
confidence among investors in the outlook for GMAC and its parent.
The financing company also benefited from higher vehicle sales and the
growing popularity of leasing. The number of vehicles leased worldwide more
than doubled compared with a year ago, to 168,000, GMAC said.
Last year, GMAC, EDS and GM Hughes Electronics contributed Dollars 2.6bn
between them to GM's profits, while the group as a whole reported total net
income of Dollars 2.5bn. GM reports third-quarter earnings today.

<TEXT>
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French construction and utilities group,
raised net profit by 27 per cent in the first half of 1994 and predicted a
'significant' increase for the full year, agencies report from Paris.
Net group profit in the first half was FFr434m (Dollars 82.04m) up from
FFr342m in the first half of 1993. Operating profit rose to FFr1.53bn from
FFr1.20bn, on consolidated revenues up 7 per cent at FFr48.33bn, from
FFr45.11bn.
Profit before exceptional items rose to FFr1.09bn, from FFr743m while cash
flow advanced to FFr3.11bn, from FFr2.64bn.
Construction activities swung to a profit of FFr1m from a loss of FFr139m.
Lyonnaise-Dumez said the turnround came in spite of continued difficulty in
the sector.
Cash flow rose 20 per cent from the previous year.
Profits from services and the parent company's activities fell to FFr616m
from FFr768m, which the company said mainly reflected lower capital gains
during the period.
However, it said operating earnings rose 32 per cent.
Results from other activities, including property, showed a loss of FFr183m,
compared with a loss of FFr287m.
Property losses alone narrowed to FFr186m from FFr330m.
Lyonnaise des Eaux said it expected its full-year 1994 net attributable
profit to improve on the FFr804m posted in 1993.
'The group's recovery is continuing and the net attributable profit for the
full year 1994 should again improve significantly,' Lyonnaise des Eaux said.
Paribas, the French bank, is to pay Italcementi FFr325m to settle a dispute
about its sale of control of Ciments Francais to the Italian group.
In return, Italcementi said it was renouncing all pre-emption rights on
Paribas's stake in Ciments Francais.

Third-quarter figures from four leading US defence groups showed showed
generally higher margins on static or falling sales. Two of the companies,
McDonnell Douglas and Northrop Grumman, also reported higher military
aircraft sales and a sharp decline in missiles.
GM Hughes Electronics, the separately-quoted defence and electronics
subsidiary of General Motors, said its defence profits at the operating
level were up 31 per cent at Dollars 168m on sales down 8 per cent at
Dollars 1.36bn.
It attributed the fall in sales to reduced production on various programmes,
including ground radar and Trident missile components, plus termination of
the Advanced Cruise Missile programme and the Follow-On Early Warning
System.
Operating margins rose from 8.8 per cent to 12.4 per cent as a result of
cost reductions, Hughes said.
For the group as a whole, earnings were also helped by a 37 per cent rise in
auto electronics profits and a 110 per cent profits rise in the
telecommunications and space division, offset by a Dollars 52m loss caused
mainly by technical problems with the Hughes-Avicom in-flight entertainment
system. Net earnings were 61 cents a share against 56 cents.
McDonnell Douglas said underlying earnings were up 39 per cent at a record
Dollars 140m, on sales up only 1 per cent. Operating profit on military
aircraft was also a record at Dollars 182m, up 27 per cent on sales up 8 per
cent.
Sales growth was due to the F/A-18 and C-17 military aircraft programmes,
the company said. Profits on commercial aircraft, however, were down 27 per
cent at Dollars 8m.
Profits in the missiles, space and electronic systems division were down 51
per cent on a comparable basis at Dollars 56m, on sales down 34 per cent.
Northrop Grumman said sales for the quarter were up 58 per cent to Dollars
1.93bn, or down 6 per cent excluding acquisitions.
Operating profits from aircraft were up 44 per cent at Dollars 121m, while
profits in electronics and systems integration were up 167 per cent at
Dollars 40m.
Losses in missiles deepened to Dollars 20m from Dollars 11m, largely due to
increased development costs on the TSSAM missile.
Net income for the group was up 50 per cent at Dollars 39m.
General Dynamics, the nuclear submarine and armoured vehicle maker, reported
a 4 per cent underlying rise in net earnings, to Dollars 54m. Sales were
down 8 per cent to Dollars 714m, and operating margins rose from 8.2 per
cent to 10.8 per cent.

<TEXT>
Pfizer and Schering-Plough, two of the fastest-growing drugs groups in the
US, shook off the pressure on pricing in their home market with strong
volume gains during the third quarter.
Bristol-Myers Squibb, meanwhile, reported a year-on-year sales increase of
only 2 per cent. It also warned that it may take an additional 'material'
charge against earnings to cover the cost of settling product liability
claims relating to breast implants it manufacturered.
Schering-Plough reported a 19 per cent jump in US prescription drug sales
compared with a year before, driven by Claritin, an antihistamine, which
achieved sales of Dollars 85m, and Proventil, an asthma therapy. Pfizer's US
sales were up 15 per cent.
However, the two companies' experience overseas differed markedly.
Schering-Plough's non-US sales rose 1 per cent, but would have fallen 2 per
cent had it not been for foreign exchange differences.
Pfizer said its overseas sales grew 14 per cent. Its fastest growing product
overall was Norvasc, a cardiovascular drug, whose sales jumped 94 per cent
to Dollars 210m.
Pfizer reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 336.5m, or Dollars 1.09
a share, on sales up 11 per cent overall at Dollars 2.1bn. This represented
an 8 per cent increase on net earnings of a year ago, before one-off
charges.
Shering-Plough's net income rose 12 per cent, to Dollars 224m, on sales up 6
per cent at Dollars 1.1bn. Earnings per share in the latest period were
Dollars 1.17.
Bristol-Myers Squibb's net income rose 2 per cent to Dollars 621m, on sales
up 2 per cent at Dollars 2.9bn, while earnings per share were Dollars 1.22.
Pre-tax profits in the period were 6 per cent higher, but the after-tax
result was held back by a higher tax charge resulting from the phasing out
of US tax relief for Puerto Rico manufacturing operations.

FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: CU switch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial Union came under fire in a generally soggy composite insurance
arena as Credit Lyonnais Laing highlighted the impact on CU's balance sheet
of the Group Victoire acquisition and recommended a straight sell of CU
shares or a switch into Royal Insurance or Guardian.
CLL's insurance team described the acquisition as 'well timed from a pure
insurance viewpoint', but questioned the long term strategy of purchasing a
company which relies on third party distribution when technological
developments suggest more business will eventually go direct.
The broker estimated that CU's net asset value had been diluted to a current
level of 450p and anticipated initial earnings dilution of 10 to 15 per
cent.
CU shares declined 9 to 535p on turnover of 2.2m, while Royal was only 2 off
at 282p on 2.3m traded and Guardian a penny easier at 192p.
Barclays outshone other leading banks, moving up 3 to 567p in response to
positive noises from Hoare Govett, which was said to have lunched with
senior officials from Barclays on Tuesday and reiterated its positive stance
on the stock.
Lloyds Bank, on the other hand, continued to suffer from Tuesday's news that
Sir David Walker, the deputy chairman, is leaving the bank to join Morgan
Stanley, the US investment bank. Lloyds dipped 10 more to 554p.
Lloyds also played a part in the decline of Standard Chartered shares, which
lost 6 at 269p on relatively high volume of 3.8m as dealers picked up
whispers that Lloyds may at last be ready to dispose of its 4.7 per cent
stake in Standard, some 45m shares. Lloyds acquired its holding in Standard
in the early 1980s when it unsuccessfully bid for the bank.
Two big individual trades, one of 1.4m shares at 352p and another of 800,000
at the same price, said to have been executed by Swiss Bank Corporation,
were the catalyst for the strong upward move by Scottish Power, which
settled 5 higher at 353p. Turnover in Power reached a hefty 4.8m.
BTR was hit by a sell note squall, sliding to 305p at one stage before
closing 2 off at 309p in 12m turnover. Credit Lyonnais Laing, unhappy with
the pressure on the company's profits margins and concerned about earnings
dilution through impending warrant conversions, is telling clients to sell.
Smiths Industries put on 7 at 447p following strong results, although it was
the 13p dividend - against market hopes for 12.5p - that provided most of
the underpinning for the shares.
British Steel, the most heavily traded Footsie stock with 16m shares
changing hands, eased 3 1/2 to 159p as doubts about the shares' ability to
outperform the market continued to trigger substantial position taking. The
high turnover was mirrored by very active options business.
Senior Engineering continued to rally, moving up 4 to 82p on the back of
attempts by the company to reassure City institutions that this year's
forecast profits upset is largely an isolated affair.
NatWest Securities' latest property note was something of a mixed blessing
for the sector yesterday, with British Land receding 5 to 398p and Brixton
Estates 4 to 195p. The securities house expects share price discounts to
asset values to widen by a third to 20 per cent on average over the next 12
months and has moved its stance to neutral.
But the house was not uniformly downbeat. Its advice to switch from Brixton
Estates to Slough Estates helped to push the latter up 3 to 227p in turnover
of 2.4m. Equally, an upgrade of Hammerson's net asset value to 396p
following the company's big Australian disposal spurred the shares up 2 to
337p.
Price softness at Grand Metropolitan stood out in an otherwise resilient
drinks sector - Guinness put on 2 at 463p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle added 4
at 508p - with the weakness of the dollar helping to push the shares down 5
to 416p. More than half of GrandMet's turnover arises in the US.
Paper group Bowater fell 12 to 452p after dealers said SG Warburg removed
the stock from its buy list. The house shaved profits forecasts but remained
positive over long term prospects.
Publisher Harrington Kilbride dropped 10 to 42p after announcing a
first-half loss and passing its interim dividend.
Shop fitter Havelock Europa jumped 18 to 188p as it restored the interim
dividend for the first time in three years.
Bullish comments from David Sainsbury, chairman of Britain's biggest
supermarket group, propped up the food retailers yesterday. Argyll gained 2
at 269p and J. Sainsbury a penny at 399p, while Asda and Tesco were steady.

FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: GEC active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Turnover of 13m shares in GEC kept attention firmly fixed on the VSEL
takeover saga, where the cash-laden electronics giant is a declared
potential counter-bidder to the agreed offer made by British Aerospace for
the submarines group.
But most of the activity in GEC turned out to be tax rather than bid
related, and the shares dipped 3 to 284p. A bed and breakfast deal involving
11.3m shares passed through the market at 278p. VSEL itself moved down 15 to
1300p while BAe lost 6 to 478p.

FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend hopes lift waters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The utilities areas of the market, always viewed as safe havens when the
wider market comes under pressure, gave a strong performance yesterday, led
by the water stocks.
These were driven sharply higher, helped by general optimism over the
forthcoming interim reporting season that commences on November 1 with
results from Thames Water, which vies with North West as the sector leader.
Dealers said the surge by the water issues was largely triggered by Smith
New Court, whose analyst was said to have highlighted the potential for good
increases in interim payments.
Most analysts are looking for interim dividend rises in the region of 7 to
11 per cent for the individual companies. Specialists also pointed out that
the government's golden share in all 10 water companies will be abolished on
December 31, opening the way for takeover moves.
The best individual performance came from Welsh Water, up 13 at 657p, while
Anglian, 549p, Northumbrian, 687p, and Wessex, 631p, were all 12 ahead.

FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Attempted rally reversed by bond
weakness - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Uncertainty about the US dollar continued to gnaw away at confidence in a
sluggish UK equity market yesterday. Further losses in government bonds,
following confirm-ation that domestic retail sales had strengthened in
September, also bore down on share prices, and the FT-SE 100 Index lost a
further 24.5 points to close at 3,060.8.
Early trading saw a brave attempt at a rally, largely inspired by a brief
uptick in stock index futures. The Footsie climbed to just above 3,092, but
the flurry was quickly over and it was clear that there was no support for a
challenge to the 3,100 area.
The 0.5 per cent gain in UK retail sales last month was in line with some
forecasts hurriedly reshaped by City analysts in the wake of Tuesday's
survey from the members of the Confederation of British Industry. Members of
the CBI reported that retail sales were growing at the fastest rate for
nearly a year.
On balance, equity market analysts did not see the retail sales growth as
being a threat for an early rise in base rates, but retail and consumer
issues showed little enthusiasm for the indication that retail sales may at
last be responding to economic recovery.
The market was restrained by the weakness in bonds, especially in Germany,
and also by the lack of vitality in the US dollar even before the
announcement of the US trade deficit for August. Disclosure that the US
trade deficit with Japan had risen to the highest level for a year sparked
further weakness in the US currency, and the blue chip dollar-earning shares
in London were quick to react.
There were sharp falls among the pharmaceuticals stocks, which had already
been unsettled on Tuesday by SmithKline Beecham's admission that sales of
its Tagamet drug had been badly hit by expiry of the US patent. Other shares
regarded as closely linked to the dollar's fortunes, including RTZ and HSBC,
also turned lower.
But the picture was little better among the domestically orientated issues.
Most of the high street retailers continued to move lower, on the paucity of
buying support rather than on any increased selling pressure.
These stocks are now close to the pre-Christmas period which generates the
bulk of their annual profits, and confidence in near term prospects remains
muted in spite of yesterday's evidence that retail sales may be picking up.
Once again, the focus was on the big name stocks and the second liners were
somewhat overlooked. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index retreated 11.1 to 3,521.2.
Non-Footsie business made up about 60 per cent of the day's total equity
turnover.
Seaq-reported volume moved higher again, from 527.8m shares on Tuesday to
596m yesterday, but was still on the disappointing side of average levels.
Traders continued to stress the sluggishness of the market that is believed
to be making commercial life difficult for the pure brokerage houses, which
depend on retail, or customer, business for their living.
The London market is likely to turn its attention to domestic matters for
the rest of the week. This morning brings the latest statistics on domestic
money supply and on building society lending, to be followed on Friday by
provisional gross domestic product numbers for the third quarter of the
year.
However, the stock market will continue to watch the US dollar closely, with
the blue chip issues unlikely to respond to purely domestic factors at
present. But many analysts continue to predict an upswing in equities before
the end of the year as recovery in the domestic economy shows through in
terms of corporate profits and dividends, while subdued inflationary
pressures prompt a rally in global bond markets.

FT  20 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFFREY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures continued to decline, with premiums to the cash market
narrowing through most of the session, writes Jeffrey Brown.
The FT-SE 100 December contract was 3,070 at the official 4.10pm close, down
40 points for a two-day decline of 70. The cash market premium at this level
was 13 points, broadly in line with fair value premium.
Although the premium to cash equities was slim, narrowing to around 8 points
at times, traders said there was very little downward pressure on the cash
market.
The quality business remained poor, with little liquidity to be found in
either the morning or afternoon session. Traders said it was hard to deal in
sizes of more than 15 to 20 contracts.
Institutional investors, after their brief reappearance on Tuesday, stayed
on the sidelines. The atmosphere was gloomy, and most traders thought the
contract would go lower before it recovered.
Activity was again dull, with contract numbers easing to 12,822, from 13,429
in the previous session.
Stock options turnover totalled 39,813 lots, against 26,685 on Tuesday.
FT-SE and Euro FT-SE business accounted for 28,500 lots.
Guinness was far and away the most active individual option, trading 2,060
lots. Glaxo, HSBC and British Steel were also busy options.

Equities retreated to close 3.1 per cent down in light trade on the Sao
Paulo bourse as investors sold on concern about probable government
restrictions on foreign funds into the country and a possible higher minimum
wage. The Bovespa index fell 1,509 to 47,587.
Brazil's real declined sharply against the dollar in the commercial foreign
exchange yesterday as players rushed to the US currency after the news of
possible restrictions. The real closed 1.3 per cent down at RDollars 0.858
to the dollar after the central bank sold dollars in the market to help the
local unit.
The approval yesterday by a Lower House committee of a proposal to increase
Brazil's minimum wage to RDollars 100 from RDollars 70 as of December also
weighed on prices.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow in sharp climb on
earnings reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks climbed sharply yesterday afternoon as more strong earnings news
overshadowed fresh weakness in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New
York.
After showing a modest decline during the morning, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average finished 18.50 ahead at 3,936.04. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained
2.62 at 470.28. On the NYSE, advances held a slim lead over declines. Volume
was a fairly heavy 319.3m shares as program-guided trading helped to lift
the level of activity. The Nasdaq composite strengthened 5.81 to 770.62 and
the American SE composite was up 1.54 at 458.26.
Early on, the market's attention was focused on August trade data released
by the Commerce Department and its effect on the bond and currency markets.
The report produced no big surprises. The US deficit in goods and services
came in at Dollars 9.7bn, just about as economists had forecast. The figure
represented a narrowing of the previous month's gap, revised up to Dollars
11.19bn.
But a jump in Japanese imports was a disappointment. With the US trade
deficit with Japan at Dollars 5.8bn, against Dollars 5.26bn a year earlier,
the dollar lost a little more ground against the yen. The decline in turn
reinforced a sour mood in the Treasury market, where a weaker greenback
often diminishes the appeal of bonds.
Against this backdrop, most stocks failed to make much progress during the
morning. Just before 1pm, however, a broad range of issues began to rally,
stirred by the fresh batch of encouraging quarterly results on offer.
Technology stocks were especially strong. One of the big winners was Digital
Equipment, up Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 31 5/8 . It narrowed its fiscal
first-quarter loss to 98 cents a share, from Dollars 1.14 a year earlier.
The figure was better than a Dollars 1.32 deficit forecast by analysts.
Compaq Computer was Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at Dollars 36 5/8 on heavy volume of
7.7m shares. The stock improved even though the company's third-quarter
earnings were spot on expectations and its gross margins receded.
IBM rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 75 3/8 in anticipation of its earnings,
due out later in the week.
In pharmaceuticals, Johnson &amp; Johnson climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54
3/4 on news that it had beaten the consensus estimate by posting
third-quarter profits of 82 cents a share.
McDonnell-Douglas, the aerospace concern, moved ahead Dollars 4 1/8 to
Dollars 127 1/4 after posting earnings per share of Dollars 4.07, about 17
per cent better than predicted. Its main US rival, Boeing, appreciated
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 44.
A host of telecommunications companies released their results, but none of
their stocks moved very much as a result. Bell Atlantic was up Dollars  3/4
at Dollars 52 1/8, Pacific Telesis added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 31 and MCI
was marked down Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 24 3/8 in Nasdaq trading.
In financial services, North American Mortgage plummeted Dollars 6 1/2 to
Dollars 19 1/2 . Mabon Securities lowered its rating on the stock after the
company revealed a loss of 27 cents a share, against net income of 83 cents
a year ago.
Elsewhere on the Nasdaq, Amgen led technology stocks in a solid advance. The
biotechnology concern jumped Dollars 4 to Dollars 58 on its forecast of
double-digit growth in sales and income next year.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt modifies its sector
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar, the main depressant for bourses this week, traded below DM1.50
again, early in New York. The mood on the Continent was not improved by
ambiguities perceived in the US August trade figures, and their effect on
bond markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT rotated its sector strategy by half a notch, and engineers took
more punishment as the Dax index, 33.60 lower at 2,051.16 on the session,
ended 11.45 down at an Ibis-indicated 2,058.13 after steadying in the
post-bourse.
MAN, which builds trucks as part of its range, dropped DM9 to DM405;
Mannesmann, which brings in steel and mobile telephone prospects, fell
another DM11 to DM378; and Linde, a leader in lift trucks, shed DM20 to
DM858.
All three, reflecting the switch to cyclicals, had been above-average
performers as blue chips fell by 11.2 per cent in the first nine months of
this year. But brokers said that the lower dollar would affect export
margins, and that there was a large sell order in Mannesmann.
Turnover rose from DM6.3bn to DM6.6bn. Among second-liners the window frame
manufacturer Weru plummeted by DM225 or nearly 20 per cent to DM905: Bank
Julius Bar and Barclays de Zoete Wedd cut their earnings forecasts after
Weru scaled down its sales growth expectations and said that 1994 profits
would not match those of the previous year.
PARIS fell back during the afternoon under pressure from futures, and the
CAC-40 index, having seen a high of 1,901, ended off 22.29 or 1.2 per cent
at 1,876.31.
There was plenty of corporate news to interest investors.
Bouygues, the construction group, lost a further 3 per cent to FFr532
following a 4 per cent fall on Tuesday, after making a forecast of virtually
unchanged 1994 sales figures and announcing an 18 per cent rise in
first-half net profits.
The company also suffered from selling after it said that it would not sign
a pledge by members of the country's building industry against using illegal
payments to win contracts or orders. A spokesperson for Bouygues said that
it had not signed the ethics declaration since there were already laws
governing business practice.
Elf Aquitaine dipped FFr9 to FFr367 amid reports that it would make a loss
on the sale of its US fertilisers division.
Thomson-CSF shed FFr4.40 to FFr144.00 after detailing a fall in first-half
net profits to FFr31m, from FFr455m last year. Analysts said the figures
were in line with expectations.
ZURICH was depressed by the weak dollar and losses in UBS and Roche
certificates, the SMI index declining 12.7 to 2,529.8 in what was also seen
as a continuing consolidation after last week's rally.
Roche certificates fell SFr30 to SFr5,650, extending the week's losses,
which followed downgraded earnings forecasts from a number of analysts after
Monday's nine-month sales figures. However, James Capel, which did not alter
its forecasts, commented that while sales growth was slowing, Roche had
plenty of scope to reduce costs, most notably in pharma research and
development, and this was increasingly being emphasised as a component of
profits growth.
UBS bearers declined SFr19 to SFr1,256 and the registered shares were SFr2
lower at SFr306. Comments by the board chairman that UBS would not abandon
its plan to create a single bearer class, even if the motion were defeated
at the November 22 egm, prompted concerns about a long legal battle ahead
with BK Vision, which retreated SFr30 to SFr1,405.
Among dollar earners, Nestle fell to a low of SFr1,167 before erasing some
of the loss to finish SFr5 easier at SFr1,179.
MILAN continued lower, with investors still waiting for the political
situation to become clearer, and for confirmation that the 1995 budget would
be passed, largely intact.
The Comit index shed 5.06 to 621.60, a level last seen in late January, and
23.9 per cent below April's peak during the euphoria which followed Mr
Silvio Berlusconi's general election success.
Blue chips were broadly lower, Fiat dipping L149 to L6,051, Olivetti L45 to
L1,813 and Telecom Italia L87 to L3,985. Pirelli contained its loss to L6 at
L2,210 after its sharp falls of the previous two sessions: Seaq
International in London said yesterday that Monday's exceptionally large
volume of 57m shares was the result of technical trading involving
repurchase transactions. Against the trend, Gaic continued to rise, adding
L30 at L801 following Monday's comments by Ferruzzi's chairman about the
future treatment of its Gaic stake. Ferruzzi gave up L33 at L1,270.
AMSTERDAM was broadly neutral ahead of tomorrow's options expiry, and the
AEX index finished 1.49 off at 404.01.
Weakness in bonds followed through into the financial sector during the
afternoon, with ING, for example, down Fl 1.00 at Fl 78.00.
MADRID produced an intraday bounce of about 1 1/2 per cent from its day's
lows, the general index closing only 0.16 down at 296.53 after early falls
on debt market weakness.
ISTANBUL, beset by inflation and a severe underperformer in dollar terms
this year, saw its domestic index drop 924.27 or 3.6 per cent to 24,894.23
as liquid funds stayed away from the equity market.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Markets in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The listing this week in New York and locally of Indosat, the Indonesian
telecommunications company, has given a boost to the Jakarta market, which
has been languishing so far this year a long way behind its regional
competitors.
The global offering of shares in the group, the largest in Asia, raised
about Dollars 1bn. Brokers say this should provide a much needed stimulus to
the equity market and encourage the return of foreign investors. Yesterday
Indosat made a successful debut on the local exchange, initially gaining
nearly 30 per cent on its IPO price of Rp7,000 before falling back on
profit-taking to close at Rp8,475.
One difficulty facing the market's forward progress remains the limit on the
foreign ownership of companies, currently at 49 per cent, which is not, at
least in the short term, to be lifted.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds overcome early losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold shares overcame early losses as bullion pushed higher, while
industrials extended gains in steady trade in further response to recent
good company results.
Golds, which started weaker on bullion price weakness and firm financial and
commercial rands, retraced losses by the close as the financial rand slipped
and the gold price recovered to Dollars 391 an ounce.
The overall index rose 9 to 5,691 and industrials added 37 at 6,505, while
golds finished 3 firmer at 2,325 after an early fall to 2,291.
De Beers was 50 cents down at R99.50 and Anglos unchanged at R238, while
Minorco slipped 50 cents to R106.25. All were off intraday lows.
Investec eased after a strong results-inspired advance on Tuesday,
retreating R1 to R64.

FT  20 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei weakens on
currency considerations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Worries about the yen's continued strength depressed activity, and share
prices were hit by arbitrage selling and small-lot, corporate profit-taking,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei 225 average ended 123.53 down at 19,868.87, after a morning high
of 20,023.40, and a low of 19,863.27 in the last half-hour of trading as
dealers adjusted positions and corporate investors took profits.
Most domestic investors remained inactive due to currency fluctuations,
while foreigners, who had been buying commodity and basic material related
stocks, also held the sidelines. Volume totalled 230m shares, against 255m.
The Topix index of all first section stocks receded 6.18 to 1,580.47 and the
Nikkei 300 dipped 1.15 to 288.94. Losers led gainers by 677 to 297, with 194
issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 3.19 to 1,292.71.
The yen fluctuated around the Y97 level against the dollar, in spite of
heavy buying of the latter by the Bank of Japan. However, some analysts
think the yen will ease following the US elections in November. Credit
Suisse Japan expects the dollar to rise after a rate increase by the US
Federal Reserve, and expects dollar selling by Japanese exporters to ease in
the near term.
Export-oriented high-technology stocks lost ground, while speculative
favourites were traded actively. Hitachi dipped Y16 to Y994 and Sony lost
Y10 at Y5,870. Steels were also hurt by profit-taking. Nippon Steel slipped
Y3 to Y387 and Kawasaki Steel Y4 to Y443.
Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, fell a further Y50 to Y4,900.
Traders said the company's price cut for an electronic game last week
discouraged investors, prompting them to sell short.
Nippon Kayaku plunged Y67 to Y710 on reports of problems with its cancer
drug. Chemical companies, supported by overseas investors last week, were
lower on profit-taking. Kureha Chemical shed Y20 to Y540.
Speculators supported Mitsubishi Oil on hopes for its oil development
project in Vietnam. The stock rose Y20 to Y1,100, while Ensuiko Sugar
Refining surged Y180 to Y2,570 on rumours concerning the company's
development of a cancer remedy.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 90.92 to 22,235.39 in volume of 26m
shares.
Roundup
The region was still tentative, and mixed. The Pakistan stock market closed
without trading in a mark of respect for Mr Aman Manai, general secretary of
the Karachi Stock Exchange agents' union, who died in a car crash in Saudi
Arabia.
SEOUL took profits on fears of a technical correction and the composite
index fell 18.53 or 1.7 per cent to 1,094.76. Only a few construction shares
and asset-play counters remained popular. Sambu Construction and Hyundai
Engineering and Construction each rose Won1,300 to Won39,500 and Won47,500
respectively.
HONG KONG fell on the weakness of the US dollar and on fears that the
Chinese economy might be out of control. The Hang Seng index closed 98.51
down at 9,320.06 in provisional turnover of HKDollars 2.88bn. Brokers said
that investors were waiting for yesterday's US trade figures and today's
government land auction.
Meanwhile, the China worries coincided oddly with a rise of 8.82 to 1,325.76
in the H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong, and a SHANGHAI A
share gain of 30.40 or 4.8 per cent to 666.62. But brokers said the Shanghai
rebound was strictly technical, with turnover thin at Yn1.46bn and market
sentiment still weak.
TAIPEI declined 1.3 per cent on profit-taking, the weighted index losing
86.43 at 6,669.10, off a 6,817.46 high. Turnover was heavy at TDollars
89.49bn. In SINGAPORE, light profit-taking left the Straits Times Industrial
index 19.87 points lower at 2,364.11.
SYDNEY rose on firmer futures and late buying interest, the All Ordinaries
index finishing 10.0 stronger at 2,013.4 in turnover of ADollars 388m.
Brokers said comments by Mr Bernie Fraser, the Reserve Bank governor, on
interest rates and inflation had no effect on trading.
Oils were firm on recent exploration news, with Woodside up 29 cents at
ADollars 5.14 and Santos 8 cents better at ADollars 3.94.
WELLINGTON was lifted by a 9-cent advance in Telecom, to NZDollars 5.38, and
the NZSE-40 index closed 9.25 higher at 2,061.66 in below-average turnover
of NZDollars 26m.
MANILA looked for third-quarter earnings prospects and the composite index
finished 6.39 ahead at 3,099.34.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Markets Report: US trade figures keep dollar under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar remained very weak on the currency markets yesterday, with the US
August trade figures providing further ammunition for the bears, writes
Philip Gawith.
Analysts said the report was doubly bad in that the US's trade deficit with
Japan had widened, refocusing attention on the US-Japan trade dispute, while
robust import growth had aggravated market fears about inflation,
undermining US bonds and the dollar.
Against the yen, the dollar closed in London at Y97.15, from Y97.685, after
touching a low of Y96.70. It was virtually unchanged at DM1.5009 from
DM1.5003. In New York it ended at Y97.325 and DM1.5015.
Mr Wayne Angell, chief economist at Bear Stearns, and a former Federal
Reserve Board governor, said the dollar's weakness was 'solely' attributable
to over-accommodative policy from the Fed. He said interest rates needed to
rise by 100 to 150 basis points to reach a neutral policy stance.
The D-Mark was generally firmer in Europe. It ended at FFr3.433 against the
French franc, from FFr3.431.
Sterling finished slightly higher against both the dollar and D-Mark, at
Dollars 1.6188 and DM2.4296. The trade weighted index closed at 80.2 from
80.
With the German elections out of the way, political volatility in France has
come into focus, fuelled by the resignation of the industry minister over
corruption allegations, and cabinet squabbles about the conservative
candidate in the 1995 presidential election.
'Political issues are still a big factor in the market,' said Mr Jeremy
Hawkins, chief economist at the Bank of America in London. Commenting on the
franc, he noted: 'It has again been weak against a not overly robust
D-Mark.'
Other political issues in the market at the moment include the upcoming US
congressional elections; and some evidence that political tensions in Russia
are causing weakness in the D-Mark.
Speculation about the likely abolition of the financial rand, the investment
currency for foreigners, has recently renewed focus on South African
currencies. This - and generalised dollar weakness - has helped the finrand
to strengthen. The discount to the commercial rand has shrunk to 11 per
cent, a level last seen around the time of the successful reform referendum
in February 1992.
The finrand breached the psychologically important R4 level to finish at
R3.96 against the dollar. The commercial rand ended at R3.5193.
Finrand traders in London said activity had been brisk but mostly
speculative, with no sign of large institutional orders. But Mr Emin Eyi,
head of South Africa sales at Baring Securities in London, said speculators
might have opened the door for other investors. He said net foreign
purchases of bonds and equities had risen in recent weeks. Referring to the
expected merger of the currencies, he said: 'There are not many currencies
that have a sure fire rise of 5 to 10 per cent built in.'
Mr Eyi predicted that the financial rand would continue to appreciate, but
said its abolition could probably only be expected in the first half of
1995, rather than imminently. The country's foreign reserve levels are still
too low, and there is little evidence as yet that it is seen as a pressing
political priority by the gov-ernment.
Following the granting of an investment grade credit rating recently, the
government is expected soon to announce its return to international capital
markets with a bond issue. The prospectus for the issue is likely to contain
more detail about a possible timetable for the abolition of the finrand.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 764m assistance to UK money markets,
compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 1.05bn. Overnight money traded
between 5 and 7 per cent.
In the gilt repo today, the Bank will provide the market with Pounds 1.28bn
assistance, maturing on November 10, at established rates. For the first
time since the repo facility was introduced in March, only the shorter
maturity date was taken up. There was no demand for the repo maturing on
November 24.
Analysts said this reflected the fact that market rates were fairly soft,
making investors reluctant to lock into a longer dated repo facility when
cheaper funding was available.
Today's repo will introduce a net injection of about Pounds 500m into the
system. This should take some pressure off the size of the daily shortages,
which have recently crept up to around Pounds 1bn.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India cuts import duty on
aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA, NEW DEHLI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's federal government has cut the import duty on aluminium to 10 per
cent ad valorem from 25 per cent because primary aluminium consumption is
rebounding strongly.
Domestic producers, although operating at a high level of capacity, are not
able to fully meet the demand for the metal from fabricators and extruders.
According to industry officials, the rising price of aluminium on the London
Metal Exchange was also behind the government's decision to lower the
customs duty.
But even at the revised duty, the imported metal will cost more than locally
produced aluminium. In recent months all domestic producers have raised
their aluminium prices.
Last year India imported about 45,000 tonnes of aluminium, while domestic
production was less than 500,000 tonnes. In the current year there has been
a sharp rise in demand for aluminium from the automobile and electrical
industry.
India's state-owned National Aluminium Company (Nalco) is to cut alumina
output by 10 per cent because of slack demand, Reuter reports from New
Dehli.
In 1993-94 Nalco produced 753,000 tonnes of alumina and exported 372,000
tonnes. Nalco's annual alumina production capacity is 800,000 tonnes a year
against world output of 40m tonnes.
An official said: 'Nalco had targeted exports of 400,000 tonnes of alumina
in 1994-95 but in the present scenaria the company might achieve exports of
370,000 tonnes. 'Demand for alumina had fallen mainly because of moves by
the world aluminium industry to deal with oversupply,' he added.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Booker's salmon leap to the top
 -The UK group's latest acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and RODERICK ORAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision by Booker, a UK food group, to buy the salmon farming
operations of Marine Harvest International of the US makes Booker the
biggest single salmon producer in the world. It is also a vote of confidence
in an industry which has repeatedly fallen into crisis in the past few
years.
No one is saying that the crises triggered by the sharply oscillating prices
caused by the market dominance of Norway, the biggest salmon producing
country in the world, will not recur. This year Norway's expected output of
220,000 tonnes will once again dwarf that of Scotland, the second biggest
producer, which is expected to harvest 59,000 tonnes. Chile comes third with
about 50,000 tonnes.
But the experience of the last few months gives some room for optimism. Only
a year ago Scottish salmon farmers despaired as another unexpected surge of
output by Norway pushed prices to their lowest level for several years. Yet,
against the predictions of many experts, prices have recovered since April
and a leading Norwegian salmon producer told a conference in Scotland this
month that in 1994 salmon farmers would have their most profitable year for
many years, despite the fact that prices are still below 1992 levels.
One reason is that in the past few years new vaccines have led to a sharp
drop in losses caused mainly by the disease furunculosis. Mortality rates at
McConnell Salmon, Booker's salmon subsidiary, fell from 12 per cent in
1990-91 to 5 per cent in 1993-94. Farmers have also invested in better
production equipment and introduced more efficient methods of husbandry,
producing bigger and better fish. The result is that the breakeven point for
most salmon farmers has dropped substantially as UK consumption has risen by
22 per cent in the year ended June.
'We've looked into the abyss on price and disease, and believe we can still
make money in salmon farming,' Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive of Booker,
said yesterday. 'We project the average, not the peaks, of salmon prices and
we assume salmon prices could fall.' On that basis, Booker, he suggested,
thinks it can still make money.
The takeover of Marine Harvest brings to Booker the biggest salmon producer
in Scotland, pushing its share of Scottish salmon production from about 9
per cent to just under 25 per cent. With output from Chile thrown in, Booker
will have about 7 per cent of the world market, with production of 26,000
tonnes of salmon a year out of world output of about 365,000 tonnes. The
next largest producer is probably Hydro Seafood of Norway, part of Norsk
Hydro.
Operations will be more efficient after the takeover. Booker will close
Marine Harvest's heaquarters in New Jersey, and merge the two companies'
research and development departments, saving about Pounds 3m a year.
The acquisition of Marine Harvest's salmon farming operation in Chile brings
it a set of farms in a country which has the lowest production costs in the
world, thanks to excellent water and growing conditions, and low labour
costs. These benefits amount to a saving of 5p per pound off production
costs which in Scotland are about Pounds 1 per lb.
The takeover also gives Booker access to the Japanese and US markets. But
the cost advantage of producing in Chile is offset by the cost of
transporting fish to the US market, making Chile overall only as competitive
as US salmon producers.
The resulting diversification of production and markets should mean that no
more than 10 per cent of Booker's output could suffer a disease problem at
any one time. In any event, salmon turnover will still be only about Pounds
100m, compared with the group's total of Pounds 3.5bn.
However, the danger of a future glut of salmon on the European market
remains as Norway continues to push up output faster than Scotland. To
prevent this, Booker has led a campaign to establish a system to regulate
salmon output in Scotland, Norway and Ireland. Farmers would form producer
groups and agree production quotas which they hope would maintain prices.
But for the scheme to work their governments would have to permit the
producer organisations to enforce controls on non-members, which the UK
government rejects, saying it would harm the consumer.
Whatever the outcome, Booker believes that creating a Scottish-based company
with about 25 per cent of production will help strengthen the industry as it
comes under attack from Norway.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals surge as nickel touches
two-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices on the London Metal Exchange rose sharply yesterday, helped by
renewed interest from investment funds and a weakening dollar which made
metals look cheaper in other currencies.
Aluminium prices touched a fresh four-year high and nickel joined the party
to go briefly to its highest level for two years before substantial
profit-taking stopped the upward momentum. At the close, aluminium was up
another USDollars 9.25 a tonne at Dollars 1,741.50, copper had advanced by
Dollars 51 to Dollars 2,539.50 and nickel was up Dollars 205 at Dollars
6,895 a tonne.
Nickel, used mainly for production of stainless steel, reached Dollars 6,950
at one stage, a 42 per cent rise from the Dollars 4,000 low point it touched
last year, in spite of LME stocks standing at a record 150,000 tonnes or an
estimated 11 weeks of consumption.
Analysts suggested that investment funds were anticipating strong demand for
metals next year and helping to push up prices before increased consumption
reduced stocks.
Mr Heinz Pariser of Heinz H Pariser Alloy Metals &amp; Steel Market Research,
said at an LME seminar last week that nickel consumption this year was
likely to grow by 7.7 per cent and reach a record 740,000 tonnes.
A 'moderate' further increase of 2.7 per cent was forecast for 1995 followed
by a rise of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent in 1996 and 1997.
This would create a 33,000-tonnes supply shortage in 1994 and 40,000 tonnes
next year. Mr Pariser said nickel prices were likely to average Dollars
6,390 a tonne this year.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EU proposes higher banana
import quota
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has proposed a 53,400-tonne increase in its quota
for banana imports from Latin America this year in order to assist the
Windward Islands where agricultural areas were devastated by tropical storm
Debbie in September.
Governments from the Windward Islands had asked if they could import bananas
from other destinations while they are unable to fill their own import
allocations.
This will enable them to maintain their market share in the European Union
while they rebuild their damaged plantations.
The Commission has allocated additional tonnages of 30,000 tonnes to
Martinique, 14,800 tonnes to St Lucia, 5,900 to Guadeloupe and 2,700 to
Dominica.
Mr John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia, said recently that 68 per cent
of the country's banana crop worth Pounds 45m had been wiped out by the
tropical storm. He said it will take two years to repair the damage.
The increase in quota takes EU banana imports from Latin America to 2.171m
tonnes this year.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Watch out for the garlic -
Innovation in the UK food sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Garlic growers of France, beware. Consumption of the pungent bulb in
southern England has overtaken that of northern France, largely thanks to
one enthusiastic grower on the Isle of Wight.
Mr Colin Boswell has turned his Mersley Farms into one of the biggest garlic
producers in northern Europe in the 15 years since he diversified out of
sweetcorn. Britain's first indigenous garlic grower, he is now the country's
leading supplier of fresh and prepared garlic products.
His innovative approach - which includes his own brand of Smoked Garlic
Butter - won him a national award for food marketing this week. British
farmers are much criticised for failing to market their produce
successfully, and the awards are designed to raise standards and help reduce
the UK's food and drink trade deficit of nearly Pounds 6bn (Dollars 8bn).
'Mersley Farms is a clear example of a producer who has become simply the
best in his field,' said Mr Colin Smith, fresh produce trading director at
Tesco, the supermarket group which sponsored the food awards. 'Not only is
Colin Boswell wholly committed to his exceptional product, but he has shown
clear marketing expertise in creating a range of added-value garlic
products.'
Beating the French at their own game proved a winner for two other British
producers. Mr Julian Temperley, owner of a large area of cider orchards in
Somerset, wanted to add value to his product because of increasing
competition in cider production. So he created the first commercially
produced cider brandy in Britain for three centuries.
The Somerset Cider Brandy Company makes 15,000 bottles a year of Somerset
Royal, which is similar to Normandy Calvados but has the distinctive flavour
of Somerset apples.
Tuddenham Hall Foods of Suffolk decided there was a market for tender
English asparagus that could be eaten from tip to base and they managed to
double turnover of their pre-packed delicacy in two years.
Food buyers agree that British farm produce is of a high quality but
complain they cannot always obtain the quantity they need when they need it.
Mr Mike Bunney of Adas, the government's agricultural advisory service which
sponsored the awards, said: 'Marketing is not strong among quite a chunk of
the industry, who fail to differentiate their product from their
competitors.' But he added that more farmers and processors were tailoring
their product to their customers' needs.
One Somerset meat producer, Peninsular Pigs, received an award for its
successful collaboration with Marks &amp; Spencer, supplying the retailer with
all the fresh pork it sells.
'Peninsular Pigs had clearly thought very hard about their market, and, by
talking to the retailer, spotted an opportunity for meat of a superior
eating quality, reared outdoors under a strictly controlled,
welfare-friendly system,' said Mr Jeremy Finnis of the ministry of
agriculture, which sponsored the award.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (8): An attractive proposal - A
pipeline could link the UK to wider markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHAEL OUSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
December could see the end Britain's isolation from the continental gas grid
with the construction of a pipeline connecting England and Belgium.
Such a link could open up trading to and from the vast European gas network,
widening horizons for gas companies that have already adapted well to new
opportunities in the competitive UK market. But is a pipeline commercially
viable and the best option for future UK gas trade?
The proposed 300m interconnector consists of a 250km high pressure gas
pipeline from Bacton in eastern England to Zeebrugge in Belgium. Although
capacity is not definite, the central case has a range of possible flow
rates from 9bn cubic metres (Bcm)/yr up to an anticipated maximum 15 Bcm/yr
through a 38-inch diameter line. A larger option - a 40-inch line with
capacity up to 20 Bcm - is also being considered.
An interconnector study group, comprising seven project sponsors - British
Gas, British Petroleum, Conoco, Distrigaz of Belgium, France's Elf and Norsk
Hydro and Statoil of Norway - has been set up to examine the feasibility of
the proposed pipeline link.
The UK government, and in particular industry and energy minister Tim Eggar,
see in the interconnector as an export route in the short term, providing an
outlet for valuable gas exports to the continent.
Detractors have suggested low gas prices on continental Europe make it
difficult to imagine more expensive gas flowing from the UK to continental
buyers. But others suggest present-day prices are irrelevant as there will
be a potential surplus of gas from UK continental shelf fields over the next
15 years or so which cannot be absorbed by the UK market alone, already at a
high level of penetration.
The interconnector's viability would clearly be enhanced by a strong
commitment from a leading producer to use this route. There are suggestions
the UK government is putting pressure on Norwegian gas producer Statoil to
put some of its volumes through the interconnector. The apparent trade-off
would be a softening of the UK government position on imports of gas from
Norway to the UK.
The current Frigg treaty allowing Norwegian imports will expire when Frigg
gas runs out in 1996-7, but discussions over a future treaty have reached
impasse between the Norwegian and British governments. This is in spite of
supply contracts negotiated between Statoil and British buyers such as
National Power and ScottishPower.
Mr Eggar may be prepared to look more favourably on Norwegian imports in
return for support by the Norwegians for the interconnector. Statoil already
has four pipelines into continental Europe and is considering a fifth to
meet future commitments. While the interconnector route carries additional
costs of transporting gas via the British Gas network from St Fergus in
Scotland to Bacton, on the plus side it could offer Statoil further
diversity of export options.
The initial interconnector project concept clearly separated ownership and
capacity interests, but interconnector group commercial director Paul Reed
said a consistent theme in discussions had been the perceived risk balance
between owners and shippers. In May, the group changed its strategy to offer
shippers equity in the line linked to the level of booked capacity, to
increase the project's chances of success.
Given the probable creditworthiness of shareholders in the line and the
transport terms, the group does not see financing as problematic. Funding
options under consideration include shareholder loans, guaranteed bank loans
(possibly including the European Investment Bank) and UK finance leasing.
Capital market funding post-completion will also be considered.
Shippers expressing interest in using the interconnector must indicate their
willingness to make long-term capacity bookings by letter to the steering
group by the end of November. A signing meeting for final participants is
scheduled for December 8, after which a company will be formed.
Mr Reed said about 20 companies had expressed interest in booking capacity.
Of these he expects 10-12 to make final commitments. Initial bids for
capacity from shippers ranged from around 0.5 Bcm to 3.0 Bcm, with an
average around 1.5 Bcm, but some larger bids are expected. BP has already
announced it expects to take up to a 20 per cent stake, according to BP
managing director John Browne.
Mr Reed is confident the interconnector will be built and suggests 'it is
not a case of if, but more a case of how big'.
The Bacton-Zeebrugge project does not end with construction of the pipeline.
Transportation of increased volumes of gas from landing points such as St
Fergus or Teesside will require British Gas to reinforce its network,
unblocking bottle-necks in the system. Harry Moulson, managing director of
BG TransCo, the transportation and storage business unit, has suggested this
reinforcement could cost more than the interconnector itself.
A working group he established to look at the level of reinforcement
required produced three scenarios of different volumes arriving at different
terminals. Shippers are being encouraged to give estimates of future demand.
Similar reinforcement issues face Belgian gas company Distrigaz which will
be carrying gas from Zeebrugge to other European destinations.
The study group examined whether the interconnector would be the most
economic means of either taking UKCS (UK Continental Shelf) gas into the
European market or bringing continental gas into Britain. On comparing the
hypothetical cost of transporting gas from a field in the central North Sea
to a customer in Germany via the interconnector with the cost of sending gas
via a direct line from the field to a German landfall, it found the
estimated pre-tax transportation cost per therm of the interconnector route
to be about 5.4 pence, 0.5 pence lower than the alternative.
While the price advantage may seem insignificant, the group claims
advantages in terms of capital efficiency and early cash flow of opting for
tariff payments instead of up-front capital expenditure make the
interconnector a more attractive option in terms of post-tax cash flow.
This benefit is made more significant by the flexibility and grid-to-grid
nature of the interconnector. In addition, The interconnector is not
field-specific and can offer economies of scale and new trading
opportunities such as swaps, peak shaving, aggregation and pooling of
capacity.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (7): 'Let markets lead the way'
 -David Lascelles meets the head of Ofgas, the industry regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clare Spottiswoode has a dual role to play as the UK prepares to deregulate
its domestic gas market. As director general of Ofgas, the industry
regulator, she is working with the government to set out the rules for the
new market. And once deregulation has occurred, she will oversee the market
to ensure order and fair play.
Ms Spottiswoode came to the job nearly a year ago after a career as a
Treasury economist and more recently a businesswoman in her own right.
Although she had limited experience of the gas industry, she had a strong
personal belief in the virtue of free markets and competition - a belief
which she says has strengthened since she came to Ofgas.
This view has shaped her approach to the regulatory issues. She would rather
have a free market and use regulatory action to correct flaws, than
intervene in every detail. 'We'll try and let markets do it; if not, we'll
find a technical way through,' she says.
Competition is also the best way to get British Gas to shed its huge 'legacy
costs', as she calls them. 'Regulation can only ever nibble away at the
edges. Nothing can engender the culture shock that competition can,' she
says.
Ms Spottiswoode has advised the government to draw up a brief Gas Bill which
provides the enabling legislation but leaves the detail to the terms of the
operating licences which she will issue to public gas suppliers (PGS).
Although this will put a lot of power in her hands, she says it will give
the system the necessary flexibility to evolve.
PGS will have the right to seek judicial review if they disagree with her
rulings. But Ms Spottiswoode also says she expects parliament to give her
guidance about the line she should take.
One of the first issues she will have to address is who to give licences to
in order to ensure that the market works. She will not insist that
applicants cover particular geographical segments of the market. Would-be
PGS will be allowed to define their markets however they wish. Many, Ms
Spottiswoode believes, will want to operate nationwide: no PGS need actually
own any gas pipelines to provide a service so there should be no
geographical constraints.
However some applicants may be organisations such as housing associations
which define their markets by residential type rather than geographical
area.
If, once the licences have been issued, there are gaps in the market which
leave some areas without a gas supply, she will use her powers to 'stretch'
existing licences to ensure that these areas are covered. Similarly, she
will be able to command companies to patch up holes in the market if a
supplier goes out of business.
The next problem is how to avoid cherrypicking: new suppliers going for the
choice markets and the easy profits.
Ms Spottiswoode believes this problem has been exaggerated, and says it can
be dealt with by identifying the people to be protected and including the
necessary obligations in the licence.
There are three issues.
One is energy efficiency. There will be a requirement on PGS to give advice
on efficient use of gas.
Another is care for the elderly and disabled. The PGS will have to cater to
their needs, although Ms Spottiswoode does not believe that these costs will
be particularly heavy. She points out that the elderly tend to have good
payment records. 'The costs are so small that suppliers won't try to avoid
them,' she says. It is even possible that a PGS may choose to specialise in
the market for people whose bills are paid by social security.
The third is debt and disconnections - or bad customers. Ms Spottiswoode
says that many people fell into this category in the past because there was
no incentive for British Gas to catch them before their debts became
unmanageable. In the new market, suppliers will keep a much closer eye on
payments so that non-payers can be spotted early, she says.
Although many expect the new suppliers to offer discounts to the better
payers in order to lure them away from British Gas, Ms Spottiswoode says
that it would make commercial sense for British Gas to cut prices first
since these customers are cheaper to serve. That way, all prices will tend
down to the discounted level, and cherrypicking will be much harder.
Ms Spottiswoode maintains that deregulation will not mean price increases -
as some critics have argued. She expects most prices to fall. 'I don't see
that anyone will lose as a result of competition,' she says. 'Maybe just a
few, but they will be caught by the social security net.' However she admits
that this is 'a leap of faith' on her part because no other country has gone
as far as the UK in deregulating its utilities.
All these plans, however, depend on the government giving the go-ahead for
gas deregulation - something that will be revealed in the Queen's Speech in
mid-November.
Ms Spottiswoode is optimistic. She says that support for deregulation is
widespread. British Gas wants it, so do the consumer associations, she says.
'When we started work on this we thought there were a lot of contentious
issues. But there are not really that many. The real problem is the
legislative timetable.'
Ms Spottiswoode intends to deliver this message when she appears before the
Trade and and Industry Select Committee of the House of Commons next week.
But if the government decides not go ahead with the gas bill in the next
session of parliament, what could she do to preserve the head of steam that
has built up behind deregulation?
It would be possible to lower the threshold at which competition can enter
the market, but that would still require an order to be laid before
parliament. If parliament did nothing, the process of change 'could fizzle
out' creating instability, she says. But she would work hard behind the
scenes to ensure that that did not happen.
If gas is not in the Queen's Speech, she hopes that John Major, the prime
minister, would at least make a statement promising to deal with it next
year. That would be sufficient to keep investors interested.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (5): Operations to be combined -
The regional electricity companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All 14 electricity distribution companies on mainland Britain and PowerGen
and National Power, the generation companies, proudly boast their own gas
supply arms. Some will undoubtedly make a success of them.
But it is highly unlikely that all 16 companies will still be involved in
what is certain to be a fiercely competitive market by the end of the
decade. A few are expected to withdraw within the next year or so,
particularly if the government delays full competition in gas beyond 1998.
Few, if any, companies are likely to lose large sums of money since setting
up gas trading teams, often of half a dozen people or less, has not entailed
significant investment. But companies which withdraw will have to explain
why a diversification that seemed too attractive to miss two years ago has
failed to deliver its promise.
The initial attractions were plain enough. The recent regulatory review of
the regional companies distribution businesses underlined the perceived need
from the City and elsewhere for power companies to develop a range of
businesses which can make money in competitive and therefore unregulated
markets.
The companies certainly have the means to be able to diversify. All the
regional distributors and the generators either have cash surpluses or low
borrowings. The problem for them is to do so without arousing doubts among
investors about whether they are capable of managing the non-power
businesses they grow or acquire.
The gas supply business has proved a lure because of its similarities and
potential synergies with electricity.
The regional companies have long experience of operating in a low margin
trading business and have developed energy trading expertise which can be
used in supplying gas.
In many cases, the customers to whom they sell gas will be the same as those
who buy their power. Electricity companies can make use of their brand name
and the knowledge they have of the customers to improve their marketing.
Some have merged their gas and electricity sales teams. Billing systems can
be merged and, as technology develops, metering equipment can be shared.
There are also synergies with companies' generation arms. SG Warburg
Securities regional electricity companies with gas-fired generation - that
is all of them except Manweb - should be able to 'swing' between gas
generation and gas supply.
This, it says, should reduce the risk of over-contracting and potentially
increase operating margins as a result of seasonal demand.
Kleinwort Benson makes a similar point about National Power and PowerGen in
a recent research document. 'By developing a gas marketing business and a
combined heat and power operations, which uses gas to drive operations, a
generator has three alternative sources for any gas it buys including its
own gas-fired power stations. This enables it selectively to target its
supplies of gas, attaining the highest margins possible.'
PowerGen was one of the first electricity companies to enter the competitive
gas market after setting up a joint venture, Kinetica, with Conoco in 1990.
In 1993-4, Kinetica, contributed Pounds 8m to PowerGen's pre-tax profits on
sales of Pounds 130m.
Among the distribution companies, Midlands Electricity was the first to move
into gas marketing in August 1991. It has a 75:25 joint venture, Midlands
Gas, with Utilicorp and is generally considered to be one of the strongest
emerging players in the market.
Utilicorp also has joint ventures with Norweb, Scottish Power, Seeboard,
Sweb and Eastern. Northern Gas, the Norweb joint venture, recently announced
plans to set up a national gas marketing company.
Total is among other overseas companies involved with regional electricity
companies; it has joint ventures with London and Yorkshire. Marathon Oil &amp;
Gas has a joint venture with Hydro-Electric.
The companies with most commitment to gas are those which have gone
upstream. This summer Eastern Electricity bought a 6 per cent stake in the
Johnson North Sea oil field, having previously agreed to buy its entire
output.
Northern Electric, the last regional electricity company to move into gas
supply, created an upstream gas venture with Neste of Finland and has a
stake in the Victor field. Yorkshire has 7 per cent of the Armada gas field,
which it bought for Pounds 27m from Amerada Hess.
The aim of those companies moving upstream is to develop integrated gas
businesses.
Analysts believe that if the going gets tough these companies will be the
last to pull out of gas supply simply because they will have to find other
markets in which to sell the gas they are producing.
Most believe that the going will get tough. Kevin Lapwood, analyst at Smith
New Court, says the regional electricity companies' gas businesses have not
lived up to expectations.
'When the market first opened up it was money for old rope, because British
Gas was under pressure to give up market share,' says Mr Lapwood. 'But as
the market opened up further the competition got tougher. Nobody is losing
much money yet but, with margins so thin, there are quite a few companies
who are unlikely to make much.'
SG Warburg believes that margins could be as low as 1 per cent when the
market is opened up fully. 'This could threaten some regional electric
companies' continued involvement in gas, given the long wait for
deregulation, of the high margin domestic market,' says analyst Nick Pink.
The two main risks, says Warburg , are bad debts and failing to sell all the
gas bought from a supplier to an end-user. That, in turn, could result in a
distressed sale.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (6): Uncertainty causes delays /
A look at the concerns of independent gas companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quadrant, Alliance and Kinetica, just a few of the more than 40 companies
which make up the UK's independent gas sector, may not be household names.
But in many cases their shareholders are. A large number of the biggest oil
and gas companies in the world have been drawn to the UK gas market, the
fifth largest in the world and one of the fastest growing.
For most oil and gas producers, the appeal is simple: the opening of the
domestic gas market is an opportunity to extract a higher value from North
Sea gas reserves than was possible in the past by selling to British Gas,
for years the only buyer. Some also see the gas market as a logical
downstream expansion. Natural gas is a product which can be marketed
alongside other energy sources such as petrol, electricity or home heating
oil.
The government's liberalisation programme has also encouraged relative
minnows to swim alongside the oil majors. John Astrop, commercial director
of Kinetica, a joint venture between PowerGen of the UK and US oil company
Conoco, says it is still possible for 'someone sitting in a room with a
telephone and a fax to run a gas supply business'.
Both minnows and majors, however, have been worried that the government will
fail to put forward legislation to open the domestic market. The
independents have mounted an intense lobbying campaign in recent months to
reassure politicians that retail gas prices are likely to fall once
competition takes hold.
The political uncertainty has caused many independents to delay making the
investments needed to operate in a competitive domestic market. Companies
say it is also having an effect on decisions about whether to develop some
North Sea gas fields and worry that prolonged delays could undermine the
continuing support from their parent companies needed to stay in the market.
The political uncertainty also coincides with growing competition and
falling margins in those segments of the market open to competition.
In recent years Ofgas, the industry regulator, has encouraged competition by
setting market share targets in the mainly commercial and industrial
segments above 2,500 therms a year. It also required British Gas to make
available large quantities of gas to the independents as another means of
encouraging competition.
The low overheads of the independents enabled them to undercut British Gas
prices by 10-15 per cent, and they have quickly captured the mandated 55 per
cent of the firm contract market above 2,500 therms a year.
But the healthy margins the independents enjoyed in the early stages of
competition have disappeared as the focus of competition has shifted away
from taking market share from British Gas to intense competition between the
independents.
The intensity of the competition is reflected in the fact that the
independents submit 15,000 nominations a week to TransCo, the monopoly gas
transporter, for quotes on the cost of transporting gas to potential
customers. But only 1,500 result in firm contracts, according to TransCo.
Most independents believe the tough operating environment will trigger a
wave of rationalisation in the sector over the next two to three years. 'The
people who look most vulnerable are those without heavyweight financial
backing,' says one industry executive.
Others say some of the 'true independents' - those not connected with North
Sea producers and which do not have ready access to cheap supplies of gas -
may be forced to retreat to niche markets or confine their activities to gas
trading.
The tough financial conditions likely to be required by the government to
qualify for a public gas supply licence may also cause some companies to
drop out, say industry analysts. But the sheer size of the domestic market
encourages a number of companies. Just a 5 per cent market share would still
translate into nearly 1m customers, spending on average more than Pounds 250
a year.
Details of the market strategies likely to be used by the independents will
not be known until the conditions of the public gas supply licences are
agreed. But several basic approaches are becoming apparent.
One is the total energy package, with companies likely to offer electricity
as well as gas. Some packages may also contain energy savings schemes to
induce consumers to switch suppliers, although prices are likely to be the
focus in the initial stages of competition.
Some companies intend to link their gas business to existing downstream
activities. Total, for example, says its customers will be able to pay their
gas bills at their petrol stations. There is also the possibility that gas
consumers will be included in the promotional schemes now run by oil
companies at their service stations.
Ofgas officials say they would be pleased to see non-energy companies enter
the business. These could include credit card companies with existing large
billing systems able to handle hundreds of thousands of accounts.
But industry executives say it is more likely that oil and gas companies
would form joint ventures with big retailers, such as supermarket or
department store chains. 'The marketplace could become a battleground for
brand names,' says one.
If it does, most independents concede that the strongest brand name is
likely to remain British Gas. They worry that consumer inertia could prove
the biggest barrier to their expansion into the market, and cite British
Telecom as an example of how consumers stick to their existing supplier even
though a cheaper alternative is available.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (2): Facing commercial reality -
Robert Corzine finds British Gas in an aggressively confident mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month British Gas topped off a turbulent year by unveiling a
much-delayed presentation on its strategy to the end of the decade and
beyond.
Gone, according Richard Giordano, chairman, was the old British Gas, a
public utility whose 'mindset was driven first and foremost by the
obligation to serve . . . at any cost if necessary'.
In its place will come a new British Gas, a 'dynamic and commercially
astute' company which will dramatically restructure its domestic businesses
over the next few years. This should ensure sufficient cash flow to fund a
big international expansion which will begin to pay off in the next century.
Gone too, says Mr Giordano, will be a corporate culture determined to 'fight
dogged regulatory battles to defend a proud past'.
For British Gas's would-be competitors in the UK gas market, Mr Giordano's
statement and similar comments from Cedric Brown, chief executive, offered a
reassurance that Europe's 13th largest company would no longer stand in the
way of the introduction of domestic competition.
But the comments also contained an implied threat that British Gas would not
idly stand by and see its domestic market share eroded, as has happened
under regulatory pressure in the liberalised market for large commercial and
industrial users.
Last month's presentation also offered evidence that the 'strategic
paralysis' that gripped British Gas in recent years as senior management
fought pitched battles with its regulator, has receded, along with what Mr
Giordano described as the 'regulatory fog'. The result is that the company
has been confident enough to map out a coherent way forward.
What is less clear, however, is how successful it will be in implementing
such a radical realignment.
There is little doubt that senior management is determined to overturn the
corporate culture of a long-standing monopoly. A root-and-branch
restructuring of the company means that 25,000 employees - a third of the
workforce - will be made redundant over the next three years.
Employee morale, aside from the handful of executives and managers who know
they will have a job after the re-structuring, is low. Some employees say
management has been surprised by the large number of highly-skilled
individuals who intend to accept voluntary redundancy, rather than subject
themselves to further uncertainty.
For most of those who do undergo and survive the current programme of having
to re-apply for their jobs, there will no longer be the prospect of a job
for life in the highly hierarchical, command and control environment of the
old British Gas. In the coming months thousands of employees, especially
those in the public gas supply division that deals directly with the public,
will undergo extensive training sessions to prepare them for a commercial
environment.
In addition, the five domestic divisions will be recruiting people with
marketing experience outside the gas industry to help ensure that a
commercial culture takes hold.
Mr Brown was adamant at the strategy review that 'there are no sacred cows
at British Gas'. The managing directors at each of the business units know
they must 'transform' their companies to suit the new commercial realities,
or face a fate that senior executives have not spelled out, but which
industry observers say is the threat of divestment.
Speculation is most intense about the future of the public gas supply, the
unit which provides 18m households with gas and which will face the brunt of
the competition once the domestic market is opened.
Mike Alexander, PGS managing director, says he is preparing the division for
an extended period of uncertainty. The intense competition his division is
likely to encounter when the domestic market is fully opened in 1998 means
PGS staff numbers, set to fall from 11,300 currently to 9,600 by 1996, may
face even deeper cuts.
The present Gas Act forbids British Gas from divesting the unit, but Mr
Brown made it clear that month that if the company's competitors have the
right to restructure their businesses, 'then so should we'.
The outlook for other parts of the company is generally more upbeat.
TransCo, the pipeline and storage division remains a regulated monopoly. It
is the main repository of British Gas' technical skills and assets. It will
also be the 'main cash generator in the short to medium term', according to
Mr Brown.
The exploration and production arm of the company has a steeply rising UK
production profile that will support the growth of corporate cash flow to
the year 2000. The UK operation will also help to underwrite the company's
growing efforts to discover and develop mainly gas reserves in other
countries.
Many of the those upstream developments will be linked to downstream
ventures in which British Gas intends to apply its UK skills and experience
to gas distribution or gas-fired power generation schemes worldwide. Many of
these will be in fast-growing developing economies, especially in Latin
America and Asia, according to company executives.
The company expects such international activities to be the main engine of
growth in the early years of the next century.
But as the company's top executives acknowledged last month, the success of
the long-term strategy is dependent on the company being competitive and
profitable in its fast-changing UK markets for the foreseeable future.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (4): Trading approaches -
Creating a UK spot market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of almost half of the UK's daily gas supply requirements being
turned over on a traded market or even the introduction of a gas futures
contract is still some way from reality in Britain. But this is just what
happened in the US where gas supply was deregulated just over 10 years ago.
Now, shippers are confident they can turn to a well-established spot market
for daily sales and purchases.
Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, is keen to see the creation of an
efficient spot market in the UK to assist the development of competition
when British Gas's monopoly over household supply is abolished in 1996.
Earlier this month , the regulator published a discussion document on a spot
market, calling for views from the industry by early November on what steps
should be taken to set it up.
'In order to secure the successful introduction of sustainable competition
in gas supply, a daily market for gas has to evolve which is fully effective
and efficient,' said Mark Higson, director of network operations at Ofgas.
'We want participants to tell us the type of market that they would like to
see evolve and what steps should be taken to develop a market.'
The need to establish a spot market arises from the daily balancing
requirements of the gas supply network. Once British Gas's monopoly over
household supply is removed in April 1996, many of the independent shippers
will be pumping gas into homes through the company's pipelines network which
is run by its TransCo division.
These shippers will be required to balance their customer requirements on a
daily basis - matching supply and demand which can fluctuate wildly, for
example, when the weather turns suddenly colder.
The debate over a spot market centres around how sophisticated this
balancing system should be - whether it should be just that: a way to square
up companies' needs on a daily basis or a fully-fledged marketplace with
posted bids and offers for gas.
In its discussion document, Ofgas has laid out proposals by British Gas for
a balancing system as well as a model for gas trading developed by the gas
supply arms of two regional electricity companies: Eastern Natural Gas and
Manweb Gas with Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, among other
suggestions.
The regulator wants to answer several questions surrounding spot sales and
purchases.
For example, it asks whether deliberate attempts should be made to create a
'liquid and transparent on-the-day operational gas market', or whether the
market should be left to evolve without such intervention.
The document also asks the industry: 'Is it necessary or desirable to take a
view now on whether or not to proceed with a deeper market or can that wait
until later?'
British Gas is eager to see the development of some sort of marketplace in
order to encourage competition. The company needs a flexibility mechanism to
balance the network - but this doesn't have to be a spot market. 'It's
important for us to have something that moves us forward,' one official
said.
But some independent industry players are sceptical about the view that a
marketplace can be imposed on gas trading, and many believe that spot sales
and purchases should be left to develop organically into a larger market.
'There is a certain amount of trading that goes on now at the gas terminals:
more of this is on a daily basis in winter,' said Roger Turner, managing
director at Utilicorp UK. 'When the need for daily balancing comes in, the
commercial and market pressures for daily trading will increase and spot
markets will develop in their own time.'
Mr Turner believes that spot markets will develop at the gas hubs where
supply from the North Sea is brought on shore rather than in a central
marketplace.
This means that daily trading will be closely linked to the physical market
supply. Some sort of clearing house or market agent may need to be provided
by a separate company such as an investment bank.
'I'm sure that after a year or two, we'll all have screens on our desks with
daily and more long-term prices quoted from the terminals around the
country,' he said.
Since the government has not yet produced legislation to open up the
household supply market, some independent operators believe that it may be
too soon to be deciding the details of how the market may work.
Alan Marshall, managing director at Agas, believes a spot market will
develop if there is a real need for one.
'There may well be a need for some sort of clearing house arrangement which
allows requirements to be balanced on the day, but that depends on how many
players there are in the market,' he said.
One of Ofgas's fears and a concern for some in the gas business is that a
spot market which develops gradually may not be as transparent as a formal
trading arena.  If gas is bought and sold in smoke-filled rooms where
private deals are done it will be hard to establish market prices applicable
to all participants.
Ofgas's document says: 'Confidence that economic pricing signals are being
generated transparently would be a key factor in encouraging reliance on the
market and hence enabling the industry to add short term supplies to
existing long term contract arrangements.'
This is why proposals by Morgan Stanley and the two regional electricity
companies include the setting up of a commodity market with screen-based
trading.  Shippers hope that a mix of proposals will be adopted from the
varying suggestions in Ofgas's paper, but are not looking for any rigid
market proscriptions.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (3): Fixing the cracks - TransCo
and the independents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineers at British Gas's national transmission system control centre at
Hinkley in the Midlands can tell you exactly what they were doing on
February 14 1994. For on that day a cold snap triggered off a record surge
in demand for natural gas.
By the end of the day TransCo, British Gas's transportation and storage
division, had carried a record 355.25m cubic metres of gas, compared with a
daily average of just 168.1mcm.
The engineers say the fact that they were able to cope with such a strong
surge in demand testifies to the wisdom of years of heavy investment in a
transport and distribution system that Richard Giordano, British Gas
chairman, recently called the 'biggest and best in the world'. Critics,
however, say it is over-engineered and over-built.
The creation of Solihull-based TransCo, whose assets are valued at Pounds
17bn, stems from British Gas's decision last March to split the UK business
into five domestic divisions. It will retain its status as a national
monopoly under the government's liberalisation plan, and is the clear core
activity of British Gas's UK operations.
It will also play a central role in the introduction of competition in the
domestic market. All of the independent marketers as well as British Gas's
public gas supply division will use its pipelines to distribute gas to the
18m or so household customers.
Transportation costs account for about half of the total bill paid by
residential consumers. So the degree to which TransCo cuts its cost base
over the next few years will have a big effect on the extent to which
domestic gas prices might fall with the onset of competition.
Harry Moulson, TransCo's managing director, and his staff of senior
executives say they are determined to build an efficient,
commercially-driven organisation which is responsive to the needs of its
growing list of customers.
But relations between it and the independents operating in the commercial
and industrial markets already opened to competition have not always been
smooth.
Last year a number of disputes arose over the slow pace at which TransCo
provided billing information to the independents. Mr Moulson attributes the
problems to the unexpected speed at which independents took market share
away from British Gas's trading arm.
'We believed there would be 3,000-10,000 supply points (for the
independents),' he said. 'Now there are 120,000, and we've had to keep it
together through fire-fighting.' Shortcomings in the current computer system
added to the frustration felt by shippers.
TransCo has since designated senior account managers to try to alleviate the
tensions. Les Dawson, one of the managers, says: 'Twelve to 15 months ago
most shippers said they had difficulties dealing with us. Now its just a
handful'.
Trust has developed slowly, but some companies are now providing TransCo
with details of future business plans. There have even been instances when
TransCo executives accompanied the independents on sales presentations to
potential customers, a development which would have been unheard of only
last year. In addition some TransCo staff may eventually be stationed in the
offices of the independents to ensure a speedier service.
Mr Moulson says TransCo's new commercial outlook means that it would even
consider joint ventures on future pipeline projects.
A document spelling out the main elements of the future relationship between
TransCo and its customers is currently under consideration. The Network Code
will define in detail the commercial and operating regime which will
underpin a competitive market.
David Dewar, TransCo's development director, admits that the atmosphere
during early meetings on the code was 'pretty dire'. He believes there has
been a 'dramatic' improvement in recent months, although he worries that the
present political impasse could undermine the commitment of some
independents to taking part in what is inevitably a time-consuming and
highly technical process.
There are still many issues, however, on which TransCo and the independents
disagree. At present shippers do not have to supply to TransCo on a daily
basis the gas their customers consume. But the present system of monthly
balancing means that TransCo is 'physically and financially' subsidising
them, according to Mr Dewar.
The biggest disagreement, however, concerns the valuation of TransCo's
assets. Ofgas, the industry regulator, agreed to put off until 1997 a
root-and-branch revaluation because of the pressing need to separate
TransCo's activities from British Gas's trading arms, and to prepare the
company for competition.
The independents say a lower valuation could pave the way for substantially
lower transportation charges, and hence lower domestic prices.
TransCo officials say such demands should be treated with caution, given the
constant need to renew and reinforce the network to prepare for future
growth, and for the cold winter days which could be just around the corner.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Survey of the UK Gas Market (1): Support for liberalisation
gathers pace - Although political uncertainties continue to surround the
planned opening of the UK gas market, Robert Corzine finds there is a
growing belief that competition can be made to work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten months have passed since the government gave the go-ahead for the
planned liberalisation of the UK gas market, the fifth largest in the world
and one of the fastest growing. But the subject has continued to spark off
intense debate among industry executives, politicians and consumer groups.
Last December, Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, brushed
aside warnings from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and approved a
fast-track timetable for the full opening of the domestic gas market in
1998.
It was high time, he said, that the 18m household consumers now served by
British Gas had a choice of supplier.
Officials from Ofgas, the industry regulator, spoke of a future in which a
multitude of suppliers would emerge. Supermarket and department store
chains, as well as credit card companies, might vie against the gas
subsidiaries of leading oil companies and regional electricity companies for
a share in the market.
But by the summer, the brave new competitive gas world envisioned by the
government and Ofgas was fast falling apart. The idea that millions of
consumers (and voters) would soon be counting the cash saved as a result of
introducing competition gave way to front page scare stories. 'Eight million
face gas price hikes,' screamed the headlines.
Ofgas fought a rearguard action to contain the damage, claiming that the end
of uniform national prices would lead to only minor regional variations. It
also gave assurances that the elderly and disabled would not suffer as a
result of the introduction of competition.
But the government's refusal to make a commitment to include a new Gas Act
in this year's legislative programme merely added to the uncertainty.
To many in the industry it looked as if government ministers had decided
that gas competition was just too risky a project to embark upon so close to
an election.
Many now believe those dark days of summer have passed. In recent months
support for liberalisation has gathered pace.
British Gas now says it welcomes competition, and wants to see a new gas
bill passed this year so that it has maximum freedom to restructure its
businesses.
Consumer associations say that they, too, want competition. Even the
opposition Labour Party has said that it does not want to defend British
Gas's monopoly.
Although the government remains non-committal about whether gas will be
included in the Queen's Speech in mid-November, there is growing confidence
that some form of gas bill or government statement of support may be in the
offing.
But not all of the uncertainties raised during the summer have been swept
away with the change of season. The concerns raised in recent months were
enough to cause the Trade and Industry Select Committee of the House of
Commons to focus its current round of hearings on gas liberalisation.
Many of British Gas's would-be competitors are confident that the hearings
will merely confirm that competition with adequate safeguards is the best
way forward. But there is no certainty that competition will deliver the
substantially lower prices and higher standards of service its proponents
argue are attainable.
Clare Spottiswoode, director general of Ofgas, is optimistic that gas
deregulation will not mean higher prices, as some critics have contended. 'I
don't see that anyone will lose as a result of competition,' she says.
However, she admits that this is a 'leap of faith' on her part because there
is no evidence from other countries to support her view.
Indeed, it is the fact that no other large western industrialised country
has embarked on a similar path which worries some of those charged with
implementing the complex structural and technical changes in the industry
required to make competition work.
British Gas, for example, has asked for at least a six-month delay in the
first phase of competition beginning in 1996. Executives at its TransCo
pipeline subsidiary describe the current timetable as a 'high risk
strategy'. They want more time to ensure that the new market-based
mechanisms to balance the inflow and consumption of gas actually work.
But even though uncertainties persist, the limited competition introduced so
far and the prospect of a much more open market in the future have triggered
dramatic changes within the UK gas industry.
British Gas is undergoing a root-and-branch restructuring, one of the
largest ever attempted in the UK, according to its executives. Within three
years 25,000 jobs, a third of its workforce, will be gone and thousands of
regional and district offices and high street retail shops will be closed.
Senior management has also launched a cultural revolution to turn what has
been one of the UK's most bureaucratic and hierarchical companies into one
which Richard Giordano, chairman, says will be 'more dynamic and
commercially astute'.
Change is also the order of the day for the independent gas marketing
companies which have blossomed in recent years in response to regulatory
actions to promote limited competition in the mainly commercial and
industrial markets.
The independents, with low overheads, have easily undercut prices charged by
British Gas, which until recently was barred by the regulator from offering
discounts. They quickly captured 55 per cent of the mainly commercial market
over 2,500 therms a year.
But during the past year, intense competition has broken out among the
independents, with the result that margins have narrowed dramatically. There
are unlikely to be any early improvements, as Ofgas has recently lifted many
of the temporary restraints it had imposed on British Gas to ensure that
competition took hold.
The harsh operating environment is such that most independents predict it
will lead to a wave of rationalisation over the next two years. Many
independents are subsidiaries of large international oil and gas companies,
and thus should be able to ride out the hard times. Financially weaker
companies may have to merge or seek market niches to survive.
But in spite of the problems and upheavals affecting the industry, there is
a growing belief that competition can be made to work if the final political
go-ahead is given. Ms Spottiswoode is among the optimists.
'When we started work on this we thought there were a lot of contentious
issues. But there are not really that many. The real problem is the
legislative timetable.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: European sector weakens as profit-taking
continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Profit-taking continued to weigh on European government bond markets
yesterday, and dealers said trading would remain range-bound and
directionless until there were new fundamental factors to inspire them.
Prices in Europe opened on a softer tone after US Treasuries had weakened
overnight, and continued to slip throughout the day. However, 'there hasn't
been a lot of selling pressure - we're in a consolidative phase,' said Mr
Paul Campayne, bond strategist at Paribas Capital Markets, adding: 'The
markets moved up sharply in a short period of time, and now they're taking a
breather.'
German government bonds once again set the pace, slipping by nearly 1/2
point after the December bund future breached key technical support at
90.50. It fell as low as 90.20 before closing around 90.42, down 0.40 point
on the day. A break of the next key support level at 90.00 could open the
way to 89.80 or lower, traders said.
'In the last two days, we've lost all the gains seen in the wake of the
German elections,' said Mr Andre de Souza, international bond strategist at
PaineWebber. 'Now we're awaiting M3 for further direction.'
Rumours that September M3 money supply growth, expected to be published late
this week or early next week, would not be as low as expected also made the
market nervous.
After an August growth rate of 8.2 per cent, analysts have been calling for
a September rate between 6.9 per cent and 7.5 per cent. However, talk
yesterday was of a number of about 8 per cent. 'In the wake of these
rumours, a number below 7.5 per cent would probably support bunds,' said a
dealer.
UK gilts shadowed bunds lower yesterday, with profit-taking reinforced by
slightly disappointing retail sales numbers.
'In the pre-auction phase disappointing news is often used as an excuse for
the market to cheapen up,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilt analyst at ABN Amro
Hoare Govett. The Bank of England is due to auction Pounds 2.5bn of 8 per
cent gilts due 2000 next Wednesday.
Dealers reported some shifts by investors into the 10-year sector from the
ultra-long end of the yield curve. Moreover, they said there had been active
two-way dealings in the new gilt which is trading on a when-issued basis.
While Swedish bonds eased in line with most other markets on continued
profit-taking, most traders were looking to today's meeting of the new
Riksbank policy-making council.
'Following the inflation report, the odds have shortened for a tightening at
this meeting,' said Mr de Souza at PaineWebber. On Monday, the central bank
published a report warning of rising inflationary pressures, and market
participants have been gearing up for another interest rate hike in the
coming weeks.
US Treasury bonds gave ground yesterday in the face of a weak dollar and
higher commodity prices.
Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/4 lower at
95 1/2 , with the yield rising to 7.887 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was down  3/32 at 99 23/32 , to yield 6.636 per cent.
The negative tone which had been established the previous session carried
over into yesterday's opening. Bonds across the yield curve were showing
modest losses before the Commerce Department's latest figures on trade.
The report held no big surprises, but bonds failed to respond in kind. The
August deficit in goods and services came in at Dollars 9.74bn, close to
what economists had been forecasting. The figure represented a narrowing of
July's trade gap, revised upward to Dollars 11.19bn.
However, the data itself was less important to the bond market than its
effect on the value of the dollar. Traders were worried that a weaker dollar
would diminish the attraction of US-denominated securities.
In the event, the US currency slipped against the D-Mark and the yen. There
was concern that Japanese imports had reached record levels in August.
A jump in commodity prices was no help to inflation-sensitive bonds, either.
The KR-CRB index rose sharply on higher prices for meat, industrial products
and precious metals.
The late afternoon brought a favourable development, however. Traders were
relieved to learn that the Treasury next week would auction Dollars 11bn in
new five-year notes and Dollars 17.25bn in two-year securities, the normal
size of such issues. Earlier, traders had feared the sale of an extra
Dollars 1bn in five-year notes at a time when the market's ability to absorb
the extra supply was questionable.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Finnish chemicals group
valued at up to FM5bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international offering of shares in Kemira, the state-owned Finnish
chemicals group, is expected to value the company at up to FM5.16bn (Dollars
1bn).
The sale of 25 per cent of shares in the group is expected to raise between
FM1.1bn and FM1.3bn, making it Finland's biggest initial public offering.
Global co-ordinator and book-runner Merrill Lynch reports good interest. It
has two teams marketing the deal to international investors, with final
pricing due in November. Merrill has been involved in Finnish international
equity offers from Outokumpu, the mining and metals group, Valmet, the paper
machinery and engineering group, and Rautaruukki, the steel group, within
the past year.
The group, Finland's eighth largest by sales, will offer 30m shares, at
between FM37 and FM44 each. Postipankki is handling the domestic and Nordic
side, and the US tranche is being handled by Merrill Lynch with Goldman
Sachs, UBS and SG Warburg.
The rest of the world is being handled by Merrill with Indosuez, UBS,
Postipankki, SG Warburg, ABN Amro, Dresdner, Daiwa, James Capel and
Kleinwort Benson.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Spread of Argentina's Dollars 500m
global issue surprises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Argentina launched its long-awaited global eurobond offering
yesterday, with a Dollars 500m issue of five-year fixed-rate bonds.
Syndicate managers expressed surprise at the spread, of 337 1/2 to 350 basis
points over US Treasuries, offered on the bonds. 'Argentina was expected to
come at around 275 to 300 basis points but because of the deal's size and
the difficulty of the markets, it has had to come higher. But even then it
is struggling,' said one syndicate manager.
However, joint lead manager Deutsche Bank said the pricing accurately
reflected demand and current market conditions.
'The pricing is a realistic assessment of how the demand is building. We
tried to match price insensitive retail demand in Europe, for whom the
coupon is more important, and institutional demand in the US which is more
value sensitive,' said a syndicate official at Deutsche Bank.
He said 80 per cent of demand came from retail and institutional investors
in Europe, with the remainder coming from the US.
The bonds, Argentina's first significant dollar issue since December 1993,
will be priced today.
The National Bank of Canada launched a Dollars 200m offering of five-year
floating-rate notes, increased to Dollars 250m because of the huge demand
for the issue.
The bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over three-month Libor.
Fannie Mae, the US mortgage agency, announced its intention to borrow
Dollars 20bn in international markets, launching what it claimed was the
'largest global funded programme in the world'.
Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank is arranging the new facility, with
10 other international banks involved in the marketing and distribution of
the issue.
The association made its debut in global bond markets in June, issuing
Dollars 1.5bn of 10-year global debentures.
Abbey National said that it plans to return to the US market following the
success of its Dollars 500m offering of yankee bonds launched on Tuesday.
Mr Gareth Jones, Abbey National treasurer, said that it would look to do a
global offering of Dollars 1.5bn early next year.
Salomon Brothers was forced to raise the coupon on the Dollars 100m offering
of five-year floating-rate notes launched by Banco di Napoli on Tuesday
after Moody's, the US credit rating agency, downgraded the Italian bank.
A Salomon syndicate official said: 'The market has now stabilised and at
these cheaper levels I think we are going to see more investors coming in to
buy the paper.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Airbus Finance in Dollars 1bn
loan launch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airbus Finance, the sales finance company recently established by Airbus
Industrie, the European aircraft-building consortium, yesterday publicly
launched a Dollars 1bn syndicated loan, its debut transaction.
The seven-year revolving credit facility carries an interest rate of 30
basis points above Libor for the first four years of the loan and 35 basis
points over Libor for the remaining three years.
The loan is guaranteed by Airbus Industrie's four shareholders,
Aerospatiale, Daimler-Benz, British Aerospace and Construcciones
Aeronauticas. Eventually it is hoped that AFC, which will provide finance to
Airbus Industrie's customers for the purchase of aircraft, will become a
separately-rated stand alone company.
The company intends to return to the syndicated loans market and also to
eventually tap the international capital markets, J. P. Morgan said. J. P.
Morgan is AFC's financial adviser and has played a key role in the design of
the loan.
The loan is being placed among selected relationship banks of Airbus
Industrie and banks of Airbus' four shareholders. Banks are being invited to
participate at levels of either Dollars 60m or Dollars 30m with
participation fees of 12.5 basis points or 6.25 basis points respectively.
On the undrawn part of the facility, AFC will pay a commitment fee payable
quarterly in arrears at 12.5 basis points in the first three years and 15
basis points thereafter. Additionally, there will be a fee of 2.5 basis
points per annum if the use of the facility exceeds 50 per cent and a fee of
5 basis points if use exceeds 75 per cent.

black in quarter
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Higher commodity prices and a cost-control programme have allowed MIM
Holdings, the Australian metals producer, to return to the black in the
quarter to September, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
The company yesterday announced it had turned a ADollars 24.7m loss into a
ADollars 16.6m (USDollars 12.20m) profit in the period, on a 28 per cent
increase in sales to ADollars 530.8m from ADollars 413.6m.
Directors said sales volumes for most products, notably copper and zinc,
were up sharply and while prices were higher, they were offset by currency
movements. The company's cost of sales increased 18.5 per cent to ADollars
463.5m.
MIM's asset sale programme had raised ADollars 584m since July last year,
strengthening the group's balance sheet and providing flexibility to fund

The result followed a tax provision of ADollars 12.1m, compared with
ADollars 3.5m, and excluded a net foreign exchange gain of ADollars 1.3m
against ADollars 2.3m. There were no abnormal items, against a ADollars
17.8m loss last time.

Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, the French state-owned insurance group,
achieved net profits of FFr691.5m (Dollars 130.71m) in the first half of the
year, a 14.9 per cent rise over the same period in 1993, writes John Ridding
in Paris.
Mr Pierre Darnis, chairman, said the increase in profits was achieved on
revenues of FFr39.6bn, a rise of 19 per cent over the first six months of
last year.
The insurance group is being prepared for a partial privatisation, which is
expected to take place by the end of the year.
Under the terms of the operation, the government will reduce its 42.5 per
cent direct holding in the company. However, the state will retain control
of the group through indirect investments via the post office and the Caisse
des Depots, the state financial institution.
Observers believe the state will sell about 30 per cent of CNP's capital,
which would bring estimated receipts of about FFr4bn. Analysts have valued
the company as a whole at about FFr12bn.
CNP, which specialises in life insurance products, has enjoyed rapid growth
over recent years, increasing its sales by more than 50 per cent in 1993 to
FFr64.3bn. It achieves most of its sales through post office and savings
bank branches and through tax offices.

<TEXT>
Banco di Napoli, one of Italy's largest banks, has had its credit rating
downgraded by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, because of pressure on
the bank's profitability and 'deteriorating asset quality', writes Andrew
Hill in Milan. Salomon Brothers, the international investment bank, was
yesterday forced to improve the terms of a Dollars 100m issue of Banco di
Napoli five-year floating-rate notes, which it had sold to investors just
before the Moody's announcement on Tuesday night. Salomon, which said it had
no prior warning of the downgrade, also offered to buy back the
floating-rate notes from angry investors.
Moody's downgraded the rating of Banco di Napoli for long-term senior
deposits to Baa1 from A2, and to Baa2 for subordinated deposits, from A3.
The ratings for senior and subordinated debt of the bank and its
subsidiaries were also lowered.
The downgrade comes as a further blow to Banco di Napoli, one of Italy's
longest established banks. Last month, the bank announced disappointing
first-half results, after making heavy provisions against bad loans. Since
then, the bank's share price has declined 17 per cent, although it held firm
yesterday.

Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil group, and Statoil, the
Norwegian state oil company, yesterday announced details of a planned asset
swap programme designed to facilitate a NKr40bn (Dollars 6.1bn) development
of three gas fields in the Norwegian Sea.
The two companies signed a letter of intent covering the complex
arrangement, with the aim of completing a detailed purchase and sales
agreement on November 1.
Saga confirmed it would take over operational responsibility for Statoil's
North Sea Fenris oil field and Statoil would buy 15 per cent of Saga's 50
per cent shareholding in the field, increasing its Fenris stake to 35 per
cent.
The company will take over 10 per cent in two exploration licences in the
Fenris area.
Saga will also acquire from the state a 7 per cent interest in each of the
two licences comprising the Smoerbukk and Smoerbukk South gas fields. This
transaction will need parliamentary approval.
In return, Statoil will acquire two Saga shareholdings, of 5 per cent and
0.625 per cent, in the Norwegian Sea Heidrun oil field. Statoil will also
take over the operation of Saga's Midgard gas field.
Midgard, Smoerbukk and Smoerbukk South are situated in Haltenbanken off the
coast of mid-Norway.
'This is a pioneer agreement which is very important for the two companies .
. . and for the development of Haltenbanken,' said Mr Harald Norvik, chief
executive of Statoil. 'I think we will see more and more of these deals in
future.'
The joint Haltenbanken development will compete with North Sea fields to
supply continental Europe with natural gas.

Gengold, the gold division of South African mining house Gencor, shrugged
off the labour unrest that had dented its previous quarter's figures and
reported a sharp 42.8 per cent rise in after-tax profit for the three months
to September, up to R126.8m (Dollars 36m) from a disappointing R88.8m.
The company's mines benefited from a 4 per cent rise in the average gold
price received and improved overall production. These were more than
sufficient to offset a slight decline in yield.
Overall gold production rose 3.2 per cent to 15,731kg, up from 15,242kg,
while the average gold price received rose to R44,614 a kg from R42,744 a
kg. Total tonnage milled was 2.7m tonnes, up from 2.6m tonnes.
Mr Tom Dale, deputy managing director of Gencor's gold division, said the
company had benefited from the end of election-related unrest in the June
quarter. However, he said working costs were up due to increased mining
activity and a higher wage bill.
Of the group's bigger mines, Beatrix performed best, increasing after-tax
income to R31.3m from R20.7m in spite of a slight drop in yield to 6.1
grammes/tonne from 6.2 grammes/tonne.
Kinross also showed substantial improvement, raising after-tax profits to
R31.1m from R21.5m. Winkelhaak improved its after-tax figures to R21.5m from
R13.6m, while Buffelsfontein's improvement was less dramatic, lifting
profits to R16.3m from R14.5m.
Gold mines in the Anglovaal group increased attributable profit slightly for
the September quarter, raising attributable profit to R46.2m, from R45.3m in
the previous three months.
As usual, the bulk of the profit came from heavyweight producer
Hartebeesfontein, which, in spite of lower yields, achieved managed to raise
after-tax to R42.1m from R40.4m.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: UBS rejects Ebner plan in proxy
battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Union Bank of Switzerland yesterday rejected Mr Martin Ebner's proposal that
a director be appointed specifically to represent the bank's registered
shareholders.
Pursuing its proxy battle with the maverick Zurich banker, the bank
discounted Mr Ebner's warning that the bank could come under the control of
drug barons or other undesirable groups once voting restrictions had been
removed from its shares.
The UBS board last month proposed splitting its registered shares and bearer
shares into a new class of bearer shares with equal voting power and no
voting restrictions. An extraordinary general meeting will be held on
November 22 to vote on the proposal.
The board made clear that its purpose was to remove the disproportionate
voting power held by the registered shares. These shares have 51.1 per cent
of all votes and can be voted only by Swiss nationals, but they represent
only 17.3 per cent of the bank's capital.
Mr Ebner is chairman of BK Vision, an investment fund that is UBS's largest
shareholder with an 18 per cent holding in the registered shares. He has
said he is trying to rally the support of other shareholders to vote for
changes in the bank's strategy at the annual meeting next spring.
Mr Nikolaus Senn, chairman, said the nomination of a board member to
represent the registered shareholders would be superfluous if, as he
expected, shareholders approved the board's motion.
He said a Swiss banking law coming into effect at the beginning of the year
would provide greater safeguards against undesirable takeovers than the
registered shares.
Mr Robert Studer, UBS chief executive, explained the bank's rejection of Mr
Ebner's call for it to focus more on investment and private banking. He said
the bank's strategy of underpinning its wholesale financial activities with
a strong Swiss retail base ensured a more stable earnings performance and a
higher share rating than those of US and UK banks.
Mr Studer dismissed calls for compensation to registered shareholders for
the loss in value of their shares because it could only come unfairly at the
expense of the bearer shareholders.
Analysts advised against buying the registered shares in recent months
because of the abnormal premium they acquired. 'Those who bought despite
this advice did so at their own risk,' Mr Studer said.
Mr Senn acknowledged that BK Vision had opportunities to challenge the
legality of the November vote. UBS has said its motion requires acceptance
by two-thirds of the shares present and a majority of the capital.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kodak unravels a multi-billion
dollar web - Derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Paying off Dollars 5bn of debt and retiring Dollars 7bn worth of swaps and
options must rank as one of the biggest balance sheet restructuring
operations. For Eastman Kodak, which is undertaking the process, the result
is likely to be a charge to earnings that runs into the hundreds of millions
of dollars - though its derivatives strategy has cut the company's borrowing
costs over a number of years.
Kodak took on the debt in 1988 to finance its purchase of Sterling, a drugs
company. On top of this debt - a mixture of fixed-rate and zero-coupon
bonds, much of it callable - the US photographic products company layered an
array of interest rate and currency swaps, along with interest options. Its
overall aim at the time was to restructure the debts, in part to take
advantage of arbitrage opportunities between the corporate debt and
derivative markets.
'There were two objectives - one was to reduce borrowing costs, the other
was to receive cash,' says Mr Jesse Greene, Kodak's current treasurer.
One arbitrage exploited by Kodak in the late 1980s, for example, involved
the use of callable debt linked with options to create synthetic fixed-rate
debt. The company issued callable bonds, then sold call options in the
market to receive an immediate cash premium.
If interest rates fell, Kodak could pay off the bonds at the call date - but
at the same time, the buyer of the option could exercise its own call on
Kodak. The effect for the company was indistinguishable from issuing
straight fixed-rate debt at the outset, except that it received premium
income on the option. This arbitrage strategy is thought to have saved the
company 10-15 basis points on its borrowing costs.
As a result, about Dollars 2.8bn of the Dollars 7.5bn notional value of
Kodak's derivative instruments at the end of last year comprised options
linked to callable debt.
Elsewhere, Kodak had taken advantage of a variety of arbitrages to reduce
its borrowing costs. It had, for example, swapped Dollars 135m of fixed rate
dollar bonds into yen-denominated instruments, and Dollars 46m into D-Marks,
in both cases to reduce its costs.
The overall holdings of derivatives to which this sort of opportunistic debt
management policy gives rise can look like a grab-bag. That the notional
value of the instruments - at Dollars 7bn - is higher than the value of the
debt, and the mix of instruments is so broad, testifies to the layering of
different approaches over time.
Such an approach to debt management is common among big companies with
sophisticated treasury operations, says Mr Irving Wilson, a managing
director at CS Financial Products who has worked on balance sheet
restructuring.
According to Kodak and CS Financial Products and Lehman Brothers, its
advisers, unwinding the derivatives positions has been relatively straight
forward and not resulted in unusual costs: swaps have been in the liquid US
dollar, yen and D-Mark markets making it easy to reverse trades without
affecting overall market spreads. Mr Greene says in most cases the unwinding
was done with the original counterparties to the instruments, though the
company accepted outside bids for parts of the portfolio.
For Kodak shareholders, there will be one simple way to assess how
successful Kodak has been with the programme.
In its quarterly reports for the end of June, Kodak revealed that its
long-term borrowings had a fair value that was about Dollars 241m above the
value at which they were recorded in the company's accounts (since the debt
was issued at a time when interest rates were higher than at present, Kodak
would in theory have to pay this amount to buy the debt back). Its swaps and
options, meanwhile, were showing a fair value some Dollars 370m below the
level at which they were recorded.
The message: the whole debt-retirement package would have cost Dollars 611m
at that time - that was at least an advance on the end of 1993, when lower
prevailing interest rates meant the cost to the company of retiring the debt
would have been nearly Dollars 1.2bn.
Kodak has reported pre-tax costs of Dollars 162m from unwinding its various
positions. Bond yields have risen slightly from their June levels, bringing
down the cost of the programme. However, the message from quarterly report
is that there are several hundred million dollars worth of charges still to
come.

Australian drought

Widespread drought cut net profit of Incitec, the Australian fertiliser and
chemicals group, by 7 per cent to ADollars 29.6m from ADollars 31.8m in the
year to September, writes Bruce Jacques.
Directors said second-half earnings were particularly hit by drought which
eroded margins in the fertiliser business. But this was partially offset by
expansion in the industrial chemicals business.
The directors expected tight conditions to continue but have declared a
special dividend of 28 cents a share to pass franking tax credits to
shareholders.
The ordinary dividend has been reduced to 20 cents a share from 23 cents.
The result followed a 5.2 per cent sales increase to ADollars 675m. Tax
provisions took ADollars 16.3m compared with ADollars 12.4m, and
depreciation ADollars 22.9m against ADollars 24.8m. Interest expense took
ADollars 5.4m against ADollars 6.9m.

<TEXT>
Shares in Indosat, the Indonesian state-owned satellite telecommunications
company, made their debut on the Jakarta Stock Exchange yesterday after a
listing of American Depositary Shares in New York earlier this week.
Indosat shares ended the day in Jakarta at Rp8,475, up from the initial
price of Rp7,000.
ADSs, equal to 10 Indosat shares, were trading at Dollars 38.25 around
midday yesterday, up Dollars 1.12 on the day and up from the initial price
of Dollars 32.05.
Some brokers claimed the unexpectedly high opening price on the Jakarta
exchange was orchestrated to stimulate domestic demand.
'The first trade was a well-rehearsed transaction,' said Mr Andrew Vaughn,
head of research at GK Goh Ometraco in Jakarta.
However, the fact that investors were prepared to pay almost 20 per cent
more than the initial public offering price in both cities is a sign of
confidence in the company's future.
Brokers say Indosat is one of Asia's most profitable companies. It employs
about 1,600 people and recorded net profits of Rp237bn (Dollars 109m) in
1992 against Rp208.5bn in 1991.
Indonesia is expected to invest about Dollars 10bn by the year 2000 in
expanding telecommunications across its archipelago of more than 13,000
islands.
Indosat raised about Dollars 1bn in its New York float, or 25 per cent of
the company's stock. It listed 10 per cent of its stock in Jakarta. A report
on the initial public offering of the shares in Jakarta is expected to show
that the shares were more than twice subscribed.
American Depositary Receipts of Philippine Long Distance Telephone, the
Philippines' biggest telecommunications company, were listed yesterday in
New York and on the Pacific stock exchange in the US, writes Jose Galang in
Manila.
Each of the ADRs represents one share of common stock. A total of 22m ADRs
were listed at an opening price of Dollars 59.50 each, corresponding to the
common stock's closing price on October 18.
Citibank, which packaged the programme, said holders of the stock would be
entitled to exchange without charge their shares for the corresponding
amount of ADRs. Citibank will also provide depositary facilities for the
ADRs and will act as custodian bank in Manila for the PLDT shares.
PLDT said its common stock 'will benefit from the increased visibility and
liquidity afforded by the NYSE listing'. Trading in PLDT common shares in
the US will be suspended.

Cummins, the Indiana-based diesel engine maker, yesterday said third-quarter
income rose to Dollars 61.9m, or Dollars 1.48 a share, from last year's
Dollars 40.7m, or Dollars 1.11.
Sales for the quarter were a record Dollars 1.2bn, up from Dollars 988.3m in
last year's third quarter.
Strong sales in US medium-duty and heavy-duty truck markets lifted results.
The company said it expected North American heavy-duty truck production to
reach a record 205,000 units in 1994, up 20 per cent over 1993.
Cummins has 34 per cent of that market, and 35 per cent of the North
American medium-duty truck market.
Its power generation group recorded sales of Dollars 249m in the quarter.
The company recently acquired Power Group International, based in the UK,
whose businesses are less cyclical than those of Cummins' other business
segments.
For the first nine months earnings rose to Dollars 182.7m, or Dollars 4.43,
on sales of Dollars 3.5bn, against Dollars 130.0m, or Dollars 3.54, on sales
of Dollars 3.1bn last time.

<TEXT>
BankAmerica, the second largest bank in the US, yesterday reported a 13 per
cent improvement in third-quarter earnings to Dollars 547m, or Dollars 1.36
a share.
The results, lifted by the contribution of the Chicago-based Continental
Bank, which BankAmerica acquired earlier this year for Dollars 1.9bn, were
in line with analysts' estimates.
BankAmerica said the addition of Continental's businesses had given it
improved access to US wholesale customers, especially in the Midwest, where
it has set up a new subsidiary and relocated its corporate banking
operation.
Net interest income rose to Dollars 1.9bn in the latest quarter from Dollars
1.88bn a year ago.
However, without Continental's Dollars 40m contribution, net interest income
would have fallen slightly in the quarter as an increase in loans failed to
offset a fall in the bank's net interest margin from 4.72 per cent to 4.51
per cent.
Credit quality improved in the period, with BankAmerica having to set aside
only Dollars 110m as a provision for loan losses in the quarter, compared
with Dollars 178m a year earlier.
Non-interest income, meanwhile, increased Dollars 68m to just under Dollars
1.1bn, with just over half of the improvement derived from Continental.

<TEXT>
WMX Technologies, the international waste haulier and processor, reported
third-quarter income of Dollars 212.8m, or 44 cents a share, up from a loss
of Dollars 127.1m, or 26 cents, in the same 1993 quarter.
The 1993 third-quarter loss was the result of a Dollars 285m charge for a
restructuring at WMX's struggling Chemical Waste Management subsidiary.
WMX's third-quarter sales were Dollars 2.6bn, up from Dollars 2.3bn a year
earlier.
WMX is also the majority owner of WMX International, Rust International and
Wheelabrator Technologies. Chemical Waste this week reported that it earned
Dollars 15m, or 7 cents a share, in the third quarter, recovering from last
year's third-quarter loss of Dollars 359.9m, or Dollars 1.72. Excluding
special charges, Chemical Waste earned 4 cents a share in the 1993 third
quarter.
WMX said Chemical Waste still suffered from low volumes in its core
hazardous waste businesses. In June, state regulators sharply restricted the
use of the company's Barnwell, South Carolina, low-level radioactive waste
processing facilities, dampening earnings prospects.
WMX last week agreed to buy back the 45m shares, or about 21 per cent, of
Chemical Waste that it does not already own for Dollars 8.85 a share,
substantially above an initial offer of Dollars 7.86 made in July.
For the first nine months of the year, WMX earned Dollars 578.6m, or Dollars
1.20, on sales of Dollars 7.4bn. That is up from Dollars 289.8m, or 60
cents, on sales of Dollars 6.7bn in the same 1993 period.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Airline shares up as AMR beats
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in US airlines jumped sharply yesterday after AMR, American Airlines'
parent and the first US airline to report its quarterly results this season,
produced profits well in excess of analysts' expectations.
Net earnings after preferred stock dividends shot up to Dollars 188m from
Dollars 102m in the quarter to September, and fully-diluted earnings per
share rose to Dollars 2.27 from Dollars 1.34. Analysts had been predicting
earnings per share of Dollars 1.75 to Dollars 2.00.
It was the airline's best result in five years. Later, Mr Michael Durham,
AMR's chief financial officer, warned analysts that a restructuring charge
could reduce net profits to around break-even in the fourth quarter, but
AMR's shares still closed Dollars 1 7/8 up at Dollars 53 7/8 . UAL rose
Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 90 1/8 and Delta Air Lines rose Dollars 1 1/2 to
Dollars 47 1/8 .
Although some of AMR's other activities improved their performance, most of
the profits growth came from the passenger airline operation. Revenues were
down because an increase in passenger numbers was outweighed by a decrease
in the average fare paid, but profits grew because American Airlines cut
capacity by 5 per cent, so increasing load factors.
American Airlines has been cutting costs by dropping unprofitable routes,
reducing its fleet and shedding jobs. In the latest quarter, group operating
expenses fell 2.2 per cent to Dollars 3.74bn, partly because jet fuel costs
were 3.2 per cent lower. AMR said employee costs continued to rise.
One drawback to the profits improvement is that it will make it harder for
AMR to persuade its labour unions of the need to accept higher productivity
and pay cuts. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman, warned that low-cost carriers
now accounted for almost 40 per cent of the company's domestic routes, and
the figure was rapidly growing.
Mr Crandall said: 'In light of our earnings, some may ask if the company
still needs to change. The answer is that it clearly does.'
In the last few weeks American Airlines has announced plans for cuts in jobs
at its headquarters and the contracting-out of jobs among airport ground
staff. The fourth-quarter restructuring charge is believed to relate to
these cuts.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Volume grows at US telecom
groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Third-quarter results from several US telecom-munications companies showed
continued fast growth in the volume of traffic, but also bore the scars of
increased competition.
Bell Atlantic reported a 58 per cent rise in the number of its cellular
phone customers and a 9 per cent increase in minutes of use on its local
networks.
However, the Philadelphia-based company suffered a loss of Dollars 1.87bn in
the quarter after previously announced extraordinary charges of Dollars
2.15bn, incurred in what Mr Raymond Smith, chairman, called 'an aggressive,
multi-year campaign to respond to competition in our traditional markets'.
Underlying net earnings for the quarter were down 29 per cent at Dollars
276m.
Pacific Telesis announced a 6.7 per cent rise in minutes of use, but flat
revenues and a 2 per cent rise in net earnings for the quarter, to Dollars
314m.
The San Francisco-based company warned that it would be difficult to achieve
earnings growth next year, as a result of 'regulatory rulings, increased
competition and strategic initiatives'.
Mr Phil Quigley, chairman, said 'a price cap on call charges which is being
introduced next year as part of California's new regulatory framework would
cut revenues by around Dollars 196m, with an initial Dollars 45m impact on
this year's results'.
In addition, the company will drop its local toll charges by 40 per cent
from the start of next year, when new competitors will be allowed into its
market.
GTE, the biggest US local phone company, said its cellular customers rose by
48 per cent and minutes of use in its local networks by 9.6 per cent.
These factors 'more than offset lower, more competitive telephone pricing,'
the company said.
Operating profits were up 8 per cent at a record Dollars 1.25bn for the
quarter, while earnings per share before special items were also up 8 per
cent at 64 cents.
MCI Communications, the second largest US long-distance telephone company,
in which the UK telecommunications company BT has a 20 per cent stake, said
its third-quarter earnings showed an underlying increase of 15 per cent to
Dollars 220m, or 38 cents a share, on sales up 12 per cent at Dollars
3.41bn.
Traffic grew 10.2 per cent over the year, while international business was
up more than 20 per cent.
MCI also reported strong growth in the use of toll-free 800 numbers in the
US. Sales in the 800 business market grew almost 20 per cent, while MCI's
1-800-COLLECT consumer service, introduced last year, had doubled its number
of calls since the start of the year.
MCI's newest 800 product, an international directory enquiries service
launched earlier this month under the name of 1-800-CALL-INFO, came under
fire yesterday from AT&amp;T, MCI's bigger rival.
In a formal complaint to the US Federal Communications Commission, AT&amp;T said
the service was illegal because it charged customers for a call to an 800
number. MCI denied the service was illegal.
Ameritech, the mid-western local telephone company, announced a 15 per cent
rise in net earnings before one-time charges to Dollars 419m in the third
quarter, with cellular customers up 51 per cent and minutes of use up 8.0
per cent. However, it also took a net charge of Dollars 168m to cover a
further 4,000 job losses, on top of the 6,000 announced in March. Revenues
in the quarter rose 5.9 per cent to Dollars 3.12bn.

<TEXT>
Compaq Computer lived up to high expectations with an 88 per cent jump in
net income for the third quarter, achieved on a sales increase of 63 per
cent.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 201m, up from Dollars 107m in the
third quarter of 1993. Earnings per share rose 79 per cent to 75 cents,
compared with 42 cents in the same period last year. Revenues increased to
Dollars 2.84bn from Dollars 1.75bn.
Sales growth was strong worldwide, the company said. North American sales
grew by 57 per cent, Europe by 50 per cent and Japan, Latin America and
Asia-Pacific sales grew at a combined rate of 122 per cent.
More than half of Compaq's sales are in North America.
During the quarter, Compaq continued its expansion by beginning production
at new facilities in Jaguarina, Brazil, and Shenzhen, China. This week the
company announced plans to establish a sales and marketing subsidiary in
South Africa.
Third-quarter gross margin declined to 23 per cent from 26.5 per cent in the
second quarter, but the drop was anticipated due to aggressive price cuts.
Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief executive, said he expected to
maintain this level of profit margins for the remainder of the year and
1995.
He has set a target for Compaq to be the worldwide PC industry leader by
1996. By most measures, however, this goal has already been achieved with
Compaq outselling its largest competitors, IBM and Apple Computer, for the
year to date.
Mr Gian Carlo Bison, senior vice-president for North American marketing,
declined to comment on a legal dispute between Intel and Advanced Micro
Devices, Compaq's two suppliers of microprocessor chips, that threatens to
interrupt AMD's production. He said, however, that Compaq was talking to 'a
variety of potential suppliers' of microprocessors.
For the year to date, net income rose to Dollars 624m, or Dollars 3.11,
against Dollars 311m, or Dollars 1.22. Revenues advanced to Dollars 7.6bn
from Dollars 5bn in the first nine months of 1993.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Monsanto hit by higher costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A rise of almost 20 per cent in raw material costs contributed to a 14 per
cent drop in operating income at Monsanto, the US chemicals group, in the
third quarter.
Other factors were lower margins in Roundup herbicide, lower bulk prices for
the artificial sweetener aspartame (NutraSweet) and the absence of income
from discontinued businesses. However, the company was on its way to 'an
outstanding 1994', Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman, said.
Worldwide sales of Roundup were well ahead in the quarter, though a tilt in
volume towards lower-margin markets as a result of weather conditions had
reduced profits. Operating profits in pharmaceuticals were maintained on a 4
per cent rise in sales.
Sales of the controversial substance BST (bovine somatotropin), used to
increase milk yields, were well ahead of expectations, the company said.
Introduced to the US market early this year, Posilac - Monsanto's version of
BST - had got off to 'a very good start', a spokesman said.
Net earnings for the quarter, helped by a Dollars 21m tax settlement, were
up 22 per cent at Dollars 116m, or 99 cents a share.
Full-year net earnings from Rohm and Haas, the speciality chemicals
producer, should beat their previous record of Dollars 230m set in 1988, Mr
Lawrence Wilson, chairman, said yesterday. Net earnings in the third quarter
were Dollars 55m, compared with a loss of Dollars 23m, bringing the
nine-month total to Dollars 211m.

decline on European operations

<TEXT>
Lotus Development has reported a sharp drop in earnings for the third
quarter. The US personal computer software company blamed problems in its
European operations for the reversal.
Net income before non-recurring charges was Dollars 7.3m, or 15 cents a
share, 60 per cent down on Dollars 18.3m, or 41 cents, in the same period
last year. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 235.2m, a 2 per cent decline
from Dollars 240.1m in last year's third quarter.
Lotus took charges of Dollars 67.9m for the acquisition of SoftSwitch and
Edge Research, two software development groups, during the quarter. The
company also took a Dollars 9m charge for restructuring its European
operations. The net loss for the quarter, after charges, was Dollars 66.4m,
or Dollars 1.39 a share.
'Third-quarter results proved disappointing, primarily due to poor
performance of our European operations,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and
chief executive officer. He also cited slower than expected sales through a
volume purchase programme for corporate customers.
The problems in Europe stemmed from slow demand for Lotus' office PC
applications programs and a management shuffle, said Mr Edwin Gillis, chief
financial officer. During the period Lotus appointed a new manager of its
European operations and cut about 90 jobs, he added. New products, launched
in September, were expected to boost demand, he said.
Revenues from communications programs, used for electronic messaging, now
account for about one-third of revenues and sales of these products grew 72
per cent, year on year.
Net losses, after charges, for the year to date were Dollars 35.3m, or 76
cents a share, compared with net income after charges of Dollars 25.9m, or
59 cents, in the first nine months of 1993.

<TEXT>
Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US healthcare group that has recently agreed to buy
Eastman Kodak's diagnostic products division and the Neutrogena skin care
company, saw a 16 per cent increase in net profits in the third quarter in
spite of a big increase in its tax charge.
The profits growth was led by the group's pharmaceuticals division, which
increased sales by 21 per cent in the US and internationally because of
strong performances from new drugs, such as Risperdal, an anti-psychotic
medication for schizophrenia. The division had sales of Dollars 1.3bn.
The consumer division saw a 22 per cent increase in international sales,
mainly because of a strong performance from its operations in Brazil where
the local economy is recovering. Domestic growth was softer at 5 per cent,
leaving total sales 13 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.4bn.
The professional division, driven by rapid international growth, increased
sales by 12 per cent to Dollars 1.3bn.
Overall, group sales rose by 15 per cent to Dollars 4.04bn, of which 2
percentage points were attributable to the recent weakness of the dollar
against other currencies.
International sales advanced by 22 per cent - much faster than domestic
sales, which rose by 9 per cent.
Pre-tax profits rose by 22.5 per cent, but after the increase in the tax
charge, earnings per share were 17 per cent ahead at 82 cents.

Amgen, the California-based biotechnology company, reported strong sales
growth in its two main products in the third quarter, leading to a 23 per
cent rise in underlying earnings to Dollars 114m.
Sales of Epogen, for kidney failure, rose 25 per cent, and of Neupogen, used
to boost the immune system, 15 per cent.
Group sales were 20 per cent ahead at Dollars 426m. Amgen said sales of
Neupogen in the US were up 11 per cent at Dollars 215m, and international
sales up 29 per cent at Dollars 55m. Epogen sales totalled Dollars 187m.
Earnings per share for the quarter were 82 cents, compared with an adjusted
65 cents last year.
Mr Gordon Binder, chairman, said: 'I am confident that the strong patient
benefits of Epogen and Neupogen will enable us to achieve double-digit sales
and earnings growth in 1995 and that these breakthrough products, as well as
others being explored through in-house discovery and external collaboration,
will continue to fuel growth in later years.'
Amgen said that during the quarter it made a preliminary submission to the
US authorities for a new drug, neuro-trophin-3, developed in partnership
with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.
The drug treats peripheral neuropathes, found in patients undergoing cancer
therapy and in diabetics.

British Telecom has combined with four North American organisations to
operate the first commercial transatlantic fibre-optic video service for
broadcasters and production houses.
The new company, Atlantic-Vision, will operate its service, using the
recently completed cable, from early next year. A service is already
available using satellite.
When fully operational AtlanticVision will compete with satellite
transmission of pictures across the Atlantic by professional users.
The Vyvx, a subsidiary of WilTel, the US tele-communications company, and BT
have entered an agreement with Teleglobe Canada, the international
telecommunications group, to provide the television transmission links
between the UK and the US.
Links between the UK and Canada will be provided under a separate agreement
between Stentor, an alliance of Canada's leading telephone companies, BT and
Teleglobe.
Charges will be Dollars 600 for 15 minutes and the new organisation claims
that the undersea network will offer 'the fastest and most cost-effective
secure link between North America and northern and eastern Europe'.

Genentech, the US bio-technology company, bucked the trend of bad news from
its sector with a 116 per cent rise in net income in the third quarter to
Dollars 33.6m, or 28 cents a share.
The company attributed much of the growth to its latest product, Pulmozyne,
which treats cystic fibrosis.
On Monday, shares in two smaller biotech companies, Gensia Pharmaceuticals
and ProCyte, more than halved on the news that new products had failed in
clinical trials. However, Mr Kirk Raab, Genentech chairman, said: 'Important
clinical development progress during the quarter should help us maintain our
rate of growth.'
The company said sales of Pulmozyne, in its third quarter on the market, had
been Dollars 21m, compared with Dollars 18.7m in the second quarter. The
drug was launched in France and Germany in the quarter, and sells in 18
countries.
Sales of Activase, used to dissolve blood clots, were Dollars 65.1m, against
Dollars 63.5m. However, sales of Genentech's two human growth hormone
products, Protropin and Nutropin, were down to Dollars 54.6m from Dollars
55.4m.
Group revenues in the quarter were Dollars 193.8m, an increase of 17 per
cent. Research and development expenditure was Dollars 73.2m, against
Dollars 72.3m, or 38 per cent of revenue.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Solid advance at Metsa-Serla
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Metsa-Serla, the Finnish forestry group, said yesterday its profits after
financial items had more than trebled in the first eight months of the year,
to FM382m (Dollars 82.7m) from FM124m in spite of flat sales and a drop in
operating profits.
The rise in earnings stemmed from a steep fall in net financial expenses, to
FM153m from FM504m, as interest charges tumbled and the group made a net
exchange rate gain of FM68m.
However, Metsa said an upswing in the forestry industry that began at the
beginning of the year had gathered strength during the summer. It said
demand and prices were rising and that profitability would be stronger in
the last four months of the year. It forecast full-year profits at least
double 1993's FM303m.
In the first eight months, sales reached FM6bn, virtually unchanged from a
year ago. An increase in expenses and losses from associated companies
pushed down operating profit, to FM535m from FM628m.
In the three main business areas - encompassing paper, paperboard,
corrugated board, tissue and chemicals - both sales and operating profits
were down. Sales of sawn goods and pulp, however, rose to FM1.55bn from
FM1.32bn, while operating profit rose to FM282m from FM137m.
Metsa said it would spend more than FM700m on new investments over the year.
It has a 28 per cent stake in a 500,000 tonnes-per-annum pulp mill being
built at Rauma in Finland, and is expanding a sawmill at Kyro which will
raise Metsa's sawn goods capacity to 130,000 cubic metres a year by the end
of next March.
The group said it had taken an extraordinary charge of FM44m in the
eight-month accounts to cover its share of a fine for price fixing imposed
in July by the European Union on European board manufacturers.

Neste, the state-owned Finnish oil and petrochemicals group, yesterday
confirmed a strong return to profitability this year with figures showing a
swing to a pre-tax profit of FM879m (Dollars 190m) in the first eight months
of the year from a loss of FM1.3bn in the same period last year.
Sales were down sharply at FM32.96bn from FM42.8bn, due in part to lower
crude oil prices. However, operating profit jumped to FM1.5bn from FM454m,
and Neste said it expected profitability to be sustained at the same levels
during the rest of the year.
The turnround - and much of the fall in sales - was attributed to the
effects of a broad restructuring programme designed to return Neste to
profit, and prepare the 97-per cent state-owned group for a partial
privatisation.
Part of the fall in sales was blamed on the merger in spring of Neste's
petrochemicals and polyolefins operations in a 50-50 joint venture with
Norway's Statoil. The merged company is called Borealis. Neste has also
reduced operations in its main trading division, which saw sales in the
first eight months fall to FM17bn from FM24bn.
Neste says it will concentrate its activities on oil and energy. It has set
up a separate natural gas subsidiary called Gasum in which Gazprom, the
Russian monopoly gas company, has a 25 per cent stake. It also this year
sold its 24 per cent stake in the Swedish refiner OK Petroleum.

Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals group, plans to sell its acetics
business as part of a strategy to get out of making intermediate and basic
chemicals.
Rhone-Poulenc management has convened a meeting for October 27 at the works
council at the group's Pardies acetics plant in south-west France to explain
the move. An announcement will be made later that day.
The group gave no further details, except to confirm the impending sale was
in line with the intention of Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, president, to sell
Dollars 1bn-Dollars 1.5bn in assets over the next 18 months. These would be
chiefly in intermediate or basic chemicals for which his group had no
in-house use or where the scale of its activity was dwarfed by that of
others.
Acetics form part of Rhone-Poulenc's organic and inorganic intermediates
division, which last year recorded sales of FFr14.1bn (Dollars 266m). It is
estimated that acetics accounted for just over FFr2bn of this.
According to one report in Paris, Union Carbide of the US might be
interested in buying the unit from Rhone-Poulenc.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Five-fold surge in profit at
Nokia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Nokia, Europe's biggest manufacturer of mobile telephones, yesterday
announced a near five-fold increase in profits in the first eight months of
the year as its spectacular growth continued.
The Finnish group reported pre-tax profits during the period of FM2.29bn
(Dollars 494.9m), up from FM466m at the same stage last year. Net sales rose
to FM18.2bn from FM14.1bn, but Nokia said this represented a 40 per cent
increase in turnover when exchange rates and restructuring were taken into
account.
The result, driven by fast-growing demand for Nokia's telecommunications
network equipment and its mobile handsets, was ahead of most expectations.
Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive, said the outlook for the rest of the year
was also favourable. Nokia's ordinary shares jumped 5 per cent on the
Helsinki stock exchange to close at FM632 after starting the day at FM600.
Sales of mobile telephones surged 64 per cent, underscoring Nokia's position
as the world's second largest manufacturer of mobiles after Motorola of the
US. The mobile division's sales reached FM5.03bn in the first eight months,
compared with FM3.68bn in the same period last year.
Turnover in the telecommunications division, meanwhile, jumped by more than
50 per cent to FM4.22bn from FM2.74bn. Nokia said growth was strongest in
Europe - mainly in Germany and the UK - and in the Asia-Pacific region.
Mr Ollila said he anticipated the world market for mobile telephones would
continue to show volume growth of between 50 and 80 per cent for at least
the next two years. 'We are concerned that strong growth like that can have
its problems - the organisation can become very stretched. But we are not
taking every contract; we are very careful that we can deliver what we have
promised,' he said.
Since taking over at Nokia two years ago, Mr Ollila has focused the group,
once a sprawling industrial conglomerate, on telecommunications. A problem
continues to be its lossmaking consumer and industrial electronics division,
which saw sales fall in the period to FM4.1bn and which returned a further
loss. (Nokia does not give details of divisional profits in interim
results.)
Mr Ollila said the division should return to profit in the last four months.
He intended to keep it within the group, partly to help Nokia explore
opportunities in multimedia products.
However, Nokia announced it was considering floating off most of its 80 per
cent holding in Nokia Tyres on the Helsinki stock exchange. The company is
also 20 per cent-owned by SP Tyres UK, part of the Sumitomo Group. It had
net sales in 1993 of FM862m.
Nokia said it would invest FM310m in expanding production facilities in
Finland.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Accor sees first-half tumble
into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Accor, the French hotels and travel service group, said yesterday that it
would report a loss for the first half of the year, compared with a net
profit of FFr109m (Dollars 20.60m) in the same period in 1993.
The company declined to comment on the size of the loss ahead of an official
announcement next week. It said, however, the deficit reflected the lack of
exceptional gains on the disposal of assets which have boosted profits in
previous years.
Accor said the first-half performance would be affected by the seasonal
nature of the hotels business. However, the economic recovery in some of its
principal European markets was expected to have a positive impact in the
second half of the year.
Industry analysts said they were not surprised by the prospect of the loss.
'Since it became apparent that there would be no exceptional gains, the
announcement is not a shock,' said Mr Herve Guez, an analyst at Smith New
Court. Another hotels analyst said a poor operating result would fuel
concerns about the group's recovery prospects.
The forecast loss is the latest step in a results decline at the hotels
group which has seen profits fall from FFr802m in 1992.
The company has been hit by the impact of recession in its principal markets
and has little exposure to the UK, where recovery has come earlier than on
the continent.
Profits have also been hit by a heavy debt burden which totalled about
FFr13.3bn at the end of last year, excluding the debts of Motel 6, the US
chain in which Accor has a controlling 39.5 per cent stake.
The high level of debts, partly due to the company's 1991 acquisition of
Wagons-Lits of Belgium, have prompted a programme of asset disposals.

FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: KOP seeks to strengthen capital
base by FM3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<DATELINE>
   HELSINKI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, said yesterday it
wanted to strengthen its capital base by FM3bn (Dollars 648.4m). The move is
a final attempt to shake off the legacy of the country's banking sector
crisis, which has brought the bank four years of losses.
It intends to launch a FM2bn share issue - its third big equity offering in
the past two years - and raise a further FM1bn in capital gains from asset
sales.
Part of the aim is to support an expected growth in lending as the Finnish
economy recovers.
However, the issue will also restore the bank's distributable equity and
allow it to pay interest on FM1.75bn of preferred capital certificates held
by the state. Otherwise, the government has the option to convert the
certificates into shares, increasing its stake in the bank from 15 to 36 per
cent.
The share issue, at FM6.40 a share, will lift the bank's capital adequacy
ratio above 11 per cent from 9.2 per cent. It is being informally guaranteed
by Repola and Pohjola, KOP's leading shareholders who have said they will
subscribe for at least FM1bn of the offer.
'This share issue is the culmination of our capitalisation programme,' said
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, KOP chief executive. He said there would also be a
further effort to squeeze costs to cut annual operating expenses by FM300m.
The capital-raising programme follows a worsening of the bank's performance
in the first eight months of the year, when operating losses rose to FM1.3bn
from FM896m in the same 1993 period. Cumulative losses over the 1991-1994
period exceed FM9bn.
The bank said its figures had deteriorated in the second four months because
of losses linked to the construction group Puolimatka.
A charge of FM800m against Puolimatka was the main item in a total bad debt
charge of FM1.67bn, compared with FM1.96bn in the same 1993 period. However,
this year's figure was struck after full utilisation of a FM900m provision
in the 1993 accounts for future write-offs.
The bank's figures were also hit by FM160m in bond losses, compared with
gains of FM340m in the same 1993 period. This lowered net income from
financial operations by 7 per cent to FM1.48bn.
KOP says expected net operating losses of between FM400m and FM500m in the
final four months should largely be offset by realised and unrealised
investment gains. It still hopes to make a profit next year, although it
expects to remain in the red for the first few months.

<TEXT>
Matsushita, the Japanese electronics group, yesterday affirmed its
determination to retain control of MCA, its Los Angeles-based entertainment
business, in spite of demands from MCA's senior management to take control
of the company.
Mr Yoichi Morishita, chairman of Matsushita, held five hours of talks in San
Francisco on Tuesday with Mr Lew Wasserman, veteran MCA chairman, and Mr
Sidney Sheinberg, president.
The US duo, the longest established management team in Hollywood, tabled a
request for managerial control. Mr Morishita rejected the request by telling
them: 'As long as Matsushita holds 100 per cent of the shares we can not
cede control.'
The San Francisco showdown followed months of strained relations between MCA
and its Japanese parent company. Mr Wasserman and Mr Sheinberg have
criticised Matsushita for allegedly blocking their plans to expand MCA's
entertainment interests at the same aggressive pace as rivals such as Time
Warner and Viacom.
Tuesday's meeting followed a few days after the news that Mr David Geffen,
the billionaire music mogul who founded MCA's Geffen Record subsidiary, and
Mr Steven Spielberg, the director of its latest box office hits, Jurassic
Park and Schindler's List, were joining forces with Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg,
former head of Walt Disney's film studios, to form an entertainment company.
The potential loss of Mr Geffen and Mr Spielberg has intensified the
pressure on MCA and Matsushita to resolve the US company's future.
However, some US entertainment industry analysts speculated that Mr
Wasserman, 81, and Mr Sheinberg, 59, may have over-played their hand by
giving Matsushita the chance to replace them with a younger management team.

Alcatel, the French tele-communications company, yesterday announced it had
bought a 13.2 per cent stake in Alcatel Standard Electrica, its Spanish
subsidiary, from Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications operator, writes
John Ridding.
The purchase of the shares, for Pta22.23bn (Dollars 178.3m), satisfies a
recommendation by the European Commission that the Spanish operator
eliminate shareholding ties with its transmission equipment suppliers.
The recommendation, made in 1990, followed the acquisition by Alcatel of
Telettra of Italy. The acquisition gave Alcatel, through its Spanish
subsidiary and the Spanish operations of Telettra, about 80 per cent of the
country's transmission market.
Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner, had expressed concern about
Alcatel's dominance of the Spanish transmission market.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Forte creates separate County Hotels chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Forte yesterday reshuffled its hotel portfolio, putting 80 of its
lower-grade properties in a new company which will not carry the group's
name.
Forte said 60 of its Heritage hotels and 20 unbranded properties would be
placed in a new company called County Hotels. The hotels will be promoted
separately from the rest of the group. Forte intends to look for a buyer or
joint venture partner for them.
Forte's Heritage group of hotels will be halved in size to 51 properties
which will be in the three- and four-star categories. The Heritage hotels
are traditional properties in rural locations, historic cities and market
towns.
The group also announced that it would refocus its Forte Grand hotels,
making them partners for the Meridien chain. Forte won control of Meridien
last month, defeating Accor of France.
The Grand hotels are 26 of Forte's first class properties. They include the
Waldorf in London, the Bath Spa and the Balmoral in Edinburgh. Some of the
more traditional Grand hotels, such as the Compleat Angler in Marlow are to
be moved into the Heritage group.
The Grand hotel group does not include Forte's most luxurious properties,
which are part of the Exclusive group.
The reshuffle leaves Forte with the following brands:
Exclusive: these are 17 luxury hotels, including the Plaza Athenee and
George V in Paris, the Sandy Lane in Barbados, the Hyde Park in London and
the Ritz in Madrid.
Forte Grand: 26 hotels.
Forte Heritage: 51 hotels.
Meridien: 54 hotels. Meridien properties are in several cities in which
Forte has had no presence, including Tokyo, Singapore, Jakarta, Bangkok and
New Delhi.
Forte Crest: 30 hotels. These are four-star hotels in city centres and at
airports, offering business facilities.
Forte Posthouse: 65 hotels. These are modern three-star hotels, many near
large towns and motorways.
Forte Agip: 18 hotels. A joint venture with Agip, the state-owned Italian
petrochemical company. These are modelled on Forte Posthouse. The chain has
17 hotels in Italy and one in Hungary.
Forte Travelodge: These are budget hotels, mainly on motorways and main
roads. Forte opens its 100th UK Travelodge on Monday. It also has two in the
Irish Republic and is building two in Spain. It has 436 Travelodges in the
US.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Healthcare's dash for growth - Prospects
for a market valued at more than Pounds 7bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While economists argue over the impact of the UK's demographic time-bomb,
one market is already evolving to cope with the inexorably rising demands of
old age.
The combination of an ageing population and a shift in government healthcare
policy has helped to create a residential and nursing care market which is
conservatively valued at more than Pounds 7bn.
Forecasts suggest that demand will rise by 15 per cent before the year 2000,
adding between 60,000 and 80,000 beds to today's stock of 540,000.
In the wake of community care legislation and the closure of long-term NHS
beds, the healthcare sector has reacted in a piecemeal fashion, with
thousands of small operators concentrating on supplying local needs.
The traditional image dominates the market for caring for the elderly: a
cottage industry of husband-and-wife teams offering small numbers of beds in
converted houses.
Corporate groups account for just 8 per cent of the sector. However, they
are attempting to establish themselves with a series of acquisitions, which
analysts expect to continue for the foreseeable future.
This week shareholders approved APTA Nursing Services' reverse takeover of
Midland Assets to create a 628-bed company specialising in sub-acute care.
The new company, APTA Healthcare, predicts that its number of beds will grow
to 898 by April 1996.
Court Cavendish, which came to the market in July 1993, spent Pounds 13.5m
on acquisitions last year, almost doubling its number of beds to 1,200. The
company plans to add another 500 beds under its acquisition programme.
In July, CrestaCare paid Pounds 12.5m for Scotcare, the Scottish nursing
homes group, boosting its beds by 32 per cent to more than 2,800.
Meanwhile, the larger companies, including Westminster Health Care and
Takare, are concentrating on building their own homes.
'I expect a lot of takeover and merger activity in the future. There are too
many small groups,' said Mr Roger Hardman, healthcare analyst at UBS.
'I see the existing quoted companies doing a lot of capital raising to build
new premises, buying other people's premises, and merging with others to get
the maximum benefits of scale.'
Ashbourne Holdings, one of the UK's largest nursing homes businesses, last
month announced plans for a stock market flotation, which it hoped would
give it a value of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 90m.
Ashbourne aims to raise up to Pounds 50m to clear its debts and launch an
ambitious expansion programme, which includes the construction of three
homes next year.
However, Mr Harald Hendrikse, analyst at Smith New Court, warned that the
market might be reluctant to invest in another nursing home business.
'Although Ashbourne is a very high quality company, they are going to find
it tough to come to the market, because people think there are too many
companies out there.'
Professional care is costly for both the state and the individual. Fees for
those on welfare benefits average close to Pounds 290 per week, but private
patients pay an average of 10 per cent above that. State support only begins
when the patient's assets dip below Pounds 8,000.
The cost of insurance can also be prohibitive. PPP Lifetime charges Pounds
117 a month to a 65-year-old man who wants cover for weekly fees of Pounds
300.
Last month, Bupa, the UK's biggest private health insurer, announced that it
was moving into the long-term health-related insurance market.
Westminster Healthcare is considered the favoured stock in the sector at the
moment, thanks to its 50 per cent rate of private residents. The company is
seen as a high quality operation; its homes boast such extras as jacuzzis.
Some 85 per cent of Takare's patients, on the other hand, are cared for out
of public funds, which means the company is restricted by the fee limits
imposed by local authorities. It has to rely on a low-cost system to secure
its long-term future.
However, shareholders can expect nursing homes companies to demand yet more
cash over the next two years as the dash for growth continues with
acquisitions and new building projects.
'It is going to get more competitive as housebuilders come back into the
market, making it tough to find new sites for nursing homes,' said Mr
Hendrikse.
'In 18 months' time it is probably going to be quite difficult, but if they
scale down their expansion, nursing home companies can basically become
utilities.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Star Song's evangelical choir joins EMI
stable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Where artistry meets ministry' is a long way divorced from the usual record
company hyperbole. It is, nevertheless, the corporate slogan of Star Song
Communications.
Star Song is based in the Country &amp; Western capital of Nashville but its
artistic and moral repertoire is definitely of an evangelical nature.
EMI Music, a New York-based offshoot of Thorn EMI, the music and rentals
group, is strengthening its interests in the 'Christian music' field by
paying Dollars 15.5m (Pounds 9.8m) cash for Star Song, which has a 'strong
roster' of Christian artists and exclusive distribution agreements with
several other leading US Christian music companies.
EMI is already the largest force in this specialist market following its
purchase in 1992 of Sparrow Corporation.
Star Song will operate as a separate label within the EMI stable, and
maintain its 'creative autonomy'. Mr Stan Moser, its current president, will
remain as chief executive officer. 'Where artistry meets ministry is more
than a nice slogan to us. We are dedicated to taking Christ-centred music to
a worldwide audience.'
Mr Jim Fifield, EMI Music's chief executive, said that Sparrow had exceeded
expectations since its acquisition. 'Star Song's extremely diverse and
strong roster will complement Sparrow's and their combined strength will
create new growth opportunities.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Havelock Europa recovery gathers pace with
Pounds 1.56m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Havelock Europa, the store-fitting company, trebled pre-tax profits to
Pounds 1.56m in the first six months of this year, on turnover ahead 24 per
cent to Pounds 15.7m.
The results, up from Pounds 505,000 previously, continued the recovery in
the Scottish-based company's fortunes, which began last year after two years
of losses.
The shares rose 18p to 188p.
Mr Norman Lessels, chairman, said Havelock was profiting from increased
demand from retailers and financial services companies, and gaining market
share in its industry, from which a number of players had dropped out.
Mr Hew Balfour, chief executive, said the company had added Tesco to a list
of clients which included Boots, Woolworths, Safeway and House of Fraser.
Financial services customers made up 20 per cent of turnover, compared with
11 per cent in 1991.
Mr Balfour said the company was seeing the success of a strategy devised in
1992. It was benefiting from improvements in manufacturing efficiency,
additional investment in computer-aided design and alliances with other
companies, such as AT&amp;T, which is a sizeable force in automated cash
machines.
The company had net cash of Pounds 2.4m on June 30, compared with net debt
of Pounds 2.1m a year earlier.
It is to pay its first interim dividend since 1991, of 1p, and a total of
not less than 2.75p (2p) is forecast for the year.
Earnings per share improved from 1.9p to 5.2p.
Mr Lessels said that the second half would, as usual, be stronger in terms
of turnover than the first, although the imbalance between the two halves
would not be as pronounced as in 1993. The order book was buoyant.
Allied Provincial, the company's broker, is forecasting pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 4m and earnings per share of 12.4p for the full year, rising to
Pounds 5m and 14p respectively in 1995.

An exceptional profit of Pounds 1.58m from associates enabled Derwent Valley

Net rental income, benefiting from recent acquisitions, grew 45 per cent to

The exceptional credit arose from settlement of the residual liability in
Dorrington Derwent Investments, following the disposal of that company's

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Waterglade's new board concedes defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The new board of directors at Waterglade International Holdings, the
property development group which had its shares suspended on October 10,
yesterday conceded defeat and said it would not oppose liquidation moves
next month.
Following a boardroom coup in September, the existing management was ousted
and the new board instituted an inquiry into the group's finances with a
view to restructuring the lossmaking business. However, the board reported
yesterday that the group's financial position made any proposed rescue plan
impossible.
Waterglade's liabilities are put at Pounds 29m. Of this, some Pounds 21.5m
is owed to various banks and secured on properties worth not more than
Pounds 9.5m. There is also Pounds 7.5m owed to unsecured creditors  - this
includes about Pounds 800,000 of VAT and the winding up order initiated by
the Customs and Excise office is due to be heard on November 9.
Mr Anthony Midgen, one of the new directors, said he expected the liquidator
to initiate his own enquiries into the running of the company's finances,
and there could also be an inquiry from Customs and Excise.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: County Hall's final step into private
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
County Hall, once home to the controversial Greater London Council, took its
final step into the private sector yesterday, more than eight years after
the government first tried to sell the site.
Frogmore Estates is paying Pounds 17.5m for the three remaining buildings
and land next to Waterloo Station, which it plans to turn into a mix of
flats and offices.
The deal completes the disposal of County Hall (above), following the sale
of the main riverside building to Shirayama, a Japanese developer, in 1993.
While details of this transaction were never disclosed, the government
appears to have raised about Pounds 80m for the site as a whole, far less
than originally hoped.
County Hall Development Group - a consortium which included the London &amp;
Metropolitan property group, merchant bank Lazards and the BBC Pension Fund
 -agreed to pay about Pounds 170m in 1988.
Planning delays and the downturn in the property market caused the plans to
be abandoned and the company was put into receivership in 1990.
The London School of Economics, the UK's leading social science university,
bid Pounds 65m in 1992 and campaigned to get the government to accept its
plans to relocate to the site.
However, the government finally rejected the LSE's proposals in September
1992, after the financial viability of its bid was questioned.
Shirayama is converting the riverside building into a 600-bedroom hotel and
leisure complex. The hotel will be managed by Mr Richard Branson's Virgin
Group and is scheduled to open early in 1997.
Frogmore plans to convert the two buildings adjoining the riverside building
into about 300 apartments. Under previous plans these buildings would have
been demolished.
The company will seek the approval of Lambeth Council, since existing
planning consents are for office and retail use.
Mr Phillip Davies, managing director, said the island building, built on a
roundabout at the entrance to Waterloo Bridge, could be redeveloped as
offices at a later date.
Detailed plans had not been drawn up, he added.
The original County Hall Development Group plans envisaged moving the
roundabout in order to combine the island building with vacant land next to
Waterloo Station. This would make room for a new office building of up to
500,000 sq ft.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Le Creuset 8% lower at Pounds 1.1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Le Creuset, the London-listed housewares manufacturer,
fell by 8 per cent in the first half of 1994 as a result of 'weakness in the
French barbeque market' and the strength of the French franc against the
dollar and the pound.
On turnover which grew by 10 per cent to Pounds 21.3m (Pounds 19.3m),
pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.07m, against Pounds 1.16m.
Mr Keith Divall, UK finance director, said that operating profits of Pounds
1.6m would have exceeded last time's Pounds 1.87m without the effect of the
currency losses and the barbeque problems.
With the French economy 'very quiet' in the first quarter - the barbeque
buying season is from January to April - customers had been buying cheaper
barbeques than the current Le Creuset models. Prices were sharply reduced,
putting margins 'under severe pressure'. Mr Divall said Le Creuset wanted to
gain market share, by having products at different price points, possibly in
partnership with others.
On the currency question, Mr Divall said the group's cost base was mostly in
francs, as was 40 per cent of its income. Dollars and sterling accounted for
30 per cent each. He did not expect currency to have the same drastic effect
over the full year, however.
The story in the UK and the US was brighter with increased sales and 'very
satisfactory' demand.
Earnings advanced to 5p (4.8p) per share.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Go-Ahead executives take pay-cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a move which appears to fly in the face of recent corporate trends,
executive directors of Go-Ahead Group - which floated in May - have taken a
pay cut.
The reduction applies to the year to July 2 when the Gateshead-based bus
service operator lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 315,000 to Pounds 2.87m,
exceeding the prospectus forecast by 25 per cent.
The total remuneration for Mr Martin Ballinger, managing director and
highest paid director, declined from Pounds 131,000 to Pounds 101,000, with
his salary falling to Pounds 90,000 (Pounds 117,000). The emoluments
(excluding pension contributions) of Mr Trevor Shears, finance director, and
Mr Christopher Moyes, commercial director, fell from the Pounds
115,000-Pounds 120,000 band into the Pounds 80,001-Pounds 85,000 band.
Mr Shears said that directors sold some 6.63m shares at 120p at the
flotation, and said that previous pay had included a 'bonus ownership
reward'. From next year this will replaced by dividends on the directors' 34
per cent holding.
Mr Shears said the executive salary levels were 'what we believe to be right
for a business of our size'. He added that they were still tied to a public
sector background, from the management buy-out in 1987. The fear of being
seen as 'nasty capitalists' and the recommendations of the Monk Survey on
size of business and regional position also contributed.
A recent survey of directors' pay by actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow showed that
executive salaries have risen by 8.5 per cent this year. Mr Shears said he
expected Go-Ahead directors' salaries to rise in line with inflation next
time.
The annual results included some four months' contribution from Oxford Bus
Company and six months from Brighton &amp; Hove Bus Company. On Tuesday, the
group completed the near-Pounds 24m acquisition of London Central Bus
Company.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BAe instructed not to notify EU - DTI says
bid for VSEL affects UK's 'essential security interests'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government yesterday warned Brussels not to interfere in British
Aerospace's agreed bid for VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has written to the
European Commission stating that it would not be appropriate for Brussels to
vet the merger under the EU Merger Regulation as the bid 'affects the UK's
essential security interests'.
Asserting rights under article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, which allows
member states to take measures to protect their essential interests, the
government has also written to BAe instructing it not to notify Brussels of
the deal.
Under EU merger rules, BAe and VSEL had until yesterday to pre-notify
Brussels.
Normally, failure to notify the Commission could result in the companies
being fined up to 10 per cent of their turnover. Brussels sources said
yesterday, however, that neither company would be in jeopardy if they were
acting on the UK government's instructions.
The government could have allowed them to notify the deal and then request
the merger be dealt with by the UK competition authorities, arguing that
issues of national security were involved.
However, the government decided that the notification process itself, which
involves companies supplying vast quantities of information about their
finances, the structure of markets and research and development, would not
have been in the national interest.
The Commission's response is not expected until next week. But Mr Colin
Overbury, former head of the EC Merger Task Force and a consultant to City
lawyers Allen &amp; Overy, said Brussels had shown itself to be flexible where
defence issues were involved.
The crucial question would be whether other member states objected to the
merger on grounds that it adversely affected their defence procurement or
defence industries.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Last credits for Ealing as receivers are
called in
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest instalment in the chequered history of Ealing Studios, the home
of classic British films such as Passport to Pimlico and the Lavender Hill
Mob, came to an end yesterday when BBRK Group, its parent company, went into
administrative receivership.
BBRK, a group of film lighting and special effects businesses, bought Ealing
Studios two years ago in a Pounds 6.1m deal with the BBC. BBRK has since
tried to revive the old Ealing tradition by relaunching the studios as a
centre for film production.
However, yesterday BBRK was forced to call in administrative receivers for
all its subsidiaries including Ealing. The studios are now being run by
Casson Beckman, the insolvency practitioner, which said the full extent of
its liabilities would not be known until early next week.
The receivership comes as a blow not only to Ealing itself but to the entire
British film industry which has recently made some progress in its attempts
to relaunch the UK as a production centre for the Hollywood film studios.
Ealing has long been regarded as a totem for the industry's fortunes. The
studios were established in Ealing, an inconspicuous suburb of west London,
in 1907 and within five years became the biggest film production centre in
the UK.
Ealing's heyday was in the 1940s when, under Sir Michael Balcon as head of
production, it turned out a string of classics - including Kind Hearts and
Coronets and Whisky Galore - to entertain the British public during the
second world war and post-war years.
The Balcon formula of waspish comedies free from violence and bad language
seemed anachronistic by the 1950s. The BBC bought the studios in 1957 and
Ealing had a new lease of life as the source of classic television drama
series such as Colditz and The Singing Detective.
Since selling the studios in 1992, the BBC has continued to use Ealing for
drama production, while BBRK has tried to drum up film contracts.
Casson Beckman said it intended to continue with the productions now being
shot at Ealing, including a BBC drama series and a new film version of Jane
Eyre, directed by Franco Zefferelli and starring William Hurt.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Losses increase at refocused Harrington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harrington Kilbride, the magazine publisher, suffered an increased loss
after closing two thirds of its titles to concentrate on contract publishing
and conferences.
Pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.38m in the six months to June 30 compared with a
deficit of Pounds 1.08m for the whole of 1993 and a profit of Pounds 621,000
at the interim stage last year.
There is no interim dividend (1.7p) and the shares fell 10p to 42p.
Turnover in the period under review fell 10 per cent to Pounds 7.88m (Pounds
8.76m), while the cost of sales rose 20 per cent to Pounds 6.12m (Pounds
5.11m). The company blamed its reduced margins on the high cost of
establishing its new conference activities.
In August the company revoked its proposal to pay a 3.2p final dividend for
1993 after bad debt provisions led it to publish re-audited accounts. The
share price almost halved when late extra provisions of Pounds 3m were made
in June.
The company, which claims to be the UK's second largest contract publisher,
expects to turn round its losses in the second half. Fifteen contracts,
worth Pounds 4m of turnover this year, have been won, of which less than
Pounds 1m was recognised in the first half.
Losses per share stood at 13.7p (earnings of 4.1p).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barclays has implemented changes promised by Mr Martin Taylor, the bank's
chief executive following his appointment a year ago, to create a stronger
divide between head office functions and the UK clearing bank.
The bank's head office personnel department is to be split, with many
functions passing to UK banking serv-ices. Mr John Davies, current deputy
director of personnel, will become personnel director for the UK bank.
Within the Barclays group, Mr John Cotton will become the director of group
human resources. The bank said he could head a small central unit that would
oversee broad personnel policy issues and manage senior personnel.
Mr Howard Trust, the legal director of BZW, Barclays' investment banking
arm, has been appointed to a new position of group general counsel from next
January.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: SNC seeks to become full Tokyo member
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smith New Court, the UK-based securities company, said it is seeking to
become a full member of the Tokyo stock exchange when a seat becomes
available.
The Japanese Ministry of Finance has indicated it is unwilling to increase
the number of seats from the current 124 and SNC will be unable to fulfil
its ambition unless an existing member decides to sell a seat. Currently, 24
of the Tokyo stock exchange's seats are owned by non-Japanese firms,
including five held by UK firms.
Once purchase of a seat has been agreed, it would take six to 12 months
before SNC could begin to take full advantage of its stock exchange
membership.
There has been growing pressure for deregulation of the securities industry
in Japan, a move which could increase non-domestic participation in the
markets there.
SNC has operated a representative office in Tokyo since 1987 and has
recently expanded its Asian securities operations. It has seats on the Hong
Kong, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur stock exchanges and has applied to operate
a representative office in Shenzhen.

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Dissident's appointment to board ends row
at Seafield
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row between dissident shareholders and Seafield, the Dublin-based
transport and distribution company, came to an end yesterday with the
appointment of one of the dissidents to the board.
Mr Jonathan Glanz, a solicitor, has become a non-executive director to
represent the interests of Fidex International Trust, the offshore trust
that holds 18 per cent of Seafield.
At an extraordinary meeting last June the dissidents failed to oust Mr Brian
Chilver, chief executive, and Mr Richard Hayes, a director. Yesterday Mr
Chilver said the two sides had gone through a 'good cooling off period'.
'The appointment of Mr Glanz is a positive move and all shareholders will
see it as that,' he said.
The row and the subsequent withdrawal from merger talks of Imari, a private
Irish transport company seeking a listing, cost the group Pounds 88,000.
Nevertheless Seafield reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 220,000 on turnover
of Pounds 7.98m for the six months to end-June, compared with losses of
Pounds 1.06m on turnover of Pounds 16.9m.
The improvement reflected a reduction in interest payable from Pounds 1.57m
to Pounds 359,000 since disposal of the group's property interests.
The group now operates a fleet of 150 lorries and trailers and owns about 1m
sq ft of warehousing. Since a distribution contract for Waitrose ended last
year the group has increased efficiency and lowered costs, lifting operating
profits to Pounds 667,000 (Pounds 505,000).
Earnings per share were 0.33p (1.6p losses).

FT  20 OCT 94 / UK Company News: DFS beats flotation targets with 14% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DFS Furniture, which makes and sells upholstered furniture, lifted both
annual profits and sales to record levels.
But at yesterday's close the share price remained below last year's
flotation price of 260p, even after a 3p gain to 259p - a market value of
Pounds 270m.
Mr Graham Kirkham, chairman, said yesterday that the results had exceeded
the targets set at flotation and represented a 25-year history of increased
profits. They confirmed the company's position as the 'leading specialist in
upholstered furniture in the UK'.
Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of July, excluding exceptionals and
property disposals, increased by just over 14 per cent to Pounds 22.7m,
compared with Pounds 19.9m in the previous 53 weeks.
Sales were 18 per cent ahead at Pounds 134.9m (Pounds 114.2m). Operating
margins were almost unchanged at 16.2 per cent.
Net cash increased from Pounds 16.1m to Pounds 26.8m. Mr Chris Ferris,
finance director, said expansion plans would be met from operating cash
flow. 'We have never borrowed and in view of the cash generation there is no
need to do so,' he said.
While admitting that its cash pile is large, DFS believes it would not take
many freehold retail opportunities to bring it down quickly. The group,
which now employs a workforce of 680, opened three branches last year,
taking the total to 29. It is planning to open in Swindon this year, and to
add a further four outlets in 1995-96.
Capital expenditure this year is expected to remain steady at Pounds 6.9m.
Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 886,000.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 1.36m related to the costs of the flotation.
In the previous year there was a charge of Pounds 13.4m for one-off payments
to directors and pension contributions.
Earnings per share grew to 14.39p (13.02p). A final dividend of 4.9p is
proposed, taking the total for the year to 7.2p, against 6.4p.
COMMENT
The retreat of the shares from the year's high of 354p in January looks like
the result of disappointment at the rise in interest rates, lower durable
goods sales and the continuing weak housing market. Even so, the DFS
management has delivered everything it promised at the flotation, performing
well in a difficult year. Its approach is inherently conservative: it likes
freehold properties paid for out of strong cash flow. The in-house
manufacture of 15 per cent of its sales puts it in a strong position when
dealing with other suppliers. Expansion plans are constrained mainly by the
difficulty of finding and training the right staff - with only 7 per cent of
a fragmented market there is plenty to play for. Estimated profits of Pounds
26m this year - a prospective p/e of 15.7 - leave it at a slight premium to
the sector, which seems fair enough for a retailer with a strong format and
plenty of room to grow.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Digital reports smaller loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Digital Equipment reported smaller than expected losses for its first fiscal
quarter as revenues grew modestly. The results raised hopes that the
computer manufacturer would achieve its goal of returning to profitability
by mid-1995 after four years of heavy losses.
Digital reported a net loss of Dollars 131m (Pounds 83m), or 98 cents per
share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 154m, or Dollars 1.14 per share,
for the same period last year. Total operating revenues for the quarter were
Dollars 3.12bn, up nearly 4 per cent from Dollars 3.01bn from the same stage
a year ago. A one-off gain of about Dollars 65m from a change in accounting
methods, was partially offset by one-off losses related to several small
divestments, the company said.
Analysts had been anticipating a loss of around Dollars 1.31 per share, so
Digital's first-quarter performance was viewed favourably, and the company's
share price gained Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 31 7/8 at the midsession.
'While we are not satisfied with any loss, the current quarter's results
contain many encouraging signs', said Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief
executive.
Revenues from product sales were up 6 per cent at Dollars 1.6bn while
service revenues were virtually flat at Dollars 1.47bn. 'This is the first
time in six years that we have seen three consecutive quarters of order
growth,' said Mr Palmer. Sales of computers based on Digital's Alpha
microprocessor more than doubled and now represent 19 per cent of product
revenues, he said.
Digital's personal computer sales also grew strongly, nearly doubling to
about 22 per cent of product revenues, or about Dollars 363m. Digital
continued to cut costs in the first quarter, with sales and general expenses
down 4 per cent at Dollars 836m.
The company eliminated about 4,000 jobs during the quarter. Its workforce
now stands at approximately 73,800, down from 115,000 two years ago. The
company said that it is on track to achieve a 20,000 reduction by the end of
the fiscal year, but noted that job cuts are behind schedule 'in two major
European countries' which executives declined to identify.

FT  20 OCT 94 / BAe offered GEC talks on defence merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace has told GEC that it would be prepared to resume talks on
merging the two companies' defence interests, which were abandoned a year
ago, if GEC does not attempt to stymie its Pounds 497m bid for VSEL, the
shipbuilding company.
According to businessmen close to both companies, the offer was made at a
secret meeting on Tuesday between Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, and
Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director. It is understood that GEC was
unimpressed and there was no agreement between the two companies. 'It's a
Mandy Rice-Davies situation,' said a financier close to GEC. 'They would say
that, wouldn't they.' He was doubtful that the offer of defence merger talks
would have been carried through.
The meeting was held at BAe's request, following reports that GEC was
considering both a bid for VSEL and for BAe itself.
Mr Bob Bauman, BAe's chairman, said yesterday that he had a policy of 'never
commenting' on confidential meetings.
Last week, BAe made a recommended takeover offer for VSEL. BAe said last
night that it remained 'totally committed' to this bid. GEC will decide in
the coming week whether to make a cash offer for VSEL.
A hostile takeover bid by GEC for BAe, which Lord Weinstock was considering
last week, has become extremely remote, after the rise in BAe's share price
from 454p a week ago to 478p yesterday. A financier with a close knowledge
of the company said: 'GEC has decided not to go for a hostile bid.' GEC will
make no statement on the issue, because Takeover Panel rules would prevent
it from making a hostile bid for 12 months following any such statement.
GEC cannot decide whether to go for VSEL until it has reviewed confidential
information on the shipbuilder's finances, which was given to Lazard
Brothers, GEC's merchant bank, earlier this week.
Lord Weinstock's main ambition is to engineer the merger of GEC's and BAe's
defence interests, to create a super-contractor to rival any defence
company.
'This is the longest game of corporate cat and mouse that I can remember,'
said a financier.
If BAe were to buy VSEL, its balance sheet would be strengthened and that
might make it more difficult for GEC to prize out BAe's defence interests.
On the other hand, GEC is concerned that any bid by it for VSEL could be
frustrated by a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as GEC
already owns shipyards.
GEC may decide to give BAe a free run and then make a very low bid for the
Pounds 2.5bn UK government contract to build the next generation of five
Trafalgar class nuclear submarines, which VSEL is hoping to win.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Clues to recovery in coming weeks / Preview of corporate
Japan's results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Valuable clues to the quality of Japan's economic recovery will emerge over
the next six weeks, when more than 1,300 listed companies report their
interim results.
The government's Economic Planning Agency declared at the start of September
that Japan had pulled out of its worst post-war recession, confirming what
many securities houses in Tokyo had long believed.
Economic indicators since then have been inconclusive, as might be expected
at the bottom of a shallow growth curve. So the latest reports from
corporate Japan will be the real test of optimism. It will also show whether
foreign fund managers were right to cash in on the high yen and the market's
high price/earnings ratios to turn from net buyers of Japanese shares in
August to sellers in September.
The headline profits figures for the six months to September will provide
less guidance about the health of the industrial economy than what companies
say about business conditions. Forecasts of recurring profits - taxable
earnings before extraordinary items - the most widely used performance
gauge, vary widely.
This is because Japanese companies have great latitude to pad out recurring
profits with sales from securities holdings, or to reduce profits by taking
extraordinary charges at the moment they feel most suitable.
Some heavy one-off charges are expected, such as a Y175bn (Pounds 1.1bn)
securities loss from Hanwa, a steel trader, representing an estimated 3.8
per cent of the entire market's annual profits, according to SG Warburg in
Tokyo. In theory, companies can bury such charges indefinitely, so coming
clean now can be read as a confidence in better conditions ahead, believes
Mr Tom Hill, Warburg equity strategist.
Companies themselves believe that recurring profits will rise 7 per cent in
the full year to March 1995, on stagnant or slightly rising sales, according
to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. If they are right, this confirms an improvement
on the 16.2 per cent fall in recurring profits and 5.4 per cent decline in
sales for the year to March 1994.
Market forecasts, in contrast, are all over the place, ranging from a steep
profits decline to a dramatic recovery.
Several trends are clear. Capital goods producers, including car, electrical
equipment and semiconductor makers, have revised profits forecasts upwards
in recent weeks, on the strength of strong demand for exports plus a mild
pick-up in domestic demand for items such as personal computers. Luckily for
them, the yen has risen less steeply during the current financial year than
in 1993-94, giving Japanese exporters scope to adjust to the pressure on
margins on overseas sales.
For the first time since signs of an economic upturn emerged early this
year, the current recovery is starting to resemble Japan's classic pattern
of a revival from recession led by exports and manufacturing. Exports rose
8.3 per cent in the six months to September, according to the finance
ministry.
Yet the interim reporting season may also throw light on deep structural
weaknesses not present in previous recoveries.
First, there is the poor state of the financial sector, part of which will
be revealed tomorrow when securities houses report their earnings, lower
than expected because of weak stock market turnover. Much more important to
the economy at large will be the banks' interim results, due late next month
. These will confirm that weak demand for loans, as well as banks' own
caution over new lending, is a constraint on economic growth, points out Mr
Robert Burghart, strategist at Smith New Court Securities.
Second, there is the continuing risk of deflation. Manufacturers and service
companies alike have taken an axe to labour costs. They have frozen
recruitment, failed to replace retired staff and cut annual bonuses, which
can represent up to a third of total renumeration. This has been good for
profits, because labour costs have fallen faster than wholesale prices over
the past six months. But labour cost cuts have depressed consumer demand and
helped to drag down prices further, so hitting consumer-related companies'
profits and encouraging further cost cuts, the classic deflationary spiral.
Consumers may, however, be cheered by recent income tax cuts, so popular
fears of deflation are exaggerated, argues Mr Jason James, equity strategist
at James Capel Pacific.
Yet corporate cost-cutting still has further to go, as shown by the fact
that manufacturing industry's operating margins, at 2.6 per cent of turnover
last year, are still well below the 3.8 per cent average for the previous
two decades. If tax cuts can hold off deflation, those cost reductions
should feed through into the much more robust corporate profits rise that
most forecasters expect next year.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Acquisitions spur Smiths to 12% advance over year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Smiths Industries, the aerospace and healthcare group, yesterday reported
better than expected full-year profits buoyed by acquisitions and a
particularly strong performance by its medical systems business.
Pre-tax profits for the year to July 31 rose 12 per cent to Pounds 117.2m
from Pounds 104.6m. The shares gained 7p to close at 447p.
Sales advanced 4.6 per cent to Pounds 759.3m including a Pounds 16.9m
initial contribution from acquisitions such as Deltec, a US medical
equipment manufacturer, which was purchased for Dollars 150m (Pounds 95m) in
June.
The group spent Pounds 129.4m on acquisitions during the year designed to
strengthen its medical systems and industrial operations and offset the
cyclical decline in the aerospace business.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, said the group may make further
acquisitions, but added: 'I would not like to say when and where.' He did
not rule out a strategic acquisition which might be financed by equity but
said smaller acquisitions would probably be for cash.
Mr Hurn said the year had been one of 'strong progress' for the group. 'All
three of our business groups performed well in their different markets. We
used our cash for acquisitions, and kept up a high level of R&amp;D in
aerospace.'
Spending on research and development reached a new peak of Pounds 122m
(Pounds 118m), of which Smiths funded Pounds 44m (Pounds 49m) and customers
the rest.
Operating profits of Pounds 113.3m (Pounds 102.8m) included a Pounds 2.5m
contribution from acquisitions. For the second year running, medical systems
contributed more to group results than the aerospace division which saw
trading profits fall 4 per cent to Pounds 38.9m on sales of Pounds 374.2m
(Pounds 392.8m)
Despite the decline in sales, aerospace margins were maintained above 10 per
cent by further job cuts and other cost reductions. Employment in the
division has been cut by 45 per cent over the past four years.
Medical systems increased trading profits by more than 13 per cent to Pounds
46.6m on sales of Pounds 200m (Pounds 181m). Existing businesses generated
11 percentage points of the profit increase.
The expanded industrial division increased trading profits by 32 per cent to
Pounds 27.8m, helped by a full-year contribution from Vent-Axia, the
ventilation fans manufacturer, and four new businesses which were acquired
during the year for Pounds 35m. Sales increased from Pounds 152m to Pounds
184.7m.
Smiths generated Pounds 128.8m in operating cash flow during the year and
ended the period with net borrowings of Pounds 20.4m representing gearing of
9.6 per cent.
Earnings per share share grew 11.3 per cent to 26.6p (23.9p) and a final
dividend of 8.4p (7.55p) is proposed making a total of 13p (11.85p).

FT  20 OCT 94 / Russia faced with radical budget: Austere approach aimed at
reducing inflation to 1% a month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russia's most important economic ministries will today urge the cabinet to
adopt a 'big bang' approach to fiscal reform, marking a sharp shift away
from the previous gradual approach.
The finance ministry and the ministry of the economy are proposing a draft
budget aimed at bringing down the level of inflation to 1 per cent a month
in the second half of next year. Cabinet discussions on the budget start
today.
The plan requires the government to cease taking credits from the central
bank. It will meet strong opposition from some of the most powerful
ministries - including defence, agriculture and energy. However, the finance
and economy ministries have broadly agreed the approach, and expect to push
it through the cabinet meeting by arguing that the country has no choice.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for the economy and one of the
architects of the budget, said yesterday that to continue the present policy
of gradual reform might mean stabilisation in two or three years - 'but it
would mean periodic crises like the one we had last week when the rouble
fell'.
The budget debate comes at a time of heightened tensions between Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, and President Boris Yeltsin. On Tuesday
there were rumours that Mr Chernomyrdin had resigned but he and the
government denied this. Mr Shokhin said: 'There are forces around the
government who try to profit from the absence of the prime minister.'
Mr Chernomyrdin returned from his holiday last night and is scheduled to
present the budget to a special session of the Russian parliament next
Thursday.
According to finance ministry figures, the draft budget forecasts an income
of Rbs131trln and expenditure of Rbs208trln - that last figure slashed back
from around Rbs260trln in earlier drafts. The budget deficit would be around
8.3 per cent of gross domestic product.
Mr Shokhin made clear that the success of the new strategy would require
strong support from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. He
said he hoped for loans of some Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5bn) from the IMF in the
form of a standby agreement and the addition of a third tranche to an
economic reform loan of which Dollars 3bn has been drawn down. If the
strategy proved successful, he hoped for a further Dollars 6bn loan to
stabilise the rouble.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Probe urged into alleged payments to Tory MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government was last night urged to investigate fresh allegations of
'sleaze' after reports connecting two more Tory MPs with 'cash for
questions' payments.
The allegations, published in today's Guardian newspaper, concern Mr Neil
Hamilton, the trade and industry minister, and Mr Tim Smith, the Northern
Ireland minister.
Mr Stuart Bell, a Labour trade and industry spokesman, said in the Commons
that, according to the report, a leading parliamentary lobbyist was paid
thousands of pounds for parliamentary questions to be tabled by the two men
at Pounds 2,000 a time.
The questions were about the takeover of Harrods, the London department
store, and were reported to have been tabled in the late 1980s at the height
of the battle between Lonrho and the House of Fraser. Mr Hamilton and Mr
Smith were backbench MPs at the time.
Mr Bell added: 'They were both named in the article as recipients of
payments passed to Ian Greer Associates by Mohammed al-Fayed, the owner of
Harrods, on top of Pounds 50,000 on a parliamentary lobbying campaign.'
He called for an urgent statement from the prime minister on the report.
Mr Hamilton could not be reached for comment last night. The Northern
Ireland Office said Mr Smith had no comment. A Downing Street spokesman
declined to make any immediate comment on the accusations.
The report came as a parliamentary inquiry into allegations that Tory MPs Mr
Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick accepted payment for tabling
parliamentary questions was thrown into chaos after seven Labour MPs
withdrew because it is not to be be held in public.
Meanwhile, another powerful committee of MPs decided not to investigate
allegations that Mr Mark Thatcher, the son of the former prime minister,
received Pounds 12m in commission from an arms deal negotiated by the
British government in the 1980s.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Blair's allies to get economic role in shadow cabinet
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair will today carry out an important reconstruction of the shadow
cabinet with the aim of tightening his grip on Labour's economic strategy.
After Labour MPs last night made three changes to the 18-strong shadow
cabinet, the Labour leader was expected to put allies in all mainstream
economic portfolios.
Mr Gordon Brown will stay as shadow chancellor. Ms Harriet Harman will
probably move to shadow Mr Michael Portillo in employment. Mr Donald Dewar
is to stay at social security, with Mr Jack Cunningham possibly taking over
at trade and industry.
That would leave all economic portfolios in the hands of the party's
modernising wing.
Mr Cunningham's certain move from shadow foreign secretary would make room
for Mr Robin Cook, the traditionalist who topped the poll for the second
year running, to replace him.
The main uncertainties after last night's result, which saw the election of
a record five women, seemed to be over home affairs and education. Mr Jack
Straw, currently shadow environment spokesman, was being tipped by some to
take over as shadow home secretary, in spite of his surprisingly weak
performance in the election.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the former deputy leader who was re-elected in second
spot, would be a strong candidate for either post. Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow
heritage secretary, is another possible contender to replace Mrs Ann Taylor
in education.
There was disappointment for Mr Blair in that younger allies - Mr Brian
Wilson, Mr Alistair Darling and Mr Alun Michael - failed to be elected.
They are expected to secure important jobs on Labour's front bench when Mr
Blair reallocates the lower-ranking portfolios.
The result, which saw only one MP - Mr Tom Clarke - leave the shadow
cabinet, was being portrayed by the leadership as the consolidation of a
strong team.
As well as the return of Ms Harman and Mrs Beckett, the ballot saw the
election of Mr Gavin Strang, MP for Edinburgh East and shadow agriculture
spokesman.
The results (in order of votes received): Mr Robin Cook, Mrs Margaret
Beckett, Mr Gordon Brown, Mr Donald Dewar, Ms Harriet Harman, Mr Frank
Dobson, Mr George Robertson, Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Mr Chris Smith, Mr Jack
Cunningham, Mr Michael Meacher, Mr Ron Davies, Mr David Clark, Mr Jack
Straw, Mr David Blunkett, Ms Joan Lestor, Mr Gavin Strang, Mrs Ann Taylor.

FT  20 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gap between the bulls and bears on the outlook for the currently
moribund UK housing market is surprisingly wide. Predictions for house price
inflation range from a 30 per cent increase by the end of 1999 to nearly 50
per cent. Bulls and bears alike can root out evidence to support their
forecasts. The bears stress falling tax privileges for mortgage holders,
high levels of indebtedness and negative equity, and a weak demographic
outlook. The continuing fall in numbers employed is still undermining job
security and confidence. Finally, they argue there has been a structural
shift in attitudes: low inflation provides little incentive to see housing
as a speculative asset rather than a living space. The bulls, led by UBS,
question the weight given to such factors and say underlying macro-economic
growth will drive house prices upwards. Most importantly, they believe the
UK's historic inability to hold down prices during economic upturns
guarantees galloping house inflation.
The bulls' scenario would be undermined if the government delivers on its
rhetoric. If inflation remains low, then housebuilders, DIY merchants, white
goods manufacturers and the like face a gloomy end to the century. No matter
which scenario proves accurate, the mortgage lenders, geared for a peak of
2m property transactions a year, look chronically over-staffed. Even UBS's
optimistic model predicts only 1.8m transactions by 1997. With high
operational gearing, the lenders should be seeking to cut at least 10 per
cent of overheads, if not more.

FT  20 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Booker
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given that Booker's dividend cover last year was 1.3 times and falling,
shareholders have more than a passing interest in its quality of earnings.
Salmon farming has become a highly cyclical, commodity business with wide
price fluctuations and regular bouts of disease. So the relaxed reaction to
the proposed acquisition of Marine Harvest is testimony to the
persuasiveness of new chief executive Mr Charles Bowen.
The deal will spread Booker's salmon risks by bringing in Chilean production
and adding sales in the fast-growing US and Japanese markets. Disease
control has also improved significantly over the past few years. Yet it is
hard to argue the acquisition will reduce Booker's risks as a group. The
purchase will more than treble its salmon production to nearly Pounds 100m a
year. Though Booker argue this is modest in the context of group sales of
Pounds 3.5bn, fish farming will contribute about a tenth of its profits.
Although Booker cannot eliminate salmon cycles entirely, it is currently
making good money. It is also convinced it can cut costs faster than the 2-3
per cent a year fall in prices it predicts. But even after cost savings of
around Pounds 3m a year, the Pounds 76m purchase price will not look a
bargain if the 11 times multiple proves to be calculated on peak earnings.
There was a real bargain to be had in 1992 when Unilever sold the Marine
Harvest salmon business for Pounds 22m, but Booker passed up the chance.

FT  20 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Smiths Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A third of the 12 per cent increase in Smiths Industries pre-tax profits
last year was due to acquisitions and exceptional items. But it would be
churlish to take issue with Smiths' achievement in attaining record profits
and earnings per share at this point in the economic cycle. With half of its
turnover deriving from the deeply troubled aerospace sector, Smiths'
management has deftly avoided the substantial problems encountered by other
companies in the sector.
Smiths' success lay in defending or enhancing margins in its three core
business areas. In aerospace, for example, turnover slipped but margins were
maintained at more than 10 per cent. In medical systems, they rose to an
enviable 23.3 per cent, in the face of rising costs and the difficult US
healthcare environment. Despite Smiths' small size compared with
international competitors, its concentration on profitable niches has
evidently insulated the group from the full force of recession. Moreover,
the ample cash generated by the core businesses has been sensibly deployed
on a succession of unspectacular but well-timed industrial and healthcare
acquisitions.
At present, the group's aerospace activities are dormant in profits terms.
After a drastic restructuring, the awakening promises to be spectacular,
even if recovery in the sector is still some years off. But investors should
not be deterred by the delay. Analysts expect the group to make pre-tax
profits of Pounds 130m-Pounds 133m in the year to next July, putting the
shares on a modest premium to the market.

FT  20 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Defence manoeuvres
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC may well want to retain the freedom to make a hostile bid for British
Aerospace as a way of chivvying it into friendly talks on merging their
defence interests. But actually moving ahead with a hostile bid can never
have been more than a last-ditch option. BAe would have been able to use its
immense strategic importance to create the most almighty political stink.
The ensuing fight would have been more bitter even than GEC's two bids for
Plessey in the 1980s.
This does not mean Lord Weinstock will believe BAe's promise to resume
friendly talks provided GEC gives it a free run in its bid for VSEL. If BAe
bags the submarine maker, it will be under little pressure to accede to
GEC's demands. VSEL's cash pile will strengthen BAe's balance sheet, while
earnings should be enhanced as the submarine group's profits could be set
against BAe's tax allowances.
A bid by GEC for VSEL must therefore remain a high possibility. Lord
Weinstock would probably have to pay more than VSEL was worth as a
stand-alone entity. But he might be able to justify such a bid to himself on
the grounds that it would keep BAe vulnerable and open to approaches.
Lord Weinstock's hopes of restructuring the UK defence industry through a
mega-merger may not be an ideal option. Far better to reorganise Europe's
industry through a series of cross-border mergers. The snag is that concerns
over national sovereignty make such deals politically impossible. But if BAe
wants to escape GEC's affections once and for all, it will have to advance
beyond its current mish-mash of continental alliances.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Competition for the investor's dollar: US retail investment
brokers' fight against the giants of the financial services industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's sale of Kidder Peabody to rival Wall Street securities house
PaineWebber has created a new member among the elite of the US retail
brokerage business.
By acquiring Kidder, Paine-Webber boosts the size of its army of
stockbrokers to 6,600. Only Merrill Lynch (with about 12,200 brokers), Smith
Barney (11,200) and Dean Witter (7,300) are bigger.
These brokers are the front line of the retail investing industry. For
PaineWebber, the extra hands will allow the firm to compete more effectively
with the other giants of the financial services industry - the mutual fund
groups, banks, insurance companies and discount brokers  - which are
scrapping for the right to manage the trillions of dollars Americans have
invested in financial assets.
Retail investment broking in the US has not always been so competitive.
Little more than a decade ago, it was a relatively simple business. Its
targets were people like the dentist from Des Moines with a little money to
spare. He could buy a certificate of deposit from a bank or a government
bond from a broker and know that his money was secure. If he wanted to risk
his capital, he could buy one of the few mutual funds sold by fund groups
or, more likely, invest it directly in the stock market through a broker
like PaineWebber.
Today, the Des Moines dentist has been joined by millions of other Americans
who want to invest in securities. They can choose from a vast array of
investment products sold by a variety of financial intermediaries.
The fastest growth has been recorded in the mutual fund business, amid
intense competition between financial services providers. In 1980, just 6
per cent of US households invested in a mutual fund. Ownership levels had
jumped to 27 per cent of households by the end of 1992 (the most recent date
for which data are available). Today, mutual fund assets total Dollars
2,200bn, up from only Dollars 50bn in 1977, and more than double the total
just five years ago.
Mr Joe Grano, head of Paine-Webber's retail broking force, says the flow of
money in recent years into investments such as mutual funds has been
'mind-boggling'. 'There has been a mad rush by non-traditional competitors
to get into our business,' he says.
These 'non-traditional competitors' include discount brokers, banks,
specialist fund groups and insurance companies, which are fighting over the
retail dollar with full-service brokers such as Paine-Webber and Merrill
Lynch.
The discount brokers have prospered in recent years by offering investors
low-cost services. Since fixed commissions were abolished in 1975, firms
such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity Brokerage and Quick &amp; Reilly have been
steadily winning business from the full-service brokers.
Although dwarfed by the full-service firms in the size of their broking
forces and assets, they now account for about 14 per cent of retail broking
commissions in the US, up from about 5 per cent 10 years ago. Firms such as
Charles Schwab have been particularly successful in winning mutual funds
business from the big brokers by offering investors an easy way to buy into
a wide range of mutual funds with low commissions and 'no-load' funds that
charge no commission.
Insurance companies are also beginning to make their presence felt in the
retail market. Mr Bill Hartman, securities industry analyst at JP Morgan in
New York, says that insurers have a built-in advantage over other financial
services firms because of their long experience in selling specialised
tax-efficient investment products direct to investors.
Mr John Steffens, executive vice-president of Merrill Lynch, the second
largest mutual fund manager in the US, is taking the threat from the
insurers seriously. 'The insurance companies have some definite advantages,
because they have significant relationships (with customers), big asset
bases, and large distribution systems in place.'
The biggest threat to full-service brokers' retail investment business,
however, comes from the banks. They can sell investment products through
their large branch networks, which offer growing competition to the brokers'
own distribution networks.
Banks are relatively recent entrants into the retail investment market after
decades in which regulatory barriers kept the banking and securities
industries apart. Five years ago, banks managed mutual fund assets worth
Dollars 43.8bn. By April of this year, that figure had jumped to Dollars
219.4bn, or 10 per cent of the mutual fund market.
The growing competition in the retail investment market is encouraged by
demographic trends which are increasing the demand for savings products,
says Mr Grano of PaineWebber. As the number of retired people expands, the
working population will have to save more to pay for care of the elderly, he
says. In the next 30 years, the number of people over 65 will double.
He also expects a rise in demand from the generation of baby-boomers, now
passing the age of 40. 'They are entering a period of their life when they
have the most earning power and disposable income,' he says.
Financial services providers are coming up with an ever-wider array of
products tailored to their customers' needs. These range from futures and
options, to new forms of pension plans and funds investing in emerging
market.
Technology is revolutionising the industry by providing investors with new
ways to make investment decisions and to acquire financial information. They
can initiate transactions and monitor the performance of their investments
on a laptop computer at home or in the office, 24 hours a day.
Mr Roger Servison, head of the Fidelity group's discount brokerage unit,
says 71 per cent of phone calls to the fund group - the largest in the US -
are answered by computers which use automated response technology to provide
the caller with the information required.
These new techniques also allow brokers, fund groups and their competitors
to improve efficiency and save money. Without automated response technology,
says Mr Servison, the company would need to hire an extra 4,000 employees.
By allowing firms to cut their costs, technology also enables them to charge
lower fees to their customers, a crucial advantage in a business that has
become so price-sensitive.
Yet not all investors are chasing the lowest commissions: while some want
inexpensive, efficient transaction-based services, other are looking for
high-quality professional investment advice, which does not come cheaply.
As Mr Steffens of Merrill Lynch puts it: 'The market is getting more
segmented. Some people are looking for an increased level of service. Others
are looking for rock-bottom prices just to execute a trade.'
Mr Servison believes investors are increasingly seeking the latter. 'Price
seems to be winning out over advice. On the brokerage side you see it in the
accelerating gains in market share the discount brokers are enjoying over
full-service firms. On the mutual fund side, you see it in the increasing
share of the market the no-load business is winning.'
That view, however, is contested by the full-service brokers. Mr Steffens
says that future prosperity lies in building long-term relationships with
investors by providing them with a broad range of products backed by expert
advice.
Long-term business trends are working in the big brokers' favour, believes
Mr Grano. He says that more than 20 years ago, brokers mostly concentrated
on handling investors' trades. Ten years ago, they worked on attracting
investors' assets. Today, says Mr Grano, success lies in finding solutions
to investors' problems, and meeting their individual needs.
'The '70s were a transactional era. The '80s were an asset-gathering era.
The '90s are a problem-solving era.'
If he is right, the full-service brokers may yet hold their own against the
competition over the rest of the decade. With thousands of highly paid
brokers, costly branch networks and hundreds of millions of dollars invested
in technology, they cannot afford to be wrong.

Pity poor old Malcolm Barr, chairman of Barr &amp; Wallace Arnold Trust, who is
currently besieged by his two rebellious nephews.
Young master Nicholas and master Robert are calling for the heads of no less
than the chief executive and finance director, and claim they have the
backing of a majority of the shareholders of the leisure and motor
distribution group.
For uncle Malcolm, 68, the prospect of losing his chief executive is an
uncanny reminder of his other job as chairman of Leeds Permanent building
society. He has been searching for a chief executive since February 1993,
when Mike Blackburn escaped to run the Halifax building society. After 22
years on the board of the Leeds, Malcolm retires in January - an event which
may in itself speed up one of the longest running CEO searches in recent
times.
But the question remains whether Barr &amp; Wallace will still be his nice
little earner in retirement. After all, to lose one chief executive may be
regarded as a misfortune; to lose two might look like carelessness. Perhaps
he should take a few tips from his loyal son-in-law, show jumper John
Whitaker, on how to stay in the saddle.

So Bill Gates, Wunderkind entrepreneur, co-founder of Microsoft and the
richest man in the US, is not invincible after all. His well-flagged book on
the future of the information highway, titled The Road Ahead, has taken a
wrong turn on the way to publication.
Viking, which is thought to have paid an advance of more than Dollars 2.5m
for the rights to publish Gates's musings, now says that the book's release
has been postponed - from November to next March.
Also delayed - again - is the launch of Microsoft's next version of Windows
PC software, which was originally scheduled for release in 1993 and is not
now expected until May or June 1995. Could the latter have proved something
of a distraction for the first-time author?

Conclusive evidence that Germany's once madcap
Green party has sold out to the political establishment.
The dedicated environmentalists, who now constitute the third largest
parliamentary group in the Bundestag, had earmarked November 4 and 5 for the
party conference. Now the proceedings, to be held in Cologne, will be
squeezed into the one day, November 5.
The reason? A rather large number of the delegates apparently wish to attend
the annual press ball in Bonn the previous evening, a huge but tedious event
attended by the massed ranks of the great and good.
Tickets cost DM250, black tie is obligatory, and about the best
entertainment is to be had watching self-important politicos fall over each
other to secure their picture in a Sunday newspaper. All that mould-breaking
understandably produces a thirst for some champers.

Golfers in search of the ultimate water hazard need look no more. Royal
Caribbean Cruise Lines has designed an 18-hole golf course complete with
sand traps, trees and Scottish heather to go on top of its latest ship,
Legend of the Seas.
Royal Caribbean insists that it 'isn't one of those miniature golf courses
with windmills, pirates and volcanoes'. The all-weather course has been
designed to be as challenging as some of 'the great courses of the world'.
Admittedly, the longest hole is 32 feet and the tees are only 5ft wide, but
the shipping company insists that there is a big demand out there.
It has even dredged up some statistics to prove that the number of rounds of
mini-golf played in the US has risen from 100m in 1980 to 170m this year.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Observer: Communist capitulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What do Lord Prior, chairman of GEC, Robert Kuok, the Malaysian tycoon owner
of the South China Morning Post, and communist official Zhang Baifa have in
common?
They are governors of Beijing's newest club. Appropriately known as the
Capital Club, it is not only located in the Chinese capital, but is also
housed on the 50th floor of a building called the Capital Mansion.
Membership fees - Dollars 5,000 for individuals and Dollars 7,500 for
corporate members - are also pretty capital-intensive.
Officially opened last Saturday, the club is one of a growing band in
Beijing and other Chinese cities where the new business elite can rub
shoulders with Chinese politicos. In this case, other governors include the
vice-mayor of Beijing, who is a close confidant of Deng Xiaoping, and the
vice-mayor of Shanghai.
Sadly, members of the new and much-hyped London Capital Club should not
expect reciprocity, however. The developers of the Chinese venture, Club
Corporation of America - specialists in 'member-sensitive staff' according
to the bumf - have nothing to do with Dieter Klostermann, the Hong
Kong-based chairman of the confusingly similar-sounding CCA Group which is
behind the London project.
Klostermann, who broke away from the American group in 1980 to set up his
own Far Eastern operation, will presumably see his old associates' first
incursion into Asia as something of a provocation. He has his own plans for
Beijing - if there is anyone left to sign up.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Re-engineering the Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The long-standing objective of the UK Treasury has been the achievement of
sustained growth and higher living standards. The manifest shortfall of
Treasury performance against objective in the postwar period makes an
unanswerable case for radical reform of the institutional structure of
Whitehall's most powerful department. The results of the fundamental
expenditure review announced yesterday by Treasury permanent secretary Sir
Terry Burns are, at least by British standards, genuinely radical. But so
were the Treasury policies that culminated in sterling's departure from the
European exchange rate mechanism. How are we to judge these sweeping
reforms?
The striking feature of the UK Treasury is the sheer breadth of its remit.
Unlike the US, France and Germany, it still retains ultimate control over
monetary policy. Unlike the French finance ministry it is the chief source
of economic advice in government and does not leave control of public
expenditure to a separate ministry. Its role is central. To that extent the
current review proposes a wider reform of governmental machinery than
appears at first sight.
No doubt a New Zealand administration would have taken a more vigorous axe
to the various parts of this highly centralised machine. Yet the current
review could hardly be called soft, since it seeks both to decentralise much
of the Treasury's second-guessing role, while dismissing a quarter of the
department's top civil servants. In so far as objectives are being clarified
and senior civil servants are given a less cluttered strategic role, this is
all to the good. Yet there must be some unease at the proposals to push part
of the task of controlling expenditure back on to the spending departments.
There is, admittedly, some merit in devolving responsibility for public
sector pay, in that a Treasury pay policy driven by public expenditure
concerns makes for poor staff management and leads to results that can be
remote from labour market reality. In their wider monitoring role Treasury
officials' concerns are all too often with short-term objectives. The
absence of a public accounting discipline that provides protection for
capital projects as against current expenditure notoriously exaggerates that
fault.
The control of public expenditure is, nonetheless, one of the tasks that the
Treasury has done well by international standards, at least since the second
half of the 1970s, when a catastrophic failure of control led to the arrival
of the International Monetary Fund. And while the Treasury is often accused
of being remote, it does have the advantage of independence in dealing with
the departmental clash of vested interests.
All history suggests that any relaxation over public spending has a nasty
way of ending up in tears. Those who have watched the Treasury's performance
with increasing disillusionment over the years might feel that it is
proposing to loosen its grip in an area where it has done rather well in
order to devote more resources to policy activities where its record has
been dismal. A more fundamental worry is that job insecurity at the top of
Whitehall will dramatically transform the notion of an independent civil
service. Criticism of the Treasury can be overdone. But in view of the
record, a reform of the Treasury driven from within is bound to raise more
than the odd doubt.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the Soviet system was a victory for those who argue that
market forces create a more efficient, dynamic and creative economy than
centralised commands. But the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) observes in its first Transition Report that, despite
some successes, much remains to be done if that victory - now irreversible -
is to be fully exploited.
The central European countries that took harsh measures to restore
macro-economic stability and backed them up with privatisation, legal,
banking and other institutional reforms are already emerging from recession
with much more efficient and productive economies.
In others, notably Russia, performance remains mixed. There privatisation
has moved ahead, but the reforms needed to stabilise the economy remain
seriously incomplete. Ukraine is on the starting block, while in the
war-torn Caucasus the economic base has been largely destroyed and energies
have yet to be focused on reform.
Much has been achieved by the governments and the 450m people who live and
work in the 25 countries surveyed by the EBRD. But the review is also right
to call on wealthy states, which already have functioning market economies,
to help the reinte-gration of the transitional economies into the network of
global trade and investment.
As the report makes clear, the record of the European Union in this respect
leaves much to be desired. Mired in recession for the past three years and
still digesting the Maastricht treaty, the EU has approached trade
negotiations with nit-picking narrowness. It has also been far too ready to
impose anti-dumping and other restraints on trade in 'sensitive' products,
such as steel, textiles and processed foods, which make up the bulk of
exports from central Europe.
The countries in transition desperately need easier access to EU markets,
and the higher foreign investment this would attract, to offset the
unemployment caused by the restructuring of their obsolete Soviet-style
economic systems. Without freer access for their exports and more
investment, it may prove impossible for countries in the region to achieve
the east Asian levels of growth needed to narrow the gap between living
standards on both sides of Europe.
Five years after the collapse of communism, the EBRD's review underlines how
slow western Europe has been in rethinking the future shape of a wider
Europe. Such changes to western thinking and institutions are essential if
western Europe is to seize the opportunities offered by the large potential
markets and cost-effective labour on its doorstep.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Paying the price
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Europe's banks have lost their struggle against legislation which is
intended to ensure quick and cheap transfers of cash across borders. Given
that a quarter of a Ecu100 payment can be expected to disappear in charges,
and small businesses face considerable uncertainty over how long a payment
will take, it is hard to feel too much sympathy for them.
The service has been performed so badly for so long mainly because banks had
little incentive to do better. Cross-border payments were a marginal and
barely profitable activity, accounting for a tiny proportion of a bank's
transfers of cash. The business also had perverse incentives: the longer a
bank delayed the transfer of cash, the more money it gained in interest.
In the past two years banks have woken up to the fact that they could be
missing a trick. As the European market becomes a reality for small
companies, banks have realised that they can attract customers by providing
efficient transfers. A company making many transfers to another country may
value such efficiency above many other kinds.
Yet competition has been painfully slow to raise standards among the mass of
banks. A study carried out by the European Commission shows that charges are
high and services opaque. It would have been preferable for banks to
implement the voluntary charter proposed by Ms Christiane Scrivener, the
consumer affairs commissioner, but there was also a case for Commission
action.
The proposed directive does not appear excessively harsh in most respects.
It is feasible for banks to clear cash into an account within six days; it
is also reasonable to require them to provide clear information about
charges and transfer times. The Commission has avoided any move to set
levels of charges, which may well remain high until the business becomes
less marginal.
In one respect, the directive is too prescriptive. It says that banks should
be banned from double-charging, or levying a charge on the receiver of the
money as well as the sender. It is reasonable to prevent banks doing this
when a customer has clearly instructed them not to do so: to do otherwise is
close to fraud. But there may be cases where customers are happy to split
charges, and many small banks rely on being able to charge for receiving
payments.
Given the efforts of larger banks to improve services, it seems unlikely
that they will be perturbed by the directive. Banking groups argue it
creates an uncertain legal background for their business in the next few
years. But any large bank investing in a project that does not meet the
Commission's minimum standards might as well abandon it as uncompetitive
anyway.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Personal View: Rising pressure on German unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL STURMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the run-up to last Sunday's German elections, controversy over Europe was
conspicuous by its absence. This did not happen out of negligence or lack of
concern. Germany's main political parties simply could not find enough
uncommon ground. So they left it to the marginal parties of a scattered left
to raise the subject: the Greens quarrelled with the Brussels technocrats,
while the recycled communists sounded their perennial anti-capitalist
refrain. Only on the eve of the elections was there a hint of discord. The
leaders of the opposition Social Democrats announced that, if they won
power, they would renegotiate the terms for a future European currency to
guarantee monetary stability.
To be pro-European is not only part of political correctness in Germany. It
also reflects a widely shared notion of national interest, economic
well-being and psychological reassurance. Germany regards the idea of
constructing Europe around an 'inner core' as a practical matter, not a
religious question. However, spelling out Germany's European agenda until
the end of the decade will not be easy.
Germans agree there is no alternative to building Europe. However, it will
not be without toil and tears - as the issues of economic and monetary
union, European defence and the integration of the more eligible central
European countries will remind us in coming years.
First, Germany under Chancellor Helmut Kohl will press for early admission
into the EU of its immediate neighbours to the east. It will be much less
enthusiastic about countries further away. Between the Czech Republic and
the neighbouring German Lander of Bavaria and Saxony, cross-border trade in
goods and services is growing fast. Much German capital investment is
flowing to the Bohemian lands. The direct line between Munich in the south
and Dresden in the east still goes via Prague.
Poland has courageously adopted market reform. Yet it still has not much to
offer that would make it an indispensable member of the EU. Germany's
interest in seeing Poland in the Union has much to do with geography. It
wants a stable neighbour to help to absorb any trouble in the former Soviet
Union.
Hungary, still struggling with the communist past, is badly in need of some
reassurance against the old demons of its Balkan neighbourhood. The big
problem for German policymakers in this part of Europe is that the Common
Agricultural Policy of the past is incompatible, financially and otherwise,
with the German view of the future. But in terms of German farmers and their
political muscle, the CAP has not yet outlived its usefulness.
How to make European security effective after the waning of the Pax
Americana will be even more controversial. The Social Democrats will not
raise their sights about deploying the Bundeswehr, the German armed forces,
outside Nato except under massive United Nations pressure. However, Mr
Kohl's Christian Democrats are starting to understand that serious trouble
in various parts of the world may require quicker action than the UN can
furnish.
The Free Democrats, junior partners in the governing coaltion, will tread
uneasily over security matters. They will give up hope only gradually of
international problems simply melting under the pressure of German goodwill.
Now that the constitution no longer provides a pretext for inaction over
'out of area' Bundeswehr deployment, Germany will agonise about the national
interest in Europe as well as in the wider world.
Last, but not least, the effects of the Maastricht treaty will force the
Germans to confront the D-Mark's future. This issue reaches deep into the
collective memory of a nation that has had two catastrophic inflations this
century. German society has a highly developed need for security, and
Germans share with their French neighbours a distrust of politicians
managing their money. Any suspicion of cross-breeding between the D-Mark
and, say, the drachma would turn Germany into a hothouse of rebellion. The
Germans may play safe and stick to the D-Mark and their trust in the
Bundesbank, but that may not please all their neighbours.
Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Germany is facing the
consequences for the whole of Europe of German unification and the end of
the cold war. Politicians and the wider public still tend to believe that
what is good for Europe is also good for Germany. But the choices ahead will
develop a divisive edge. The 1994 Bundestag elections may have been the last
ones to provide a very nearly unanimous German view of Europe.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Taxes, benefits and jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High pay is better than low pay; but low pay is better than no pay.
Obviously we would all like good, well-paid jobs. But for many people these
are not available, partly because the labour market has shifted to the
disadvantage of workers with low marketable skills. Meanwhile, low-paid jobs
bring some benefit to the national economy, and some gain in self-respect
and morale to those who have them, in the way that dole payments do not.
Every economic gathering proclaims that it should be made worthwhile for
people to work rather than live on social security, but few explain how.
The deterrents are sometimes summarised in terms of a 'tax wedge' between
the gross wage and net payments after tax and social security contributions.
In the UK, the wedge for low-paid workers has been much mitigated as a
result of several past Budgets. But it does amount to nearly 30 per cent on
to the cost of employing workers at about Pounds 200 a week - the lower end
of the middle income distribution range, which is where many of the problems
lie.
Social security contributions are a tax on labour incomes. Indirect taxes
such as value-added tax can be regarded as levied on wages plus profits. So
there might be a modest effect on labour demand by switching from social
security to VAT, but nothing like one-for-one. It is doubtful if a shift to
income tax, which is another tax on labour, would have any notable effect at
all.
As far as employee disincentives are concerned, the Institute for Fiscal
Studies is right to say in its Green Budget that the main deterrent to
accepting a low-paid or part-time job is not so much anything in the tax
system, but the withdrawal of benefits once earnings start. In Britain the
Thatcher and Major governments have put a lot of emphasis on making it more
worthwhile to work and more difficult to live on benefit. Yet the proportion
of the non-employed (unemployed plus working-age people outside the labour
force) has increased from one cycle to another. Labour's Commission on
Social Justice, chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie, is bound to say something on
these matters in its report due to be published on Monday.
The worst disincentives are shown in the chart. A man with one child earning
Pounds 6 an hour is no better off on a part-time job because of the
withdrawal of Income Support, pound for pound, until he reaches a threshold
of 16 hours worked. At this point Family Credit, specifically designed to
make it worthwhile to take low-paid jobs, comes into effect. But much of the
intended gain is negated because the withdrawal rate of Housing and Council
Tax Benefit is added to the withdrawal rate of Family Credit.
The table shows that the combined effect of withdrawing Housing and Council
Tax Benefit amounts to an implicit marginal tax rate of 89 1/2 per cent for
every extra pound earned. If Family Credit is also received, the implicit
marginal tax rate also rises to more than 97 per cent. The worst affected
are spouses of unemployed people who stand to lose Income Support
pound-for-pound if they go to work.
These interactions are made unnecessarily complicated because Housing
Benefit is administered by local authorities for the Department of the
Environment, while Family Credit is administered by the Department of Social
Security; a fusion of the two benefits - which now serve a similar purpose -
is surely overdue.
The IFS also suggests a rent credit in place of Housing Benefit, which would
pay the rent for a family working less than 16 hours a week. Above that a
boosted Family Credit should take over the job. An additional advantage -
which may be psychological - is that there would no longer be an obvious sum
which offset rent for households with even a modest income from work. Thus
people would be more inclined to bargain seriously over rents and to move
out of over-extended accommodation. As for Council Tax Benefit, this is
simply a bribe to local government voters alienated by the poll tax saga;
and the sooner it is phased out and fed back into the general social
security budget, the better.
Even apart from the Housing Benefit complication, Family Credit has the
defect of not being paid to single people or families without children. The
least the Borrie Commission could suggest would be to amalgamate Family
Credit and Income Support, thus bringing together benefits for those in and
out of work. Once it occurs the absurdity of both the 100 per cent cut-off
for the unemployed person taking work and the exclusion of childless
families would become apparent.
Borrie is almost certain to advocate the integration of benefits and taxes
for pensioners. This should be a trial run for a wider amalgamation. But the
acid test will be whether he advocates the amalgamation of working-age
benefits.
The Conservative government will shy away from this minimum reform because
of its preoccupation with the so-called Job Seeker's allowance, which will
amalgamate the contribution-related Unemployment Benefit with the
means-tested Income Support on which most unemployed people in practice
rely.
Ministers did, however, come out at last week's party conference with a
scheme meant to increase the incentives for the long-term unemployed to take
a job in the non-black economy. Although they largely buried their
initiative in a tide of anti-European rhetoric, they did envisage a
'claim-and-save' scheme under which somebody returning to full-time work
would gain a bonus of up to Pounds 1,000.
This will be the light at the end of a long tunnel. Part-timers will still
have every pound they earn clawed back from benefit above the normal Pounds
5 a week minimum. The difference is that half the benefit initially lost
will be put into a fund reclaimable when the person returns to full-time
work.
The scheme is typical of the minimalist reform that civil servants, with the
Treasury breathing down their necks, produce for Conservative ministers.
Apart from the obvious drawback of being long deferred for someone now in
part-time work, the scheme has the further disadvantage of being
once-for-all. In other words, those workers remaining at the lower end of
the income distribution range will soon exhaust their gain.
What conclusions emerge if one draws back from the mass of confusing detail?
As the Green Budget points out, there is a choice. For any given level of
basic benefits there can, at one extreme, be a cut-off rate of 100 per cent
for every extra pound earned. The result would be an extreme work
disincentive for a limited number of people. The other extreme would be a
Basic Income for all, which would be withdrawn only at the income tax rate.
The latter however would have to be much higher than it is now (or some
other tax such as VAT would have to be very high in its place). The result
would be a less prohibitive, but still very heavy, disincentive spread over
far more people.
The present system for income-related benefits is more like the 100 per cent
cut-off rate than the Basic Income. Most reforms amount to moving slightly
towards the latter, but still with high cut-off rates. There could also be a
less inquisitorial administration.
There is in any case no cost-free option. The art is to do the most good for
any given transfer from the main body of taxpayers. Unfortunately the Tories
have too many moralistic hang-ups about reform and Labour too many
inhibitions about 'selectivity' to do this as well as they might.

   OUT OF CONTROL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The New Biology of Machines By Kevin Kelly Fourth Estate, Pounds 16.99, 520
pages
Readers who are intrigued by the plethora of articles and programmes about
'information superhighways' and want to know more about what they really
mean will find Out of Control an excellent introduction that captures the
genuine spirit behind the publicity.
This book by Kevin Kelly, California's leading new wave techno-journalist,
lives up to its title as it weaves wildly between 1,001 subjects: from
electronic banking to the art of beekeeping, from the Gulf war to
post-Darwinian evolution. But in the process it conveys brilliantly the
end-of-millennium excitement felt by many techies about the coming
convergence of computing, communications and biology.
The first primitive manifestation of this convergence is the information
superhighway or I-way. It may lead to the creation of artificial life some
time in the next century, Kelly argues.
In Kellyspeak, out-of-control is the ultimate accolade for a complex system,
whether it is a communications network, a robot or an artificial organism.
It means that the system is evolving beyond the original specifications of
its (human) designers, developing of its own accord into something more
capable and powerful than they could have devised by themselves.
Kelly concludes the book with 'Nine Laws of God' which should be followed by
anyone aiming to create an out-of-control system. The first two laws give
the essence of his message:
1. 'Distribute being'. The spirit of a beehive, the behaviour of an economy
and the thinking of a supercomputer are distributed over a multitude of
smaller units, whose interactions give the whole system a life that is far
more than the sum of its parts.
2. 'Control from the bottom up'. The collapse of centrally planned,
Soviet-style economies shows that no system can run for long on commands
passed down from the top, Kelly says. 'A mob can steer itself, and in the
territory of rapid, massive and heterogeneous change, only a mob can steer.'
Imagine that you are given a million units of intelligence - call them
neurones - to start a system of artificial life. You will achieve more in
the long run if you distribute the intelligence equally among 10,000
creatures, giving 100 neurones to each, than if you create 100 super-beings
with 10,000 neurones each. The reason is that a myriad of different
creatures can work together and evolve in a way that is impossible for a
small number of beings, however intelligent each may be.
Robots to help around the house are a good illustration of Kelly's
many-is-beautiful philosophy. He is not keen on the idea of a few humanoid
robots trundling around like R2D2 in Star Wars, serving us beers or
vacuuming our carpets.
Instead, Kelly enthuses about the prospect of filling our homes with vast
numbers of unobtrusive insect-like 'microbots' - an idea pioneered by
Professor Rodney Brookes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. For
example a tiny 'gnatbot' (Kelly loves coining words) will live in the corner
of the television screen and come out to eat the dust off the glass when the
TV is switched off. Slightly larger cleaning robots will hide under every
piece of furniture, programmed to emerge when they detect that the humans
are away.
Out of Control is far from perfect. It contains inaccuracies, unsupported
generalisations and non-sequiturs galore. Some passages are maddeningly
short; others (such as the chapter on 'Post-Darwinism') ramble on far too
long. And Kelly, who is executive editor of Wired, the Californian magazine
for network surfers, is not critical enough about the futuristic
speculations of his friends and contacts.
Indeed the harshest criticism in the book is aimed at the late George
Orwell. 'No one has been more wrong about computerisation than Orwell in
1984,' Kelly writes. 'So far nearly everything about (computers) indicates
that they are the end of authority and not its beginning.'
Yet, for all its faults, Out of Control is a joy to read, both for its
detail and for the enlivening impression it provides. One reason the book
works so well is that Kelly obviously had fun writing it. His joie d'ecrire
carries the reader happily through all 520 pages.
There is a striking contrast between Out of Control and The Quark and the
Jaguar, another important science book published this summer. Both are
wide-ranging books with complexity theory and the emergence of order from
chaos as central themes.
But Murray Gell-Mann, the Nobel prize-winning author of The Quark and the
Jaguar (Little, Brown, Pounds 18.99), laboured long and hard on his book,
repeatedly rewriting passages to make them as clear as possible. After all
the effort, much of Gell-Mann's prose is indeed reasonably readable but it
does not bubble like Kelly's. As a famous physicist, Gell-Mann is concerned
to maintain his scientific reputation, and so resists the kind of bold but
plausible speculation that makes Out of Control so fascinating.
In terms of content rather than style, however, Kelly could have borrowed a
few thoughts from Gell-Mann, particularly the latter's emphasis on the
all-important role of chance in the evolution of every system in the
universe.
Kelly is too optimistic to consider the risk that sheer bad luck could wreck
his rosy scenarios. If the out-of-control biocomputer systems of the future
do take on a life of their own, will they necessarily develop in the benign
human-friendly way that he predicts?
In the end, Kelly's infectious optimism suppresses such doubts. Out of
Control leaves the reader with a sense of heightened anticipation, looking
forward to riding on the information superhighway to a symbiosis of people
and machines some time in the next century.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Main point of pay-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL D VARCOE-COCKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In a comment on rolling contracts, Lex (October 19) writes: 'Defenders
of rollers say they do not necessarily reward failure as boards can insist
on a reduced pay-off if performance is poor', and suggests that the
departure from Automated Security (Holdings) of its chairman and chief
executive gives it 'the chance to show whether that is so'.
Lex completely misses the fact that the starting point has to be the service
contract. If a company has performed poorly, pay-off can be reduced only if
the contract provides for compensation to be reduced for poor performance.
Of course, if it could be shown that the executive breached the terms of his
employment, that would be another matter. But how many service contracts
('rollers' or not) set out a required standard of performance? Even then it
would be a very difficult task to prove that a company's poor performance
was caused directly by one or more senior executives.
A person who tries and fails should not receive performance-related
benefits, but it must be wrong to try to claw back contractual entitlements
which are not performance-related.

Sir, Mr A Lister's suggestion (Letters, October 8) that the millennium
should be celebrated in the UK by the government removing every traffic cone
from every road by 4.30pm on December 31 1999 is admirable. However, whoever
heard of any government department or associated contractor working between
December 24 and January 3?
Indeed, it is only to be hoped, because of the debate concerning whether the
millennium should be celebrated at the end of 1999 or 2000, that public
services and industry don't decide to bridge the entire year 2000.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A D GATLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Far from leading to the government's defeat in the next election
('Brittan and Howe hit back on EU', October 14), I suspect that in the next
two years Conservative strategists will come to realise that an anti-federal
stance will represent their only chance of winning the next election.
As one who spent a considerable amount of time canvassing in the Euro
election, I can advise Lord Howe and Sir Leon Brittan that present policy
over Europe is deeply unpopular with the majority of the electorate, who are
frustrated at having no democratic way of expressing their resentment at the
steady encroachment of their national identity and institutions.
They also resent being described as 'right wing' for opinions which are held
across the whole political spectrum.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Asylum seekers are dealt with fairly
in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS BAKER MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Without charge' (October 19) about detention of asylum
seekers contained a number of inaccuracies. May I set out the relevant
figures in their context: 22,370 applications for asylum were made last year
which is below the 1991 peak of 44,000 but well above the 1988 figure of
4,000. More than 90 per cent of asylum seekers are not genuine refugees
under the 1951 UN Convention to which Britain adheres. Each application is
considered carefully on its merits in accordance with that convention.
Powers of detention under the Immigration Act 1971 are exercised only where
there are good grounds for believing that the person will not comply with
any conditions imposed, if released. Detention is authorised initially by a
chief immigration officer - not by an immigration officer as you say - and
is reviewed by an immigration service inspector within 24 hours. There are
then monthly reviews at increasingly senior levels. I do not find it
surprising that, in 22 of the cases referred to in the Amnesty International
report, release was granted before the case was finally resolved. This is
surely evidence in itself of the effectiveness of the reviews.
You say 'some detainees (but not all) are eligible for bail'. Following
changes made by the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, anyone refused
asylum can appeal to independent appellate authorities and anyone who has
appealed can apply for bail.
It is not the case that immigration officers ignore their obligation to tell
detainees of the reason for their detention. All detainees are told orally,
in a language which they understand, of the reasons for detention. In
addition, anyone who is refused entry or is being removed as an illegal
entrant or is the subject of a deportation order is given notice in writing,
setting out their rights of appeal and giving details of the free advice and
assistance available to them.
Britain complies with its obligation under international conventions to
which it is a signatory. Our system has to deal fairly and promptly with
genuine refugees and at the same time combat bogus asylum claims. Powers of
detention are necessary in some cases. We seek to detain as few people as
possible and less than 1.5 per cent of asylum seekers are currently
detained. Detention is a necessary part of a policy of firm and fair
immigration control.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Legal challenge to state aid can be
easily launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY HOCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In an otherwise excellent comment upon the European Commission and
state aids ('Controlling state aids', October 19) you fail to recognise that
some progress has already been made. Despite the Commission's approval of
the staggering sum of FFr20bn in aid to Air France, it is now easier than in
the past to pursue a legal challenge to the decision.
For its part, the Commission has moved from acting as a 'rubber stamp' for
aid schemes, to much more thorough investigation. It is indicative of this
that the published decision on the state cash injection into Air France in
1992 was less than four paragraphs long, whereas the more recent decision
runs to 17 pages and provides detailed commentary.
It is true that most of the conditions imposed by the Commission upon Air
France were, in fact, proposed by the airline itself. Nevertheless, the aid
will be granted in three phases and will be dependent upon Air France
meeting these conditions. In addition the Commission has gone as close as is
legally possible to secure the privatisation of Air France by making
eventual privatisation a condition of approval.
The weakness in the policing of state aids does not appear to be in the
Commission, which has worked hard to make liberalisation a reality.
Following the decision to allow the Air France aid, Sir Leon Brittan told
reporters that the French had threatened the Commission with an 'empty chair
policy', and the French government said that it would stop at nothing to
ensure that the aid was approved. We can only hope that successful legal
challenges to decisions on state aids and further market liberalisation will
give the Commission stronger grounds to resist political menaces in future.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: True West - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Now the two brothers of Sam Shepard's tense and riveting play True West need
one another; now they are split by mutual jealousy. At first, they seem as
different as Apollo and Dionysus, or Jekyll and Hyde; more crucially, they
resemble Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Then, as the power struggle within
their sibling rivalry develops, they start to swap characters. It appears -
enthrallingly - that each brother is fatally incomplete without the other;
and 'fatal' becomes more or less the word. The play, which started virtually
without plot, winds up in a crescendo of action.
Congratulations to Leeds' West Yorkshire Playhouse and to director Matthew
Warchus for staging this play, and to casting two superlative actors. At the
performance I saw, Mark Rylance was Austin (the younger, more educated,
citified writer) and Michael Rudko was Lee (the older, wild, lone traveller
from the desert). But they exchange roles at alternate performances, and I
am impatient to see them in reverse. Soon, I will have the chance: True West
comes to London's Donmar Warehouse in November. I look forward also to
seeing again, in two small roles, the excellent Marcia Warren's economically
eloquent account of their Mom, and David Henry as (ungrateful role) the
film-producer Saul Kimmer.
No, True West is not a great play. It moves in terms of dichotomies and
parabolas: too schematic. Only occasionally does it relax and add the kind
of unnecessary detail that puts flesh on its lean bones. One such passage is
Austin's hilarious slow narration of how their father lost his teeth. Two
more such passages occur when their Mom talks of (a) Picasso, (b) Alaska.
Later - of course] - we see that Picasso and Alaska are just another pair of
Shepard's dichotomies (civilisation versus the wild, education versus
nature). For that matter, Mom and the unseen Dad are themselves also
artificial polar opposites. All of which is clever, interesting, but not
always real.
Yet True West, as they say, brings up a whole lot of stuff. No-one can miss
the point of the image early on when Austin mounts a stepladder to spray his
mother's house plants, while Lee chucks the beer cans he has finished onto
the floor. Or the chaos later on, when the brothers turn the room into an
urban desert: Lee attacking a broken typewriter with a golf club, Austin
making toast simultaneously in 10 stolen toasters. Even at its most
diagrammatic, the jealousies of brother and brother are shockingly potent.
Warchus' production highlights such moments, but allows the actors to give
performances very close to sheerest transparent. Rudko is so much the
dangerous, needy, plaintive, coyote-like hobo from the desert that I cannot
imagine how he will bring off the opposite role. Rylance, despite one or two
more calculated moments, nonetheless gives an astonishing performance. Just
the way he breathes as, early on, he watches Lee, speaks volumes: as does
the way his soft, grainy voice suddenly finds a driving charge of passion as
he confronts his worst shock of defeat and injustice. I know no male actor
today who can so catch my heart in my throat. This production clinches what
I have felt for some time: that the West Yorkshire Playhouse is the most
vital and refreshing English theatre outside London today.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: Lucinda Childs - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In New York in the early 1960s dance experiment was centred on Judson
Church. There the earnest and the eager set about forging a new dance -
post-modern, post-Cunningham - which sought a radical re-shaping of
everything that 'dance' had meant up to then.
It was, I suppose, symptomatic of its time, and marked by a Puritanism that
accorded well with current theatrical and musical austerities. One of
Judson's formative figures was Yvonne Rainer, who declared 'No to spectacle;
No to virtuosity; No to transformations and magic and make-believe . . .' (I
saw a Rainer performance, which was crucifyingly boring, and offered no
substitute for anything at all - least of all dance). An ideal had been
stated for many who followed in her unlovely footsteps.
This year Lucinda Childs, one of the most acclaimed Judson graduates, is
making a first British visit with her company. Sophie Constanti reported
here on her Edinburgh Festival debut; on Tuesday night, as the Dance
Umbrella season got under way, Miss Childs and her troupe came to the South
Bank - a glum and not inapt location. The Childs manner offers small cells
of activity which repeat and repeat, re-align and slowly mutate - it is no
accident that she uses minimalist scores as accompaniment - so that the
viewer is made aware of a cumulative structure.
This building-blocks approach to dance would be more fascinating - as the
Shades entry in Bayadere is fascinating in its repetitions and augmentation
 -were the blocks themselves of interest. But to pile up banalities, to
shift their direction, to pass them among a cast like so many tiny
austerities, is not so much architecture as parsimony.
The major piece in Tuesday's programme was Available Light, almost an hour
of routines set below and on a bridge-structure. First made as a museum
installation in Los Angeles a decade ago, it has a score by John Adams which
is vastly more enterprising in the working out of its patterns than Childs'
movement sequences. Ten dancers (looking like sci-fi laboratory assistants
in overalls that reveal pallid inner legs and arms) tread and re-tread their
well-worn paths. Virtuosity is Rainer-ishly denied - the cast look
unstretched - and the development of these ideas is simple-minded. ('Those
two have just turned and run. That means that the other two in black, and
then the four in red, will do the same' - and they do). Miss Childs
manifests herself twice, Cunningham-fashion, but even in these unambitious
technical surroundings, her performance has a constrained air.
The second piece, Concerto, dates from last year and uses Gorecki's
harpsichord concerto. It lasts nine minutes, and its dancers, in smart black
shirts and trousers, nip along pre-destined tracks with something like
vivacity. (The trams are moving faster). Here Childs' style matches the
motor energy of the score in recurring patterns of action, if not in
emotional density. The piece is short enough for the message to seem
intriguing without turning into an acreage of tape-loop repeats. Brevity is
not the soul of post-modernism - but it is a tremendous bonus here.
Lucinda Childs is at the Queen Elizabeth Hall until October 20.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Arts: The Kocian Quartet and Welser-Most - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performances of Schumann's oratorio Scenes from Goethe's Faust are rare, so
it was an excellent choice for the 'Deutsche Romantik' series on the South
Bank. So was the plan of having the American Thomas Hampson sing Faust; his
big, resplendent voice should have dominated the first two parts of the
work, the quasi-dramatic ones. It was bad luck that Hampson fell ill just
days before the London Philharmonic concert on Monday.
In the event, listeners to the live broadcast on Radio 3 probably heard the
piece to better advantage than those of us in the Festival Hall. Hampson's
replacement was Simon Keenlyside, who - like Nicholas Folwell in Weber's
Euryanthe on the previous evening - had bravely agreed to learn the part at
short notice. It was understandable, but disappointing, that his attractive,
intelligently used baritone lacked the authority to impose itself on the
music.
The conductor Franz Welser-Most did little to accommodate him, either by way
of trimming back the orchestral sound or mitigating his tempi, which tended
to be doggedly brisk. Margaret Price's Gretchen and Kurt Rydl's
Mephistopheles were safe and strong, but Ian Bostridge was another
souffrant, and after a plucky start his Ariel simply ran out of voice. The
rest of the solo team were good, and the London Philharmonic Choir tolerably
secure; the boys' chorus sounded frail.
For Part 3, the elevated 'Chorus Mysticus' that Mahler was to set so much
more dramatically in his Eighth Symphony, Welser-Most at last relaxed a
little. So did his singers: Keenlyside's Doctor Marianus was fine and
fervent, and each of Goethe's other mystical figures was gracefully sung. We
began to appreciate Schumann's curiously gentle lyricism better.
That was rather late, however. We had been taken at a jog-trot through much
of the earlier music (composed later, in fact), with little chance to dwell
upon its luminous moments. Yet hardly anything in the Scenes is 'symphonic';
the various movements are more like expanded mood-pieces.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How much shall circumstances in which a work was created affect our response
to it? Such was the question which might have arisen at the Kocian Quartet's
rivetingly played recital (sponsored by the David Cohen Charitable Trust) at
the Wigmore Hall on Monday, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the
premature deaths of four of Czechoslovakia's most intriguing composers. In
the event, the music was of such fascination that no special pleading was
needed.
All of them were internees in the Nazi-commandeered ghetto of Terezn near
Prague where, to convince outsiders that all was well in the Jewish
community, the authorities promoted vigorous artistic activity. Ironically,
this 'liberal attitude' was the catalyst to music of a radicalism outlawed
in Germany itself and of a quality comparable to that of their
contemporaries Schoenberg, Bartok and Janacek.
Of the four the best known is probably the Polish-born Viktor Ullmann. His
opera The Emperor of Atlantis was performed in London only a year or two
back and his Third String Quartet fully confirmed the favourable impression
made then. Like Pavel Haas' more expansive Third String Quartet with which
it was paired in the concert's second half, Ullmann's quartet is pervaded by
that wistful Viennese weltschmerz found in Mahler and early Schoenberg, yet
in its quixotic reversals of mood and sardonic humour offers something
distinctly personal and unnerving.
So too does the Trio of Gideon Klein, only 26 when he died, a concise,
folk-inflected study a la Bartok. Its cool objectivity seems to belie the
crisis situation of its origins, a characteristic of Hans Krasa's sometimes
quirky Theme with Variations. Strangely perhaps, the greatest emotional
intensity was to be heard not from the Terezn period but in music composed
over 20 years earlier, Krasa's String Quartet of 1921, an ambitious
summation of all the main compositional trends of its time. With its
post-modernish references to the Brahms 'Lullaby' and 'Silent Night' it
might have been written yesterday.

PULP FICTION (18) Quentin Tarantino
THE CLIENT (15) Joel Schumacher
L'ENFER (15) Claude Chabrol
THREESOME (18) Andrew Fleming
On some days a critic wonders if his head is wound on the right way. The
consensus among reviewers of Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction seems to be
that the new film is even more violent than his Reservoir Dogs, 'but at
least it is funny.'
Pardon me while I clutch at comprehension. You mean: it is all right to
watch people being shot, stabbed, tortured, sodomised or drug-injected if we
laugh at it, but not if we take it seriously?
When Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, my shaking pen
recorded the view that this was 'another shameful crawl to Hollywood' from a
festival not for the first time thus grovelling. But the jury decision also
reflected popular response. The Palais audience roared happily -
frighteningly happily - as Pulp Fiction screeched and gear-shifted through
its 2 1/2 -hour, three-stories-in-one traffic of underworld hit men and
hoodlums.
It roared when gangster's moll Uma Thurman, having OD'd on heroin, has a
needleful of adrenalin stabbed into her chest by desperate escort-bodyguard
John Travolta, anxious that she should not die while he is on the job. It
roared when a kidnapped young black has his brains scattered over a car
thanks to Travolta's slippery trigger finger. And it giggled when boxer
Bruce Willis, running from his boss after refusing to throw an important
fight, is captured by a sodomitic, weapon-wielding pawnshop owner and
friend.
Let us be clear. Tarantino is a brilliant talent. Reservoir Dogs was scary
perfection as a thriller: disturbing in the right way, morally neutral in
the right way. (Film-makers should play artist and storyteller not judge or
jury.) And his screenplays for other directors  - True Romance, Natural Born
Killers - are piecing together an epic psychopathology of violence for
America, a country asking for one.
Pulp Fiction is brilliant too. But it is a different brilliance: a
dribbling, prolix, self-gratifying, one-handed brilliance. Tarantino's
dialogue is still the best in American cinema, wild with colloquialism,
non-sequitur and the shared references of a pop-culture generation. But in
earlier films this dialogue served a pressure-chamber exploration of
character as well as the mad lore and logic of the criminal mind.
In Pulp Fiction the verbal riffs - on everything from French names for
hamburgers to the sexual implications of a foot massage - are just that.
Swirls of pretty inanity: as disembodied from each other as are the film's
own sundered story-sections. It is daring to show one leading character's
death and then jump to another tale in which the same character is alive. It
says 'up yours' to the Aristotelian unities. But it also says 'up yours' to
an audience now so jaded that it is prostrate and giggling in the film's
back seat. It no longer cares where the vehicle is going so long as the
shootings and expletives happen.
The film opens and closes with a sequence in a diner in which Tim Roth and
Amanda Plummer play two debut crooks planning a hold-up. The diner setting
is a misfortune. It recalls another movie: it reminds us that Barry Levinson
in Diner pioneered this Daft Language Of The Young syndrome years ago and
also gave us characters who had minds, lives and feelings. Pulp Fiction is a
joyride from nowhere to nowhere, with a man at the wheel who could be the
director with the best sense of direction in America.
Should you see Pulp Fiction? Yes, you still should. It is 150 minutes of
talent in search of a signpost.
The Client, by contrast, is all signposts and no talent. Taking a John
Grisham bestseller about a frightened boy witness in a murder trial, who
tries to stay mum while being cajoled by the FBI and menaced by the Mafia,
director Joel Schumacher (Cousins, Flatliners) approaches the plot's twists
and turns like a first-time cab driver struggling with his A-to-Z.
This way for the boy's meeting with caring, motherly lawyer Susan Sarandon,
who agrees to take his case for the one crumpled dollar in his pocket. (Can
I have her business address?) This way for the first glimpse of the barking,
self-righteous FBI man played by Tommy Lee Jones: an actor who seems to be
spending his entire career (see The Fugitive, Natural Born Killers) stomping
down corridors spraying orders at people. And this way - into the lawyer's
car and off into the night  - for the climax in a boatshed where most of the
main cast meet over the dead body under the concrete.
Dr Johnson once said that if a play is set in the king's bedroom, then
everyone must have his business in the king's bedroom. I felt much the same
about this boatshed. But by this point in a sluggish, pedestrian thriller I
was glad for the company and the sense that everything was about to be over.
Claude Chabrol's L'Enfer, based on an uncompleted movie project by
Henri-Georges Clouzot of The Wages Of Fear (he died six days into shooting
in 1964), is brilliantly acted by Francois Cluzet. He plays a young husband
eaten up - almost literally to judge by the pale, thinning skin and
deepening facial faultlines - by irrational jealousy of his beautiful wife
(Emmanuelle Beart).
Cluzet, who was the young musician in Round Midnight, makes the
near-impossible role irresistible. He is required to hear voices, talk into
mirrors, throw tantrums at his guests (he runs a small country hotel) and do
physical damage to himself and his wife. Looking at my notes later, I saw
the comment: 'Clearly needs professional help.' But this refers to the
character, not Cluzet's performance. L'Enfer, 30 years after it was penned,
has fallen foul of an age when psychiatry would seem the answer to a clear
case of clinical disturbance.
Chabrol's direction does not help the suspension of disbelief. It is
nervously poised between sly naturalism - his favoured mode in masterworks
like Le Boucher and La Femme Infidele - and the half-hearted expressionism
that the material seems to solicit. A surreally stark hotel corridor (out of
1950s film noir); sudden blackouts between scenes; or the shot of a
chair-slumped Cluzet reflected in the rectangular mirror over a mantelpiece,
looking for all the world like a parody portrait-painting: 'Whistler's Mad
Uncle', perhaps.
What the film needed was a coherent visual strategy. Or even - given the
grim relentlessness of the subject - a telling subplot to provide variety as
well as an oblique second perspective on the theme.
But better Chabrol's Hell than the Hollywood Heaven of Andrew Fleming's
Threesome. This story's triangular complications - two college boys and the
girl accidentally assigned the second bedroom in their campus duplex - are
solved by some pathetic, sanitised stabs at bisexuality. Boy one (Stephen
Baldwin) fancies girl (Lara Flynn Boyle); girl fancies boy two (Josh
Charles); boy two fancies boy one.
Audience fancies exit door. While the gay boy gets the amatory short straw -
basically, of course, he is a mixed-up heterosexual - the others climb into
bed for much pawing, cooing and platitudinising, none of which would offend
Aunt Edna.
French classics are an option when all else fails. Bresson's 1974 Lancelot
Du Lac (PG, Everyman Hampstead) is an achingly beautiful film, despite some
clunk-clank combat scenes that may summon irreverent thought of Monty
Python. And Cocteau's 1950 Orphee (PG, National Film Theatre) is still the
greatest of all films that explore and proudly exhibit that illusionist
looking-glass we call cinema.

The move away from serious analysis in television journalism and towards
'human interest' material has turned into a trot. Stand by for the gallop.
BBC1 begins another series of Children's Hospital which has the attractions
of any medical series (high drama, bags of emotion) but also the special
advantages that come with child patients: they look appealing and tend to
die less often than the elderly (8.00). Blues And Twos is yet another of the
rash of ambulance-chasing series which have burst out all over television.
Today they chase paramedic Allan Norman as he races around London on a
motorbike reaching casualties much quicker than a four-wheeled ambulance.
Ironically he drives to work on an 80cc Yamaha but for the job he rides a
Honda 1100 (8.30 ITV). Inside Story offers yet another report on cosmetic
surgery; a subject upon which Alan Whicker made the definitive programme
years ago (10.00 BBC1). Prostitute is the last of a three-part French series
about 'the oldest profession' (11.05 C4). On second thoughts perhaps we are
already seeing the gallop.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A battle over 7m
merchants - US advertisers' public feuds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Comparative advertising, they call it: promoting your products by doing down
a rival's. But in the US, where the practice seems to have taken a
particularly nasty turn, one recent campaign might better be described as a
bare-knuckle fight.
For the last three weeks Visa International and American Express, two of the
world's biggest payment card organisations, have been conducting a public
slanging match in which they have used full-page newspaper advertisements to
abuse one another's products.
The story started last month when American Express, famous for its charge
cards, decided to launch an assault on the market with a new product called
the Optima True Grace card.
In advertisements, American Express said Optima True Grace offered an
advantage unavailable to holders of other credit cards: an interest-free
grace period on new purchases even if the monthly bill was not paid in full.
Most cards, it said, charged interest from the moment of purchase if holders
did not pay off the full balance.
At the end of September, Visa started hitting back. In newspaper
advertisements across the US, it yelled: 'American Express is offering you a
new credit card, but you don't have to accept it. Heck, 7m merchants don't'
In smaller type beneath the main message, it said 7m merchants accepted the
Visa card that did not accept Optima True Grace.
After a couple of weeks, American Express's patience snapped. It started
running full-page counterblasts to the Visa campaign, asking: 'Why is Visa
incorrectly claiming 7m more merchants than American Express? (We challenge
Visa to name them.) Answer: So you won't notice the Dollars 1.5bn
unnecessary interest they charge you.'
Both sides vigorously defend their advertisements. Visa says it will be
happy to name the 7m merchants which do not accept American Express if
American Express will pay for the space. American Express says this is a red
herring because most Visa agents are outside the US and have never seen, nor
will ever see, an American. The real issue, it says, is the interest
charges.
'We are firing a missile directly into Visa's home base. We are going right
after its market. Visa's scared as hell about it. That's what these ads are
about,' says American Express's Thomas Ryder, president, establishment
services worldwide.
One obvious drawback of responding to a rival's advertising claims in this
way is that it can draw attention to a product that would otherwise have
gone unnoticed. An increasingly popular alternative is to lob a lawsuit at
the offending party.
Last week Hertz, the car rental company, employed the technique in an
attempt to stop its rival Avis from running a television commercial
promoting an airport valet service. The Avis advertisements offer a
chauffeur-driven lift from car rental parking lots to airport terminals
across the US, but Hertz's suit says many airports do not allow such a
service because it adds to congestion. Avis has filed a counter-claim.
Even so, the public name-calling does seem to have become unusually loud of
late. In another newspaper advertisement, AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications
company, has been contradicting the claims made by rival MCI Communications
for a discount calling plan, saying: 'You never save 40 per cent off your
bill. (You actually save an average of only 13 per cent).'
The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus,
the US industry's self-regulating body, says the outbreak is probably
coincidental rather than indicative of a trend. Debra Goldstein, the
division's acting director, says opinions remain divided about whether
comparative advertising provides the consumer with additional valid
information or whether it simply gives competitors free advertising time.
'There are pros and cons on both sides,' Goldstein says. 'But many
advertisers may feel it just turns the consumer off, publicly airing a feud.
No one wants to listen to that.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ratings rumpus -
Controversy in Japan over new plans for monitoring television viewing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent announcement by AC Nielsen Japan, the Japanese arm of the US
marketing and television ratings group, is causing havoc among the country's
television and advertising communities.
At issue are the company's plans to launch next month a television ratings
system using the so-called people meter, which measures ratings based on
individual viewers' opinions.
Although Japan's television advertising market is the second largest in the
world, with turnover last year totalling Y1,589bn (Pounds 10bn), Japan is
one of the few countries where television commercial rates are still based
on household ratings.
Nielsen's announcement has stoked up the debate between the country's
corporate advertisers, which are eager for more detailed and timely
information, and the television networks, which are trying to stop the move.
Companies' needs for more detailed data on who is watching what have been
heightened by the downturn in Japanese corporate earnings and lower
advertising expenditure. 'Our advertising budget has fallen around 30 per
cent since 1990, so we would be interested in getting information on
individual viewers,' says Toyota Motor, the leading car maker.
Under the household ratings system, automated data is relayed from 3,600
households across the nation. But the information does not help companies
that want to target consumers of particular age or gender group. 'In an age
where a household has about four television sets, household-based ratings
are really of no use,' says Shiseido, the country's largest cosmetics
company and a leading advertiser.
The system is supplemented by individual ratings based on diaries in which
viewers indicate the channels they watch. However, the Japan Advertisers'
Association (JAA) claims the figures are useless because the diaries are
filled in during just one week a month and rely heavily on viewers'
memories.
Nielsen's people meter, by contrast, requires every viewer to push a button
on top of the TV set each time he or she watches television. Each member of
a 'Nielsen family' will have a separate button and a heat sensor will warn
viewers by beeping if the number of buttons pushed and the number of people
in front of the set do not match.
The television networks, meanwhile, which are also irritated that Nielsen
had failed to consult them before its announcement, argue that the people
meter is an imperfect tool, and refer to developments in the US, where
American networks are questioning the system's accuracy. They further argue
that the people meter still relies on the viewers' diligence to press the
machine's buttons.
According to Brian Roberts, managing director of AGB Television, the company
that operates a 'people meter' for the BBC and ITV in the UK very similar to
Nielsen's controversial Japanese model, much depends on how scientifically
the sample of television viewers is selected and how well these viewers are
instructed in how to use the meter.
AGB is now also able to log 'time-shifted' programmes on its model of the
people meter. 'If you record a programme and play it back within seven days,
our clever probes pick that up,' he says. Official British viewing figures
now include this 'off-air' viewing.
The main problem in monitoring television viewing in the future is going to
be keeping track of which station a set is tuned to - with the proliferation
of cable channels, this is already a problem in the US.
AGB Television recently unveiled a new 'picture-matching' system that will
work by collecting samples of digitised television pictures, rather than
relying on measuring the frequency of the signal - an increasingly complex
task, with so many channels now in existence and frequent changes in
frequencies.
The ultimate dream of advertisers must be 'passive metering' - a machine
that will be able to tell for itself who is sitting in front of the TV.
Roberts believes that this technology will be expensive to develop and is
still some way off.
He also considers that passive metering would give researchers little more
information than they get now with the people meter, and that the technology
could be seen as unacceptably like having Big Brother in the homes of sample
viewers.
The issue in Japan, however, is more than just a simple technological
debate. Behind the wrangling is an attempt to prise open the ratings market,
which is effectively controlled by the television networks, by Dentsu and
Hakuhodo, the two largest advertising agencies, and by Video Research, the
ratings agency which has a virtual monopoly in its field.
Given the influence that ratings have over programme schedules and
advertisement rates - not to mention expensive ratings service fees -
corporate advertisers are happy to lend their support. Foreign advertising
agencies, trying to gain a foothold, are also behind the move.
For Nielsen, the move is a big step in trying to regain a foothold in the
ratings business. Although the company first introduced to Japan the concept
of television ratings in 1960, it lost out when Video Research was set up by
the networks and advertising agencies two years later.
There is also much at stake for the advertisers, which have taken a risk by
confronting Dentsu and Hakuhodo. According to brokers James Capel in Tokyo,
these two handle more than one-third of all advertising budgets in Japan.
'To sever a relationship with the two agencies will have grave repercussions
since they usually control the best advertising slots and have a lot of
information which we would miss out on,' says an advertiser.
For many companies, television remains the most effective medium to reach
consumers. The negotiations between the networks and advertisers have so far
been handled delicately.
Akihiro Ito, secretary-general of the JAA, says the association will now
stand back and wait for the outcome of Nielson's launch next month.
However, the broadcasting association - which has so far failed to dissuade
Nielson - plans to keep up the pressure and will announce a statement of its
opposition before the launch of the people meter.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Technology - Steel Takes on Aluminium: Back in the frame for
building / Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great steel skeletons that thrust towards the New York sky epitomise the
North American building site. Steel frames are a must for constructing
office blocks, industrial units and residential flats in the US. But this is
not so for much of western Europe where reinforced concrete is preferred for
multi-storey buildings in many countries
The exceptions are in the UK and Sweden where use of constructional steel
has risen sharply over the past decade, supported by new building design
techniques and developments in fire resistant paints and sprays for steel
products.
Now European steel producers are working hard to increase market share in
countries such as France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and
Italy. They estimate that if steel frames were used as widely in other
European countries as in Sweden and Britain, constructional steel demand
would increase by 2.8m tonnes a year, a rise of 45 per cent.
Some 57 per cent of multi-storey buildings in the UK and 90 per cent of
single-storey factories and warehouses were estimated by British Steel in
1991-92 to have been constructed with steel frames. In Sweden the
corresponding proportions were 50 per cent and 80 per cent. In Germany they
were 11 per cent and 20-25 per cent and in Italy 11 per cent and 20 per
cent.
Marketing campaigns have been launched in these countries by the large
European steel producers and fabricators. These emphasise the speed and
simplicity of using steel as a building material, the relative fall in the
price of the metal and the introduction of new European building codes on
fire protection that they hope will overcome some of the prejudices of
developers against steel frames.
Concern that steel loses strength when heated and therefore responds less
well in big fires than reinforced concrete has held back development of
steel in Europe.
EU building codes developed by CEN, the European standards institute, will
provide developers with guidance on the most efficient and economic fire
prevention regimes for steel-framed buildings. Also, much work has gone into
developing fire-resistant paints and sprays that can be applied to steel
beams.
Derek Tordoff, director of the British Constructional Steelwork Association,
says: 'European developers traditionally have thought that steel needed to
be covered by concrete to be protected properly.'
Retardants now include intumescent paints that expand when heated into a
thick coating that insulates the steel from heat and flames. Beams and
pillars can also be covered by a mineral-based vermiculite spray that
expands when heated and is widely used for insulation.
Improvements in construction design aided by computers have made it much
easier for architects to solve problems by design rather than by changing
one material for another.
At its best steel construction should be as simple as building in Lego.
Ready to assemble prefabricated parts, cut perfectly to fit, need to arrive
on site in the right order and with the appropriate fastenings.
Builders in North America have become accustomed to constructing with a
standard range of components, which can be assembled in various imaginative
designs, but can be supplied by any one of a large number of manufacturers.
Delivery problems are overcome quickly by switching suppliers while
sub-contractors are content to handle products they are accustomed to
without having to develop special techniques and procedures.
However, concrete has supporters too, and has also benefited from
increasingly sophisticated design and prefabrication techniques.
Steel is used alongside concrete for floors and cladding, and new design
techniques have enabled developers to reduce the thickness, and therefore
the cost, of the concrete flooring that sits on steel beams.
Europe is a big prize. British Steel and the British Constructional
Steelwork Association have combined with other large European steel
producers and fabricators to develop common solutions and data on technical
issues.
Advisory teams of structural engineers have been established in countries
such as France and Germany, with financial support from the Eurofer Steel
Producers, to make design and technical support available to smaller
countries.
Production of constructional steelwork in western Europe is expected to be
about 5.7m tonnes this year - about the same level as last year but 8 per
cent below 1992 levels and 19 per cent lower than during 1990.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Technology - Steel Takes on Aluminium: Clash of two metals -
How the world's steel industry is fighting back against aluminium and other
rivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tucked away in a luxury Colorado Springs hotel in October, some 350
executives from the world's big steelmakers had the chance to view some
interesting slides brought along by colleague Jeff Edington.
These were no holiday snaps. Edington, British Steel's executive director
for technology, was showing delegates at the annual International Iron and
Steel Institute conference the wings from a Hawker Harrier jumpjet fighter
and the tailfin of an Airbus 330.
In both cases, carbon fibre (a composite material challenging both steel and
aluminium) had replaced aluminium as the material used. Edington's point was
that steel, the world's most versatile structural material, has no automatic
right to its position in the market place.
'Our product is a low cost, highly sophisticated material with a lot of
development potential left in it. The market is ours to lose. If we lose it,
we can only blame ourselves for lack of technical and business creativity
and innovation,' he says.
The upbeat outlook of Edington and other steel industry executives about the
future of their product might seem to be misplaced. The public perception of
steel is of an industry in decline, twisted by subsidies, wracked by
controversy over job cuts, and tarnished with an old-fashioned image.
Some in the industry admit they have let producers of rival materials,
notably aluminium, gain too much ground in recent years, and may have been
distracted by their own industrial problems from promoting their products
more effectively, and developing new markets.
Now, with steel demand rising, they have a chance to prove the public
perception of the industry wrong. Lenhard Holschuh, the institute's
secretary general, predicts world consumption of steel will rise by 2.3 per
cent and 3.4 per cent this year and next, and by an average 2.8 per cent a
year to reach an unprecedented 750m tonnes in 2000.
Some observers believe this may be too optimistic, although there is general
agreement that much of the increased demand will come from developing
countries. Nearly half of the steel consumed in 2000 will be used in Asia,
says Holschuh.
Apart from the geographical factors, achieving these growth predictions will
depend critically on the success of some of the product development and
marketing initiatives, involving both steelmakers and users, currently under
way.
The initiatives highlighted at Colorado Springs show how steel-makers are
working to defend their patch in the three key industrial battlegrounds:
In the automotive sector, an international industry consortium of about 30
steel producers is designing an ultra-lightweight steel car body.
In packaging, European steel-makers are co-operating to develop an all-steel
beverage can made from a special, lightweight high-strength steel (see
accompanying article).
In construction, some steelmakers are trying with considerable success to
convince architects to use steel frames rather than concrete in office and
industrial buildings. Others are battling with steel-producing rivals to
supply the reinforcing bar or welded mesh on which the concrete depends.
In the US, one of the biggest recent success stories for steel-makers has
come in the residential housing market, says John Ewing, US Steel's managing
director for business development.
In 1991 just a few hundred steel-framed homes were built in North America.
But a task force formed by the American Iron and Steel Institute identified
an opportunity because of problems with materials, such as the rising cost
and falling quality of lumber, and environmental issues raised by forestry
and scrap. Steel, in contrast, can boast that it is fully recyclable.
Last year, about 13,000 new homes in North America used all-steel frames,
and another 80,000 used steel in interior walls, so steel's penetration is
still tiny compared with the 1.3m housing starts in the US alone last year.
Ewing's target is for 25 per cent of all new homes to use steel framing in
1997 and 6 per cent to use steel roofing.
The lesson is that to achieve business success the steel industry does not
always have to develop new grades of steel - such as the modern types of
steel wire that allow suspension bridge spans now to be increased to nearly
2km, or the many new grades of coated steels used in car bodies.
Edington believes a 'system solution' will become increasingly important.
Steelmakers must think of their products as part of an engineered system
consisting of various materials that together give customers value, he says.
The system would have to cope with recycling.
Two other important driving forces for the steel industry, he says, are
environmental pollution arising from using the end-product, most notably in
the car industry, and process automation aimed at reducing costs and
improving the quality of the final product.
In can-making, for example, production rates are increasing and decoration
in up to six colours is added at 1,800 cans a minute, so dimensional
accuracy and surface finish are paramount. In many markets, says Edington,
accuracy and surface quality will have to continue to be improved.
Outside the big three industrial markets, steel has recently had mixed
fortunes. In white goods, the development of pre-painted and laminated
steels, and repeated quality improvements are hailed by steelmakers as
factors enabling them to win the battle with materials such as plastics.
The challenge for the steel industry will be to cope with customers' demands
for increasingly diversified and functionally sophisticated steel, but still
generate a profit, says Minoru Tanaka, executive vice-president at Nippon
Steel. This has led the Japanese steel industry to reassess its approach to
quality and performance standards, producing reasonably-priced products that
perform adequately rather than ex-ceed the minimum required quality.
In railway rolling stock, aluminium has become the standard material for
mainline carriages such as Germany's ICE high-speed trains. 'It's lighter,
and the image of the material seems to be more modern,' says Rolf Schraut,
head of research and development at Duewag, the Siemens rolling-stock
subsidiary.
However, stainless steel producers are fighting back. One, Germany's Krupp
Nirosta, has developed a stainless steel for the side wall of a high-speed
train, working in co-operation with Duewag and Deutsche Bahn. It says it has
the same rigidity and weight as a wall made of aluminium.

The motor industry urgently needs lighter, stronger materials to meet
demands for more economical and environmentally-cleaner vehicles. The
lighter the car, the less fuel it consumes and the smaller the amount of
pollutants it emits.
But manufacturers are also being pulled in another direction. Legislators
want more safety features, such as airbags and side-impact anti-intrusion
bars. Consumers increasingly want air-conditioning, compact disc systems and
other comfort features. These add weight - and lots of it.
The first Volkswagen Golf of the early 1970s weighed on average 750 kg.
Thanks to all its extra systems, today's Golf weighs around 1,000 kg.
If VW could pare the car's weight back to 1974 levels while retaining modern
convenience and safety features, the 1994 Golf would travel about 17 per
cent further on each gallon.
Volkswagen's executive cars division, Audi, jolted the world steel industry
with its launch earlier this year of the A8, a luxury car with an
all-aluminium bodyshell comprising a skeleton-like frame made of extrusions
and castings, clad in pressed aluminium panels. The body structure is said
to be nearly 40 per cent lighter than the steel equivalent.
Audi and its partner Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) have installed
specialised production facilities allowing output of up to 30,000 cars a
year.
More disconcerting yet for steel makers is that VW/Audi says it sees no
reason why even high-volume cars such as the Golf should not have aluminium
bodies early next century, while Alcoa says it is prepared to spend Dollars
1bn (Pounds 600m) or more on a partnership with any car maker seeking to
produce aluminium-bodied cars in annual volumes of 100,000 units or more.
In North America major car makers such as Ford are also pressing ahead with
development programmes for aluminium-bodied cars. In addition, a consortium
of more than 20 steel-makers from around the world has embarked on a
collaborative project aimed at designing the lightest possible steel
bodyshell for cars. It has engaged Porsche Engineering Services, the US
consultancy engineering arm of the German sports car maker, to lead the
project, which is setting out to show that a 20 per cent weight saving in a
steel bodyshell can be achieved by optimising design using current pressing
and body-welding systems, and 35 per cent by designing from scratch and
utilising advanced technology.
Even though VW/Audi has such a big commitment to aluminium body structures,
it is keeping its options open. It is collaborating with Mercedes-Benz, BMW
and the German and French steel industries in their own parallel programme
to see whether thin, high-strength steels can achieve the same weight saving
as aluminium, but at lower cost and using conventional pressing and welding
equipment. If it can be demonstrated clearly that this is so, steel makers
say they believe other steel-favouring factors should prove decisive: easy
repairability within an established repair infrastructure; easier
paintability; and easier and cheaper recycling.
A recent report by the Iron and Steel Institute maintains that whereas
automotive steels are routinely shredded, melted and reformed into new
products, aluminium body parts comprise different alloys with low tolerance
both towards each other and outside contaminants, and so have to be recycled
separately or downgraded into lower value products.
In terms of energy conservation alone, the implications of even a 20 per
cent cut in body weight are enormous. Applied across the world car
population, according to Ludwig Hamm, Porsche's head of body engineering,
fuel savings would equal the annual consumption of more than 6m cars.
It is not only in the area of weight saving that steel makers are seeking to
preserve their automotive markets. Steel makers have been investing heavily
in mills to produce a variety of coated steels. A major part of this
investment, around Dollars 25bn worldwide, has gone into zinc coating lines.
What began, in the 1960s, as a limited supply to the automotive industry of
hot-dipped galvanised sheet for use in exposed underbody parts has grown
into the wholesale supply of steels with deep two-sided coatings.
The approach has helped to roll back part of the challenge to steel from the
plastic composites sector, much of whose appeal has rested on its
non-corroding qualities but which continues to suffer considerable problems
of recyclability.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Technology - Steel Takes on Aluminium: Promoting a can-do
approach / Beverage cans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Aluminium is a relatively young metal that has established itself by taking
over from traditional materials. It has replaced wood and steel in windows
and cladding, copper in electrical cable and, above all, substitutes for
steel in beverage cans.
In the US, 95bn cans of beer or soft drinks are consumed every year, a can a
day for every man, woman and child. And 99 per cent of the cans are made of
aluminium where once they were made of steel. This has left the aluminium
industry with a problem: about 10 per cent of global demand for its metal
comes from one product in one country. So it is spending heavily to spread
the gospel of the aluminium beverage can around the world.
To promote the use of aluminium cans outside the US, the industry leans
heavily on its green credentials, claiming that the cans may be recycled on
a closed loop system (from cans to scrap and back to cans again). The
relatively high value of aluminium as scrap - the cans are worth six to 20
times more than any other used packaging material and are the most valuable
used package found in household waste - enables the industry to spread the
word that can-recycling gives collectors a decent income.
Last year, for example, the US aluminium industry is estimated to have paid
Dollars 900m for used cans, money that benefited individuals, schools,
church scout troops and so on. This is not simply altruism - the industry
needs this recycled metal because it is a cheap raw material for new cans.
As much as 95 per cent of the energy needed to produce new aluminium is
saved by recycling old metal because aluminium 'stores' energy. The average
smelter uses as much power as a town of 500,000 people to produce new
aluminium. On top of that, there are capital savings because a re-melting
plant costs only one-tenth as much as a smelter.
Steel producers argue that the high cost of new aluminium means it makes
economic sense to use aluminium cans only if more than 60 per cent of them
are recycled. Few markets achieve this level.
In the US the recycling rate is about 66 per cent which means that last year
roughly 600,000 tonnes of aluminium worth about Dollars 900m escaped,
possibly to be thrown away. In Europe the estimated minimum recycling rate
last year was about 30 per cent.
In Europe aluminium has won only half the available beverage can market and
it is there that the steel industry, perhaps a little late, is fighting back
hardest.
Steel beverage cans are as green as aluminium, the industry's message goes,
mainly because they can be attracted by magnets and are therefore easily
rescued from waste. Cans are selling at roughly the same price - about
Dollars 58 (Pounds 37) per 1,000 - although steel prices could come down
more quickly as it has greater potential for light weighting.
Innovative packages such as British Steel Tinplate's recently-launched
Ecotop can, with a push-button, all-steel, easy-open end could give steel
beverage cans more appeal in consumers' eyes.
John May, marketing manager at British Steel Tinplate, points out that the
US steel industry, when it gave way to aluminium, did not have available the
continuous casting technology the European industry is using to produce
high-quality tinplate today. Recent technological developments in steel-can
making have led to significant energy and materials savings.
Steel beverage cans now have wall thicknesses of less than 0.1mm and are 30
per cent thinner than those made of aluminium. Steel soft drinks cans are 25
per cent lighter than four years ago, yet the industry is developing a steel
can 30 per cent lighter than now , and lighter than aluminium cans on the
market.
Steel suffered a setback recently when Coca-Cola Schweppes, the UK's biggest
soft drinks group, switched its canning lines to aluminium, because of the
metal's lighter weight. Nick Mason at the CRU International consultancy
group says that, as steel is much denser and heavier than aluminium it is
possible to use longer or wider aluminium coils. A typical aluminium coil
will yield 12 cans per width compared with seven from a steel coil. So
nearly twice as many tin plate coils are needed to make the same number of
cans. That means more storage space and more handling, if steel is used.
Nevertheless, May insists his industry does not suffer from a 'siege
mentality' about the beverage can battle which is only one part of the
packaging sector. Steel has about 15 per cent of the UK packaging market and
aluminium 5 per cent. In beverage cans, in the Netherlands 100 per cent are
steel, in France it is 95 per cent and in Belgium 90 per cent. Germany's
market is 85 per cent steel.

FT  20 OCT 94 / People: Plumb to chair UK agricultural lender
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, the biggest long-term lender to
Britain's farmers, has just acquired its third chairman in the last 18
months. Lord Plumb, 69, leader of the Tory MEPs in Strasbourg, has taken the
helm of Britain's only specialised agricultural lender.
Lord Plumb, right, a former president of the National Farmers Union, takes
over from Sir David Walker, following the latter's announcement that he is
resigning as a deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank to become chairman of Morgan
Stanley's European operations. Sir David had replaced Henry Lambert as
chairman, following last year's acquisition of the AMC by Lloyds Bank.
The AMC, set up in 1928, had been owned by the Bank of England and the big
London clearing banks prior to its acquisition by Lloyds. The bank is intent
on expanding its new acquisition and has been strengthening its ties with
the farming community.
Lord Plumb, who had been a director of Lloyds for 15 years, went on the
board following last year's acquisition, joining Sir Simon Gourlay, another
ex-president of the NFU, and Lord Selborne, who farms 2,500 acres in
Hampshire and is the government's chief adviser on nature conservation.
Lord Selborne, 54, managing director of the Blackmoor Estate and a trustee
of the Royal Agricultural Society, joined the AMC board in 1990 as the
nominee of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary
of State for Wales.
He was appointed a non-executive director of Lloyds Bank last July.
In the wake of Sir David's departure, Lord Selborne has been appointed
deputy chairman of AMC, and Michael Thompson, a former deputy chief
executive of Lloyds Bank, has also joined the board.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kelvin Bray has been appointed managing director of GEC Alsthom's power
generation division, created this month to allow the Anglo-French company to
respond more effectively and rapidly to changes in the world market.
In his new role Bray, right, one of the best-known names in Europe's gas
turbine industry, is running by far the largest of GEC Alsthom's divisions,
which the reorganisation has reduced in number from seven to five.
Consequential appointments remain to be made, although GEC Alsthom did say
that Wilhelm Heitmann would continue running the boilers and environmental
systems activities. Bernard Dufour, former head of the old electromechanical
division, has left to join Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine
manufacturer.
Bray, 59, has spent more than 30 years in the gas turbine industry, and was
appointed to the management board of GEC Alsthom in 1990.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jurek Sikorski, business development and marketing director at Proteus
International, has been promoted to chief executive just five months after
joining the biotechnology company.
The move follows the group's decision to accelerate the search for
commercial applications for some of its 30 products under development.
Sikorsky, 43, is expected to use experience gained at Smith and Nephew - the
healthcare group where he was international marketing director - to form
more collaborative ventures with pharmaceutical companies, offseting the
cost of bringing products to market.
Of those products, Proteus has high hopes for Adjuvant - its immune system
booster for treating arthritis - and a new diagnostic test for Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy, commonly known as mad cow disease, in live
cattle.
Proteus is discussing development programmes for Adjuvant with nine
pharmaceutical companies, while an animal health company is said to be
interested in manufacturing and marketing the BSE test.
Kevin Gilmore, executive chairman, said Sikorski - son of a Polish immigrant
and one-time professional footballer with Swindon Town - was 'ideally
placed' to push the products forward.
'Jurek will not only accelerate our development programmes but help us
replace our entrepreneurial style with the kind of structured line
management we now need,' he added.
John Pool, Proteus's 50-year-old managing director, has been named deputy
chairman but will continue to oversee the group's research and development
arm.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Accountancy Column: Insolvency faces challenge of
privatisation / A look in detail at the Stoy Hayward report into contracting
out the work of Official Receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stoy Hayward report on the future of the Insolvency Service has created
considerable excitement among UK accountants, not least because the word
insolvency concentrates the mind of the profession wonderfully.
Stoy's were asked last year by the Department of Trade and Industry to study
options for privatisation of the service, which is a DTI agency dealing with
financial failure and tackling fraud in insolvency.
The conclusion of the report, to contract out part of the service to the
private sector, if backed by ministers and sanctioned by parliament, will
determine the future of insolvency practice and contribute to the debate on
contracting-out in government services.
The lather generated over the 'publication' of the report has been
exacerbated by difficulties in obtaining the document and the understandable
anxieties of those whose livelihoods may be at stake.
The report has been lodged in the House of Commons library and is now being
considered by the Department of Trade and Industry. Meanwhile, the
Deregulation and Contracting Out Bill, which would enable the
contracting-out option identified in the report to go ahead, is being
debated by the Lords.
While the government may well see this as an example of due process, others
harbour suspicions that the die has already been cast. Indeed, Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has instructed officials to prepare
the ground for the preferred option. That option is simple. The report
recommends that the private sector, in the guise of Licenced Insolvency
Practitioners (IPs), should take on cases normally dealt with by Official
Receivers after a court order has been made - in other words at the start of
the process.
The arguments for contracting out are strong. They centre on the need to
improve efficiency by cutting costs, and the desirability of shifting
so-called clerical duties away from the Official Receiver. This would leave
the service free to pursue malpractice and fraud, and protect the public.
Stoy's estimates that opening up the business for competition would, under
the preferred option, mean putting out tenders for work which currently
costs the Insolvency Service Pounds 31m a year.
IPs already deal with the more lucrative voluntary liquidations which make
up about 60 per cent of all failures. There are about 2,000 licenced IPs and
most are accountants. The Licenced Practitioners Association estimates that
600 of these form an active core group. There are between 100 and 200 firms
scattered across the country with an IP partner, while an average Big Six
accountancy firm might have 45 IPs.
Stoy's admits that the preferred option is a 'challenging option'. It does
in fact contain inherent potential problems. For example, its most vital
element, the level of fees charged, will have to be tested in a pilot
tendering scheme.
The report concludes: 'Definitive testing can only be achieved by proceeding
to a formal tendering exercise which involves the preparation of detailed
specifications and the issue of invitations to tender.'
It recognises that taking the preferred option would mean IPs becoming
involved in the preparatory work of cases which might end in prosecution.
How effective would investigations be if started in the public sector but
finished in the private sector?
Stoy's conclusions are blunt: 'If this interface does not work well, the
investigations of the OR would be impaired.'
The report also notes IPs would have a 'substantial role' in setting
standards and monitoring them even within their 'clerical' duties. As one IP
points out: in the eyes of many who have spent their careers working in
insolvency, this would be like privatising part of the judiciary.
At the heart of the report is the issue of fees. Unfortunately two volumes
of information collated by Stoy's have not been published with the main
report.
This is, understandably, due to the sensitive competitive nature of the
information. But there are plenty of clues.
Stoy's approached 78 potential clients and obtained quotes from IPs which
were close to the costs currently incurred by the service. 'In discussions
some IPs expressed the belief that they could get below the Official
Receiver's current costs. This gives confidence that, under formal tendering
conditions in an open market, fees per case could be driven down to levels
which would deliver value for money,' says the report.
Under the preferred option Stoy's estimates that in a company failure in
London the insolvency service's remaining work on the case would cost Pounds
1,449 - leaving the cost of the work left to contractors at Pounds 2,746. In
the provinces the costs would be Pounds 1,357 and Pounds 2,259 a case.
Many smaller IPs are worried that if they could not undercut bigger rivals,
especially from the Big Six firms, during the first tendering round, they
might not have the staff or resources to enter the battle when contracts are
again put out for tender. Because the fees would be on a per case basis,
volume is crucial.
There are also worries that a per case culture would reduce the ability of
the service to spot fraud and malpractice. At present the Official Receiver
faced with a heavy case load can choose to divert resources to cases which
appear to merit attention.
While this is said to be an example of a flexible system based on judgment,
some argue that a standard fee per case system in which all cases would be
given equal time would be more equitable: especially to the creditors who
might get some return from the liquidation.
The problem here is that the Official Receiver can shuffle the case load and
keep overall costs down. A system based on standard per case fees would
become extremely costly if the case load went up. When tendering begins the
government would have to set out its criteria and the resolution of the
quantity/quality argument would be crucial.
One other issue requires clarification. Many IPs want to know whether, if
involved in original casework, they would be barred from acting as
liquidators in those cases where companies were found to have significant
assets. The Stoy Hayward report says: 'There may be charges of an unfair
advantage for contractors in cases which are found to have significant
assets.'
There is as yet no news from the DTI about what direction it intends to
take. Its initial response suggests a strong commitment to carry reforms
forward into a pilot tendering process at the very least.
Those who are likely to lobby against the preferred option do have a vested
interest. The Insolvency Service and its 1,500 employees are suspicious of
the proposals and union representatives predict job losses and closures.
Independent and small firm IPs so far see the option as providing an
opportunity for the Big Six to move in on the new business, and gain a
position which might threaten their existing business.
The government will have to judge the benefits of contracting-out and in
particular the increased effectiveness of investigations undertaken by the
Official Receivers.
It has promised to canvass all Official Receivers. Although normally
reticent, they have an opportunity to speak and their response will be
crucial.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: Mandarins try to please the
critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has traditionally been the most powerful - and most often
criticised - of all government departments.
For many its role in economic policy-making is both outdated and
inefficient. Seen in that light yesterday's proposals are the mandarins'
attempt to redefine their role for the modern era, before less sympathetic
members of the government do it for them.
The department has always been a peculiarly British institution, with a
monopoly on all aspects of national economic management not seen elsewhere.
Most other countries tend to divide economic policy-making between a finance
ministry, an economics ministry and a separate budget office for the control
of public spending. The Treasury combines all three roles, as well as
managing civil service pay, regulating financial services and preparing
economic forecasts.
There has been a long-running debate about whether so much power should be
concentrated in the hands of one ministry. Mr Harold (now Lord) Wilson, for
one, attempted to hive off some of its functions to a new Department of
Economic Affairs in 1964 but was eventually forced to return to the old
system after vigorous Treasury resistance.
In spite of the Treasury winning these and other battles with individual
governments, three broad criticisms of its performance have refused to go
away. The first is that its power has given it much of the responsibility
for the damaging 'boom and bust' cycles of UK economic activity since the
early 1970s. Two humiliating events are particularly associated with
Treasury mistakes - the recourse to the International Monetary Fund in 1976
and sterling's departure from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in
September of 1992.
Second, business leaders and others complain of the Treasury's
'anti-industry culture', blaming Treasury tax and spending decisions for the
declining competitiveness of UK manufacturing.
Third, and perhaps most relevant to yesterday's review, is the accusation
that the Treasury has a penny-pinching, short-termist and interfering
approach to the work of other government departments.
Losing control of public spending in the 1970s was a scarring experience.
Many officials drew the lesson that they would have to involve themselves
more deeply in every layer of government to ensure that public spending
never again spiralled out of control. The upshot, however, is that the
Treasury now tries to shadow officials in other departments, duplicating
their activities unnecessarily and, according to many civil servants, too
often meddling in their decisions.
If sterling's exit from the ERM cast doubt on the Treasury's capacity for
macroeconomic management, the civil service reforms of the Major government
have put a question mark over the Treasury's capacity for this kind of
microeconomic supervision.
Yesterday's proposals indicate that the department has seen the need to
reappraise its activities in light of recent experience. The increasing
decentralisation of public-sector pay bargaining and the more powerful
position which the Bank of England has acquired in the past two years might
mean that the Treasury cannot hope to continue performing all its
traditional functions. But Sir Terry Burns, its permanent secretary,
believes the Treasury's more all-encompassing conception can be defended.
The department must change, but Sir Terry believes that reform need not
imply a pared-down ministry along the lines of a Continental-style finance
ministry. He believes that, in spite of recent events, the Treasury should
not remodel itself as merely the finance department of UK plc. Rather, it
must remain the head office for the economy.
Sir Terry outlined this vision of the Treasury in a speech given earlier
this year. The great advantage which the Treasury had, he said, lay in its
freedom from outside pressures in its analysis of government activities.
'Most departments have their own special interest groups and serving those
groups can inhibit them in their attitude to change. The Treasury, by
contrast, serves no special interest group, which gives it the freedom to
promote change and to protect the dispersed interests of consumers and
taxpayers.'
Yesterday saw the Treasury apply both these precepts to its own activities.
It remains to be seen whether the new arrangement will satisfy the critics.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: Treasury cuts herald Whitehall
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcement of a radical transformation in the role and
staffing of the Treasury could mark a defining moment in the history of
Britain's civil service.
The Treasury is at the pinnacle of the Whitehall pyramid. Few doubt that
with the reform starting there, pressure in Whitehall to slash senior posts
and reshape departments will become irresistible.
The aim of the Whitehall reform programme was set out in July's white paper
on the future of the civil service. It is to remove 'unnecessary layers of
management' from central government departments and to define more closely
than previously the functions of senior officials. It says baldly: 'The
government believes it will be in the national interest to have over a
period a somewhat smaller but better-paid senior civil service.'
According to those engaged in departmental reviews the result could be the
shedding of about one third of the 3,000 mandarins at grade 5 and above -
Whitehall's cream - with a significant impact on jobs at lower levels.
Although the most significant department to cut so far, the Treasury is not
the first to announce big job reductions at the top. In May the Department
of Transport unveiled a two-year 'streamlining' which will lead to the loss
of about a fifth of the department's 15,000 staff. Large-scale job cuts have
also been mooted at the environment and health departments, and almost every
part of Whitehall is at some stage in a senior management review.
The rationale for the reviews is partly political and partly managerial. At
the political level ministers are acutely conscious of the contrast between
Tory rhetoric about 'small government' and the reality that the number of
non-industrial civil servants has fallen by barely 10 per cent since
Baroness Thatcher took office in 1979. Industrial civil servants have borne
the brunt of cuts - the early 1990s even saw an increase in the number of
non-industrial staff.
The managerial imperative flows from the industry-wide drive to devolve
responsibility for service delivery to line managers, and to relate 'head
office' functions more closely to core responsibilities.
As Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury, said in a lecture
this May to Durham University Business School: 'We have seen a shift away
from the 'command and control' style of management towards much greater
emphasis on decentralisation.' He said this resulted in 'a more contractual
approach of setting objectives against which management units might be
judged'.
A further pressure on ministers and departments is the freeze in civil
service running costs announced in last November's Budget. As resources fall
in real terms over the next four years staff will nonetheless be expected to
achieve constant improvements in the quality of service, in line with the
Citizen's Charter. To help them, government departments will be given
greater freedom over budgets, including the right to decide the salaries and
grading of staff, whose pay makes up more than half of civil service running
costs.
As part of the same process, permanent secretaries are being encouraged to
'de-layer' - reorganise their management structures with fewer grades - and
to impose personal contracts that emphasise the responsibilities of
officials to manage.
This means that Whitehall will be taking the same bitter medicine it has
imposed on the rest of the public service.
Yet pressure for reform does not stop there. A report of the Cabinet Office
Efficiency Unit last November wanted more top Whitehall jobs to be
advertised openly to ensure that non-Whitehall candidates were considered.
As the steamroller advances, the Whitehall 'career for life' will be
endangered - and some fear that the non-political status of the civil
service may come into question.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: SIB may be given expanded
function
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has proposed devolving more of its regulatory powers under the
Financial Services Act to the Securities and Investments Board, while taking
on additional duties for itself regulating occupational pensions and
insurance.
The Treasury's proposal to devolve more of its duties to SIB is seen as a
vote of confidence in SIB's activities.
In its review document released yesterday the Treasury proposed three key
areas where it felt SIB could expand its role. The Treasury said its
director of finance regulation and industry should review whether additional
work could be passed to SIB without primary legislation.
In particular, the Treasury would pass on the day-to-day responsibility for
overseeing the listing department of the London Stock Exchange, a move which
would make SIB more like the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Such a development is unlikely to be welcomed by the exchange, which is
under pressure from SIB to alter some of its rules on the transparency of
transactions.
Moreover, the move would create additional expense for the exchange because,
unlike the Treasury, where costs are paid for out of tax revenues, SIB must
recover the costs of its activities from the regulated bodies themselves.
The Treasury said it would like to pass on the responsibility for
determining whether the rules and operation of overseas exchanges that wish
to conduct investment business in the UK are as rigorous as those of
domestic exchanges. While SIB already has a consulting role in making these
decisions, the Treasury is the final arbiter.
The Treasury has also proposed that SIB take on responsibility for
determining which territories offer equivalent investor protection to that
in the UK. Investment businesses from equivalently-regulated territories may
be allowed to operate in Britain.
Senior Treasury officials had been hinting for months that they believed
responsibility for regulation of occupational pensions and prudential
supervision of life assurance companies should be concentrated in its
department.
Yesterday's document said: 'In particular we see considerable logic and
attractions in the suggestion that the Treasury might eventually take on
more responsibility, for example, for the regulation of pensions and
insurance. Such a move would bring responsibility for regulating all the key
financial institutions and markets into one department, the Treasury.'
Sources familiar with the Treasury plans said the department expects to
provide oversight for the proposed new occupational pensions regulator to be
created through legislation in this parliamentary session. Responsibility
for occupational pensions currently rests with the Department of Social
Services, while the Department of Trade and Industry is responsible for the
prudential supervision of life insurance companies.
The DSS said yesterday: 'This is a Treasury internal document. The proposal
in question would be for discussion and concerns a possible change for the
future. The organisation of government is not for a single department to
decide.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: Officials put a brave face on
redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stiff upper lips were in evidence at the Treasury yesterday as officials
reacted philosophically to news of swingeing job cuts.
An official whose job is in the firing line said: 'One has got to be
intellectually honest about this. There are one or two details about the
proposals which I disagree with, but the overall goal of cutting down on
management layers in the civil service is something hard to argue against.'
Such stoicism was the order of the day throughout the department, with
officials mindful that the medicine they were being forced to swallow was
precisely the stuff they had dosed out to other government departments for a
decade in the cause of greater public sector efficiency.
Another high-ranking civil servant said: 'A lot of people can see the logic
behind the moves, even if the costs in human terms are uncomfortable.'
There was some concern, however, that the proposals might jeopardise the
tradition at the Treasury that promising young officials can expect a series
of promotions to the higher echelons of the department over an unbroken
civil service career.
A long-standing Treasury official said: 'Anyone in the bottom layers and who
saw themselves as having a job for life is bound to be disappointed. But I
suppose this is exactly what's happened to tens of thousands of others
outside the department.'
Another concern is officials in their forties and fifties, just below the
top layer in the Treasury and so not well enough connected to land senior
jobs in private industry, yet too old to take on jobs for youthful
high-fliers that might be on offer in the City.
But as officials digested the implications of the proposals there was even
time for some grudging admiration for Mr Jeremy Heywood, the young Treasury
official who masterminded the review. 'He's razor sharp, an absolutely
brilliant individual who could get a job virtually anywhere,' said one
Treasury man whose own future at the department is in doubt.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: Shaping up for a radical
reorientation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The radical report on the Treasury's 'fundamental expenditure review of
running costs', published yesterday with a broad endorsement by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, recommends that a quarter of the department's top
jobs should go by next April.
Sir Terry Burns, the Treasury's permanent secretary, is frank. 'We shall
have a difficult and stressful period ahead,' he wrote to staff yesterday.
One senior official likened the impact of the report to the visit of the
International Monetary Fund in 1976, the crisis year of the last Labour
government.
The review proposes that the number of senior management posts in the
Treasury be cut from 99 to 72 by next April. The knock-on effect will be
significant in the lower grades which account for most of the Treasury's
1,400 staff.
Behind the cuts lies a radical reorientation of the Treasury's activities.
The number of directorates will be reduced from nine to seven, with a lesser
emphasis on economic forecasting - which Mr Clarke insists should be
market-tested in two years' time - and a big reduction in the effort the
Treasury makes to shadow the spending departments. The review also proposes
a mission statement for the first time.
Even Conservatives close to the Treasury are divided about the plans. Mr
Andrew Tyrie, an adviser to both Lord Lawson and Mr John Major in their
periods as chancellor, said: 'Unlike much of the civil service the Treasury
ain't broken, so there must be doubts about the wisdom of such a fundamental
cull.'
By contrast, Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum and a
Tory MEP, said the proposals represented a 'historic opportunity' to reshape
Whitehall and strip out unnecessary administrative tiers. He likened the
review to the revolutionary Treasury-driven reform process in New Zealand,
which has led to senior officials serving on individual contracts tied to
performance targets.
For most observers the key issue is whether the reforms will limit the
Treasury's capacity to control the spending departments. The review insists
that the Treasury must 'continue to exercise the firmest possible control
over public expenditure' but can do so without the 'current panoply of
detailed controls over departmental gifts, ex gratia payments, projects and
so on.'
Some Treasury insiders are doubtful. 'It's a shame Terry Burns was not
around when the IMF came in 1976 - then he would know why the controls are
necessary,' said one.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Mark Thatcher role not to be investigated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of parliament's most powerful select committees yesterday decided not to
investigate allegations that Mr Mark Thatcher, the son of the former prime
minister, received Pounds 12m in commission from an arms deal negotiated by
the British government in the 1980s.
As Labour MPs continued to put pressure on ministers to reveal more about
the Al-Yamamah deal forged by the UK and Saudi Arabia in 1984, the all-party
public accounts committee agreed that an investigation of Mr Thatcher's
involvement would be outside its remit.
Mr Robert Sheldon, PAC chairman, is understood to have told MPs at a meeting
yesterday that the committee could only examine issues affecting taxpayers'
money. He said newspaper allegations concerning Mr Thatcher had shown no
impropriety as far as public money was concerned.
Mr Sheldon told MPs that there would be no change in his decision to
withhold publication of a report by the National Audit Office into the
UK-Saudi arms deal. He assured MPs that the NAO report contained no
reference to Mr Thatcher.
As Labour MPs continued to raise questions about the Al-Yamamah deal Mr John
Major insisted yesterday that there was no substance to allegations in a
confidential document that Mr Thatcher had profited from the contract.
The document, which was sent to the prime minister by Mr Jeff Rooker, a
Labour MP, claims that sizeable payments were paid to the Conservative party
and that Mr Thatcher and Mr Wafic Said, a Saudi businessman, acted as
intermediaries.
The document, dated May 2 1989, was sent anonymously to Mr Rooker, who at
the time had been pursuing civil servants and ministers with questions about
arms deals involving the Middle East.
Mr Rooker agreed to keep the contents confidential but sent a copy of the
memorandum to Baroness Thatcher, then prime minister. She replied that it
had been 'passed to the appropriate authorities'.
A UK defence industry source with close involvement with the Middle East
confirmed last night that Munir Attalah, one of the individuals mentioned in
the memorandum had played a key role as a middle-man in arms deals between
the UK and Jordan in the 1980s, some of which involved Iraq.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Ashdown calls for ethics in public office bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday called for an
ethics in public office bill, saying this was the only way to address the
growth of 'sleaze' in government.
Amid continuing allegations of corruption against senior Tories Mr Ashdown
said that comprehensive legislation was needed if the reputation of
parliament was to be saved.
The bill, which would be modelled on legislation passed in the Irish
Republic, would set out rules on commercial and non-parliamentary business
for MPs and government officials.
It would also set up structures whereby MPs could be censured if they were
found guilty of any wrongdoing. The Irish government has recently introduced
a measure which provides for fines of up to Pounds 20,000 and three years'
imprisonment for offenders.
He said: 'Public faith in Mr Major's administration and trust in parliament
and its process is not going to be restored by denials and promises to root
out future wrongdoings.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Thomas Arnold, Tory MP for Hazel Grove and a former vice-chairman of the
Conservative party, was yesterday elected chairman of the influential
Treasury and civil service committee of MPs.
The move was seen as a boost for the body's independence from government. Mr
Nigel Forman, the MP for Carshalton and Wallington, is understood to have
been the preferred candidate of government business managers.
The vacancy arose because of the appointment of Mr John Watts, the previous
incumbent, as transport minister.
Sir Thomas said that he would regard his first duty as upholding the
independence and integrity of the committee.
He said he would wish to consult members regularly. It was 'very important
that the chairman makes a conscious effort to talk to members individually
to address any concerns and to seek their advice.'
Sir Thomas faces a delicate task balancing the views of members ranging from
Labour's Ms Diane Abbott on the left to the Tories' Mr Barry Legg on the
right.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Whitehall checks pensions reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry has no immediate plans to introduce
personal pensions for civil servants, a spokesman said yesterday after a
leaked letter had sparked fears of a reform.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, wrote to Mr Jonathan
Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, saying that the DTI would 'look at
the issue of personal/portable personal pension schemes, given the changes
in civil service careers, post the white paper.'
The letter, dated September 9, was leaked by the First Division Association
which represents senior civil servants, including those at the DTI.
But it is understood that the review of pensions stems from a white paper
which considered whether employment terms created barriers for movement
between the public and private sectors. 'The question was whether we should
be doing anything to remove the barriers,' a DTI spokesman said.
An internal review concluded that the form of pension provision was rarely a
bar to civil servants who wish to leave for a job in the private sector, nor
has it greatly deterred private sector employees from joining the civil
service.
The ability to calculate transfer values and changes to rules covering
so-called deferred pensions have made the transferability of pension
benefits less of a problem than had been thought.
But it is understood that, more broadly, Mr Heseltine has concerns about the
expense of civil service pensions which are administered by the Treasury via
the Public Civil Service Pension Scheme.
The scheme allows retirement for members of both sexes at age 60, early
retirement in many instances with no actuarial reduction in benefits. It is
also fully index-linked to the retail price index and is non-contributory.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Ulster cable TV franchise advertised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Independent Television Commission is to advertise the biggest cable
franchise in the UK - covering all of Northern Ireland.
The announcement was made by Sir George Russell, the commission chairman, in
a speech at Queen's University, Belfast last night.
The cable franchise, which will almost certainly offer telecommunications
services as well as extra channels of television, will cover about 530,000
homes. Until now the West Midlands franchise covering 490,000 homes was the
biggest.
Bidders for the Northern Ireland 'local delivery licence' will not be
required to cable the entire province. But they will have to say what parts
of the area they intend to serve, by what means and by what timetable. It is
possible that the cities and larger towns of Northern Ireland could be
cabled, but that the rural areas could be served by microwave broadcasts.

A parliamentary inquiry into allegations that Tory MPs received cash for
tabling parliamentary questions was in chaos last night after seven Labour
MPs withdrew in fury that it would not be open to the public.
As the government faced mounting pressure over accusations of 'sleaze' the
MPs - who make up the Labour contingent on the powerful committee on
privileges - protested that justice had to be seen to be done.
The all-party committee, which examines cases of parliamentary misconduct,
is due to interview two Tory MPs over reports that they were prepared to
accept Pounds 1,000 in return for tabling parliamentary questions. The two
MPs, Mr Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick, have denied the allegations.
Clashes erupted between members of the committee on Tuesday night after Tory
MPs narrowly secured a vote to hold the hearings in private.
The Labour committee members - including Mr Doug Hoyle, chairman of the
parliamentary Labour party, and Mr Tony Benn, former cabinet minister - said
yesterday that the public deserved to witness the evidence on television.
Mr Hoyle said: 'The public are extremely concerned about MPs generally and
it has got to be seen that we are quite prepared to look at all these cases
in public, so the public can see what we are doing about it.'
He and his Labour colleagues said that they would not attend hearings 'until
further discussions have taken place' between Conservative and Labour whips.
Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, yesterday defended the decision
not to hold public hearings. He cited a 'long-standing procedure of hearing
evidence in the first part of its inquiry . . . in private'.
Yesterday Labour MPs pressed for the publication of details of an official
investigation into claims that Lord Archer, former deputy chairman of the
Conservative party, had been involved in insider dealing. Sixty-one Labour
MPs signed an emergency Commons motion 'regretting' that the case had not
been taken before the courts and demanding the publication of an inspectors'
report which cleared him of wrongdoing.
The prime minister rejected calls for publication of the report earlier this
week.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Blair 'war footing' pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tony Blair yesterday sought to put Labour on a 'war footing' against the
'ruthless and unprincipled' Conservatives in his first speech to MPs since
becoming party leader.
In a morale boosting address to a crowded meeting at Westminster Mr Blair
promised 'inclusive' leadership in return for strong support and strict
parliamentary discipline.
In a clear appeal for party unity, Mr Blair told MPs: 'The only divisions
are between those who want to win and those who don't want to win. And we
must all be on the winning side.'
Acknowledging fears among leftwing traditionalists about the growing
domination of the party by the modernisers, he called for an end to conflict
between 'cliques and cabals, left and right, modernisers and
traditionalists'.
Mr Blair also urged Labour MPs to spend more time communicating the party's
message to voters, especially those who might not have voted for the party
before.
He said the party should make more use of regional television programmes,
and 'worry less about getting a few paragraphs in The Guardian, and try to
get more positive coverage in the Daily Mirror, The Sun and the Daily Mail'.
Labour had to develop a strong message, a clear identity and high-quality
organisation, he said. People must know what they were voting for in the
polling booth, and must trust it.
He told MPs that the approach to the general election had started, and
warned them to avoid complacent acceptance of the party's lead in the
opinion polls.
In a clear indication of his confidence in the party's ability to take the
fight to the Tories he said there were 'no no-go' areas, even on issues not
traditionally regarded as strong Labour territory. 'We are up against a
ruthless and unprincipled party. We need to be principled, but as determined
as they are,' he said.

The Home Office last night confirmed that it is being sued for about Pounds
500,000 in compensation by two software houses which bid unsuccessfully for
a Pounds 14m project to transfer 3m records of custodial convictions to the
police national computer.
According to Computing newspaper, Saztec Europe claims it was not told the
duration of the project had been extended. Phoenix Interface Technology says
its bid was not considered properly and fairly.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Improved ferry safety urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Institution of Naval Architects yesterday called for urgent action
to improve safety standards on roll-on-roll-off passenger ferries.
The sinking of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic last month with the loss of
more than 900 lives gave added weight to the call for tighter standards, it
said. The institution first made a plea for improvements in 1988.

Domestic consumers should see gas prices fall by between 8 per cent and 12
per cent once the market is fully deregulated, independent gas companies
told MPs yesterday.
At a hearing of the trade and industry committee managers of companies which
hope to enter the gas market once British Gas' monopoly is ended said the
average price cut across the country would be 10 per cent.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Police quell riot outside Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police guarding the House of Commons were bombarded with bottles, sticks and
fire crackers last night as they quelled a riot by opponents of the criminal
justice and public order bill, Ivor Owen writes.
The rioters tried to storm the main gates used by ministers and MPs and
police were forced to use batons to disperse them.
All the entrances to the Commons and the Lords were closed. MPs and
officials were prevented from leaving for more than an hour.
Before the riot reached its full intensity the government bowed to the view
of the Lords and strengthened the safeguards for defendants who exercise the
modified right to silence - one of the most significant changes introduced
by the bill.
It was one of the few amendments made to the bill by peers which the
government agreed to accept.
Under pressure from law lords and other peers Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary, accepted the need for a revised caution emphasising that juries
would be entitled to draw inferences from a defendant's refusal to respond
to police questioning.
The proposed version reads: 'You do not have to say anything. But if you do
not mention now something which you later use in your defence, the court may
decide that your failure to mention it now strengthens the case against you.
A record will be made of anything you say and it may be given in evidence if
you are brought to court.'

FT  20 OCT 94 / Modest recovery forecast for house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices are poised to stage a modest recovery, increasing by 6 per cent
by the end of next year and rising by almost 50 per cent by the end of the
decade, according to a forecast published yesterday by UBS, the broking
group.
It said the increases would still 'represent the weakest housing recovery
since the second world war'.
Even so, UBS expects prices to outpace income growth, forecasting an average
rise of 8 per cent a year in house prices to the end of the decade, when the
average price of a home would be Pounds 92,000.
This would appear to point to a bigger rise in general inflation than that
expected by many building societies and banks. UBS is forecasting relatively
high rates of growth and inflation in the next few years compared with other
financial institutions.
Mr Rob Thomas, who has replaced Mr John Wriglesworth as UBS housing analyst,
said talk of a structural change in the housing market had been exaggerated.
Mr Thomas said: 'Nothing in our recent experience suggests that the
traditional relationship between the economic cycle and the housing market
has fundamentally altered.'
He added that rising incomes and job growth would underpin the price rise,
which would continue until the end of the decade.
UBS said house prices in relation to earnings remained the cheapest they had
been for many years while lenders were likely to ease restrictions on
borrowing as the general economic recovery gathered pace.
Purchasers who had held back from buying during the recession would
eventually be encouraged to buy, with sales in England and Wales likely to
increase to 1.4m next year from an expected 1.2m this year.
Property transactions were forecast to rise 40 per cent in the next three
years, peaking at an annual rate of 1.8m in 1997 and 1998. Negative equity
and the high mortgage in-debtedness of existing borrowings would, however,
continue to act as a drag on the market and prevent a faster rate of
recovery, UBS said.
It said a rise in household formation would be offset by a reduction in the
number of young people in the first time home-buying age group.
Numbers in this age group were expected to decline between now and the end
of the century, due to demographic factors.
Price movements this year have been sluggish with Halifax, Britain's biggest
mortgage lender, reporting a 0.7 per cent fall in average prices in the 12
months to the end of September.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Government wins justice bill vote
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government secured a majority of 26 in the Commons last night to
overturn the first of a series of amendments made by the House of Lords to
the controversial criminal justice and public order bill.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, warned that changes made by the Lords
would undermine the secure training centres planned for persistent juvenile
offenders.
But he failed to convince Mr Peter Bottomley, Conservative MP for Eltham,
who joined with opposition MPs in voting against the government.
Their bid to retain a Lords amendment which would have permitted the courts
to choose between sending persistent juvenile offenders to the proposed
secure training centres and secure accommodation controlled by local
authorities was defeated by 298 votes to 272.

FT  20 OCT 94 / Sponsors boost 'passport to a job'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government believes its new 'vocational A-levels' will be recognised as
a passport to employment, following yesterday's announcement that 15
companies will sponsor the qualifications.
Advanced General National Vocational Qualifications - known either as
Vocational A-levels or GNVQs - are central to the government's attempts to
ensure that more students stay in education after the age of 16. They
completed their pilot earlier this year, and are intended to be taken as
vocational courses in the sixth form.
In theory they provide a middle path between academic A-levels and narrower,
more trade-related national vocational qualifications (NVQs), which are
designed to be taken in the workplace. Thus they should be good both for
university entrance and for moving straight into employment.
Academics such as Professor Alan Smithers of the University of Manchester
have questioned whether it is possible for one qualification to achieve both
aims. Careers teachers seem to have similar doubts.
A report by government inspectors of schools and further education colleges
earlier this week suggested that students were still being steered towards
A-levels by careers counsellors, even if they had little chance of passing
them. These are the people for whom the GNVQ has been designed.
The government doubted that students would take up the qualifications
without evidence that employers took them seriously.
Each company is offering assistance towards qualifications in a particular
subject. For example, students taking a GNVQ in leisure and tourism will be
allowed to take up the American Express sponsorship, which offers work
experience with local businesses.
Amex will make extra awards to the top performing students in each of 13
regions. Travel bursaries are on offer for the top performers.
Laing, the construction company, is offering similar support for the
construction and built environment GNVQ, with guarantees of work and project
experience for all students taking the course across the UK and awards for
the top performers in each region.

FT  20 OCT 94 / BR to shed maintenance jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 1,800 railway maintenance jobs will be lost as a result of
privatisation and a reduction in the work available, British Rail said
yesterday.
British Rail Infrastructure Services plans to make 1,400 of its track and
signal maintenance staff redundant as part of its preparations for
privatisation while British Rail Maintenance, which looks after rolling
stock, will shed 350 jobs because of lower workloads.
Unions said that the cuts could lead to a further reduction in maintenance
work being done on the railway. Work levels have already fallen back since
Railtrack took over responsibility for BR track and signalling in April,
they added.
The redundancies amount to a reduction of 15 per cent in the white-collar
workforce of infrastructure services. The unions expect that to be followed
by cuts in the number of blue-collar jobs. Managers and administrative staff
account for nearly 9,000 of the total infrastructure workforce of 30,000.
The reduction, which BR hopes to achieve by voluntary redundancies, will be
spread across the country at infrastructure offices in Derby, Birmingham,
Bristol, Newcastle upon Tyne, Doncaster, Peterborough and London.
As part of privatisation BR is splitting its maintenance, track renewal and
design activities into 20 separate companies. Last month it invited
potential bidders to register their interest with the aim of completing a
sale by the end of next year.
The Transport Salaried Staffs Association said its members were resigned to
the cuts and that morale was bad. 'The message we get is that there has been
a falling off in the work that is being done,' it said. It denied that there
was any threat to safety.
Railtrack said during the recent signal workers' strike that it was carrying
out only essential work to save money but some train operating companies
complained about declining maintenance standards before the strike started.
Railtrack has already started seeking competitive tenders for maintenance
work. This has meant in some cases that work has gone to a company in
another part of the country and not, as was previously the case, to its
local region.
Mr Robert Horton, Railtrack chairman, has promised a squeeze on the
railway's annual Pounds 1.8bn maintenance bill.
Infrastructure service companies have a combined turnover of more than
Pounds 1bn - including seven maintenance companies with turnover of Pounds
850m and six track renewal companies which carry out heavier work and have
sales of Pounds 200m. There are also seven design offices.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour transport spokesman, condemned the job losses as a
consequence of the fragmentation of the railway.
