FT  17 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: How loan pricing is set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PAUL J L REX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I could not disagree more strongly with Dominique de la Barre
d'Erquelinnes' letter (October 5) which propounds one of the central errors
committed by many lending banks. Even a cursory reading of the comments on
the syndicated loans market in Monday's FT gives a clear picture of how loan
pricing is actually being set at present.
The banking industry has been characterised by extreme overcapacity for much
of the past two decades. As in any other industry, this inevitably pushes
down prices, and many decisions to lend at low rates have been rationalised
by an over-optimistic view of the general provisioning costs which must be
covered by the loan margin. Since actual loan losses are highly sensitive to
the economic cycle, inadequate pricing is often masked in the early years of
development of loan portfolios until heavier, specific provisions are
required. Once the pricing inadequacy is exposed, many banks exit one
lending sector and enter a new one, only to repeat the same mistake in a
different setting - creating a 'cascade' of problem loans.
A more rational decision would have been, as Ms de la Barre suggests, to
refuse to lend, but this would have involved many lending officers and their
line managers putting themselves out of work.
Annual provisioning charges linked to the riskiness of the underlying
transactions will not solve the problem of overcapacity. However, they will
force bank managements to confront the explicit cost of pursuing a given
lending strategy and make it clear that much lending business is loss-making
over the course of the economic cycle.

FT  17 OCT 94 / The final chapter: Electronic media are challenging the book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After several years of successful expansion, the UK publishing industry is
experiencing a rare twitch of self-doubt.
It has been shaken, a little, by the prospective demise of the net book
agreement, which allows publishers to set the retail price of books to
prevent discounting. The agreement is due to be reviewed by the restrictive
practices court, but seems to be unravelling already as publishers and
retailers divide over its continued usefulness.
However, it is the growth in electronic media and new channels of
information that has really got the industry stirred. The prominence of
software stands at this month's Frankfurt Book Fair was a portent that
publishers are finding hard to ignore: could developments such as these be
the death-knell for the book-as-we-know-it?
The snapshot of a family at leisure in the 21st century, previously
constructed by the fertile imaginations of science-fiction writers, is now a
more tangible vision: one parent snaps a credit card-sized disc of a novel
into a compact computer with CD-Rom drive, sets the automatic scroll at the
appropriate reading speed and relaxes for the evening; another prepares
dinner from a recipe delivered in multimedia format on the kitchen screen;
meanwhile, the children use interactive programmes to research their
homework. That already assumes that all of them are not, en famille,
watching television or a movie, or listening to music.
The idea that the family home's bookshelves will be creaking with volumes of
the Encyclopaedia Britannica, special interest reference books and a
lifetime of novels seems sadly anachronistic.
Of course, publishers have been studying these developments for years; what
has prompted the latest dip in confidence has been the recent check in the
publishing resurgence of the past decade. From 1981 to 1993, the number of
new titles (including new editions) published in the UK nearly doubled from
46,215 a year to 83,780. Even the expensive sector of scientific, academic
and professional books recorded a near doubling of new titles.
This year, so far, has been a different story. Mr Clive Bradley, chief
executive of the Publishers Association, describes the summer-to-Easter
period as 'disappointing'. Despite a pick-up over the last couple of months,
sceptics, who have all along insisted that the industry's expansion was
unsustainable, are making their voices heard. They have long awaited a
'turning-point' and, given the speed of developments in information
technology, it is only natural that the very future of the book has become a
focus for concern.
The two developments that threaten the book format are digitisation and the
multimedia revolution. Digitisation, which allows text and graphics to be
stored electronically, provides easy access to very large amounts of
information. Multimedia packages present that information through text,
graphics and sound which the user can manipulate.
Vital markets such as education and business are expected increasingly to
turn to such formats. Yet Mr Bradley points out that the print medium is
still holding its own: 'Even in reference material, it is still a common
reaction for people to find CD-Roms and screens relatively cumbersome, it is
often much quicker to pick up a book.
'Multimedia, though it sounds fine in principle, needs to be well done to
keep the attention for longer than a few minutes, almost like a movie. That
costs a lot of money.'
He also points out that the information revolution has not been matched by a
revolution of the human mind: 'We are all still waiting for someone who can
awaken the mind in a new way, an Einstein for the era, but it has not
happened yet. Many of the new packages around do not offer a great deal more
than modern text books.'
When it comes to fiction, Mr Bradley finds it even more difficult to
conceive of electronic publishing having a significant impact on book-buying
habits. The most advanced development in this area is in interactive
packages, allowing the reader to choose between several different endings,
according to his or her mood.
Once the novelty value has worn off, it is hard to see these packages
competing against the attractions of a slim, cheap paperback that manages to
make up its own mind, Mr Bradley believes.
'Interactive media are fine for developing curiosity and search skills, but
less satisfactory for books to be read sequentially,' he said.
A measure of publishers' confidence in the book is their commitment to the
most threatened sector of the market: the reference book. It might be
thought that publishers would be bringing out new reference material only in
CD-Rom form, phasing out the book in much the same way as record companies
phased out vinyl records in favour of compact discs.
But that does not appear to be the case. Chambers, which specialises in
reference books, has just brought out a new encyclopaedic English
dictionary, aimed primarily at secondary school children. Although it will
come out in electronic form next year, Mr John Clement, chairman of Chambers
Harrap, says he expects the book to out-sell the electronic version by about
10 to one.
'We are not expecting such books to die out in the near future,' he said.
'The book still has the huge advantage of sheer facility, primarily because
of its portability and the pleasure which can be had from browsing it.'
Mr Bradley echoes this sentiment: 'The technology of producing a book is
cheap, the culture of reading a book is very well-established. That will
take it a long way.'
But once the costs of the new electronic media begin to spiral downwards,
will the physical frisson of leafing through a new volume be enough to
ensure its survival? And will the new, computer-smart generations experience
it at all?
The view that curling up with a good book is one of the timeless pleasures
of civilised life is about to face its most radical challenge yet.

Sir, Market definitions present notorious difficulties as is demonstrated by
the Pentos claim that Dillons at its low in June had a market share of 31.5
per cent ('Pentos Pounds 36m in the red after exceptional costs', October
12).
The annual value of the UK book market is some Pounds 2.5bn and Dillons'
sales cannot be more than Pounds 200m, which is 8 per cent. Even if the
market is defined more narrowly as consumer books, Pounds 200m equates to
about 12 per cent. What market definition produces a figure of more than
twice that level?

FT  17 OCT 94 / Arts: Royal Opera and the twisted Ring / A look at why the
new cartoon-style version of Das Rheingold led to booing at Covent Garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was tempestuous booing after the Royal Opera's new, cartoon-style Das
Rheingold last Thursday. It sounded genuinely angry and disappointed, not
orchestrated in advance, and it was quite specific. Once the soloists and
the conductor, Bernard Haitink, had been warmly applauded, one after
another, the producer and designer were greeted with howls of fury on a
truly Wagnerian scale, unprecedented - within recent memory, anyhow - at
Covent Garden.
You might think: Wagnerians are a conservative lot, they want all the hoary
old paraphernalia intact, and the story enacted with uncritical piety. The
Wagnerites, here including many Wagner-lovers who were seeing their first
Ring in the flesh, would retort: this Rheingold production is unforgivably
silly, facetious, inconsequent, diminishing. Yet it is worth remarking that
on the next night, Die Walkure - staged in just the same spirit - earned as
much delighted applause as booing: less newsworthy, but an interesting fact.
The seeds of the trouble (honestly fated, as I think) lay in Wagner's own
notion of the Gesamtkunstwerk, the complete art-work - which could only be
opera - in which everything heard and seen should be dictated by an
overriding idea. In Wagner's case that was easy; his own taste was for
picturesque naturalism, and at Bayreuth he used to supervise every detail of
the sets, the costumes, the wigs, the action. Long after he died, the family
establishment that Bayreuth became was still dedicated to preserving all
those details.
Before then, producers and designers were barely nodded to. Their tasks were
respectively to organise the chorus and help the singers avoid bumping into
each other, and to illustrate the librettist's notional locales
attractively, and when appropriate impressively. Earlier composers -
Monteverdi, Mozart - were often closely involved with the staging, but in
the later 19th century the burgeoning of operatic apparatus made that
unfeasible for anyone less despotically privileged than Wagner. When Wagner
died, however, the concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk lived on; and who, in the
absence of the original genius, was to realise it?
Part of the problem, as Wagnerians outside Bayreuth discovered, was that
literal adherence to Wagner's detailed stage prescriptions soon looks naff,
fusty, lifeless. Our tastes in stage manners change. The Royal Opera's
clever producer and designer, Richard Jones and Nigel Lowery, must have
decided early on that there was no mileage to be got out of staging
Alberich's transformations into dragon and toad for real, nor the entry of
the gods into Valhalla across the rainbow bridge, nor the wild ride of the
Valkyries.
Part of the answer came from two visionary designers, Edward Craig and the
Swiss Adolphe Appia, and it was driven home by Wagner's grandson Wieland.
Simplify everything, even the visible action; take fussy visual details as
read, and eliminate them; use modern lighting to set the stage suggestively
and strip it down to an arena for the singing actors. Above all, honour the
concept of the work - which may have to be winkled out from its
old-fashioned format.
Never mind that some great operas seem not to be based on any 'guiding
concept' at all; for Wagner's, at least, we have the composer's own
testimony that his were. Now, Der Ring des Nibelungen is a heady brew of
despairing idealism and political prophecy, Jungian mythology before its
time and importunate Affekt, fake-primeval epic and ripe 19th-century
melodrama. If there really was some overriding Wagnerian conception of the
whole, to grasp it we should need to reformulate it in our own modern terms
 -which are inexorably different.
Ring producers in the 1970s and 1980s liked to fix it to some one modern
concept: of political power, or class resentment, or familial tragedy. The
peculiarity of the Jones/Lowery staging is simply that it is a pure
post-modernist affair, where the designer's fancies have equal weight with
anything else. It offers no all-in reading of the operas, but plays
catch-as-catch-can with any ideas that they happen to trigger off, with
visual cues taken from Picasso, Ernst, Klee and others too numerous to
mention. Making the giants Fasolt and Fafner into Siamese twins who share a
suit is one such. Others include garbing the Rhinemaidens as gross
rubberised nudes, having Fricka as well as Froh and Donner grow a long beard
when deprived of the golden youth-apples, and putting Brunnhilde into a
tracksuit with a Hallowe'en top and a dinky cheerleader's skirt. During the
innocent-age-of-the-world prologue, the Rhinemaidens had to weed their way
among a horde of strange, blue-uniformed persons hustling in slow motion
toward stage left, reminiscent of Thurber's cartoon for 'The Day the Dam
Broke' but quite unexplained.
In Die Walkure, those personages became corn-dolly figures with lofty
headdresses. One of them, preternaturally tall, served as the tree from
which Siegmund must draw the magic sword, and he had plainly outlined
shoulder-pads. At the crunch point, Siegmund and Sieglinde pulled at his
scarecrow arms in opposite directions. Fricka's cart, originally 'drawn by
rams', was an armoured car: okay, but did it have to sport push-button
windows?
For the epic battle which culminates in Siegmund's death, the lights go out
at the crucial moment; and come on again, after an embarrassing pause, to
reveal the remaining four characters in an absurd low-budget-sitcom row at
the grave. The brute Hunding is not felled by Wotan's scathing gaze, but
scrambles off unharmed. Cruellest of all, when the loyal but guilty
Brunnhilde prevails upon her father to mitigate her sentence - not to be
snatched up by the first comer, but only by a great hero - and the
heart-tearing crescendo reaches its climax, instead of the intended
father-daughter clinch we have Wotan breaking suddenly away and retreating
across half the stage. One of the great cathartic moments in opera is
reduced to something shrinking and evasive.
This Rheingold founders upon inconsequence and sheer lack of purpose. At the
close of the last Royal Opera Rheingold, Gotz Friedrich had the effete gods
tripping up Georges Guetary's 'Stairway to Paradise' as decadently as could
be, but at least they thought they were going somewhere. Here they do
nothing but chase a falling star, literally and ineffectually - and utterly
at odds with Wagner's triumphalist music, though like all the rest of the
score Haitink judges it to a nicety.
Even John Tomlinson's superbly robust Wotan can make little of that, and in
the earlier stages Covent Garden's regular Alberich, Ekkehard Wlaschiha, is
hobbled by being turned into a mere figure of fun. Robin Leggate's artful
Mime awaits Siegfried for his fruition. Commendations to Paul Charles
Clarke's Froh and Peter Sidhom's Donner for services in difficult
circumstances, and to Jane Henschel, whose distinguished Fricka at last
escapes her caricatured guise in Die Walkure; and to Gwynne Howell's
unexpectedly sensitive Fasolt, Carsten Stabell's Fafner and Rita Cullis's
Freia.
Robert Tear's Loge is of course incorrigibly engaging and musical. In Die
Walkure, Ulla Gustafsson's very young, shy Sieglinde wields an affecting
timbre and brave purpose, Poul Elming's Siegmund adds a raw, vulnerable edge
to a finely developed portrayal (stopping short of the ultimate exposure),
and Matthias Holle is a Hunding of sterling menace. The great discovery is
the tall American Deborah Polaski's Brunnhilde: recklessly heroic singing,
and a rare degree of whole-hearted commitment. With some more intimately
searching tone-colour, she must soon be one of the great Wagner singers of
our day.

A major retrospective of the late 19th century French painter Odilon Redon
opens at the Van Gogh Museum on Friday. It brings together 180 works,
including some important pieces which have only recently come to light. The
aim is to explore Redon's development, sources and influence, and to
demonstrate how the dreamlike nature and Symbolist aspects of his work
provided a link between 19th century Romanticism and 20th century
Surrealism. The exhibition comes from Chicago and moves to the Royal Academy
in London in February.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Arts: Lighting up the Wigmore - Nash Ensemble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Nash Ensemble, which over the last three decades has established itself
as one of Britain's foremost chamber groups, invests so much in its
performances that each concert becomes a special occasion. So much so, that
Saturday's programme at the Wigmore Hall celebrating its 30th anniversary
needed no 'gala' trappings: it was imaginatively put together and no less
imaginatively played.
The Nash musicians are almost legendary for being great communicators: they
play with an obvious sense of enjoyment, balanced by that seriousness of
approach that makes them such polished and stimulating performers. They are
dedicated to exploring the byways of the repertory  - the group's make-up
gives it versatility - with a special commitment to new music. They are
equally noted for their interpretations of French music. Indeed, Saturday's
programme, the first in a series of six entitled A Golden Age of Parisian
Music, was the start of a long birthday celebration. Between now and March,
the Nash players will be covering the work of 13 composers from Saint-Saens
to Poulenc, and providing audiences with many a rare treat.
We heard four composers on Saturday, beginning with Albert Roussel's busy
Divertissement for piano and wind quintet. It made a piquant curtain-raiser,
a complete contrast to the Ravel Trois Poemes de Stephane Mallarme that
followed, with Sarah Walker the consummate soloist. She projected the poet's
lines with intensity against the shimmering accompaniment of the two flutes,
two clarinets, string quartet and piano. Saint-Saens's Septet drew the
audience back a musical generation to a more robust idiom and very different
sonorities. It is not top-drawer Saint-Saens - the melodies are
unadventurous, often unmemorable - but the Nash's smiling, spirited
performance made good its shortcomings.
The second half of the evening was devoted to two works by Ernest Chausson:
the Chanson perpetuelle, one of his last works, also exists in the version
with piano quintet accompaniment performed here. Once again, Sarah Walker
floated her mezzo with a perfect balance of ardour and lyricism. A ravishing
performance of Chausson's Concerto for violin, piano and string quartet
rounded off the evening, with Ian Brown the virtuosic piano soloist, and the
violinist Marcia Crayford alert to the work's deeply-felt emotion. This was
music-making that brought a reminder of how the Nash Ensemble has enhanced
the London music scene, and it whetted the appetite for more.

FT  17 OCT 94 / People: The commuter who will regulate the railway -
Competition lawyer John Swift tells Charles Batchelor that he is intrigued

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
John Swift's daily train ride from Didcot Parkway, Oxfordshire, to
Paddington, London, takes just over 40 minutes, a journey time that has
stayed the same for 10 years, despite the investment that has gone into
Britain's railway.
Swift's journey to work may not have changed, but almost all other aspects
of the system are in flux. As the recently-appointed regulator of an
industry which is being made ready for privatisation, this QC and
competition lawyer will play a starring role in shaping the railway of the
future.
Swift, who has an engagingly dry sense of humour, is not the only new player
in the rail game. Robert Horton, combative head of Railtrack, which owns the
rail infrastructure, and Roger Salmon, the more reflective merchant banker-
turned-franchising-director, will also help forge the new network. But they
and others will require Swift's approval for any deals they put together.
At present, Swift and his team are attempting to impose order on the mass of
agreements which are being drawn up between the 50 or so organisations that
have replaced the monolith that was British Rail.
It is Swift's job to act as arbiter between the parties - to ensure fair
play, for example, between Railtrack, say, with its monopoly of the
10,000-mile network, and a company such as Gatwick Express, which is hoping
to win a franchise over a mere 27 miles of track.
Swift has already given notice of his intention to intervene vigorously. The
consultation process he initiated last July suggested that Railtrack would
have its work cut out justifying the returns the Treasury expects it to make
on its assets.
Swift chooses words carefully, but his intentions are clear. He says: 'If I
were to form the view that Railtrack's charges were such as to give it a
disproportionate return against the risks it is running, or its costs, then
you come close to an abuse of a dominant position in European law.'
Although Railtrack will have a dominant position by virtue of its size and
sole ownership of the track, Swift says he is not there to pillory a
particular company but to strike a balance.
'The train operators must be treated fairly if the consumer is to get a fair
deal, but I am not here just to defend the little guy. Railtrack must have
confidence that it can come to us and justify a charge without feeling that
we are in one camp.'
He wants to be a positive force in the industry rather than a threat to its
stability. 'Very formidable powers have been conferred on me by parliament,
but I do not want to create regulatory uncertainty,' - thereby creating
additional risk for investors.
Nor can he take such a purist view that he imposes impossible obligations on
the franchising director. 'I cannot burden the franchising director with a
set of agreements he cannot sell in the market place.'
Swift is there not only to hold the ring between the commercial players; he
must also take into account the government's role. The wording of his
consultation document showed clearly that in some areas he was questioning
the government's calculations in preparing the railways for privatisation.
For example, he queried both the rate of return of 5.6 per cent, rising to 8
per cent over four years, which the Treasury has insisted on for Railtrack,
and also the Pounds 6.5bn valuation put on its assets.
Both might need to be much lower, he suggests.
'I have to approach this in the most fundamental manner. If it appears that
the asset value is questionable or that the rate of return requires
revision, this is an entirely appropriate matter for the regulator to
consider.
'Anything else would be to rubber-stamp the proposals of the dominant
shareholder (the government).'
Much of his time in the past few months has been spent putting together a
team - at present about 50-strong - to deal with the mass of detail involved
in establishing a new rail structure.
He is now 54, and was headhunted to lead the Office of Rail Regulator after
25 years at the Bar. He spent much of the 1980s representing large
corporations, including IBM, in UK and European investigations into
competition issues. He was also an adviser in some of the big takeover
battles of the period, including the bid by GEC and Siemens for Plessey, and
of Guinness for Distillers.
Having defended many clients against charges of anti-competitive behaviour,
Swift was intrigued by the chance to change sides and start setting the
rules. He became special adviser to the government on rail privatisation
before taking on the post of regulator last April.
There was little in Swift's background to suggest a legal career. The family
company of Thomas Swift &amp; Co was a firm of Liverpool stevedores founded in
the 1860s. Swift seemed set to continue in the family tradition, but won an
open exhibition to University College, Oxford, where he read classics and
philosophy before switching to law.
While he was away at university, the family firm was sold and Swift went on
to pursue postgraduate international studies at the Johns Hopkins University
in Bologna, Italy. After lecturing in law at his old college, he qualified
as a barrister and entered commercial practice.
Like many outsiders who have become involved in the industry, Swift is an
enthusiast for rail's potential and foresees a 'virtuous circle of better
and more frequent services' attracting more passengers. More personally, an
efficient railway allows him to live in rural Oxfordshire where he can
pursue his enthusiasm for gardening and exotic shrubs while commuting daily
to central London.
Swift is acutely aware of the challenges his group faces. 'We are going to
be an extremely high-profile organisation in contentious areas of politics
and industry.'
One of the arcane skills he learned while training to be a stevedore was how
to splice wire rope. Tying together the disparate strands of the railway
industry will be no less demanding.

FT  17 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Musical chairs at Westpac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's changes at Westpac, the Australian bank, have increased options
for succession to the managing director's chair, which will be occupied by
expatriate American Robert Joss until early 1998, writes Bruce Jacques.
Joss, who earned his reputation reorganising US bank Wells Fargo, has
reassigned the jobs of the internal contenders and brought in former
Citibank Australia chairman, Michael Cannon-Brookes.
Cannon-Brookes, currently managing director of law firm Freehill Hollingdale
and Page, has been appointed Westpac's group executive, operations. The new
position confers stewardship of the bank's burgeoning support operations and
reports directly to Joss.
But the bank's internal changes, styled by Joss as a new focus on
performance and growth following an era of internal repair, may hold more
clues to the succession.
They include moving the high profile former Treasury bureaucrat, David
Morgan, from retail banking to head a new institutional and international
banking division. Morgan's position at retail, which controls the bulk of
the bank's assets, has been taken by former institutional banking head, Owen
van der Wall.
Biggest promotion in the shuffle has gone to Barry Robertson who is
overseeing the bank's extensive problem asset sale programme as chief of
property finance and asset management. He adds the commercial banking
division to his duties.
Speculation on the changes has centred around Morgan who was touted for the
top post before Joss was appointed last year. Morgan's new assignment has
perhaps unfairly been interpreted as a classic sideways move.
But it would scarcely be out of character for Joss to play management
musical chairs at least once more.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eugene van As, the man who engineered South African paper producer Sappi's
Dollars 1.6bn takeover of US company SD Warren last week, has long had a
reputation as one of South Africa's most aggressive and audacious
businessmen, writes Mark Suzman.
An Afrikaner by birth, van As speaks fluent English and German and has been
Sappi's chief executive since 1978, becoming executive chairman in 1991.
During that period, through a number of large-scale, high-risk deals, he has
transformed Sappi from being a mid-size South African company to one of the
world's largest paper producers.
Known within the company by his initials EVA, van As is widely admired as a
tough, no-nonsense manager with a fine grasp of the details of the paper
business and an ambitious, but impressive vision of Sappi's future as a
global paper company.
Nevertheless, there is also suspicion, particularly among shareholders, that
he has a tendency to put his empire-building ambitions ahead of their
interest. Over the past decade he has consistently made new deals just when
more conservative people might be consolidating existing operations.
His first big gamble was the construction of a R1.6bn Kraft paper mill in
the eastern Transvaal in the early 1980s. Then, in 1988, Sappi picked up
Courtaulds' huge southern African pulp interests when the UK company
disinvested. In 1990, van As began Sappi's international expansion programme
with the purchase of five UK paper mills, and in 1992 bought German-based
Hannovier Papier.
Despite van As's irrepressible optimism, however, nearly all the deals, and
particularly the Hannovier takeover which seriously dented earnings over the
past two years, have proved very difficult for Sappi to digest. As a result,
the company has at various times been forced to take drastic action, such as
suspending its dividend, before returning to an even keel.
Now, just as Hannovier appears to have turned the corner, van As has taken
his biggest gamble yet, with the highly leveraged Warren deal. Once again,
he is confident he has guessed right on the cycle and paid a reasonable
price; once again shareholders are nervous of the consequences.
But as one analyst notes succinctly: 'Whatever else you may think of him,
the guy certainly has got balls.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Araskog leaves ITT succession
still open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Travis Engen may have emerged as the front-runner to take over the top job
at ITT, the giant US manufacturing, financial serivices and hotels
conglomerate, but the race is still far from over, writes Richard Waters.
The 50-year old Engen, who has been on the fast track since joining ITT as
head of one of its defence electronics businesses nine years ago, was last
week given operating responsibility for ITT's insurance and communications
businesses. On top of his previous responsibilities, this leaves him in
charge of businesses which generate Dollars 17.4bn of the group's Dollars
22.8bn in sales.
Engen takes over his new responsibities from Dale Comey, 52, himself
considered a potential successor to ITT boss Rand Araskog, until he
unexpectedly announced his retirement last month.
A lot could still happen before Araskog reaches the company's compulsory
retirement age of 65 in October 1996, though. It was notable, according to
one ITT insider, that Araskog did not take the opportunity last week to
anoint Engen clearly as his heir apparent by naming him president and chief
operating officer.
That could still leave the door to the chairman's office ajar for Robert
Bowman, 39, the chief financial officer. Though considered a long shot for
the job, Bowman has wowed Wall Street in his two years with the company and
has been talked about as a future ITT boss.
Meanwhile, there seems little chance of Araskog going before his two years
are up. 'We'll have to drag him out of here screaming as it is,' says the
insider.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Architecture: 100 years of London pride - Centenary
celebrations for the city's survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes public money is spent wisely. One hundred years ago a remarkable
project was started that has become famous as the Survey of London. Its
centenary is being marked by a display at the Museum of London in the
Barbican (until November 27), and a slim volume has been produced by the
survey's general editor, Hermione Hobhouse, as a permanent reminder of the
importance of a rare and continuing work of scholarship.
The idea of carefully recording the buildings of a whole capital city in
measured words and drawings could have been pedestrian and boring. But for
anyone interested in architecture, the existence of the survey is as
reassuring as the presence of Saint Bartholomew's Hospital is to the City of
London.
It is good to know that quiet and serious expertise is being supported from
the public purse in the interests of learning, knowledge and excellence.
However, unlike Barts' marvellous hospital and medical school, the survey is
not in danger of being targetted by official vandals.
Indeed, the survival of this small group of dedicated scholars, historians
and measurers in post-Thatcherite Britain is something of a small miracle.
The survey started as a result of pressure from a group led by the great
arts and crafts architect C R Ashbee in the 1890s, and thrived initially
with the support of the London County Council.
That support was continued by the Greater London Council until its abolition
in 1986. The GLC had nurtured a specific to look after the historic
architecture of London. Its historic buildings division was a pioneer in the
care of listed buildings, and became an exemplar to English local
authorities.
When politics intervened in the 1980s, the division was taken over by a
quango, English Heritage. Thankfully, someone somewhere was wise enough to
see that the scholarly survey belonged elsewhere, so it was given a home in
a non-departmental public body, the Royal Commission on the Historical
Monuments of England.
This was inspired, because the founders of the royal commission had an
intellectual sympathy with the founders of the London survey. There are
portraits in the exhibition at the Museum of London of Victorian and
Edwardian statesmen like Sir John Lubbock, author of the first Ancient
Monuments Act of 1892.
During much of the 19th century, government action to preserve or care for
historic buildings had been ineffectual. It took great energy and political
manoeuvring by groups and individuals to change all this. As a result, the
end of the 19th century saw the formation of the National Trust, the Society
for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (created by William Morris and his
friends), the London Society and the London Topographical Society.
We have become used to the system that evolved at that time, but it took a
series of campaigns to alert politicians to the need to preserve the past.
It was the architect C R Ashbee who had the idea of creating local watch
committees to draw attention to the historic fabric of the parishes of
London, and to spotlight areas or specific buildings under threat.
In the words of Ashbee: 'We plead that the object of the work we have before
us is to make nobler and more humanly enjoyable the life of a great city
whose existing record we seek to mark down; to preserve of it for her
children and those yet to come whatever is best in her past or fairest in
her present ..and to stimulate among her citizens that historic and social
conscience which to all great communities is their most sacred possession.'
The work of the London survey represents in elegant and disciplined form an
expression of those ideas. The display at the Museum of London shows many of
the glories of London, which are also manifest in the great volumes that
have appeared during the last 100 years and which continue to be produced by
a dedicated team.
There is a chance to hear much more about the work of the London survey in a
series of lectures on Mondays (until November 17) at the Linnean Society,
Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. Further information can be had from
the Survey of London, Newlands House, 37-40, Berners Street, London, W1,
071-631 5065.
London Survey'd: the work of the Survey of London, 1894-1994, is published
by The Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, at Pounds
7.95.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Whistleblowers blast the pirates - A
promising start for Software Crimeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Evan Cox, European counsel for the Business Software Alliance, declared
himself satisfied. The first two days of operation of 'Software Crimeline'
had produced more than two dozen telephone calls, and the work of sorting
the genuine from the mistaken or malicious was already in progress - all
this three weeks before the organisation starts to reward whistle-blowers in
earnest.
BSA is an aggressive industry lobby comprising the world's principal
personal computer software suppliers. Software Crimeline, announced last
week, is the latest initiative in the escalation of its war against software
pirates - companies or individuals who copy software rather than pay for the
genuine article. The alliance reckons to have brought more than 500 legal
actions against such organisations since 1989.
Piracy is thought to cost the industry more than Pounds 8.5bn a year in lost
revenues, almost half of which is incurred in Europe. The figure for the UK
is Pounds 328m. The UK Federation against Software Theft seized Pounds 25m
worth of illegal software in the first half of 1994.
Nevertheless, Britain is one of only six countries where legal software
sales exceed 50 per cent of the market. In Pakistan, Thailand and the United
Arab Emirates, for example, pirated software represents 99 per cent of the
market.
Software piracy is easily perpetrated and hard to detect. Copying software
on to blank computer discs is simple. Soaring sales figures for glossy
manuals covering the operation of popular pieces of software are one
indication of how easily it can be accomplished.
Through Software Crimeline, individuals are being encouraged to ring a
hotline number - 0800 510510 - to report the use of pirated software. The
carrot, in this case, is the promise of a reward of up to Pounds 2,500 in
the case of a successful prosecution. The scheme has already been tried
successfully elsewhere. In Australia there were 150 calls in the first week
alone. In the US, a hotline has proved successful although no reward is
offered.
What sort of motive do people have for shopping their employers or
colleagues? Cox accepts that a number of calls are malicious - made,
perhaps, by disgruntled ex-employees out to settle scores.
But most calls, he believes, come from people who feel their honesty is
being compromised by being asked to work with illegally-copied software.
This can happen when a company under-estimates its software budget and
copies existing software.
Cox leaves no doubt that the BSA is losing patience with companies where
senior executives plead ignorance of the law, and is ready to press for
harsher action. Under Britain's software protection laws, penalties include
up to two years' prison for executives of offending companies.
He says: 'We have a feeling that the process of education has been going on
long enough. We were prepared to give people the benefit of the doubt at
first, but now we are tired of the old excuses - 'We didn't know', 'We
didn't understand' - and so on'.
Cox makes the point that there have been changes in software industry
practice which make piracy increasingly indefensible. High software prices
used to be blamed, but costs have fallen, sharply in many cases. Equally,
there were complaints about restrictive licensing practices from large
companies with a requirement for many copies of a particular program
(software is often licensed rather than bought outright). Easier licensing
arrangements had been agreed, he said.
A survey of computer abuse carried out by the UK Audit Commission makes
clear the kind of trouble software piracy can cause companies. It notes that
one organisation had to pay Pounds 30,000 for new licences while another
incurred costs of Pounds 100,000 after a programmer was caught with 60 discs
filled with illegal programs.
While nobody quarrels with BSA's aims, there are some qualms about its
latest methods. Among the dangers is the possibility that a malicious or
greedy employee could install illegal software on his employer's system -
then tip off the BSA.
Typically, once the BSA believes it has enough evidence against a company,
it obtains an 'Anton Pillar' order from the courts, which enable it to
search premises and seize suspect computers and discs.
The telephone hotline is just one of the ways the organisation has for
gathering information about illegal software use. But Cox has no intention
of surrendering the element of surprise: 'There are some things,' he says,
'that I am not prepared to talk about.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Media Futures: When you wish upon a keyboard - A high-tech
film challenge to Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wired, the super-hip technology magazine, regularly carries a recruitment
advertisement from Walt Disney, the entertainment group, bearing the slogan:
'If you're good with a mouse, we've got great people, cool hardware and big
challenges in advanced computer graphics'.
It seems very likely that future issues of Wired could carry a similar
advertisement from Disney's latest competitor - the new entertainment group
being launched by Jeffrey Katzenberg, who recently resigned as head of
Disney's movie studios, Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning film director,
and David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul.
The new group, like Disney itself, will be anxious to attract the cream of
the new breed of technology buffs if it is to achieve its ambition of
becoming a force in feature films and animation.
The impact of new technology on the entertainment industry not only played a
pivotal part in persuading the three partners to set up a new studio, but
will be critical in determining its development.
Steven Spielberg has made no secret of the fact that he sees the new company
as a vehicle for his experiments with movie-making technology. The
extraordinarily realistic dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, his Dollars 356m
blockbuster, were digital creations from the computers of Industrial Light
and Magic (ILM), the special effects laboratory set up in San Francisco by
George Lucas, director of Star Wars.
Digital technology enables film-makers to shoot scenes which would otherwise
be too expensive - or logistically impossible - to film.
Jurassic Park proved how appealing such techo-trickery could be. Digital
effects also feature in some of this year's box-office hits, including
Forrest Gump, which creates the illusion of Tom Hanks participating in
famous historical events, and True Lies, the Arnold Schwarzenegger action
film whose director, James Cameron, has teamed up with IBM to create his own
Digital Domain special effects lab in Los Angeles.
Spielberg is intent on further developing the creative potential of digital
effects at the new studio. Similarly, technology is an essential element of
Jeffrey Katzenberg's plans to create a new animation company.
Animation is one of the most lucrative areas of movie-making (largely
because of the high sales potential for videos and other merchandise).
But the expense of recruiting large teams of skilled artisans has
traditionally deterred newcomers from challenging Disney's dominance of the
animation field.
The quality of animated films has been transformed by the computer-generated
techniques that Jeffrey Katzenberg encouraged his animators to use at
Disney, as illustrated by the success of The Lion King, one of the most
elaborate animated films ever, which took Dollars 267m in four months at the
US box office.
These new techniques have also reduced the need for skilled craftsmen,
thereby paving the way for the new company (as well as Warner, one of the
major studios) to move into animation.
Finally, the technological revolution in movie-making has drawn new
investors into the entertainment industry from related fields that include
electronics, information technology and telecommunications. As a result,
there should be no shortage of industrial partners for the new studio to tap
for investment.
Hollywood rumour-mongers have already started to round up likely suspects.
Microsoft, the software giant, is at the top of the list.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Dixons to open specialist stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, is launching a new store
called The Link, claimed to be the first specialist retailer of a range of
communications, entertainment and information networks and services.
Although it will also sell equipment, The Link's main focus will be helping
customers select and sign-up to services such as mobile telephone networks,
satellite and cable television networks and on-line computer services - the
first time all these services have been marketed under one roof.
Dixons says that being a retailer of the latest technology means more than
selling hardware such as video recorders or computers. It also means
combining access to a network with a piece of equipment. This calls for a
different store environment, with information and demonstrations provided by
specialist staff.
'These products and services will be one of the fastest-growing consumer
markets of the next few years', says John Clare, Dixons' chief executive.
Sarah Carpenter, special projects director at Dixons, says The Link is
unlike any retail format she has encountered in Europe or the US. It could
help Dixons become a leading marketeer of interactive communications
services as these develop. The group is opening four Link stores in the
London area, starting with Kingston on October 31, then Enfield, Chiswick
and Lewisham. Four more open next February and the group will decide next
May whether to extend the chain.
Although it acquired the Currys and PC World chains, and Silo in the US  -
later sold - this is the first time Dixons has launched a new concept. Ideas
for The Link developed out of plans for a mobile telephone
shop.
Stores will have large central desks, giving customers space to fill in
applications for services, assisted by staff. The walls will carry
information boards and hardware that can be tried out. A mobile
communications area will offer details of consumer equipment, networks and
tariffs - including Mercury One2One, Orange, Cellnet and Vodafone.
The pager area will offer both conventional pagers and services, and new
'calling-party pays' pagers, such as Mercury MiniCall and Swatch's new
wristwatch pager, The Beep. A section devoted to satellite television will
include five bays where customers can view different channels. Dixons hopes
later to include cable TV operators.
A telephone area will sell a wide range of faxes, and will also market BT
network services, such as call waiting, call diversion, and caller number
display - the first time BT has sold such services through a third party.
A final section will be devoted to on-line computer services, including
Delphi and CompuServe - both offering exclusive services such as computer
shopping, plus a gateway to Internet, the global computer network - and
Tel-me, a network aimed at business users.
Dixons has not always enjoyed the best reputation for customer service, but
says The Link's staff have been specially selected and given a three-week
course including instruction by service providers.
Stores will earn a normal retail margin on hardware, and agency fees or
commission on sales of services.
Sarah Carpenter says that Dixons was selling some services in its other
stores, but that these were not equipped to capitalise on the opportunity.
Many consumers signed-up for services in specialist outlets, some run by
service-providers themselves, or answered ads in newspapers or magazines.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Media Futures: DEC tests over the Internet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No intelligent consumer would buy a car without first taking it for a
test-drive. So what about computer products? Car buyers go to a showroom
when they want to try a new model, but buyers of computer systems can now
evaluate hardware or software without ever leaving their desks.
Digital Equipment Corporation, the US computer maker, is allowing users of
the Internet, the self-regulating global computer network, to test the
company's Alpha computers by using their own software programs on its
hardware. Without having to go near the machines, users, via the Internet,
can tap into one of four Alpha computers located in the US.
By activating a standard Internet file transfer protocol, they can then
transfer their software to a DEC machine and effectively use the hardware
from any range.
So far, more than 7,500 users internationally have logged-on to try out DEC
machines and test its product claims of speed and efficiency.
James Bishop, faculty fellow in the department of physics at the University
of Notre Dame, Indiana, says that when hardware had to be shipped to
customers for testing, time was wasted.
The scheme also reduces DEC's marketing costs. 'We only have to manage a
handful of machines connected to the Internet, rather than running many
systems in the marketplace, or loaning out a large inventory,' says Russ
Jones, DEC's marketing manager. Some users log on to the Alpha system in
order to test their own programs. Software developers, for example, use DEC
machinery to evaluate new codes before attempting to market them, while
software users use Alpha equipment to check for bugs in their own systems.
'We have been encountering problems in running certain software on our
systems,' says Ignacio Lizardo, an engineer at United Technologies
Corporation's chemical systems division in San Jose, California. 'By
transferring our program codes to the DEC systems we can determine if it is
a problem with our system or see if we need to make hardware upgrades.'
DEC believes the Internet allows for more rigorous testing of its products.
'The fact that it is in the public domain on the Internet allows people to
satisfy themselves that it is a robust system when they combine the hardware
with their own software,' says Olivier DeWandre, programme manager for
education and research at DEC Europe.
Software buyers can also test packages before they hand over their cash.
Unipalm, the UK's largest provider of Internet connections, allows network
users to run several programs via the Internet before deciding to purchase.
Users who want an evaluation copy of a software program are given a 'key' -
not unlike an ATM pin number - that allows them to download programs on to
their systems. The programs are 'time-bombed' so that they work only for a
limited period. 'If you like the program you get in touch with us and we
will sell you a permanent key,' says a Unipalm spokesman.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Airline strike ends
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scandinavian Airlines System's check-in staff in Copenhagen have ended a
three-day wildcat strike that grounded most of the carrier's European
flights. The stoppage ended after an arbitration court agreed to discuss the
strikers' demands and told them to resume work, officials said.
The airline, jointly owned by Sweden, Denmark and Norway, said its
inter-continental and domestic flights were not affected by the action, nor
were other airlines. About 800 employees stopped work last Wednesday,
protesting at the carrier's refusal to re-instate a union official who had
been fired.

A new British airline is due to start daily non-stop Airbus A320 flights
from London's Heathrow to Beirut on October 28, with return fares starting
at Pounds 349. In doing so, it is banking on continuing peace in formerly
war-torn Lebanon.
The airline, British Mediterranean Airways, is backed by a
British-Italian-Argentinian consortium.
'Three years of peace have seen stability return and Lebanon is once again
set to attract large volumes of trade and tourism', an airline spokesman

largest engineering project. The five-mile tunnel is part of a rail and road
link across the strait that separates Copenhagen on the main Baltic island
of Zealand, from the Jutland peninsula.
The last part of the DKr21.6bn (Pounds 2.27bn) project, a road bridge which
will connect Zealand to the island of Sprogo, is under construction. Trains
are expected to cross the Great Belt in 1996, and road traffic the year

The US visa waiver programme, which was due to end this month, has now been

The programme allows the nationals of most European Union countries to
travel to the US without a visa, provided they stay for less than 90 days.
Journalists and government officials continue to need a visa.
The legislation to extend the programme had been held up in Congress but has

FT  17 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Dream of luxury loses its appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Airline executives are the first to admit that travelling business class on
short European flights these days is an expensive way to drink champagne.
This unexpected candour from an industry which relies on selling dreams of
luxury travel that rarely live up to reality is no sudden accident. In
recent months, airlines have become increasingly worried by the continuing
migration of their most profitable business customers to the economy cabins
on their European services.
During the past four recession-hit years, many business travellers were
forced by rigid company budgets to abandon first- or business-class air
travel. But with signs of economic recovery, many airlines were hoping to
see business travellers flock back to business class.
Although first- and business-class traffic has picked up, especially on
long-distance, intercontinental flights, there has been no great rush to
return to the business cabin in Europe. The reason is simple: businessmen
still find it hard to justify the heavy club-class premium on short flights.
A survey by the Gemini Consulting group of 50 leaders in the European
aviation industry shows airlines acutely aware of the challenge facing them.
What they have to do, the airlines now realise, is rekindle passenger
enthusiasm for air travel through product development and innovation.
Kieron Brennan, the Gemini vice-president who conducted the survey, says
that all the airline executives interviewed agree that the European industry
now has to adapt to a much more consumer-driven market.
'We've always said we were customer-focused, but over the next couple of
years we are really going to have to prove it,' explains one respondent.
Another says: 'In the US the customer plays a key role in pushing for lower
fares. In Europe there is no visible consumer movement yet, although we're
beginning to see the signs on the most competitive routes.'
Many feel that consumer demand rather than European air transport
liberalisation will become the driving force for change. 'Airlines are
adapting to the same change in consumer attitudes that has taken place in
the car industry,' says Brennan. 'A few years ago people were proud to pay a
premium to buy a Mercedes. They are now proud to pay less for a Lexus.'
Airlines, it is acknowledged, will only survive if they respond to the
demands of air travellers. 'We used to think that liberalisation would
create the environment to change. Now we believe the customer will. The
customer has less loyalty to flag-carriers than governments have,' remarks
one respondent.
An airline executive adds: 'The whole industry has been run for too long by
aviation enthusiasts and civil servants. It's now time for a consumer-led,
businesslike culture.'
The survey shows that the majority of respondents expect only one in five
passengers to travel business class by 2000.
Competition for business passengers on long-distance flights has already led
to significant changes in inflight services and products. An increasing
number of airlines have dropped their first-class cabins on transcontinental
routes; instead they offer first-class service at business-class fare.
In Europe, however, airlines are still offering 'an economy service at a
business-class fare', as one airline executive puts it. Many travellers who
fly business class on long-haul flights feel cheated by European
business-class standards and prices after being treated like kings on
transatlantic flights, Brennan says.
In future, European business-class passengers will have to be offered a
wider menu of value-added services (for example, baggage collection and
delivery, improved lounges, better seating, chauffeur services). Airlines
will also have to speed up their rate of product innovation and continually
upgrade and improve business-class services.
'It simply won't be sufficient to launch with great fanfare a complete
revamp of business class and then do nothing more for five years,' says
Brennan. British Airways, for example, has just announced a Pounds 70m
relaunch of its Club Europe business-class services. And high time. The
original Club Europe brand was launched in 1988.
Many airlines already offer some of these new and enhanced services. But the
survey suggests that the airlines' offerings are - at best - patchy and
fragmented. Such services are integrated only weakly with the airlines'
sales and distribution channels, says the report, so that only the most
assiduous customers can find out about them.
As one executive traveller says: 'I look forward to the day I am treated as
well as a UPS or DHL parcel.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Rooms with a budget price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European business travellers who hope their employers will allow them to
return to luxury hotels now the recession is over should prepare themselves
for some depressing news. All over Europe, hotel companies are convinced
they are about to see a rapid increase in demand for the sort of budget
hotel that has a Happy Eater restaurant attached to it.
Forte, which owns the Happy Eater chain, is rapidly expanding its budget
hotel business. It is building 22 new Travelodge hotels in the UK this year,
bringing the total to 114. In 1990, Forte had only 50 Travelodge hotels in
the UK. A room in a Travelodge costs Pounds 33.50 a night.
Forte is due to open two new Travelodges in Spain over the next three
months. It already has two in Ireland and four in France.
Holiday Inn is working with franchisees and joint-venture partners to build
60 Holiday Inn Express hotels in Europe over five years. The hotels will be
in Germany, Poland and the UK and will charge Pounds 39 a night, including
continental breakfast.
France has the most advanced budget hotel industry in Europe, but Forte and
Holiday Inn believe the rest of the continent is about to catch up. John
Miller, sales and marketing director of Forte's roadside restaurants
business, says about 15 per cent of hotel rooms in France are in the budget
category. In the US, the figure is 25 per cent. In the UK, it is only 3 per
cent.
France's budget hotels cover a wide range. At the Formule 1 chain, run by
Accor, guests share bathrooms and pay FFr130 (Pounds 15.50) a night. Miller
does not think UK travellers would put up with shared bathrooms. Mr
Jean-Claude Luttmann, co-chairman of Formule 1, thinks he might be right.
Accor has opened three Formule 1 hotels in the UK, but they have not been a
success. The company has done better in France, where it has nearly 300.
Accor's 400 Ibis hotels, which have private bathrooms and charge FFr260
(Pounds 31) a night, are probably closer competitors to Travelodge and
Holiday Inn Express.
Forte's Travelodge rooms are built in a factory and then assembled on site.
They have en-suite bathrooms, but no telephones, although the company is
considering installing them. Holiday Inn Express hotels will have
telephones.
While the hotel chains are convinced demand for these products is rising,
they concede that some business travellers will escape them and stay
somewhere more expensive.
Miller believes junior staff who were not allowed to travel during the
recession will now stay in Travelodges. Tim Clarke, managing director of
Holiday Inn in Europe, says the Express hotels will be for travellers
arriving late.

Rugby League. October 22, Great Britain v Australia, first John Smith's
Test, Wembley.
It was a shock, in 1982, when the fitness and technical ability of
Australia's touring side took British rugby league by surprise. This year
their style of play has been a shock too, for the Kangaroos' machine-like
qualities - grinding down opposition attacks and ruthlessly punishing
mistakes - have played second fiddle to fluent attacking rugby. So far they
have moved the ball so often and at such speed that, despite an
uncharacteristic number of handling errors, they have swept aside the
strongest club sides in Britain. The question is: will they continue this
swashbuckling approach at Wembley or revert to error-free football. Great
Britain, who proved their strength last
year with victory over New Zealand, have brought in Wigan's Shaun Edwards as
captain - a blow for Garry Schofield of Leeds who lost the job just two
Tests short
of equalling Mick Sullivan's
record of 46 appearances for his country.
Football. Uefa Cup, October 18, Trabzonspor v Aston Villa. European Cup,
October 19, Manchester United v Barcelona. European Cup Winners' Cup,
October 20, Brondby v Arsenal and Chelsea v Austria Vienna.
Johan Cruyff threatens 'all-out attack' by Barcelona when they visit
Manchester United in the European Champions' League. In truth they have
little choice: Barcelona, initially the bookmakers' favourites to win
United's qualifying group, surprisingly lost their previous game to
Gothenburg and now lie third in the table. As for United, manager Alex
Ferguson is not taking the threat lightly. 'Their names, that's the mental
thing we've got to conquer,' he says. 'We've all got a thing about names.
Romario, Stoichkov, Hagi - you are more frightened of the names than what
they actually do.'
In the Cup Winners' Cup, Arsenal are away to Brondby, of Denmark, while
Chelsea are at home to FK Austria Vienna. Arsenal swapped home and away
dates to avoid their fans travelling to Europe at the same time and on
almost an identical route to Chelsea's.
After their memorable victory over holders Internazionale Milan in the last
round of the Uefa Cup, Aston Villa travel to Trabzonspor of Turkey.
Boxing. October 23, WBO heavyweight title, Herbie Hide v Tommy Morrison; WBO
middleweight title, Steve Collins v Lonny Besley; IBF lightweight title,
Rafael Ruelas v Billy Schwer; non-title fight, Frank Bruno v Ray Mercer.
Hong Kong.
When Oliver McCall took Lennox Lewis's WBC world title last month, McCall's
promoter, Don King, once again gained virtual control of the profitable
world heavyweight title business. King's first move against the Lewis camp
was to announce that McCall may defend his crown against Lewis's old British
rival, Frank Bruno. It would be Bruno's fourth attempt at winning a world
crown. But he must first beat Ray Mercer, who once stopped Tommy Morrison,
the challenger for Herbie Hide's WBO title on the same Hong Kong bill.

As the first British monarch sets foot on Russian soil, the most extensive
profile of her kinsman, Tsar Nicholas II, hits the screen. Network First
(Tuesday, 10.40-11.40pm, ITV) got access to personal papers, diaries,
photographs and archive footage which have never been aired. There are also
interviews with witnesses who may not live to tell their story again - one
is 112.
The first of a two-parter, this is an exhaustive study, introduced by Prince
Michael of Kent, who adds little to the programme apart from his uncanny
resemblance to his kinsman.
Insurance companies are accused of entrapment, intimidation and deception by
Dispatches (Wednesday, 9.00-9.45pm, C4), which investigates the ruses used
to avoid paying personal injury claims. The current affairs programme
interviews people who have had detectives prying into their lives by posing
as market researchers or simply by camping out in the front garden.
What are a high-ranking policeman's career choices when the attorney-general
instigates criminal charges against him? That's the question facing Tony
Clark with the return of the award-laden cop show Between The Lines
(Wednesday, 9.30-10.25pm, BBC1). Even prospective pub managers, security
guards and store detectives need references, and Clark doesn't have them. A
taut thriller with more twists and counter-twists than a helter-skelter.
Ford Transits claim half the British market for vans, but when they were
launched in 1965 - the first collaboration between Ford in Britain and its
German counterpart - they were considered outlandish and unsellable. A new
series, Perpetual Motion (Friday, 8.30-9.00pm, BBC2), looks at lovable
vehicles, starting with the Ford Transit - friend of burglars and police
patrols alike - and progressing to the Ferguson TE Tractor, Concorde and the
electric milk float.
The home of too many spoof chat shows launches a series that isn't a parody
of the genre with Last Word (Saturday, 11.00-11.45pm, BBC2). Hosted by
Germaine Greer, all the guests will be women, with contributions from Ann
Leslie, Suzanne Moore, Janet Street-Porter and Miranda Sawyer. Greer
promises to enrage and engage, and topics will include: 'What exactly are
women for?'
The highest-earning woman in the world, Madonna, meets the woman with the
lowest embarrasment threshold in Ruby Wax (Sunday, 10.05-10.35pm, BBC1).
With the shrewd pop singer hitting a run of bad luck in the last couple of
years, there is plenty to talk about. You can bet Wax won't hesitate to ask
the most probing posers.

The question occupying most sensible UK filmgoers at present is: 'How do we
avoid seeing Forrest Gump even though all our friends are going?'
Here are some suggestions. Tell your friends you have it on good authority
(FT film critic) that Gump is a long, winsome, platitudinous piece of
Hollywoodiana. Then move smartly off in the direction of Pulp Fiction.
All the things said against Quentin Tarantino's Cannes Golden Palm-winning
thriller, opening this week, are true. It is violent, amoral, foul-mouthed
and drugs-obsessed, and, as a piece of action cinema, it makes the same
director's Reservoir Dogs look like Lady and the Tramp. In addition, its
mongrel cast - John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel -
spend 2 1/2 hours trying to make sense of a four-stories-in-one screenplay.
But the things said for the film are also true. Tarantino has a gift for
black comedy unsurpassed in modern film-making and a wild pop-art eloquence
as a dialogue writer. Try the film yourself. If you are worried about what
to do with Aunt Edna, drop her off at Forrest Gump.
On no account let her stay at home with most of the new video releases. They
include the cheerfully OTT Mafia comedy Romeo Is Bleeding (Gary Oldman as a
violent Mob trouble-shooter) and the good-in-parts gothic gore fantasy
Necronomicon. But they also include the hauntingly beautiful Vietnamese film
The Scent Of Green Papaya. Tran Anh Hung's meditation-in-miniature on loss,
love and family,filmed entirely inside a French studio, was a hit of last
year's festival season. It is slow, sensual and lyrically-shot: a painting
come to life.
Other good news for Aunt Edna. The Client, opening this week, is a clean and
decent John Grisham thriller about a boy witness caught in a trial-room tug
of war. And that chaste and charming comedy, Four Weddings And a Funeral, is
still showing, having become the highest-earning British film ever (Dollars
200m worldwide). This means that all those subsidy-obsessed British film
people who keep crying out for lucrative grants now have one: Hugh Grant.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Sport: Seve - the showman in suburbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wentworth in autumn. Low October sun filtering through the lofty pines
bordering the fairways. Cossetted greens playing like the billiard tables
they resemble. At their expensive best, England's suburban golf courses are
a tableau to match Scotland's wildest links. Odd that golf's most savage
event has made its home in Surrey.
Compared with the refined niceties of a four-day strokeplay tournament,
matchplay is sudden-death, hand-to-hand combat. Indeed, Toyota's World
Matchplay championship at Wentworth is the only event of its type on golf's
international calendar. Twelve of the world's top players commence battle,
two by two, on Thursday morning. By Sunday night only the winner survives.
As they move around the celebrated Burma Road course, the competitors seem
to be caught in a spotlight that reveals their innermost natures. Its brutal
light can seem to blind the technicians, inspire the showmen, and none fits
the latter description better than Spain's Seve Ballesteros. Irrespective of
what came later, his first-day performance at Wentworth was a triumph of
obstacles overcome. An enormous gallery followed his every move, their
intense clapping of each holed putt echoing like the noise of a battalion of
woodpeckers.
A week earlier, Ballesteros could hardly move. He was bruised and scarred
after falling from his mountain bike near his home in Pedrena. Then he had
to get himself invited to Wentworth, hurdling the disinterest of the
organiser, IMG, which had previously preferred the attractions of American
rascal John Daly. A year ago Seve was a natural to snub. Since then he has
been re-born, lies second on the European money list with a total of Pounds
454,848, and two weeks ago won the tough German Masters after a play-off
against Ernie Els and his friend and compatriot, Jose Maria Olazabal.
Naturally, he thought that five wins in 18 appearances at Wentworth earned
him an entry ticket. Until Daly dropped out in favour of de-tox, IMG thought
otherwise. Then, in the first round, Seve was drawn against David Frost.
Last year at Wentworth the same pairing saw the rampant South African thrash
a distraught Ballesteros 7 and 6. It was a savage end to a 1993 season spent
bumping along the bottom.
Last year, Seve left Surrey mentally and physically broken. This year he was
a new man, surfing the adoration of the huge first-day Wentworth crowd to
beat Frost by an even bigger margin than he himself suffered last year .
'Irrespective of who wins this tournament, that first day proved Seve
Ballesteros is the greatest matchplay golfer in the world,' said Colin
Montgomerie, thinking himself lucky to be in the other half of the draw. 'I
played Dave Frost in the Dunhill Cup and he's one of the most solid and
consisent performers on the circuit. To beat him 8 and 7 is nothing short of
incredible.'
Montgomerie's own demeanour in matchplay conditions is less comfortable. He
scowls and growls at the crowd like the angry lion cub he resembles. Several
times in his afternoon round against Yoshinori Mizumaki he let slip some
truly leonine yawns.
Matchplay is physically demanding, for two circuits of a 6,900-yard
championship course are a fair day's hike, even without the demands of
world-class competition. No other tournaments - except Ryder Cup, where
nationalism tends to fuel the players to extraordinary heights - demand 36
holes a day. Analysis of the Wentworth scorecard revealed some interesting
differences either side of noon on a typical day. In the morning rounds, the
outward nine holes saw 23 birdies or eagles and only five bogeys from the
four pairs. After lunch it was a different story - just 10 sub-par shots and
eight bogeys.
'Fatigue shouldn't really come into it. We're fit enough to walk a bit more
than 12,000 yards,' Mongomerie mused. 'But the pressure goes on for eight
hours, not just four. It's demanding but still a fairer process than 18
holes. You can't fluke a win over two whole rounds. That's why Test matches
are five days. Whoever is the better player will come through after 36
holes.'
Nick Faldo, who went into Wentworth a slightly surprising bookies' favourite
to win, despite an indifferent season, agreed that the 36-hold format was a
more serious examination of talent and application. On the pro tour, all
professional golfers dread the days when they drop a couple of shots in the
first few holes, then - before they know it - are on the 10th tee and
struggling to get back in the fray.
What stops the matchplay formula being more widely used? Golf's promoters,
it seems, fear the format's unpredictability. Stars can be turfed-out on the
first day. And an early run of 4-and-3 victories can mean that play finishes
early, leaving the holder of expensively-purchased television rights with
nothing to broadcast.
Until 1953, the US PGA was unique among the major titles in using a
matchplay format. That year Ben Hogan declined to play, choosing the
18-holes-a-day Open instead (40 years ago the dates clashed) so as to give
his legs a rest. Hogan appeared to start a trend. Some gladiatorial
personalities, however, will always prefer mano a mano. 'One of the reasons
I like matchplay so much is you don't have to keep a scorecard. That's the
hardest thing in golf, to keep the score,' said Ballesteros.

FT  17 OCT 94 / FT Guide to Game theories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHANIE FLANDERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week the Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to three 'game
theorists': John Harsanyi, John Nash and Rheinhard Selten. What is game
theory?
Game theory is about how people make decisions when they have to take other
people's responses into account. Businessmen often have to make this type of
calculation - whether or not it makes sense to enter a new market, for
example, or lower prices, may depend on how other companies react.
Politicians, trades unions and parents all come up against the same thing
whenever achieving a desired result means correctly guessing how others will
respond. Before game theory, economists had observed interactive
decision-making in the real world, but there were no general models for
examining the way people were likely to behave.
Where do the games fit in? Do game theorists really think life is like
poker?
Not really. Most of the games used are not games people play, but stylised
models which capture some element of the theory. The 'prisoner's dilemma',
probably the best-known game, is a case in point. Strictly speaking it is
not a game but a paradox about co-operation. The original, as conceived by
Albert Tucker in 1950, describes two men getting arrested for a crime. After
locking them in separate cells, the sheriff explains that they can either
confess to committing the crime with the other man, or refuse. If neither
confesses, both will get two years in jail. If only one confesses, he will
go free while his accomplice gets 12 years. If both confess, however, each
will get four years. The problem is that each will inevitably confess, even
though they would both be better off if neither talked.
Does game theory provide an answer to the paradox?
In technical terms, the outcome is a 'Nash equilibrium'. This means that
each prisoner would choose to confess even if he knew what his friend had
decided to do. Elements of the prisoner's dilemma crop up a lot in real
life. Take cartels. In order to keep prices artificially high, all producers
might agree to produce only a certain quantity of goods. Afterwards,
however, it makes sense for each producer to try to gain extra profit by
over-producing. In the end, all lose out because the price stays low. Game
theorists do not really resolve problems like this, but they provide formal
ways of analysing them.
How does that help? Can you learn anything if you don't understand the
maths?
By abstracting from the details of particular cases, the models can
sometimes identify ways to change the game to deliver a better outcome.
Allowing the game to be repeated, for example, may help the players get it
right the next time. In the case of the cartel, producers might behave
differently if they believed they would need to deal with the other
producers again. Another possible solution is to change the 'pay-off
structure', so that each individual faces a higher penalty if he or she
decides to renege on the deal. At its simplest, game theory shows that
individual incentives matter. Sometimes the lesson is to change the
incentives to get a better result. At other times it shows that the players
would be better off not playing the game at all.
It still sounds rather abstract. Are there any specific cases where game
theory has been used?
Game theory is still a relatively young field. John von Neumann and Oskar
Morganstern introduced many of the central ideas in a book published in
1944. Most of the work since has been devoted to refining their ideas to
produce a more sophisticated set of theoretical tools. But academics from
other fields have applied the analysis more broadly. Henry Kissinger was one
of the pioneers, using ideas from game theory in studies of international
diplomacy in the early 1960s. Business strategists, political scientists and
macro-economists have followed, using the same techniques to analyse
anything from industrial disputes to negotiating international environmental
agreements.
Give me specific cases.
Game theory is hampered by the fact that the models themselves are very
difficult for non-specialists to follow. But in a sense, the lessons of the
theory are everywhere. UK long-term interest rates are currently higher than
they might be, because Britain's chancellor of the exchequer cannot credibly
commit himself to never inflating the economy for short-term political gain.
Costly strikes happen because neither workers nor employers can trust the
claims of the other side. Game theory has explained why these games are
lost; it has yet to show how to win them.

Those who cannot get enough of Cecilia Bartoli, the young Roman
mezzo-soprano who has risen to super-stardom with disarming ease, should
enjoy Mozart Portraits (Decca), her second selection of arias by the great
man, taken principally from Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cosi Fan
Tutte. Her voice sounds as fresh as ever, and she is accompanied with great
assurance by Gyorgy Fischer and the Vienna Chamber Orchestra. No major
surprises, but more than enough to be getting on with.
'We have always been adamant about unreleased songs - leave them be', notes
Abba frontman Bjorn Ulvaeus in the publicity leaflet advertising ...a new
4-CD collectors' set of the group's greatest hits and unreleased material.
Thank You for the Music (Polydor) is a definitive 66-track collection of the
sounds which helped inspire the 1970s revival. At least Bjorn has the grace
to admit that 'if it wasn't for some of the stage outfits, these memories
would be almost unblemished ..'
It is a big week for confessions. That other heavyweight of the '70s scene,
Barry White, reveals: 'I believe that some people are children of destiny
 .my destiny has been music.' This is to prepare us for The Icon is Love
(A&amp;M): a solid enough collection of songs, preferable by far to the slight
sounds of Jamiroquai, whose The Return of the Space Cowboy (Sony S2) is a
telling illustration of the insipid nature of today's dance music. A UK tour
starts next Monday at Cardiff University.
The former Yes singer and pretentious lyric-writer Jon Anderson has teamed
up with the London Chamber Academy, directed by Christopher Warren Green,
for Change We Must (EMI), a collection of new 'cross-over' interpretations
of Yes and Vangelis numbers which is, in all honesty, unlikely to win him
any new followers.
Top of the classical album charts in Australia recently was that country's
leading soprano, Yvonne Kenny, with Simple Gifts (ABC), a cluster of
operatic arias and popular songs which has now been released in Britain.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Management: Robomom to keep the kids in check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stirring news from Singapore: inventor Steven Chan has launched a Pounds 55
gadget, called Robomom, to help families control the amount of time their
children watch TV. Robomom is a tamper-proof 'electronic telesitter' that
automatically turns your set off after a certain time - a 'form of
electronic agreement between parent and child' that is said to be more
sophisticated than existing gadgets.
Robomom uses a system of 'time credits' that start to be deducted once the
set is turned on. After a sales push in Singapore, the inventor and his
company, Informatics Engineering, hope to export Robomom to Japan and
America, then elsewhere.
What a useful gadget. And what a huge market robots will become - trillions,
I shouldn't wonder, by 2025. Wilfred Thesiger, the famed explorer, curses
the arrival of machines, even cars and telephones. But Thesiger is old and
disillusioned, whereas some, like me, have no fear of robots, even though
one day they will completely outstrip us. In the history of earthly
intelligence, robots will be our heirs.
Before that happens, I want them to be my friends. I want a Robomom to
control the amount of crap I watch on TV. I also want a robofriend to
remonstrate with me every time I behave arrogantly or selfishly. I need lots
of robofriends and will pay good money to get them.
The row over Unilever's Persil Power is still boiling busily, after all
these weeks. Persil Power is the new-generation detergent that gave some of
your washing a bit of a thrashing because it contains a substance (manganese
catalyst accelerator) that cuts up rough in extreme conditions. Unilever
relaunched Persil Power, and claims that the problem has been remedied.
Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever's arch enemy, has ripped into Unilever. And
Unilever - prissily - has agreed that 'somewhere between research and
marketing, something went wrong'. But I wonder if Unilever's marketing
department and advertising agency are failing to spot a wonderful trick.
Years ago I was shown around Unilever's research laboratories at Port
Sunlight, in the north of England. Everywhere I looked, washing machines and
driers churned and whizzed. The researchers I was introduced to were
preternaturally brainy. There were equations on black-boards.
It was very hush-hush. The stuff they were testing was doubtless a meek
ancestor of Persil Power.
As a result of that visit, I came to appreciate the intense technological
and marketing effort that underpins the dull-sounding, but in fact manically
competitive, detergents market. Europe: Pounds 6bn a year.
But I have a small problem. My clothes last too long. I create no friction,
so they never wear out. Some of them are older than Michael Portillo. I want
them to shred and rot, so I can buy some new ones. I need Persil Power in
its original formulation, or even something zanier: Persil Splatt]] With
vicious Persil Splatt]] I could become a new person.
Unilever should stop apologising and switch to the attack.
It is easy to tease newspapers about their smugness and sluggishness. Jon
Katz, a US media critic, wrote recently in Wired magazine that newspapers
were besieged. 'Television has stolen much of their news, magazines their
advertisers and best writers, cable many of their younger readers. And the
digital revolution has pushed them still closer to the wall.' Newspapers
were 'the biggest and saddest losers in the information revolution. . .our
least hip medium, relentlessly one-way, non-interactive.'
Katz is unimpressed by newspapers' efforts to join the media revolution. So
far, he says, on-line newspapers do not work conceptually or commercially.
With few exceptions they seem to be expensive hedges against on-rushing
technology with little rationale of their own.
We have heard all this before. But Katz doesn't think that newspapers are
doomed to early wipe-out, even though they need to re-attract an alienated
public. If newspapers are to invest heavily in anything, he says, perhaps it
ought to be in younger, more talented, more diverse staffs so that they can
rediscover their vibrancy and relevance.
I agree. I believe that newspapers will still be around when man is on Mars.
But they need their own revolution. My crystal ball shows enormous clouds of
advertising expenditure forming and massing, like inter-stellar gas, and
sweeping this way. But to claim their share, newspapers must spend mightily.
They will have to bid competitively against other media for the best
writers, editors, investigative reporters, commentators and analysts, and
for those rare souls who can inject pace, flair, quirkiness, eccentricity
and fractiousness into newspapers' tired veins. This sort of thing is called
old-product development. It can be just as exciting as Persil Splatt]]

FT  17 OCT 94 / Management: The real face of Japanese R&amp;D in Europe -
Christopher Lorenz examines why so few companies are doing integrated
product development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guildford, a cathedral town in southern England, is an unlikely birthplace
for an innovation which may revolutionise the world computer graphics
industry. But Criterion Software, a 17-person company which was founded
there last year, has launched a product which enables standard personal
computers to produce three-dimensional graphics of a quality and speed
hitherto feasible only on specialised and very expensive workstations.
The reaction of the US software and multimedia industry, and of computer
games programmers worldwide, has been one of disbelief followed by great
excitement. The product, called RenderWare, is being bought by a string of
leading software development houses and hardware makers. Unless Criterion's
growth is crippled by the established leaders of the graphics industry as
they rush to clone its approach, the company's sales should climb rapidly
from this year's Pounds 1.5m.
The Guildford company is also remarkable for a quite different reason. It is
the second, fully-fledged new business to be spawned in just three years by
the European research and development centre which Canon, the Japanese
copier and camera maker, opened on Surrey University's research park there
in 1988.
The first spin-off was Canon Audio, whose innovative, hemlet-shaped hi-fi
loudspeakers are impressing the specialist music trade. Sales are expected
to grow from Pounds 3m this year to Pounds 5m in 1995. Exports to the US
have already started, with Japan next on the list.
Most other Japanese R&amp;D establishments in Europe, with the notable
exceptions of Sony's and Nissan's, are more limited than Canon's. They are
of two very different kinds. One 'upstream' group, also located in or near
universities, monitors or actually conducts local research, mainly for
transfer to Japan. The other, housed in or alongside Japanese factories in
Europe, operates very much 'downstream', merely adapting product designs
from Japan for local manufacture and sale.
In theory, both kinds of operation are likely to expand gradually into the
same central, or 'midstream', territory as Canon: the design, development
and engineering of products for global markets. This closely linked set of
activities creates more added value than either research or manufacture do
on their own. Yet it receives far less media attention: the headlines are
hogged by investments such as NEC's Pounds 530m new semiconductor factory in
Scotland - announced last month.
Many academics and government officials think the trend towards the
midstream will occur automatically, as a series of pressures forces Japanese
companies to do more design, development and engineering abroad. Apart from
politics, pressures include the rising yen, the cost and supply of local
engineers, the need to generate product designs direct from European
markets, and a supposedly 'natural' cycle of organisational evolution among
multinationals of any origin.
Declarations of intent to join this trend have been made by Sharp and a few
other Japanese companies which at present do only research or production in
Europe. But the process is far less automatic than many people think.
Organisational and other factors are hampering such an expansion of design,
development and engineering away from the companies' home base.
One long-standing barrier is the near-universal tendency to keep really key
R&amp;D programmes close to head office. Masahisa Fujita, a professor at the
University of Pennsylvania, says this applies especially in fast-moving
technologies such as electronics - the very sector which accounts for most
Japanese manufacturing companies in Europe.
Extra brakes on more Japanese heading for Europe include three options which
did not exist for the Americans: first, locating in south-east Asia, or
indeed the US; Japanese spending on R,D&amp;D is already far greater in the US
than in Europe, and growing faster. Second, doing more foreign design and
development through alliances, rather than in-house. Third, subcontracting
more work to the growing plethora of development consultancies in Europe and
the US.
The last two options - part of a gathering surge of so-called 'virtual R&amp;D'
around the world - will still benefit Europe in various ways. But the
commitment is less far reaching than when a Japanese company invests in its
own European design and development facilities.
The contrast between Canon's approach and that of most other Japanese
companies was underlined this summer at the ninth annual conference of the
UK-Japan High Technology Industry Forum, held at Gleneagles in Scotland. Of
four presentations in a session titled 'Japanese R&amp;D in the UK', Canon's was
the only one to deal with the complete process of innovation, including
commercialisation.
The other three companies at Gleneagles were Toshiba and Hitachi, both of
which have basic research centres in Cambridge working on quantum physics
with the university's Cavendish laboratory, and Eisai, a drugs company which
is spending Pounds 50m on a neurosciences lab at University College London.
'Once we prove a project to be worth exploiting, it will be continued in
Japan,' the conference was told by Yutaka Tsuchiya, the lab's administration
director.
By coincidence, the one-in-four ratio at Gleneagles reflects - slightly
generously - the proportion of Japanese 'R&amp;D' units in the UK which do more
than either just basic research or local modification of products. In
continental Europe, the proportion is less favourable still.
According to the latest official government figures from Tokyo, Japanese
companies claim to have no fewer than 264 'R&amp;D facilities' in Europe. The UK
has the largest number, 83, followed by Germany with 53.
Kiyonori Sakakibara, an expert on international R&amp;D based at the London
Business School, confirms that the UK figure - and, by implication, the
German one - 'is an over-estimate. It includes all sorts of preliminary
technical activities'.
A better indication of the amount of real Japanese R,D&amp;D in Europe is the
figure of 65 units which are classified as 'independent', or not
factory-based; 19 of them are based in the UK, 18 in Germany.
But even this classification is confusing. It mainly covers research units,
including the three which presented at Gleneagles. But it also includes
Nissan's European Technical (development) Centre north of London and NSK's
ball-bearing facility near Nottingham, which are both linked to the
companies' factories in the UK and elsewhere.
Some of the reasons for doubting whether research operations will move
downstream into design and development as automatically or smoothly as
theorists suggest are examined by Sakakibara and Eleanor Westney of MIT in a
paper on the evolution of cross-border technology management by Japanese
companies.*
One discouragement lies in the long success which many companies have had in
collecting foreign technology for use in their laboratories back home. Even
when top management makes a strategic commitment to push more real product
development abroad, established relationships and patterns of communication
lead the home country R&amp;D organisation to continue treating the growing
local unit as just a listening post, say the academics.
As a result, the unit finds it difficult to recruit and keep good local
technical people. 'This difficulty reinforces the belief of the home country
organisation that the local (unit) can never match the product development
capacity in Japan,' say Sakakibara and Westney. A very strong commitment by
top technical management is needed to overcome this problem, they argue.
That may not be enough. Arnoud de Meyer, a professor at Insead in France,
identifies a similar impediment, involving managers and technical staff at
all levels. Foreign R&amp;D centres take an inordinate time to establish
credibility with staff at their home country bases, he says. The French R&amp;D
unit of Corning, a large American multinational took from 1969 to 1981 to
win its spurs; it only did so when one of its research projects became a big
commercial success.
A further barrier cited by de Meyer is communication difficulties between
foreign units and those at home. Electronic communication of various kinds
is all very well, he says, but 'the thing companies don't understand is that
information only becomes knowledge if it's consensually validated - if you
can actually see people in the same room say yes or no, and feel how they
say it. You don't get that on an electronic network. Even teleconferencing
impairs the informality and openness which people need to work together in
complete trust.'
This is less a problem for stand-alone research units working on projects
separate from those in the home country than for product development units
working in an integrated fashion with the home base - and sometimes with
each other.
Although no Japanese company has yet had the time to develop as much
research, design or development activity in Europe as US multinationals such
as Ford or IBM, the Japanese are aware of these co-ordination problems.
As David Cairncross, a UK academic, points out in a new book on Japanese
multinationals**, most long-established US multinationals still do most of
their advanced design and development work at home. So it is not surprising
that the current level of 'real' Japanese activity in Europe is limited,
however great its potential.
By the same token R&amp;D spending abroad by Japanese companies is still
outranked considerably by expenditure by foreign companies in Japan. The
average size of foreign R&amp;D units in Japan is also much larger, Cairncross
reports: many have over 100 staff, whereas Japanese facilities in Europe and
the US employ between 10 and 50, except in the motor industry.
Time may change this balance, but only gradually. That makes Canon's two
spin-offs all the more striking. The true test of Canon's
internationalisation, as for other Japanese companies, will be if it manages
over the next decade or so to grow at least one big worldwide business based
on products designed and developed abroad. It has made a better start than
most.

Even in academic circles the name of this Bostonian polymath (1868-1933)
occasionally provokes the question 'Mary who?'.
Follett's posthumous fame, however, is growing and a new book due to be
published in January* seems certain to bring her work to a wider audience.
Peppered between extracts of her writings on conflict, power, leadership and
other issues moreover, are glowing testimonials from distinguished
authorities such as Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Peter Drucker, and Henry
Mintzberg.
'Follett's espousal of mutual problem solving foreshadows employee
involvement, participative management, quality circles and other team-based
approaches to involving the workforce in diagnosis, analysis and solution
finding,' says Moss Kanter.
Drucker enthuses: 'Every one of her comments is fresh, pertinent and
insightful, but her true importance lies in her vision. She saw the society
of organisations and she saw management as its generic function and specific
organ well before either really existed. . .She was the prophet of
management.'
A political scientist who never worked in business, Follett applied her
original ideas in the field of social work. She was profoundly interested in
the individual in groups and in society, developing a brand of democractic
governance based on participation and responsibility.
The seeds of late 20th century empowerment, cross functional thinking and
leadership styles are firmly planted in her writings.
On conflict she argued that differences of opinion and different interests
should not be pushed under the carpet; problems ought to be resolved jointly
through searching for an 'integrated' solution while imposed settlements,
however benevolent, were ultimately doomed to failure.
Follett was eagerly listened to by senior managers in the 1920s, She
developed her ideas in a series of lectures in New York in 1925 and just
before her death at the inauguration of the London School of Economics'
Department of Business Administration.
Her advocacy of conflict as a constructive and creative means of problem
solving and her criticisms of hierarchical structures were out of tune with
thinking after the second world war, and her ideas fell into neglect in the
west. Drucker rejects sexism as an explanation, Moss Kanter is not so sure.
The Japanese, however, were not so blinkered and incorporated much of
Follett's teaching into their management culture in the late 1950s.
Much of the credit for unearthing the Follett story deserves to go to
Pauline Graham, editor of the forthcoming book. Graham, now a freelance
lecturer and consultant in North London, discovered her 'mentor' in the mid
1960s.

A
After the golden age
APPLICATIONS
In retrospect, the late 1980s look to have been a golden age for European
business schools: between 1987 and 1990, for example, MBA student numbers
grew at an estimated compound rate of 18 per cent per annum in the UK.
Recent trends, though, have been more sobering. Recession, rising job
insecurity, and industry and media criticism of the MBA's relevance have
visibly checked the expansion of traditional full-time MBA programmes.
The question now is whether the 1994-95 student intake will turn the tide.
So far, the signs are mixed. In the UK Warwick says the number of applicants
for its one-year full-time MBA programme increased by 5-10 per cent this
year and predicts 'one of the best classes ever'. Lancaster is also upbeat,
reporting a 20 per cent increase in demand for the 50 places on its
full-time course - 'to levels higher than before the recession in 1990'.
Other schools indicate that there is an increase in the numbers actually
signing on of 4 to 20 per cent.
On the other hand, London Business School, the market leader in the UK,
accepted only 140 students for its two-year full-time programme beginning in
September, against 180 this time a year ago (a figure which itself was
slightly down on 1992). London, which points out that it still had more
applicants than last year, explains the fall by its determination to select
only top quality candidates.
Insead's September intake of 235 is marginally up on last year with Ms Helen
Henderson, the school's admissions director, reporting that candidates are
'better prepared and more committed' than at the end of
the 1980s; IMD considered expanding its MBA class to two sections but is
glad it did not: its 'conversion' rate is high with only 100 offers needed
to fill 83 places this year.
While part-time programmes have generally held up better to recession, the
tentative evidence so far this year is also mixed. The Association of MBAs
suggests some employers are more reluctant to sup port their employees with
the payment of fees. Reliable distance learning figures are even harder to
establish: Amba estimates that around 4,000 new students started programmes
in the UK in 1993-94, against more than 3,100 a year before. It is too early
to gauge demand for the 'class' of 1994-95.
The big issue is quality
ACCREDITATION
Given the proliferation of schools and courses, quality control is now a big
issue in western management educ- ation. In the US the American Assembly of
Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), which drastically revised its
criteria a couple of years ago, accredits most institutions offering the MBA
and other Masters of Management qualifications.
Europe has no single authority but the nearest equivalent is the UK-based
Association of MBAs (Amba), which administers an accreditation scheme linked
to a soft loan programme for UK students.
Amba has accredited roughly a third of the UK's 99 business schools, plus a
dozen of their leading continental European counterparts. Last year it
accredited a distance learning course for the first time.
As university institutions, UK business schools must be accredited by the
Higher Education Funding Councils, which are charged with assessing the
quality of teaching and research.
However, the funding councils' approach to inspection and assessment might
not be much help to applicants trying to choose a business school. For
teaching, the funding council for England separates university departments
into only three grades, one of which has not yet been used.
Every English business school's teaching is either 'excellent' or
'satisfactory', according to the council. Had any institution been found to
be 'unsatisfactory', the third available ranking, there would have been
serious questions over its future.
An 'excellent' rating is a genuine feather in an institution's cap, but
'satisfactory' is very broad.
B
Buzzwords buzz off
BUZZWORDS
Business schools are bursting at the seams with buzzwords.
'Internationalism', 'leadership', and 'soft skills' are three which are hard
to miss on most campuses at the moment.
The thing to remember is that many are fads - here today and gone tomorrow.
Seventy-five per cent of all quality circles begun with enthusiasm in the US
in 1982, for example, had been discontinued by 1986. The management writer
Richard Pascale neatly illustrated the point in his book Managing on the
Edge (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990) with a graph showing the ebbs and flows of
business fads based on the frequency of citations in academic literature.
C
Both sides of the case
CASE METHOD
The case study method is the best-known - and now possibly the most
controversial - form of teaching in business schools. Pioneered in the US
and closely identified with Harvard, the term case refers to a written
description of a business situation faced by a decision maker at some point
in time. Names, places and other details are sometimes disguised but they
are almost always based on real events and real people.
The case study method has also been widely adopted in Europe, where the
undergraduate business teaching approach has traditionally been instruction
based. 'We agree that cases are a very good simulation for future settings,'
says Mr Ludo Van der Heyden, codean of Insead, which along with IMD at
Lausanne is spearheading a drive to research and publish more cases about
European companies. 'We find that students remember them and the concept
they are meant to illustrate years later.'
Nevertheless, Mr Van der Heyden feels cases should not be over-used, that
they are sometimes too long, and that they should be a vehicle for
illustrating wider issues rather than reaching a specific solution. 'A good
case teacher will not discuss a case to death. In the middle of the class he
will start generalising and moving away from the case,' he suggests.
Insead, which also favours the use of simulated games to provide what Mr Van
der Heyden calls 'a more dynamic and controlled effect,' is harnessing
computer and video technology to produce what it calls 'business navigation
cases'. In this way the school believes students can better put themselves
in the dilemma of a chief executive - with access to much more information
than would be provided by a conventional paper case and faced with a more
'real-life like' range of variables.
Recent research by the European Foundation for Management Development -
based on a survey of 86 graduate schools that provided 141 MBA or management
programmes offering masters' degrees - showed that more emphasis will be put
on the case study method, group discussion and simulations and 'other
methods' during 1994-95 courses, and less on the lecture approach and
project work.
Short of breadth
COMPANY MBAS
These are MBAs tailored specifically for a single company and are another
peculiar feature of the UK market.
Very often, part of the course is taught by company staff, for which credits
are given, with the rest done by a partner business school or university.
Academics are often critical of company MBAs. Warwick Business School, for
example, takes the view that 'single-company or single occupation MBA
programmes diminish not only that MBA programme but also its value to
students'.
Warwick argues that 'the fulcrum of the MBA's value is its breadth', breadth
which comes both from the way courses are designed and from having a rich
mix of class members whose varied backgrounds add to the learning
experience.
Among those schools active in the company specific field is Henley, with 22
programmes running at the moment for, among others, BICC, Grand Met and
Standard Chartered Bank. Lancaster runs single company MBA programmes for
British Airways and VSEL.
The club sandwich
CONSORTIUM MBA
This is really a compromise between the company MBA and a standard full-time
or part-time degree open to everyone.
The company variety (see Company MBA) can be criticised for failing to
provide the sort of stimulation that comes of having participants from
different organisational cultures; some standard MBAs are accused (by
employers at least) of being too general and insufficiently relevant to the
needs of employees.
The so-called consortium version is where a number of companies - often each
from a different sector and therefore non-competitors - club together to
find a programme which is structured round their needs. The business school
which awards the degree keeps an overall eye on the academic content of the
programme.
One of the pioneers of this approach was the City University Business
School. More than 20 companies are involved in CUBS' so-called management
MBA, including American Express, Lloyd's of London, IBM UK, Anglian Water
Services and Ford Motor Company.
Lancaster runs what it calls a multi-company modular programme for British
Airways, Royal Mail, BNFL, North West Water and British Gas, among others.
Henley has recently launched a European con- sortium MBA administered by its
associate in Munich. The programme's 15 participants come from three
different nationalities and five different pan-European multinationals
(Mercedes-Benz, Deutsche Aerospace, Continental, Union des Assurances de
Paris and Credit Commercial de France).
The burdens are heavy
COSTS
The MBA can involve a large financial sacrifice. The cost of a one-year,
full-time course in the UK can be well over Pounds 20,000, taking account of
living costs and lost earnings opportunities. A two-year course at a US
business school could cost a total of some Dollars 80,000.
Business school fees are continuing to rise, although the pace of increase
has slowed down recently, following several years of steep increases. Last
year, fees roughly rose in line with inflation.
vard, MIT, Stanford and Wharton, charge fees of about Dollars 20,000 a year.
European schools, which tend to take just a single year to complete, are
cheaper. However, a top school such as Insead costs FFr145,000.
Most UK business schools charge fees of around Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 8,000.
But there is a large range, from Pounds 5,000 for Heriot-Watt University to
Pounds 15,000 for Manchester Business School.
Fees for part-time MBAs are often more expensive than full-time courses, but
the financial pressures on the student are reduced by continuing to earn a
salary.
The heavy cost of taking an full-time MBA is one explanation why part-time
and distance learning programmes are becoming more popular. In 1992, more
than two-thirds of MBA students remained in employment while studying.
Some of the costs of pursuing a two-year, full-time MBA can be defrayed by
getting an internship in the summer vacations. Students are sometimes able
to combine studying with part-time work in two-year courses when the work
pressures are not too intense.
D
The way of the future
DISTANCE LEARNING
An almost exclusively British style of MBA delivery at the moment, many
experts feel distance learning is the way of the future. For others the very
idea of a correspondence course contradicts the classroom teaching and group
discussion approach, which they say is the essential heart of this
postgraduate qualification.
Students on a distance learning course study from home - usually on their
own in the evenings or at weekends - but they are often assigned a tutor
whom they can contact with problems and attend summer schools, weekend
seminars, and local support groups. Programmes typically take at least three
years - sometimes considerably more - to complete.
The Open Business School, whose teaching material is widely admired, is the
market leader in the UK and is expanding into Europe. More than 5,500
managers are studying for its MBA (including about 800 on the Continent). It
expects to be providing more than 20 per cent of all UK MBA graduates within
two years.
Henley Management College is well-established and was also early into the
field. It now has more than 5,000 students on its distance learning
programmes, either registered directly with Henley or through one of the
school's 19 associates around the world.
Warwick's 1,000th distance learning graduate will emerge next summer.
Another early pioneer, the school has over 1,500 students at various stages
of its three- or four-year programme, based in more than 70 countries.
Warwick is keen to stress its flexibility, pointing out that students can
start on a part-time MBA within travelling distance of the City and transfer
to, say, distance learning if moved to another part of the UK or overseas.
Heriot-Watt claims to have attracted more than 8,000 students over the last
three years, including students sponsored by multinationals such as IBM,
Toshiba and General Motors. The school says its course material is entirely
self-sufficient and that there is no requirement for tutor contact.
Kingston University, south of London, and Durham University in the north of
England are among other schools offering MBAs by distance learning.
It's too much for them
DROP-OUTS
Only a very small proportion of students drop out of full-time MBA
programmes in Europe and the US. The majority of these are probably caused
by ill-health: even at the best schools candidates who have passed the
admissions test are sometimes forced to leave if they fail to perform.
The casualty rate for part-time courses and distance learning - particularly
the latter - tend for fairly obvious reasons to be higher. Combining an MBA
course with a full-time job presents special challenges and the isolation
inherent in studying from home proves too much for some candidates.
E
Learning over there
EXCHANGE PROGRAMMES
As MBA courses try to become more international, some schools are offering
students the chance to spend a term overseas at schools to which they are
affiliated.
For example, Manchester Business School is affiliated to 40 schools
including Kellogg, Chicago and Berkeley. London Business School organises
exchanges with 25 business schools around the world.
The demand from students for exchanges, which typically occur in the spring
term of the second year, often exceeds the availability of places.
Students generally relish the stimulation of living abroad and studying at a
different school for several months. The potential disadvantages of
exchanges include incurring extra living expenses and spending time away
from the job search.
Rolls-Royce of the market
EXECUTIVE MBAS
Sometimes used in the UK as an alternative title for part-time programmes,
the executive MBA is normally used to denote the seniority of the 'students'
involved. This type of course is also generally regarded as the Rolls-Royce
of the MBA market, being aimed at high-flying executives whose companies pay
the fees.
Particularly popular in the US, these courses are typically held on Fridays
and Saturdays and in week-long 'bites' and field trips. Employers are often
attracted by an approach which combines work and theory in a potentially
valuable way.
The University of Chicago School of Business is using a newly launched
executive MBA programme at Barcelona to spearhead its international
expansion. The part-time programme - 10 modules of one to two weeks spread
across 18 months - is the first one a leading US business school has offered
in Europe that leads to a degree.
The bulk of the first intake - which had their first class in July - are
from European companies and almost all have at least 10 years of work
experience.
London Business School's next executive MBA course does not start until
January but a spokesman said that inquiries had doubled over the last year.
London also belives that companies such as Bankers Trust, Mercury, Blue
Circle and British Airways are using flexible options like its executive MBA
as a strategy for retaining high flying managers. 'This, of course, is only
feasible in a programme where participants do not leave their jobs'.
F
What banks will lend
FINANCE
The most popular method of financing a MBA is through savings although bank
loans also play an important part.
Many countries offer students help in financing MBAs through low-interest,
long-term loans offered to students either with government backing or
through private banks.
In the UK, Amba administers a Business School Loan Scheme on behalf of
Barclays and National Westminster banks.
For students doing a full-time course, the bank will lend a maximum of
two-thirds of last salary plus tuition fee for each year of study at a
reduced rate.
The repayment of the loan, which takes up to seven years, starts three
months after the completion of the course.
Take-up of the loan scheme is currently running well below levels at the
turn of the decade, reflecting an unwillingness on the part of borrowers to
take on debt and an unwillingness on the part of bank managers to lend to
MBA students without collateral.
Students on a one-year course who are not accepted for an Amba loan may be
able to apply for a Career Development Loan.
Repayment of the loans, which are organised by the Department of Employment
with Barclays, the Clydesdale Bank and the Co-operative Bank, begins three
months after the study period is completed.
Some students get financial support from employers, particularly those doing
part-time MBAs or distance learning MBAs. Amba estimates that 60-70 per cent
of finance for these courses comes from employers.
Although some employers do contribute to fees of full-time MBAs, they are
generally deterred by the likelihood that students will want to change jobs
at the end of their course.
Full-time gets shorter
FULL-TIME MBAS
The classic model for the MBA, developed in the US, is the two-year
full-time programme. While this is still the norm in North America, one year
is now much more typical in Europe.
Only London Business School in the UK, for example, now offers a two-year
course with IESE in Barcelona a rare continental example. Manchester (which
now promotes its programme as a 12-month minimum, 19-month maximum, or
15-month 'standard') and Erasmus-Rotterdam in the Netherlands have both
reduced the length of their full-time courses in response to what they say
is market demand.
Instituto de Empresa in Madrid runs a 16-month programme including four
months' paid internship in a national or multinational company.
Job insecurity and the high opportunity cost obviously have much to do with
the latest trend, but London is sticking to its guns. The school believes
that one of the problems with a one-year MBA programme is that students are
forced to start looking for a job almost from the moment they start their
course. More importantly, though, it argues that two years allows time for
more in-depth study, notably through more project work with companies.
Most one- and two-year programmes split into a set of compulsory core
courses (eg finance, marketing, operations management, followed by elective
courses (see Optional Courses). Most will include a mandatory in-company
project.
G
Not quite a welcome mat
GMAT
Pronounced Gee-mat, these letters stand for the Graduate Management
Admissions Test, a requirement for most business schools round the world.
Some institutions (notably Harvard) have devised tests of their own, but in
many cases these cover similar areas of numeracy, literacy and verbal and
numerical reasoning as the GMAT.
A GMAT score, or its equivalent, is normally the starting point of any
application for an MBA though a good result is not a guarantee to entry. Top
schools usually demand minimum score levels of at least 550-600 (out of a
maximum, though rarely achieved, 800). MIT topped a table of US schools
compiled recently by the Economist Intelligence Unit with an average score
of 680 per student, while Insead headed the European list with an average of
650.
Despite its attraction as an international benchmark, the GMAT is a
controversial admissions tool. A growing number of schools refuse to quote
their average score on the grounds that it is misleading, while some
academics say that, being only available in English, it is culturally
biased. Many schools allow for this when assessing non-white Americans.
Because of these and other worries, the GMAT has recently been revised. From
this month, candidates will for the first time face two half-hour essay
questions designed to test ability to analyse complex issues and argue a
position, as well as the traditional multiple choice questions divided into
several sections.
The test is given four times a year in January, March, June and October in
numerous centres round the world. A registration form and the GMAT Bulletin
of Information, which lists test centres and dates of tests, as well as
giving sample questions, can be obtained from the Educational Testing
Service, PO Box 6108, Princeton, New Jersey, 08541, US. In the UK there are
a number of independent MBA and GMAT training and preparation centres.
US and other influences
GRANDES ECOLES
The grandes ecoles, which like so much in France can be traced back to
Napoleon, are independent of the French universities, but closely associated
with and partly financed by local chambers of commerce through a compulsory
payroll tax on employers.
Originally set up to prepare children of wealthy industrialists and
merchants for a career in the family business, they evolved after the second
world war into much more professional and better focused management training
institutions, influenced greatly by what was going on in the US.
Today, there are 21 grandes ecoles of management which turn out some 8,000
graduates a year. Students typically follow a five-year general management
curriculum which starts immediately after the baccalaureat and which is
sub-divided into two years of classes preparatoires devoted to pre-business
school courses, a one-year foundation course and the two-year graduate
programme proper.
The qualification they receive is generally known in France as the masters
in management, and is quite distinct from the MBA. However, Paris-based HEC
(through its specialist arm the Institut Superieur des Affaires) and Groupe
ESC Lyon are among those which also run MBA courses.

Positive contamination
HEALTH SERVICE MBAS
The changing state of the health service wrought by the government's health
reforms has, not unsurprisingly, stimulated more interest in management
development in the profession.
Health Service MBAs are taught at the university business schools of
Canterbury, Durham and Nottingham with health management electives tending
to form half of the MBA.
Most interest in health service MBAs is in part-time study undertaken over
two years.
The two-year Northern Health Service MBA at Durham is nearly two years old,
having started in January 1993. Average work experience prior to MBA study
is much higher than at most business schools - approximately 15 years with
the average age of candidates standing at 37.
The depth of work experience is a considerable advantage in boosting
academic achievement, says Mr David Stoker, MBA director at the university.
'There is a lot of positive contamination with the students learning from
each other as well as from the course.'
Typically, health electives in an MBA include such subjects as Health
Information Systems; Comparative Health Care Systems and Health Across
Europe.
Duke University's Fuqua School of Business claims, as part of its weekend
executive MBA programme, to be offering the first US programme designed
specifically to meet the needs of health care industry managers.
I
No need for nuts and bolts
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
The Information Technology MBA aims to teach effective management via the
use of IT and to make information systems play a role in corporate strategy.
The course runs at the business schools of City University in London and
Hull University.
Henley also offers the IT Hybrid Manager MBA which is built around the
consortium approach and facilitates the interaction between managers from
the IT function and from elsewhere in the organisation.
The abilities that it aims to teach are competence in the selection,
introduction and development of information systems to a level that will
make IT an effective tool of corporate strategy.
The IT MBA caters for both types of candidate - those au fait with the nuts
and bolts of technology and those who are not. Ms Anne Leeming, director of
the IT MBA at City University Business School, where IT comprises half of
the course, stresses that a technical aptitude is not essential.
'It is not a technical course. It is focused on management using IT.'
Therefore, the constant developments in IT do not invalidate a specialist
MBA in the subject. Ms Leeming says that the course has hardly altered since
it began in 1989.
The fish in the pool
INTERNATIONALISM
This is one of today's big business school buzzwords, but there is still
debate about what constitutes a truly international approach. When judging
whether a school is really international, attention should be paid to
student mix, faculty mix, cross-border links (see Exchange Programmes) and
course content.
Schools like IMD, London, Insead and Manchester typically attract a high
proportion of international students and faculty. Manchester's full time
class is roughly 25 per cent UK, 15 per cent other European Union, and 60
per cent rest of the world. IMD pays attention to the size of what it calls
'the Anglo pool' - the proportion of students from countries where English
is the mother tongue. Mr Kamran Kashani, the MBA programme director, says
that the 'pool' accounts for about 40 per cent of applications but that as a
deliberate strategy IMD makes sure that only 25 per cent of its 83-strong
class 'is in that cluster'.
Insead's fresh intake last month was 65 per cent western European (of which
a surprisingly high 9 per cent are German), 17 per cent from the Nafta
countries, and 6 per cent eastern European. The 235 students represent 33
different nationalities.
London Business School, meanwhile, has an MBA class that is 75 per cent
'overseas', much the same as last year.
Many feel the key issue is the programme content, though how this is
achieved varies widely from school to school. Some add specific
international options, others have tried to introduce an international
dimension to the whole course.
Some European schools have developed programmes whereby students can spend
terms at up to three different schools and still take the same degree. The
link between Cranfield and Groupe SC Lyon in France is noteworthy in this
context.
J
Positions vanish
JOBS
In recent years, many newly-qualified MBAs have found it a challenge to find
a suitable job.
Companies' cost-cutting and restructuring exercises have removed many of the
management positions that MBA graduates aspire to. The management
consultancies and financial services companies which traditionally recruited
large numbers of MBAs scaled back in the downturn. Even highly qualified
candidates from top business schools have suffered lengthy periods of
unemployment.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been some improvement in
recruitment levels. As well as some pick-up in interest from financial
services companies and consultancies, there are signs of increased interest
from non-traditional recruiters, including the manufacturing sector.
However, finding a job requires more effort than it did in the last decade.
At a time when companies are laying off large numbers of employees, some are
reluctant to be seen to be actively recruiting MBA students. Although jobs
are available, it has become more important to seek them through alternative
routes, such as networking.
One consequence of the difficult job market is that it has blighted many MBA
students' ambitions to change career. When employers are able to choose
between numerous applicants, they tend to opt for experience.
But even when MBA graduates remain in the same career, they are often able
to move up the managerial scale. This may be accompanied by a move to a
smaller organisation. A survey of alumni conducted by Amba in 1992 found
that, before their MBA, 43 per cent were employed in large organisations and
20 per cent in smaller organisations; after the MBA those proportions were
reversed.
The same survey found that around 30 per cent of MBA graduates worked in
consultancy and finance. Some 27 per cent of MBAs were in general
management, 19 per cent in sales and marketing, 11 per cent in corporate
strategy and planning and another 11 per cent in finance and control.
For those employed while studying for a MBA, 56 per cent remained with their
existing employer for at least a year after graduating. Of those not
employed while studying for their MBA, 40 per cent did not start a job
immediately after the course's completion. On average, it took these
students 5.5 months to get a job.
The real difficulty facing those contemplating a MBA, particularly a
two-year MBA, is that job prospects are hard to calculate at the time they
embark on the course. Anyone leaving an existing job to do a MBA is taking a
gamble on the state of the job market on graduation.
An MBA with garnish
JOINT DISCIPLINE MBAS
The latest edition of Which MBA (see Guides) notes that some American
schools are offering opportunities to combine an MBA with another
postgraduate degree such as law. These joint degrees, it notes, 'are
becoming increasingly popular among both recruiters and students'.
In the UK, meanwhile, there is a tendency to specialism in some schools.
City University, for example, offers five one-year full-time programmes
which combine a general management 'core' with one of five specialisms
(finance, human resources, information technology, international
business/export and marketing). Other schools have resisted this approach
and argue that a particular emphasis can be achieved in the choice of
electives or optional courses.

Sir John Egan (BAA, formerly of Jaguar), Sir Christopher Hogg (Courtaulds

of an MBA. Sir Graham Day (formerly British Shipbuilders, Rover and
PowerGen) and Sir John Harvey-Jones (former chairman of ICI) did not.
No business school deans are thought to have been awarded knighthoods.
L
Just talk in English
LANGUAGES
Most schools will demand some proof of fluency from non-native speakers
applying for an English-based programme (which the vast majority are).
While English alone is sufficient for virtually all UK schools - London
Business School which requires proficiency in another language is a notable
exception - an increasing number of British schools such as Manchester and
Dorset stress their language learning facilities. Some continental European
schools run courses which are wholly in English, but most in, say, France
and Spain require that at least some classes are also taken in the 'home'
tongue.
M
Benchmark setters
MANAGEMENT CHARTER INITIATIVE
The Management Charter Initiative (MCI) began in 1988, the creation of Sir
Bob Reid and a number of groups including the British Institute of
Management and the Confederation of British Industry.
It does not provide professional training but rather tries to foster an
interest in training and relevant qualifications among managers and
employers. MCI studies the level of training and qualifications prevalent
among managerial levels and makes recommendations for standard setting.
Its most recent work was draft standards for senior management, after having
set benchmarks for best practice for middle managers, first-line managers
and supervisors. Last month these finished trials in a variety of
organisations.
MCI's research among thousands of managers helps shape higher level national
vocational qualifications. Standards are formed from its research and passed
onto the National Council for Vocational Qualifications which sets NVQs. The
role of MCI is largely opinion-forming and quality setting rather than that
of dictating specific goals. Which NVQs managers take is entirely up to them
and their bosses. The nuts and bolts of qualification attainment are seen as
the employer's responsibility.
There is no direct link with business schools which generally tend to be
more academically oriented, concentrating largely on the MBA. Mr Andrew
Summers, MCI chief executive, says: 'We would like to see MBAs developing to
be more focused on competence as well as knowledge.'
He sees the MBA as essentially a preparatory qualification after which it is
important to demonstrate competence, something for which NVQs are designed.
Several business schools do award NVQs and the MCI does some work with
these.
MCI is non profit-making, funded by private and public sector subscriptions,
which aims to develop management skills and generally improve managerial
quality. It is backed by about 1,600 companies and the government and its
members cut right across the sectoral board; from private through public to
voluntary.
While being a national forum, the thrust of its operation is via a series of
local networks which promote activities and information among employers. The
networks often link with other interested parties in a region such as
Training and Enterprise Councils and Chambers of Commerce.
Block release for the boss
MODULAR MBAS
This is a term which can best be translated as the management equivalent of
a block release course.
Warwick Business School launched such a course in January this year which
involves participants being absent from work for 13 intensive one-week
'modules' which are spread over about three years.
One of the most established modular MBAs - designed especially for
experienced managers - is run by Ashridge Management College in
Hertfordshire.
The emphasis of the programme is on developing leadership behaviour and on
helping candidates to acquire the skills that are needed to manage, across
international and cultural boundaries.
Henley Management College in Oxfordshire was also early into the field.
Meanwhile, the Judge Institute of Management Studies at the University of
Cambridge has introduced an innovative modular structure.
This involves extended periods of full-time study which are sandwiched
between substantial work experience (for either one or two 12-month periods
depending on the option chosen), where what is learnt in class can be put
into practice.

Old boys on the way up
NETWORKING
In other words, this is what you know and whom you know. Networking can be
all-important for maximising the potential of a business education.
Networking means anything from genteel inquiries in a wine bar to exchanges
of CVs and job opportunities via a graduate association.
By its very nature, networking is not an organised activity although more
structures are growing and many organisations are springing up that are more
akin to a recruitment agency than the traditional word-of-mouth image of
networking.
Business schools are a useful marketplace and the largest and best-known
centre for business alumni is the Association of MBAs (Amba).
Amba membership now stands at around 8,000, as it has grown rapidly in the
past few years.
Cranfield School of Management is another important source of networks. It
is home to the Management Development Advisory Service.
Individual schools tend to be a good avenue for networking, whether they
offer a definite association or not. Schools obviously have links with
business and are often approached by companies for recommendations. Alumni
associations, however, are also targeted by schools in their fund-raising
activities.
Following the recession, networking organisations have also flourished to
serve particular specialities in business and industry.
Networking is frequently used to secure work on occasional projects as well
as permanent jobs. This pertains especially to technological related work.
Practice in lieu of theory
NVQs
National Vocational Qualifications are designed to test skills and
competence in the workplace and operate in more than 80 per cent of
occupations.
They emphasise practical skills within a job and seek a demonstration of
understanding of that job's requirements rather than theoretical
examinations.
Therefore, it is difficult to equate them directly with traditional academic
standards. But very roughly an NVQ level 1 is approximately similar to 4
GCSEs, grade D to G; NVQ 2 ranks alongside 5 GCSEs, grade A to C and NVQ 3
can be compared with 2 A levels. NVQs level 4 and 5 are harder to gauge as
they are geared towards management competence and require demonstration of a
fair amount of personal autonomy. They can be approximated with education
achieved at higher levels, not necessarily degree standards but beyond A
level.
Much of the standards set for NVQs level 4 and 5 come from management
standards laid down by the Management Charter Initiative.
The quality of NVQs, which are tested in the workplace and operate on a
fairly flexible basis with requirements varying among different occupations,
is monitored by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications. The
council, which is responsible to the government, approves and accredits the
qualification.
Accreditation lasts for five years, after which it must be renewed.
NVQs, particularly the lower levels, have been subject to some criticism
with the suspicion in academic and industrial circles that they cannot be a
substitute for traditional methods of testing knowledge.
The advantages and disadvantages of NVQs versus a more traditional
qualification such as the MBA boil down to relevance. Managers may want more
practical expertise in addition to straightforward academic knowledge or in
some circumstances they may need people-based abilities and utilitarian
aptitude in preference to theoretical achievement.

Amba and acronyms
ORGANISATIONS
The Association of MBAs (15 Duncan Terrace, London N1 8BZ, Tel:
071-837-3375). Founded in 1967 by a group of British graduates recently
returned from leading US business schools, Amba's original aims were to
promote management education in the UK and to develop an information and
social network for business school alumni.
Today Amba also performs a quality controlling role for UK and continental
institutions (see Accreditation), runs an annual reception for business
schools and potential recruits, and publishes a Guide to Business Schools
(see Guides).
The Association of Business Schools (344-354 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1X
8BP, tel: 071-837-1899). With 100 business school members, the ABS is in
effect the trade association for the UK management education industry. Its
aims include promotion and government lobbying, but its most visible
contribution is a Directory of members and the courses they offer (see
Guides).
The European Foundation for Management Development (40 Rue Washington,
B-1050, Brussels, tel: 322 648-0385). EFMD - a European forum for
information, research and best practice in management development - has in
the past discussed the idea of common European standards for accreditation.
The consensus now is that Europe is not a single model and that national
norms and mutual recognition are the way ahead.
P
How most people do it
PART-TIME MBAS
Most business schools run part-time MBA courses; indeed most MBA degrees in
the US, the UK (Europe's largest market) and Asia are now awarded to
part-time students. Part-time MBAs fall into a number of sub-categories,
some of which (Executive MBAs, Distance Learning and Modular MBAs) are
discussed elsewhere.
The most common part-time MBA courses - from City University in London to
Esade in Barcelona - are taught after working hours a couple of evenings per
week and/or at weekends, with occasional residential periods thrown in for
more in-depth study. 'Students' on part-time programmes are often older and
more experienced than their full-time counterparts. Many managers, though,
find it hard to set aside time to study at the same time as holding down a
challenging job - hence the appeal of the modular approach.
A hands-on alternative
PROJECT APPROACH
In their third term, MBA students often become mini-consultants, dealing
with a company's marketing challenges, expansion opportunities, management
dilemmas. Alternatively, part-time students may undertake a specific task
for their company which will be appraised as part of their MBA.
This is the project approach which forms the practical application of MBAs
at almost all business schools. The project approach, which deals with real
situations, has prospered in UK business schools.
It contrasts with the case study approach, championed especially by Harvard
business school. Case study methods tend to require a response to
theoretical situations; project approaches are the hands-on alternative.
Both are meant to test the student's ability to synthesise the various
aspects of the course. They will need to exercise ability in most of the
core subjects covered; determine the relevance of each one in the given
situation and act accordingly.
Business schools often invite smaller companies to take up consultancy
services from students undertaking their third term project. For the company
it can prove a very cost-effective method of receiving such services from
people who are not that far from going into such roles on a permanent basis.
Cranfield School of Management is unusual in not making the project an
obligatory part of the MBA. A full-term project can be undertaken but the
school finds that students prefer to take more electives. Cranfield is the
only business school to offer an academic year of four teaching terms and
according to Mr Colin Gordon, director of the full-time MBA, students are
drawn to the centre because they can maximise their theoretical learning.
'Many have a number of years' experience in work and feel that they benefit
more from the various electives. They do some project work that lasts three
to four weeks and often feel that this is enough.' The proportion of
students who do choose to take the full-term project option is very small.
To manage the state
PUBLIC SECTOR MBAS
Aston, Henley, Birmingham and Exeter in the UK offer MBA programmes in
public sector management.
Several others (eg Bradford, South Bank and Strathclyde) lay on specialist
modules in this area. Cranfield runs a course for the Ministry of Defence
which combines the general core of its full-time MBA with a number of
specialist electives.
Q
Emphasis on experience
QUALIFICATIONS
The qualifications required for MBA students have changed over the past few
years. More emphasis is placed on experience of work than was the case a few
years ago when it was a reasonable rule of thumb among business schools that
an MBA was usually bolted straight on to a first degree.
The average age for candidates beginning a full-time MBA is 28; for those on
a part-time course it is 30-32 and for those distance learning it is
considerably more.
Qualification requirements tend to be a first degree and about three years'
experience in work. In exceptional cases candidates with work experience but
no degree are accepted by business schools although they only make up about
2-3 per cent of MBA candidates.
And Mr Roger McCormick, director-general of the Association of MBAs, issues
a general note of caution against business schools willing to accept
candidates without work experience. 'In spite of their ability, those
without relevant experience will probably find that their peers are critical
of them,' he says.
A GMAT is not a necessity for all business schools. If a candidate does
elect to take the GMAT in preparation for an MBA then it is worth
remembering that a business school will expect a good result, or a good
reason why a high figure has not been attained.
The MBA is a multidisciplinary generalist degree that should not require
specialist knowledge to study for. However, in practice the modern MBA
programme is heavily quantitative: anyone with limited skills in mathematics
will struggle.
As for the value of an MBA once that qualification is obtained, Mr McCormick
believes it is a solid foundation which will facilitate advances later. 'An
MBA is generalist which has its use in the long term. It is not intended to
provide an immediate springboard but to prepare someone for a role in senior
management later on.'
MBAs are not graded. A candidate achieves a pass or a fail; there are no
classes as with a first degree.
It is difficult to rank MBAs and Mr McCormick flinches at the thought,
although of course business schools have varying reputations and that may
have a bearing on employers' considerations.
Specialist MBAs are just that, an industry or sector-tailored qualification.
They are not considered of greater value than a traditional MBA. In fact, Mr
McCormick warns of the danger of MBAs which are too hybrid, as opposed to a
core MBA with speciality components tacked on.
'There is a bit of a trend to tart up specialist MScs as MBAs,' he says.
R
OK for those at the top
Rankings
Published rankings have been common in the US for some years - the Business
Week survey is the most widely quoted and probably the most reputable - but
European business schools have traditionally shied away from league tables.
That said, there is a strong view that proper rankings would make a
contribution to a more efficient and well-informed market place if the right
methodology could be found.
Most of the attempts so far are superficial, either because they concentrate
only on one aspect of a business school portfolio (eg research reputation,
MBAs, executive programmes) or because the method of assessment is flawed.
Even schools which publicly 'knock' the idea of rankings will use them in
their promotional material if they are shown in a good light.
S
Rewards diminish
SALARIES
The years when MBAs could be sure of a large rise in salary as a result of
gaining their qualification have gone. The premium attracted by the
qualification has declined, perhaps reflecting both recession and a changing
balance in the supply and demand of MBAs. Some students have even
experienced unemployment and pay cuts as a result of taking the MBA.
One of the difficulties facing MBA graduates is that management consulting
and the financial services industry, which was traditionally considered a
route to a top salary, cut back sharply on recruitment in recent years. Many
graduates have turned to small and medium-sized companies, where salaries
are generally lower than those than in large organisations.
The financial case for the qualification has lessened over the past decade.
In the first half of the 1980s, students could expect an average increase in
salary of 40 per cent as a result of taking a MBA, according to an Amba
survey. By 1991, the figure had fallen to 16.5 per cent.
A later survey, in June 1992, showed that 30 per cent of MBAs earned between
Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 40,000 a year. Seven per cent reported salaries of
less than Pounds 20,000 and, at the other end of the scale, 8 per cent had
salaries over Pounds 70,000 and 3 per cent earned more than Pounds 100,000.
The majority of MBAs were eligible for pension, a company car, private
medical insurance and a performance-related bonus.
Apply early if in need
SCHOLARSHIPS BURSARIES SPONSORSHIP
A limited number of scholarships and bursaries is offered by business
schools. These are usually targeted at people with special merit or need. It
is important to apply early for awards, which are often listed in the
school's brochure.
Some students are sponsored by their employers to do a MBA. But it may be
difficult to persuade an employee to pay the fees for a full-time course,
not least because most students contemplate a career change at the end of
the course. Sponsorship is generally limited to part-time, distance learning
and company programmes in which the student remains in employment.
A comprehensive list of grants, scholarships and awards is available in the
Grants Register, published by Macmillan Publishers of Basingstoke, which is
available in most large libraries.
Institutions which offer relevant scholarships include the Association of
Commonwealth Universities, the London Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, Rotary
International, Royal Academy of Engineering, the American Association of
University Women, British University North America Club and the English
Speaking Union of the Commonwealth.
Some awards are specifically directed towards minorities or women. Thus,
Cosmopolitan magazine offers a bursary for studying at Insead.

SOCIAL LIFE
Pressure of work can militate against an active social life for MBA
students; indeed for all but the most gifted it may be a contradiction in
terms. However, student clubs, student government and community activities
are all possible outlets for surplus energy and provide an opportunity to
test newly acquired leadership and negotiation skills.
Most schools will help organise sports, such as tennis, while parties with a
country theme are a favourite of classes with a wide international student
spread.

Courses may qualify
TAX RELIEF
The principle of tax relief for MBA courses appears to have been conceded in
the UK - but its application still remains unclear. The concession -
extending relief for individuals paying their own vocational training bills
to graduate and postgraduate courses consistent with level five of the
National Vocational Qualifications system - became effective in April.
The issue is obviously an important one for business schools at a time of
flagging demand for full-time MBA courses. It was also highlighted by an
All-Party House of Commons Trade and Industry Committee report which
expressed the view that it was 'unfair and damaging that individuals paying
for training are treated less favourably for tax purposes than companies
doing so'.
An Inland Revenue spokesman told the FT earlier this month: 'It is up to the
training organisation to say whether it (the MBA) could lead to an NVQ.'
Asked whether claiming relief was worth a try, he replied: 'Yes'.
U
Influx to act as stimulus
UNDERGRADUATE COURSES
There is more to business schools than MBA courses.
Government statistics show that business studies is the fastest-growing
undergraduate degree course. Youngsters, many with vocational business
qualifications, are keen to take courses in management and business rather
than economics, where numbers are dropping.
Courses at undergraduate level are still far less popular than MBAs. Last
year business studies accounted for 17 per cent of all higher degrees
awarded at 'old' universities - excluding those upgraded from polytechnics
in the last two years - but only 4 per cent of first degrees, according to
the Universities Statistical Record.
But the number of business studies undergraduates rose by 9.9 per cent last
year, to 17,200, while most 'new' universities are offering business
degrees, often in combination with other subjects.
Universities hope that the influx of undergraduates will act as a stimulus
to improve the teaching of business. However, a business studies degree is
unlikely ever to be regarded as a stepping stone for an MBA. Instead,
business degrees, particularly from new universities, are intended to
provide well-qualified middle managers.
Business schools are also diversifying into providing shorter courses for
middle managers later in their careers, often helped by government funding
for training. For example, Warwick University's Centre for Small and Medium
Sized Enterprises operates the 'Host Initiative'. This takes redundant
senior executives from large companies in the area, such as Rolls-Royce and
Rover, gives them a training course for a few months to update them on
management theory, and then sends them to placements with small companies.
The scheme recently found permanent employment for its 100th executive. This
benefits the local economy as smaller companies attempt to fill the gap left
by the contracting car builders, and the government will encourage similar
schemes elsewhere.

A type of finance which has been of keen interest to MBAs and other business
school graduates (though latterly the recession may have dented their
enthusiasm). Surveys show that more than 90 per cent of MBA applicants cite
career change as a motivation for going to business school and that 5 per
cent end up being self-employed after their studies.
Entrepreneurship has been a notably popular optional course (or elective) in
recent years.

Childbearing disadvantage
WOMEN
Many business schools are concerned about the low percentage of women they
attract, which is generally less than 25 per cent.
There are some exceptions. The schools which recruit the highest percentage
of women students are Ashridge at 50 per cent, Monaco at 47 per cent and
Toronto at 46 per cent, according to the Which MBA? guide.
Before 1976, women were virtually unrepresented among MBA graduates,
according to Amba. Over the next 13 years, the proportion of women taking
MBAs grew steadily until it reached about 20 per cent; since 1989, it has
plateaued.
Explanations for the low proportion of women vary. Some schools believe it
is in line, or even above, the number of women expecting to reach senior
management positions. 'While women still represent a minority of MBAs, the
proportion is relatively large compared with the overall management
positions occupied by women,' says Amba.
Another explanation is that women in their late 20s - a common age to take a
MBA - are often considering a break in their career to start a family. Some
schools are trying to promote the idea that women who take career breaks to
bring up a family might find an MBA a way back into the job market.
Forty per cent of women managers who responded to a survey conducted by City
University Business School felt that schools could do more to promote the
benefits of an MBA to employers.
The authors agreed that schools need to reassure women that an MBA adds
value to their careers, and that the difficulties of attendance facing many
women at the traditional age of 29-32 should be acknowledged. 'Promoting an
MBA as something a woman may consider during a career break or moving
towards a modular system whereby an MBA can be taken over a longer period
are strong options for the future', they concluded.

Titles of no degree
X-RATED BUSINESS SCHOOLS
Students or prospective students should be very wary of institutions
offering MBAs in the UK which are not validated by a university.
Regular MBA employers have a good idea which programmes are respectable  -
they will certainly shun the 'degree mills' around the world which award
MBAs on payment of fees but which require limited, if any, academic input
from the candidate.
Although an American business school may well be accredited at home by the
American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, approval by that body
of its affiliates outside the US does not necessarily follow.
In France, intending applicants could check for membership of the Chapitre
des Grandes Ecoles though Insead, one of the best-known international
schools, is outside the university system.
On the whole, the more stringent and demanding the entry requirements of a
business school, the higher up the quality ladder a programme is likely to
be.
Y
Passport may be invalid
YUPPIE DEGREE
In the second half of the 1980s the MBA attracted the nickname (mainly in
the US) of 'yuppie degree'. For many, it seemed an automatic passport to red
braces, high salaries and fast cars. That image, however, has had to be
revised in an era of more sober expectation, greater management complexity
and softer leadership styles.

ZARF
According to Collins' English dictionary the Zarf is a Middle Eastern
holder, usually ornamental, for a hot coffee cup. It is an essential piece
of 'kit' for the ambitious MBA student.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of Business Schools - An A-Z Guide (1): An image that
is blurred by diversity - Though there are signs of a pick-up in demand for
MBA courses and executive programmes, management institutions in the US and
Europe are still hesistant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Logically speaking, business schools should thrive in a period of
uncertainty and rapid change. The knowledge, ideas and high octane
brainpower with which the best ones are blessed, after all, are potentially
priceless assets for companies seeking a competitive edge.
Yet for all the campus insights into derivatives trading, global markets and
how to harness information technology - not to mention 'softer' issues such
as leadership and teamwork - management education institutions in the US and
Europe are in a hesitant mood. There are tentative signs, to be sure, that
demand for executive programmes has picked up and that more young managers
may again be prepared to invest in their own futures by embarking on a full-
or part-time Masters of Business Administration (MBA) degree. But amid the
fragile hopes for an early recovery, anxieties remain.
Have business schools yet done enough to dispel their old image of
inward-looking institutions semi-detached from the real world?
If so, how do they retain the best academic values of the universities from
which many were spawned while addressing the pressing short-term needs of
their commercial customers? Is co-operation with competitors the only way to
achieve critical mass internationally? And like the companies they advise,
how do they hang on to, and manage, their own top talent?
At least schools appear to be shaking off one persistent shadow, namely the
never-very-convincing argument that formal management education is a waste
of time, that there is no substitute for seat-of-the-pants learning.
Few would quibble with the second part of that statement - hence the rethink
of MBA courses to include more project work and the growth of short 'company
specific' training programmes - but the ever-growing complexity of general
management these days and the speed with which new ideas and information
flow across national boundaries have also reinforced the value for
executives of stepping outside their own immediate working environment from
time to time.
That message, however, now has to be powerfully sold by business schools in
a way which was almost unnecessary in the more free-spending 1980s: the
marketing of courses of all kinds is an increasingly sophisticated,
time-consuming and expensive activity.
The extra effort is partly the legacy of a recession which slashed corporate
training budgets, reduced through 'delayering' the pool of middle managers
who traditionally fill most seats in classrooms, and left those remaining in
work so preoccupied with the task of self survival that 'time-outs' at
business school became impractical.
The job market, moreover, became markedly more difficult for graduating MBAs
 -and salary premiums less juicy - requiring schools to invest much more
energy in helping students with their careers.
Even if there is anecdotal evidence of recessionary pressures starting to
ease, the direction, scale and sustainability of demand remains far from
clear. While top European and US schools are reporting more interest in
executive programmes, the extent to which this has affected so-called
company specific programmes as opposed to open ones (where participants come
together from different organisations) seemingly varies from institution to
institution.
The MBA outlook is equally patchy. Professor George Bain, principal of
London Business School, concedes that there has been an important shift in
the market from full-time programmes to part-time courses which can be
combined with a full-time job. LBS reduced the size of its recent full-time
intake - 'to preserve the quality of participants' - but Prof Bain says the
school is experiencing 'buoyant' demand for its (part-time) executive MBA.
Prof Leo Murray, director of Cranfield School of Management, says demand for
his full-time programme has recently been 'much better' - but he agrees that
the market as a whole has continued to grow in the UK only because of the
various part-time delivery mechanisms, notably distance learning.
To a large extent, such diversity should be welcomed: it makes management
education accessible to a far wider range of participants, not least
managers in the public sector (or former public sector) who are much better
represented on courses offered by the new universities or former
polytechnics than they are in the more established business schools.
On the other hand, the bewildering range of MBA suppliers today - the number
of business schools increased fivefold in the UK in the 1980s - has altered
the image of what was once a relatively uniform and internationally
tradeable passport to business success.
The market is no doubt the most reliable judge of quality and the American
system of independent business school accreditation sometimes cited as a
model far from ideal; nevertheless calls for tougher standards and better
consumer protection are unlikely to fade away. 'It would be nice to be able
to distinguish the real thing, like champagne,' says Mr Ludo Van der Heyden,
co-dean of Insead.
One issue which schools can no longer duck is the changing nature of their
relationship with companies. As with all businesses, the customer is getting
closer. To some extent this is a funding issue - Insead last year went out
to corporate sponsors to build up an endowment of permanent capital - but it
is also what big companies increasingly expect.
'In the past businesses looking for a company specific programme wanted just
that - a programme,' explains one dean. 'Now it is a mix of learning,
consulting and research. The course we run would be a catalyst for change
throughout the whole organisation and would typically be preceded by a lot
of consultancy.'
Mr Mike Osbaldeston, chief executive of Ashridge in the UK, says that
consultants and management educationalists now often work together. 'The
dividing line is becoming increasingly blurred,' he suggests. 'Whether you
are developing individual managers or organisations doesn't matter -
companies themselves are trying to do both'.
Mr Osbaldeston believes that business schools on the whole have thrown off
their 'remote, academic and insufficiently practical' image, though he says
the picture lingers on in some sections of the press.
Nevertheless, formidable challenges remain as schools try to make sense of
today's corporate quicksands, as much for themselves as for their clients.
The need to be more international - in terms of students, faculty and course
content - is one clear imperative but achieving the right balance has not
been easy for institutions with mostly strong domestic roots. Hence the
popularity of exchange programmes and alliances, a trend which is likely to
lead to closer cross-border co-operation between schools.
Business school curriculums, meanwhile, require more than just an
international flavour. Much soul-searching has already been devoted to
translating the old vertical approach (marketing, finance, economics, etc)
into a more integrated, cross-functional teaching style (better reflecting
real world problems). The experimentation phase has yet some way to go.
The remaining contents of this survey - which concentrates largely on the
MBA rather than company programmes as such - are an attempt to spell out
some of these issues for would-be participants and recruiters alike.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Molyneaux backs further peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BELFAST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, has endorsed
the prospect of negotiations between Sinn Fein and the British government.
Amid clear indications that London will drop its insistence that an IRA
ceasefire should be declared 'permanent', Mr Molyneaux said yesterday that
negotiations between the British government and Irish nationalists would be
a 'very, very important development'.
The move came as the Irish government prepared in the light of the IRA and
loyalist ceasefires to end a state of emergency that has existed in the
republic since 1939.
The UUP leader, speaking for the first time since the declaration last week
of the loyalist ceasefire, said he did not see the word 'permanent' as an
essential obstacle.
Instead he told the BBC that the start of negotiations 'will mean that Her
Majesty's government will be represented by intermediate-rank civil servants
with a mix of intelligence officers to verify, to obtain from the IRA
assurances . . . that their command structure has been disbanded'.
His comments come amid strong expectations that Mr John Major will announce
his government's readiness to initiate talks on the constitutional future of
Northern Ireland in the next two weeks.
A decision on such talks could be taken by the cabinet's Northern Ireland
committee later this week. There is speculation that the government will
make its intentions clear before a Commons debate on Ulster expected on
October 26.
Mr Molyneaux made clear yesterday that he did not expect the UUP to hold
talks with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader.
Asked whether he would shake Mr Adams' hand, he replied: 'I don't quite see
that happening for a long time because I don't see that we're going to be in
the same company.' The remarks implied that Mr Molyneaux would like to see
the peace process restricted to bilateral London-Sinn Fein talks.
Speaking to the UUP conference at Carrickfergus on Saturday Mr Molyneaux
also restated his party's misgivings about the peace process.
He attacked as 'unworkable' the principle that nothing is agreed until
everything is agreed.
The republic's move to scrap the state of emergency, introduced in the
second world war to deal with IRA activities, was described yesterday by Mr
Dick Spring, the Irish deputy premier, as 'a powerful and symbolic way of
saying that the national emergency is ended, and that a national nightmare
is over'.
Mr Spring told a meeting in Cork he would table proposals to revoke the 1976
Emergency Powers Act, introduced following the IRA murder in Dublin of
British ambassador Christopher Ewart-Biggs and reinforcing earlier emergency
powers, which allows the detention of terrorist suspects for a week without
being charged.
In the wake of the loyalist ceasefire Mr Martin MacGuinness of Sinn Fein
raised the prospect of an early meeting with Mr David Ervine, representative
of the loyalist paramilitaries.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Lamont resigns from Bow Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor who sparked a row at the Tory
conference, has quit the Bow Group after 30 years' membership.
He is believed to have quit the Tory think-tank because he was angry about
its refusal to stage his speech at the party conference fringe last week in
which he suggested Britain could leave the European Union. He eventually
made the speech at a fringe meeting organised by the rightwing Selsdon
Group.
The Bow Group said: 'We didn't want to give him a platform because we gave
him one at last year's conference and he delivered his alternative budget.
We're a broad-church organisation . . . and we didn't want to be seen to be
giving Norman Lamont a platform every time he asked for it.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Plea on 'windfall' power profits
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas and the regional electricity companies should hand over their
'windfall profits' to the Energy Savings Trust or to local energy charities,
Labour says today.
Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary, said the companies had
received more than Pounds 1bn from customers pre-paying bills in order to
avoid paying value added tax on on domestic fuel.
Two companies - Midlands Electricity and ScottishPower - had agreed to pass
on money to energy charities, said Mr Smith. He added: 'The interest which
companies are earning on the pre-paid money will amount to over Pounds 15m.
This is enough to insulate more than 20,000 homes and begin to mitigate the
worst impacts of VAT on fuel for these households.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Outside directors 'more productive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The productivity of non-executive directors has increased by half in the
past three years, according to research by 3i, the investment company.
In a study conducted with the Top Pay Research Group, a specialist on
executives' earnings, 3i said non-executives were increasingly putting more
time into helping companies in a variety of informal ways, while not asking
for any more cash.
The report says that in 1991 non-executive directors devoted 15 days a year
to working on the affairs of each company on whose boards they sat. This
figure has risen to 22 days a year, while the average fee per directorship
has stayed at about Pounds 15,000 a year.
According to 3i this 'spectacular' productivity increase shows that most
non-executives are 'less concerned with the size of their fees than with
being usefully involved'.
The report was based on a survey of 272 non-executives with a total of 767
appointments.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Troubled gestation for new entitlements: Bringing UK
maternity rights in line with EU law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employers' organisations are reporting confusion among companies over new
maternity rights introduced yesterday.
There are also fears that the changes, designed to bring UK law into line
with the European Union directive on the health and safety of pregnant
women, might deter some companies from employing women.
Ms Dianah Worman, policy adviser on equal opportunities at the Institute of
Personnel and Development, said: 'The worry is that some companies may see
the changes as too much hassle for them and that there may be a backlash
against employing women as a result.'
The complexities of the system are also leading to concerns among employers
that if they make an administrative mistake in the way they interpret the
rules they could expose themselves to legal challenges.
The new system means that where previously women had to work for two years
before they qualified for their legal rights to maternity leave, they now
have a statutory right to at least 14 weeks' maternity leave regardless of
their length of service or hours of work.
Protection against dismissal and the right to alternative work or suspension
on full pay where a job is harmful to health is also guaranteed.
The changes are made more complex, however, because of higher entitlements
for women with longer service. Full-time women workers who have two or more
years of continuous service with their employer and women with five years'
service who work fewer than 16 hours a week but more than eight hours are
entitled to 40 weeks' leave - 11 weeks before the birth and 29 weeks
afterwards.
The new arrangement also gives women employees up to 18 weeks' pay while on
maternity leave if they have worked for at least 26 weeks prior to the 12
weeks before the baby's birth.
Maternity pay entitlement is 90 per cent of their average earnings for six
weeks and Pounds 52.50 a week for the remaining 12 weeks. The Trades Union
Congress points out that the deal, which it says adds up to an equivalent of
eight weeks on full pay, trails other European countries. New mothers in
Denmark get 22 weeks' pay. In Italy they get 17 weeks' pay and in Greece 16
weeks' pay.
The TUC has accused the government of contributing to the confusion by
providing too little information. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary,
said: 'These new maternity rights are a step in the right direction but they
don't go far enough. Britain still has the worst record on maternity rights
in Europe.'
Many working women will remain excluded from the new rights. About 2.25m
women who earn less than Pounds 57 a week will fail to qualify for statutory
maternity leave, and part-timers with less than five years' service will
also have no access to maternity leave.
At present about one in four UK employers provides more than statutory
minimum entitlements.
Some, including the Civil Service and the National Health Service, offer up
to 52 weeks' leave and employers such as Thames Water make no distinction
between full time and part-time employees.
Employers are to be reimbursed with up to 92 per cent of the cost of
maternity pay. Small companies - which pay Pounds 20,000 or less a year in
gross National Insurance contributions - will be fully reimbursed.
The combined costs of the changes could amount to Pounds 65m a year to
employers.
The Federation of Small Businesses warned that the new maternity rights were
placing one more social burden on employers that could deter small employers
from recruiting more staff. Mr Stephen Alambrits, parliamentary officer,
said: 'If this sort of thing continues we will end up with a jobless
recovery.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Navy's last diesel-powered submarine, HMS Unicorn, sailed into
mothballs yesterday - just 15 months after being accepted into service. The
move is a result of the end of the Cold War.
When Unicorn was designed the Cold War was still on and the role of the
Upholder Class was to release nuclear submarines for tackling other Nato
roles.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Standards for plugs proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The controversy over the future of the UK's 13-amp plug and socket system
has moved into its final stages with publication by the British Standards
Institution of two draft standards for a harmonised European system.
The standards, eagerly awaited by the plug and socket industry, consumer
associations and safety experts, are for a system using a plug with two
round pins, and for an adapter to facilitate a changeover to the system.
The standards have been produced by a technical committee of Cenelec, the
Brussels-based electrical standards body for Europe. They are the
culmination of years of lobbying among the 18 member countries of Cenelec,
which run about 20 conflicting plug and socket systems.
The Cenelec members will vote by March on the new system. If approved,
conflicting standards such as the UK's BS1363, on which the 13-amp
rectangular-pin plug is based, would have to be dropped - unless opposing
countries were to seek an exemption or derogation.
A BSI technical committee will cast the UK's vote, and the institute said it
was establishing a deadline of December 31 for public comments, to give the
committee two months to weigh up opinion.
Mr Ian Campbell, head of the BSI's electrical standards development
department, said: 'We want to make absolutely sure that we have reached a
consensus in this country before entering the wider arena.'
Some British safety experts have said that the proposed plugs could be
inserted dangerously into existing UK sockets and that the unfused European
plugs would not be safe with the current British ring networks. European
electrical supplies work on a radial network.
But supporters of the proposal reject these arguments, and say a
standardised European system would benefit consumers and appliance
manufacturers because of reduced costs and product compatibility across
Europe.
BSI's role in the saga has also been criticised, with supporters of the
proposal claiming that its technical committee is too weighted towards the
interests of UK plug and socket manufacturers.
The BSI has rejected this, stressing that it acts only as a facilitator for
its committees, and has no commercial interest in, or influence over, their
conclusions.

FT  17 OCT 94 / McDonald's staff told not to mince their words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDonald's, the fast-food chain, has found that its service with a smile is
proving too much to chew on for the British stiff upper lip.
The company which brought American 'Have-a-nice-day' culture to nearly every
high street in Britain has told its restaurant managers across the country
to serve customers the way they like best.
Ms Carmell Flatley, the company's assistant vice-president of human
resources, said a survey of staff and customers found that people had become
unhappy with the 'robotic' service in McDonald's restaurants.
She told Personnel Management Plus magazine: 'A lot of customers felt we
were too mechanistic. They wanted more warmth over the counter. It was only
through our research that we discovered they thought we were a bit brash, a
bit arrogant.'
Staff were equally uncomfortable with the approach and complained of having
to say 'Thank you, please call again,' to every customer.
McDonald's is now training its 550 restaurant managers to be more flexible
and responsive to local needs.
This would allow the use of colloquialisms and local dialect, it said.
If deemed fit by managers, McDonald's customers may be greeted by phrases
such as 'Eh-up, chuck,' or 'Get that down your neck' or 'here's your Big
Mac, whack'.
Anything but, it seems, 'Have a nice day.' The company stressed: 'We never
have said that in Britain.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / 200 L&amp;G staff told to vie for 100 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Legal &amp; General, one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, is in effect
sacking half its top life-products managers by asking all 200 of them to
re-apply for only 100 jobs.
The managers who survive the cull will be hired on new contracts. These will
tie remuneration to factors such as ability to cope with customer demands
and compliance with new insurance industry regulations, and not to sales
volumes.
The aim of the re-organisation, to take effect next month, is to emphasise
the company's commitment to a highly ethical method of selling pensions and
other life products after recent public criticism of life-industry sales
practices.
The changes come as the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief
regulator, finishes drawing up a report which sets out mechanisms for
dealing with compensation claims from people who believe they were mis-sold
pensions in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It is thought claims across the
life industry will total at least Pounds 500m.
The company said its management changes were linked to the need to improve
standards among its managers and agents selling life products. It aimed to
keep 'the best people' from its 200 existing managers, who are based in
regional offices and who each typically supervise about 10 sales agents.
As part of the reorganisation it is greatly reducing opportunities for
managers to earn big sums from agents' sales.
Instead of their earnings being based partly on an 'override' of agents' own
sales commissions, these executives will have a basic salary of about Pounds
15,000. On top of this relatively small commissions will be paid, depending
on how well the managers satisfy customers' requirements in areas such as
collection of premiums and speed of reaction to inquiries.
The managers will also qualify for other commission payments, according to
how well they organise the recording of details about customers' financial
and personal circumstances when they are sold new products.
Such record keeping in the industry has been acknowledged to have been poor
in the past. Companies are having to improve in this area to meet tighter
consumer-protection regulations being introduced by the Personal Investment
Authority, the new regulator to protect private investors.
In the past insurance managers in some branches of the industry have been
able to earn more than Pounds 100,000 a year through 'sales override'.
Although estimates are difficult, it is thought that under the new
arrangements the company's managers will earn far less than this.
It is instituting its new arrangements for managers as part of a plan to
reduce the number of its sales agents. Unlike its managers, they are mainly
self-employed and paid commission only. The number of sales agents is
intended to fall from 2,300 at the beginning of the year to about 1,000 by
the end. In the late 1980s Legal and General had about 3,000 sales agents.
Announcing the company's latest financial results last month Mr David
Prosser, chief executive, said he saw little prospect of short-term
improvement in the difficult conditions of the UK market. He predicted
increased competition and narrower margins next year.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Societies set for long legal battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two building societies face the prospect of a long legal battle with the
Investors Compensation Scheme over damages for investors in home income
plans.
The scheme confirmed yesterday that it had started legal proceedings against
the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and West Bromwich building societies over the
plans, which involved money raised by mortgages on investors' houses being
invested in bonds.
Many home income plan investors have lost money in recent years as a result
of fluctuating interest rates and investment returns, and falling house
prices. The plans have, in effect, been banned by City regulators.
C &amp; G and West Bromwich provided mortgages for the plans. But the writs
issued at the High Court late on Friday allege that the societies, in
conjunction with the now-defunct financial advisers who recommended the
plans, 'devised, operated and marketed' the scheme - an allegation the
societies are expected to strongly deny.
Writs have also been issued against two firms of solicitors involved in the
plans.
An early warning that the scheme was likely to take legal action came this
month when the organisation rescinded a compensation agreement worth Pounds
545,000 which was struck with the C&amp;G two years ago. The scheme, which
offers a rescue fund for private clients of failed authorised investment
groups, argued that new information suggested the building society's
contribution was insufficient.
The scheme said it would pursue the legal proceedings it had started. It may
be a year before the case comes to court.
So far the ICS has paid Pounds 12m of compensation to 900 clients of
financial advisers Fisher Prew-Smith and Pounds 5.5m to 242 clients of
advisers Aylesbury Associates.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Nissan UK fights Pounds 20m damages suit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nissan UK, the former independent British importer/distributor of Nissan
vehicles controlled by Mr Octav Botnar, is being sued by a former dealer for
damages totalling Pounds 20.5m, according to its latest annual report.
The report says the company is contesting the claim, which is expected to be
heard by the High Court next month.
Nissan UK, which lost the lucrative Nissan franchise in Britain with effect
from the end of 1991 - when Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, took over
the role of importer/distributor and triggered a fierce legal battle between
the two companies - is contesting tax assessments from the Inland Revenue
totalling Pounds 238m.
The annual report says that the Inland Revenue has failed on two occasions
in front of the Special Commissioners of the Inland Revenue to obtain any
payment on account. A third such hearing arranged for last July was
adjourned at the Inland Revenue's request and no date had yet been fixed for
a full hearing of Nissan UK's appeal.
The company will 'contest the assessments in the strongest possible manner
as being without foundation,' says the annual report, which was signed on
September 29.
The report covers the financial period for the 12 months to the end of July
1993 and discloses the impact of the loss of the Nissan franchise.
According to the latest annual report of Nissan UK Holdings, which owns 100
per cent of Nissan UK, Nissan UK Holdings' turnover in the year to the end
of July 1993 fell to Pounds 15.55m from Pounds 318.4m in 1991-92. Of the
Pounds 15.55m, Pounds 8.98m came from discontinued operations and Pounds
5.58m from continuing activities. The group made a pre-tax loss in 1992-93
of Pounds 11.34m compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 19.3m a year
earlier.
In 1990-91 the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 65.4m on a turnover of
Pounds 599.4m. The report says that since the loss of the Nissan franchise
the 'nucleus' of the company's business has been based on property.
A number of properties previously leased to dealers for the Nissan franchise
continued to be leased to 'third parties with motor trade interests', and
the company had purchased other properties.
The company's intention was 'to maximise income and profits from Nissan UK's
property portfolio in the hope that the market for retail garage properties
will improve'.
The company says it wrote down the value of its property portfolio by about
Pounds 8m in a revaluation at the end of July 1993, owing to the depressed
property market.
Separately, Nissan UK has written off Pounds 31.3m from its revaluation
reserve in the values of property and subsidiary companies in 1991-92 and
1992-93, reducing the reserve to Pounds 3.04m at the end of July 1993 from
Pounds 34.3m two years earlier.
Kidsons Impey, auditor for Nissan UK Holdings, says that because of the
outstanding unresolved tax assessments from the Inland Revenue against
Nissan UK it has been unable to form an opinion on whether the accounts give
a 'true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company'.
It says that it has been advised that evidence is likely to be submitted
which cannot for legal reasons be made available to it. It adds: 'We have
not obtained all the information and explanations that we considered
necessary for the purpose of our audit and we were unable to determine
whether proper accounting records had been maintained.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Feltrim action to start this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The next chapter in the long-running Lloyd's of London legal saga opens this
week when more than 1,600 members of the insurance market start a fresh High
Court battle to win compensation for 1980s losses.
The Feltrim Names' Association hopes to repeat the success of the Gooda
Walker action group earlier this month. It won millions of pounds of damages
for losses by Names involved in 'spiral' insurance - by which underwriters
agreed to cover others for excessive losses from catastrophes.
The Feltrim association is claiming a total of Pounds 600m in three legal
cases.
The first, originally scheduled to start today but now not expected to get
under way until tomorrow, covers losses dating from between 1987 and 1989.
The case is the latest in a series of legal actions mounted by Lloyd's Names
which may stretch into the next century.
The Court of Appeal is expected to rule in the next few weeks whether Names
have a case for challenging Lloyd's legal right to reclaim money spent on
their behalf out of its central fund, which protects insurance policies for
Lloyd's clients. A victory for the Writs Response Group would hamper Lloyd's
attempts to claim an estimated Pounds 1.3bn outstanding from lossmaking
Names.
Even if the Names do not win outright the possibility of a further appeal to
the Lords and then the European Court could delay settlement of the amounts
outstanding for several years. Also expected soon is a decision by the
defendants in the Gooda Walker case on whether to appeal.
The Feltrim case centres on allegations that the professional Lloyd's
agencies involved in the catastrophe 'spiral' were negligent.
Names on Feltrim syndicates were badly hit by a succession of disasters
including the 1988 Piper Alpha oil platform accident.
The weight of legal action facing Lloyd's professional agencies has
increased the pressure for an out-of-court settlement.
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names' Association, said the Gooda
Walker judgment opened a 'window of opportunity' for such a deal - at least
for the 'spiral' cases.
He said many of the Names' action groups regarded a new settlement as the
most sensible route for Lloyd's, but added that 'if one thinks one is being
successful, the price goes up'.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Citizen's Charter an 'irrelevance'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's Citizen's Charter scheme is a publicity stunt which is
being used by only a handful of people, says a survey today.
A poll of 1,000 people by NOP for the Trades Union Congress found only 2 per
cent had used one of the charters, set up to improve public services,
including British Rail.
Only one in three had seen a copy of the charters, just one in 10 had read
the documents - and only 16 people said they were satisfied with them.
Two out of three people questioned described the charter as a 'public
relations exercise'.
Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said: 'Our poll shows that the
Citizen's Charter is an expensive irrelevance which plays no part in
delivering quality in our public services.
'It goes unseen, unread and unused by a vast majority of British citizens.
Taxpayers' money would be better spent on funding services properly.'
The survey also found resistance to private companies running public
services such as hospitals, schools, leisure facilities and refuse
collection.
Mr Monks said: 'These findings support the view of trade unions that the
privatisation of our public services does not have the backing of those who
pay for them and use them.'
The poll was released as part of the TUC's public services week, which is
aimed at highlighting cuts in public spending and the effects of
privatisation.
As part of the campaign, leaders of the three rail unions will tour the
country to complain that Pounds 700m has been 'wasted' on rail
privatisation.

The staff canteen is a 'substantial perk' worth at least Pounds 300 a year
to workers, a report says today.
The survey of 800 businesses by the Industrial Society and Touche Ross
Management Consultants says more workers than ever use office restaurants
because of the harsh realities of the economic climate.
Most of those surveyed contracted out catering services, with companies
paying an average subsidy of Pounds 328.90 a year per worker.

Small businesses today urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to use next
month's Budget to 'help the minnows'.
The Federation of Small Businesses said its members were starved of cash
badly needed to expand.
Mr John Harris, federation chairman, said: 'Easing their capital block can
only be done by allowing businesses to retain their profits - and taxed only
when the money is drawn for non-business purposes.'
In its pre-Budget submission the federation says Mr Clarke should ease the
regulatory burden by cutting red tape and abolishing value added tax on
inter-company trading.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half of all working adults in some parts of Britain are dependent on
the state for their jobs, the GMB general union says today.
Most affected are Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales but some areas of the
south are also heavily dependent on the state, according to the union.
Nearly 6m workers are employed by the state. The most concentrated number is
in Castle Morpeth in Scotland, where 52.6 per cent are employed in the
public sector. In Durham 51.9 per cent are employed by the state, followed
by Oxford with 47.8 per cent, Carmarthen, Dyfed with 46.9 per cent, Bath in
Avon with 45.7 per cent and Wandsworth in south London with 45.5 per cent.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Howe warns on Tory EU rebels
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Howe, the former foreign secretary, warned yesterday that Conservatives
could hand a general election victory to Labour if Euro-scepticism was
allowed to flourish in Tory ranks.
His warning about the risk from the right of the party came amid reports
that he and other senior Tory figures would be forming a policy group to
argue the case for Europe.
The group, said to include Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, Mr David Hunt,
chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Sir Leon Brittan, the European
commissioner, will also involve several prominent people from the business
community.
Pro-European Tories are anxious to counter the arguments of the Euro-sceptic
lobby. The party's rift over Europe was reopened at its conference in
Bournemouth last week when Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor,
suggested that Britain could leave the European Union.
But Lord Howe, echoing his conference pleas on ITV's Walden programme
yesterday, said: 'We have this great danger of our sliding into a
Euro-sceptic mode and Euro-scepticism spreading through the party and at
worst to the nation - the last thing we want.
'And if it happens, we enhance considerably the risk of a Labour government
and all that follows from that.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Safety inspectors probe train collision in Kent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Railway Inspectorate yesterday launched an investigation into a head-on
collision in Kent on Saturday which killed five and injured 11.
Several theories have been advanced to explain how the crash occurred on a
single-track stretch converted from double-track five years ago.
People living near the line, which runs from Oxted to Uckfield via a number
of village stations, complained at the time that a crash was 'inevitable'.
Concern centred on how two trains came to be travelling in opposite
directions on the same section - when they should have passed each other on
a double-track loop - on the quality of rolling stock, and on safety
systems.
It is possible that heavy fog in the area just before 9.00am, when the crash
occurred, was a factor.
Yesterday two inspectors at the scene were concentrating on checking the
signals and supervising the removal of the wreckage. One body remained
trapped.
Mr Chris Jago, a director of Railtrack, the state-owned track and signal
company, said there was nothing 'inherently wrong' with the single-track
system on the line, and that signalling had been replaced with modern
equipment about six years ago.
A red light should have stopped any train from entering a single-track
section of line already occupied by another, he said.
The rolling stock involved in the crash was more than 30 years old. There
was speculation that more modern carriages would have withstood the impact
better.
Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, promised that any lessons of
the inquiry would be acted on.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Feudal title holder claims Pounds 1bn slice of Jersey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERSEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A private Jersey-based development company is using a feudal title to lay
claim to the industrial foreshore of St Helier, the island's capital,
estimated to be worth at least Pounds 1bn.
Les Pas Holdings claims it owns the most developed section of the foreshore,
including most of the island's busy harbour, the main power station, the
fuel farm, a new underpass and most of a big area of reclaimed land.
The claim is being vigorously contested by crown officers in Jersey, the
largest of the Channel Islands.
The figure at the centre of the bizarre wrangle is Advocate Richard Falle,
one of the island's leading lawyers and a director of Les Pas.
Eight years ago he and a group of businessmen submitted plans for a
commercial marina which they said would help alleviate the island's housing
problem and boost tourism.
The plan has been strongly opposed by conservationists, and a protest group
called Save Our Shoreline has mounted a sustained campaign to stop the
building of the marina.
At about the same time Les Pas also acquired the seigneur's feudal rights,
known as Le Fief de la Fosse. This includes rights over the foreshore that
traditionally extended as far as the seigneur could ride his horse into the
sea at low tide.
Mr Falle said he has become so frustrated by delays over the marina plan
that he is invoking the ancient title. 'I am bitterly disappointed with what
I believe to be politicking at every level,' he said.
'I still believe this scheme is the best and most constructive idea for the
development of Jersey's economy this century.'
The company claims its feudal rights over the foreshore include ownership.
Fiefdoms date back to Norman law and many landowners have fought similar, if
smaller cases in the UK.
Both Les Pas and the crown officers have commissioned leading QCs to
ascertain the validity of the feudal title claim, and Les Pas has registered
its claim with Jersey's Royal Court.
According to confidential committee documents, Mr Terry Sowden, a former
Jersey solicitor-general, advised the States, the island's parliament, that
Les Pas's claim had no foundation in law.
Miss Stephanie Nicolle, the present solicitor-general, has confirmed that if
Les Pas were to win, it would own everything built on the disputed territory
in perpetuity. In a letter to a senior civil servant, she warned: 'The
consequences of failure (by the authorities to win) do not bear
contemplation.'
Mr Falle said he is prepared to fight all the way to the European Court to
secure what he believes is Les Pas's rightful title. Senator Reg Jeune,
president of the States' policy and resources committee, Jersey's cabinet,
declined to comment.
In February the States approved a new Pounds 25m reclamation scheme on the
foreshore aimed at solving the island's waste-disposal problems, in spite of
the threat of possible court action against it over ownership.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Staff canteen 'perk' worth Pounds 300 a year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The staff canteen is a 'substantial perk' worth at least Pounds 300 a year
to workers, a report says today.
The survey of 800 businesses by the Industrial Society and Touche Ross
Management Consultants says more workers than ever use office restaurants
because of the harsh realities of the economic climate.
Most of those surveyed contracted out catering services, with companies
paying an average subsidy of Pounds 328.90 a year per worker. Some paid up
to Pounds 600.
More than half the 500,000 workers covered by the survey said that they used
the staff canteen.
The Industrial Society said: 'We are seeing a new, competitive era for staff
restaurants and employees are realising what good value they really are.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Business 'minnows' in call to Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Small businesses today urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to use next
month's Budget to 'help the minnows'.
The Federation of Small Businesses said its members were starved of cash
badly needed to expand.
Mr John Harris, federation chairman, said: 'Easing their capital block can
only be done by allowing businesses to retain their profits and taxed only
when the money is drawn for non-business purposes.'
In its pre-Budget submission the federation says Mr Clarke should ease the
regulatory burden by cutting red tape and abolishing value added tax on
inter-company trading.
Dr Bernard Juby, federation financial affairs chairman, said: 'It has long
been a bone of contention that all VAT collected at the various interim
stages is ultimately claimed back at no gain to the Exchequer. Last year
alone Pounds 25bn was locked up in the VAT system of payments and repayments
and the abolition of VAT on inter-company trading is now long overdue.'
Other proposals include two-tier base rates with a lower rate for business
borrowers, and extending Tessas to businesses.

FT  17 OCT 94 / State 'provides jobs for 50%'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly half of all working adults are dependent on the state for their jobs
in some parts of Britain, the GMB general union says today.
Most affected are Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales but some areas of the
south are also heavily dependent on the state, according to the union.
Nearly 6m workers are employed by the state. The most concentrated number is
in Castle Morpeth in Scotland, where 52.6 per cent are employed in the
public sector. In Durham 51.9 per cent are employed by the state, followed
by Oxford with 47.8 per cent, Carmarthen, Dyfed with 46.9 per cent, Bath in
Avon with 45.7 per cent and Wandsworth in south London with 45.5 per cent.
When analysed by parliamentary constituency the numbers were more striking.
Top was Tooting in south London with 56.6 per cent, followed by Sheffield
Hallam with 57.6 per cent.
Full-time employment in the public sector has fallen 11.5 per cent in the
past 10 years, the survey says.
Mr Mick Graham of the GMB said: 'An industry that provides employment to 30
per cent of Britain's workers and delivers vital services to the public is
the cornerstone of the British economy.
'The time has come for the public to realise that their economic and social
well-being depends upon a thriving public sector in their area.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Portillo to shake up training scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, has decided to shake up the
main government scheme for training unemployed adults by cutting its funding
by a third and introducing performance-related pay for the Training and
Enterprise Councils which deliver it.
Mr Portillo's initiative reflects growing scepticism, especially in the
Treasury, about whether the Pounds 762m spent on Training for Work, the
scheme for the adult unemployed, represents good value for money.
It also reflects the belief that too many Tecs are failing to deliver good
enough outcomes for those who go through the scheme. Only 22 per cent of the
120,000 people who completed six-month courses in England and Wales in
1993-94 had a 'positive outcome', meaning either a job, self-employment, or
a move into further education. A further 36 per cent achieved a National
Vocational Qualification.
In order to improve on these figures, and in particular the number going
into jobs, the employment department has decided that from next April all
the Tecs in England and Wales will switch to output-related funding.
That means about 75 per cent of the funds Tecs receive for putting somebody
through Training for Work will be dependent on a positive outcome. At
present more than 70 per cent is paid regardless of what happens to the
trainee after the course.
This will have serious consequences for many of the companies to which Tecs
send their trainees. Officials in both government and the Tecs believe that
too many companies are making too much money from providing courses which do
little to help the unemployed. Many courses concentrate purely on providing
people with NVQs with no connection at all to the jobs market.
An experiment with output-related funding in 12 Tecs has produced
encouraging results. Mr Doug Norris of the North London Tec said that
positive outcomes improved from 20 per cent to 49 per cent as a result of
the trial.
He said: 'The upturn in the economy has helped a bit but it is basically
because we are no longer just paying for a process but for an outcome. It
has allowed me to kick out the training providers who were not getting
results.'
Mr Chris Humphries of the Tec National Council said he would welcome a move
to output funding for all Tecs.
He said: 'This is something which demonstrably works and we have been asking
for this for some time.'
The Tecs are also likely to welcome the fact that trainees in future will be
allowed greater flexibility to do parts of an NVQ rather than the whole
qualification.
But other aspects of Mr Portillo's package may be less welcome to Tecs. The
amount of money available for Training for Work is likely to be cut to less
than Pounds 600m. And poorly performing Tecs may have their contract to
train the adult unemployed removed from them completely.
Some Tec officials also fear that the benefits of the shake-up could be
undermined by any attempt - hinted at by Mr Portillo in his speech to the
Conservative party conference last week - to make receipt of benefit
dependent on taking a training place.
'If anything we should be moving the other way. When training courses are
difficult to get on to trainees are much more enthusiastic about them. If
they are made compulsory the attitude will be terrible,' said one Tec
official.
Such a move might also reverse a marked improvement in attitudes towards
Training for Work among participants. Opinion research with eight groups of
participants by the consultancy Full Employment UK has found a substantial
shift compared with two years ago.
Most participants now say that they are on proper training schemes and
believe that the government is broadly supportive. They also value the fact
that the courses are voluntary.
Eight groups of unemployed people who are not on courses continued to
reflect the negative attitude towards government schemes. Most said that the
courses were just a way of keeping the number of registered unemployed down,
said Mr Peter Ashby of Full Employment UK.

FT  17 OCT 94 / RMT had 'no prospect' of winning Railtrack dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Railtrack lost the propaganda battle against the RMT rail union but won
almost everything else, including a refusal to pay for past productivity,
according to Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's human resources director.
Mr Armstrong told the magazine Personnel Management: 'The press and public
support for the signalworkers may have given them heart, but the RMT never
had a prospect of winning the dispute. They chose the wrong issue to be in
dispute on and it was doomed to failure from the start.'
Mr Armstrong said that the RMT's mistake was to insist on payments for past
productivity. 'No employer in this day and age, and particularly one that is
government-owned, can concede an 11 per cent pay rise based on the past', he
said.
According to Mr Armstrong the turning point came when the RMT agreed to
negotiate on both past and future productivity.
He said: 'Apart from annualised hours and the inclusion of Sunday in the
working week, we have secured everything we were looking for. Sunday working
will be on a voluntary basis, but if somebody doesn't volunteer we can
roster them to work.'
Annualised hours - meaning greater variability of hours within a fixed
annual limit - were withdrawn from negotiations by the company in June but
Mr Armstrong said he was still keen to use pilot studies to test their
suitability for the railways. 'We want to have further discussions with the
trade unions,' he said.

GIFT SHOP
The unusually hot summer subdued sales at Collectables, a gift shop in the
Metro Centre in Tyne and Wear. 'The weather affected most of retailing,'
said proprietor, Mr Philip Lewis. 'When the weather is good people are on
the lakes and on the beaches so these things are hard to monitor
year-to-year.' He said sales had grown by about 5 per cent from the previous
year, and that Sunday trading was adding an additional 12 per cent. The
April tax increases had not negatively affected business,
FLORIST
In the three months from July to September, the eight branches of Dingley's
florist in central Manchester and North Cheshire saw a rise in sales volumes
of about 10 per cent from the same period last year. 'Our costs are up by
about 20 to 25 per cent, but we are generally holding our prices about the
same as last year,' said owner Mr Graham Heap. 'Total sales volumes are up
because of an improvement in attitude. This time last year people were
struggling to pay Pounds 15 but now they seem happy to spend Pounds 20 or
more.'
BUTCHER
The Tesco store which opened in Medway last February has shaved 15 per cent
off sales at Bruce Butchers. Mr David Bruce, owner, said he has brought down
prices at his family-owned butcher by about 5 per cent, in spite of the fact
that his costs have risen by 6 to 7 per cent. 'We have had to drop our
prices to try and keep people coming,' he said. 'It is hard to compete
against a superstore which also has Sunday trading.' Loyal customers stick
to cheaper cuts of meat, such as mince.
CLOTHES SHOP
'There is more optimism among shoppers this year,' said Ms Pam Jewitt, owner
of No Sweat, a leisure clothing shop in the Metro Centre in Tyne and Wear.
Her sales figures for August were 18 per cent up on the same month last year
and prices were up by between 5 and 8 per cent on last year. She plans to
expand to a third shop in the Metro Centre. She added that people were
looking for affordable merchandise. The shop has stopped importing products
from Germany and the US and now focuses its stock on UK product lines.
GROCERS
Independent grocers, increasingly finding their business eroded by the large
retail chains, have not enjoyed the boom in food prices indicated by recent
figures from the Central Statistics Office. 'I would not go along with those
figures at all,' said Mr Les Brown, national treasurer of the British
Independent Grocers' Association. 'I would say prices are more like 2 per
cent up on last year.' Mr Brown sais that in his convenience stores in
Hertfordshire sales volumes were about the same as last year.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Tiny rival attacks Branson over cola name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Branson, the Virgin company chairman who appears to delight in
challenging the supremacy of established organisations such as British
Airways and Coca-Cola, is himself coming under attack from a minnow
competitor.
Mr Ric Huning, a businessman who has been operating a small group of
companies called the Elfin Group from Wales, says he, and not Mr Branson,
was the originator of the idea of a Virgin Cola drink.
Last week, with a great deal of fizz, Mr Branson announced the launch of
Virgin Cola. The drink will initially be distributed mainly through Tesco
supermarkets in the UK.
Mr Huning says he first presented the Cola concept to Virgin in 1992 but
that in January 1993 the organisation rejected the idea.
Virgin has confirmed that the following letter was sent to Mr Huning on 28th
January last year from a Virgin company executive, Mr Craig Dixon: 'Thank
you for your letter of 11th January 1993. Your idea for 'Virgin Cola' looks
very interesting and I am sure it would be a great success.
'However, we are currently concentrating investment on ideas which fit in
with our existing businesses.
'Unfortunately your idea is a little too far removed from those businesses
to be of interest to us. I wish you luck with your endeavours and thank you
for considering Virgin.'
Following this letter Mr Huning said that he started discussions about
manufacturing and marketing Virgin Cola himself.
But then, according to Mr Huning: 'Somebody in the (Virgin) organisation
must have decided somewhere through 1993 that it was a damn good idea and
they should really do it.'
Round one in the battle has already been lost by Mr Huning. In July this
year Virgin gained an interim injunction in the High Court preventing Mr
Huning from using the Virgin Cola name in the UK.
Harbottle &amp; Lewis, Virgin's lawyers in London, said that the letter from Mr
Dixon was 'written by mistake in the middle of an extremely aggressive set
of correspondence' between the firm and Mr Huning.
This correspondence made it clear to Mr Huning that 'if he tried to go ahead
and use this (the Virgin Cola name) we'd come after him,' said Harbottle &amp;
Lewis.
Virgin said Mr Branson had said some years ago that he was thinking of going
into the soft drinks business.
Mr Huning had been told a long time ago that 'Cola wasn't about an idea  -
it was an obvious idea. It was about a formula, and we needed someone to
bring us the formula.'
Mr Huning, who has subsequently fallen out with two of his fellow directors
and seen the collapse of his main trading company, remains undeterred.
He may be prevented from launching Virgin Cola in the UK, but says he is
poised to launch in the US, and is also pressing ahead in Australia and
South Africa.
Mr Huning said this was being done with the backing of a consortium of
international businessmen.
Meanwhile, Virgin is preparing for round two.
The company's lawyers said: 'We are going to take all and any necessary
action against Mr Huning wherever he sees fit to make these allegations.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Smaller traders battle for profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MOTOKO RICH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The monthly statistics designed to present a composite picture of retail
behaviour often mask a wide range of experience on the ground, especially
among small businesses.
Mr Roy O'Connor, who owns variety stores in Birmingham, Shrewsbury and
Hereford, said: 'I talk to a lot of people in the retail trade and right
across the spectrum sales are on the floor. So where they get their
government figures from I do not know.'
On the other hand, Mr Richard Cooke, manager of the Bull Ring Centre, a
covered market for discount shops in Birmingham - where Mr O'Connor owns a
store - said retailers had 'had an exceedingly good year'.
Mr Cooke said Sunday trading had brought merchants an extra 5 per cent in
sales values. 'We feel that with Sunday trading, we can get more families
shopping,' he said. 'People on their own are generally hesitant to spend,
but get the family together and they will make decisions to spend.'
Mr John Morell, owner of JM Engraving, a down-market jeweller in the Bull
Ring Centre, said sales were up by about 3 per cent to 4 per cent on last
year, about in line with the CSO's retail sales figures. But, he said:
'Prices have not changed one iota.'
Mr O'Connor said that if anything, clothing prices had fallen about 5 per
cent in the past year. 'We have started to import a lot of goods and prices
have dropped and margins have come down,' he said.
Mr O'Connor said discounters might be suffering more acutely than the larger
chains. 'For the past five of six discounters have been the name of the
game. But with people now getting some job security and married couples both
bringing in incomes, they tend to go to hypermarkets or use their credit
cards at M &amp; S and Next, rather than coming to the independent discounters.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Business mood at six-year peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business leaders are more confident about the economy than at any time since
1988, says a survey published today by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business
information company.
While construction companies and exporters of manufactured goods are the
most optimistic about increasing sales and profits in the last quarter of
this year, many retailers are still relatively gloomy as a result of only
sluggish increases in consumer spending and concerns about the impact of
last month's increase in interest rates.
Even with the warning that many retailers face a poor Christmas the latest
snapshot of industry opinion will be welcomed by the Treasury, which wants
to create foundations for long-term growth through a non-inflationary
recovery led by industry.
Indications of greater confidence among businesses are supported by a survey
from Lombard Business Finance, a finance and leasing group, which says the
main reason companies are investing is to increase capacity rather than to
improve efficiency.
In September 52 per cent of respondents planning to invest were doing so to
increase capacity, compared with 39 per cent three months earlier, according
to the survey.
Meanwhile, another report out today from the Henley Centre, an economic
consultancy, warns that consumers are increasingly out of step with
Britain's boardrooms in failing to feel cheered by signs of upturn from the
early 1990s recession.
The report says the government, if it wants to win the next general
election, may have to do more to make consumers feel that they are
benefiting from the characteristics of low inflation, higher exports and
increased investment that have so far characterised the recovery.
It says: 'The job of striking the right balance between appearing virtuous
(over the economy) and satisfying voters' desire for rising living standards
will become an increasingly difficult one.'
In the Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey a balance of 59 percentage points of
companies said they expected to increase sales in the last quarter compared
with 12 months previously. The balance is the percentage of respondents
forecasting an increase, minus those expecting a decrease.
The figure for the balance compared with 51 points a year ago. It was the
highest for a fourth quarter since 1988.
The survey was conducted among 1,600 managing directors and took place
between September 28 and October 6, just after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, increased bank base rates from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent.
Companies were similarly upbeat in other areas that Dun &amp; Bradstreet reckons
affect overall business confidence. These areas include companies' thoughts
about the possibilities of increasing profits and taking on new staff.
A balance of 48 percentage points expected new orders in the fourth quarter
to exceed those a year ago, well up on the 36 points recorded for the final
quarter of 1993.
The general mood of bullishness contrasts with less sanguine attitudes among
retailers. According to the survey a balance of just 28 percentage points of
stores are looking for higher sales in the last quarter, while a mere 4
percentage points expect order books to increase.
The survey showed business leaders in north-west England, the Midlands and
Wales to be the most optimistic.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Chains expect Christmas improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumer confidence has shown some improvement recently, and predictions of
a difficult Christmas for retailers may be proved wrong, according to Sir
Malcolm Field, managing director of WH Smith, the newspaper, books and music
group.
His cautiously optimistic views reflect those of a number of retailers which
have reported results recently. WH Smith experienced a slow midsummer period
but things improved in late summer and early autumn.
That partly reflected the arrival of cooler weather after the July heatwave,
and some improvement in sentiment.
He said: 'There is some underlying improvement in confidence, but the
question is, is it sustainable? I think Christmas will be good, but only the
best chains will win. You have to fight for every sale these days.'
Sir Malcolm added that he often felt official retail sales figures did not
reflect what was happening on the high street 'I sometimes wonder who is
contributing to them.'
Among other retailers, Storehouse - the clothing group which includes BHS
and Mothercare - issued a trading statement earlier this month saying that
sales for the six months to October were expected to be up by about 10 per
cent. Next, the fashion retailer, last month reported sales 13 per cent
ahead of last year.
Body Shop, the natural cosmetics retailer, said on Thursday that underlying
UK sales in the six months to the end of August were up 5 per cent -
compared with a 5 per cent fall in the same period last year.
However, Kingfisher, which includes the B&amp;Q, Woolworths, Comet and Superdrug
chains, said conditions remained tough, particularly in the DIY and
electrical goods sectors.
Competition on price also remains tough, holding inflation down.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Analysts delve into lucky dip of retail statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Easy profits are out, the canny consumer is king. That is the main message
from the retail sector as it prepares to enter the crucial Christmas trading
season.
But the question that will be raised this week, as a new set of retail data
is published, is how far this cautious consumer mentality is affecting sales
 -and with it the tools used to measure retail behaviour.
For with consumers adjusting to a new low-inflation environment, and the
nature of the retail sector itself changing, making sense of the various
sets of consumer data on offer is becoming an increasingly complex task.
For example, the official retail sales data, to be published by the Central
Statistical Office on Thursday, suggest that retail sales grew steadily this
year on the back of the recovery amid heavy price competition, but fell back
in August.
Some analysts suspect this dip was due to the summer holiday. But others say
that it points to a broader slowdown, not least because the Confederation of
British Industry's survey of distributive traders, published tomorrow, has
recently been adopting a more sober tone.
The CSO's consumer spending data, which is published on a quarterly basis,
is even more downbeat. It suggests sales of non-durable goods started to
drop as early as the spring.
This, however, would appear to be at odds with the Bank of England's data on
the level of notes and coins in circulation, previously a good guide to
consumer spending. These have been showing strong growth this year.
Meanwhile consumer credit data, published last week, put borrowing at a
record high.
For some economists this implies that there might be shortcomings in the
official statistics, not least because many retailers say their experiences
differ from the findings in the official data.
Mr Harry Moore, chief executive of Co-operative Retail Services, which has a
variety of retail outlets including supermarkets and department stores, said
he had little confidence in the figures.
He said: 'I often ask myself where the devil do they get these figures from?
I can't make head or tail of them. There is virtually no food inflation, for
example, but we are not aware of any consumer confidence.'
Mr Clive Vaughan, retail analyst at Verdict, the market research group, has
been puzzled and frustrated by the data in recent months.
However, economists such as Mr Chris Dillow of Nomura Research, disagree. He
said: 'I think the retail data is pretty good.' The signals all appeared to
be pointing to a temporary slowdown in spending as the tax increases took
effect.
Nevertheless, the real problem that may be confronting economists is that
tracking consumer behaviour is particularly difficult because of broader
changes occurring in this recovery. On the one hand, the nature of the
retail sector is changing as large retailers gain market share at the
expense of smaller ones and more retailers become multisector outlets.
Meanwhile, as last week's inflation data showed, underlying inflation is at
a record low, affecting retailers' perceptions and consumer behaviour.
The CSO collects its retail sales figures from about 5,000 retailers, of
which the bigger retailers generally account for most overall sales. Mr
Philip Gooding, CSO statistician, insists that the survey is representative.
But Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the Chambers of Commerce,
said: 'The official data do seem to hide the situation of smaller
retailers.'
Mr Ian Shepherdson, of Midland Global Markets, said this might explain the
recent puzzling trends in food retailsales, which were showing annual volume
growth of more than 5 per cent, far higher than other sectors.
This might reflect the fact that big chains have been gaining market share
because of supermarket price wars, he said. 'The CSO is almost certainly
capturing the entire gains in market share by the large retailers, but it
may be missing some of the small retailers' losses,' he said.
Analysis is made even harder because the CSO collects only a limited
commodity breakdown.
But if the official retail sales data are faced with the problem of shifting
market shares, surveys such as the CBI series face other problems.
Mr Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate economic director, believes low
inflation may lead some shopkeepers to understate their sales volumes
because heavy discounting leaves retailers with a particularly gloomy
impression of business.
In the long term, Mr Junankar says, the CBI survey - which covers 15,000
outlets - and the retail sales data have tended to track each other. But
observers such as Mr May remain cynical. 'Our feeling is that the CBI tends
to get it wrong nine times out of 10,' he said.
This discounting environment may also be affecting other series. Most
analysts believe the recent rise in the level of notes and coins in
circulation reflects the fact that low interest rates and inflation make it
more attractive to hold cash. Meanwhile, the recent surge in consumer credit
may reflect the fact that consumers are taking advantage of cheap financing.
Faced with this problem, most analysts conclude that the best solution to
the discrepancies is the most obvious - to use a basket of indicators.
As Mr David Mackie of JP Morgan points out, although the data might
sometimes seem to be at odds, the sheer variety represents something of a
luxury.
Spending on services represents almost half of consumer spending but data on
this sector is limited. Consequently the biggest mystery that may be
confronting economists as they try to make sense of consumer behaviour this
autumn may not be what is happening in the retail sector  - but what is
going on in all the other non-retail areas as well.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Asia: Kim Jong-il to be named leader soon - Public
appearance in Pyongyang points to his assumption of presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kim Jong-il's first public appearance in almost three months signals he
will soon be formally named as North Korea's new leader. Mr Kim attended a
memorial ceremony yesterday in Pyongyang, marking the end of the 100-day
mourning period for his father, the late President Kim Il-sung.
Analysts in Seoul believe the end of the mourning period will clear the way
for Mr Kim, last seen in public at his father's funeral on July 20, to
assume the presidency of the country and head the ruling Korean Workers'
Party in the next few weeks.
Mr Kim, who appeared somewhat haggard, was flanked by leading members of the
ruling hierarchy in an apparent show of unity. The absence of Mr Kim from
public view has led to speculation that his assumption of power may be
encountering internal opposition.
However, analysts believe he is already firmly in control of the government
and has avoided formally taking power during the mourning period because it
would appear unseemly, immediately after his father's death.
'Since the death of Kim Il-sung, there has been no sign of a power struggle
in North Korea, including a conflict with the military. Moreover, there are
no rival candidates at present who can compete against Kim Jong-il,' said Mr
Hideshi Takesada, a researcher at the National Institute for Defence Studies
in Japan.
'Kim Jong-il has been consolidating family loyalty by recruiting relatives
and classmates to major official positions. Over 90 per cent of officials
with the rank above chairmen in the party and state administration council
are those appointed by Kim Jong-il,' explained Mr Kil Jeong-woo, director of
policy studies at the Research Institute for National Unification in Seoul.
He also 'seems to have secured absolute support from the major figures in
charge of the three military organisations,' which have been mentioned as
the main source of possible opposition to his rule.
One sign of continued stability has been North Korea's negotiations with the
US over its nuclear programme, which have shown some signs of progress in
the past week. But weekend discussions in Geneva remained stuck over North
Korea's refusal to accept international inspection of undeclared suspect
nuclear facilities.
The talks, begun by Kim Il-sung, have shown little sign of deviation since
his death. 'Policy making in North Korea is the product of team work among
leading figures; Kim Il-sung's death did not have any drastic impact on
security strategy,' said Mr Gunter Unterbeck, a former East German diplomat
in Pyongyang.
However, Mr Kim may be forced to share more decision-making with the top
leadership than his father did.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Asia: Ford and Mazda may link in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive of Ford, the US vehicle maker,
said the group would decide 'within the next month' whether to produce cars
in Europe for sale under the Mazda badge.
Such a project has previously been rejected but it has been revived this
year following moves by Ford to establish a stronger influence over Mazda
management.
'We are studying again whether it is in our interests to give Mazda a
Ford-based vehicle in Europe,' said Mr Trotman. It would be 'a small
passenger car' and lead to higher levels of capacity utilisation at Ford
plants in Europe.
Mazda, which is 24.5 per cent owned by Ford, is the only one of the leading
Japanese carmakers without a car production base in Europe. Its sales in
west Europe have fallen by 10 per cent in the first 9 months this year
compared with a growth of 5 per cent in the overall market.
It is expected that a Mazda-badged Ford would be based on either the Ford
Fiesta or Ford Escort and built at one of Ford's European assembly plants in
Germany, the UK or Spain. Under a long established arrangement some Mazda
vehicles are sold under Ford badges in Asia. In Japan the Mazda 626 and the
Mazda 323/Familia are sold respectively as the Ford Telstar and the Ford
Laser.
Mr Trotman said that Mazda was unlikely to be used again to engineer a
mainstream car to be produced and sold by Ford in North America or Europe,
as was the case with the North American Ford Escort developed by Mazda.
'If we can design at the lowest cost and we have the human resources we will
do it,' he said. It was 'very likely' that the next generation Escort for
the European and North American markets would be developed by Ford in
Europe, he said.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Asia: Korean group in engines deal with Rover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rover, the UK subsidiary of BMW of Germany, has signed an agreement with
Kia, the second largest South Korean carmaker, to jointly develop a new
range of engines to be built in the UK and Korea.
Rover said that the joint engine development programme, the first it has
undertaken with a rival carmaker, would involve an investment of around
Pounds 30m.
It is understood that the agreement with Kia is for the development of a
range of V6 engines that will be developed from Rover's existing K-Series
small car engines.
The 2.5 litre Rover V6 is expected to be fitted first in the UK carmaker's
flagship Rover 800 executive car late next year replacing the Honda V6
engine currently imported from Japan. It will be produced at Rover's
Longbridge, Birmingham plant.
The Kia version of the V6 engine will be produced in Korea for use in a new
range of Kia executive cars under development.
Rover is in the midst of an ambitious programme to develop the highly
successful K-Series engine in order to give it far greater independence from
Honda, its Japanese partner, in engine production.
The K-Series, which was launched in 1.1 and 1.4 litre versions in 1989 after
a Pounds 200m investment programme, is also being developed in larger 1.6
and 1.8 litre versions for use respectively in the new Rover 400 family car
and MG sports car ranges to be launched next year.
Separately Rover expects to begin its first car assembly in East Europe in
spring next year with the start-up in Bulgaria of joint venture production
of its Maestro small family car range.
In Bulgaria, where Rover has formed a joint venture with the Sofia-based
Daru group, the UK carmaker expects to begin assembly of the ageing Maestro
at a plant at Varna on the Black Sea coast in the spring next year.
Output is expected to total 3,000 in 1995 and could rise in later years to
10,000 annually including exports to other east European markets.
Assembly in Bulgaria will be on the basis of SKD (semi-knocked down) kits
supplied from Rover's Cowley, Oxford plant. Painted bodies will be shipped
from Cowley to Varna for local final assembly, but Rover is aiming to
increase gradually the purchase of components in Bulgaria.
Production of the Maestro - launched in 1983 - for the UK market is expected
to cease by the end of the year. Rover investment in the project is expected
to total Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m.
Rover has taken a 51 per cent stake and management control in the joint
venture. Daru, which will hold 49 per cent and is already the local BMW
distributor, has also been appointed the distributor for Rover and Land
Rover vehicles in Bulgaria.
The two groups have put out to local tender contracts for the conversion and
refurbishment of a factory in Varna, which will be used for the Maestro
assembly.
The Rover group has taken several moves to internationalise it operations
this year. These include:
An agreement earlier this month to invest Pounds 10m in a new assembly
facility and sales and marketing organisation for Land Rover Discovery and
Defender models in South Africa with assembly taking place at an existing
BMW plant at Rosslyn, near Pretoria.
The production under licence in Brazil by Iochpe-Maxion of the Land Rover
300Tdi diesel engine.
Rover is also seeking to develop further a memorandum of understanding it
has signed with the Sipani group in India for the local assembly of the
Montego large family car and Rover's two-litre turbo-diesel engine.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Asia: Chinese officials lose a touch of luxury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chinese Communist party cadres learned at the weekend that life in the fast
lane would lose some of its allure as new regulations outlawed official use
of imported luxury cars such as Mercedes and Cadillacs.
According to a directive from the party's central committee, high-ranking
officials, including ministers and provincial governors, must ride in cars
made in China. The regulations stipulate that imported vehicles be replaced
by locally made models.
If the regulations are enforced, Chinese officials will be deprived of one
of their more cherished privileges. Like gold wrist-watches and expensive
fountain pens, an imported luxury limousine had become a coveted symbol of
advancement for status-conscious representatives of the proletariat.
No mention was made of any effect on top leadership figures, such as
politburo members, who travel in fleets of black Mercedes.
Apart from Mercedes, Cadillacs, and Lincoln Continentals, other favoured
foreign brands include BMW and Lexus. None of these marques is assembled in
China.
The central committee directive seems certain to hasten the scramble among
foreign automotive companies for the right to manufacture a luxury car in
China.
Frontrunners in negotiations now under way are thought to include General
Motors, which is offering a version of the Buick, Ford with its Lincoln, and
Toyota.
In the short-term, the new rules will benefit Volkswagen's Audi and Santana
models under manufacture in China. The Audi is widely used by middle-ranking
officials, but has not been regarded as entirely suitable for minister and
above.
China has been without a locally made luxury car since production stopped in
the 1980s of the Red Flag limousine, whose generous dimensions were such
that a meeting of the Politburo could be conducted in its capacious rear
compartment. Chinese officials these days would not be seen dead in a Red
Flag, which they regard as a bad advertisement for the modernising state.
Among those who might welcome the weekend edict are owners of luxury cars in
Hong Kong.
In the past few years there has been a lively trade in stolen vehicles
across the border into Guangdong province, where many have ended up in
official hands, including those of the security apparatus.
The security organs throughout China appear to be particularly well equipped
with luxury vehicles. In Beijing, black Mercedes with dark-tinted windows
are a favourite conveyance of high-ranking officials of the public security
bureau.
The new regulations follow last month's meeting of the central committee
which resolved to clean up the Communist party's image.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Middle East: Crackdown on Hamasraises stakes for Arafat -
The PLO leader's choices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Yassir Arafat's crackdown on the extremist Islamic Hamas group has saved
the Middle East peace process but has polarised Palestinian politics and
raised the prospect of internal Palestinian conflict.
Last week's kidnapping and death of an Israeli soldier during a raid by
Israeli forces on the kidnappers' hideout, starkly revealed the difficult
political choices facing the Palestinian leader. Mr Arafat must keep the
peace process going by conceding Israeli and western demands for a decisive
blow against Hamas, at least its military wing. However, this would risk
conflict or the possibility of continuing delays in the tortuous peace
negotiations which each day erode his popular support.
Israeli cabinet ministers yesterday praised Mr Arafat's arrests of up to 300
Hamas activists in Gaza and decision to disarm the militant organisation
which opposes peace with Israel.
The Israeli government, embarrassed by the fact that the kidnapped soldier
was being held in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and not, as they had
insisted, in Palestinian-controlled Gaza, said they would today lift the
closure imposed on Gaza after the kidnapping. The cabinet also said it would
resume suspended peace talks in Cairo tomorrow with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation.
Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said over the weekend that Israel
was satisfied with Mr Arafat's 'readiness to counteract the dangers of
Hamas'. However, Mr Arafat's moves against the underground movement has
divided Palestinian society. Hundreds of Hamas supporters, angry at the
continuing crackdown, rioted near a Jewish settlement in Gaza yesterday and
threw stones at Israeli police.
On Saturday, up to 1,500 Hamas supporters demonstrated outside the Gaza
central prison demanding the release of their activists. Palestinian police,
anticipating further protests, yesterday increased security across the
Strip. Weekend statements by Qassam, the military wing of Hamas, threatened
Israel with more kidnappings and Mr Arafat with bloodshed if he continued
his crackdown.
Hamas officials accused Mr Arafat of being the 'poodle' of Israel, of
carrying out 'Zionist' policy by proxy, and of passing information to Israel
about the location of the kidnappers. Hamas also blamed Mr Arafat for the
death of three of its gunmen in the raid on Friday. 'If these arrests
continue, Qassam brigades will reply by setting the Gaza Strip ablaze on the
heads of the Zionists and their lackeys,' one statement warned.
Despite Hamas threats of violence, both groups know they have more to lose
than gain from confrontation. Mr Arafat's aides have repeatedly warned that
the benefits of the peace process are still too few and limited to ensure
success of the pro-peace forces.
Furthermore, Hamas is believed to have at least 15-20 per cent bedrock
support in Gaza as well as a motivated and disciplined underground military
wing.
Hamas has built up an impressive social welfare network across the Gaza
Strip and West Bank, of schools, health clinics, the Islamic University in
Gaza and benevolent societies that continue to spread the doctrine of
Islamic values and build the organisation.
Hamas will be cautious to risk a conflict which could see its institutions
destroyed and leave it blamed by Palestinians for civil war. 'Hamas and the
PLO have to live together in Gaza,' said Mr Roni Shaked, a Hamas expert at
the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. 'Both of them know if they cross the red lines
they are going to destroy what they have achieved, because civil war inside
Gaza Strip means the end of everything, and probably the return of Israeli
occupation.'
But Mr Arafat must meet Israeli and western demands and strike a blow at
Hamas to keep the peace process going. He is clearly hoping to separate the
political wing of Hamas from the military wing, and has indicated he will
not release detainees associated with the Qassam brigades.
If his strategy pays off, and Hamas, concerned about the potential threat to
its institutions and convinced that eventually the tide of Islam will be
triumphant, allows him to curb Qassam, then the threat of widescale violence
could be avoided. In the long term, Mr Arafat knows the battle against Hamas
must be fought economically and culturally, alleviating the poverty and
sense of alienation which breed extremism.

FT  17 OCT 94 / International Press Review: Ceasefire in verbal war - Kuwait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN ALLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past 10 days, a ceasefire has broken out in the traditional rivalry
between Kuwait's three main Arabic dailies. The reason: for the second time
in four years, Iraq seemed to be threatening Kuwait's very existence.
The satirical wit of Kuwait's celebrated cartoonists was aimed at Saddam
Hussein rather than members of the government or rival factions of the
opposition; and the subtle barbs of laborious editorials, composed by
editors-in-chief who are often newspaper owners, were kept for those who
seemed to be slow in showing support for Kuwait.
All the dailies have run extra pages devoted to the crisis; the
English-language daily Arab Times broke all tradition by publishing on the
Friday weekend; while the owner of Al Qabas, which many regard as the
leading daily in both circulation and quality, outdid himself in devotion to
the cause, by voluntarily giving up the Crime Watch column. This is an
episodic discussion among Kuwaitis about the rising crime rate; hardly a
suitable talking point when attention needed to be focused on the chief
enemy in Baghdad.
However, Arabic newspaper editorials and opinion columns kept their place on
page one; a reminder that in Kuwait, as in many other Arab countries, those
in authority imagine their views on current affairs to be more important for
the reader than straight news.
Extraordinarily, in a country of just over 1m Arabic-speakers, Kuwait has
five daily Arabic papers, plus two Arabic weeklies and two English-language
dailies for the small minority of non-Arabic-speaking expatriates who would
want to read an English paper.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Middle East: US warns Iraq on new build-ups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Armed with a new United Nations resolution warning of 'serious consequences'
if Iraq once again menaces Kuwait, the US yesterday threatened immediate
military action for any repetition of this month's huge Iraqi troop build-up
near the Kuwaiti border.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the UN resolution, passed
unanimously by the Security Council late on Saturday night, put Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein 'on notice ..that he must not again threaten
Kuwait. If he does, we feel we have all the necessary authority to act
against him. I think next time we'll probably not wait,' Mr Christopher said
yesterday.
The US does not expect to start withdrawing the tens of thousands of troops
it has sent to Kuwait until several weeks after Iraq has completed the
reversal of its own troop build-up. US officials said they were still
watching two brigades near Nasiriyah, although the Iraqi troops appeared to
be moving in the right direction.
Washington is anxious not to have to perform the same costly troop
deployment all over again, weeks or months from now, if Iraq were to start
moving troops back towards its border with Kuwait. The passage of Saturday's
UN resolution followed a day of diplomatic wrangling in New York, as Russia
and France quarrelled with the tough language proposed by the US and UK.
Russia demanded the inclusion of language welcoming 'all diplomatic and
other efforts to resolve the crisis,' a reference to the mission of Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, to Baghdad.
Mr Kozyrev is due to meet Mr Christopher in New York today; Mr Tariq Aziz,
Iraq's deputy prime minister, was reported to be on his way to New York for
talks with Security Council members. The next review of sanctions will be on
November 14, which apparently is why Mr Aziz has decided to conduct yet
another lobbying campaign, this time with help from Mr Kozyrev.
In a communique issued by Iraq and Russia after Mr Kozyrev's visit to
Baghdad last week, Moscow promised to support an easing of the economic
sanctions imposed by the UN, while Iraq offered to recognise Kuwait's
borders and sovereignty. But the US remains adamant that Saddam should not
be rewarded for stepping back from the threat he mounted 10 days ago. It
continues to demand Iraq comply with the full list of UN resolutions against
it.
'Our goal is to have him comply with all UN resolutions, all of them,
including respect for ethnic minorities, including the return of Kuwaiti
prisoners,' Mr Christopher added. Arab diplomats say Mr Saddam is convinced
the US will never allow the lifting of sanctions so long as he holds power,
although he has never come close enough to compliance for this theory to be
tested. Any possibility of relaxing sanctions depends on Baghdad's
recognition of Kuwaiti independence.

FT  17 OCT 94 / International Press Review Tabloids find room to praise
heroism - Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tabloid journalism is increasingly a necessity in Iraq. Two of the country's
leading dailies, al-Jumhuriya and al-Qaddissiya, have both in the past few
months shrunk from broadsheet to tabloid format for want of newsprint in
sanctions-hit Baghdad. Gone are the sports pages and much of the local news
 -there is not a lot of advertising either.
But each of Iraq's main dailies yesterday, as all days, found plenty of room
to bash away at their favourite topics: the heroic wisdom of President
Saddam Hussein and the perfidious treachery of the west and above all, of
course, the US administration.
With extraordinary synchronisation, all the main dailies' photo editors
chose for the front pages a low-action shot of Mr Saddam sitting at the head
of a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council, Iraq's highest ruling
body.
'Arab and world resentment at heinous American campaign against Iraq,'
blazed al-Jumhuriya. 'Russians threaten to use veto at Security Council.'
'Washington prolongs the embargo to justify petroleum and financial
interests in the region,' roared al-Qaddissiya. 'President presides over
meeting of RCC,' said Babel, Iraq's newest tabloid, edited by Mr Saddam's
son, Uday, less blazingly.
Inside Iraq's dailies, the tone is as consistent as the photographs - one of
indignant self-righteousness laced with mockery. 'Any military officer or
analyst with a reasonable degree of insight,' intoned al-Thawra, the ruling
Baath Party newspaper, 'would be astonished at the biased American claim
that two divisions (of Iraqi troops) could attack Kuwait and occupy it,
since it is logistically impossible.'
In unison, all the papers hail Russia and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian
foreign minister, who takes to the UN this week proposals that Iraq
recognise Kuwait in exchange for some movement on the embargo - although
Iraq's papers fail anywhere to specify directly that Mr Saddam might
recognise Kuwait. Al-Jumhuriya speaks only, and typically, of 'protecting
the sovereignties and territories of the region's countries, whether Iraq or
Kuwait'.
So, 'Has a world coup taken place? Is the Iraqi victory nearing,' asked the
editor of al-Jumhuriya. Of course, yes: 'With the failure of the American
'TV game' in Iraq, the TV success which Clinton wanted to bolster his very
weak internal position has also fallen.' Mr Clinton, the successor of 'Bush
the famous criminal', and his regime are reported variously as 'sick',
'unstable' and even 'conniving with little pygmies'.
Sanction-weary Iraqis will remain sceptical. For most, it is the small
stories tucked away inside the papers which actually mean things.
Such as the story telling motorists who have lost their oil ration coupons
that they can now re-register. Or, on the back page of Babel, which has made
itself Iraq's campaigning paper, the list of the day's donors to the
newspaper's fund for the poor. Yesterday this included Ahmed Rathi and Laith
Hussein, two Iraqi soccer stars playing in Qatar, who each donated ID40,000.
Or, the despatch from Basra telling how prices of basic commodities fell
during the past few days as tensions lessened. A 50kg bag of sugar fell to
ID18,000 from ID25,000, while 50kg of flour fell from ID8,000 to ID7,000.

Moscow-backed opposition forces on Grozny overnight had been repulsed,
Itar-Tass news agency said. But sources within the frail coalition of

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas and YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, have been
discussing the formation of a joint venture to explore for hydrocarbons in
disputed South Atlantic waters. 'We would both like to form a long-term
partnership,' said Mr John Bueno, general manager of British Gas Argentina.
Such an alliance would, in addition to other projects, seek to explore
waters between Argentina and the Falkland Islands.
British Gas already has a big presence in Argentina with important stakes in
privatised gas distribution and power companies. But Mr Bueno stressed that
talks between the companies could go no further until the British and
Argentine governments had constructed the political framework within which
exploration could proceed. Although Argentina was defeated in the 1982 war
over the Falklands, it has not relinquished its claim over the islands,
ownership of which was recently enshrined in the constitution. Buenos Aires
disputes Britain's right unilaterally to exploit a non-renewable resource in
internationally disputed waters.

<TEXT>
The European Commission has used special powers to force through a directive
on liberalisation of satellite equipment and services throughout the EU. The
directive liberalises both establishment and operation of satellite
networks, as well as associated satellite dishes, across the EU. The
commission said the move would help businesses in retailing distribution and
the financial sector along with similar potential users who have
pan-European reqirements but limited means of exercising them. 'Due to
liberalisation, a 10-fold increase in the volume of satellite communications
before the year 2000 can be expected,' said the commission. The situation in
Europe contrasts sharply with the US, where an 'Open Skies' policy in the
early 1980s led to rapid stimulation of the satellite market.

<TEXT>
Italy's three main trade union federations have called for a mass
demonstration in Rome on November 19, following up Friday's general strike
to protest against proposed pension and welfare cuts. The unions also called
for a further eight hours of strikes between now and the middle of next
month. But most government ministers remained firmly committed to the 1995
budget, which looks to find savings and new revenues of L50,000bn (Pounds
20bn) to reduce next year's deficit.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, missed the general strike
because he was on an official visit to Russia, but at the weekend he
dismissed further industrial action as futile. 'The government has inherited
an economic situation with figures that no demonstration can alter,' he told
journalists in Moscow before returning to Italy. Friday's four-hour general
strike paralysed Italian cities and angry but peaceful demonstrations
attracted at least 3m people onto the streets, according to organisers.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Toy stores across the US will this week be removing toy guns from their
shelves, after a decision by some of the biggest retailers to stop selling
weapons that could be mistaken for the real thing. The move has been
prompted not by concerns that the sale of toy guns encourages violence, but
because of safety fears. With many young people in the US these days
carrying real guns, there is a danger that children carrying imitation
firearms could be seen as a threat. In two incidents in New York over the
past few weeks, youths brandishing toy guns have been shot by police who
thought the weapons were real. One of the boys, a 13-year-old, died.
Toys 'R' Us, the biggest US toy retailer, announced at the end of last week
that it would stop selling all look-alike toy guns including western-style
rifles and revolvers, plastic handguns and any weapons that could be
modified to look real. It was joined by Kay-Bee Toy Stores, another big toy
retailer, which said it would immediately start removing and destroying guns
that resembled military or police-style weapons.

Capital spending in China in July and August surged by more than 54 per cent
per cent compared with the same period last year, adding to continuing
worries about pressures on prices and an overheating economy. The State
Statistical Bureau reported that the 'overall scale of investment was still
inappropriate'. Fixed-asset investment in the first eight months far
exceeded the 25 per cent growth target for the year.
The bureau said that to August, investment by state enterprises, which
account for the bulk of capital spending, jumped by 44 per cent or Yn492.2bn
(Pounds 33bn). Coastal regions were reported to be the main culprits in
exceeding the capital-spending growth targets. The bureau's report accused
the prosperous east coast provinces of wilfully ignoring government
directives.

Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, got an enthusiastic welcome in
Beijing yesterday at the start of a brief visit to discuss increased Sino-US
defence co-operation. He is the first US defence chief to visit China since
before the Tiananmen killings of June 1989, when China's military turned its
guns on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's central square.
Mr Perry was greeted by General Chi Haotian, China's defence minister, and
other senior officers, including the deputy chief of the general staff of
the People's Liberation Army and the commander-in-chief of the navy. The
visit follows that of other senior US officials, including most recently Mr
Ron Brown, commerce secretary, who headed an investment mission.
These exchanges indicate a desire on both sides to upgrade a sometimes
fractious relationship. Among issues to be discussed are regional security,
arms control, defence conversion and peacekeeping activities. US officials
say there are no plans to lift sanctions on military sales to China imposed
after June 1989.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Haitians largely heeded the call of their returned president, Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, to relax and avoid violence in the wake of his return over the
weekend to Haiti after more than three years in exile.
President Aristide did his part to keep the peace by remaining in the
presidential palace on Sunday morning, skipping a mass he was scheduled to
attend.
The president's low profile was a victory for US security forces who are
afraid that numerous public appearances would make Mr Aristide an easy
target while simultaneously whipping his supporters into a fervour that
could get out of hand.
The president made a speech on Saturday inside a box of bullet-proof glass
and was never got within 100m of the general public. At the same time US
army vehicles circulated amongst the crowd playing anti-violence messages
through huge loudspeakers.
In the speech from the steps of the national palace to a crowd of fewer than
100,000, far less than organisers had expected, Mr Aristide pleaded with his
people to shun the violence that has torn this country apart for the past 3
years of military rule.
At one point he asked the crowd to take an oath against vengeance and for
reconciliation. The crowd reply affirmatively with a roaring 'yes.'
Mr Aristide's sway over much of the population, even among those who did not
attend the rally, was evident. 'Aristide told us to stay cool, so we are
going to stay cool. We love the man,' said Ms Dienla Paul as she walked to
church on Sunday morning.
Some are questioning how long the president, known for his love of mixing
with the people, can remain inside his box and still have his anti-violence
message remain effective beyond this honeymoon period.
Already there have been reports of at least three attacks on supporters of
the military coup in the countryside, where Mr Aristide's call may be more
faint and the US military presence is less forceful than in the capital.
The task of rebuilding the country's economy and spirit will nevertheless be
easier now that there is a government that can begin work.
'We have a few meetings scheduled for later this week,' said Lt Raymond
Kelly, head of the international police monitoring programme. 'The
government knows what needs to be done, it just has to move forward quickly
while everything is calm.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Crowning glory for the last of his line: Russia's harassed
president will meet Queen Elizabeth II today / A look at the royal visit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Queen Elizabeth meets Mr Boris Yeltsin, on her first state visit to
Russia which starts today, she will be greeting a man who is certainly the
last of his line. No future president of Russia will be a former member of
the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
Mr Yeltsin has fought hard to avoid the fate of being 'the Queen of
England', as the decorative presidency to which the former Supreme Soviet of
Russia wished to confine him was popularly known in Russian political
circles.
But in that struggle, which reached its climax a year ago, he exhausted
himself, unable now to muster the consistent energy needed to build
institutions of democracy. That leaves him occupying one of the most
powerful presidential chairs in the world without the appetite or will to
use its power in a way which will fully meet the challenges which press on
him.
From the Queen's point of view, the timing of the publication of Prince
Charles's authorised biography has cast an unfortunate shadow over the
beginning of her visit. That is not the only potential embarrassment. The
last Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II, and the Tsarina Alexandra, both close
relatives of the Queen's grandfather George V, were killed on Lenin's
personal orders.
Mr Yeltsin, in his Bolshevik period, levelled the house in Ekaterinburg
where the Tsar's family met their deaths, in order to remove its potential
as a shrine and presumably to advance his career.
The bodies were buried in roadside graves from which they were exhumed only
after the end of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics: they have not yet
been reburied, though are due to be, in the Peter and Paul Fortress in
Petersburg, which the Queen will visit.
The last Russian royal family is thus unlikely to come up as a subject of
conversation between the toasts.
Mr Charles Anson, the Queen's press secretary, said yesterday the issue had
been discussed at diplomatic level but 'the question of the reburial of the
Russian royal family and the Queen's visit are entirely separate issues'.
Though President Yeltsin has made at different times before different
audiences denunciations of communism and has apologised directly to the
Japanese for Soviet treatment of their prisoners of war, he has not alluded
publicly to the circumstances of the Tsar's death. Russia is not and perhaps
cannot be a penitent nation as Germany has been.
The British royal house also has a historical black spot which may inhibit
it from pressing the matter. King George V, a man who professed Nicholas II
to be a close friend as well as a relative and so like him physically as to
seem in photographs more a twin than a cousin, personally refused the Tsar's
family visas.
Professor Dominic Lieven, in his biography of Nicholas, says 'the King
 .took the lead in closing off the possibilities of asylum ..fearful of
reaction from British socialists and the labour movement, King George did
not want his dynasty to be associated in the public eye with the hated and
now fallen Russian Tsar, let alone with his half-English wife.'
Awkwardness of a different kind now attends Queen Elizabeth II as she, a
British monarch, comes to Russia for the first time. Still, the visit of
western Europe's most prominent constitutional monarch serves the purpose of
highlighting President Yeltsin's crowning achievement.
Like Mr Mikhail Gorbachev before him, he has realised, in what has been, for
both men, the greatest test of their erratic but high courage, that it is
not possible to take refuge for any length of time in the mailed fist.
The process which Mr Yeltsin inherited from Mr Gorbachev roars on; he rules
over it a little more than the Queen rules over her kingdom, but not much.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Big brother's Haiti blueprint: US efforts to create a
workable grovernment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TED BARDACKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As soon as Haiti's President, Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, stepped out of
a US military helicopter on to the grounds of his national palace, Mr Warren
Christopher, US secretary of state, was studying his every move.
The Americans have made a big investment, both political and financial, in
bringing Fr Aristide back to power, and now they want their dividend: a
stable Haiti.
That is why, on leaving Haiti late on Saturday, Mr Christopher stressed the
US would continue its military presence until the country was 'secure', and
President Aristide would be firmly pushed to bring his enemies into the
political process.
In the task of 'institution building', Haiti would receive important
guidance from the state department's Agency for International Development
(USAID).
As the US military's Haiti mission was ambiguous on arrival and largely
shaped by events on the ground, the US blueprint for creating democratic
institutions and ensuring development of a political centre that will hold
is in a constant state of revision. 'Developing policy in Haiti is like
going around a blind curve at 100mph,' says one USAID official . You simply
don't know what's next.'
Nevertheless, the central issues, culled from previous US experience in El
Salvador, Panama and South Africa, have largely been defined. The Aristide
government is being pressured to construct a wide political centre that
shuns mob violence and paramilitary terror, wrest judicial tasks away from
the army and police force, and build up other branches of government,
notably the legislature and municipalities.
Crucial to completing these tasks is finding the right mix of reconciliation
and justice. But here, US policy officials are divided. Some feel a Truth
Commission which would name those responsible for the estimated 5,000
murders under the military government but not prosecute them would be enough
to calm many of President Aristide's followers.
By doing this, President Aristide could quickly change himself from a
polarising force into a cohesive, healing figure, similar to the political
transformation undergone by his friend Nelson Mandela. But unlike the
anonymous death squads in El Salvador, Haiti's killers are well-known public
figures and President Aristide, without being specific, seems to be leaning
towards some form of prosecution.
'Aristide understands the need for reconciliation but not so far as to
establish impunity,' said a US official who believes if Haitians are ever to
believe in their justice system, they must be shown that it can produce
upright results.
Still, President Aristide may find that forgiveness is politically more
astute, given his need to cajole moderates into legitimate political
participation.
'In Haiti, you don't have a governing class, you have a ruling class,' says
Mr Rick Barton of the State Department's office of transition initiatives
(OTI). He says that for the political system to be inclusive, a broad
coalition willing to play by new and unfamiliar rules must be created, and
to do this, people must feel as if they are not under attack.
The centre-right is expected to be held in check by liberal economic reform
and what US officials hope will be a new prime minister from outside the
president's inner circle. The violent and extreme right has to deal with the
US military.
If a centre can be found and security ensured, then OTI's job of
demobilising those ousted from the military for human rights violations will
be easier. OTI is the brainchild of USAID head Mr Brian Atwood, who believes
the cycle of poverty and humanitarian assistance cannot be broken until
basic issues of governance are solved.
OTI will pay the salaries of former military and police officers for six
months and voluntarily relocate them to other parts of the country, where
their reputations are less of a threat to their own security. OTI teams will
ask local community leaders to nominate upstanding young people as new
members of Haiti's police force, who will then be trained by another state
department agency.
Interim budgets for local judges, to be autonomous from the military and
police force for the first time, is also part of USAID's financial
assistance package. Bringing in mentor judges from the nearby
French-speaking countries of Guadaloupe and Martinique is also being
considered. Much of the Americans' political development plans and budget
will go towards providing a check on President Aristide's power by
attempting to strengthen other areas of government.
Programmes for raising tax revenue on a local level will be implemented,
while the legislature is to be prodded into expanding the constitutional
authority of local governments. The goal is to restrain both a president on
the left and rural strongmen on the right.

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
All the main party leaders in Germany appeared to be celebrating last night,
although really only the former east German communists had good reason to do
so.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl appeared beaming with self-confidence in front of his
Christian Democratic Union party workers, declaring his wafer-thin majority,
and the party's worst vote since 1949, a victory.
The CDU and its Bavaria-based sister party, the Christian Social Union,
remains the biggest single group in the Bundestag, but government will be
difficult.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democratic party (SPD) leader, has failed to
dislodge Mr Kohl from his office.
But he was able to cheer a 3 percentage-point improvement in the party's
score, to around 37 per cent of the vote.
He denounced the Kohl coalition as 'a coalition of losers', although he had
failed to win.
As for Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and leader of the Free
Democratic party (FDP), anyone might have thought he had won, as he burst,
confetti-covered, into his party headquarters.
'We have made it, and I am happy,' he said. 'It was incredibly difficult to
get there.' What he meant was, getting back into the Bundestag at all. For
the FDP had lost ground from 11 per cent of the vote last time to around 7
per cent yesterday, seeing its representation slump by 30 seats to under 50
in the 656-member parliament.
In the other three state elections yesterday - in the Saarland,
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Thuringia - the FDP failed to cross the 5 per
cent hurdle needed to get into the state parliaments. But it managed it in
the federal parliament, which means that Mr Kohl's coalition can just
survive.
The man who really had cause to celebrate, however, was Mr Gregor Gysi, the
parliamentary leader of the PDS, the Party of Democratic Socialism, based on
the old communist party of East Germany.
For according to mid-evening predictions, he and his colleagues were set to
win four seats in east Berlin outright on the first vote, giving the party
the right to full parliamentary representation of around 27 seats.
'It would have been good if we could have forced a change of government,' he
said. 'But for the PDS, this was an historic achievement, because we did it
against the opposition of all the other parties.'
The PDS is also left holding the balance of power in both the east German
states which voted last night.
According to the latest projections, the party polled 23.2 per cent in
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, against 38.9 per cent for the CDU and 27.8 per cent
for the SPD.
That means that the two big parties will have to form a coalition, unless
the SPD does a deal - against everything the party leadership has promised -
with the PDS.
In Thuringia, the PDS was forecast at 17.5 per cent, against 43.2 per cent
for the CDU and SPD 28.9 per cent.
Neither the FDP nor the Greens managed to gain 5 per cent, leaving the PDS
again controlling the balance of power.
The one party which suffered a complete defeat was the far-right
Republicans, who looked unlikely to gain even 2 per cent of the vote,
leading most political commentators to predict a total eclipse of the coming
years.
The support of the PDS remains overwhelmingly in east Germany, where the
party was forecast last night to win some 19.2 per cent of the vote, against
just 0.9 per cent in west Germany.
The largest party in the east remains Mr Kohl's CDU, with a predicted 39.7
per cent, while the SPD was expected to win 31.5 per cent.
In the Saarland, the third state to vote yesterday, Mr Oskar Lafontaine of
the SPD narrowly retained his overall majority but saw a drop to around 50.1
per cent of the vote, compared with over 54 per cent four years ago.
Yet again, the FDP failed to get into the state parliament, although the
Greens were on the verge of doing so, with 4.9 per cent.

FT  17 OCT 94 / German Elections: Kohl victory a reassurance for markets -
Relief at verdict on FDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of victory, although narrow, for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
conservative coalition in yesterday's German general election, was welcomed
last night by economists and is expected to remove an element of uncertainty
from financial markets. Both the bond and stock markets have swung from
pessimism about the possibility of an opposition victory to optimism and
gains last week as polls showed Mr Kohl's government was likely to be
re-elected. Although Mr Kohl's majority was expected to be wafer-thin, there
was relief that the Free Democrats (FDP), the junior coalition party, had
succeeded in re-entering the Bonn parliament after failing in recent state
elections.
Because a victory for Mr Kohl, head of the Christian Democratic party (CDU),
had been discounted in financial markets, economists did not expect bond and
equity markets to show further gains today.
Mr Kermit Schoenholtz, senior economist at Salomon Brothers International in
London, said that, if expectations of a Kohl victory were borne out, the
effect on markets would be rather modest. 'I would not be surprised to see
the initial reaction rather muted,' agreed Mr Richard Reid, Frankfurt-based
economist with UBS Global Research. Noting that bond markets had been
affected by concern over global inflation, he said Mr Kohl's likely victory
had now removed any extra worries over political stability in Germany.
'This has got to be good for bonds and stocks,' he added. Even though the
majority of the Bonn coalition, also including the Christian Social Union
(CSU) of Bavaria, looked thin, he said: 'These coalitions tend to work very
closely.'
He thought, too, the election result should make easier the Bundesbank's job
of controlling the money supply and inflation. 'It removes a big question
mark.' Ever since unification in 1990, the year of the last general
election, the central bank has been concerned about the impact on prices of
the high public spending needed to rebuild the east German economy.
Despite the coalition's apparent victory over the Social Democrats (SPD), Ms
Alison Cottrell, international economist at Kidder Peabody's London
operation, noted 'it's going to be a very splintered parliament'. The Greens
won more seats and the east German-based Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS)
looked likely to benefit from discontent in the east.
Thus she thought that, while markets would react favourably to last night's
result, investors and traders might consider Mr Kohl's freedom of manoeuvre
 -especially in fiscal policy - to be more limited.
As for the Bundesbank, she said the reaction there might be one of caution.
If budgetary and tax packages, needed to continue paying the high cost of
German integration, took too long to get through parliament, 'the Bundesbank
might flex its muscles'. But this did not mean it would immediately put
interest rates up.
Mr Schoenholtz thought the central bank could take comfort from steady
economic growth which did need not need the aid of lower interest rates.

It was all over in a second. An empty blue television screen, then a pie
chart. First the two big parties and then yells and cheering of the sort
reserved for football terraces: the Free Democratic party had made it back
into parliament.
People threw themselves into each other's arms, managing only just to keep
their drinks in their glasses. The first exit poll showed the FDP had won 7
per cent, 4 per cent less than in 1990 but enough to get its representatives
back into the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.
For the first time in years it was a close shave for the party, which has
only once scored more than 12 per cent.
In recent weeks polls had shown FDP support slipping steadily. One poll even
gave the party 4 per cent, a result which would have left it outside the
federal parliament for the first time since the second world war.
The party lost out in five state elections this year and also lost its seats
in the European parliament. Many people who had previously voted FDP now
wondered whether there was any point: the liberals had moved too close to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, they said, and given up
the civil rights and free market economics they once stood for.
Even as Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and FDP leader, pushed his way
through a forest of cameras, some party members warned that the bad result
meant his days as party leader were numbered.
'This is a very poor result for the party leadership,' said Mr Tobias
Gartner, a 21-year-old who runs the Young Liberals in the northern state of
Schleswig-Holstein. 'I've met (Kinkel). He's very nice. . . but he's no good
for the job of party leader. He's a civil servant. He doesn't have what it
takes.'
At Berlin's Congress Hall, meanwhile, the Party of Democratic Socialism was
holding its election party. 'We voted for the PDS because we want them to be
the voice of the east Germans in the Bundestag,' said Karin Neubert.
The hall was awash with posters of Mr Gregor Gysi, the charismatic
parliamentary leader of the PDS, with his recognisable round silver rimmed
spectacles.
The shouts went up whenever fresh exit polls came in. The PDS had succeeded
where the other parties failed.
It relied on a loyal and large grassroots organisation whose members are
known locally. It tapped the vote of former Communist party members, many of
whom were dismissed from their jobs after unification and who now feel
marginalised. It managed to act as a protest party for the unemployed. Above
all, it acted as the party which could represent the voice and interests of
the east Germans.
Mr Gysi frequently referred to the free and widespread kindergarten system,
holiday camps for children, and the sense of solidarity among people under
the communist system, all of which virtually disappeared after unification.
The unique act of combining a sense of nostalgia for the past with providing
some sense of east German identity won over the voters, even the younger
generation.
Indeed, like the other former communist parties in eastern Europe, the PDS
represents one of the phases in the transition from a communist to a post
communist culture.
The PDS, however, was undoubtedly helped by the campaign run by Chancellor
Kohl's governing Christian Democrats, who repeatedly accused the PDS and its
supporters of being fascists painted red. 'It played right into our hands.
It was free advertising. It made east Germans, many of whom never supported
either the former communists, or even the PDS, swing over to us,' said Mr
Lothar Bisky, leader of the PDS.
The other success of the PDS was the weakness of the Social Democrats, which
failed to establish itself as a left-wing party both in east Berlin and
throughout eastern Germany, as well as the other political parties.

Berliners, attracted out by the sunshine, strolled along Unter den Linden,
the old city's main street, and through the Brandenburg Gate towards the
Tiergarten, the huge central park. Teenagers played football by the side of
the Reichstag, the Prussian parliament which Hitler had tried to burn down
and which will be the new home of the Bundestag's (lower house of
parliament) when the government moves to the capital.
'This is really an important day,' said 71-year-old Mrs Hilda R, who
declined to give her full family name. 'I've lived all my life in the
eastern part of the city. Through good times and bad. I voted against that
Hitler. And I am going to vote for the PDS (the party of Democratic
Socialism, heirs to east Germany's former commu nist party) today.'
She said her husband would vote for the PDS as well, even though both
admitted they had since unification received generous pensions from Mr
Helmut Kohl. 'Don't get me wrong. I was never in the east German Communist
party. It's just that the PDS are local east Berliners.'
Ms Barbara Jahn lives in Prenzlauer Berg, east Berlin, one of the three
seats the PDS was trying desperately to win to ensure it would be
represented in the Bundestag, or Lower House. The constituency, home to many
of east Berlin's intellectuals, boasts long, tree-lined streets and
turn-of-the-century houses, whose elegance has given way to neglect and
disrepair.
It is also home to the PDS's candidate, Mr Stefan Heym, the 81-year-old
writer and one of east Germany's best-known authors during the communist
period.
'I was so excited,' said Ms Jahn, a 20-year-old computer programmer trainee.
'This was my first time to vote in a federal election. I voted for the PDS,
and I gave both my votes to them.'
Scores of young and old people walked along the tree-lined Knackstrasse on
their way to vote in the local school. 'I gave my first vote for the PDS and
the second for the Greens,' said Mr Robert Schwarz, a 43-year-old bank
official. His wife looked at him, with a slightly disapproving frown. 'I
voted for the SPD. No buts here. Wolfgang Thierse (the SPD's candidate) is a
good man,' said Mrs Schwarz.
The pensioners, however, appeared divided. 'Helmut Kohl has been good to
me,' said Mr Wilhelm Klein. 'I am 56 years old. I went into pension early.
Kohl has given me a good income. I can't rely on the SPD to be so generous.
As for the PDS, forget it.' His wife shook her head. 'I voted for the PDS,'
she said.
Beyond the other side of the Tiergarten, along Nollendorf Platz in the
western part of the city, many young people had only contempt for the PDS.
Sipping their coffee outside one of the several cafes on Maassenstrasse,
they were trying to decide whether to use their two votes for the SPD, or at
least one for the Greens.
'We have to get Kohl out, and keep the communists out as well,' said
Andreas, a waiter. 'I want a change. But (Rudolf) Scharping (leader of the
SPD) is so boring. What can I do? I am not convinced the SPD will make it.'
Gaby Beyer agreed. 'I can't understand why those east Berliners were voting
for the PDS. And we paid all that extra tax for unification] Huh. If the SPD
wins, we'll have to pay more tax. But what can I do? I always voted SPD.
Maybe I'll switch to the Greens.'

FT  17 OCT 94 / Personal rivalries hamper Slovak struggle to form a
coalition: Meciar is finding it difficult to attract political partners
Boland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VINCENT BOLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two weeks after its first general election as an independent country,
Slovakia's byzantine political scene has yet to yield a new government.
Coalition talks among the seven parties that won seats in parliament have
foundered over long-standing personality rivalries concerning the country's
president, Mr Michal Kovac.
Mr Vladimir Meciar, whose party got most seats in the election on September
30 and October 1, is almost certain to become the country's prime minister
for a third time. His Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has 61 seats
in the 150-member Slovak national council, more than three times as many as
its nearest rival.
But so far it has failed to attract any coalition partners. Talks between
HZDS and the moderate Christian Democrats (KDH), which won 17 seats, have
stalled, despite Mr Meciar's offer of the foreign affairs and transport
ministries.
Negotiations with the second biggest party, the Democratic Left (SDL), which
consists mainly of former communists, are also in limbo. Ms Brigita
Schmognerova, a deputy prime minister in the outgoing government
representing the SDL, says the party is 'still open' to joining with HZDS
but that 'the personality of Mr Meciar is a problem'.
Analysts say the biggest obstacle to an HZDS-led coalition is the party's
threat to remove President Kovac from office. He was instrumental in ousting
Mr Meciar as prime minister in March, amid allegations that the HZDS leader
was 'abusing' the privatisation process.
Mr Meciar has not forgotten the insult, and in his campaign speeches he
vowed revenge. But Mr Kovac retains strong support among moderate Slovak
parties.
HZDS could form a government immediately by entering a coalition with the
extreme right-wing Slovak National Party and governing with the support of
the socialist Union of Slovak Workers. The three parties have a combined 83
seats.
If no agreement can be reached between HZDS and more mainstream parties,
such a coalition is likely to assume office, ushering in a period of
instability.
If, as seems likely, HZDS dominates the new government, it will seek to
retain control of key ministries, such as finance and privatisation. This
could result in a major shift in privatisation policy, a central plank of
the outgoing administration's economic reforms. The departing prime
minister, Mr Jozef Moravcik, revived voucher privatisation, in which Slovak
citizens buy coupons they can exchange for shares in state companies. Over
1m Slovaks have registered to take part in the programme.
Senior HZDS officials have indicated the programme would be curtailed if the
party came to power, with many enterprises scheduled for sell-off staying in
state hands.
Any government's room for manoeuvre in reshaping economic policy is limited.
It will have to abide by tight constraints on public spending imposed in
July by the International Monetary Fund in return for a Dollars 168m (Pounds
112m) standby loan. This will leave little scope for wage rises or higher
pensions, which Mr Meciar promised during the election campaign. 'Whatever
the new government, it will want to retain its access to international
capital markets,' says a western economic adviser in Bratislava.
This is why foreign investors are sanguine about Slovakia's economic
potential, despite the political uncertainty. In a report on the country in
August, ING Securities urged investors to 'look beyond the rhetoric' of
politicians and focus on economic realities. 'We are fundamentally positive
towards Slovakia,' says Mr Jean-Christophe Ganz, manager of ING Bank's
branch in Bratislava.
Slovakia's gross domestic product has expanded 4.4 per cent in the first
half of 1994, reversing four years of decline. Foreign reserves have climbed
from Dollars 415.3m at the end of 1993 to Dollars 1.38bn on September 28;
inflation is down from an annual 16.4 per cent in January to 13.5 per cent
in July. Unemployment remains high at 14.5 per cent.
If things begin to go wrong for the new government there is concern it might
seek scapegoats among Slovakia's 560,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority.
Though they have 17 seats in parliament, ethnic Hungarians remain outside
the political mainstream. It is to areas such as this, as much as to his
attitude to investors, that observers will look for evidence that Mr Meciar
has learned lessons from his short break in Slovakia's political wilderness.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Corruption allegations against French Government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Rossi, general secretary of France's Republican party, was yesterday
appointed minister for trade and industry in the country's centre-right
government, replacing Mr Gerard Longuet who resigned on Friday following
growing allegations of corruption, writes John Ridding.
The swift appointment and the decision not to implement a broader cabinet
reshuffle, reflect Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's attempt to limit the
upheaval in his government, with presidential elections little more than six
months away.
Mr Balladur is trying to play down the effects of the corruption scandals
that have rocked the administration and which have prompted the resignation
of two cabinet ministers in the past three months.

FT  17 OCT 94 / German Elections: Kohl to tread carefully on deepening EU -
The pivotal position held by the chancellor within Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The narrowness of his razor-edge election victory last night still leaves
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl holding a pivotal position on the European
stage during the next four years. Mr Kohl has assiduously promoted the
strategy of carrying out German unification in tandem with the unification
of Europe. Awarded now with a mandate for a fourth successive term, he will
play a vital part in preparing the 1996 intergovernmental treaty to revise
the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Kohl has never left any doubt of his vision that a united Germany has to
be embedded in a solid framework of European co-operation. However, public
support among the German electorate for deepening integration in the present
European Union has fallen during the past four years.
The narrowness of the Bonn coalition's majority may add to the chancellor's
domestic reasons for caution over further extending supranational European
decision-making - particularly over the question of economic and monetary
union (Emu). In view of the potential conflicts between the goals of
intensifying EU integration among the present 12 members and extending the
Union to eastern Europe, Mr Kohl will need to tread a narrow path between
'deepening' and 'widening' the Union.
The fragmentation of the popular vote - the score of the Christian Democrats
and the Christian Social Union yesterday was the lowest since the first
post-war western elections in 1949 - was reflected particularly in the
strong showing by the reformed Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the
former communists. Voters in east Germany have been particularly reticent to
espouse the ideal of deepening western European integration, and have shown
more mistrust than the west Germans about the goals of economic and monetary
union.
The need to take into account east German feelings on this issue, and also
to maintain large-scale financial help for east German industrial
enterprises and agriculture, will almost certainly run counter to the free
market policies traditionally upheld by the Free Democrats, junior partner
in the Bonn coalition.
However, the FDP's profile in Bonn has been falling during the last few
years, and the party may experience difficulties in turning its tally of
seats into political muscle.
Opinion polls during the last two years indicate that the German electorate
now gives greater support to enlarging the EU than to further intensifying
links among the 12 present members.
Last night's Yes to EU membership in Finland followed Austria's approval of
adherence to the Union in its referendum four months ago. The Finnish vote
brings a step nearer reality the plan for four members of the European Free
Trade Association to join the EU in the New Year - a move that will add
momentum to the membership ambitions of Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic
and Slovakia.
Mr Kohl now has a chance of exceeding former West German Chancellor Konrad
Adenauer's record 14 years in power. If he serves out the coming four-year
legislative period, he would also become the longest-serving head of
government in any European Community country since the war. The record for a
run of successive years in office is at present held by Mr Pierre Werner,
Luxembourg's prime minister between 1959 and 1974.
Mr Kohl's international status has been amplified by the departure of most
of his fellow European heads of government who agreed the Maastricht treaty
in December 1991.
Following the scheduled departures of President Francois Mitterrand next
spring and Luxembourg's Mr Jacques Santer, who becomes European Commission
president in January, by next summer only four of the 12 leaders who gave
their blessing to the treaty are likely still to be in office. Apart from Mr
Kohl, they are Mr Felipe Gonzalez of Spain, Portugal's Mr Anibal Cavaco
Silva and Britain's Mr John Major.
With Mr Kohl confirmed in power in Bonn, the path Europe takes will depend
crucially on the outcome of the French presidential election due to be held
next May to decide Mr Mitterrand's successor. If Mr Jacques Delors, the
Socialist president of the European Commission and a redoubtable supporter
of a federal Europe, takes over in the Elysee Palace, he and Mr Kohl will be
able to extend close co-operation built up during Mr Delors' 10 years in
Brussels.
However, even Mr Delors has recently been quoted as saying that the
Maastricht treaty was poorly drafted and over-ambitious. If the new French
president comes from the political right - either Mr Edouard Balladur, the
present prime minister, or Mr Jacques Chirac, the leader of the French
neo-Gaullist party - France's European policies might take a more
nationalistic turn. That would constrain the chances of solid Franco-German
co-operation during the period leading up to the 1996 conference.
The main possible source of upset on the road towards further European
integration concerns Emu. Many German voters remain wary of the plan for
economic and monetary union by 1999 set down by the Maastricht treaty, a
step that would mean the eventual disappearance of the D-Mark and its
replacement by a single European currency.
Mr Kohl said in an interview at the end of last month with four European
newspapers that the timetable was not 'basically' up for discussion -
indicating that, under certain circumstances, it might be.
During preparations for the 1996 conference, Mr Kohl seems likely to revive
the German demand, made originally in 1991, for monetary union to be
accompanied by full-scale European political union. However, moving towards
a full-scale 'federal' Europe could be stymied not only by objections from
Britain and France but by reticence among the German electorate about
further transfer of powers to EU institutions.
For many years up to 1993, Mr Kohl was a fervent supporter of the goal of a
'United States of Europe'. However, last year he said he would no longer use
the phrase on the grounds that it might be 'misunderstood' - a move spurred
by opinion polls in Germany during the past two years showing growing
opposition to a federally organised Europe.
Three years ago, Mr Kohl was brimming with optimism that economic and
monetary union would be a reality by 1997. However, during the last two
years his public statements on the subject have become far more circumspect.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, has considerably influenced Mr
Kohl's monetary union thinking. Mr Tietmeyer underlined the central bank's
misgivings over the Emu plan last month by saying the Maastricht timetable
set down nothing more concrete than a 'planning target' and a 'vision'.
If the next German general election is held on schedule in four years' time,
the question of the future of the D-Mark will loom much larger than it does
now. According to the Maastricht treaty, the final date for monetary union
is set as January 1 1999, just a few weeks after the 1998 elections - a
coincidence of the calendar that could cause Mr Kohl or his successor
considerable headaches.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Corruption rocks French ship of state: Resignations have
holed Balladur's government and ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Announcing his resignation at his prime minister's Matignon office on Friday
evening, Mr Gerard Longuet, the industry minister, described himself as calm
and serene. He claimed he could now counter allegations of corruption
concerning the financing of his Saint Tropez villa and a separate probe into
the funding of his Republican party.
For Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, however, it is difficult to be
so sanguine. Mr Longuet leaves a government badly shaken by corruption
investigations which are threatening Mr Balladur's presidential aspirations
and which have prompted comparisons with Italy's 'clean hands' anti-graft
campaign.
Mr Longuet's departure compounds the blow sustained by the government a few
days earlier when Mr Alain Carignon, the former communications minister, was
detained in a Lyon jail. Mr Carignon had resigned in July after being
accused by an investigating magistrate of receiving illicit payments in
return for the award of public works contract in Grenoble, where he is
mayor.
Although less dramatic, Mr Longuet's resignation is more significant. A
heavyweight in France's centre-right administration, the industry minister
is the most senior figure yet ensnared by the corruption probes which are
rocking French politics and business. His departure represents a landmark in
the investigations and demonstrates the increased vulnerability of French
establishment figures.
For Mr Balladur, the events of the past week add up to his most serious
challenge since his centre-right administration took office last year. In
addition to the damage wrought by two ministerial resignations, his personal
ambitions have been undermined.
With his eyes set on next spring's presidential elections, the French prime
minister looked to Mr Longuet as a vital ally in his battle with his
Gaullist rival, Mr Jacques Chirac, for the conservative candidacy in the
forthcoming polls.
The French prime minister now finds his strategy and his standing
undermined. 'It is no longer a question of cracks but of gaping holes in the
Balladur system,' said Liberation, the daily newspaper, in an editorial.
The risk is that the corruption affairs affecting his government may not be
so easily tamed. A report into the finances of the Republican party by Mr
Reynaud Van Ruymbeke, an investigating magistrate, could drag other senior
party figures into the firing line, including Mr Francois Leotard, the
defence minister, and Mr Alain Madelin, minister for economic development
and small businesses.
Of broader concern, are the growing wave of probes which have seen the
chairmen of some of France's largest business groups, from Saint Gobain, the
glass and building materials company, to Alcatel Alsthom, the transport,
telecoms and engineering concern, placed under investigation for alleged
corruption.  The cases have ensured that corruption will be a central theme
in the presidential polls and have fuelled pressure for an Italian-style
'clean hands' operation.
Mr Balladur, along with other senior politicians and businessmen, deny that
corruption is endemic in France and reject the comparison with Italy. He
argues that the spate of investigations reflects a freer hand enjoyed by the
judiciary in pursuing cases which mostly date back to the 1980s.
Despite his initial claims that the existing legislation will resolve the
problem, Mr Balladur has bowed to mounting pressure and proposed a
strengthening of safeguards against corruption. He is calling for a panel to
perform an annual audit of the assets of ministers, MPs and senior local
officials. He also proposed that prefects, the chief government
representatives in the regions, be empowered to suspend suspect public works
contracts.
For some, however, such proposals do not go far enough. Mr Thierry
Jean-Pierre, an investigating magistrate, and now a Euro-MP, demands
increased resources for magistrates investigating political and white collar
corruption. He says failure to act swiftly against corruption will push
France down the road to 'Italianisation', undermining political institutions
and playing into the hands of demagogues such as Jean-Marie le Pen, leader
of the extreme right National Front.
Such an analysis, is itself, extreme. But the rising wave of corruption
probes have already rocked the French ship of state. Mr Balladur has yet to
show that he can steer it back on course.

<TEXT>
Mr Jose Rossi, general secretary of France's Republican party, was yesterday
appointed minister for trade and industry in the country's centre-right
government, replacing Mr Gerard Longuet who resigned on Friday following
growing allegations of corruption.
The swift appointment and the decision not to implement a broader cabinet
reshuffle, reflect Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's attempt to limit the
upheaval in his government with presidential elections little more than six
months away.
Mr Balladur is seeking to play down the effects of the corruption scandals
that have rocked the administration and which have prompted the resignation
of two cabinet ministers in the past three months.
The appointment of Mr Rossi enables Mr Balladur to maintain the balance
between the various parties in the ruling RPR-UDF coalition. The Republican
party, which is still headed by Mr Longuet, is the largest element of the
UDF.
Mr Rossi, 50, is thought to be to the right of the Republican party and is
considered a potential supporter of Mr Balladur in his undeclared contest
with Gaullist rival Mr Jacques Chirac for the conservative candidacy in next
year's presidential election.
The new minister will inherit a broad and sensitive brief. In addition to
trade and industry, the position also covers postal services and
telecommunications.
Mr Rossi will be presented with some important projects not completed at the
time of Mr Longuet's resignation. These include the search for industrial
partners for Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer manufacturer. Mr Longuet
was also pushing for reform of the legal status of France Telecom, which
would allow the exchange of equity investments with other international
telecoms operators.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Against the sombre backdrop of high unemployment, there are a few Europeans
for whom job offers are overflowing: Finnish Portuguese speakers, Greeks
able to translate complex documents into Norwegian, not to mention Spanish
natives well versed in Swedish.
As Brussels prepares to open its arms to Norway, Sweden, Finland and
Austria, the language services of the European Commission, parliament and
council of ministers, are busily recruiting interpreters for the extra
languages the newcomers will bring to European proceedings.
The cost of expanding the already elaborate language services has caused
consternation in certain quarters. One speculation is that the total number
of language combinations necessary at any official meeting will rise from 72
to 132; new booths will have to be built to house the translators, and the
mound of printed translations will topple over.
Conservative MEP James Elles believes the EU's commitment to translate
official documents into all nine, soon 12, languages, and to provide
comprehensive translations at official meetings is unrealistic, and a drain
on the public purse.
'Can we really assume that all documents and all meetings can be covered in
all the necessary languages? Why is it that an international institution
such as the EU needs to have every single document in every single language
when the United Nations and the Council of Europe seem able to operate with
only a few?' he asks.
Mr Elles, says the commission, exaggerates. First, the translation service
commonly uses a 'pivot' system for simultaneous translations. This means
that a central interpreter translates from the less well-known languages,
such as Danish, into a commonly-used one such as French or English, from
which other interpreters then translate into, for example, Portuguese.
'You don't have to have someone in the Danish booth who can translate into
Portuguese or Greek,' said a commission official. 'The system is not
perfect, as it slows down the rate of translation, but it does reduce the
number of language combinations.'
Second, at least as far as the commission is concerned, officials take a
pragmatic approach to which language they use for everyday business. 'The
parliament, for all the usual democratic reasons, has to work in all the
languages of the member states, whereas the commission just gets on with
things in the three official languages: French, German and English,' said an
official.
As for documents, 'we are reinforcing our language teams in order to produce
documents in the final language, but that is an obligation to the outside
world.'
All this, says the commission, creates the need for about 400 extra language
posts. A far more pressing problem is finding jobs at all levels of the
commission for civil servants from the new member states.
Estimates suggest that room needs to be found for about 1,300-1,700 Finns,
Swedes, Austrians and Norwegians. In the past, space was created by offering
golden handshakes to existing staff, but Mr Karel Van Miert, commissioner
responsible for personnel issues, has ruled out this approach as too
expensive.
Demographic factors could, however, come to his rescue. 'The commission was
set up in the 1960s, so people who joined then in their 30s are now
retiring,' pointed out an official. 'If you allow for a lengthy transition
period, we should be able to absorb the newcomers fairly easily.'
But this approach creates a new problem; it will stop virtually all
recruitment of existing member states for four to five years, something
which certain countries, notably Spain and the UK who are under represented
at the commission, may be unwilling to accept.
Meanwhile, tension over language in the Commission press room is rising,
with non-French speaking journalists increasingly unhappy about the
obligatory use of French at the midday briefings, for which no translation
is provided.
Many non-French-speaking journalists do not understand the proceedings and
have to put questions in faltering French to English-speaking spokesmen and
women, who are obliged to answer in French.
'Je veux demander une question sur les bent bananes,' is not untypical of
the type of mangled questions asked. With the arrival of the three Nordic
countries and Austria, the case for providing an English translation in the
press room is strengthening. Last week journalists voted in favour of such a
move. Their wish, however, may not be granted. Commission officials fear
that allowing in English means allowing in German, and Italian and Spanish
and so on. This, they say, would be too expensive.
Further, Mr Jacques Delors, it is said, does not want to go down in history
as the French president of the Community who allowed English into the press
room.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Finns vote 'Yes' to EU in first of Nordic ballots

Finland voted yesterday to join the European Union in the first of three
Nordic ballots that could enlarge membership of the EU from 12 to 16.
The result, showing a Yes victory by 53 per cent to 47 per cent, was
welcomed by Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister. The turnout of 74 per cent was
slightly higher than the turnout in the last general election.
However, the margin was less than pro-EU supporters had hoped for, and fell
below Austria's Yes vote of more than 66 per cent in June.
In Brussels, Mr Hans van den Broek, the EU commissioner for external
affairs, said he hoped the referendum result would help win a Yes vote in
Sweden and Norway.
In both those countries opposition to membership has been much stronger than
in Finland and Austria.
The Social Democratic leadership in Sweden and the Labour party government
in Norway looked to Finland for added momentum to their campaigns for a Yes
vote. The Finnish vote was scheduled first in the hope of achieving a Nordic
domino effect.
In Sweden, which votes on November 13, most polls have shown a slight but
unsteady lead for the Yes side since the summer. In Norway, where the
referendum is on November 28, the No camp holds a solid lead.
But a weekend opinion poll for the first time showed a clear majority for
membership based on a Yes in both Finland and Sweden. The poll showed 46 per
cent in favour to 41 per cent against - a turnaround from last month when
the same poll showed a No lead of 47 per cent against 39 per cent.
The majority of Finland's political establishment and business leaders
argued that membership would underpin the Finnish economy, which this year
has started to recover from a crippling recession that saw output shrink by
13 per cent between 1991 and 1994 and unemployment rise to almost 20 per
cent of the workforce. Finland's parliament must ratify yesterday's
referendum result by a two-thirds majority before the country can join the
Union as planned on January 1 next year, but this is not expected to prove
an obstacle.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Kohl claims narrow poll victory: German ruling parties
likely to hold power with 4-seat majority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl claimed a narrow victory in the German election last
night, but looked set to rule with a wafer-thin majority in the German
Bundestag, the lower house of parliament.
Late computer projections based on partial results indicated an overall
majority of four seats for the present conservative-liberal coalition over
the combined forces of the left.
The outcome could leave Mr Kohl with an uncomfortable and potentially
unstable coalition. However, he seemed determined last night to stay with
his partner, the minority Free Democratic party (FDP) headed by foreign
minister Mr Klaus Kinkel, in spite of its poor showing at the polls, rather
than form a grand coalition with the Social Democratic party (SPD).
The key to the narrow result was the success of the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS), the reformed East German communist party, which looked set
to win four direct seats in east Berlin, and therefore a likely 29 seats in
the Bundestag under the complicated electoral rules.
According to the projections, Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its
Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, will remain the largest
group in the Bundestag, with 284 seats. The FDP will have 46 seats, giving a
combined 330 for the coalition.
The SPD, the main opposition party, was set to win 249 seats, while the
Greens looked likely to win 48. With the 29 PDS seats, that would give 326
for the opposition as a whole.
'It may be difficult, but so is life,' Mr Kohl said as the outcome became
increasingly clear. 'It is still a perfectly good working majority. Why
should I not be satisfied? I can still carry on governing.' The projected
victory for Mr Kohl, 64, would give him his fourth successive term as
chancellor.
Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, claimed the result was a vindication
for his campaign, in spite of his failure to defeat the government. He
warned that the coalition might well not last its full four-year term.
He appeared to concede defeat, saying the coalition had a majority of 'one,
two or three'.
'It has been very narrowly endorsed, and therefore it is a coalition of
losers.
'Even if we are not going to be governing now, one thing is certain,' he
added, 'we will certainly be doing so in 1998, or even sooner. It cannot be
excluded that this coalition will face real difficulties in the course of
the coming legislative period.'
The same prediction was made by Mr Ludger Vollmer, joint leader of the
environmentalist Greens. 'I am not at all sure that Kohl and Kinkel will be
able to survive a full four years,' he said.
The temptation for Mr Kohl might be to switch to a grand coalition with the
SPD, in order to have a reliable working majority, and in recognition that
such an outcome is already inevitable in practice: the SPD enjoys a majority
in the Bundesrat, the second house of the parliament representing the 16
federal states.
The other alternative, a so-called 'traffic light coalition' of the SPD,
Greens and FDP, was flatly rejected last night by FDP leaders, including Mr
Otto Lambsdorff, the immediate past leader. He said the party would rather
go into opposition than participate in such an alliance.
The biggest loser in the election was the FDP, which was set to lose about
30 seats. In spite of the setback, however, a delighted Mr Kinkel was
celebrating last night, because with its vote forecast at about 7 per cent
of the total, the party would keep its place in the parliament.
The far-right Republicans failed to make any impression on the election,
with a final vote forecast at less than 2 per cent.
In the three state elections which took place simultaneously with the
general election, the SPD narrowly retained its absolute majority in the
Saarland, in west Germany, but failed to dent the lead of the CDU in the two
east German states involved, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Thuringia.

FT  17 OCT 94 / Ford to buy 7% stake in Indian carmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford of the US, the world's second-largest vehicle maker, is taking a
minority stake in Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, one of the top 10 private sector
groups in India.
It said it would pay about Dollars 50m (Pounds 31.6m) for a 7 per cent stake
in the automotive and tractor manufacturer.
The US company's move into India's fast-growing market follows recent,
similar initiatives by several leading carmakers, including General Motors,
Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and Daewoo. They are scrambling to establish a
presence in emerging markets, especially Asia and Latin America.
Ford and Mahindra are to launch a feasibility study into the manufacture of
Ford vehicles in India, which should be concluded by mid-1995. It is
expected to lead to a joint venture company with equal Ford and Mahindra
shareholdings, which will set up a new plant - probably for the assembly of
vehicles developed by Ford in Europe.
Ford's acquisition of a minority stake must be approved by Mahindra
shareholders at a meeting on November 10.
Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, said the company
intended 'to be a significant participant in India's automotive industry in
the near future'. Last year, Ford started production of aluminium radiators
in a plant near New Delhi in a joint venture with Sumitomo and Maruti.
Other moves this year in India include:
GM of the US formed a joint venture with Hindustan Motors to invest about
Dollars 100m to assemble the Opel Astra, with production planned to begin in
the third quarter of 1995.
Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany, formed
a joint venture with Tata Engineering &amp; Locomotive (Telco) of India, one of
the world's leading makers of commercial vehicles, with an investment of
about DM250m (Pounds 102.5m) for the assembly in India of Mercedes-Benz
E-Class executive cars as well as petrol and diesel engines. Volkswagen of
Germany, the leading European carmaker, signed a memorandum of understanding
last month with Eicher Goodearth to study feasibility of joint vehicle
production in India. The Eicher group produces Mitsubishi light commercial
vehicles under licence in India.
Daewoo, the South Korean conglomerate and the country's third-largest
carmaker, has bought a majority stake in DCM-Toyota, an Indian truck maker,
which it plans to transform into a carmaker.
Volkswagen said Asia offered the strongest prospects for growth in the world
car market - annual sales in India are expected to double to up to 500,000
by 2000. India's car market is dominated by Maruti, a joint venture between
the government and Suzuki of Japan.

FT  17 OCT 94 / New York state bids Dollars 2.5bn for electricity company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The state of New York has decided to buck the worldwide trend towards
privatisation by announcing plans for a Dollars 2.53bn (Pounds 1.59bn)
takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, a private sector electricity
company quoted on the New York Stock Exchange.
While some electricity companies in the US have always been publicly owned,
this is believed to be the first time a state has proposed buying out the
shareholders of a private-sector company and bringing it into public
ownership.
Mr Mario Cuomo, the Democratic governor of New York state, says the object
of the takeover is to reduce electricity prices for Long Island consumers
and businesses. At present, the rates charged by the Long Island Lighting
Company - known to its few friends as Lilco - are the highest in the US, if
not the world.
The bid is likely to prove highly popular with the voters of Long Island.
Significantly, it also happens to have been launched at a time when Mr Cuomo
is locked in a fierce battle for re-election.
Lilco's electricity prices are high because the company is burdened with
Dollars 5.3bn of debt, the legacy of spending Dollars 5.5bn between 1973 and
1984 building a nuclear power station at Shoreham on Long Island, which was
dismantled because of public concerns about safety.
At present, Lilco's electricity rates are 16.1 cents per kWh for residential
customers and 12.35 cents for industrial customers, roughly double the US
average. Mr Cuomo says a takeover by the state will result in an immediate
10 per cent cut in those rates, plus another 10-15 per cent cut later.
The financial logic of the bid is beguiling. Mr Cuomo says that, under
public ownership, Lilco will no longer need to pay federal taxes or
shareholder dividends, resulting in immediate savings of Dollars 250m a
year. Later, its debt will be refinanced with cheaper public sector debt.
The bid itself will be financed through an issue of tax-exempt revenue
bonds.
Yet if public ownership makes sense for Lilco, some argue, why not
nationalise all the other private-sector utilities? Or for that matter, the
rest of US industry?
Mr James McFadden, a utilities analyst at the securities house Bear Stearns,
says: 'The question is whether you want more utilities owned by the
government sector or not. Most folks in this country would say you want
smaller government, not bigger government, and this runs at cross-purposes
with that.'
On Friday Lilco said it was 'seriously evaluating' the proposal, but its
shares were trading only Dollars 1 1/8 up at Dollars 17 5/8 , far short of
the Dollars 21.50 a share proposed by New York state. At that price, the
market is betting either that the Federal government will intervene to block
the bid - or that Mr Cuomo will not be re-elected to pursue it.

FT  15 OCT 94 / MPs back value tests for drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday appeared to back plans to introduce tests that
would require new medicines prescribed on the National Health Service to
prove themselves to be economic or medical improvements on older rivals.
It praised proposals made by the Commons health committee in July that would
give new drugs five years' grace after they were approved for sale. After
this 'those which were found to be less effective, or more expensive with no
therapeutic advantage, than competitor drugs would be excluded from being
prescribed on the NHS', said the select committee in July.
The Department of Health's response to the report yesterday said that it was
considering such 'national prescribing list' schemes.
The department said: 'The way in which such a scheme might operate is well
described by the select committee.'
The NHS drugs bill is rising faster than in most big countries with the
exception of the US, in spite of last year's 2.5 per cent price cut imposed
by the government through its Pharmaceutical Prices Regulatory Scheme.
The prospect of a national prescribing list improving cost-effectiveness was
backed by the Labour party.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said the government needed to
'examine with more urgency the potential of a national prescribing list'
which would direct research by drug companies towards examining the
cost-effectiveness of new drugs, which would be of more use to the NHS.
Dr Joe Collier, editor of Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin, said: 'This
is a very exciting development and I'm delighted that the Department of
Health appears to warm to it.'
The Association of the British Pharmaceuticals Industry, which has long
resisted radical reform to the way in which drugs are assessed and
prescribed, attacked the proposal.
It remained 'convinced that any such list restricting the availability of
medicines would not be in the interest of patients and would also adversely
affect the search for much-needed new treatments'.
It said the health department had conceded that a national prescribing list
would not be cheap or easy to operate. Such a scheme would be radical even
in a world where healthcare reforms are being considered by many countries.
So far, only Canada and Australia have insisted on considering the economic
impact of individual drugs.
The department rejected the committee's recommendations that prescription
charges and the number of people eligible for free prescriptions be cut.
It also rejected the committee's concerns that the drug industry's voluntary
code of practice for marketing to doctors might be being breached and that
statutory restrictions on promotional activities such as gifts and
hospitality were not being enforced.

A trader said: 'I think the market has already partially discounted the

Shares closed off 2.2 per cent in volatile trade on the Sao Paulo bourse on
speculation ahead of the options settlements on Monday and widespread

FT  15 OCT 94 / Sunday Times price slashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sunday Times announced last night that it was halving the price of the
paper to 50p tomorrow, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The move immediately raised fears that Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News
Corporation, intended to intensify the national newspaper price-cutting war
from his flagship daily titles The Sun and The Times to his dominant title
in the sunday broadsheet market, The Sunday Times, which routinely sells
more than the combined sales of its immediate opposition at an average 1.2m
per Sunday.
However, the price cut has been co-ordinated with the serialisation of The
Prince of Wales - A Biography which starts its three-week run tomorrow. All
the signs last night were that News International has cut the cover price of
the newspaper to boost sales during the serialisation of the royal book.
The company declined to say how long the price cut would last, but it seemed
extremely unlikely that it would run beyond the serialisation unless
astonishing circulation gains are achieved.
Although sales of The Sun and The Times have risen, it is highly unlikely
that the increased sales have covered the loss in revenue. To consider
selling The Sunday Times for 50p for longer than a token period would
seriously affect the company's income.

Currency factors tripped up a UK stock market which had taken in its stride
the widely heralded US data on consumer prices, retail sales and industrial
production. Wall Street made little response to the economic statistics
which were seen as largely neutral and likely to reduce the chances of an
early tightening in Federal Reserve policy. At the close, the FT-SE 100
Index was 35.2 points down at 3,106.7, having barely held above 3,104
earlier. The final total of 575.2m shares through the Seaq electronic

FT  15 OCT 94 / Israelis seal town in search for kidnapped soldier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE and KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM, OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Israeli defence force was refusing last night to confirm reports that
19-year-old Corporal Nachshon Waxman, the Israeli soldier facing a death
threat from the extremist Islamic Hamas movement, had been found alive in
the town of Ramallah on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israeli forces had
nevertheless sealed off the town.
As Israel and the Palestinian Palestine Liberation Organisation struggled to
save the Middle East peace process from collapse, the crisis overshadowed
the award of the Nobel peace prize yesterday to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's
prime minister, Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat,
PLO chairman.
Hamas had said it would kill Corp Waxman unless Israel released Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, and 200 other Palestinian prisoners.
As the deadline was due to expire last night, an emergency session of the
Israeli cabinet ruled out meeting the kidnappers' demands and rejected a
dialogue with the Islamic fundamentalists.
However, Hamas later said it would extend the deadline by 24 hours,
following an Israeli offer, delivered secretly by a member of the Knesset.
Mr Arafat, under intense pressure from Israel and the US to secure the
release of the soldier, ordered the arrest of more Hamas members in the Gaza
Strip. Palestinian officials said more than 200 Islamic activists were being
held yesterday.
Israel has chosen to make the safe release of Corp Waxman a test of Mr
Arafat's ability to increase security for Israelis. Mr Rabin has said Mr
Arafat must make 'a strategic choice' between continuing the peace process
and dealing with Hamas.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, echoed Israel's demands in a
meeting with Mr Arafat in Egypt yesterday. Mr Christopher said he had told
the PLO leader to 'confront the reign of terror imposed by Hamas'.
Hamas, outraged at the widescale arrests of its activists, has also said
that Mr Arafat must choose between Hamas and the peace process. Mr Mahmoud
Zohar, a leading Hamas activist in Gaza, warned Mr Arafat would 'have to
suffer the consequences' if he continued his clampdown. 'Preserving
Palestinian peace is better than preserving peace with Israel,' he said.
Mr Arafat's aides have cautioned Israel and the international community
against making demands for a direct confrontation with Hamas, saying the
peace deal is still too fragile and the benefits too limited to guarantee
that the pro-peace forces would win against a strong and organised
opposition.
The controversial award of the Nobel peace prize to Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin
was expected after being leaked earlier this week in a newspaper in Oslo.
But it was not widely anticipated that Mr Peres would also be named. It is
the first time the peace prize has gone to more than two recipients.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Truth of the Matter: Oxbridge arrogance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The changing-room chant of Magdalene College Rugby Club, traditionally a
generous supplier of university and international stars, will resound
painfully in the ears not only of their opponents, but also among the latest
Oxbridge-knockers.
To stagger out of dinner with Sir David Calcutt, the retiring Master of
Magdalene, and witness his benign indulgence of 15 beefy men in black tie
lined up to urinate on a herbaceous border, would horrify the
Oxbridge-knockers even more.
There are times when Oxbridge lays itself open to its detractors; it becomes
almost a parody of Brideshead and the world of wing collars, cavalry twill,
and sherry with the dons.
But anyone watching the arrival of freshers at Oxford and Cambridge this
week would be bound to conclude that while old buildings survive, precious
little survives of the mannered student lifestyle.
So far as external appearances go, these are the same young people who are
rolling up to universities and colleges all over the country.
If rugby is an index of typical background, then it ought to be pointed out
that the mainstays of recent Cambridge teams have come from a Swansea
comprehensive school.
Playing rugby with style and commitment might be called arrogance by some,
pride by others. But to perpetuate the mythology of some cabbalistic,
public-school, backward- looking Oxbridge is pure prejudice, and it is a
prejudice to which Walter Ellis (author of The Oxbridge Conspiracy) must
confess.
To chronicle the invasion of public life by Oxbridge graduates is nothing
new. So long as glaring exceptions (John Major, Richard Branson, et al) are
overlooked, it is more or less accurate: a predictable, gratifying state of
affairs.
Academically, it arises directly from the recruitment of students with the
best A-levels. Whether those students come from state schools or private
schools is, to an extent, beyond Oxbridge control. It is worth noting,
however, that King's, the Cambridge college which has done most to
discriminate positively in favour of state-educated students, is enjoying
conspicuously good finals results.
The fact that Oxbridge graduates dominate theatre, television and so on is
equally easy to explain. I taught for three years at a 'provincial'
university, and during those three years not a single theatrical production
was staged by the students there.
At Cambridge, by contrast, one can hardly move for the fly-posting of latest
attractions. And play is taken as seriously as work by so many at Oxbridge
that it is no wonder they go on to capitalise on the experience generated by
the self-driven engine of drama and other enthusiasms.
But Walter Ellis nurses more than envy. His contention is that Oxbridge
traditionalism is a 'narcoleptic' and that under its influence 'Britain has
been sleep-walking into Europe's second division'.
It is tempting to respond to this charge of institutional inertia with the
boasts we usually reserve for tourists - that Trinity College has given the
world more Nobel prize winners than the whole of France, that the shifting
of Oxbridge brains across the Atlantic is one of Britain's best export
achievements, etc.
But perhaps more prosaic data are in order. The quickest way of registering
just how technocratic Oxbridge is now would be to consult a list of
recently-completed doctoral dissertations: about 75 per cent of these are
highly technical scientific studies.
Norman Tebbit's 1983 pledge to take away public support for those wishing to
study tribal habits in the Upper Volta has been largely fulfilled. It is now
extremely difficult, at Oxbridge and elsewhere, to secure a government grant
for any doctoral research in the humanities.
The dynamics of the job market are utterly misunderstood by Oxbridge
knockers such as Ellis. Currently, many Cambridge graduates go on to take a
further degree: a measure of the global village requirement for highly
specialised skills.
Commercial and management consultancy work is the next most common
destination, with law and accountancy following. According to last year's
figures, the best degree you could do in terms of employment prospects was
manufacturing engineering; the worst, Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic. But a
greater percentage of classicists secured jobs than chemical engineers.
Probably the most indicative statistics concern the physicists. Of the 100
or so graduates in 1993, more than half went on to further research. Fewer
than 10 per cent went into industry, and barely 1 per cent into teaching.
There may be something wrong for Britain in that pattern: but, if it is a
problem then it is beyond Oxbridge control.
Oxbridge-knockers in the past devised league tables to test efficiency.
Oxbridge responded by coming top, with Imperial College London joining the
'golden triangle' of lucratively high research ratings.
So long as success brings money, it is hard to see how Oxbridge will be
dislodged from the top.
In spite of this, there are problems looming: the present government's
hostility towards paying the college fee - a supplement which helps to fund
the supervision or tutorial systems at Oxbridge, both prodigal of time and
money - may yet destroy an educational method admired everywhere in the
world except Whitehall.
Some voices predict that the ultimate Oxbridge answer will be to follow the
Americans and go private: if Ellis wants to see real elitism, that is what
they will get - high-quality education for rich kids only.
We hope it never happens. There is no need for British self-denigration to
extend itself to Oxbridge. Arrogance, arrogance. We want not less, but more
arrogance.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Coffee and the reason for living: When it comes to cafes,
London yields to most of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN

<TEXT>
I probably take coffee too seriously. When I order my morning cappuccino, I
keep a guilty, but beady, eye on the hapless dupe whom I have randomly
picked out to kick-start my day, just to check that nothing is amiss: that
the amount, quality and pressure applied are as they should be; that the
milk is not allowed to boil; that it is gently coaxed into the cup; and,
finally, that no one dares sprinkle chocolate on top (a violent lurch across
the counter coupled with a low, rumbling sound in Dolby stereo usually does
the trick).
The afternoon espresso poses fewer problems, but vigilance is still
required. It must be small, strong, thick, black as soot but topped with a
subtle film of golden-brown which just catches the light as you twirl the
cup in your hand.
Obsessive, I know, but then coffee is a way of life; an integral part, dare
I say it, of European civilisation. With frontiers ever shifting, holiday
destinations turning into battlefields and finance ministers springing in
and out of monetary systems as if in a country dance, what better way is
there to define and defend this troubled continent than to celebrate the
splendour of its cafes?
The will to while away the hours over a cup of Arabia's finest unites Paris,
Rome, Madrid, Athens, Amsterdam - every European megalopolis which prides
itself on cultural vitality and elan. All these cities understand the
creative link between intellectual fertility and the coffee house. But
London, alas, cannot count itself among them.
From Potsdam to St Petersburg, as we speak, brilliant minds are shaping
philosophies for the new millennium in a glorious haze of caffeine-charged
inspiration, lucid as laser-beams, while the British can only sup their
placid pints of mild-and-bitter and dream about village greens and the 19th
century.
Over-stating my case? Imagine the scene: Jean-Paul Sartre and his sidekicks
are meeting for a few hours of reflective debate at the Jug and Firkin. It
is a sultry, crepuscular evening, the master is at the bar: 'Ah, Simone,
bonsoir] What's your poison?'
'I'd love a pint of Ruddles, please, Jean-Paul. Shall we sit down?'
'Well, it's a bit crowded. Why don't we join the hundreds of people standing
outside, spilling beer all over each other because their glasses are too
full, making sure we don't take up too much of the pavement, precariously
balancing our pork scratchings against our Heidegger texts and invent a new
philosophy?'
Hell really is other people when you have to fight your way into a London
pub in the summer. Has it not occurred to anyone that Britain's cultural
life has been crippled as a result of its refusal to embrace the bean?
To be fair, things are changing. It is possible to find the odd part of Soho
where one can spend an hour or two in relative comfort, drinking respectable
coffee and imagining, for a moment or two at least, that there is revolution
in the air.
And the city which never goes to sleep (because it never properly wakes up)
is actually at the forefront of an exciting coffee-related development - the
Internet cafe. Cyberia ('the world in a coffee cup'), just behind Tottenham
Court Road, is a brand new concept in customer service, where you can sit in
front of a screen and surf on the super-highways, as it were, communicating
with enthusiasts all over the world while nibbling a croissant and sipping
the golden liquid.
I tried it; the spirit of intellectual inquiry knows no technological
boundaries. But when it comes to information super-highways, I find it quite
hard to leave the hard shoulder. I wanted to send out a message asking if
anyone wanted to set a new agenda with me for the post-historical world, but
I got stuck in the England football team for Wednesday's international
against Romania. In other words, I used it exactly like a newspaper, which I
know is my problem rather than Cyberia's, but I cannot honestly see it
catching on. Are people not meant to talk to each other in cafes, or is that
old-fashioned?
To idle away at a pavement cafe is more, much more, than a blissful waste of
time; it is an act of defiance. It says to all those around you who are
buzzing to work or racing home: Wait. There is more to your lives than this.
Relax, and think about the world in a different way. Smoke a pipe, write a
novel, argue about the existence of God. It is part of our ancestors' rich
heritage, and it is the reason life is worth living.
I probably take coffee too seriously.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Private View: Author of many characters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who is Doris Lessing? By reputation, of course, she is the famous writer. To
meet, she is a woman of seductive frankness. According to the calendar, she
is 75 years old next Saturday.
Lessing herself says she is several people.
As Doris Tayler, a fraught and sensuous child in Southern Rhodesia, she took
cover behind a mask called 'Tigger', the bouncy character from
Winnie-the-Pooh. Was Tigger still around, I asked her?
'Oh, she emerges from time to time, usually when I'm in false positions and
I need protection. Out she pops.'
Is the person she's protecting in this room now?
'My real self is an observing person and somewhat solitary person, I would
say, even when there are a lot of people around.'
And when you come to observe yourself . . .?
'Ah,' she interrupted, 'but we are not just one person at all. We're
composites of people. I'm much more interested in the different kinds of
people inside one's skin.'
The first volume of her autobiography, which comes out on Thursday, is
entitled Under My Skin.
So who are these various Doris Lessings? The first, she said, is The
Observer, 'a defended observation post', who seems to do all her remembering
for her. A second is The Hostess, a continuation of Tigger, a well-behaved
person who 'adores cooking and having little evenings'.
'And then there's the one I totally disapprove of, which is the unhappy
child that is sorry for itself. She is an immensely self-pitying creature.'
The autobiography started as a defence against the 'fantasies' and
'unbelievable inaccuracies' (she gave examples) of biographers and
interviewers. Then it became interesting. But to relive her childhood had
been painful, she said, and gave her nightmares.
Was it your third person who had the nightmares?
'You tell me who dreams before I answer that. Who does the dreaming? No,
this is a serious question. How do we know it's not different people doing
the dreaming? I mean, the older I get - forgive me for that boring remark -
the more I don't know, the more questions there are.'
Lessing asked a lot of such questions during nearly two hours in which she
talked about herself with a critical detachment far too passionate to be
called clinical. Sitting calmly - almost motionlessly - in a deep sofa she
seemed both forceful and vulnerable. She was tireless, inquisitive, intense.
I left exhausted.
I had arrived with my own hypothesis (or fantasy): that Doris Lessing, twice
married, twice divorced, who left two children in Africa and brought her
third to London, could be explained as the emotional victim of her mother.
She agreed that her mother, Emily, tried to bind her 'with bands of steel'
and she had to fight her to get out from under.
'She was a very talented woman. She could have been a musician. She was very
efficient, immensely social, very clever at school. But she found herself
nursing a very sick man' (Alfred Tayler had lost a leg in the first world
war) 'stuck in the middle of the bush. She wanted me and my brother to live
her life for her.'
Lessing's daughter in Africa has two girls. Her older son, whom she
described as brave and romantic, never married and died of a heart attack
two years ago. Her son of the second marriage, who lives near her in London,
is also unmarried. She resisted further questions about him. The children of
the famous had enough to put up with, she said.
When I asked her if she had been a possessive mother in her turn, she said
absolutely not. 'Because I'm too much of an egotist. I'm always thinking
about my next book.'
Are parent-child relations a kind of curse?
'Yes, they are. Much better if we didn't have any parents at all. I remember
saying so, often and loudly.' She laughed.
My hypothesis was looking increasingly ragged as Lessing went on to explain
how her life had also been shaped by the suffocation she felt in a colonial
community. 'It was provincial and narrow and immensely self-satisfied. And
of course white superiority . . . it was horrible. I hated it.'
More important still, she said, was the overriding influence of the first
world war, an event that had brutalised generations.
'You have miseries thrust at you day and night. You have the dead soldiers
and the 'Angels of Mons' and you have star-shells and No-Man's-Land and
corpses and the whole lot, day and night.
'It meant I was brought up with the rage of a soldier who felt that he had
been betrayed - and he wasn't unique, that's the point. He had total
contempt for the British government and a kind of inbred belief that any
kind of authority was crooked.
'This was probably in the long run more important than my mother, who, after
all, I got away from.'
When I asked her about her marriages and suggested her life had been
'rackety', she scarcely blenched.
'I was too young to be married,' she said simply. 'I was really
psychologically infantile. I was like a bright competent, efficient girl,
that's what I was, in both marriages. It was much better with my poor old
Gottfried (Lessing, a Russian-born German refugee and committed communist)
than with Frank (Wisdom, a civil servant) because we were so ill suited that
we had to be terribly kind to each other, which was something.' She laughed.
You never wanted to marry again?
'Well, in theory, yes. In practice you have to marry somebody, don't you?
And that's . . .' she laughed again . . .'a bit difficult. There are a
couple of men that I would have been very happy with but unfortunately they
were the wrong age.' She meant they were 15 years too young.
After she had explained about her clutch of secret personae, I asked: Has
living in your head been an enjoyable thing?
'I wouldn't say enjoyable. But what would I do instead?' (She would have
liked to be an old-fashioned farmer) 'Anyway, I don't do nothing. I planted
60 tulips just before you arrived. That's not entirely living in my head.'
Later, however, she agreed that the business of recording life meant there
was less time for living it.
In her sixties, Lessing was struck down by inexplicable grief. 'This wasn't
depression - I know the difference - and I don't know what it was about. A
most appalling and terrible grief and there was no reason for it.'
The Observer added: 'Why is it that an emotional condition makes your heart
physically painful? Why is it that your heart feels as if you'd just like to
pick it up and throw it over a cliff when you're unhappy? This is an odd
thing, surely, when you find yourself taking aspirin for heartache . . .
This is crazy.' She thinks there is a link between homesickness, exile,
being in love, and death.
Why is she a writer? Because she always was one. She had to do it. I asked
what that meant.
'I think it's some form of psychological balancing mechanism, actually. If
you are a writer, by definition it seems to me you're pretty neurotic. And
the whole writing business is some way of coming to terms with it.'
Writing's not a job, I said.
'Oh yes it is. What is a job then?'
Writing is an occupation, a sort of therapy.
'That's one way of looking at it. You make it sound almost totally
self-indulgent. I mean, other people quite like what you write, sometimes.'
Do you do it for that?
'No. Because you have to. It's what you are. I would have said it's a
necessity. It's a need to . . . to understand. Or maybe it's a need for
order, as I've been wondering recently, imposing order on chaos. You see,
you're making it too intellectual.'
Novels were invaluable as information, she said, a fact not properly
recognised. 'A great deal of our knowledge of the world and our fellow human
beings comes from literature.' She described a businessman friend who
whenever he was going to a new country would go to the library and take out
all the novels written about it.
Do you a feel you have had an influence on the world?
'Yes, I have had a small influence. Not enormous.'
What has it been?
'I was one of the people who changed attitudes about what was going on in
southern Africa. And I think I've changed attitudes about how men look at
women.
'Only last week I had a letter from a man in Mexico who had just read The
Golden Notebook and said he'd no idea women ever talked about anything but
husbands and babies. Well, this kind of thing's quite cheering, really.'
Is old age a nice place to arrive at?
'I see things differently, It's a continuum. But I do regret the lack of
energy. You'll suddenly find energy leaking out of your fingertips and toes
for no reason whatsoever. This is not nice.
'But I don't mind being old. It's a question of what you expect. I have a
very distant view of myself and life, you know. You get more and more
detached about yourself, particularly if you write an autobiography and know
it would have been quite a different book at 50.'
The most important thing in Lessing's inner life has been her 30-year-long
study of Sufism. Predating Islam, with which it is usually associated, it is
an intuitional search for knowledge akin to Christian mysticism but not
itself an 'ism'. Nor is it, Lessing said emphatically, a cult or a religion.
'God forbid] I loathe religion.'
As the author has herself written, part of the search involves seeing
through what the Sufis call 'the commanding self', a false personality
created by parents, society, the era. Inside is the small and precious real
self waiting to be reached.
She is trying to become a Sufi herself. She must know, therefore, that
wrapped inside the many Doris Lessings there is, under the skin, just one.

FT  15 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: Take a share in the drama of owning a
racehorse - Why part of a horse need not cost an arm and a leg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time was when owning a racehorse was the preserve of kings, plutocrats,
potentates, sheikhs and pop-stars. In other words, it was a conspicuous part
of the way of life of the most conspicuous consumers in the land.
These days, however, owning a racehorse, or more accurately a part thereof,
has become a much more democratic option. It is no longer the exclusive
preserve of the seriously rich and can be enjoyed for an annual sum that
need not amount to very much more than the cost of a car or a long-haul
holiday.
The racing fraternity has laboured long and hard to find these new recruits.
The budget of two years ago, which decreed that VAT could be reclaimed on
both the capital and training costs, has effectively reduced the cost by
17.5 per cent and this, coupled with the fact that the old snobbish taboos
are gradually being eroded, means that there is a new breed of racehorse
owner around.
From nurses and builders to sub-postmistresses and civil servants, they are
as diverse a bunch as can be found anywhere. The one thing they have in
common is a love of horses and a desire to get closer to the world of racing
than writing out a betting slip on a Saturday afternoon.
Like an actor who craves the hot lights and grease-paint, they want to be in
the stands cheering on their very own fancy, chatting up the jockeys, sizing
up the form, sharing in the tips and gossip of the saddling ring.
Unlike the Aga Khan or Sheikh Mohammed these new-style owners are seldom
seen swapping anecdotes with the queen and they are happy to own a mere
portion of a horse.
They belong to partnerships which, under racing authority rules, can never
be larger than 12. For this they get almost all the fun that sole owners do.
They get to help choose the racing colours, to discuss intricate matters of
training, to visit the stables, to discuss racing tactics and, most
importantly for many, are allowed in the owners' enclosures at race
meetings.
As the traditional land-owning classes have become less involved in the
sport, almost every trainer in the land has had to seek new patrons and
hardly any of them get by without partnership-owned horses.
The new-style owner is seldom to be found at Ascot: National Hunt racing is
less expensive for those working within a budget, while some, of course,
prefer it. National Hunt racing is, in racing terms at least, a kind of
counter-culture. It has its roots in farming, raising stock and hunting and
at race meetings it shows.
Here are not the big hats and swanky frocks of the smart flat-racing season.
There are no Aga Khans and Maktoums flying in from Paris and Dubai.
National Hunt racing is for fun, a hobby. Prize money is lower (on average
Pounds 2,000 over hurdles where the young horses start and Pounds 3,000 over
the jumps to which they graduate). And the male horses are nearly always
gelded so there is no chance of a great payback at stud.
But against that, all being well, the racing life of a jumper is usually
much longer - on average something like seven or eight years as opposed to
two on the flat.
Buying into a partnership can be had these days for a rock-bottom starting
price of about Pounds 1,200 a year in training costs and vet bills and an
initial outlay of not much more - though if you are buying the equine
equivalent of a Rolls-Royce your capital costs will be hugely different from
those who are buying a Mini.
Two people with experience of sharing a horse are Alan and Sarah Waller, two
senior administrators with the National Health Service. They say they are
well-paid but would never describe themselves as rich.
They have a quarter share in Montagnard, a 10-year-old jumper. A builder
owns a half and a racing journalist the other quarter. Montagnard is trained
at Mark Bradstock's yard at Letcombe Bassett in Berkshire.
Alan got into racing because his parents took him racing as a child. 'I had
loved everything about it. I wanted to feel a part of that world. We started
by leasing a horse that belonged to somebody who had lost all his money in
BCCI. We didn't have much luck with it but it gave Sarah and me a taste for
the sport.
'We enjoyed saying we owned a horse, we liked visiting it, checking on its
form. We got to know the trainer and met lots of friends. Now having a share
in Montagnard has increased the fun. It's a hobby for the whole family.'
Another of the horses Mark Bradstock is training - Garston le Gaffe - is
owned by 25 people in the village of Garston (for these purposes they turned
themselves into a limited company, which is another route into horse
ownership).
From the postmaster and mistress, a security guard and salvage consultant to
an Irish County sheriff and a local solicitor, most of the village seems to
have a share. The horse is the last racing relative of the great
steeplechaser Arkle and he has not raced as much as Bradstock would have
liked. But for the Pounds 10,000 it cost six years ago and the Pounds 10 a
week each for training fees, the village has had a lot of fun. It has won a
novice hurdle at Uttoxeter and been placed more than a dozen times.
Vets' bills can make the real costs a little open-ended, however. Alan
Waller is rueful about the vet bills that Montagnard seems to be running up.
The National Hunt season is only just under way and the Bradstock stable has
made a good start. Go Universal won at 12-1 at Chepstow, bringing intense
excitement to the small company that owns it, and The Millwright, owned by
Sue Mills (she and her husband are the only owner/breeders at the Bradstock
stables) came in at 9-2 at Cheltenham last week.
Paddy Whitby, assistant trainer at the Bradstock stables, believes that even
those who could afford to fund a whole racehorse might have more fun by
owning a 12th share in each of 12 horses - this offers twelve times the
drama and 12 times the chance to win.
All the owners stressed that one of the most important aspects was to choose
a trainer who was close enough to visit easily - being part of the training
set-up was a large part of the fun.
They are all also at pains to point out that the rewards of owning a horse
are seldom financial. For instance, something like 90 per cent of owners
never get a win and 70 per cent never get a place in any one year.
As Alan Waller said: 'All you need is two wins a season to break even with
your training fees, or three wins to cover all the costs.' Or as another
owner put it: 'You have got to be prepared to take the rough with the
rough.'
And the Mills, owner of The Millright, warned: 'There are the bad days, the
endless disappointments, the driving all over the country to race-meetings -
you have to be an optimist. But the good days, when your horse wins . . .
then you know it's the sport for you.'
It was George Raft who had a perfect explanation for how he got rid of his
fortune. 'Well, some went on women, some on gambling, and some went on
horses; the rest I spent foolishly.' If you feel like him, then racing could
be for you.
For those who fancy giving it a whirl, Mark Bradstock has put together a
proposal for a Three Horse Partnership. For a capital outlay of Pounds
12,400 and monthly training fees of Pounds 712.50 you get a 20 per cent
share in each of three young horses, all five-year-old geldings. For a
pamphlet including photographs and costings, write to: Mark Bradstock, The
Old Manor House, Letcombe Bassett, Wantage, Oxon. Tel 0235-760780.
The Racehorse Owners Association 071-486 6977 publishes 'The Thrill of
Ownership' a leaflet which takes would-be owners through the stages from
buying a horse to choosing a trainer. The British Horse Racing Board, 44
Portman Square, London W1, is another source of valuable information.

FT  15 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: Sweet smell of skin-care - A look at a
beauty products shop about to open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jo Malone has been tending some extremely high-profile faces for several
years in her sweet-smelling flat near London's Sloane Square.
From Queens and Princesses to fashion editors and the beau monde every day,
an impressively elegant troupe heads up her narrow stairs.
Jo used to stay up late mixing her own creams and lotions and her customers
soon became addicted to them. For some time they were sold only to private
clients. But as word began to spread, and demand increased, Jo began to
broaden the range and sell it to a wider public.
Next week Jo opens her own shop selling the complete Jo Malone range.
Conventional make-up is not on offer - the beauty products are entirely
related to skin-care. There is a cleansing milk made from apricot kernel and
avocado oil, a skin tonic with juniper, a moisturising lotion with apricot,
avocado and almond oil as well as UV screens, eye gel with apricot and loe,
night cream with orange and geranium. All smell wonderful.
The girls in the shop have been trained by Jo to give proper skin-care
advice, not just to sell bottles of products.
But as well as the skin-care range, the shop, all cream and white like an
old-fashioned French perfumer's studio, will sell sweet smells in a
multitude of different packagings - bath oils, body lotions and colognes
scented with basil and mandarin, nutmeg and ginger, muguet, Verbenas from
Provence, grapefruit and Vertyver with spiced orange, and wild lavender with
amber.
Then there are scented artichoke trees, bundles of scented wild lavender,
pot-pourri smelling of orange and cinnamon, all beautifully packaged in
simple solid glass bottles with chrome tops.
It should be a splendid source of Christmas presents - heart-shaped folding
mirrors, scented candles and candle-holders, a sweet-smelling spray for the
linen cupboard, as well as a small selection of old-fashioned linens.
The shop opens on Monday at 154, Walton Street, London SW3.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Fashion: Catwalks of Milan inspire the Italian extremes -
Designers line up like opposing armies behind the twin kings, Versace and
Armani. Avril Groom went to view the results of these creative clashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italians have a word for it. Bravura is the exact description for their
attitude to fashion. There are two utterly opposite versions of Italian
style but the adherents of each have equal panache.
On the streets of Milan, style is as brash as the city's image. The
must-have accessories are a mobile telephone, a clutch of designer carrier
bags and a gilt complex, new-money symbols in a country where mass
prosperity arrived less than 30 years ago.
But, as hidden and subtle as the private courtyard gardens behind the blank
walls of the city's palazzos, there is also Milan's minimalist tendency. Its
followers - women whose attitudes have evolved beyond straightforward
showiness - are totally immune to the blandishments of even the most
gorgeous accessory and go about, apparently bare-faced and tousle-haired,
yet still looking wonderful.
Perhaps both extremes are inspired by the Milan catwalks where the division
in style is glaringly obvious as the designers line up like opposing armies
behind the twin kings, Versace and Armani.
Although everyone has apparently been watching retro films such as La Dolce
Vita and the re-runs celebrating Bardot's 60th birthday, the resulting
images are diametrically opposed. The lingerie-revealing or tightly-swathed
woman at Dolce e Gabbana, Blumarine, Genny and Krizia is the wicked
counterpart of the ingenue in her unadorned knee-length dress or belted suit
at Prada, Alberta Ferretti, Jil Sander, Industria or even Gucci.
There are some common links. The longer skirt, hovering somewhere around the
knee, is a fashion reality, as is the skinny-cut, glam-rock trouser suit in
a shiny fabric. Both are surfacing in the other fashion capitals as firm
pointers for next spring.
Sometimes the images blur. Versace proved that when he puts aside gilt
frippery and takes out his cutting scissors the results are drop-dead
glamorous rather than vulgar. While he lowered some of his skirts, Armani
raised his, with wrap-fronted organza shorts and discreetly beaded net tops
overtly and uncharacteristically sexy.
Instead of these shows inspiring the woman, the reverse is true. Milanese
designers aim to put clothes on bodies rather than roll back the frontiers
of fashion thinking. So absorbed is the Italian woman in fashion that the
home market accounts for a large proportion of an industry worth Pounds
35bn.
She is also a voracious consumer of imported fashion - international names
jostle for space in high-profile streets such as the Via della Spiga and
Corso Vittorio Emmanuele - and home-grown designers need to stay ahead of
the game.
So their designs have undoubted feminine appeal, either to the independent
woman for whom quality and feel is as important as adornment, or to those
who like to capitalise on their curves - and in a city where fishnet tights
and lace bodies are the current fads for normal office wear, there is no
shortage of those.
With these raw materials the best-dressed Italian women achieve striking
results. They do it partly by spending power. 'Young women spend hugely on
themselves,' says Laura Harris, an English 20-something working in Milan as
consultant fashion co-ordinator for Blumarine. 'Their priorities are
holidays, clothes, beauty, exercise classes and, later, plastic surgery.
It's easy to look good if you shop at Armani. Most Englishwomen try to look
stylish on Marks and Spencer.'
She finds Italian style tasteful but safe, lacking in individuality.
Designer Alberta Ferretti, acknowledged mistress of the little dress,
agrees. 'We can learn from British eccentricity, that willingness to try
something unexpected,' she says. When the British try, it too often looks
eccentric, but when the Italians try, it seems tastefully individual.
Ferretti thinks this has to do with simplicity. On the day we met,
simplicity for her was a pair of old diamond drop earrings, worn with a
plain black tunic dress of cobwebby knit and chiffon. Italian bravura again,
where the British would tend to overload.
Other examples we saw included a grey trouser suit worn with soft suede
burgundy loafers, the unadorned trousers and jacket worn by Jil Sander
Illustrations: Margaret Keedy that showed off her magnificent chronograph,
and bold colour-schemes such as the black velvet shift which jewellery
designer Angela Pintaldi picked up in New York as a vehicle for her heavy
swag of amber beads, soft orange velvet bag and deep crimson velvet
headband.
Constructing such an artfully simple look takes time. 'We have the choice of
many accessory and shoe firms, from factories to single artisans,' says
Ferretti.
Italy now has one of the world's lowest birthrates, so bambini create few
obstacles in the search for style.
'We always take time for our own personalities,' says actress Claudia
Cardinale, unofficial ambassadress for Armani. 'Looking good is part of it.
The secret is to buy the best, simple clothes so your individuality shines
through. I gave up wearing jewellery during the day two years ago. It is not
modern and detracts from me as a person. But hair is important. I like
small, neat hair - if it is not looking good I wear a crochet cap, which is
practical and individual.'
She was talking, resplendent in diamond earrings, at Armani's 20-year
celebration in his newly-acquired 18th-century Palazzo Orsini. Next morning
there was not a jewel in sight, just plain beige Armani which, she
explained, she could put with everything from jeans and sweater to a bra and
chiffon evening skirt.
For older women this meticulousness means full make-up and hair-do at all
times. Giorgio Guidotti, of MaxMara, says his mother would not even answer
the door unless her toilette was complete. Fiamma Ferragamo, whose family
firm's clothes and shoes, just on the sexy side of safe, are so successful
that they have recently overtaken Gucci's turnover, says that even for the
less wealthy a budget for hairdressser and beauty salon is normal.
If you are rich, the experts come to you. Wanda Galtrucco, a member of one
of Italy's leading textile industry families and a mature Versace client,
goes only to the hairdresser. All her other treatments are devised at home
by her personal beautician.
Tiny and lively, she is a perfect example of bravura. Far from believing
that Versace's mini-skirted suits are only for the young she feels they
'exalt my personality' and happily wears beaded jackets with jeans. She
sparkles in pale pink and, rather than vulgarising it with more gilt
jewellery, deftly adds fine antique gold and coral that ought to clash, but
somehow just works.
German designer Jil Sander shows and manufactures much of her collection in
Italy, which is her biggest export market. A committed minimalist, she has
seen changes in the past five years. 'Younger women's tastes veer towards
quality and fabrics which feel good on the body - opulent minimalism, in
fact. The media have spread these ideas among intelligent women globally but
Italian women caught on early.'
For many, the gym has replaced the beauty salon. Christina Malgara, Gucci's
Paris press attache, goes to the gym twice a week and likes a natural look,
which means make-up infinitely subtly applied. Tall and rangy, she wears her
company's clothes unconventionally.
This ease with their femininity comes, some of the women feel, from the
appreciative attitude of Italian men who judge aesthetically, rather than
socially like the English. 'If an Englishman sees a woman in a short skirt
and high heels he assumes she is not respectable,' says Giorgio Guidotti.
'An Italian will not care, as long as she looks good.'
The usual reason given for this concern for appearances in both sexes is an
Italian environment full of art and history. This is not convincing,
especially for those living in workaday cities such as Milan.
Guidotti's less attractive explanation is probably nearer the truth. 'Italy
is very provincial,' he says. 'Even Milan is a series of small communities.
Families do not move around a lot; everyone knows everyone else. Girls grow
up vying with each other, wanting to look good because they see the boy they
fancy on the way to school. It's pride and competitiveness.'
The results are legendary but they can, it seems, be learnt. Laura Harris
says her style has become more polished in her two years as a Milanesa.
Though her layered, skinny look could have been English, she consciously had
on a neat mini-kilt instead of an exaggerated A-line and sleek knee-high
boots instead of Dr Martens.
But she has not quite learnt all the little ways. She did not ask to see the
sketch our artist was making of her. Neither did Jil Sander. But every
Italian subject asked to see her bella figura before even the rough was
finished.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Fashion: A warrior shows off her armour - Me and My Wardrobe
/ Jane Mulvagh meets Steve Shirley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Remember 'Power Dressing' as depicted by the glossy magazines? A slip of a
girl in a shocking pink suit - all legs and heels - playing the corporate
game. By the 1990s strident was out and the silhouette collapsed under the
weight of recession and white-collar unemployment. So, was the Power Suit
just a fashionable carapace to be shed as easily?
Not for Steve Shirley. It is armour and she has been fighting behind it for
40 years, decades before the soubriquet 'Career Woman' was born. Donned for
survival rather than fashion, her shell is as integral a part of her being
as an armadillo's.
'I have contributed to the substantial world, not the fantasy world,' she
insists. 'This is the trouble with fashion magazines; all they are concerned
with is fantasy.'
Steve Shirley has not softened one iota in spite of her success - she
founded FI Group, a publicly quoted company which now has a Pounds 40m
turnover; she has been awarded an OBE and countless honorary degrees; and is
Master of The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.
 -Vera Stephanie Shirley (nee Buchthal) arrived in Britain in 1939, a
five-year-old Jewish refugee and orphan accompanied only by her sister. At
18 she got a job as a science assistant in the civil service.
She got by on a pittance, taking night classes in maths. There were so few
women in the lower clerical ranks that she learnt to dress to blend in.
'I was more concerned to hide my poverty, than my femininity,' she says. She
had two skirts, grey and black, and two tops in dark colours that could be
washed overnight. White was impractical as it showed the wear and tear.
By the age of 23 she had a maths degree, by 26 a husband and by 27, a
graduate position. On up the ladder and middle management ranks required
another skin - invisibility was replaced by transexual disguise. 'I took
advice from a senior woman who warned me, 'Do not forget, you are there as
an honorary man, so dress accordingly]''
Adopting the name Steve, she wore grey flannel suits, pin-tucked shirts,
black velvet ties and flat sensible shoes to secure her footing on the next
rung. 'Covering up . . . that is important in business,' she believes.
The man's name, the suit, will power and ability earnt her credibility and
by 1962 she had founded the FI computer software company. Could she decorate
herself now? 'No - fashion was way, way, away. It was a question of
clothing,' she retorts.
Gradually, the conformity of the grey suit was replaced by the markings of a
lone predator and a leader. Like a traditional soldier, she wore the bravado
hues of boardroom battle.
Colour was a weapon. She talks of reds with 'impact', 'powerful' blues,
'strong' purples, 'sharp' greens and 'my favourite yellow . . . the Jewish
colour of the stars worn in the ghettoes . . . I am visually literate, that
is certainly true, and I appreciate colour.
'I did Luscher's personality profile test - you choose the colours you
prefer. Mine were extreme - vibrant reds and oranges. It clearly showed that
I had drive and the clashing choices proved that I had the ability to cope
with problems and change. I need the stress.
'My husband thought I ought to dress better when I went into the office  -
not just when I went out selling - to assert my station.'
Wishing to conform to the emerging dress codes of women in the boardroom,
she sought professional advice. Nothing was left to chance.
Launching herself into the public domain, she was invited to make speeches.
And at 61 that public image persists and is being polished every day.
Methodically she researches every detail: she asks what colour backdrop she
will be speaking against and wears the right colours for maximum impact.
With them, she wears white training shoes, to avoid making a noise when
mounting the rostrum.
'Remember - a dozen people see you for each person you speak to. So dress to
be noticed.'
After 25 years as chairman and chief executive, she ceded control of the FI
Group to her workforce. Not wishing to challenge her nominated successor's
authority, clothes were used to signal non-threatening support. 'For the
first year I wore softer dresses, but then I went back to suits. I did not
want people to think that I had retired.'
The lessons learnt, she now wishes to pass them on. 'All things being equal,
I would always appoint a woman,' she says, insisting that positive
discrimination is her right, as without her the company would not exist.
She dispatches subordinates to be sharpened up sartorially; she gives
younger 'sisters' a leg up the corporate ladder. 'To move into senior
management and a leadership role I tell them that they must raise their
energy level with exercise, and dress more like a leader. You will not get
that promotion unless you dress for the next stage up. You may have sterling
qualities but you will not have that punch. Clothes simulate it.'
She recommends classic, non-sexual, tailored clothes, no trousers, no
frills, and nothing 'pseudo'. By this she means costume jewellery, for
example. It is important to proclaim financial success, especially in the
US.
Shirley is acquisitive about antique jewellery. 'I lost everything and I
want my jewellery to look as though it is an heirloom.'
Does she enjoy clothes? 'Er . . .yes. That sense of knowing you are wearing
expensive stuff. To a refugee who has been really poor that is important,
really important. I will probably never get over the fact that my mother
collected candle ends.'
With a touching and melancholy frankness she went further: 'I have a
profoundly handicapped child. While he was still at home everything we had
was smashed, and my clothes were something that could not get broken.'
We pass through her austere abode up to her treasure trove. Three wardrobes
stuffed with row upon row of neat plastic bags, all colour-coded and
sheltering her triumphant suits - perhaps 100 or more. One senses that she
longs to indulge after a lifetime's struggle; to soften up. But even at home
she wears a suit.
Does she like sexy clothes? 'A friend of mine was a consultant for Zandra
Rhodes. I tried on a dress and felt very, very sexy but immediately I knew
it wasn't me. I am not sentimental or illogical about clothes. But power is
quite an aphrodisiac. I get propositioned much more than I would expect at
my age.'
Shirley is still in the thick of the fray, fighting not only for herself but
for others now - for the disabled, for women students and entrepreneurs, for
equality. When you have been a warrior all your life, it is hard to put
aside your armour.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Fashion: High street winners - Lucia van der Post considers
her options for the coming winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a tiring time for fashion victims and for all those who are even now
seriously considering their sartorial options. Decisions, decisions.
Should one be a glamour-babe, teetering about in high-heels, with blonde
peroxide locks and hand-spun waist?
Or what about a more cutesy look - Laura Ashley meets Lolita, all floral
sprigs and little puffed sleeves?
Bella Freud did such a nice line and a fabulous jacket would only set one
back about Pounds 360.
If, on the other hand, you prefer something more exclusive, then Versace is
probably your man. He showed some darling little satin shorts and teemed
them with bra-tops and maribou-trimmed mules. At roughly Pounds 2,000 a
throw you should not have much competition round your way.
Me, I've given up. I am tired of extortionate prices, of a world where 'it's
quite cheap, really - only Pounds 500' comes to seem nearly normal and where
fashion victims will queue (in the cold) for two hours for the privilege of
parting with well over Pounds 100 for one particular pair of shoes. I'm
heading for the high street.
This is the year when the high street has truly come of age. We all know
about Marks and Spencer (even as I write I am sitting in its Pounds 30
charcoal grey mini-kilt teamed with ribbed grey tights that almost every
fashion editor in town has bought and at least one of whom wears it with a
Chanel jacket).
But this winter is a vintage M&amp;S season. The rush is on for the soft and
easy cashmere and wool blazer with the hand-stitching round the collar
(Pounds 95 in navy, black, aubergine, olive green or camel) and the young
are snapping up its A-line skirts at Pounds 20 a time and, for after dark,
short, chenille tunics at Pounds 40.
But M&amp;S is not the only success on the high street. Newcomers to Dorothy
Perkins and Principles, those who have never walked through their doors let
alone been seen clutching one of their tell-tale carrier bags, should put
their snobbisms to one side and take a proper look.
At Dorothy Perkins great efforts have gone into zipping up the ranges and
many a sober suit could be given new life with accessories from its
collection. A silver velvet scarf, for instance, at just Pounds 9.99 slung
around a jacket would add a bit of evening dash. There are up-to-the-minute
pleated skirts at Pounds 20 a time, a fabulous stone micro-fibre quilted
parka for just Pounds 49.99 and nubbly cardigans at prices ranging from
Pounds 25 to Pounds 45.
At Principles there is a great black jacket, slightly waisted with a small
kick-pleat at the back, for just Pounds 135 (bought by at least one of the
fashionable young public relations girls around town), as well as a
wonderful black three-quarter length coat for Pounds 145 and plenty of the
currently fashionable slightly mannish suits to choose from.
The trick is to take plenty of time. Be prepared to sift through things
carefully and there, lurking on the rails, are plenty of bargains to be
found.
One last thing - if you are worrying about what to wear after dark, it's
quite simple really.
At last week's British Fashion Awards dinner in the Natural History Museum,
what were the fashion crowd wearing? What was the choice of the people who
have access to discounts and special deals, and who survey the cream of the
designers' offerings? Black, black and yet more black.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Dispatches: A shaky convalescent patches up its wounds -
Dubrovnik
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN DARLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How do cities return to life? After war, the threads of urban life are more
easily knitted together than in scattered rural areas, but what of a city
like Dubrovnik, long dependent on tourism and little else, stranded at the
furthest finger-tip of Croatia?
Sunning herself in a warm corner of south eastern Europe, Dubrovnik is a
shaky convalescent uncertain of her prospects for full recovery.
The Old City, a potent symbol of Dubrovnik, is an hermetic, self-absorbed
place. Walled as securely as Aleppo, as other-worldly as Venice, its
atmosphere is curiously febrile.
Late on a hot Saturday afternoon the sound of blaring horns approaches;
Dubrovnik is traffic-free save for service vehicles. Expensive cars screams
into the square by St Blaise's church. It is a wedding. People are dressed
to the hilt, as expensive looking as the vehicles.
The whole event was theatre for anyone who cared to watch. Onlookers gasped
at the sheer nerve of this gesture of defiance to the poverty of
expectations.
Dubrovnik is still pock-marked, several of its important buildings shored by
scaffolding, but it has remained remarkably intact. Damage to roofs has been
largely made good, the breach in the city walls healed. Weals blasted into
the silky, cream-coloured limestone paving of the main street have been
patched with grey concrete, but the gashes in the flights of steps up to the
Jesuit church remain jagged reminders of outrage.
The Institute for Protection of Cultural Monuments, once happily disbursing
an annual Dollars 10m budget, now exists on a fraction of that sum. The
staff of 18 take home one fifth of their former salaries.
Much of their work is in compiling detailed evidence of the damaged villages
in the countryside behind Dubrovnik.
The old city received 49 shells in its three-month bombardment, but only
seven were primed to explode. Heroic tales include those of the Yugoslavian
admiral who is in jail for refusing to attack Dubrovnik and the army general
who fled to the city with his family rather than obey commands.
Piles of sandbags and stacked building materials are reminders that the
repairs go on.
A young-faced, grey-haired woman in black and a teenage girl scurry to and
fro down the lanes carrying roof tiles, which they pile on the steps. From
the walls, you can see recently planted fruit trees and well-tended
vegetable gardens; a city which has known siege speedily learns, and
remembers, old techniques of survival.
The women in the markets patiently wait to sell tiny heaps of grapes, figs
and tomatoes. Men living in damaged tourist hotels while their villages are
being revived, are bussed daily to the land from which much of the produce
is brought. Women are being trained to make traditional embroidery and
weaving for sale at home and abroad.
But it is said that life in the hotels is degenerating; drugs and
prostitution are making in-roads, fast movers beside the slow business of
rebuilding. Along the main street in the old city, the cafes are busy,
social centres where people effortlessly pass two hours of a morning. Pale,
bemused-looking Spanish country boys - not tourists, but UN forces taking a
day or two off duty - enjoy good coffee and gaze at the golden, careless
Dalmatian teenagers.
Signs of the desperate shrinkage of tourism are everywhere. The single
entrance to the walkway along the city walls (reduced from three), the thin
selection of souvenirs, the absence of guidebooks, and the solitude in which
one visits the museums that remain open.
The multi-lingual signs for rooms to rent are rusting fast. Discordancy of
mood meets one at every turn in this city. Eight 12-year-old girls link arms
and skip down a side street singing. Teenagers lounge outside a club, from
which a cloud of disco music billows.
'Where are you from, why are you here?' a couple of elderly men ask me one
afternoon. 'A conference,' I answer sheepishly.
'What use conferences?' one asks with justifiable cynicism. 'Where do I come
from?' he asks rhetorically. 'I am Montenegran, my wife is Croatian. My
family has lived in Dubrovnik for 70 years. I sailed the world for 30 years,
I could show my passport anywhere.
'Now, I belong nowhere, my son has no nationality. Where do we go from
here?'
The citizens of Dubrovnik hover between peace and war, between devastation
and rebuilding, waiting for answers, as the foreign delegates go home,
through an airport which asks you to declare your weapons before boarding
the aircraft.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Fishing: Hampshire pilgrimage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'All the way to Canterbury,' the lady with the lurcher shouted across the
river, as the dog pursued some scent through the undergrowth.
Unwittingly I was on the Pilgrims' Way. And from every shire in England, to
Canterbury they used to wend. Of course, Chaucer's pilgrims journeyed from
Southwark rather than beside the Itchen, just beyond Winchester's city
walls.
My own quest was of a rather different, less spiritual nature. So, having
strolled a little way through the water meadows which lie upstream from
where King Alfred's remains were lain to rest in Hyde Abbey, I cut north
from the Pilgrims' Way, and bid farewell to the Itchen.
I missed the little church of St Swithun at Headborne Worthy, and found
myself on a lane, with the A34 to Newbury a field away to keep me company.
Left to itself, this part of Hampshire - with its open slopes and
unremarkable inclines - must always have been a trifle dull. The activities
of the road builders have wrecked it utterly. Between them, half a dozen
mighty highways have sliced the landscape into noise-ravaged segments. I
hurried on.
My plan was to commune with rivers, my immediate intention to reach
Longparish on the Test for a leisurely lunch. But I was some way short when
my stomach told me it was time to eat, and the map told me that, among
Barton Stacey's straggle of thatched, timbered cottages was a pub. And so
there was, The Swan, and it was shut.
I pressed on, and a little way beyond Barton Stacey crossed a tributary of
the Test called the Dever, which I had heard of but never seen.
Lovely it was, small, crystal-clear, bursting with weed, a fine haven for
trout. There was a sign by the bridge proclaiming that the fishing was in
the hands of the Ministry of Defence. Enviously, I pictured the generals and
colonels, fly rods in their hands. Just beyond the stream is Dever Springs,
a still water open to all ranks, which is stocked with enormous rainbow
trout. It was circled by fishermen in baseball caps, battling with a gusty
wind.
Hungry, I came to a signpost which said Longparish one mile. I lengthened my
stride, covered a good half mile, then came to another signpost which said
the same as the previous one.
I trudged on, rehearsing sarcastic observations to Hampshire county
council's signpost department. But when I came to the Test, I noted
dispassionately that the water was temptation itself, and that the village
was as pretty as you could wish. What I needed, however, was a pub. And
there, on the Andover road, it was. The Plough, fondly remembered.
A crab salad and three pints of Boddingtons later, I could appreciate
Longparish. I could well understand how Colonel Peter Hawker - the early
19th century author of Instructions to Young Sportmen and a prodigious
slayer of Test trout - should have so loved it.
I lingered in the bar, beneath a faded photograph of the England cricket
team, led by WG Grace, which faced Australia in 1884. With the afternoon now
advanced, I followed what had been, the Stockbridge to Whitchurch branch
line of the Great Western Railway; now a dark, bramble-infested trench.
It brought me, with a diversion or two, to the tiny Bourne; which Harry
Plunket Greene celebrated in his Where The Bright Waters Meet.
I peered over the bridge and spied a big trout which sped off towards the
creeper-clad church at Hurstbourne Priors. Then I did what no true walker
should do. I thumbed a lift, and blessed the man in the red Sierra who
hastened me through St Mary Bourne and Hurstbourne Tarrant.
I regret having missed the two villages, and particularly being able to
check whether Cobbet's initials are still carved into the gatepost outside
Mr Blount's farmhouse by the bridge in Hurstbourne Tarrant. But the
alternative - for I had sadly misjudged either the distance or my own speed
 -was to arrive at my night's destination in the dark.
As it was, no more than a gentle stroll took me up the hill from the valley
of the Bourne, past a pair of old painted gipsy wagons, through a
poppy-strewn meadow, and up a path which cut through gloomy Faccombe Wood.
By seven I was in the pub in Faccombe, drinking more beer, and considering
my blisters.
I was high in the downs of north Hampshire and, in the morning, I limped
higher still, before descending a great, green, tree-thick bowl to the tiny
hidden hamlet of Combe.
Almost a century ago, that superb writer and naturalist, WH Hudson, bicycled
this way, was given lunch by the parson, and was shown the little church.
The parson told Hudson that a visitor from London, who had come intending to
stay a while, had found the silence so oppressive that he had fled back to
the city. That quality of silence remains, even though the church -
ever-open in Hudson's day - is now locked. There was no sound, no movement,
as I took the steep road to the great, smooth, grassed ridge from which may
be obtained one of the great views of southern England; and on which stands
one of its more curious landmarks, Combe Gibbet.
Hudson tells the grim tale: of a widow of Combe with two sons, and a lover
from the far side of the ridge; how he, in his passion, murdered his wife by
thrusting her into a hornets' nest; how the lovers were found out, and
executed before a crowd at this windswept spot on a gallows carefully placed
on the boundary between Combe and Inkpen, for there was a dispute between
the parishes as to who should pay.
A successor to that old gibbet still stands atop the ridge, gaunt and
sinister; though with no indication as to what it is doing there. The vista
is astonishing: to the south, a sweep of hill and dell, with Winchester and
the sea beyond; the north, a great, flat plain, with the Savernake Forest to
the left, and Newbury to the right.
All this I saw, then - having misread my map - made a precipitous descent
into Inkpen, largely on my bottom.
Revived by a brief stop at The Swan - an open Swan, thank goodness - I
hurried across the flat fields towards Kintbury. At Kintbury I found my last
river, the Kennet.
I watched a man cast ineptly for a trout. Then, outside the pub by the
canal, I saw tiny fry burst from the surface as a pike went after its
evening meal. It was dusk when the train came to take me back to the noisy
world.

FT  15 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: Save some headline space for au pairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A headline in the Swiss-German weekly Die Weltwoche the other day read:
'Switzerland is an invention of radicalism.' This view is not held widely,
but it turns out that modern Switzerland owes much to its Radical-Democratic
party. (So interesting was this story that it was reproduced in
French-language papers as well.)
In fact, the party has just celebrated the 100th anniversary of its
founding. While outsiders fail to recognise this grouping as the power-house
of Swiss politics - it has been in government for 50 years, thanks to its
rigorous rejection of radicalism and internal democracy - Weltwoche marked
the centenary by interviewing Urs Altermatt who is, in fact, a historian
rather than a ski resort.
The first question conveys the unique nature of Swiss political discourse:
'Does not the Radical-Democratic party pretend, no doubt for reasons of
coquetry, to be younger than it really is?' Suddenly, the foreign reader is
floundering in an exotic, even incomprehensible, political landscape. How do
the lush fronds of political seduction blossom in alpine valleys?
This lengthy introduction is necessary so as not to deter those who may fear
that this year's trip through the columns of the Neue Zurcher Zeitung will
be as dull as they believe Switzerland to be. (A reputation promoted
sedulously by the French and, even more so, by the British.)
It is believed widely in the country that the NZZ once ran a piece
headlined: 'One hundred years of the electric light in Switzerland' as a
lead story - although this could not happen because the paper never runs
Swiss stories on its front page, except for referendum results. It was, in
fact, the top news feature on the paper's domestic pages.
Lead stories in the Neue Zurcher are, therefore, unpredictable. Last
weekend, most of the front page consisted of a piece entitled: 'Great
Britain - European and global.' It opened with the words: 'Without Germany
and France, European union is unthinkable,' and ended with: 'European union
in a deeper sense is today unthinkable without the critical, intensive
participation of the UK in Brussels.'
The conclusion was that Britain served even the smaller nations thanks to
its outward-looking policies. This compliment, argued with a wealth of
detail and backed by a fund of knowledge, is based partly on the observation
that the British civil service is 'schooled in a global dimension'.
After the re-opening of the Euro-split at the Tory party's annual conference
in Bournemouth this week, the NZZ's view gains an added significance.
True sceptics, such as Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the
exchequer, can hope to wreck any chance of European unity by promoting a
British withdrawal. It is a long time since the cry 'they can't do it
without us' has echoed through Whitehall.
Turning the page of the Neue Zurcher, you find two columns on the Labour
party conference, which had just ended. It was another interesting piece
about what might be deemed a sort of British achievement: Tony Blair's
campaign to turn Labour into a modern party in a way that its last leader,
John Smith, never imagined. It ended with a warning to Blair: 'He has only
to protect himself against being mistaken for a Tory.'
Working through the paper, you come across a memoir of the day 50 years
earlier 'when the second world war came to Basle'. The allies had bombed
some sluices on the Rhine and threatened the Swiss town with flooding. There
was also an article headlined, intriguingly: 'Are the people to blame for
everything?' That was about the crisis of confidence in politics and the
system.
The domestic news was dominated by a whole page devoted to the problems
faced by au pair girls in Switzerland. One had never assumed there were such
beings, for they must represent a coals-to-Newcastle situation. It turns out
there are thousands from Scandinavia and France who go to the country to
learn German.
Still, the existence of widespread homesickness among the au pair sorority
has led to the formation of a club that sounds irresistibly attractive - the
Swiss Association of Girlfriends of Young Girls.
This might provide the answer to Groucho Marx's prayer, for such a club
would have to reject anyone who really wanted to join. Apart from au pairs.
Switzerland might not actually be a product of radicalism but it is
different. A couple of weeks ago, I listened to a conversation between a
colleague who had once worked in Berne and a leading Swiss journalist. Both
insisted, to my incredulity, that Switzerland can be a marvellously
interesting country full of interesting people. I begin to see what they
mean.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Lonely seas and the sky: Charles Batchelor samples life
aboard a coastal tanker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a calm evening and Agility, a small coastal tanker, is barely a mile
out of the shelter of Milford Haven. Out of the lee of the land, the bow
dips suddenly into the waves and the deck of the 3,100 tonne vessel is
awash.
Agility is far too neat a ship to be compared with that 'dirty British
coaster with a salt-caked smoke stack'. But John Masefield's poem comes to
mind as we butt into the rising Atlantic swell off the south-west coast of
Wales.
Agility is one of a fleet of 28 coasters - tankers and dry bulk carriers -
owned or managed by family shipping company FT Everard &amp; Sons.
It normally carries oil cargoes up and down the east coast of England but
for the past week or so she has been brought over to the west coast of Wales
because her sister ship, Alacrity, is laid up for repairs.
Tying up in Milford Haven at 5.30am on a Monday morning Captain Keith
Reading had hoped to start loading his cargo of 1,700 tonnes of gas oil and
kerosene immediately.
But a fault with the pump which injects a liquid dye into the kerosene -
required by Customs &amp; Excise to show the product is duty-free - has delayed
the start of operations. In the old days a Customs officer would have poured
a bucket of the dye into the tank and relied on the motion of the ship to
mix it in. But the requirements are now much stiffer and the pump must be
repaired.
It is not until 11.30am that loading can start. The whole of a sunlit day
then passes with the first mate tending his pumps and checking a bank of
dials to ensure that all goes according to plan.
Twenty years ago a vessel the size of Alacrity would have had a crew of 15.
But intense competition in the shipping industry has forced owners to reduce
manning levels, employ foreign crews and register their vessels with flags
of convenience. Captain Reading has just seven men under his command though
Everard ships still employ British crews and fly the red ensign.
With luxuries such as stewards and galley boys ancient history, deck duties
have to be shared and juggling the watches is a constant problem. But the
smallness of the crew makes for greater informality and the officers and
crew now mess together.
Across the bay, the town of Milford Haven is visible. But tankers are not
welcome close to other human activities in most ports and Agility is moored
at the end of a half-mile long jetty.
'It's a lonely life,' says Reading. 'We don't get off a great deal.' Any
idea that the entire crew spends nights out carousing on the town is soon
dispelled.
Ports such as Ipswich and Poole, where even oil tankers can tie up close to
the town, are a welcome relief from bleaker oil terminals, such as Teesport
or Peterhead, where a convivial evening out can be a Pounds 12 taxi ride
away.
The isolation of the crews from conventional shore life is increased by the
pattern of their tours of duty. Everard crews spend 10 weeks on and five
weeks off.
'It doesn't get any better with time,' says Reading, 47, who has a wife and
two children at home in Epsom, Surrey. 'It takes longer to get into home
life and it is more difficult to leave at the end. It's an anti-social
existence.'
So why do people go to sea? Reading says his father put him down for sea
training school and it seemed natural to join the merchant navy.
He obtained his master's ticket at the early age of 26 and went on to work
for many of the well-known names of British shipping, such as Rowbotham and
North British Shipping. 'I was a master very young, earning a lot of money,'
says Reading. 'It has given me a reasonable life style.'
Reading has spent nearly a quarter of a century at sea but 20-year-old Nigel
McKinstrey, the trainee on Agility, is at the start of his career.
McKinstrey has spent the past two years at sea and in February takes the
exams which, he hopes, will gain him his second mate's ticket.
He, too, compares favourably the money he can earn at sea with what he could
get ashore. McKinstrey says he is happy to work on coasters and is not
attracted to deep sea routes. But the lure of exotic destinations is often a
cause of rapid crew turnover on the coastal trades. 'I keep losing second
mates, mostly for the deep sea,' says Reading.
On this trip, Agility's destination is Belfast, a steady 20 hours' sailing
at a speed of 11 1/2 knots (13mph). As darkness falls, the ship's radar
picks up several ships heading into Milford Haven.
Built in 1990 at the Lowestoft yard of Richards (Shipbuilders), Agility has
self-steering gear which takes account of currents and the wind and means
that much of the voyage can be completed on an automatic setting. Captain
Reading makes adjustments to the course by means of a hand-held device no
larger than the remote control handset you use to change channels on a TV
set. The closest the Agility comes to a traditional ships 'wheel' is a small
metal fold-away helm which can be used in emergencies.
Reading settles down to the first watch which will take the Agility round
the south-west tip of Wales and up into the calmer waters of the Irish Sea.
The regular noises of the sea and ship's engines are broken every few
minutes by the warning tone of the 'dead man's handle'. This will sound an
alarm in the crew's quarters if the helmsman does not respond by pressing a
button.
First light reveals a calm sea and a low-lying mist which soon burns off.
The tomato plants which Captain Reading is growing on his bridge appear set
to enjoy another day in the sun. Agility is out of sight of land but away to
the east is Anglesey while to our west are the Wicklow Mountains.
At quiet times like this there is usually at least one member of the crew
engaged in the permanent task of painting the vessel. The corrosive effects
of the sea and the wind can only be combated by constant activity with the
paint brush.
The breaks in the crew's duties are filled with television, videos and
reading. The port agent is their regular source of contact with land,
bringing on mail and the day's newspapers. The men spend their spare time
either in the small dining cum recreation room or in their surprisingly
roomy cabins.
As Agility steams north she threads between fleets of fishing vessels while
her bows provide a resting place for the occasional passing seagull. Away to
port the Irish coastline emerges from the haze and as the afternoon wears on
we near our destination.
As we head into Belfast Lough, Reading radios for a pilot to come on board.
Masters can gain 'exemptions', meaning they can dispense with a pilot,
saving fees of Pounds 1,000 and more, when they are regular visitors to a
port. Reading has kept up his exemption for Milford Haven but it has lapsed
for Belfast.
As we enter the line of buoys leading into the harbour the pilot cutter
rushes up and the pilot steps aboard. Under his guidance we continue down
the dredged channel, squeezing past a grimy Polish tanker 10 times our size.
It is 5pm by the time we finally tie up at the small oil terminal and the
main engine is switched off. The first mate assembles the crew and a cluster
of shore hands to start pumping our cargo ashore. A steady 12 hours work lie
ahead before Agility's tanks have been pumped dry and cleaned. By morning
she will be ready to set sail again.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Portugal rings the changes - Wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like most of my colleagues, I am sent an average of between one and two
dozen unsolicited bottles of wine a week. To avoid any suggestion of payola,
I could refuse them all, but anyone who thinks I can be bought with a
selection of supermarket vins de pays (a typical consignment) is welcome to
their misapprehension.
Ungraciously, we wine writers tend to take for granted these packages, the
liquid equivalent of review copies to literary critics. Extremely few of
them are positively welcomed in this household. I do try to taste the top
centimetre of every bottle but stubbornly tend to drink wines I have chosen
and bought myself.
On the other hand, only packages heralded by a call from an airport handling
agent are cursed; we usually have to pay duty and sometimes storage charges
for these.
I recently paid Pounds 40 and spent more than an hour unravelling a
completely unasked-for consignment of wine from Argentina, each bottle
swaddled in layer after layer of newspaper, cardboard and sellotape,
cushioned by horribly clinging little polystyrene particles. Half the
bottles turned out to be duplicates, and it eventually transpired that their
sender simply wanted to show me the redesigned labels.
The other day I thought I had found the wine bargain of all time. I opened a
bottle of Portuguese red which had been sent to me out of the blue. Most
bottles are accompanied by some sort of explanation, or more usually eulogy.
This one arrived clueless, except for the particularly downmarket-looking
label carrying a theoretically second-rank denomination, Vinho Regio do
Alentejo, a region in southern Portugal so far better known for cork and
cereals than for wine.
I opened it early one evening, my usual tasting time, and did a double-take,
scribbling deliriously 'Very, very deep colour. Intense and exciting. Nervy
and concentrated in a Penfolds Grange sort of way] Lovely and rich. American
oak? Very, very ripe. Lots of tannins but masses of fruit too.'
Grange is Australia's most lauded wine, the new 1989 vintage has just been
offered by selected Oddbins stores for about Pounds 45 a bottle. This
Portuguese wine, on the other hand, looked as though it should sell for
Pounds 4.50 at most. Unusually, we savoured every mouthful from the mystery
bottle with our supper.
Many a phone call later, I finally tracked down this marvellous liquid,
called Mouchao after the small Anglo-Portuguese farm on which it is
produced. It is made mainly from low-yielding Alicante Bouschet vines, not
one of the vine world's most aristocratic members, with local Periquita and
Moreto grapes.
The grapes are still trodden, in a relatively primitive winery that until
recently had no electricity. The wine is then apparently matured for five or
more years in old oak casks, so before it is subjected to this generally
enervating experience, it must be a truly incredible hulk.
This recipe does not sound cheap, does it? In fact, in spite of the low rent
label, it costs more than Pounds 10 - Pounds 10.95 from Winos of Oldham,
Lancs; Pounds 11.99 from Sherston of St Albans, Herts; Pounds 14.99 from La
Vigneronne of London SW7; and an as-yet-uncalculated price from Gauntleys,
of Nottingham.
Even at Pounds 14.99 it is a good buy for those who admire Grange, Spain's
Vega Sicilia and, Portugal's most famous 'expensive' wine, Ferreira's Barca
Velha (the 1985 is Pounds 24.99 from Oddbins).
There will be no Mouchao 1994; the entire production was destroyed by frost.
Thanks to poor flowering and drought the whole Portuguese wine harvest will
be short this year, which is a pity since Portugal has become one of the
potentially most exciting sources of red wine value.
For long a lone Australian called Peter Bright kept sending us exciting
smoke signals and keenly- priced bottles of essentially Portuguese wines.
During the last year or two, however, he has been joined by increasing
numbers of similarly skilled winemakers.
David Baverstock, for example, is a refugee from port country and was one of
the first to realise that the Douro can also produce some stunning
unfortified reds. He is now doing good things at Esporao in Alentejo (see
Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up selections), funded by a well-heeled
Portuguese businessman.
And an increasing number of co-operatives and estates can offer such
keenly-priced, characterful red blends as Falua 1993 (Pounds 2.99 Safeway)
and Leziria (around Pounds 2.50 from Kwiksave, Oddbins, Somerfield and
Victoria Wine), both from Portugal's farming heartland Ribatejo.
Bright's brightest sparks, especially as far as British wine buyers were
concerned, were his full, sweet and vibrant oaked Alentejo blend Tinta da
Anfora and the oaky Cabernet Quinta da Bacalhoa from the Setubal peninsula,
but 1992 was the last vintage under his control.
The 1990 vintages of these two wines are currently available. Tinta da
Anfora is Pounds 4.79 at Tesco, Pounds 4.95 at Waitrose and Pounds 4.99 at
Safeway while Quinta da Bacalhoa is Pounds 5.99 from Sainsbury's and
Majestic.
They should be snapped up now for they will continue to age over the next
five years at least.
Bright has struck out on his own, allowing himself to become yet another
flying winemaker, in Iberia, South America and Sicily (notably making
international varietals for Sainsbury's), rather than concentrating on
bringing Portuguese flavours to a wider wine drinking public.
Shame - although look out for Bright Brothers wines from Bairrada, Ribatejo
and Douro (the latter from Thresher).
Enthusiasts for Portugal's unique combination of ripe fruit and Atlantic
influence will be able to continue, however, to follow vintages of Quinta de
Camarate, whose 1989 (Pounds 4.89 at Victoria Wine) is showing particularly
well now, being full-bodied, lively and packed with fruit, most of it
incontravertibly Portuguese rather than 'international'.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Sexual equality and the stockpot - A look at
an association formed to promulgate Women Chefs and Restaurateurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first, fondest and often longest-lasting memories of good food are often
associated with women who cook. Perhaps mother's home-cooked lunches,
grandmother's teatime baking treats or visits to the kitchen of that
vanishing species, the domestic cook. In all cases the image is strong:
women provide nourishing, comforting and satisfying food.
It is an image that the restaurant industry has failed to perpetuate.
Virtually since restaurants came into existence kitchens have been organised
on hierarchical lines with limited opportunities for women. It was often
argued that women could not lift heavy stockpots and kitchen equipment and
needed too much time off to raise families. (There were exceptions.
Elizabeth David wrote poetically of the food prepared by Madame Baraterro at
the Hotel du Midi, Lamastre, and of the elegant and seemingly effortless
cooking of La Mere Brazier, in Lyons.)
At last attitudes are changing. The number of women in the restaurant
industry has been increasing steadily and America's leading women chefs and
restaurateurs have formed an international association to promote their
cause.
In San Francisco, I met two of the founders, Barbara Tropp, chef/proprietor
of China Moon, and Joyce Goldstein, of Square One. Both run restaurants
which are highly regarded and well-established.
The first point that Tropp and Goldstein wanted to emphasise was that the
association was not an antagonistic one. They believe, having run busy,
successful restaurants for more than a decade, that the biggest problem the
industry faces - staffing - cannot be overcome except by a concerted, more
sympathetic, perhaps more intuitive approach.
The industry has been expanding rapidly. So how, when working under constant
pressure in shifts incompatible with social and family life, can new staff
be trained, encouraged and kept? Tropp and Goldstein think restaurants must
make themselves more welcoming to young women and make chefs more aware of
sexual equality.
As an example, Goldstein cited a chef she worked with closely. His cooking
could not be faulted but his attitude towards female chefs of equal status
was such that he upset the entire brigade, male and female.
While the association plans to foster better industrial relations and
encourage new recruits it also has a hard, commercial edge. On its board sit
several women who have created their own culinary empires in the tough
restaurant world: Barbara Lazaroff, who designed the Wolfgang Puck
restaurants; Anne Rosenzweig, of Arcadia, New York and Elka Gilmore,
chef/proprietor of Elka and Liberte in San Francisco.
Potential members on the opposite side of the Atlantic include: Ghislaine
Arabian, a Michelin-starred chef at Ledoyen, Paris; Gunn Eriksen of the
Altnaharrie Inn, Scotland; and Sonya Kidney, who has made the Marsh Goose in
the Cotswolds so successful.
The association holds seminars to make prospective female chefs and
restaurateurs more aware of the financial problems they will face. Both
Goldstein and Tropp confessed to mistakes they hoped others would avoid.
'Next to the restaurant at Square One,' Goldstein explained, 'we used to run
a sandwich shop. It was busy all day, fun - everyone enjoyed it. Then after
three years I sat down and analysed the figures. I realised that in spite of
all the hard work, this shop made nothing. Not a cent. We closed it
immediately and converted the area into a larger bar and a private dining
area which is more profitable and provides a specific service to our
customers.'
The initial idea for forming the association came to Tropp in 1991 after she
had been invited to join 11 other female chefs to cook at the Lincoln
Centre, New York.
Although thrilled to be there she vowed that this would be the last time
that female chefs would be treated as 'frilly bloomers on a laundry line'.
For Tropp, an invaluable insight into the economics of her business came
when she was married. 'I realised that my former working life - 12 hours a
day, seven days a week - would not be compatible with a lasting marriage. At
the time, my restaurant was open lunch and dinner and I decided that the
only solution was to close for lunch. This led to a 50 per cent reduction in
the payroll but, to my surprise, only a 20 per cent reduction in revenue.
And, naturally, it has meant a much more relaxed chef.'
Seminars have already borne fruit. In Austin, Texas, recently, 85 women
gathered to hear a panel discussion on 'Women, Motivation and Mentors in the
Restaurant Industry'. In the audience was a mother and her new baby. The
mother, a former pastry chef, had thought of leaving the industry but, armed
with information and support from the association, decided to open her own
cafe - aided by her mother.
Given the international recognition that so many female chefs around the
world have earned it is unlikely that future women chefs will be treated as
a phenomenon. They are more likely to follow the example of George Lang,
proprietor of Cafe des Artistes in Manhattan. Having resuscitated Gundel,
Budapest's legendary restaurant, he has now renovated Bagolyvar (Owl's
Castle) with Emma Tomos, who was taught to cook by her mother and
grandmother, as chef and a staff of 25 women.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Perfect grains of eastern promise - Philippa
Davenport takes a two-part look at rice and its status as a prized delicacy
in Iran
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Patna, basmati, arborio and Japan or pudding rice are known to most of us.
Real rice enthusiasts may also be familiar with carnaroli, vialone nano,
Thai fragrant and the red rice of Carmague. I doubt, though, that many have
tucked into ambarboo, darbari or dom siah.
This last trio comes from Iran, a country where I had imagined rice to be a
basic everyday food, on a par with the potato in England. Not so. Bread is
Iran's starchy staple. Rice is a prized delicacy, food for the rich, for
special celebrations and for serving to guests.
'It has always been cherished as the most festive of foods. At No Rooz, the
Iranian new year on March 21, it is eaten by even the very poorest. Indeed,
this is often the only time of year when the villagers of the high central
plateau will dine on rice.' So I was told by Margaret Shaida, a journalist
and historian born in Oxfordshire, who married an Iranian and lived in her
husband's homeland for 25 years.
Shaida's interest in the food and cookery of Iran, gleaned at first from her
in-laws and subsequently from her own considerable research, grew so
passionate that she eventually wrote and published The Legendary Cuisine of
Persia. A jewel of a book, rich in history and heady with aromatic perfumes,
it won her a Glenfiddich food book award and is shortly to be published in
paperback.
Shaida told me how she had been inducted into the rituals of choosing and
buying rice by her mother-in-law. At the end of holidays spent in the
relative cool of the Caspian coast, where most of Iran's rice is grown, the
two women went to call on the family's rice merchant.
After initial formalities and refreshments, hands were dipped deep into
sacks and the grain withdrawn was examined. A starchy smell indicates age,
she was taught. The grains gradually become drier, more dusty and brittle.
The tapering points may break off. Rice remains good for up to two years
after harvest, then it deteriorates.
Back at home her mother-in-law would test a batch from each sack to
ascertain the soaking and cooking times needed. Salt was added to the sacks
to reduce the risk of attack from mice or weevils in storage, and broken
grains were sifted out, their imperfection marking them down as suitable
only for soup-making.
Practically all the rice grown in Iran is consumed there. Darbari, produced
solely on the Shah's plantations, probably does not exist any more, says
Shaida.
Ambarboo, the long pointed grains of which possess the fragrance of amber,
is another exclusive estate-grown rice and very expensive. A little dom siah
is occasionally exported. Snap it up if it is fresh, Shaida advises.
Otherwise, for Iranian cookery she recommends good basmati rice such as that
sold under the Tilda label.
Perhaps it is precisely because rice is not a staple, but food for special
occasions, that so much care is taken in Iran over choosing cooking and
presenting it.
Most of us grab, unquestioningly, any old packet from the deli or
supermarket shelf. And we tend to rely on the absorption cooking method,
either dropping rice into double its volume of boiling liquid, or stirring
in the liquid gradually for risotto or paella.
The Iranian way is more painstaking and involves several steps. The rice is
washed and soaked at length in salted water. Then it is parboiled, drained
gently, transferred to a well-oiled container and steamed to perfect
tenderness.
There are two main forms of presentation. The rice may be served in a mound
of free-flowing grains surrounded by pieces of tahdeeg (the crust from the
bottom of the pan, regarded as the ultimate proof of a cook's ability to
cook rice well).
Or the rice may be steamed not in a saucepan on top of the stove but in a
mould in the oven. In this case it is baked until crusted with gold all
over, then turned out for serving.
Iranian rice dishes are nearly always composite, in other words the grain is
laced or layered with other ingredients. What is remarkable is that the
individual character of each component remains distinct - each beautifully
foiled by the other(s), not reduced to a blurry blend.
As befits festive food, finishing touches are sometimes extravagant: the
rice may be garnished with jewel-bright fruits, choice nuts, saffron or spun
sugar.
Shaida cooked one rice dish of each sort for me to sample. Both were
exquisite, simultaneously simple and sophisticated.
First there was a mound of rice with lentils, a leaden sounding combination
if ever I heard one. In practice it was delicate and lovely  - a revelation.
The lentils were judiciously few. Grey-green tinged with pink, scattered
through the rice, they tasted mealy and peppery, while each grain of the
white, fragrant rice tasted of itself.
The dish was decorated with a trickle of brilliant yellow saffron rice, a
ladleful of the freshly steamed grain being stirred into a few spoonfuls of
intense tincture of saffron. Quite different from European saffron rice
dishes, in which the whole potful is irrevocably flavoured and stained with
the spice, here the aroma and flavour of plain white and saffron grains
could be enjoyed jointly and separately.
Side dishes included sticky dates and a bowl of fried onions unlike any I
had ever eaten. They were the colour of mahogany, sweetly caramelised,
rustling like autumn leaves and incredibly digestible.
Many variations on this splendid polow are given in Shaida's book including
one made with almonds, pistachios and pinenuts, said to be a traditional
favourite of pearl divers, and another rife with fresh herbs (three parts of
herbs to four parts of rice) with which to celebrate spring.
The second dish Shaida cooked for me - an elegantly striped and moulded rice
recipe - is equally delicious but since it is fairly lengthy I will give the
details next week.
The Legendary Cuisine of Persia by Margaret Shaida is due to be published by
Penguin (Pounds 12) on November 3.
A good selection of Iranian produce is available from Super Bahar, 349A
Kensington High Street, London W8.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: Popular Purcell - The Wigmore is getting in early on
tercentenary celebrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was the Mozart bicentenary that started the problem. There were countless
new opera productions, complete cycles of the symphonies and concertos, in
New York even the complete everything: so much Mozart was on offer that
audiences were sated by the middle of the year.
In the eyes of concert promoters the answer is to get in early. So keen were
they to mark the centenary of Tchaikovsky's death that almost everything was
over before the anniversary year arrived. For Purcell's tercentenary -
official date 1995 - there is no need to wait. Sundry interesting events
have already happened, such as a full stage production of The Indian Queen
(don't worry - there are others to come) and the autumn looks as if it will
be resounding to Purcell all round the country.
The Wigmore Hall's tercentenary festival began on Thursday. William Lyne,
the hall's director, had been doubtful as to whether nine evenings of
Purcell might be too much for a Wigmore audience nourished on a steady diet
of Schubert songs and Beethoven quartets, but he need not have worried. The
seats quickly sold out, showing that strong marketing plus a smattering of
well-known artists (Barbara Bonney and Anne Sofie von Otter among them) can
be enough to draw the Wigmore regulars.
The festival is under the directorship of Robert King, who has virtually
turned Purcell into a one-man business. Listen to the concert, read his
notes in the programme, then on the way out buy the book and recordings. It
was shameful how much of Purcell's output was still waiting to be recorded
even ten years ago and credit is due to King and the record company Hyperion
for spotting such an important and worthwhile opportunity.
For the last couple of years they have been engaged on the major undertaking
of recording all Purcell's anthems and services, together with a short
series of the secular solo songs. Before that, they had recorded the odes
and welcome songs, two of which were featured on Thursday. The ode called
'Celebrate this festival' must have chosen itself, not just for the title,
but also for the quality of its music.
The penultimate stanza is pure Purcell: a high tenor urges an end to
thoughts of war, accompanied by two plaintive recorders, but within minutes
the mood has changed and the choir is wittily tossing back and forth the
words 'repeat Maria's name', like an echo bouncing from one wall to another.
It is a young man's music, quick with ideas, full of restless imagination.
The pity is that a young man's music is all we have from Purcell, who died
at the age of 36.
The King's Consort has never sounded better than it did here at the Wigmore
Hall, which suits King's brand of relaxed, warm music-making. There was some
good singing, notably from Susan Gritton and the pair of counter-tenors,
James Bowman and Robin Blaze, who drew the celebrated duet 'Sound the
trumpet' in place of the high tenors that some scholars now regard as more
authentic. If the Wigmore is wishing it had booked up more Purcell, there is
still all of 1995 to go.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: The angry wasp of Victorian painting - A look at a
landmark exhibition of the work of the artist James McNeill Whistler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
James Whistler - expatriate American, protege of Courbet, friend of Degas,
verbal sparring partner of Oscar Wilde, open enemy of anyone who, like
Sickert, crossed his path - still enjoys a reputation that buzzes through
the anecdotal cultural life of late Victorian London like an angry wasp. He
has always been recognised as a true and original artist, at least by other
artists. Yet this full retrospective of his work is, we learn, the first
since the international memorial shows of 1905, some two years after his
death. It is, one feels, somewhat overdue.
But then criticism has always had trouble with the maverick, always so
difficult to put and keep in place. Whistler endured its hostility in his
lifetime, and his mistake, perhaps, was to return like with like, devoting
months at a time to literary skirmishing that had been better spent leaving
the work to speak for itself. The name he thus made for himself as a
posturing self-publicist haunts his reputation still. Not for the first
time, the biography gets in the way of the true achievement.
Yet Whistler would not have been Whistler had he not sailed into battle,
courageous and alone to defend his cause, for he lived for his art. And his
famous libel suit of 1878 against John Ruskin, beyond all the legal fun and
repartee, had a most serious point to it. For Ruskin, in accusing him of
'flinging a pot of paint in the public's face', was accusing him of much
more than mere charlatanry: he was saying that here was art that had no
moral base, and no moral purpose to uplift and improve. To Whistler, the
first article of faith was that art was art, to be judged and accepted in
terms of art alone.
'Art for Art's sake' aestheticism may well now seem an empty concept, but
the principle remains. In freeing painting, not from the possibility, but
from the duty of narrative, finish, accurate representation and all the
other false imperatives that Victorian criticism wished upon it, Whistler
established a position which every modern artist since has been happy to
exploit.
To the question put by Ruskin's counsel: 'Do you say that this is a correct
representation of Battersea Bridge?', Whistler replied: 'I did not intend it
to be a correct portrait of the bridge. It is only a moonlight scene . . .As
to what the picture represents, that depends upon who looks at it . . . My
whole scheme was to bring about a certain harmony of colour.'
This 'Nocturne: Blue and Gold - Old Battersea Bridge' hangs in the room full
of 'nocturnes' that is the true heart of this exhibition, with the painting
that gave Ruskin such offence, 'Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling
Rocket' of 1875, given a wall to itself. It is a magnificent thing, as
exquisitely effected and perfectly judged as the rest of them, with
fireworks bursting, rising and falling over the deep shadows of the old
pleasure gardens at Cremorne. We see clearly now why Whistler should have
won his case, which he did to the tune of a farthing in damages, which he
put on his watch-chain, and no costs. He was bankrupted by it.
The puzzle is only that he continued to live in London through the last 20
years of his increasingly embittered life. He knew Paris well, was friends
with his great contemporaries among the French painters, most especially
Degas and Fantin-Latour. But perhaps it was the very isolation, embattled
against the philistine, that was necessary to his combative temperament.
Perhaps he felt himself, au fond, too close to Degas, to Manet, and the line
that went back to his hero, Velasquez. He needed, perhaps, to feel alone.
The otherwise estimable authors of this exhibition, Margaret MacDonald and
Richard Dorment, draw a distinction between the 'French' method of the
Impressionists, the paint thick and applied direct, and the 'English' method
of Whistler, thin paint and lots of glazes. This accounts, so they say, for
much of the subsequent misunderstanding and fall in reputation of the work.
But it is nonsense. Glazing was quite as much a French as an English
academic technique and is in any case a natural function of the use of thin
paint. Certainly it is to be found in the work of such supposed
Impressionists as Degas and Lautrec.
The most intriguing room in the show is indeed the one that marks Whistler's
move, in the later 1860s, from the more fully-realised subjects by which he
first made a name - the 'Symphonies in White' with their 'White Girls' and
thicker paint - to the more loosely and lightly-stated figure compositions
and studies, with their Japanese references and open interest in the painted
mark as a thing of itself. The step from them to the sea paintings, to the
'nocturnes' and the Venice pastels, and to the etchings with their radical
experiments in the subtle wiping of the plates, was not so far to take.
This is a magnificent exhibition, a true landmark. It brings us great works
that we shall never see together again, not just the 'nocturnes' but the
'White Girls', the notorious 'Arrangements' that are the portraits of Thomas
Carlyle and Whistler's mother, and so many of the prints and drawings over
which the artist's hand dances like the butterfly by which he signed
himself. But it is the artist who is the hero, the artist now seen whole and
vindicated.
Sickert, hurt by their last quarrel, could seldom resist a posthumous jibe,
but respect and affection for his old master would always creep in. He
perhaps should have the last word. 'The beauty of Whistler's painting is
that he achieved its form purely by relations considered as opaque, between
a restricted number of tones. This is not only extremely difficult, but . .
. it is so rare that only the great painters can do it.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: Uchida's Schubert and Schoenberg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Programming those two great Viennese composers Schubert and Schoenberg
together, which might have seemed an odd thing to do, at best a worthy ruse
for securing listeners to the modernist, actually felt inevitable and right
in the first, last Thursday, of Mitsuko Uchida's three such piano recitals
at Queen Elizabeth Hall.
A more antithetical pair it would be hard, in many respects, to name.
Whereas Schubert's music, particularly in his piano sonatas - of which
Uchida is giving six - is renowned for its generous spread of events, its
sublime spaciousness, profound repetitiousness, what Schumann (thinking of
the ninth symphony) called its 'heavenly length', Schoenberg's music is
always crammed with incident, intensely compressed - never more so than in
the Six Little Piano Pieces, Op. 19, which we heard - but nonetheless
bursting at every seam, avoiding repetition and anything much like ease.
On the other hand, the two composers are involved in the same classical
tradition and concerned with resolving essentially the same problems of form
and content. Extremes of brevity and length look suspiciously like different
sides of the same coin, and so it proved in Uchida's fabulously sensitive
and accomplished projection of both their idioms.
I have seldom if ever heard such wonderful Schubert playing as in her
account of the two movements he completed of the so-called Reliquie sonata
in C major D840. To the 'late', even other-worldly manner of the writing
here she brought a wise serenity, a limpid lyrical poise which did not
exclude some briefly feral climaxes, but contained them, indeed, with
perfect shapeliness.
Her spacious ease - the first movement's Moderato tempo was beautifully
judged - never lacked for interest and dramatic surprise; and how subtly and
poignantly she voiced that curiously dissonant chord that recurs in the
first movement and that no less jolting turn of the harmony that is a
feature of the C minor Andante.
Such moments of 'advanced' harmony made a satisfying and instructive link to
the next item, Schoenberg's Three Piano Pieces, Op. 11, for which a
free-floating harmony provides the structural and expressive base. Uchida
showed how glintingly lyrical the music can be, how richly it invites
plasticity of phrasing, how full it is of dynamic nuance, in short, how
close to her Schubert - an impression clinched by her again feral way with
the furious outbursts of the third piece.
The fast fourth, very tiny, of the Six Little Pieces was despatched with
pure savagery, but the strange chords of the static sixth had the eerie
expressionistic glow of a painting by Kandinsky or Schoenberg himself.
The return to Schubert was exhilarating and moving, and if Uchida's reading
of the C minor sonata D958 did not, for me, have the perfected intensity of
her earlier sonata, there was no disputing the hefty grandeur of its outer
movements or the meditative, lyrical warmth of the Adagio. The series
promises to be superb.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: Smiles, sambas and psychotic behaviour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to know quite what to make of the Brazilian Grupo Corpo,
installed this week at Sadler's Wells. It looks like the product of a Jekyll
and Hyde experiment in some remote part of the Amazon. Just before curtain
rise the members of a dance troupe drink a potion and proceed to scare the
living daylights out of an audience with a display of ferocious tosh, while
giving a Mozart Mass a thorough going-over. But the dancers return after the
interval, all smiles and samba rhythms, to win us with charm and pretty
dances. It is psychotic behaviour of the most inexplicable kind.
So I interpreted the events of Wednesday evening. The company is nearly 20
years old, and was seen briefly with Dance Umbrella here a decade ago. Its
founder-choreographer is Rodrigo Pederneiras, and it is he who gives the
troupe its split-personality. His Orphanage Mass is a capoeira attack on
Mozart, feet flying, the music knocked for six.
Curtain-rise brings a view of men and women, dingily clad, lurching in a
curious high-shouldered gait towards one of those backdrops of eroded
masonry that would make any self-respecting surveyor tell you of 'very
serious problems with rising damp'. More serious is the fact that we are in
Kylian-country, where the angst is high as an elephant's eye, and no good
will come of anything. Nor does it. The cast look like inmates of a home for
the criminally insane, and behave thus. Wild activity from women in those
long suicidal frocks that are de rigueur in films about institutional life.
The men wear sack suits and blank expressions, and rampage. Life is very
fraught.
Pederneiras has a few anxious movement ideas, which he tacks onto Mozart,
though musical form and the matters of a sacred text go largely unregarded.
I suppose if your idea of spectator sport is visiting a mad-house, then the
piece has a certain allure. I thought it an interminable, flailing bore, in
which the cast unleashed megatons of energetic gloom. At the interval, I was
ready for hemlock.
But the sun does come out. Pederneiras' second piece in the programme is
Nazareth - not, happily, another exercise in religiosity, but a tribute to
Ernesto Nazareth, composer of a legion of delightful salon pieces. These
have been brilliantly re-worked by Jose Miguel Wisnik, put in a mixer,
re-shaped, and orchestrated with tremendous wit. The rhythm is that of the
maxixe, best known in the 1920 but intoxicating still. The dancers look
handsome, amusing, alert. The dances, somewhat repetitive, keep then on the
jolly hop and explore social and folk-movement attitudes very neatly. It is
merry, if over-long, and the dancers (clearly well-trained) have tremendous
fun embroidering samba steps and playing with the wonderful rhythms of the
score. The setting, of 14 large fabric roses, excellently lit, is beautiful,
and by Fernando Velloso. Hyde has been vanquished.

The chief aim of the three Sitwell siblings - Edith, Sacheverell and Osbert
 -was, according to Aldous Huxley, 'to REBEL'. But, he added, 'though a
charming idea, the steps which they are prepared to take are so small as to
be hardly perceptible.' The National Portrait Gallery's new exhibition and
accompanying catalogue (Pounds 14.95 pbk, Pounds 19.95 hbk, 240 pages)
chronicles in paintings, photographs, music, literature and letters the
Sitwell's influence in the arts of the early 20th century and leaves us
lamenting the decline of the Great English Eccentric.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: On the wave of controversy - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a publicist was required to use one and the same adjective on every film,
which would he choose? Would it be one of the rabble-rousers like 'Sexy,'
'Torrid' or 'Violent'? Would it a value judgment like 'Brilliant' or
'Unmissable'? Or would it be that word that answers every copywriter's
prayer: 'Controversial.'
This epithet has everything. It hints at sex or violence, or something
equally inflammatory; it suggests that you will be stirred, if not to
outrage, at least to deep and reverberant thoughts.
But for controversy you need an arena. After years spent shuttling between
private video parlour and public cinema, I realise that the main difference
between the two venues is not big room versus small room; or viewer control
versus passive spectacle; or even cheap versus expensive. The main
difference is 'controversy'. You get it in one release context, not in the
other.
Take this month's videos. They include In The Name Of The Father, Jim
Sheridan's film about the the Guildford Four and the Brits in Ireland, with
Daniel Day Lewis chewing the scenery as scapegoat-martyr Gerry Conlon;
Claire Devers' Noir Et Blanc, an eerie French study of sado-machism,
involving two bodybuilders who work out, in all senses, on each's bodies;
and Philadelphia, bringing together Aids, lawsuits and Oscar-winning Tom
Hanks.
All these are worth (re-)viewing on the VCR. And all three were significant
stirrers-up when they hit the big screen.
But in the second-time-around world of video reissue - and the fanfare-free
intimacy of domestic viewing - what happens to their potential for
controversy? Unlike a new TV programme, a Cathy Come Home or Death On The
Rock, a 'new' video will not set a hundred newspaper columnists alight. It
did that before as a movie. And although statistically most people watching
a film on video are seeing it the first time, the public furore, if there
was one, blew out months before.
So what does this do to the culture? In one sense it is no different than
the book world's time-lag between hardcover exposure and mass circulation in
paperback. Latest Amis or Deighton? Thank you: we will wait till the price
halves.
But reading is a private activity; has been ever since Homer. Moviegoing is
a group-friendly pastime, and video not only shrinks the group to three or
two or one, it turns the viewing context into a low-tide littoral where the
wave of debate broke and receded weeks or months before.
As a film critic I want to cry 'Get out to those first-run cinemas, so you
can catch the tide of controversy.' As a video critic, I have sympathy with
those who want an easier, more inexpensive and flexible way to see films,
and never mind the time lags.
Late or soon, I suspect, expanding domestic screens will meet the shrinking
screens of the multiplex age, in a glorious hi-tech rapprochement, and the
two-phase release system will be phased out altogether. In the meantime my
advice is: bring the controversy into your own homes. Discuss the movies you
see on video with your peer groups or family groups. Be your own Late Show,
South Bank Show or Arena] The three films named above are made for debate
and are impoverished without it.
Some movies, though, do exist happily in a one-to-one relationship with the
viewer. This month you can shed an unruffled private tear over Shadowlands
(CIC), telling of the cancer-doomed romance between CS Lewis (Anthony
Hopkins) and his late American love Joy Gresham (Debra Winger). You can say
farewell to Federico Fellini with his 1965 fantasia Juliet Of The Spirits
(Fabulous Films), and with Gideon Bachman's entertaining bio-documentary
Ciao Federico] (Connoisseur). And you can savour the much-praised charms of
Tran Anh Hung's The Scent Of Green Papaya (Artificial Eye): a haunting
French-Vietnamese film, shot like a moving still life, about love, loss and
the lyricism of everyday domestic life.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: Period plot proves a dramatic dinosaur - Ian
Shuttleworth reviews the new production of Lonsdale's 'On Approval' by Peter
Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN SHUTTLEWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Frederick Lonsdale, we are informed, was 'amongst the most successful
dramatists that ever lived.' In commercial terms, this may be true: in the
1920s and 1930s his plays and musicals were almost guaranteed hits. As far
as theatrical skill goes, however, the foregoing remark is a blatant apology
for Peter Hall's pointless revival of Lonsdale's 1927 play On Approval.
Lonsdale found it inconceivable to create protagonists who were neither
titled nor wealthy. Here we are presented with a shallow and selfish duke
obliged to woo a pickle heiress for her money, and a well-off widow, acerbic
by nature, who invites her genteely fawning suitor to her Scottish country
house for a month to test his compatibility as a prospective spouse. It will
spoil no-one's enjoyment to reveal that in such a (yawn) isolated location,
the two amorous parties (yawn) discover the truth about their beloveds'
temperaments, break off their affairs and resolve (yawn) to mend the duke
and widow by yoking them to each other.
In other words, the plot runs on barely-electrified rails. Any delight must
then derive either from the eloquence of the script or from the nature of
this particular production. Unfortunately, Lonsdale relies entirely on a
hopeful epigrammatic style for his humour; and more often than not it is
numbingly apparent that a well-turned sentence and a polished delivery do
not in themselves make an epigram. His rhetorical menu consists largely of
fortune cookies which are stale, empty or both.
Hall lavishes far more attention on the play than it deserves (hell, a
second consecutive reading is more than it deserves). As the script aims at
Cowardian witticisms but misses the bar by a good foot and a half, so the
performances strive for period poise modulated only by period languor. As
the unconcerned aristocratic booby, Martin Jarvis hits the combination spot
on, cooly forgiving his companions for bridling at his incessant inanities.
Anna Carteret and Simon Ward likewise do commendable service as the widow
Wislack and the timidly besotted Richard. Only Louise Lombard fits awkwardly
in the company, oddly for one whose popular success is rooted in the same
period through her appearances in The House of Eliott. She shows herself an
able and even captivating actress, but unwilling or unable to play the idiom
as her comrades do. It is unusual to criticise an actor for not being
artificial enough, but this is the case as regards Lombard's performance.
Above all, one wonders time and again why On Approval has been revived at
all. The mere act of dramatic archaeology is not enough to merit respect or
attention; the fragment unearthed must be of sufficient intrinsic interest.
All that this production shows us is that theatrical dinosaurs once roamed
the earth, and non-carnivorous dinosaurs at that.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: Why the gods booed the Gods - A look at the virulent
display of disapproval that greeted Covent Garden's new Ring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN HOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rowdy reception given to the Royal Opera's surreal new production of
Wagner's Rheingold at Covent Garden on Thursday marked a novelty in the
history of booing in London. It was unusually virulent, wave on wave of
baying anger billowing across the auditorium from the highest reaches, aimed
mainly at director Richard Jones and designer Nigel Lowery. It was also one
of those rare demonstrations that unite all classes, price levels and
degrees of operatic expertise.
Disapproval more usually observes social demarcation lines. A Covent Garden
Wagner production of Der fliegende Hollander found at least one
tiara-wearing dowager in the stalls shouting 'Rubbish],' while the gods
applauded an innovative concept. Conversely, even an acknowledged disaster
like the Royal Opera's Huguenots two seasons ago had its supporters in the
stalls even as the first night gallery bellowed its contempt. At the new
Rheingold, the booing from the upper ranks blended with exclamations of
'puerile' from the more genteel stalls like a Gilbert and Sullivan double
chorus.
Until fairly recently it was surprising to hear any booing in a British
theatre. John Osborne's works were occasionally the target for audience
hostility, but booing has caught on more readily in the opera house than in
the theatre. This may be to do with the heightened emotional situations of
opera, or the heightened prices a disgruntled punter may have paid; or
perhaps imitation of sinister continental practices. Italy has its
time-honoured claques who demand money from artists in return for
cordiality. Richard Bonynge allegedly called the Scala claque's bluff before
his wife Joan Sutherland's debut - and she survived. Paris was until
recently notorious for the arbitrary way in which the Opera claque would
decide whom to boo that night, irrespective of how the artist might perform.
No sordid considerations of money affected the French claquer. After the
soprano Regine Crespin rose from her seat in the audience to defend a
colleague and shout back at the hecklers, she was subjected to an ugly
campaign of hate mail, death threats and abusive phone calls.
In the 1950s, after a Vienna State Opera Tannhauser, the tenor was chased
through the streets until he lay vomiting with exhaustion and terror on the
pavement, watched by devotees of the lyric art.
The 1950s saw heated correspondence in the British press on whether to boo
or not, a sign perhaps that there are no absolutes in criticism and one
man's deconstructivist illumination is another man's pretentious tosh. More
recently, English National Opera has blazed the trail for respectable booing
with a series of productions that polarised opinion, even erupting into
foyer fisticuffs with the film noir-cum-Dali production of Verdi's Masked
Ball. In the opera house at least, booing is now an established fact of
first night life. But disapproval tends to be reserved for production teams;
for outrageous ideas rather than inadequate performers. Don't shoot the
singer, he's doing his best, seems to be the philosophy in Britain. But the
producer is fair game.

THESIGER by Michael Asher Viking Pounds 20, 582 pages
To judge from his clothes and much-cobbled shoes, Wilfred Thesiger is
obviously an English gentleman. He is probably this century's most
distinguished explorer, and certainly one of the greatest living Englishmen:
Old Etonian, Oxford boxing blue, big-game hunter, colonial administrator,
guerrilla fighter, war hero, horseman, photographer, writer of distinction,
Arabist, friend of emperors, and traveller extraordinary. To the Bedu of
southern Arabia, Thesiger, now 84, was Mbarak: the Blessed One.
He did not go in for stunts. His explorations were true adventures, whether
solving one of Africa's last mysteries, the destination of the Awash river
in Ethiopia; crossing the Empty Quarter of Arabia; living among the Marsh
Arabs of Iraq; or travelling in the remotest parts of equatorial Sudan,
Morocco, western Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Yemen - wherever.
As a result, Thesiger's greatest works, Arabian Sands and The Marsh Arabs,
are superb evocations of the world's wildest places, and of their
inhabitants, at precisely that moment - the middle of the 20th century -
when high technology was bathing mankind in a stark, ungodly light.
Thesiger detests the way that the arrival of the machines has heralded the
obliteration of traditional values: courage, the warrior instinct, loyalty,
dignity, stoic endurance and honesty. For Thesiger, technological society
produces little but selfishness and materialism.
As his biographer says: 'This is Thesiger's legacy: he reminded us that
there is more to our relationship with the earth than can be understood
through a windscreen or analysed in a technical report. It is that elusive
quality best understood by poets, writers, artists and romantics - spirit.'
Thesiger's biographer, Michael Asher, is no keyhole-peeping swot but a
desert explorer in his own right. As well as retracing Thesiger's steps
uphill, down wadi, across quicksand and through the Empty Quarter, Asher
stayed two years in Nairobi, and interviewed the old explorer in his Kenyan
home, a modest cabin.
His admiration for Thesiger is unstinting. Yet Asher is always swift to
describe the paradoxes that underpin Thesiger's self-adopted role as a
living link between the world's 'unspoiled peoples' and the juggernaut of
technology and modernism that is sweeping them away.
For example, Thesiger deliberately courted danger, and remarked: 'Fancy
offering any self-respecting person security from the cradle to the grave .
. . Today most men do not experience enough challenge and hardship . . . How
can people work off their frustrations by kicking a tiny ball in a park?'
There is truth in this statement, says Asher. Yet security, he observes, is
precisely what the high-born Thesiger always had: the cushion of a
privileged place in society from which to launch his manly expeditions. How
easy - one imagines - to have satisfied his restlessness and indulged his
romanticism by seeking out the hardships that primitive peoples endure in
order to survive.
Asher's brisk treatment of Thesiger's sexuality, a subject on which another
writer might have laboured like a beetle with a dungball, is exemplary. The
thing is not a mystery: Thesiger likes men, though he says that his liaisons
with a string of dusky youths throughout his life were what Asher calls
'essentially platonic'.
Thesiger denies he is a misogynist, though he is certainly anti-feminist. 'A
woman tends to bulge in the wrong places', he told Asher. 'It's a pity you
can't have babies in bottles . . . It's probably true to say that I have a
low sex-drive . . . All those months  - five years in the desert - there was
no question of sex and it left me untroubled, just as it did that I couldn't
get a drink or a decent meal.'
Terrestrial exploration is largely finished, and old age has left Thesiger
stranded in disillusionment. We are dinosaurs, he maintains, heading for
extinction. 'There's nothing to be cheerful about . . . Everything is going
to the dogs.'

THE LOST HEART OF ASIA by Colin Thubron William Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 375
pages
Asia's vast heart lies between the Caspian Sea and the mountainous borders
of China. For centuries it was a tumultuous space, bisected by the western
reaches of the Silk Road and ravaged by plundering armies of nomads. The
civilisations that flourished there, before the great rivers dried or
changed course, or before the plunderers came, are marked today by ruins and
dust.
Men once used to mince down the streets of great Central Asian cities in
high-heeled, thigh-length, pointed-toe boots, swathed in dazzling muslins
and riding horses caparisoned in turquoise and gold. The women of their
harems wore 'the most caressing silks in Asia', and painted their eyebrows
with antimony and their finger-nails with balsam. In the markets Chinese,
Hindus, Jews and Persians mingled to exchange Asia's brilliant riches. And
with wealth came learning, arts and ease.
No-one could better Colin Thubron's doleful elegance as recorder of the sad
and potentially dangerous plight into which Central Asia has since fallen,
first as a result of Russian and later Soviet domination, and now as a
result of the passing of that domination.
The grim poverty in Turkmenia and Uzbekistan summons Thubron's melancholy.
The cities are placeless, the hotels empty, the streets silent and dirty.
Bewilderment prevails in the current economic decay and uncertainty. Thubron
writes: 'Dusk emptied the lanes. A few street-lamps stood in stagnant pools
of light, and a call to prayer wavered on the sunset.'
The question that obsessed Thubron as he travelled through Central Asia was,
will it fall into the grip of Islamic fundamentalism? Apart from a few young
men studying in the newly-reopened mullah schools, few of those he quizzed
seemed to think so. They were unconcerned; fundamentalism of the Iranian
kind, they said, was alien to their traditions; their women were too
independent to accept the veil. Some Uzbeks told Thubron they dreamed of a
pan-Turkic federation in the region. They looked to the relatively
flourishing Western-style success of Turkey as an example of what Central
Asia could become. But questions of identity remain indeterminate; many of
Thubron's interlocutors were indifferent to nationalistic appeals, and felt
themselves inheritors of too many races to be deeply moved by considerations
of blood. Instead they appealed to a wider, more inclusive but still
diffuse, sense of Moslem brotherhood.
Thubron's chief fear is that the current mixture of political dislocation
and deep poverty will prove volatile. Gangsterism prevails, inflation soars,
the peoples of the region have exchanged Soviet illusions for what seems to
many of them a desperate futurelessness. The common cry is 'Last year mutton
cost three roubles, now it is three hundred.' It is unsurprising how many
told Thubron they regretted the Soviet era's passing, and cursed Gorbachev
for a betrayer.
The central episode of Thubron's wanderings among Central Asia's oases,
mountains and steppes was a wild dash by car through the Pamir Mountains
into Tajikistan, travelling just ahead of the civil war erupting there, and
threading a way through snow-clogged, avalanche-gashed passes high above the
snow-line. It makes for thrilling reading, and brings some of the region's
wildest and grandest beauty vividly into view.
But Thubron is happiest when he is saddest, picking his solitary way among
poignant ruins and meditating on the fate of civilisations.
A looming presence in Thubron's vision of Central Asia is Tamerlane, the
great emperor who built Samarkand. He was a descendant of the legendary
virgin Alangoa, who had given birth after being ravished by a moonbeam.
Tamerlane conquered a vast quarter of the world, and brought back as slaves
the best builders and artists to construct his capital. His monument is a
huge cairn of stones in a high pass of the Mountains of Heaven, which divide
Kazakhstan from China. 'It was said that Tamerlane, passing east with his
army, ordered every soldier to gather up one rock and pile it in the pass,'
Thubron tells us. 'Years later, on his return, each man took away his stone
to Samarkand, and those that remain became a cenotaph to the fallen.' It was
a fitting place for Thubron's own journey to end.

THE MAJOR EFFECT edited by Dennis Kavanagh and Anthony Seldon Macmillan
Pounds 20, 500 pages
CONSERVATIVE CENTURY: THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SINCE 1900 edited by Anthony
Seldon and Stuart Ball Oxford University Press Pounds 20, 842 pages
John Major has been British Prime Minister for nearly four years - longer
than Eden, Home, Callaghan and Heath. Despite recent opinion polls, and the
assumption between the lines of these two books - that the Tory Party has
been in office so long that it is bound to fall in the next general election
 -I would not bet against Major his producing an all-time record.
The case for him is not easily acceptable to students and practitioners of
politics. It is the case for weak government: incompetent, contradictory,
but generally keeping the show on the road. Harold Wilson, with whose prime
ministerial performance Major's has so much in common, described it thus:
'The best style of government is like rowing  - the ideal solution is to get
the boat along as quickly as possible without turning it over.' Meanwhile,
Wilson might have added, life goes on.
So it is with Major who began by saying that Britain was at the heart of
Europe, that the Maastricht treaty was 'game, set and match to Britain' and
retreated into trying to hold his party together. One could say the same
about British membership of the exchange rate mechanism: Major as chancellor
took Britain in, Major as prime minister defended staying, and Major still
as prime minister took Britain out.
None of that is particularly to denigrate Major: Britain is clearly a hard
country to govern, as Wilson discovered. Perhaps it is governed too much,
not too little.
It is also quite hard to write contemporary history. How contemporary is
contemporary if it is to be considered history, and when do journalists
shade into historians? The editors and writers of The Major Effect have made
a decent attempt. Their aim was to examine how much or how little has
changed in the British political system since the departure of Margaret
Thatcher as prime minister. Yet there must be some reservations about their
achievements.
One is a tendency to look over the shoulder at the last opinion poll and
forward to the next in case it produces a shift. There can be no assured
judgments from writers like those. There are also some follies. Thus William
Wallace writes in his essay on foreign policy that under the ownership of
Conrad Black The Spectator 'revived to become the leading political weekly
of the right'. One wonders about the size of the competition.
The most intellectually distinguished piece is by Peter Jay, the economics
editor of the BBC, on the economy; yet, as Jay admits, it has little to do
with the theme of the book: it is a restatement of his own opposition to
fixed exchange rates. Still, this must be one of the few published essays to
pay tribute to Norman Lamont as chancellor. Jay thinks that Lamont was too
loyal to Major in going along with ERM membership in the first place: he was
Cardinal Wolsey to Henry VIII. Moreover, it was Lamont who introduced the
unified budget - one of the biggest changes of the Major period and indeed
in postwar budgeting. This week Lamont fought back.
The most interesting piece is on law and the constitution by Simon Lee,
Professor of Jurisprudence at Queen's University, Belfast. Lee points out
that the courts and judicial reviews are gradually surpassing parliament in
their political importance. There is, too, the challenge from Brussels and
the European Parliament, with which Westminster has yet to come to terms.
Both books are a little too kind to the Conservative Party to be considered
wholly objective. The much longer Conservative Century draws its title from
the number of elections the party has won in the last 95 years. One is
reminded of looking at the results of the Boat Race: at a certain period
Cambridge seemed dominant, then relentlessly Oxford began to catch up.
More seriously, the book fails to distinguish between conservatism with a
small and large 'c'. It is perfectly possible to regard Labour as more
conservative than the Tories, which may explain the present threat from Tony
Blair. Moreover, the writers take little account of chance and political
cock-ups. The sequence of electoral victories might have been quite
different (say) if Attlee had held on in 1951 when the economic boom could
have come to Labour's rescue, if Harold Wilson had delayed a bit in 1970,
and if Edward Heath had not gone to the country in February 1974.
Above all, it fails to point out that the continued electoral success of the
Conservative Party has partly depended on the existence of two oppositions.
This was as true at the beginning of the century as it is now. Why Labour
and Liberals do not learn from this is another matter.
The Tories have usually had the edge on propaganda, but even there they do
not always win. As Richard Cockett describes, in 1929 - well before Saatchi
&amp; Saatchi - the party employed JH Benson's, well known for its
advertisements for Guinness. They came up with the very conservative slogan
'Safety First': the Tories lost.

MRS JORDAN'S PROFESSION: THE STORY OF THE GREAT ACTRESS AND THE FUTURE KING
by Claire Tomalin Viking Pounds 18, 414 pages
In 1811, the most famous and beautiful actress in England was in her
dressing room when she was handed a letter. It announced that her husband,
the father of ten of her 13 children, was leaving her to seek better
marriage prospects. She could negotiate a settlement, but if she caused
trouble, she knew she would lose custody of the family. She went on stage,
gave a thrilling performance, burst into tears when another character
described her as 'laughing drunk', and slid into the wings. Five years later
she died, penniless and forgotten.
The actress was Dora Jordan and her common-law husband was the future King
William IV, with whom she lived in domestic bliss for 21 years. At the core
of the nation's history, she entertained for him, was friends with the
Prince Regent, with Charles James Fox and the playwright Sheridan. But her
glittering menage was built on social ambiguity and political corruption;
beneath was a vulnerable single mother who literally sang for her supper.
Like the comic part she acted while her heart was breaking, her life hinged
on the gulf between appearance and reality.
This is a riveting biography. In recent years, blockbuster Lives have
centred on Victorians. Tomalin is one of several major biographers now
reversing that trend to fix on the 18th century. Her book conjures up a
rich, alluring period which, in its brittle decadence and love of scandal
and flamboyance, often seems closer than the 19th century to our own times.
Public life and individual privacy; the limits of sexual freedom; the place
of art in society; working mums; her tale resounds with our most topical
issues.
Dora Jordan was born in 1761 into a family of strolling players. At 21, she
supported her deserted mother and her own illegitimate daughter on the
provincial boards. By 25, she had made the roles of Rosalind and Viola her
own - Charles Lamb called her 'Shakespeare's woman' - and she played
Wycherly's Country Wife for her London debut.
In all three parts her mix of toughness and vulnerability shone, and soon
she was a popular star. She earned Pounds 200 a year from Sheridan's Drury
Lane theatre at a time when Jane Austen thought Pounds 140 an ample living
for a clergyman and his family; a single benefit night doubled her annual
salary, and admirers threw purses containing Pounds 300 at her as she took
curtain calls.
Tomalin is inspired on the wit and razzle dazzle of Drury Lane, in the 1780s
a magnet for politicians, intellectuals, kings. The cat's cradle of
partner-swapping among the Sheridans, the Royals and Dora recalls Cos fan
Tutte - there was even a Royal dinner party in 1789 where the men dressed up
as Turks and invited their wives to identify them with kisses, only to burst
in through a side door and reveal the Turks as servants. That Cos was
written in Vienna that year makes Europe seem small and homogeneous.
But as in the opera, the bright sheen turned dark. Prince William, heavily
in debt, cast about for a rich wife; there are shades of the new sentimental
19th century morality when he found one barely older than his daughters and
wrote: 'She is doomed, poor dear innocent creature, to be my wife.'
Dora's girls had to live with governesses in the Prince's household, and her
boys were sent to the army. Dora lent money to a son-in-law who defaulted,
and made her bankrupt, and the Royal lawyers urged her abroad to avoid
arrrest. Neither pride nor avarice, she wrote, but 'the loss of my only
remaining comfort, the hope I used to live on from time to time, of seeing
my children,' made her desperate to return. She died alone in Boulogne.
William, like Leontes in A Winter's Tale, remorsefully commissioned a
life-sized statue, but neither he nor Queen Victoria - who banished the
statue to the sculptor's studio - was keen to revive Dora's memory.
Tomalin is never stridently political; but a burning sense of outrage at
Dora's social and sexual helplessness, at bigoted illegitimacy laws and at
the hardship of a lifetime of births and miscarriages - Dora's colleague
Sarah Siddons once went into labour on stage - fuelled this account. It is
the most haunting biography I have read this year.

SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME by Marlon Brando with Robert Lindsey Century
Pounds 17.99, 468 pages
THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE by Robert Evans Aurum Pounds 16.95, 412 pages
Sometimes a movie career seems like a giant rehearsal for the autobiography.
Years of signing deals, speaking the right lines, grinning for the cameras:
they all fall into place when the protagonist can at last say 'Ya boo'. No
more lies. No more lines. Here is how it was, and how he is.
But will the reader, brought up on the movie myths, recognise the truth when
he reads it? And what kind of truth is it? Are not the autobiographer's
verities as subjective as anyone else's? Here are two self-portraits that
seem as definitively non-definitive as any we have met.
Marlon Brando and Robert Evans collided professionally just once. At
Paramount in 1970, Evans gave the nod to Brando playing the title role in
The Godfather. A reluctant nod, claims Brando: Evans thought he was too
young. But soon the 47-year-old Method legend was stuffing cotton wool in
his cheeks, honing that Italianate croak and earning his second Oscar. The
first was for his historic mumblings and scratchings - that astonishing
essay in downplaying that should not have worked but did - in On The
Waterfront.
Now the two men collide again in the bookshops. Brando's Songs My Mother
Taught Me is a vast, slurred, exasperating ego trip that takes him all the
way from Nebraska boyhood - son of an 'off-the-shelf drunk' (mother) and a
'card-carrying prick' (father) - to Tahitian retirement.
That retirement has now lasted 20 years. Since the 1972/73 double whammy of
The Godfather and Last Tango In Paris, Brando has been lured back to the
cameras rarely, briefly and usually for the money. He picked up a cool
million for playing Superman's Dad. And he picked up even more for mumbling
lazily, as he admits, through Christopher Columbus as Torquemada. 'An
embarrassingly bad performance,' its perpetrator sums up: but he still took
the Dollars 5m.
Meanwhile, Robert Evans rose from brief indistinction as a juvenile-lead
actor to infant-prodigy movie mogul. He headed Paramount at 29, ran it for
ten years, and hauled it from bottom to top in the studio league table. The
Odd Couple, Love Story, The Godfather, Chinatown . . . Money disguised as
celluloid.
But where do you go after that glamorous uphill run? Only one way:
glamorously downhill. Evans's beautiful and damned life could have been
scripted by F. Scott Fitzgerald. (He played Irving Thalberg, model for FSF's
last tycoon, on screen and later produced The Great Gatsby). Cocaine and
murder suspicions whirled around Evans in the 1970s and 80s  - though his
part in killings connected to The Cotton Club were never proven - and he
finally fell back into movie production. Happy ending? Not quite. His first
film for Paramount after re-hab was the inauspicious Sliver.
Evans's life makes a better story than Brando's and a far better
autobiography. He seems to have written his own material. Snappy
conversations are set down with total recall. And the prose is glorious with
Tinseltown-speak.
Meanwhile Mr Lazybones of Tahiti, after rising on the rollers of his
god-given talent to the heights of Streetcar, Waterfront and Godfather, now
sits on his coral atoll expatiating on transcendental meditation, the plight
of the Indians and his numerous, supposedly rollicking sexual exploits.
These go on forever. Sometimes he talks about acting: and the book comes
alive when he does. We learn about the improvised genesis of the famed taxi
scene in Waterfront; about lying on ice to intensify the death scene in
Mutiny On The Bounty; about tearing out his emotional innards in Last Tango.
We even learn about those infamous cue-cards. Yes, Brando does read his
dialogue off bits of paper stuck round the set. But, he argues, it lends
freshness and the illusion of thought; and who, having seen Brando act, can
complain?
Both books are partial works in all senses. Self-justifying;
self-glamorising (sometimes through shrewd self-deprecation); and manifestly
short of the whole truth. The largest lacuna in the Brando book is the
murder trial of his son Christian. The largest hole in the Evans book is a
sense of the man in repose; indeed of anyone identifiably human.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (11): The winter of the 'honest brochure' - Arnie
Wilson takes a light-hearted look at the tour companies' annual output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON

<TEXT>
Now that we are ruled by European mandarins, tour operators can no longer
make extravagant claims.
Not that Le Ski (0484-548996) ever did, but it is playing extra safe this
year. Many of its chalets in Courchevel have 'decent sized' rooms. And
'although neither the chalet Aramis or Athos would win any architectural
design awards they are solid 1960s chalets in which everything works'.
While it will no longer wash to claim that St Firmin in the Basses Alpes has
'superb expert terrain' it is still possible to get away with more esoteric
descriptions that cannot quite be disproved because in the end they are so
subjective.
Last winter two words dominated the ski brochures: 'nestled' (much favoured
by Airtours 0706-260000) and 'superb' (used frequently by the Swiss Travel
Service - 0920-463971). This year we have a new one: 'heaven'.
It is used to describe almost every North America resort by Crystal Holidays
(081-399 5144) - but rarely, if at all, for its European resorts, which tend
to be merely 'paradises'.
Killington, we learn, is a 'beginner's heaven'; Buttermilk and Snowmass are
'beginners' and families' heaven'.
Intermediates will find 'their own ski heaven' in both Jackson Hole and
Crested Butte, while 'powder-hounds will be in seventh heaven' in Steamboat.
(Seventh heaven is also the destination for intermediates in Breckenridge.)
And naturally, Heavenly in California is 'heavenly both in name and in
fact]'
Canada, it seems, also qualifies. Whistler is an 'intermediates' heaven'.
There must be something lacking in Stowe, Vail, Keystone, Park City and
Mammoth. All fail to receive recognition from above.
Simply Ski (081-742 2541) is scrupulously honest about the daunting black
runs that lead to some of its chalets in Courchevel, giving a new twist to
the 'ski in, ski out' concept. The Chalet Madelon, for example, is 'ideal
for those adventurous enough to negotiate the route on skis back to the
door'. Likewise the Chalet Radja, where 'adventurous skiers can ski straight
to the door'.
Simply Ski's director of operations, James Armitage has taken a leaf from
the brochures of some of his rivals who last winter featured in their own
brochures, appearing as he does in two photographs.
Ditto Collineige's (0276-24262) brochure, in which Colleen Gerrand (the
company is named after her) pictures her husband Jean-Marie Olianti, a
high-mountain guide, peering Adonis-like across the Mer de Glace in
Chamonix's Vallee Blanche . . .
This is a famous off-piste run: but not every tour operator seems to be
quite sure what the various piste colours signify. Sally Holidays Ski Drive
France (081-395 3030) may find it gets complaints from beginners confused by
brochure claims that red runs are for beginners/intermediates and blue runs
are for intermediates.
Ski Panorama (0273-206531) which specialises in Andorra and Italy even
out-does Simply Ski in the honesty department. 'Sheets are always provided,
but not always towels,' it warns. 'And there will usually be one toilet
roll, but this won't last all week]'
Panorama also describes Pas de la Casa-Grau Roig as having 'no architectural
charm' and warns that 'some rooms at the Hotel Duc (in Soldeu-El Tarter) can
be a little noisy due to their situation over the disco' and that 'the Music
Pub (in Livigno) is noisy and this can filter through to the apartments - so
we don't recommend this accommodation for light sleepers'.
Ski Esprit (0252-616789) is another company which is refreshingly honest -
even in its choice of clients' letters. Last year it included one or two
negative comments ('We would have preferred less food but better wine') and
this year, among the praise is: 'In contrast to the excellence of the
evening meal, breakfast was very disappointing.'
Would that Silver Ski (0622-735544) might be brave enough to include just
one even slightly less-than-glowing hero-gram in its litany of praise. Or
does every single client find it perfect? Out of 48 bouquets in its
brochure, there is not even the tiniest niggle.
My one niggle about Virgin Ski's (0293-617181) cheerful brochure is the
trail maps. Many of them are almost meaningless - especially Squaw Valley,
where the runs on six mountains have been reduced to what looks like the
haphazard scribblings of a monkey with a bag of coloured pens.
In Switzerland, Klosters, the favourite stamping ground of British royalty
also has some gems - literary carbuncles of a sort - in its promotional
brochures this year. Klosters' 'degree of stimulation is 2' we are told.
This includes 'stranger baths' (sounds ominous) and other attractions.
You get a lot more, it seems, for your Stotinki and Bani when you ski in
'Beautiful Bulgaria' and 'Romantic Romania'. Ski Balkantours (0232-246795)
compares prices with those in France. A cup of coffee on the mountain in the
'winter paradise' of Pamporovo or the 'championship ski resort' of Borovets
would cost you 10p or so, and Pounds 1.15 in France. A portion of chips
would cost 25p in eastern Europe and Pounds 2.30 in France.
Ski Inghams (081-789 3331) has delivered a rather crushing snub to this
annual brochure review. Last year I took it to task for a sloppy description
of my favourite ski area, Jackson Hole ('nestled astride the magnificent
Grand Tetons,' etc).
This year, in response to my criticism . . . it has not changed a word. But
worse, Ski The American Dream (081-552 1201), perhaps searching for
inspiration for its description of Jackson, has come up with: 'Jackson Hole,
nestled astride the magnificent Tetons.'
It also describes Aspen as a 'Ski Heaven'. Could all these brochures be the
work of one copy-writer? Or perhaps a whole team of them working in the new
French Olympic resort of La Tania, which, as Stena Sealink Ski Drive
Holidays (0303-221010) quite correctly points out was 'purpose-built for use
by tourists'.
Powder Byrne's (071-223 0601) new brochure informs us that it has made some
'interesting changes' telling us that there is 'no room for complacency'.
What can this mean?
'We have added an extra nanny in Klosters and introduced 'Fat Boy' boy skis
on powder courses.' Nothing shattering, then. There are some 'interesting
new hotels too,' but the company stays loyal to its 'grand old creaky Hotel
Vereina' even though Powder Byrne thinks it should be rated 'upper three
star' rather than four-star.
I normally like to compare Powder Byrne's brochure with Ski Scott Dunn's
(081-767 0202), as they are usually the best two. But since Mr Dunn's
brochure appears have been lost on its way to the remote part of New Zealand
in which I am currently leafing through the pages of his rivals, I am sadly
unable to do so.
Ski Thomson's (081-200 8733) brochure has arrived, and I am shocked to find
it has dropped America for the first time in almost a decade. Could it have
fallen out on the way here?
Finally, according to one Japanese brochure: 'The ski season depends on the
snowing conditions. Facilities include the kinds of lifting apparatuses at a
ski resort.' So I should hope]

FT  15 OCT 94 / Sport: Drivers fuel the fireworks display - Formula One / A
look at tomorrow's European grand prix and the potentially explosive clash
between Hill and Schumacher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the script leading up to tomorrow's European Grand Prix near Jerez,
Spain's sherry capital, was a fictional work, its writers would stand
accused of hatching an implausible plot after too much of the local tipple.
Even the bitter, headline-grabbing rivalries of several years ago, between
former world champions Alain Prost and the late Ayrton Senna, are no match
for the complex interplay of passions and personalities which will make
tomorrow's start one of the most exciting - and potentially hazardous - in
memory.
The return of the moodily aggressive Nigel Mansell from IndyCar racing to
drive the last three races of the season for Williams-Renault, alongside
fellow Briton Damon Hill, has already generated high tension for tomorrow's
race.
Mansell, at 41 and after a lacklustre season's racing in the US, has a
determination to prove wrong those critics who say he should retire -
notwithstanding his claims this week that he only wants to make the end of
the season 'more entertaining'. At stake for Mansell is the prospect of a
permanent seat with Williams for the 1995 season instead of the talented
young Scot, David Coulthard.
Hill was already under psychological pressure before the teams even arrived
at the undulating Jerez circuit.
He, too, has been smarting from media rumblings - in his case that he is not
fast enough or aggressive enough to make world champion material, and that
he is in the running for this year's championship solely because of the
two-race ban from which the German Michael Schumacher and his Benetton-Ford
have just returned.
In testing at Estoril in Portugal last week, Schumacher immediately returned
to form, outpacing Hill by more than half-a-second, and Benetton team-mate
Jos Verstappen by more than three seconds - the latter light-years in grand
prix terms, equivalent to around 200 yards per lap.
Hill, just one point behind Schumacher because of the ban, was not only
contemplating the prospect of a daunting fight against the young German
tomorrow; he was also worrying about how to make it plain that he is capable
of keeping Mansell behind him on ability, not just team orders.
But Schumacher has now raised the emotional ante sharply. All his resentment
over the ban, and the unsubstantiated innuendo concerning cheating which has
swirled around the Benetton team for months, boiled over before yesterday's
qualifying into a withering verbal attack on Hill - a 'little man', he
maintained, with unrealistic ambitions.
Few had suspected the depth of the grievance he was nursing against Hill,
over remarks made by the Englishman that 'no one should shed tears' over
Schumacher's ban (for disregarding a black flag at the British grand prix in
July).
Hill, Schumacher made plain, should have kept quiet, like the other leading
drivers.
And with a disdain that must have felt desperately wounding to Hill, he
maintained that Hill had become lead driver at Williams only by the accident
of Senna's death and that Hill 'never was a No 1 driver. David Coulthard was
quicker than him after three races. I do not have as much respect for him as
other drivers.'
As many in the Jerez paddock saw it, the outburst comprised a mix of
understandable frustration and an increasingly arrogant posture from the
23-year-old German.
Whatever the pros and cons, it has left scores to be settled tomorrow.
As the principal of one of the leading teams, for obvious morale reasons not
wishing to be identified, observes: 'Schumacher has a second in his pocket
over everyone else. That's why everyone will be after him when his contract
with Benetton ends at the end of 1995. Let's be clear: whoever gets him has
won the championship. At the moment he is unique; there is no one in his
class.'
The slanging matches of recent hours may have sullied the atmosphere but the
will-to-win among the rivals has become palpable.
'We're in for a terrific end to the championship. The racing is tough and
that's the way it should be,' observes team boss Frank Williams.
For a season that began in such sombre fashion, with the deaths of Senna and
Roland Ratzenberger, it is finishing on a higher note than anyone could have
expected amid the shock and the welter of safety-driven rule changes ushered
in after the fatalities.
The changes, to make circuits safer and cars slower and more predictable in
their behaviour, may have been forced through unconstitutionally, as the
teams claim, by the FIA, the sport's governing body, but they are
acknowledged to have resulted in safer and more driveable cars.
That said, 'they are still 800 horsepower powering 515 kilogrammes. They are
still a man's car; no, not really, they're rocketships', says Williams.
Next year, the rockets will be slower. With smaller engines - 3 litres, not
3.5; smaller wings, less downforce and more weight.
It means, says Williams, that this year's cars 'will be total scrap at the
end of the season'.
The teams maintain that after next year's changes, there must be a prolonged
period of rules stability to contain costs and take account of resources
available.
With some possible exceptions, it looks like they may get it. Relations
between the FIA and the teams, so turbulent in the past, are acquiring a
stability which most are hopeful will endure - even though there is a
feeling among the top teams that the new rules may not achieve all the
safety goals to which FIA president Max Mosley aspires.
Only on the subject of refuelling is there real concern. The horrendous
picture of the fireball which engulfed Benetton-Ford's pit earlier this
season, when the refuelling hose slipped, shocked the world. Mosley and his
cohorts must search their consciences as to whether it should be rescinded.
On that occasion, the fire-fighting equipment worked admirably.
It is unlikely to deal with the fireworks tomorrow.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Right on to the end of the road: Simon Hughes goes walking
with Ffyona Campbell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HUGHES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been a television series, a book, and countless articles written
about her. But there is a good chance you have got the wrong impression of
round-the-world walker Ffyona Campbell. Contrary to what you might have been
led to believe, she is perfectly pleasant.
But, as so often happens with people who stand out from the crowd, her image
has been reduced to that of a rancorous, scheming bitch.
Ffyona, who started her world walk 11 years ago and finished yesterday
morning, finds the label attached to her hurts - almost as much as her feet.
Beneath the iron will that drives her along there lies a sensitive soul.
Criticisms, wild arms-length judgments from people who have hardly met her,
have damped her spirit, but not crippled it. Conversely, the people at the
roadside wishing her well, friendly drivers stopping for autographs, elicit
flushes of satisfaction. 'Oh, thank you, thank you,' she said to a family
who pressed a Scottish pound into her hand.
At temporary rest points or primitive camp-sites she fusses around clumps of
exhausted bodies, draining their blisters, immersing their feet in salt
water and administering second skin from a plastic box.
She has limitless energy, gulping down her evening meal before disappearing
into a nearby tenpin bowling centre to be interviewed by TV presenter Janet
Street-Porter.
'Can I have a quick word with you, Janet?' I said when they had finished.
'No, sorry, I've had a long journey from Lancashire and I'm rather tired,'
she replied with unintentional irony.
'That's the problem with the media,' Ffyona said, as we marched briskly up a
farm track the following morning. 'None of them has been prepared to
experience what I endure. Only by sharing the pain I feel and the
exhilaration of seeing the van at the next stop can they really understand
what this is all about.'
During our eight-hour hike through the Scottish Highlands, she talked
incessantly. She was inquisitive, observant and reflective: 'I haven't
walked with people before and gradually I have become more patient. I
suppose I have matured.'
Her alleged irascibility was nowhere to be found. 'It upsets me when people
don't try,' she said, echoing the attitude of many top athletes.
'But look at her, she's brilliant,' she added, pointing at a woman teetering
downhill on tip-toe in obvious agony. 'Come on, Janice, keep going]' she
urged. 'That's it, not far.'
Some people collect stamps or coins or autographs. Ffyona Campbell collects
miles.
What makes people do these crazy things? It is an impossible question, but
we should not castigate people simply because we do not understand them.
Obviously they make promises to themselves that they feel obliged to keep.
Ultra-determined people can be fanatical about their goal - a trait which
can alienate others.
On Sunday night, Ffyona pored over the map of Monday's route, illuminated by
wood burning in an old oil drum. 'No, I don't do that]' she said, having
noticed a short ferry ride across the Cromarty Firth. 'We must use a road if
possible. If I don't walk every step I would never forgive myself.'
Attention to detail is evident in the placing of a stone at the day's end -
so she knows exactly where to start from in the morning.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Motoring: A-plus for effort, B-plus for the car - Stuart
Marshall believes Chrysler's compact competitor will mature like a young
wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler deserves an A-plus for effort with its Neon compact car. Here we
have an American manufacturer, known best for its millions of standard-size
US automobiles, Jeeps and mini-vans (multi-purpose vehicles), challenging
Europe and Japan at their own game.
By US standards, the Neon is a small car (although medium sized in European
and Japanese eyes). A four-door saloon that seats four to five people, it is
larger than a Ford Escort but a little smaller than a Mondeo.
The 132 horsepower, two-litre, four-cylinder engine drives the front wheels
though a five-speed gearbox. Suspension is all-independent, power steering
and two air-bags are standard, and the styling is clean and vaguely
mid-Atlantic.
The Neon is innocent of chromium-plated excesses. Inside, it looks sober
enough to please German buyers, although the well-shaped seats yield
comfortably in the Italian style. The driving position is excellent - a
tilt-adjustable steering wheel helps - and the gear-shift is light and
positive.
Head-room is ample and all-round visibility good. The only features
Europeans will find unfamiliar are the old-fashioned push-pull lighting
switch on the fascia, and a clutch pedal that has to be depressed before the
starter will operate. (US car-makers had bruising experiences with insurance
claims from owners careless enough to have started in gear and driven though
garage walls.)
A day spent driving a Neon in Germany left me with mixed feelings. On the
plus side, the ride and handling felt strictly European because the
suspension has been developed to suit tastes on this side of the Atlantic.
(American buyers get a similar suspension only on the sportiest Neon. The
standard car there is sprung much more softly to cope with broken road
surfaces.)
It was a reasonably lively performer, although I would have expected more
muscularity from a two-litre engine in a modestly-sized car. But the most
important thing was that, within five minutes of moving off, I felt
completely at home.
On the debit side, it lacked the refinement buyers have come to expect of
European and Japanese cars in the Neon's class. In town, the engine was
flexible - due, in part, to low gearing (about 20mph/32kph per 1000rpm in
top) - but it sounded quite strident when accelerating and fussy when
cruising on the autobahn at 80mph (130kph) and over.
The transmission whined and, especially at low speeds, was affected by what
is known in the trade as shunt; that is, it jerked when going from power-on
to power-off because the engine rocked on its mountings.
The Neon is being sold in mainland Europe now but will not arrive in Britain
with right-hand steering until the end of next year - its first UK
appearance will be at the London Motor Show in October 1995. By that time,
Chrysler should have removed the irritations and be on the way to realising
the Neon's potential as competition for established marques.
Apart from Fords and Opels, Renaults and Peugeots, Nissans, Toyotas and
Hondas, rivals will include such cars as the Korean-made Hyundai Lantra. But
Chrysler Jeep Imports UK - which, in the past year, has beaten all
expectations with its sales of petrol-engined Jeep Wranglers and Cherokees
in a 4x4 market dominated by diesels - thinks the Neon will appeal to buyers
looking for something a bit different.
Price will be the key. When the Neon gets to Britain early in 1996, an
educated guess puts the target figure for a basic right-hand drive model at
about Pounds 10,000. A top of the range model loaded with every extra,
including air-conditioning, might be just under Pounds 13,000. At that, a
Neon could look attractive as an alternative to something more conventional.
As a car, I give it only a B-plus at the moment but, like a young wine, it
will mature. Nor should one under-rate the customer appeal of its Chrysler
name - one of the oldest and most famous in car-making - and American
provenance.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Travel: A big-sky identity - Sarah Anderson considers the
fierce pride of Montana's people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The highway patrol officer was apologetic. He had stopped me for speeding,
the needle of my speedometer having shot off the end of the dial. 'That will
be a Dollars 5 fine,' he said. This was Montana - big-sky country - where
car licence plates have a series of inverted V's followed by a long straight
line: mountains in the west and then miles and miles of flat, flat land.
The Rocky mountains in west Montana are brown and arid in summer, with
sprinklings of coniferous trees on their parched slopes - odd in a region
where rivers and creeks, full of trout, criss-cross the landscape.
This western part of Montana is experiencing a cultural clash. This is not a
new experience. The original inhabitants, the native indians, were appalled
by the trappers, traders, buffalo hunters and prospectors who descended on
them. In turn, these mountain men were horrified by the arrival of
missionaries, settlers and ranchers, while the ranchers saw the next influx
 -sheep herders and settled farmers - as . . . appalling.
But whereas the cultural clashes of the past came in waves from the east,
this time the incomers are mostly from the west, from California. As a
result, the frontier is turning back on itself, and the latest newcomers are
not popular.
As a resident of Bowman told me: 'If I find out someone's from somewhere far
away, I am rude to them. I get annoyed and angry. I feel they were in their
place and it got ruined. Now they are coming to my place to ruin it.' His
views are not unusual, as the messages on T-shirts imply: 'Montana Sucks:
Now go Home and Tell Your Friends', and 'Beautify Montana: put a Californian
on a Bus'.
A notice on the way into Livingston, a small town in the west, shows how the
residents have even resorted to irony to express their feelings: 'Have you
hugged a tourist today?'
The changes are both rapid and radical, and the cappuccino cowboys and
Lycra-clad mountain bikers with their 'ranchettes' and trophy homes are
sneered at. But the old economy, which depended on ranching as well as the
now-finished industries of logging and mining, could no longer sustain the
population.
Montana's new economy is based on property and recreation, and although the
newcomers are turning the old Wild West into the Virtual West - a term used
by William Kittredge to describe the practice of turning simple land into
safe, watered, walled, stuccoed interpretations of the old west - a new west
had to emerge. And the newcomers, many from Hollywood, do have money.
It would be easy to romanticise the past, but far better that it should be
appreciated for what it was, with all its shortcomings. In western culture,
which is both environmentally aware and travel crazy, urban dwellers tend to
go to the wilderness to search for 'great places and sacred places' in order
to get a quick high and to try and capture a sense of the violent past.
However, as the frontier turns back on itself, so the violence changes from
being predominantly rural to predominantly urban. The cities are the new
wild places.
The fragile landscape desperately needs help, but the environmentalists have
not provided all the answers. There is deep suspicion of those who do not
live in the west but like to dictate what they believe should happen there.
The harsh and spartan life endured by the original pioneers created an
individualistic, independent and tough breed of people whose descendants are
now pivotal figures on the extreme right. Neo-Nazism and the Ku Klux Klan
have strongholds in Montana. Both movements appear to be growing because
people fear losing control of their lives.
Jobs and traditional uses of land are both threatened, and it is important
that newcomers recognise that the locals need to earn a living. As the
editor of High Country News says: 'God, who wants a place with nothing but a
bunch of yuppies running around?'

FT  15 OCT 94 / Travel: So very Kiwi - clean and green - John Westbrooke
revisits his homeland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WESTBROOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The skies over New Zealand are broad, blue and bitingly clear. It has
something to do with lack of pollution, and with sea breezes - and, alas,
with the ozone layer.
It seems very unfair. Fridges and aerosol cans spew out CFCs north of the
equator, but the southern hemisphere bears the brunt: a fluctuating hole
over Antarctica and a distinct thinning over New Zealand, Australia and
Chile. You can still tan, but with care and high-factor sun cream.
It is particularly unfair because New Zealand is one of the greenest of
countries, and Kiwis the greenest of people. They are devoted to the
environment, and they have a lot of it - imagine a land the size of Britain
filled with a population of only 3.5m.
New Zealand outdoorsmen invented jogging, jet-boating and bungee jumping
(and, they claim on fairly persuasive grounds, aeroplanes). Rugby remains
the big spectator sport, but most people's pastimes are wide-open-spaces
stuff: yachting, running, tramping (the local term for hiking).
We went tramping for a few hours along the Marlborough Sounds at the top of
the South Island, New Zealand's sunniest region. A fast boat, with dolphins
surfing in its wake, took us from Picton to Resolution Bay and the road-free
home of John Teutscher, our guide. He generates his own power and grows his
own food, and what he cannot provide himself comes on the same boats as we
did: meals-on-keels, they call themselves.
His wife, he said, was the expert on trees; his speciality was birds. So it
proved, as he charmed fantails and bellbirds out of the bushes with what
sounded like faultless imitations of their calls.
The sun filtered down between branches high above, and through green gaps we
caught glimpses of blue water and blue hills along Queen Charlotte Sound. As
we reached the halfway ridge, the trees around us were not all natives:
early farmers had cleared the land, planted imports and then given up, and
it was reverting to such overgrowth as black beeches with honeydew sap -
which draw wasps by the dozen.
Over the ridge was real evergreen New Zealand bush: silver ferns, nikau
palms and big rimu trees, 140ft high and 800 years old. (For the even bigger
and older kauri, you have to go to the far north of the country.) At sea
level we reached Ship Cove, named by Captain Cook who visited it five times
on his three voyages in the 1770s; and we relaxed on the beach, recovered
our breath and waited for the boat to pick us up.
The isolation is real, and I sympathised with the farm children we met
around the sounds, studying by correspondence and going fishing by way of
entertainment. Some families bring in paying guests for 'homestays',
typically involving transport by boat or float-plane, excellent home
cooking, a warm spa pool under the stars. Here you can wake up, watch the
morning mist rising over the water, and know you will need binoculars to see
the neighbours.
We stayed with the Perrets in Bay of Many Coves, lunched with the Robbs in
Kenepuru Sound, and visited the Brakenridges' sheep station on Pohuenui
Island, all of them miles from one another and delighted to offer
hospitality to strangers.
From the farm's highest point, we looked around 360 degrees, at more islets
and inlets than we could count, alternating fingers of blue and green
stretching into the distance.
There are only a couple of towns in the area: Picton, the ferry port through
which most people drive without noticing, and Havelock, on the next sound.
Havelock is little more than a village but two noted scientists began their
schooling there: William Pickering, who worked on the US space programme,
and Ernest Rutherford, who split the atom - an irony in a country so
passionately anti-nuclear.
New Zealanders' utopian ideals are encouraged by their remoteness from their
neighbours: a 1,500-mile circle round Picton will contain no one else but
penguins and Australians. Most native animals are unique, including birds
such as the kiwi which have forgotten how to fly as they have nowhere to go.
Politicians are free to experiment: the country pioneered the welfare state
and votes for women, and is now struggling with an extreme market economy.
And the people are as New Age as any Californian. One women's magazine
features not only the usual agony aunt, astrological and medical pages but
columns by a vet, a palmist, a clairvoyant and a feng shui geomancer, a
product of growing immigration from south-east Asia, who answers such
psycho-domestic problems as 'My son has painted his room purple and it's
giving off bad vibes. . .'
One of the elements keeping the country in touch with the world is the wine
industry, big and growing. On the plains to the south of the Marlborough
Sounds, the sun has proved perfect for ripening grapes. Though not hot
enough for reliable reds, the long, bright summers have produced
world-beating whites in only a decade.
The best known brand is Cloudy Bay but there are 21 vineyards in the region.
Most call themselves boutique wineries, and some have restaurants on site
where you can sit in the sun, eat, drink and count your blessings. The best
known variety is Sauvignon Blanc, but if you feel that drinking it is like
being pelted with ripe fruit, there are plenty of elegant Chardonnays and
Rieslings as well.
The region is rich in food, too: crayfish, apricots, olive oil,
strawberries, merino meat and more. It exports pumpkin seeds to America and
wasabe - a very hot Japanese mustard - to Japan. There are salmon farms
along the sounds, and 350 green-shell mussel farms.
Down the east coast is the town of Kaikoura, which was once a centre for the
early whalers.
Now you can go whale-watching with an operation run by local Maoris who take
you offshore to look for seals, dolphins and young, male sperm whales.
They sail year-round and claim a 95 per cent success rate, but the best time
is early in the morning before the winds spring up. When the boat draws
alongside a 50-ton whale lifting its tail in the air before quietly diving,
the sight is breath-taking. Very green, very New Zealand.
John Westbrooke was a guest of Air New Zealand and the New Zealand Tourism
Board. Return fares to Auckland start at around Pounds 900, cheaper at
bucket shops. The people are friendly, the roads empty, and motels
ubiquitous; but the sun can be fierce: summer is December to March. The
Mobil Travel Guides to the country (published by Reed, sometimes available
in Britain) are among the world's most exhaustive. The NZ Bed and Board Book
(Moonshine Press, New Zealand) is a good guide to homestays.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Outdoors: Massacre of the males - Beekeeping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERRY NORTHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
About a week after the local sheepdog trials, we begin to look for signs of
another rural ritual of subjugation - the massacre of the drones.
It comes around as regularly as autumn, bringing brutality and death to the
gentle world of the apiarist in a public display of gender atrocity. By the
time it becomes apparent to the onlooker, it is almost too late to save the
wretched victims from their fate.
Inside the hives, the worker bees have been deliberately keeping the drones
away from the stores of honey. The males are becoming desperate for food
and, although they are bigger than their sisters, they are heavily
outnumbered and starvation has weakened them to the point of only feeble
resistance. They know their time is up.
One by one they are led out into the daylight, and marched to the edge of
the entrance-board to be banished. The more fortunate are cast out close to
nightfall and die quickly of exposure. Others go on starving slowly for many
hours until the cold finishes them off.
Almost all of them put up a struggle, turning back repeatedly to the warmth
of the hive. They plough into the cluster of worker guards filling the
entrance, the drones using their size to retake lost ground. But the cluster
casually absorbs them and edges them out again until, exhausted, the drones
give up and fly away to their solitary deaths.
The guards then bring out their next victim and the ritual is repeated.
Eventually all the drones, perhaps 100 or 200, are driven out. The spectacle
of their extinction is made all the more pitiful by its slow pace and total
silence.
Inside, the rest of the colony is buzzing energetically over combs of
strongly-scented honey which they have just filled from the heather. The
slaughter is not part of an obvious battle for survival. The drones are not
killed while out raiding a strange hive for stores of honey. Drones cannot
be bothered to go robbing.
The killing-field for them is merely the ordained end of their life-cycle,
their form of death by natural causes.
By early autumn, drones are redundant to the active workforce. The sole
purpose of their short lives has been to wait around throughout the summer
in case one of them is needed to mate a new queen.
This is the only function in the complex life of the hive not undertaken by
its tens of thousands of worker bees, the only one at which they cannot
excel, since they are all female. But this makes a dull life for drones.
Untroubled by any useful tasks, they mooch about the face of the combs
getting in the way.
Occasionally they go out for a short fly-around, and visit a so-called Drone
Congregation Area, a spot high in the air which by some mysterious instinct
is known to local virgin queens. Now and then a virgin drops by looking for
a stray drone to join her in a mating-flight.
Drone Congregation Areas have defied scientific investigation. They seem to
be the honeybee equivalent of the cafe-bar in The Wild One where Marlon
Brando hangs out with the boys.
But these boys know their place, although such is the abundance of nature
that only a tiny number ever mates a queen. For the rest, a few months of
pointless existence leads only to a slow death once the hive decides it is
too late in the year for a new queen.
But there is a limit to this feeling of sympathy. Beekeepers generally
regard drones as a waste of space. We see through the eyes of our workers -
and they look like expensive luxuries in the struggle for survival. Indolent
passengers with big appetites.
So as the executions roll on, it is time to ease the top off a hive, shake a
honeycomb free of bees and head for the dining table with a grateful cheer
of 'up the workers'.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Travel: A history of enterprise in the Yorkshire Dales -
Adrian Gardiner on the stream of visitors that has left its mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sign says: 'Crackpot 2 miles', and as I drive the twisting lanes I muse
on interesting addresses. There is a village called Paradise in
Gloucestershire, one named Puddledub in Fife and, closer to home, a farm
called Phantassie.
Crackpot is in the Yorkshire Dales. Nineteenth-century travellers described
'awful caverns and frightful ravines' but where the rivers of Swale and Ure
have dissected England's Pennine backbone to give us Swaledale and
Wensleydale, the landscape has been tamed over the centuries. And since
nothing puts a place on the map quite like a TV series, the area has been
dubbed 'Herriot Country' after the television programme All Creatures Great
and Small and the well-known vet books.
Long before intensive farming necessitated veterinary surgeons, Norse
invaders took a liking to this land of rolling hills of layered limestone
and sandstone. They left behind curious place names: Muker, Reeth and
Crackpot (said to be a corruption of the Norse for 'pothole of the crows').
Later, in the Middle Ages, French monks came and constructed the great
abbeys of Fountains, Rievaulx and Jervaulx. They cleared forests and built
walls, establishing the topography we see today. These same monks brought
the recipe for the cheese which made Wensleydale famous.
Hawes, a typical mill and chapel village at the head of the dale, is home to
Wensleydale Dairy Products. Last June it opened a History of Cheese Museum,
winning the coveted White Rose award for best newcomer to tourism.
Another local enterprise, the rope works of WR Outhwaite, welcomes visitors
with demonstrations of traditional rope making.
From Hawes, a lonely road leads to Muker, another solid, pretty dales
village with a fine Victorian Literary Institute. Before the ascent over the
Buttertubs Pass - there are potholes by the roadside where market-bound
farmers stored their butter - we make a short detour to Hardraw Force.
'Stones of all colours and sizes encased in the clearest ice,' wrote
Wordsworth to Coleridge, 'I cannot express to you the enchanted effect
formed by this Arabian scene of colour.'
Entrance to this spectacular waterfall is through the back door of the Green
Dragon pub, following the track past an open-air bandstand which is the
venue for the Hardraw Brass Band Competition, a big Yorkshire event held
every September.
From Muker, the Swale flows through Gunnerside to Reeth, where Langhorn
House was Skeldale House in the original film All Creatures Great and Small.
Two roads follow the Ure east from Hawes and, in the film, the King's Arms
at Askrigg became the Drovers' Arms frequented by Siegfried, James and
Tristram.
Great Shunner Fell; Lovely Seat; Pen-Y-Ghent . . . few hills are higher than
2,000ft, yet there are tremendous panoramas and wide vistas of moorland
dotted with squat stone barns and blackfaced Swaledale sheep.
Walkers take the Pennine Way or follow the corpse roads: tracks designed for
funeral processions to cross the dales avoiding towns and villages. In a
superstition which survived from Norse times well into the last century, it
was believed that the deceased might be tempted by the sight of habitation
to return to the land of the living.
Walking these roads you see ruined huts and spoil heaps, relics of the
lead-mining industry. History records that soldiers defeated by the Romans
at the battle of Stanwick in AD74 were taken as slaves to the lead mines in
the dales. The observant will pick out hushes: man-made gullies created when
dams were broken up, letting water scour out the lead seams.
In places, stone quarrying has had a devastating effect on the landscape. As
a cottage industry consistent with local needs it was never a problem.
(Parts of Manchester are built of Hawes stone.) But today quarrying on a
massive scale has made ugly gashes in the land - and all this in a national
park.
We leave Wensleydale through the serviceable town of Leyburn, where houses
retain bricked-up windows, relics of the window tax. Nearby is Masham, the
place to wash down all that crumbly Wensleydale cheese. The village has two
breweries: Paul Theakston's Black Sheep brewery and his previous venture
Theakston's, now owned by Scottish &amp; Newcastle, and offering a visitor
centre and guided tours.
West of Masham is one of Yorkshire's best-kept secrets, hidden in a forest
near Healey: the Druid's Temple, an enclosure of towers, archways and huge
granite slabs, is the result of a job-creation project conceived by local
squire William Danby in the 1820s. It is atmospheric. It is eerie. It is
only a few miles from the massive trucks thundering along the main A1.
Herriot Country is good short-break territory. But Yorkshire's cities have
much to offer too. Largest is Leeds where, in the covered city market, Mr
Marks set up his penny bazaar which grew into one of Britain's largest chain
stores. Connoisseurs of industrial heritage can take a trip along the Leeds
and Liverpool canal, pausing in Bradford, tourism's success story of the
past decade.
Bradford's prime attraction is the six-storey National Museum of
Photography, Film and Television, which includes the advanced technology of
the Imax cinema with the largest screen in Britain. Many of the exhibits are
interactive: the children's favourite was a device which allows you to
remodel yourself digitally on a TV screen.
Also in Bradford - which has some remarkable inner-city architecture - is
the model mill village of Saltaire, built by a Victorian philanthropist.
Another wool town, Halifax, merits a visit. Eureka is a new, award-winning,
hands-on museum for younger children, while the Piece Hall, where merchants
once haggled over 'pieces' (sample lengths of cloth) is now an exhibition
centre. North of Halifax, the 50-mile Calderdale Way takes in gritstone
villages with packhorse bridges and Wuthering Heights country around
Haworth, once home to the Brontes.
York's attractions are well-documented. Visitors make for the Minster, the
National Railway Museum and the recreated Viking metropolis of the Yorvik
Centre. We wander through the web of narrow cobbled lanes lined with
half-timbered houses of bottle-glass windows and overhanging gables. We are
back in curious name territory, with streets called Whip-ma Whop-ma and The
Shambles.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Outdoors: Michaelmas daisies make the border - A look at a
variety that is now a curiosity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gardeners are having a heavenly autumn, but Michaelmas daisies are not in
everyone's heaven. By now, we all know that the famous varieties catch
mildew; the little ones look like pillows for a garden gnome; the reds are
not a true red and the blues are not always true blues. Sometimes they
flower well, but then they start to go back.
At the turn of the century, Michaelmas daisy borders were planted with
fondness in Edwardian walled gardens. Nowadays they are curiosities, and I
seldom see a garden where this family is used well. In one garden, though,
they have been bred and admired continuously. At Colwall, west of Malvern,
first-class asters go back through three generations on the same plot of
land.
Their story began with a skilled amateur named Ernest Ballard who became a
nurseryman when passers-by wanted pieces of his best varieties.
Many of his winners are still ours, named after ladies in the Ballard
family. He died in 1906 but, by a happy sequence, a family named Picton
bought the nursery and continued to improve it with excellent trees and
shrubs. Percy Picton had worked as a gardener with the great William
Robinson, author of The English Flower Garden, and lived until the 1980s. He
was also a great plantsman and, unusually, he encouraged his son to be the
same.
Paul Picton now runs Old Court Nurseries and looks after the national
collection of asters. It is open until October 31 from Wednesday mornings to
Sunday evenings; and although Michaelmas Day is the inevitable high point,
other varieties prolong the season beyond September 29 and still reward an
intelligent visit.
As we walked round the remarkable colours in his borders, Picton revealed
exactly how to cope with mildew. We should spray asters in May, using
Tumbleblight, and repeat the spraying once a month until September. I saw no
mildew in the huge national collection, although it grows dozens of the
modern varieties which go powder-grey for those of us who ignore the little
Tumbleblighters. I have no 'organic' scruples whatsoever: plants produce
chemicals, too, so why not use more chemicals to make them happy if these do
not damage the soil?
The aster family has always been a complicated tangle, but the biggest and
brightest are straightforward. They are all Novi-Belgi forms which are prone
to mildew and much happier on heavy soil. Picton recommends them on clay and
advises us to dress them with hoof and horn, a general fertiliser, each
spring.
Among the white varieties, Mount Everest is tall, but the best. The pinks
and reds appeal to me less but the shades of blue are irresistible. Viewing
Picton's collection, we singled out a short-list of Ada Ballard, Blue Eyes,
Helen Ballard and the late Blue Gown, which is reaching its peak only now.
This list would give you flowers from mid-August until late October.
All these varieties, and many others, can be ordered direct from Old Court
Nurseries for delivery in May. Since they are best planted as small, young
plants late in spring, this delivery time suits them.
If you have established asters of this type which no longer flower well,
they need to be divided. Throw away the centres of the old plants during
next spring and replant the young shoots from the outer margins. This simple
attention is essential for good results.
Those of us who funk the mildew usually turn instead to the Novi-Angliae
group because its members are immune. Six years ago we turned to them in
Oxford but, with one exception, their colours and shapes are definitely
second-best.
The exception is the amazing Alma Potschke, which is a brilliant cherry-red:
she is no bother and I love her, but her flowers have hardly opened this
year. Picton explained that she prefers a sunny September and that this wet
autumn has held her back.
Recently, my personal interest has come to rest on what books have described
as the also-rans. So often, there are forgotten winners among the great
mainstays of the Horticultural Index: pokers which are not red-hot,
agapanthus which are not Headbourne hybrids, dahlias with flowers that are
not shaggy.
Among the asters, I have come to prize the forms with small flowers or
Italian origins: the Picton collection shows dozens of them, which will be
at their best in the next fortnight.
They include Amellus asters, which I first came to know years ago when they
were growing in my rock garden. They have one huge advantage: they like dry,
well-drained soils - a necessary fact of Cotswold living - and they are
never very tall. The best of them would adorn my personal turf altars every
autumn.
In Germany, their resistance to dry weather suits the local steppe gardens
and has caused the breeders to develop new varieties which will be reaching
the UK soon. Meanwhile, the winners are violet-blue King George, pale
lavender Sternkugel, and the finely-cut flowers of the deep pink Jacqueline
Genebrier.
None catches mildew and I cannot think why gardeners do not plant them more
often. The one trick is to plant them out in spring and to split them into
clumps, not the single shoots which are enough for the tall varieties.
On other fringes of the family, the late Royal Horticultural Society flower
shows soon teach you where to look: the best cordifolius and laterfolius
forms extend the season right through October and remain worth cutting until
the middle of next month.
The National Trust is making widespread use of one variety called Little
Carlow, with sky-blue flowers. It is excellent, as the Picton collection
will show you, but is surpassed by a taller form - the remarkable Calliope,
with lilac-blue flowers that appear above black stems and green-black
leaves. Calliope is the outstanding plant of my autumn.
Unless you visit collections, you never see what lies neglected in the
by-ways of these great families. The smaller-flowered asters add an entire
extra month to the garden for people who do not want chrysanthemums all over
their flower beds. They are pretty in leaf and wonderful for cutting and
bringing indoors. But do not judge them by the flowers on the young plants
with which you begin. They need a year or two in order to reach their best.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (10): The best resorts in the world - Arnie
Wilson's guide to the finest skiing, the warmest welcomes, and the wildest
scenery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON

<TEXT>
FRANCE
ALPE D'HUEZ
Older, quieter and with more charm than its neighbour Les Deux Alpes, Alpe
d'Huez has an even more extensive ski area. The Grandes Rousses massif has
86 lifts, 107 runs and 140 miles of pistes. And as Les Deux Alpes has a
rustic 'back-door' to its ski area, Alpe d'Huez has two charming satellites
 -Vaujany and Oz - to which skiers can retreat at the end of the day.
The focal point of Alpe d'Huez is the Pic Blanc from which, the resort
claims, you can see one fifth of France.
Advanced and expert terrain (on and off-piste) radiates in all directions.
These include the long and challenging Tunnel, and Sarenne, plus testing
couloirs and faces around and beyond Pyramide, which should be skied with a
guide.
AVORIAZ
Another purpose-built French resort with controversial architecture. One of
the most dramatic French resorts, rearing up with its space-age tower blocks
from its cliff-top eyrie above its stablemate, Morzine.
Avoriaz is the gateway to the Portes du Soleil, a network of 13 ski areas
along the French/Swiss border, including the French resorts of Chatel,
Abondance, Les Gets and, in Switzerland, Morgins, Torgon, Les Crosets and
Champoussin. The circuit has 228 lifts serving more than 400 miles of
pistes.
Even the longest route (about 30 miles) can be covered in a day by fast
skiers.
The most famous run of the network is Chavanette, better known as the Swiss
Wall, from Avoriaz down to Les Crosets.
CHAMONIX / ARGENTIERE
Chamonix's Vallee Blanche is not the most difficult off-piste skiing on the
planet, but the scenery is out of this world.
It is also the only sensible way down from the Aiguille du Midi, a craggy
eyrie that towers above the old climbing town of Chamonix. The 'alternative'
North Face is so steep that it makes most skiers blanche. Building Europe's
highest cable car to this summit was a preposterous idea achieved against
impossible odds.
Chamonix has many attractions, including half a dozen ski areas, but most
'serious' skiers are drawn either to the Aiguille du Midi or Argentiere's
Grands Montets. Between these two massifs lies the Mer de Glace (the huge
sea of ice formed where glaciers converge) which forms the basis for the
main 22km Vallee Blanche descent.
Keep an eye on your guide's progress to avoid the myriad crevasses on the
Glacier de Geant. Your attention will be riveted by peaks, domes, needles,
pyramids and pinnacles.
The Grands Montets provides some of Europe's best skiing on and off-piste,
with a huge vertical drop and one run - Point du Vue - which allows skiers
to visit the portals of the seracs of the Glacier d'Argentiere.
COURCHEVEL/MERIBEL
Courchevel is an excellent ski resort, but why it is rated the most chic,
up-market and the most expensive in France is not clear. The flagship
village of Courchevel 1850 is not picture-postcard material. However, it has
several four-star hotels.
The less fashionable Courchevel 1650 has more rustic appeal: it is cheaper
and has plenty of good skiing, including the excellent off-piste Les Avals
itinerary reached after hiking from the top of Chanrossa.
Well-heeled skiers would not be seen anywhere but 1850, highest of the
resort's three main areas. Three of Courchevel's famous couloirs - Sous le
Telepherique, Grand and Emile Allais (all reached from the top of the
Saulire cable-car) are listed as black runs.
Much of Courchevel's skiing is good intermediate fare. There is an abundance
of nursery slopes.
Courchevel links with Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens to form the
Trois Vallees ski region, probably the biggest expanse of skiing in the
world.
Meribel (Mottaret and Les Allues) - which shelters between Courchevel and
Les Menuires at the heart of the three valleys - offers skiers wonderful
choice. In one direction they can make for Courchevel; in the other they can
head for Les Menuires, Val Thorens or St Martin de Belleville. Or they can
stay in Meribel and enjoy acres of good skiing there.
FLAINE
Traditionally Flaine, in the Grand Massif, shared with Tignes the
distinction of drawing more flak over its architecture than all the other
purpose-built French resorts, with only the attractive old town of Samoens
and the village of Les Carroz providing any real charm.
Flaine is ideal for beginners and intermediates, with trails linking Flaine
via Les Grands Vans with Samoens, Les Garroz and Morillon.
There is excellent off-piste for the more advanced, but the mountains around
Flaine are notorious for pot-holes. Take a guide.
LA PLAGNE
Brochure writers love to describe their resorts as 'an intermediates'
paradise'. La Plagne is the genuine article.
It is really a dozen hamlets and villages strung together in a vast maze of
skiing.
The flagship is Aime La Plagne, perched high above the resort. This
space-age ski city houses accommodation, restaurants, shops and a cinema but
is ugly.
The skiing is so extensive that those obsessed with achieving a daily
mileage can find their plans misfiring: there is a danger of spending too
much time on the vast lift network, especially for those who set their
sights on the Bellecote Glacier.
LES ARCS
When the French started to pioneer purpose-built ski resorts in the 1960s,
the results varied from good to bad to indifferent.
Les Arcs is reckoned a success, inspiring copy-cat resorts in other
countries.
The resort is split into three: Arc 1600, 1800 and 2000. The architecture is
brave and imposing.
The skiing is extensive and adventurous and dominated by the Aiguille Rouge
(11,240ft) above Arc 2000. Runs lead everywhere from the top, including the
celebrated 15km descent all the way to Villaroger, which starts off with
black or red alternatives but mellows.
Les Arcs is renowned for its off-piste skiing above and below the tree-line.
Some of it verges on the extreme. The resort is famous for its ski evolutif
(graduated length) teaching concept which allows beginners to start on very
short skis, gradually switching to longer ones.
LES DEUX ALPES/LA GRAVE
Les Deux Alpes is a bustling, brash and booming ski area with a huge British
following and an effervescent night life. Les Deux Alpes is a skiing
factory.
On the other side of the towering La Meije (13,065ft) is the silent and
beautiful glacier kingdom of La Grave with almost none of the normal
impedimenta of a ski resort.
La Grave is a picturesque climbing village invaded by a few tough,
thrill-seeking skiers there for the 7,000 vertical feet of steep, untracked
terrain. Only a 15 minute walk separates the areas but is sufficient to
discourage recreational skiers from wandering over from Les Deux Alpes.
Les Deux Alpes works in reverse compared with most resorts - the lower you
ski, the steeper the slopes.
It has a rustic backwater: skiers can reach the resort from the spectacular
valley below Venosc via an ancient two-seater gondola. St
Christophe-en-Oisans below Venosc is also the destination point of a
spectacular alternative to skiing La Grave.
From the Dome de la Lauze a guide will lead you down the magnificent Vallon
de la Selle, one of the most breathtaking descents in the Alps, though not
too demanding technically.
VAL D'ISERE/TIGNES
The Trois Vallees and Portes du Soleil are bigger, but Val d'Isere (with the
help of its neighbour Tignes, France's most famous summer ski area) may just
be the best ski resort in the world - at least for adventurous skiers: the
better the skier, the more extensive the challenging terrain.
The resorts swarm with specialist ski schools, among the best of which are
Top Ski (Val) and Evolution 2 (Tignes).
With their guides it is possible to spend a fortnight skiing off-piste and
scarcely touch a groomed run, except to ski from one off-piste area to
another. There is also excellent couloir skiing.
Intermediates can roam between the various areas - Le Fornet, La Daille and
Bellevarde in Val, Le Lac, Lavachet, La Grande Motte Glacier, Brevieres and
Val Claret in Tignes - without needing to ski a run twice, and both resorts
have world class bump skiing.
There is plenty for beginners. Tignes is purpose-built and not pretty, but
Val d'Isere has an old quarter.
The link between the two is manageable by most. Val d'Isere's big rival,
Courchevel, tends to attract older, richer clients: Val appeals to younger
skiers in search of challenging terrain and the liveliest nightlife. Dick's
T-Bar has long been the focal point for British skiers.
VAL THORENS/LES MENUIRES
Val Thorens, Europe's highest ski resort, is a big, exciting but sometimes
bleak ski area which like La Plagne and Flaine - is trying to soften its
image.
Both Val Thorens and its neighbour Les Menuires began as soulless
collections of concrete apartment blocks, but in the late 1980s and early
1990s have added rustic touches. Val Thorens now has a copper and pink
church and Les Menuires has attempted to make its satellite, Reberty,
prettier.
Further down the Belleville Valley and easy to get to on skis is St Martin -
a traditional, large village with exhilarating roller-coaster runs such as
Bethlehem and La Riondaz.
St Martin's rustic atmosphere provides a welcome contrast to the space-age
skiing of its higher neighbours.
Val Thorens' big attraction is the Cime de Caron (10,480ft) and a 160-person
cable car. The runs from the top are long and gruelling.
SWITZERLAND
ANDERMATT
Andermatt is one of those ski resorts where the village, river and tea-rooms
lull you into a sense of well-being, only to have it shattered by a mountain
to test the mettle of the toughest skier both on and off-piste. The
Gemmstock is a big, steep and uncompromising slab of rock: an awe-inspiring
place to ski.
The cable car half-way stage provides access to some of the limited
intermediate slopes, but there are less than a dozen lifts and these include
the satellite resorts of Hospental and Realp. For off-piste skiers,
Andermatt provides some of the best terrain in Switzerland.
There are classic off-piste itineraries, preferably skied with a guide, from
the summit. The most reliable method of reaching Andermatt is by motor-rail.
CRANS MONTANA
Switzerland's largest ski area - perched above the Rhone Valley between the
Matterhorn and Mont Blanc - has much exhilarating, picturesque, largely
intermediate skiing on long, wide-open cruising slopes.
The resort's lift system was upgraded for the 1987 world championships, and
allows skiers to cruise for hours along 100 miles of groomed runs with few
queue delays.
There are three ski areas: Les Violettes has most of the high, open slopes;
the glacier at Plaine Morte (9,840ft) has magnificent cross-country skiing
and scenery (it is also used for summer skiing and as a starting point for
ski tours); and Cry d'Err-Bella Lui and Aminona-Petit Bonvin have an
assortment of slopes above and below the tree line.
The resort's one official black run is above La Toula.
Crans is newer, smarter and more expensive with the inevitable luxury
boutiques.
Montana is older and more rustic.
DAVOS/KLOSTERS
Davos is like a gentle giant (or perhaps something of an ugly duckling
compared with its genteel smaller cousin) that puts up with the
international notoriety of Klosters.
Klosters depends on Davos for its skiing clout, though the notorious
Gotschna Wang run is in Klosters terrain, with other spectacular runs such
as Drostobel, a challenging black run which like the 'Wang' links the Davos
slopes with Klosters.
Davos, with its superb Parsenn area, has by far the most significant
terrain. As Europe's highest ski town it has little of Switzerland's alpine
charm, but the Parsenn-Weissfluh section - the size of Manhattan with long
runs all the way down to Kublis, 14km away - is the envy of Europe.
Jakobshorn and Rinerhorn have their own ski areas and provide good
intermediate slopes plus challenging runs and good off-piste, while Madrisa
offers sunny, easy skiing, and a ski touring route for excursions across the
Austrian border to Gargellen.
FLIMS/LAAX
This is an unfamiliar part of Switzerland to most British skiers, and
deserves wider recognition.
The combined ski area of Flims and Laax is greater than the sum of its parts
and is jointly marketed as the White Arena.
The two ski areas - traditional rivals - are knitted together by La Siala,
but the most popular link is at the bottom of a steep valley at Plaun. It is
a sunny spot for lunch and a good cross-over point for better skiers.
Higher up at Crap Sogn Gion, less experienced skiers will find a crossroads
of blue runs. With almost 140 miles of pistes, it is a large area of mainly
intermediate skiing, much of it above the tree line, where in good weather
the skiing can be superb.
In cold weather the slopes are very exposed, but skiers can always escape to
the long runs through the trees lower down.
On the Flims side there is tougher skiing in a huge open bowl from the top
of the Cassons cable-car (8,775ft) which in powder is outstanding.
In Laax, experts will enjoy the long black Sattel run from Vorab (9,900ft)
and two long black runs from Crap Sogn Gion, Muladera and Fatschas. Bill
Kidd is a gem for intermediates. It is only a blue, but hugely enjoyable.
And the run from Vorab to Flims is almost nine miles long.
GRINDELWALD/WENGEN
Magnificent scenery more than compensates for bland skiing in this idyllic
area of the Bernese Oberland that has long been a favourite with the
British.
Soon after the first world war - long before the first ski-lifts - they used
the arrival of the mountain railway to provide a ride up the mountain to aid
their madcap skiing antics.
Here the spectacular trio of the Eiger, Monch (Monk) and Jungfrau (the
maiden, guarded from the fearsome ogre by the monk as The Good Skiing Guide
puts it) plus the impressive Finsteraarhorn and Wetterhorn are so close that
they dominate the sky-line.
The ski area's focal point is Kleine Scheidegg, a plateau mid-way between
Grindelwald and Wengen.
The skiing is extensive and good intermediate standard, with little to test
the expert except occasionally good powder skiing.
There is some of the best helicopter skiing in the world close by, and
excellent off-piste terrain can be reached on skins via the Aletsch Glacier.
SAAS-FEE
Saas means meadow and Fee was once claimed to mean 'fairylike'.
Once labelled 'the most abominable wild region of Switzerland', this very
remoteness now attracts visitors to the 'glacier village'.
In 1849 the parish priest skied on wooden boards to Saas-Grund to care for a
dying man. They were the first ski tracks in Switzerland. Not until the road
was built in 1951 - replacing travel by mule - did it become a serious ski
area.
The main reason for Zermatt's popularity is the Matterhorn; Saas-Fee has the
Dom, the highest mountain in Switzerland.
The resort's glaciers give it a unique appeal. The terrain is riddled with
cavities: yawning crevasses and smaller, more rounded holes where marmots
live. Marmots hibernate, but the Fee glacier never sleeps, moving
relentlessly more than 20cm a day.
The resort has superimposed an extensive ski area on the marauding ice.
ST MORITZ/PONTRESINA
St Moritz - where the British invented winter sports - is an institution
that should be experienced in all its facets: a drink at the Palace, tea at
the venerable (but not so glitzy) Kulm, with its glass-cabinets packed with
Cresta trophies, lunch at the Marmite restaurant (specialising in truffles
and caviar) at Corviglia - and then a hasty call to your bank manager to see
whether you can still afford a lift ticket.
St Moritz is expensive, but no more so than any big Swiss resort. The skiing
is scattered among three basic areas: Corviglia (easiest slopes, easiest to
get to from the town centre); Corvatsch (bigger, tougher better ski area,
but a car or bus ride away with serious queuing at base area); and
Pontresina (magnificent scenery, but can be bleak and windswept).
ZERMATT
With good snow and a blue sky, Zermatt is one of the world's most
magnificent ski resorts. In bad weather, when the Matterhorn's glories are
hidden in cloud, it can also be one of the bleakest. But the resort has so
many mountain huts and restaurants that even the bad days usually turn out
good and the town itself has plenty to offer skiers returning early from the
slopes.
Zermatt - particularly the Sunegga, Rothorn/Gornergrat area - has a lot of
sunshine. However, it is nearly always cold on the Theodul Glacier
(Zermatt's summer skiing area) and the run down to Cervinia from here or via
the spectacular Klein Matterhorn cable-car for a plate of spaghetti across
the Italian border can be a chilly and windswept experience.
The Matterhorn dominates the resort and its legends, but it is only one of
many important peaks in the area. You can gaze out across the
Gornergletscher on a row of dramatic summits including Monte Rosa, the
highest. It is best to ski only one of Zermatt's three principal ski areas
each day or valuable skiing time will be lost in transit.
The Good Skiing Guide sums up Zermatt's skiing: 'Good for experts, excellent
for intermediates and ghastly for beginners.'
That is a harsh judgment of Zermatt's nursery slopes, but certainly the
stronger the skier, the more Zermatt has to offer. There is usually an easy
alternative to the tougher runs.
Skiers looking for the most difficult way down will relish runs such as
National and Triftji, whether mogulled or mantled with fresh powder. The
town is car-free, with electric carts or horse-drawn sleighs. Smart hotels,
cosy tea-rooms and nightclubs abound.
VERBIER
Verbier is one of the world's greatest ski resorts, and this winter the
area's one flaw - the lift queues that spring partly from popularity, partly
from antiquity of one or two chief lifts - will be thinned out (though not
eradicated) by the opening of the new 'jumbo' gondolas.
Another way to enjoy Verbier without queues is to ski in the spring, when
conditions are almost always superb but the crowds have vanished.
Even without roaming around the area's 'Four Valleys' taking in Nendaz,
Veysonnaz, La Tzoumas and Thyon (250 miles of skiing with almost 100 lifts),
there is a wealth of skiing in Verbier itself.
The strong skier will relish Verbier's terrain. The variety of challenges
are almost endless: Tortin, with its tricky traverse followed by a face
steep enough to give even experts a good work-out, the glorious plunging
powder fields of Col des Mouches further round from Tortin, the Gentianes
bump run, one of the toughest in the Alps, ditto Mont-Font (steeper but not
as long).
Verbier is also renowned for its glorious off-piste.
VILLARS/DIABLERETS
There are many skiers living in Montreux, Lausanne and other places along
the north shore of Lake Geneva (or Lac Lemon as it is known by the locals)
but apart from some small ski areas such as the Rochers de Naye and Jaman
there are no big resorts until one reaches the far eastern corner of the
lake where the Dents du Midi form such a spectacular backdrop.
Bretaye (5,900ft) reached by the Eisenbahn Railway, is the hub of the ski
area, with slopes on three flanks: Roc d'Orsay (also reached by gondola from
the village), Grand Chamossaire (6,950ft) and Petit Chamossaire (both with
excellent off-piste opportunities) on one side; Les Chaux and Crois des
Chaux (6,625ft) opposite; and the Chaux de Conches chair below Isenau, the
link with Diablerets, to the north.
AUSTRIA
ISCHGL
Big ski area. Small town. Surprisingly small considering that Ischgl, after
a late start as a significant ski area (its first cable-car was only
constructed in 1963, bringing prosperity to a struggling community) is now
as popular with the Austrians as St Anton and Kitzbuhel.
The reason it has not sprawled farther along the Paznaun valley is simple:
the avalanche danger is too great.
The result is that Ischgl, in spite of its growing international reputation,
remains unspoiled.
The ski area, 125 miles of pistes served by 40 lifts, links with the
duty-free village of Samnaun in Switzerland, and there is a long history of
smuggling celebrated brazenly today with the 'Smugglers Cup' event in which
participants are handed a 'secret' package to smuggle past customs
officials.
The slopes, set in strikingly attractive scenery, are in the so-called
'Silvretta Hole', which normally guarantees good snow.
The skiing area - mainly long, swooping, well-groomed motorway runs -
provides superb intermediate terrain but also plenty for beginners and
experts.
Unfortunately all this can be marred by serious queuing at peak times.
Hemingway was a regular visitor in the mid-l920s.
KITZBUHEL
Kitzbuhel is a perplexing resort that is raved about by its fans but can
also be slandered by its critics.
With its medieval walled centre, pastel wash facades, cobbled streets,
frescoes and decorative archways, 'Kitz' is perhaps the most attractive of
the more substantial Austrian resorts.
And with three distinct ski areas, plus the most feared World Cup downhill
in the world, the Streif on the Hahnenkamm, it would seem to have a strong
suit of skiing possibilities.
And yet one great descent does not make a world-class ski resort (although
few would deny that it is one).
Kitzbuhel's detractors are quick to point out its flaws: lack of height (the
town is at only 800m), fairly bland skiing; serious lift queue problems; and
rowdy visitors who make the most of Kitzbuhel's 25 bars, pubs and discos.
This year - not for the first time - Kitzbuhel was hit by a combination of
low altitude and a hot March. Yet in other years it has often got away with
a better snow record than its lowly altitude would promise.
Although the various different areas are fairly widely spread, the bus
service linking them is efficient and many skiers quite like the opportunity
of trying a different area or approach route every other day or so.
LECH/ZURS
'Top class elsewhere means nothing here.' This somewhat conceited boast of
the Arlberg ski schools of Lech, Zurs and St Anton might also apply to the
self-perceived grandeur of Lech's clientele.
So what is so special about Lech, that this remote, impoverished hamlet, cut
off during the winter, now attracts Europe's royalty (including, of course,
the Princess of Wales) and so many millionaire skiers?
The ski area, which with that of neighbouring Zurs provides an enjoyable and
moderately challenging clockwise-only circuit, is good without being
exceptional, although a guide will find you some excellent off-piste,
particularly from the Rufikopf.
Lech has the mighty slopes of St Anton, which its snootier clients find a
double edged sword, on its doorstep.
Zurs, although much the more recent of the two, has some history of its own:
it was the location of Austria's first 'cable-operated hoist for ski users'
 -draglift, in other words.
The Zurs slopes are higher and entirely above the tree-line. Lech's tend to
be more wooded and gentler. All in all, the epitome of a good Austrian
skiing holiday.
MAYRHOFEN/HINTERTUX
Sex and snow seem inextricably linked at Mayrhofen, where the resort has
taken to selling itself through innuendo.
Beneath its catchy 'lead me into temptation' headline in the resort
literature we see both a map of the extensive ski areas, plus a back-view of
a topless skier sunning herself on a mountain top.
Like Zermatt, Mayrhofen has become a victim of its own success, and has all
but lost its original charm, in spite of its beautiful setting in the
Zillertal.
Yet it remains an excellent ski resort. In spite of its low altitude (the
village is barely 2,000ft), the ski slopes are much higher. There are three
different areas (Ahorn, Penken and Horberg/Gerent) with slopes as high as
7,380ft and almost 60 miles of groomed runs. Queuing can still be a serious
problem, but a big investment in new snow-cannon at Penken and Hornberg
started to pay off as soon as they were switched on last winter.
However, even in the worst of snow years there is always the glacier at
Hintertux, which also provides some of the best summer skiing in Europe
which many of the national skiing teams take full advantage of.
MONTAFON VALLEY
Gargellen is 'ideal for ski tours'. True. It is right on the Swiss border
and a highlight for skiers is the Madrisa tour to or from Klosters.
For some reason (mainly a lack of sufficient beds), very few British tour
operators pay much attention to this beautiful valley in the Vorarlberg.
The valley is dotted with substantial ski resorts that all sound vaguely
similar: Gaschurn, St Gallenkirch and Gortipohl are linked and market
themselves as the Silvretta Nova (the mountain range dominating the valley)
while Gargellen, Schruns and Tschagguns tend to go it alone. But the whole
region is available on a joint lift pass, and linked by a free ski-bus
service.
Altogether the region has more than 100 miles of groomed runs served by
almost 80 lifts, not counting the Madrisa tour or the heli-skiing areas,
which makes it one of Austria's biggest skiing regions.
OBERGURGL/SOLDEN
These high-altitude resorts are not quite linked but close to one another
and comprise the heart of the Otztal region, one of Austria's biggest
year-round tourist attractions.
Obergurgl is a classic British enclave (as many as a fifth of its regular
clients are British) with perhaps almost as many faithful returnees as the
Swiss resort of Wengen, with which it shares something else in common: a lot
of intermediate cruising with little in the way of serious challenges.
Perhaps this is the attraction]
One run that can be a little daunting with poor or icy snow cover is the
Hohe Mut at almost 9,000ft, served by an ancient single chair (the
restaurant at the top is usually uncrowded and there are magnificent views)
but in good snow there is a hugely enjoyable off-piste run off the back.
With Hochgurgl, its close neighbour, Obergurgl is the highest ski village in
Austria. In Europe, only Val Thorens in France's Trois Vallees is higher.
Solden, linked with Obergurgl by post-bus, is a very different prospect:
much busier, noisier and with a more international flavour. Like Obergurgl,
it has a separate 'hoch' village but the skiing, which is mainly
intermediate is properly linked.
The resort has considerable snow-making, but in the event of a serious lack
of snow its trump card is the glacier skiing at Rettenbach and Tiefenbach.
SAALBACH/HINTERGLEMM
For many British skiers, Saalbach-Hinterglemm was not just the first place
where the slopes made them grin from ear-to-ear but the resort where the
grin sometimes lasted all week.
With a ski-circuit of 200km (skiable in both directions) linking the two
villages and both sides of the valley, the area is a genuine intermediates'
paradise. Even good beginners can manage easier versions of the ski-circuit,
but there is also some quite challenging terrain (particularly on the
Zwolferkogel) and some good off-piste, for strong skiers.
With no fewer than eight ski schools, 30 four-star hotels and 65
restaurants, the resort has plenty of variety by day and by night: but it is
not cheap. With tea-dances (sometimes the participants are still wearing
their ski boots) and discos aplenty, Saalbach-Hinterglemm can also be
something of a circus by night.
Little of the original rustic ambience remains, and the two villages are
effectively one and the same.
ST ANTON
St Anton may not be quite as pretty as Kitsbuhel, its main rival, but it
wins hands down on its skiing, especially for the type of skier who likes a
thigh-punishing, challenging day coupled with sublime scenery.
At busy times, lift queues can still be a problem, but one has to adjust to
the fact that the sort of queue that once made you groan when spotted from
afar can melt away in three or four minutes when it is assembled at the
entrance to a high-speed quad chair.
Hence the recently installed Zammermoos quad makes mincemeat of lift-lines
that used to clog up this vital artery to St Anton's prime skiing on the
Valluga Grat and send you in retreat to ski Kapall instead.
Apart from the Valluga - where everyone regarding themselves as good skiers
wants to be - there is a huge network of cruising runs (160 miles of groomed
runs in the St Anton/Arlberg region, plus almost as much off-piste).
Do not miss the long run down to the delightful village of Stuben, and be
sure to visit St Christoph (but not via the Arlenmahder]). Lech and Zurs are
available on the same lift ticket, but you must get there by road unless you
want to pay for a guide and ski one of the steepest and toughest runs in
Austria off the back of the Valluga down to Zurs]
SOLL
Snooty skiers tend to dismiss - and bypass - Soll as a mass-market ski
circus, yet the skiing is probably as good as that of Lech and Zurs where
many snooty skiers ski.
The best aspect of Soll's skiing is the joy (snow conditions permitting) of
being able to ski the whole of the Ski-Welt Wilder Kaiser-Brixental region.
You can ski from one resort to another, taking in Hopfgarten, Brixen, Going,
Ellmau, Scheffau and Itter. The tour, never particularly difficult, can
easily be accomplished in a day, and can be most rewarding for early
intermediates who have never enjoyed the novelty of travelling from one
village to another on skis. Faster skiers can take their pick from 90 lifts
and more than 150 miles of pistes.
Soll, with a much-improved flow of skiers to its middle-station since the
installation of a modern gondola, has a considerable amount of good
intermediate runs, and there are some challenging off-piste descents from
the top of the Hohe Salve (7,000ft).
ITALY
BORMIO
Bormio is traditionally the Italian resort that British skiers went to in
the old days.
It went off the boil after the 1985 World Championships, but with extended
snowmaking there seems to be a revival of interest in this medieval spa
town, which is part old world and part charmless suburb.
Bormio's lift ticket also covers two other traditional British favourites,
Santa Caterins and Livigno, as well as Valdisotto and and Valdidentro.
The skiing, which strangely boasts 20 lifts but only 19 runs, is ideal for
families and intermediates; extensive, but not very difficult, with a
significant vertical drop of 5860ft (the longest run, Cima Bianca, a blue,
is almost nine miles).
A two-stage cable car takes skiers to the slopes of Monte Vallecetta
(9,880ft). From here there are several options down to Bormio 2000.
CERVINIA
Most skiers know Cervinia as a day excursion across the Swiss border from
Zermatt, but it is a destination resort in its own right, with good,
uncomplicated high-altitude cruising, and mountain restaurants serving
appetising if pricey fare.
Cervinia also has good views of the 'wrong' side of the Matterhorn. Once
known as Breuil, traditionally Zermatt's rival as a climbing centre, it was
revamped by Mussolini, taking its new name from Mont Cervin, the alternative
name for the Matterhorn.
According to The Good Skiing Guide, Cervinia was 'once the showpiece of
Italian ski resorts, a gleaming contemporary development where cable cars
swept skiers to unprecedented heights and Italy's elite flocked to enjoy the
novelty. Then they moved on, while Cervinia's lift system lapsed into
disrepair.'
There are signs of a comeback. The resort has been given a facelift, and a
huge new cable-car was recently installed carrying 140 skiers to Plateau
Rosa, the summer skiing area and link with Zermatt. (The links are not
always open and can be very cold.)
From Plateau Rosa the main run down is the celebrated Ventina, a five-mile
descent which the whole family can ski.
CORTINA D'AMPEZZO
Cortina d'Ampezzo is a self-indulgent ski resort like Zermatt, Kitzbuhel,
Megeve or Aspen where you can pamper yourself without ever needing to go
near a pair of skis. That is reflected on the mountain: even when Cortina is
packed with winter tourists, parading down the Corso Italia precinct in
their fur coats and jewellery, there are rarely (unlike Zermatt and
Kitzbuhel) queues on the slopes.
With wonderful scenery, a cosmopolitan and picturesque town centre and
excellent skiing for beginners and intermediates, it is a true international
winter sports resort although since hosting the 1956 Winter Olympics it has
not been at the forefront of international skiing.
There is one more similarity with Zermatt: the skiing (up to almost
10,000ft) is spread out in three different areas in the mountains, and
travelling between them all is inconvenient. It is best to stay in one or
another, although you can at least get from Faloria, one of the most popular
family areas, to Staunies (good steep skiing above Monte Cristallo) on skis.
The nearest area to the town centre is Tofana/Socrepes. The third section of
the cable car does not reach the ski slopes but provides a haven for
sightseers and sunbathers.
Cortina is close to but not fully linked with the Sella Ronda circuit of ski
areas which makes an enjoyable and extremely scenic day-long tour. The link
can be made via one of Cortina's small satellites, Passo Falzarego, along a
seven-mile red run down to Armentarola near San Cassiano.
COURMAYEUR
For some skiers, Courmayeur is a delightful bijou resort with fun skiing and
temptingly good mountain restaurants. For others the attraction is the
challenge of the Italian side of Mont Blanc.
Courmayeur, with a climbing history inextricably entwined with that of
Chamonix, combines both images successfully. The main route to Courmayeur's
skiing is in the resort's giant cable car to Plan Checrouit (5,600ft) where
skis and boots can be stored.
The short but challenging Checrouit runs - in a sizeable bowl - form the
heart of Courmayeur's skiing. That area links with Val Veny, where the
wooded, north-facing slopes tend to hold their snow better, and the runs are
longer and more challenging. Another area, Cresta d'Arp has some good
off-piste.
This is good practice for Courmayeur's real challenge, the elderly
three-stage cable cars that take you from outlying Entreves to Punta
Helbronner (11,325ft). From here there are dramatic views around the Mont
Blanc massif and all kinds of exciting options, all of which require the
services of a guide.
The obvious descent is the Italian version of the Vallee Blanche, returning
by bus from Chamonix.
The Toula Glacier back to Entreves is another popular itinerary, and there
are several steep chutes and gulleys below the cable-car.
SELVA
Selva, also known as Wolkenstein, is the best known resort in an area of the
Dolomites which has had something of a split personality ever since it
became embroiled in bitter fighting when Italy entered the war against
Austria in 1915, splitting the Tyrol.
Towns that were part of the Austrian sud-Tyrol, acquired two names - one
Italian, one German.
Today, with its man-made snow system, Selva, in the Val Gardena, features
early in the World Cup circuit.
It is more famous, however, as the starting point in the Sella Ronda.
This is a gentle, enjoyable jaunt on skis through or around as many as a
dozen resorts in the four valleys surrounding the Gruppo Sella, a huge
mountain surrounded by ancient pass routes linking dozens of old villages.
The tour provides a scenic day out rather than a skiing challenge.
The limestone Dolomites differ from the Alps: the monoliths tower above the
ski fields, turning a dramatic shade of pink as the sun begins to set.
Selva is also part of the vast Dolomiti Superski region which covers 38
resorts served by 464 lifts, all of which can be used on one lift pass.
Most of the skiing traverses the contours of the Dolomites, but a few severe
runs take a more vertical path and should only be skied with a guide.
US
ALTA, UTAH
Alta is a cult ski area. Serious skiers speak of it in hushed tones. It may
not be as big as Vail or have Jackson Hole's vertical drop, and it is not a
destination resort, though less than an hour from Salt Lake City's airport.
But when it comes to deep, dry powder it has few equals (one is Snowbird
only a mile down Little Cottonwood Canyon).
It has some good intermediate slopes such as Big Dipper and Rock and Roll,
but Alta is famous for steep ungroomed chutes, on and off the trail map.
The Greeley Bowls and the chutes off Spiney Ridge are attractions: to ski
these in fresh powder - or even in falling snow - is the stuff of an
off-piste skiers' dreams. High Rustler is another.
Yet the resort has one of the cheapest lift passes in the Rockies. (Many old
hands hike to secret powder caches.)
ASPEN, COLORADO
Aspen needs to be de-mystified. Although there is nominally no beginner
terrain on Aspen's most famous mountain, Ajax, the skiing is not
outrageously macho or difficult. It is a great mountain for anyone who can
ski with a modicum of skill.
The reason beginners are advised not to ski Ajax is because the homeward
bound runs at the end of the day are like race-tracks.
The town of Aspen may be pricey, but it is not snooty. There is not a single
place in town - even the Caribou Club - where a tie is de rigueur. And film
stars who turn up at local restaurants are treated like anyone else.
The four mountains - Ajax, Buttermilk, Highlands (added to the Aspen Ski
Company's portfolio last year) and Snowmass - offer diverse good skiing,
with few rivals in the Rockies.
BRECKENRIDGE, COLORADO
Breckenridge carves out a big slice of the British ski market.
Its attractions are easy to list: four different ski mountains (Peaks 7,8,9
and 10); a charming main street, with 350 original Victorian buildings
renovated or reconstructed; good restaurants; and proximity to the other
'Ski The Summit' areas of Keystone, Copper Mountain, and Arapahoe Basin. It
is also only 85 miles from Denver.
The four mountains are quite different: Peak 8, the first to open, has
terrain for all grades of skier, including Imperial Bowl, the highest
in-bounds skiing in the USA at slightly less than 13,000ft.
Peak 9 is more gentle (with a few nasty surprises) and Peak 10 has more
difficult terrain.
CRESTED BUTTE, COLORADO
Crested Butte is a paradox: it is small yet marketed internationally, and
has some of the gentlest and most challenging skiing in the Rockies. Its
fame comes from its extreme skiing and two celebrities from very different
backgrounds.
Bill Johnson, America's first Olympic downhill gold-medallist (Sarajevo,
1984) and amiable enfant terrible, has been the resort's 'ski ambassador'
for some years, and former president Carter and his wife Rosalyn are regular
visitors.
Crested Butte has one of the biggest programmes for disabled skiers in the
country. It is also celebrated for its free skiing for all comers at the
start of the season - a way of attracting skiers to spend money in the shops
and hotels from mid-November to mid-December. (This gimmick is beginning to
attract the wrong kind of clientele.) Few resorts can offer both such
pussy-cat and petrifying skiing.
HEAVENLY, CALIFORNIA
Like the breathtakingly beautiful lake it overlooks, Heavenly ski area is
intersected by the California-Nevada border, which gives the resort an odd
stereoscopic ambiance.
The two views from the top of Monument Peak are startlingly different (Lake
Tahoe on the California side and the Nevada Desert on the other) and the
base area of South Lake Tahoe also contrasts wildly.
On the California side of the stateline, gambling is illegal. The Nevada
side, however, is a Las Vegas-like miasma of light-bulbs announcing vast
hotel-casinos and gambling joints.
In winter, sunny California days often produce low temperatures at night.
Heavenly makes the most of this with one of the biggest snow-making systems
in the country. Two thirds of the area's boasted 150 miles of trails have
snowmaking.
Heavenly's terrain in both states is good intermediate cruising, but on the
Nevada side Mott Canyon and the recently opened Killebrew Canyon provide an
ungroomed enclave for experts.
In fresh powder, Heavenly's skiable terrain expands further when tree skiing
is possible among the stunted white-barked pines.
JACKSON HOLE (WYOMING)
Jackson Hole ski resort at Teton Village has built a reputation as one of
the best ski areas in the US.
It is not only the skiing, dynamic though it is, or the vertical drop of
4,139ft (not high by European standards, but the biggest in the US).
It is the mix of slopes and scenery (the magnificent Teton mountain range);
wildlife (moose, coyotes and America's largest elk reserve); wild-west
atmosphere (wooden sidewalks and cowboy bars in the town of Jackson, 10
miles away); and wilderness (Yellowstone National Park is not far away) that
provides Jackson's addictive atmosphere.
Jackson is mainly for intermediates and experts in search of excitement and
'air' as the Americans describe 'lift off' on skis.
Jackson's most famous chute is Corbet's Couloir, where skiers must leap
anything from 12ft to 20ft.
MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, CALIFORNIA
This ancient volcano is one of America's biggest ski resorts - six miles
from one end to the other, divided into four areas. It is in a remote and
wild part of the Eastern Sierras not far from Yosemite, arguably America's
most beautiful national park, which you can visit from late May.
There is often plenty of sunshine. Mammoth has dramatic scenery of its own,
especially the jagged, toothy Minarets.
The resort is 300 miles from Los Angeles where most of its clients come
from. If it were much nearer, even Mammoth's extensive slopes (30 lifts
serving almost 150 runs) would be in danger of being over-run.
Many Los Angelinos and San Franciscans drive for six hours to get there at
weekends.
There is a lot of challenging skiing (Avalanche Chutes, Wipe Out, Paranoids
and Gravy Chute) but plenty of easy-does-it cruising runs too, such as St
Anton, Broadway and Forest Trail. A sister resort, June Mountain, with
easier trails, is only half an hour away.
Mammoth did not get its name as a result of being so spread out. During a
gold rush in the late 1870s one mining company so dominated local claims
that it was called the Mammoth Mining Company.
SNOWBIRD, UTAH
Snowbird has almost everything: excellent snow (500in a year); challenging
bowls, one of the widest intermediate trails in the country (Big Emma); a
large, fast cable-car (eight minutes to the top of Hidden Peak - 11,000ft);
and attractive scenery: it is also only 29 miles from Salt Lake City
international airport, which means that you can get a full day's skiing on
your arrival day and leave late on your last day.
If Snowbird has a flaw, it is its purpose-built architecture, dominated by
the Cliff Lodge, a steel and glass monolith with 532 rooms: in European
terms, Snowbird is more Flaine than Filzmoos.
Snowbird's most challenging in-bounds skiing is in its steep-sided bowl
areas: Gad Valley and Peruvian Gulch, where chutes serve as launching pads
for those who like the 'free-fall' dimension of skiing.
Those who prefer a quieter existence can still take the tram and ski Chip's
Run, enjoying the same vertical drop and scenery as more aggressive skiers
who opt for the Silver Fox or Primrose Path descents. Skiing Snowbird after
a fresh fall of snow is exhilarating.
SQUAW VALLEY, CALIFORNIA
Of 15 ski areas scattered around the shores of Lake Tahoe - a spectacular
stretch of water 12 miles wide and 22 miles long - Squaw Valley, at the
North Shore, is the most challenging.
Squaw's six mountains encompass every conceivable terrain: from the alarming
moguls on the steep face of KT22 to the nursery slopes at High Camp on
Emigrant Peak.
Squaw also has some 'radical' skiing off the Pallisades, the setting for
many of the leaps that end up in gung-ho ski videos.
Squaw places emphasis on skiing more or less anywhere on 4,000 acres of
open-bowl terrain rather than specific runs, but it does claim 100 miles of
trails.
KT22, Snow King, and Granite Chief provide almost entirely challenging
terrain, while Squaw and Emigrant Peaks are benign. The other mountain,
Broken Arrow, has a good mix of trails.
Squaw claims to have the biggest fleet of grooming machines in North
America, and its 33 lifts can carry almost 50,000 skiers an hour.
SUN VALLEY, IDAHO
Sun Valley is perhaps the only American ski resort with more mystique than
Aspen. In its day, it had film stars, senators and celebrities flocking to
its slopes like butterflies to buddleias.
They came by train and stayed at the Sun Valley Lodge, often as guests of
the resort. The resort was built by Averell Harriman, president of the Union
Pacific Railway, after a long search to find a resort which would attract
passengers during the lean winter months.
Mount Baldy is a mountain with a good steep pitch and more than half a dozen
bowls and a wealth of intermediate cruising runs.
A chief snow-making programme and a luxurious new mountain restaurant,
Seattle Ridge Lodge, have helped put Sun Valley back on the map.
TAOS, NEW MEXICO
Ernie Blake, a German-born Swiss who worked as an interrogator for Allied
Intelligence in the war, invented this surreal enclave in the middle of New
Mexico's Sangre de Cristo mountains 20 miles from the adobe town of Taos and
the breathtaking Rio Grande Gorge.
He invited the brothers Mayer to help him run the ski school and threw in a
few British trail names. The result: an exotic mixture of cultural
influences from European to Pueblo Indian that has made Taos a cult resort.
There is a lot of good, steep skiing, but new arrivals can be daunted by the
apparent steepness of Al's Pun.
The easy skiing does exist: runs like Bambi and White Father are delightful.
Then there are steeper runs than Al's. The reason good skiers come to Taos
is for the steep, deep and ungroomed. The scalps that every 'serious' skier
wants to collect are difficult to get to and to get down: the so-called
Ridge Runs.
One of the best is Thunderbird Trees. The most challenging skiing is off
Kachina Peak, which is rarely open and involves a hike of at least an hour.
Blake, who died four years ago, swore he would never ruin it by building
lifts there.
TELLURIDE, COLORADO
Act One, Scene One: native American indians roam this wild but idyllic box
canyon in a remote corner of South West Colorado. Scene Two: silver is
discovered, the indians are dispossessed and a wild mining community springs
up, huddled beneath the mighty San Juan Mountains. Boom turns to slump and
thriving mining town becomes windswept semi-ghost town.
Act Two - The Present: Telluride becomes a sophisticated cult ski resort and
claims to be 'the most beautiful place you will ever ski'. Telluride, where
Butch Cassidy robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank in 1889, with a red-light
district which was never short of customers, has turned respectable - almost
genteel. Yet in the old main street, dominated by the 'New' Sheridan Hotel,
little has changed.
The ski slopes, famously steep in places such as Gold Hill and the Face  -
black-diamond trails off lifts 7,8 and 9 (you can see Telluride between your
ski boots if you look down from The Plunge) - also have acres of carefree
cruising such as See For Ever.
San Joaquin Village is surrounded by some of the easiest skiing.
VAIL/BEAVER CREEK, COLORADO
For many, Vail is the best all-round ski area in North America. It is one of
the largest, claiming to be the biggest single-mountain resort in the US.
Critics who claim Vail's skiing is bland in spite of its size get a
five-letter word in response: bowls.
Vail has some of the best back-bowls in North America - seven altogether:
Game Creek, Sun Up, Sun Down, Tea Cup, and more recently, China, Siberia and
Mongolia Bowls. More open next year.
These areas, shaped like large soup-bowls, are left ungroomed in the hope
that they will be filled with fluffy powder or deep, soft snow.
Vail is a young resort, which sometimes prompts its biggest rival, Aspen, to
poke fun at it.
Recently - with stagnation creeping into the American skiing industry - the
two areas have developed a tentative alliance and are marketed as
twin-centre resorts.
Vail was built in the early 1960s in the image of a Tyrolean/Bavarian
hybrid.
The resort has a cosmopolitan atmosphere and varied cuisine. The skiing is a
cruisers' delight, with more than two thirds of the 110 runs graded beginner
or intermediate.
The Summit County resorts of Breckenridge, Keystone, Arapahoe Basin and
Copper Mountain are all within 30 or 40 miles.
CANADA
APEX
Apex Resort, 5,200ft up in British Columbia's Okanagan Valley near
Penticton, will be almost unrecognisable this winter: more than Dollars 10m
has been spent on improving the ski area, developing its Wild West theme
(the Gunbarrel saloon's speciality is coffee made with brandy and Cointreau
flambeed into the glass down the double-barrel of a shotgun).
The new Holiday Inn 'Sun Spree' resort hotel at Apex Mountain village will
provide 89 rooms, and a new high-speed detachable quad to the summit -
'Quickdraw' - replaces two old chairs, cutting travelling time to less than
six minutes.
There are seven new trails, with names like Outlaw and Maverick, and a
summer-grooming programme (removing rocks, widening trails, etc) has been
carried out on existing trails like Gunbarrel, Magnum 22, Buckshot and
flanks. Make My Day - a chute whose name was inspired by Clint Eastwood
movies - will also be a smoother ski, but just as challenging.
A new snowmaking system has also been installed. Apex now has 52 trails on
its two mountain faces (Apex and Beaconsfield peaks) almost half of them
intermediate grade, with 10 per cent novice standard and about a third of
them in the advanced/expert category. With skiing up to about 7,200ft, the
vertical drop is 2,000ft.
BANFF/LAKE LOUISE
Technically Banff/Lake Louise comprises three different ski areas (Mount
Norquay/Mystic Ridge, Sunshine Village and Lake Louise itself) but as they
are up to 30 miles apart, it seems arbitrary to try to 'link' them.
Lake Louise is the showpiece, in terms of skiing (four mountain faces on
Mounts Whitehorn and Lipalian, five bowls and more than 3,250 vertical foot
drop) and outstanding scenery - there are more than a dozen peaks that reach
10,000ft or more.
Each chair has an easy way down for novice skiers. Sunshine Village, which
straddles the Continental Divide and the Alberta/British Columbia border, is
a high altitude resort with good intermediate slopes above the tree-line. It
can be bleak and cold in bad weather, but if you catch it on a good day, the
scenery including Canada's 'Matterhorn' (Mount Assiniboine) is dramatic.
Mount Norquay, now mystified with the prefix 'Mystic Ridge', is Banff's
local ski area, and probably the oldest resort in Canada. Small but steep, a
whole new upper-intermediate area with 12 new runs was recently opened up on
'Mystic Ridge'.
But Norquay is still best known for a run called Lone Pine, described in The
Insider's Guide to the Best Canadian Skiing as 'an unforgiving brute
legendary for its unrelenting vertical and monster moguls'.
Banff/Lake Louise is celebrated for its railway hotels built for Canadian
Pacific passengers. The Banff Springs is perched above the town, while
Chateau Lake Louise is in the most stunning lake-side location with views of
five glaciers.
BIG WHITE
With a base elevation of 5,450ft, Big White, in the heart of the Monashees,
is the highest ski resort in British Columbia. The terrain is unusually
varied, with steep gulleys and bowls (the recently opened Parachute Bowl was
the location for the Canadian Speed Skiing Championships three years ago)
and there are good cruising runs like Roller Coaster, Speculation and
Villager as well as tree skiing in Paradise Glades.
The 1,000 skiable acres are divided between groomed slopes and bowls and
glades. At higher elevations, snow on the trees often freezes, turning them
into the so-called 'snow-ghosts' that are the hallmark of Canada's higher
resorts. The Ridge Rocket Quad, which almost bisects the resort, is the main
artery to much of the skiing. The terrain between the Rocket and Big White's
other main quad, Bullet, is almost entirely lower intermediate and
intermediate. The main expert terrain can be found off the Powder and Falcon
chairs, at present on the outer perimeter of the ski area, although the
resort has expansion plans.
PANORAMA
Panorama, which emerged as a significant ski area a decade or so ago, is now
famous for three things: helicopter skiing, day trippers, and vertical feet.
Recently the resort built a new lift (the Summit T-bar) up to its Top of the
World area, giving it 4,300 vertical feet - more than Jackson Hole, Wyoming,
the US's biggest vertical drop. All this, including 43 trails, is
accomplished with only eight lifts.
Panorama is long and lean; its vertical drop is achieved by having one chief
spine-like ridge (served on one flank by the Quadzilla chair and on the
other by the Sunbird triple chair) but few ribs.
Although it is situated on the edge of the Bugaboos in the Purcell Mountains
 -ranges well-known to helicopter skiers - Panorama relies on its
snow-making system to keep its runs well-covered. Almost three quarters of
its terrain is topped up with artificial snow, which makes many of the
trails a little unforgiving, though good for strong intermediates and above
who enjoy high-speed cruising.
Panorama also provides the setting for helicopter skiing outings with RK
Heliski, mainly from Banff, two hours away, and specialises in newcomers
requiring 'easy pace' descents.
RED MOUNTAIN
If Canada has a low-profile cult resort legendary among the cognoscenti for
being steep and deep, Red Mountain is it. Yet it has only four lifts serving
the 30 trails on its two peaks. (Red Mountain is the original, easier
mountain, and Granite, with a vertical drop of 2,800ft is by far the
bigger.)
Statistics tell you much about the resort's profile. Snowmaking: none
(hardly ever needed). Expert terrain: 45 per cent. The Kootenay region
between the US border and Revelstoke is home to three of the world's most
famous helicopter skiing ranges: the Monashees, Purcells, and Selkirks.
Skiing was introduced to the area a century ago by Norwegian gold miners in
nearby Rossland, one of British Columbia's few genuine old mining towns
turned ski resorts.
The first ski competitions were held here before the turn of the century.
These racers' pioneering efforts led to the Winter Olympic triumphs of Nancy
Greene (1968) and Kerin Lee-Gartner (1992), two of Rossland's most famous
ski racers. Apart from Red's many powder options, it has one of the best
cruising trails in North America: Long Squaw.
SILVER STAR
Silver Star ski area, in the Okanagan Valley on the edge of the famous
Monashee Mountains, changed itself from a friendly (really friendly: lift
attendants sometimes hug skiers) 'ma and pa' ski hill, to a destination
resort by developing the terrain it most lacked: 23 trails for advanced
intermediates and experts at Putnam Creek Basin.
That also doubled its size, making it the second largest ski area in British
Columbia (after Whistler/Blackcomb) and increased its vertical drop to
2,500ft, the biggest in the Okanagan (famous for its wines).
Putnam Creek and the original slopes at Vance Creek are linked by a long
quad chair which enables skiers either to make continuous loops back into
Putnam Creek or to return to base. Silver Star, with its brightly coloured
imitation l890s architecture from the 'Victorian gaslight era' is one of the
most attractive resorts in Canada.
Many trail names reflect the area's mining history or echo its name: Lone
Star, Milky Way, Constellation and Big Dipper are all easy cruising runs in
Vance Creek.
WHISTLER/BLACKCOMB
For many skiers these two towering mountains that stand shoulder to shoulder
near the western seaboard of British Columbia provide the best skiing in
North America.
They have the biggest vertical drop, with more than 5,000ft of skiing on
both mountains, a full 1,000ft more than Jackson Hole, the highest in the
US.
Yet 30 years and some Dollars 600m ago there was nothing here except the
mountains. Until then, the munificent snow caused by the moist Pacific air
meeting the craggy mountain-tops fell silently and was skied only by the few
prepared to hike up. Now Whistler's bowls and Blackcomb's glaciers - and the
huge network of other trails in between (almost 200 in all) - are served by
24 lifts. One of Whistler's problems is the weather that produces so much
good snow: in spite of its big vertical drop, the height of Whistler Village
(purpose-built and car-free) is only 2,140ft (almost 500ft lower than
Kitzbuhel, one of the lowest important resorts in Europe).
That means it is often raining down in the village while it is snowing on
the slopes. Rain is an off-putting sight to skiers weighing up whether to
venture out on the slopes or not. In Whistler, it is nearly always worth
giving the weather the benefit of the doubt.
S AMERICA
CHAPELCO (Argentina)
Chapelco is an intermediate ski area that has sprouted horns. It started
life in 1978, but like Gran Catedral, Bariloche, its more famous neighbour
75 miles to the south, it could not guarantee good snow.
Skiers from Buenos Aires who once knew Chapelco for its gentle, tree-lined
runs are now confused by Chapelco's more machismo image. They complain that
while money is poured into the thrilling terrain on the upper slopes, they
lack good snow below the tree-line at 5,000ft. The situation is aggravated
by the fact that Chapelco's slopes face north (the 'wrong' way for a
southern hemisphere resort). Chapelco is a substantial ski area: it has 10
lifts and 35 runs.
EL COLORADO (Chile)
With 16 lifts and 25 trails, El Colorado is Chile's biggest and arguably
most popular ski area, at least at weekends, when day trippers flock here
from Santiago, the capital which - pollution allowing - is at times visible
in the valley below.
El Colorado's cone-shaped peak, with south-facing slopes, has good cruising
with excellent off-piste below the cliffs on the south-eastern edge of the
resort. A guide is advisable and a pick-up vehicle essential.
GRAN CATEDRAL, BARILOCHE (Argentina)
There is much to like about this cosmopolitan resort on the banks of Lake
Nahuel Huapi: but two things let it down. It has an unpredictable snow
record, for which it can hardly be blamed, and it is not well organised.
Indifferent organisation is often the fate of ski resorts which have lifts
run by different companies. Bariloche is no exception.
One manifestation is poor piste marking. In fresh snow, it is hard to tell
poles indicating rocks from those marking the way down. That is a serious
problem in a resort with 32 lifts, 50 trails, and a vertical drop of
3,280ft.
Heini Kempel, director of the Gran Catedral ski school and formerly of
Argentina's demonstration ski team, believes one day soon Bariloche - with
its excellent cruising runs on the upper slopes, its chutes and bowls below
Punta Nevada, and the Carlitos and La Hoya mogul runs - will live up to its
reputation as South America's best ski resort.
LA PARVA (Chile)
La Parva may have the edge over Portillo as the best single ski area in
Chile. Portillo has more dramatic terrain and scenery, but La Parva has more
choice.
It has the biggest vertical drop: 3,150ft. Such is the variety of skiing
options and scenery that days on the mountain rush by.
The problem with La Parva is that it is more a glorified ski club village
than a resort. It has no big hotel. La Parva has 13 lifts, most of them
going to interesting places, especially the new Barros Hegros chair,
reputedly the longest quad in South America.
There are 20 listed runs, but much off-piste skiing opens up after a good
snowfall.
LAS LENAS (Argentina)
While Bariloche would like to think it has the most important skiing in
Argentina, that honour probably belongs to Las Lenas.
No other resort in South America has such an extraordinary choice of chutes,
gulleys and other off-piste delights.
Las Lenas has an unusual history: almost 20 years ago the then owners of the
land (two brothers who ran a food and manufacturing company) were kidnapped
by guerrillas who demanded a ransom of USDollars 60m. Released unharmed, the
brothers sold to the present owners, who opened the resort in 1983.
Many of lifts and hotels have astrological themes: Piscis is the best hotel,
Geminis the smallest. Venus is a beginner chair, and Neptune accesses the
most exciting and important lift in the resort, Marte (Mars).
PORTILLO (Chile)
Owned by the American Purcell brothers, this is probably the best-run ski
resort in the continent and among the most spectacular, in a steep sided
valley.
It has introduced snow-making on a realistic level, its pistes are
well-groomed and signposted, and it has expert avalanche control. The resort
is dominated by the colonial-style Hotel Portillo, the emphasis on
old-fashioned style, comfort, and values.
The skiing is exotic and slightly eccentric. It is possible to ski to the
lake, and to be rowed back or to ski back on the ice. The steep avalanche
chutes are a big attraction: two are served by unique Va et Vient lifts.
These have no lift towers, but drag skiers up on high-speed platters
suspended in mid-air.
The run kept open at almost all costs is the mile-long plateau run; a
perfect pitch for most skiers, a classic cruising run with no awkward
moments.
TERMAS DE CHILLAN (Chile)
There are several volcano ski areas in Chile's Lake District: most have
exciting scenery but their skiing is compromised, either by wet or windy
conditions.
Termas de Chillan is perhaps the only one that manages to maintain
reasonably good skiing conditions. The resort is 51 miles from Chillan, the
birthplace of Bernardo O'Higgins, Chile's great revolutionary hero and first
president.
Its Don Otto chairlift, at 1 1/2 miles, is the longest in South America.
From the top, skiers have a choice of some exquisite off-piste gulleys and
ravines.
VALLE NEVADO (Chile)
Valle Nevado is pure deja vu: a French purpose-built ski area rising
straight out of the Andes below the awe-inspiring peak of El Plomo
(17,815ft). It was built and is owned by Spie Batignolles, one of France's
biggest construction companies.
Valle Nevado was completed in 1988 in the image of what international skiers
might expect from a modern European resort.
AUSTRALASIA
CORONET PEAK (NZ)
Queenstown's old ski area is across the Wakatipu Valley from the town's more
recent resort, The Remarkables, and commands superb views of both the
mountains and Lake Wakatipu.
Snow-making has been extended and Coronet Peak now claims the most trails
(10km) with snow cannon in New Zealand.
Beginners have not been forgotten; there is a new novice area, Peak Meadows.
Coronet Peak's trails provide a good mix for novices and intermediates, with
a wealth of blue cruising trails like M1, Wall Street, Greengates and
Shirtfront. In good powder, the runs to try are the Back Bowls and Sara Sue.
MOUNT BULLER (Aus)
Mount Buller is located in Victoria's High Country, three hours drive from
Melbourne. It is Australia's biggest resort in terms of lifts and now it
wants to build more on Mount Stirling, a cross country resort across the
valley. The locals are indignant about Buller's plans to build lifts.
The trails at Buller command some of the most breathtaking scenery of any
ski area in Australia.
MOUNT COOK (NZ)
Not a ski resort as such (although skiing in South Island started here in
the early 1920s) but the setting for flights by ski-plane to the
outstandingly beautiful Tasman Glacier.
Skiers are transported 11 miles or so from an air strip near Mount Cook
Village by Swiss Pilatus ski-planes which land at the top of the glacier.
MOUNT HUTT (NZ)
Rising high above the Canterbury Plains, 90 minutes from Christchurch, Mount
Hutt is one of the first ski areas in the southern hemisphere to open, with
skiing from May to October.
Severe storms can sometimes close the resort or make the long, precarious
road (the highest in New Zealand) too dangerous to negotiate, hence its
nickname of Mount Shut. But snow conditions are often excellent, with good
powder.
Mount Hutt has snow making facilities covering 100 acres.
Beginner and intermediate trails such as Broadway and Morning Glory dominate
the central section of the ski area, with most of the challenging black runs
on both perimeters.
With a vertical drop of 2,150ft (one of the biggest in Australasia), Mount
Hutt has 900 acres of skiing served by 10 lifts. Helicopter skiing is also
available.
PERISHER/SMIGGINS (Australia)
As you would expect from a ski area owned by Kerry Packer and run by his son
James, Perisher markets itself aggressively. It needs to. The enemy is on
both sides: Thredbo to the South, Blue Cow to the North.
Perisher makes great play of having more than twice as many slopes above
5,400ft than any other Australian resort.
Perisher Valley itself is flat, yet there is seriously steep skiing below
Olympic Steppes (sometimes producing formidable deep-snow skiing, but more
often great moguls) and some of the runs off Mount Perisher are challenging.
THE REMARKABLES (NZ)
When you first gaze up at the jagged, snow-encrusted teeth of The
Remarkables, which dominate the Queenstown skyline, you cannot work out
where there could possibly be any skiing.
But The Remarkables offers good beginner and intermediate terrain in a large
bowl scooped out on the benign side of the pinnacles. There is challenging
skiing, although there are only three lifts (apart from beginners' tows):
from the Shadow Basin chair at least 10 black runs can be reached.
THREDBO (Australia)
Thredbo has spent almost Pounds 30m on improvements in the last seven years
(including a new express quad chair, The Cruiser) and this has probably
turned it into Australia's best ski resort.
At the foot of Mount Crackenback and less than four miles from Australia's
highest peak, Mount Kosciusko, Thredbo has the most attractive village, the
biggest vertical drop (9ft short of New Zealand's highest at Whakapapa) and
a snow-making system claimed to be the largest in the southern hemisphere.
Thredbo also claims the longest run in the country, the Village Trail (3.5
miles).
TREBLE CONE (NZ)
Some of the steepest in-resort slopes in New Zealand can be found at Treble
Cone, beneath the flanks of New Zealand's Southern Alps.
Strong skiers are attracted to the area, and will often walk the last 800ft
to the summit to achieve fresh tracks in powder and a bonus to the 2,000
vertical feet the lifts offer. Recently the resort has been trying to
encourage family skiers too.
Treble Cone is well-known for its population of Keas, New Zealand's
mischievous Alpine parrot.
TUROA (NZ)
New Zealand's second biggest ski area is on the same volcano as the biggest
(Whakapapa). But Turoa's terrain is very different. Its main attraction is a
series of long, undulating gulleys which can provide skiers with fine
off-piste cruising.
Turoa was conceived as recently as the 1970s as an overspill resort for
Whakapapa. It is possible to traverse between the two resorts, but a
complete link is unlikely because of environmental pressures.
WHAKAPAPA (NZ)
Even down-under, skiers are only beginning to be alerted to the qualities of
this excellent resort.
Whakapapa, probably New Zealand's oldest skiing centre, combines
awe-inspiring terrain and scenery. It is built on the flanks of Mount
Ruapehu, one of three dramatic volcanoes that rise from nowhere in the
middle of North Island.
From the Whakapapa side, a series of half a dozen individual peaks dominate
the skyline. Between these peaks are a number of gulleys which can be
negotiated by advanced skiers prepared to hike up to reach them. Below the
gulleys is more extreme terrain which can be reached from the Valley T-bar
lift.
JAPAN
HAPPO ONE
The Hakuba Valley is probably the best skiing region in Japan, and Happo One
is the jewel among its five resorts - seven if you count the tiny areas of
Hakuba Minekata and Hakuba Highland across the valley.
With a backdrop of serious peaks reaching almost 10,000ft, Happo One will
stage the blue riband event of the 1998 Olympics: the men's downhill. It
will also be staging the men's Super-G and ski jumping. (Shiga Kogen will
host most of the remaining events.)
Happo has 35 lifts and the prettiest resort village - a slightly Walt
Disneyish collection of crenellated, mock Tudor buildings through which
winds an attractive narrow street lined with shops and restaurants.
The Hokuba Valley is one of the longer train journeys from Tokyo (3hr 25min
by limited express, with an awkward platform change at Matsumoto) but well
worth the effort.
NAEBA
Naeba, in Niigata prefecture is Japan's ultimate ski 'factory' and because
of the huge numbers of skiers sometimes found on the mountain (41,000 was
the record one Sunday a few years ago) it would not be the ideal
introduction to Japanese skiing for tourists.
It is extremely popular with Tokyo businessmen because it is relatively
close to Tokyo and there are lifts open from 4.30am until 11pm.
There are plenty of hotels in the area, yet some skiers sleep on the benches
in the locker rooms for a few hours and then set off to ski at 4.30am.
Naeba has 31 lifts, a substantial number of trails - mainly beginner and
intermediate - and there are some good powder options.
NOZAWA ONSEN
Buses packed with skiers leave Tokyo before dawn for the long journey to
this attractive ski area in the northern part of Nagano prefecture.
Nozawa Onsen combines a delightfully traditional ski village with good
skiing and - as the word Onsen denotes - hot springs.
It has 32 lifts and a good variety of terrain: in the right conditions there
is good powder skiing at the top of the area (reached by a five minute
gondola ride) and some attractive tree-lined beginner slopes lower down.
There is also night skiing available.
SHIGA KOGEN
Shiga Kogen, which will co-host the 1998 Nagano winter Olympics with Happo
One, is a microcosm of Japanese skiing. It is an extraordinary patchwork
quilt of small ski areas - 22 in all, sharing 75 lifts - which, rather like
a Japanese version of the Portes du Soleil, can be visited on skis in a day
or two at the most. But do not expect too much in the way of challenging
skiing.
Shiga Kogen is reached from Tokyo (Ueno station) by limited express on the
Shin-etsu line to Nagano (just under three hours) followed by another train
journey of 45 minutes to Yudanaka and a bus ride.
ZAO
The mountains of Japan's central highlands and the Japan Alps are numerous,
and if you include the more remote and less crowded slopes of Hokkaido,
Japan has an estimated 600 ski 'areas' (many very small, mostly medium
sized) of which perhaps only 20 have an international flavour.
Of these Zao, in the north-east of Honshu in Yamagata prefecture - a
three-hour journey from Tokyo, followed by a 45-minute bus drive - is
recognised as one of the best.
As well as an astonishing number of lifts for a Japanese resort (42), Zao
has all the prerequisites that western skiers imagine they will find in the
Japan Alps: hot springs, night skiing and juhyo (tree monsters)] These are
not demons that live in the trees, but the trees themselves that become so
thickly coated with ice and snow that they form surreal, ghostly shapes.
Forty per cent of the slopes are considered easy skiing, with just 20 per
cent designated expert terrain.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Property: Country life - in town - Winter can sour that
romantic rural idyll. Gerald Cadogan has an alternative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When winter comes, romantics living in the English countryside often find
that life in a picturesque village or down a long lane has severe drawbacks.
You can be blocked in by snow for days at a time. And you must drive
substantial distances to reach the services you need, from doing the
shopping to visiting a library or the doctor. Drivers can clock up 20,000
miles a year like this - often in treacherous conditions.
Thus, those experienced in country ways tend to reject homes in remote areas
in favour of old market towns where all the advantages of country life exist
and a substantial house is often cheaper than a village rectory or farmhouse
of the same size. Mud-free and comfortable, these properties are just too
sensible to be ignored - as older people, in particular, appreciate. But the
Barbour and wellie brigade, looking for the 'real' country, has virtually
ignored them. The prices tend to reflect it.
Many of them date from the 18th century when England settled down after the
civil and religious strife of the 17th century. As prosperity spread, the
middle classes built homes to show their improved position. Sometimes, this
involved adding a box-like, large-windowed Georgian facade to a Tudor or
medieval gabled house. Such places have a comfortable, reassuring feel.
Here, then, is a selection of good country-town houses. Generally, they are
Georgian, with walled gardens of manageable size.
WALES: Cantre Selyf is a substantial Georgian house in the centre of Brecon
with a walled garden big enough to keep all the family busy when not walking
in the Beacons. Its asking figure looks particularly attractive compared
with similar houses in England. Price: Pounds 200,000. Agent: Knight Frank &amp;
Rutley.
SUFFOLK: Bury St Edmunds is a cathedral town with wide streets (and the
Georgian Theatre Royal) in the East Anglian region. No 17 Westgate Street is
large, Georgian and built of red brick, with a separate access from Friars
Lane. Price: Pounds 395,000. Agent: Bedford.
COTSWOLDS: You do not expect houses to be cheap in Chipping Campden,
especially if they are two knocked into one with a total of eight bedrooms
and Corinthian pilasters on the front. Bedfont &amp; Woodward House reflects the
wealth of the wool merchants who built it 250 years ago. Price: around
Pounds 950,000. Agents: KFR, James Martindale or Savills.
EAST SUSSEX: Lewes is among my favourite towns, with its smart houses on the
high ground along the High Street, dominated by the castle. Down below,
Southover used to be a separate village before being absorbed into the main
town.
Southover Cottage, in Southover High Street is a good example of the
traditional Sussex style of building, which involves a cladding of hanging
tiles on the upper floor, Yet, it was put up as recently as 1920. Price:
Pounds 225,000. Agent: Humberts.
In the same street, The Gables was the main Tory coffee house in 1800, a
time when Lewes returned two MPs to Westminster. Price: Pounds 375,000.
Agents: Rowland Gorringe or Humberts.
HAMPSHIRE: Lymington is famous as a centre for sailing. No 5 Quay Hill is a
bow-fronted town house facing on to a cobbled pedestrian street. Price:
Pounds 190,000. Agent: John D. Wood.
The same agent is also selling 24 Church Lane, an end-of-terrace, grade II
cottage. This still has an outside lavatory - besides, of course, the one in
the house. Price: Pounds 90,000.
In the large village of Wickham, near Southampton, two stately 18th century
houses on The Square, both in blue brick with red-brick trim, are for sale.
Wickham House (Pounds 410,000) is offered by Lane Fox while Havelock House
(Pounds 275,000) is on the books of John D. Wood.
LEICESTERSHIRE: Oakham is the county town of what used to be Rutland and has
a public school, a market twice a week and a splendid, 12th century castle.
Yule House is a classic example of a town house that began as a cottage.
Then, an imposing Queen Anne front was added and, eventually, a Victorian
bay.
Probably the best house in town, it was for a long time the lodgings for the
visiting judge who conducted the local assizes. Today, it is listed grade
II*. Price: Pounds 375,000 (down from Pounds 395,000).
DEVON: White Hart House in Okehampton is a medieval property with much of
its original architecture surviving. Indeed, it was once a pub, as the name
suggests. Now, it has plenty of bedrooms, an adjoining listed barn and views
of Dartmoor from the overgrown garden. Price: Pounds 135,000. Agent:
Millerson.
HERTFORDSHIRE: At Sawbridgeworth, a bijou white house by the old bowling
green and the church is for sale. Trevarthen is basically late-17th century,
but it was improved with a Georgian Gothic front early in the 1800s. Price:
Pounds 325,000. Agent: Mullucks Wells.
DORSET: Sherborne is a delightful town noted for its abbey, castle and
schools. The Red House in Long Street, listed grade II*, is a red-brick gem
with a stone trim and dates to around 1700. It is among the best houses in
town. Price: Pounds 485,000. Agents: Humberts or Michael de Pelet.
The same agents offer St George's which, not surprisingly, is Georgian and
on the edge of the town with a small paddock behind the garden. Price:
Pounds 265,000.
LINCOLNSHIRE: Spalding, Britain's home of bulbs, straddles the river
Welland. No 8 Welland Place, yet another Georgian house, is on the south
side. The asking figure looks especially attractive. Price: Pounds 98,500.
Agent: Carter Jonas.
NORTH YORKSHIRE: In York, a late-18th century brick house is on the market.
It has a bowed back wing added about 1830, and a studio in the walled
garden. No 8 Clifton is just five minutes' walk from the centre of town and
the minster. Price: offers over Pounds 295,000. Agent: Jackson-Stops.
Nearby is 22 Clifton Green, a superior cottage dating to 1839 at the start
of the Victorian Gothic style. Price: Pounds 210,000. Agent: Carter Jonas.
Jackson-Stops also offers 127 The Mount, a Regency villa that is slightly
further out but close to the racecourse. Price: Pounds 325,000.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Cast in a survivor's mould - A
look at a company which has weathered several storms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It could not be more different from the exclusive galleries of Bond Street
or St James's, or the hushed rooms of an art gallery.
Pangolin Editions' main foundry, at Chalford, near Stroud, Gloucestershire,
is a cacophony of sound: 9,000 sq ft of hangar-like building, in which
members of the 29-strong team are sawing, grinding, hammering and performing
the myriad operations involved in working bronze.
Casting bronzes for Britain's estimated 2,000 full-time and part-time
sculptors is complicated. It involves mould-making, wax-making, firing,
pouring, fettling and chasing - all processes that have to be performed in
several stages.
The labour-intensive nature of the business is one of the main reasons why
three of the handful of British companies in the field went out of business
last year.
'At one stage we thought we would be joining them,' said managing director
Rungwe Kingdon, who founded Pangolin 9 1/2 years ago.
Kingdon, 34, and his wife, Claude, run a business with a turnover of Pounds
650,000 but which makes little money.
'If I wanted to be a rich man I would not be in this business,' said
Kingdon, who can remember first wanting to cast bronze at the age of eight.
As a teenager he was influenced by his father, writer and sculptor Jonathon
Kingdon.
When the family returned to this country from Uganda - his father had been
professor of fine art at Makerere University and gave his son the name of an
African volcano - Kingdon went to art college before joining sculptor Lynn
Chadwick, a lifelong influence, to learn the business.
After four years he set up his first foundry in his father's backyard in a
village near Oxford. 'By then I had decided that I did not want to be a
second-class sculptor, but, as I had always suspected, to concentrate on
bronze casting,' said Kingdon.
His great interest then, as it still is, was on patination - the creation of
different finishes, usually by chemical means, on the surface of the
finished casting.
After three years in Oxfordshire he bought a 2,000 sq ft section of a former
asbestos works on an industrial estate at Chalford and soon became the head
of a 10-strong bronze casting team. The building cost Pounds 25,000, of
which Pounds 15,000 was on a mortgage. 'It was a bargain. Twelve months
later, in 1989, it was worth Pounds 125,000,' said Kingdon.
The business built up quickly. Within two years Kingdon had nearly 200
sculptors as clients and a workforce of 27. To cast monument-size bronzes he
rented an adjoining 9,000 sq ft unit, complete with overhead gantry, and
looked forward to expanding an already promising order book. The bank was
happy to lend him Pounds 100,000 to purchase equipment and to service the
company's Pounds 30,000 overdraft.
For Pangolin, Kingdon can date the arrival of the recession precisely. 'It
was in the first few weeks of 1990. The orders just came to a halt,' he
said.
'The international art market went flat. Within a few months the value of
the building we owned had dropped to Pounds 50,000 and our overdraft was
running at Pounds 75,000. Our debts were not covered, and the bank knew it.'
Kingdon was forced to make five people redundant. The rest of the workforce
agreed to defer overtime payments, and sections of the newly-acquired main
foundry building were under-used. A dispute with two employees led to an
industrial tribunal - and a Pounds 5,500 payout he could not afford, and
more headaches.
For Kingdon it was the worst of four crises in as many years. The other
three have centred on cash flow. 'Last year we turned over Pounds 650,000
and made virtually no profit,' Kingdon said. 'This year looks like being a
little better - but I am still gradually repaying my staff for overtime
worked several years ago.'
Nevertheless, the business is surviving, while competitors have gone out of
business. 'Pangolin is now one of four large bronze-casting foundries left
in the UK and in terms of staff numbers and capacity probably the largest,'
Kingdon said. 'Really there are too many people working here for the
business to be really profitable. But our speciality is patinas -
hand-finishing of bronze, which creates subtle hues of greens, browns, greys
and blues, as well as black and white.
If a sculptor is seeking a certain patina and wants a foundry that
specialises in surface changes to the finished casting than he is likely to
be more dependent on us than on others.'
Pangolin has the capacity to cast large pieces. Last year three full-size
bronze elephants, each weighing four tonnes, were cast. Other undertakings
have included a full-size bronze of Captain Cook, which is to go to New
Zealand.
This summer the foundry undertook its biggest job yet - an abstract bronze
sculpture in three parts weighing a total of 15 tonnes. In early September
it was unveiled in Brussels as the centrepiece of the city's liberation
celebrations.
Kingdon attributes the expanding order book to the fact that the company is
now known in the art world as a survivor, and to the training programme run
by his artist wife that has helped improve quality and provided an
experienced, stable workforce.
'We have also been regularly going to exhibitions and art fairs and this has
helped bring in work from overseas. In the last 12 months we have probably
done work for sculptors in a dozen countries,' he said.
Gallery Pangolin has contributed to the company's survival. Under the same
roof there is a permanent display of pieces loaned by leading sculptors.
Opening is by appointment. Currently, a six-week exhibition is running and
nearly all the pieces are for sale.
'The gallery is a sideline. Any money it produces goes into another
catalogue and into our art fair fund,' Kingdon said. 'However it serves a
useful function in promoting the work of our client sculptors and in showing
what we are capable of.'
Another reason for cautious optimism is the increasing volume of work the
company is asked to do for archaeological teams and for research institutes.
This usually involves testing theories on how historic artefacts were
originally produced and finished.
'What the company really needs is money to buy some new equipment and
improve our casting techniques,' Kingdon said. 'That would really put this
place on the map.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Nature of Things: Catching scientists for life - Using
technology to inspire children is the aim of two initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask a scientist approaching the end of his career how he first became
interested in science, and he is likely to reminisce about some wonderful
teacher who gripped his imagination during physics, chemistry or biology
lessons.
Mixed with the nostalgia will be a lament for the alleged decline in science
teaching, which means that few of today's schoolchildren are inspired in the
same way.
Many people involved in science education share the idea that enthusing a
child at the right age will produce a scientist for life - and some concede
that fewer inspiring teachers are at work today than 50 years ago.
Hence the current wave of programmes to use resources outside the classroom,
such as museums and the media, to put across the excitement of science.
Two good examples of this sort of child-grabbing initiative have just been
announced.
One comes from London's venerable Science Museum, the first in the world to
open a children's gallery in the 1930s. The museum is to invest Pounds 4m
(half from its own funds and half from sponsors) in new facilities for
youngsters from toddlers to teenagers, known collectively as Project 95.
The other is Voyage VI in the international Jason Project, which will use
'interactive television' to take about 400,000 schoolchildren on a
scientific expedition to the mid-Pacific island of Hawaii next year.
Their experiences will range from guiding a remotely operated vehicle into
the mouth of a live volcano, to viewing the other planets through Hawaii's
mountaintop observatories.
Jason is funded by corporate sponsors and organised by Bob Ballard, the
famous American oceanographer whose accomplishments include finding the
wreck of the Titanic. Barclays Life is spending Pounds 600,000 over three
years bringing Jason to Britain under the management of National Museums and
Galleries on Merseyside.
What the two projects have in common is lavish use of high-tech
communications equipment. Jason will connect pupils, parents and teachers at
30 'interactive network sites' in the US, UK and Canada with the scientists
in Hawaii, via live satellite links.
Sixty different programmes will be broadcast during the two-week project, so
that as many participants as possible can take a turn at talking to the
scientists or operating the cameras by remote control.
Network 95, the communications system at the heart of the Science Museum's
project, will not operate across continents but just within the museum in
South Kensington. It will, however, offer young visitors what Roger
Bridgman, curator of communications, says is the world's first multimedia
video-conferencing system designed for casual public use.
Children coming into the museum will be given a supermarket-style barcode
sticker on the back of the hand, to identify them as they log on at one of
the eight terminals.
The system will then issue an identifying nickname, such as Nimpy or Monkey,
Ziggy or Bounce (real names will not be used, to protect young users'
privacy from prying adults).
Once logged on, children can communicate by video and sound with friends or
strangers on other terminals. Or they can play games. The system will offer
collaborative activities - for example everyone joining to create a combined
work of computer art - and competitive games such as racing through a maze.
Simulated violence is banned.
Indeed the whole network is designed to appeal more to girls than to boys
reared on violent computer games. For example, the graphics welcoming new
users will feature a series of soft girl-friendly rooms.
Even so, Bridgman fears that some boys will become 'terminal hogs' whom
museum staff will have to ease off the system.
In addition to Network 95 (sponsored by Mercury Communications) the museum
is building six new areas dedicated to involving young people in science.
Gillian Thomas, director of Project 95, is known for her innovative
children's spaces at La Villette Science City outside Paris; she is bringing
in some unexpected young designers, including Ben Kelly who made his name
with the Hacienda night-club in Manchester.
The Science Museum's teen-oriented Communications Cafe, with its multiscreen
displays, video and computer links, could become one of the hippest pick-up
joints - if that's not too old-fashioned a phrase - in late 1990s London.
That would be a wonderful antidote to what Ballard says is 'the common image
of the scientist as a 'nerd', a socially undeveloped individual'.
If Jason and the Science Museum succeed in turning children on to science,
whether through the excitement of steering a buggy into a volcanic cauldron
or making friends at Communications Cafe, that will just be the beginning of
the story.
The schools then have to build on the converts' new enthusiasm and feed them
through a poorly-designed educational pipeline without turning them off
science once again.
To help link Jason with school work, the project provides study materials
which teachers can use in class to relate the Hawaiian expedition to
subjects such as geology and astronomy. (Although these materials originate
in the US, they are being anglicised to fit into the UK national
curriculum.)
In the end, successful science education still depends on direct personal
contact with good teachers. High-tech projects such as Jason and Network 95
provide a welcome spark of interest but they are no substitute for
government action to bring more talented science graduates into the teaching
profession.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Yields stay high - Pibs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Following the successful merger of the Northern Rock building society, the
UK's 11th largest, and the North of England, its smaller neighbour, Pibs
(permanent interest-bearing shares) issued by North of England are now in
Northern Rock's name, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu.
The table shows that gross yields at present are between 10.36 and 11.81 per
cent - higher than a year ago when they stood at 8.62 to 10.22 per cent.
Peter Capel, director of Hoare Govett Corporate Finance, says: 'Sentiment in
the gilt market has improved markedly since the start of the new quarter.
Indeed, this week's retail price inflation data is reducing investors' worst
interest-rate expectations.
'Investment flows have been increasing as investors move to lock-in the
excellent real returns now offered by sterling bond markets. Fixed-rate Pibs
have not as yet felt the full benefit of this change in sentiment, and
currently offer an improved buying opportunity when compared with gilts.'
But the yields on Pibs are also an indication of the higher risk of buying
paper issued by a building society compared with that from the government.
Pibs have no maturity date, so the investor's capital cannot be guaranteed.
The only way to get capital back is to sell the Pibs into the open market.
Interest is paid net of basic-rate tax and gains are exempt from capital
gains tax unless the Pibs are held within a unit trust.
In theory, they pay a fixed rate of interest indefinitely, but missed
interest payments do not mount up for payment at a later date. Those holding
Pibs are last in line for repayment in the event of a wind-up, and are not
covered by a compensation scheme.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Transfer of ownership
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I inherited my house from my husband in 1971 and have lived in it with my
son ever since. In 1985, ownership was converted into a beneficial joint
tenancy between us.
If I were now to make over ownership to him entirely, would any or all of
its value be included in my estate for the purposes of inheritance tax?
The transfer of the interest that gave rise to the joint tenancy with your
son is not a gift with reservation by you provided both of you are using the
property jointly and sharing the outgoings.
Transferring your interest to your son while you continue to live in the
property will not be effective for inheritance tax. Your interest will be
treated as still forming part of your estate. (Reply by Barry Stillerman).

FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Voluntary liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I was a shareholder in a small unquoted company which sold almost all its
assets and went into voluntary liquidation. The liquidator made an interim
payment to me in the tax year ending April 1994, and has indicated a further
final payment will be made in the tax year ending next April.
The interim payment is big enough to make me liable for capital gains tax
after my Pounds 5,800 allowance and indexation.
Am I liable for CGT on the interim payment and also liable to a separate
assessment on the final payment? If so, am I entitled to Pounds 5,800 in
each tax year?
The answer to both your questions is yes. Ask your tax office for a copy of
Inland Revenue Statement of Practice D3 (Company liquidations: tax on
shareholders' capital gains) which was issued on January 20 1972. (If you
have any difficulty, write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Office,
Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 1LB.)
A free booklet of statements of practice (up to last year) is available, if
you are interested: IR131. The free booklet of extra-statutory concessions
(up to last year) is IR1. Both are obtainable from tax offices.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Be ready for questions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
My wife has recently transferred some shares to my name. Although there was
no financial consideration involved, am I correct in assuming that, for CGT
or other purposes, the cost of acquisition would be taken as the share price
at the date of transfer?
Ever since CGT was introduced in 1965, the basic rule for transfers between
spouses (living together) has been that the asset is deemed to go across at
cost, regardless of what price (if any) is actually paid or its value at the
time.
Ask your tax office for the free leaflet CGT15 (Capital gains tax: a guide
for married couples), but bear in mind that it is not up to date.
We are, however, a little concerned at your use of the phrase 'transferred .
. . to my name' rather than 'given me'. A mere transfer into your name is
not in itself sufficient to effect a change of beneficial ownership.
In the absence of evidence of an intention to confer beneficial ownership
upon her husband, English law assumes that a married woman who transfers
shares etc into her husband's name does so with the intention that he should
hold them as her nominee, beneficial ownership remaining with the wife (no
consideration for the transfer having passed from husband to wife).
The Revenue looks closely at transfers between spouses, so you should be
prepared for questions in due course.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Exempt transfers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What time limits apply to gifts qualifying as exempt transfers? In other
words, how long before and after the date of marriage may they be made?
There is no specific time limit relating to gifts in consideration of the
marriage, but the gift must be in consideration of the marriage. So, it must
be made at the time of the marriage or shortly before. Strict proof is
required when a gift made after the marriage is alleged to be in
consideration of it. (Reply by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward).

FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: IHT limit is 'grotesque'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am resident and domiciled in Switzerland and my wife is resident and
domiciled in Italy. We are both in our 70s and, although we have chosen to
live apart, she would normally benefit from my estate if I were to
pre-decease her.
I understand that if I were to resume a domicile in the UK and she remained
in Italy, I would be allowed to leave her only Pounds 55,000 free of
inheritance tax, whereas she could receive any amount available free of
inheritance tax if she were domiciled in the UK.
I believe the figure - which seems grotesque - was set in 1982. Is there any
way of pressing the authorities to review the question?
The purpose of the Pounds 55,000 limit (set by the Finance Act 1982) was,
broadly speaking, to discourage British citizens from marrying foreigners.
The limit is based upon domicile, as distinct from nationality; but, in
fact, the great majority of people who are domiciled in one of the three
constituent countries of the United Kingdom are British citizens and the
great majority of people who are domiciled overseas obviously are not.
Your wife might like to raise the matter with the European Commission on
behalf of nationals of EU states other than the UK.
The European Court has confirmed that discrimination on the basis of
residence can constitute unlawful de facto discrimination between nationals
of one state and another; so it is pretty certain that discrimination on the
basis of domicile (as determined under English, Scots or Northern Ireland
law, as the case may be) constitutes de facto discrimination between
nationals of EU states.
Your wife could write to the Directorate General II, Economic and Financial
Affairs, Financial Integration and Capital Movements, Rue de la Loi 200,
B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Wife has no liability
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Concerning your reply (August 27/28) about charging council tax against the
earnings of a wife required to work at home.
My wife also had to work from home during her job as a salaried employee of
a charity from May 1989 to last month. She used one room exclusively for
this.
During this period, three different methods of local taxation have been in
operation - domestic rates, the community charge and the council tax. Our
house is in my name.
1. Can a proportion of council tax in principle be charged against her
earnings?
2. If so, can she claim retrospectively for 1993/94?
3. Can similar claims be made for domestic rates and community charge for
earlier years?
The answer to all your questions is no. Since the house is exclusively
yours, your wife had no liability either for rates (under the system which
preceded the community charge) or for council tax in respect of the room
which you allowed her to use for her work.
The community charge was a personal tax, not a tax on property, so her
community charge liability had no connection with her work.
The reply published on August 27 was based upon the fact that (so far as we
could deduce from the reader's letter) his wife was joint owner of the
house; thus, she had a council tax liability in her capacity as
tenant-in-common or possibly as joint tenant (it was not clear which type of
joint ownership existed).
The answer to question 3 would have been 'no' in any event, as you will see
from the free pamphlet on owner-occupied houses, CGT4, which is obtainable
from your tax office.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I am operating on the traded options market with money put forward in equal
amounts by myself and three relatives. The account is in my name for ease of
trading and money management. Is there a way we can use up our individual
CGT allowances under this pooled trading system to the satisfaction of the
Inland Revenue?
Presumably you have read the free Private Investor's Guide to the Taxation
of LIFFE Equity Options. If not, ask your broker (or LIFFE's publications
department) for a copy. It was written last January.
Each of the four of you should report a quarter of each transaction in his
or her tax return. You might like to do all the CGT calculations and simply
tell the others what figures to put in their returns.
Doubtless there is adequate documentary evidence of the arrangements between
you, which can be produced to your tax inspector if need be.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I own my house but lodge during the week with my mother because her home is
closer to my place of work. I return home at weekends, holidays etc.
The Inland Revenue says I can nominate my own house as my 'main residence'
for CGT purposes but will not allow me to claim loan interest relief on the
mortgage (Miras) on the ground that I spend more time at my mother's address
than at my own.
Clearly, you are entitled to the benefit of Miras. When your tax inspector
has looked at the judgment in Frost (Inspector of Taxes) v. Feltham, (1981)
STC 115, he will undoubtedly apologise, put Miras into effect forthwith -
and give you the tax relief due for past interest payments.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (9): Where powder stays dry - How technology is
changing the fortunes of artificial slopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN SAMUEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British skiers, Vail decided, were different. So different that Chris Ryman,
the Colorado resort's ski school chief, sent a group of its top instructors
on a tour of British dry ski slopes. 'We wanted to see what made many of our
British visitors tick and maybe learn some things for ourselves,' said
Ryman, now Vail's general manager.
The results were revealing. The main differences between British and US
skiers did not lie in a separate use of the same language but in attitude.
'The British are easygoing, but they want to start at the crack of dawn and
stay till nightfall. No fancy lunches. They want to get on with it and
learn. That's not very American.
'The American spends two days skiing then his wife says, 'Let's go shop in
Denver'. The British will work in a group. They enjoy lessons. They come
back every day and our instructors love it. It's given them a new
incentive,' said Ryman.
He drew a parallel with the British experience of dry slopes and US skiing.
'At Vail there is no wet snow or ice. It's Rocky Mountain powder or packed
powder. It is a controlled environment.' So, of course, is a dry slope.
Lesley Beck, whose slalom 10th in the 1987 world championships at Crans
Montana, Switzerland, is one of the best British performances of recent
times, was reared on brush slopes. 'You learn all the basic skills for snow.
It hurts more when you fall but otherwise it is fabulous preparation. Most
slopes are in or around big towns or cities. It's not strange or
intimidating. It's affordable. Every bit that you are doing counts.'
Plastic-injected spikes or brush nylon, the two main types of artificial
surface, will never take the place of snow, but they can induce good habits
and one in four British skiers will want to limber up on it before their
holiday.
Not all newcomers to dry slopes can expect to be impressed first time out.
Some of the older slopes are as visually appealing as a giant upturned
wheelbarrow. More recent ones are sculpted with bends and bumps.
Twenty per cent of the slopes have 80 per cent of the business and some of
the first-generation facilities are dilapidated. 'The struggling ones are
usually the stand-alones,' said Mike Jardine, British Ski Federation chief
executive.
To survive and thrive a slope needs to be not only interesting but part of a
mixed development with other leisure activities.
'There has to be the right initial investment in anchoring and grading the
slope,' says Jardine. 'Snow generally is soft and yielding and people
initially were worried about the unfriendliness of bristle. Sprained thumbs
were commonplace. Good sprinkler systems came in so these days you sometimes
ski through a fine knee-high mist which comes on at regular intervals. The
lubrication of the slope helps with technique and makes the whole process
more enjoyable.'
A good club core is essential to the success of centres such as Bearsden in
Glasgow, Rossendale on Merseyside, Sheffield, Swadlincote, Telford,
Pontypool, Gloucester, Hillingdon, Bracknell or Chatham. And Southampton has
produced some of Britain's finest aerials skiers.
But Hillend (Edinburgh), at 400m the longest British bristle slope, is
struggling with its costs and companies running Beckton in London Docklands
have twice gone into liquidation.
Will technological advances in indoor snowmaking provide a significant
breakthrough? An L-shaped 150m indoor slope at Tamworth is setting the pace.
It boasts a two-stage escalator and the slope is made of scrapings of snow
laid down like a carpet and methodically regroomed.
'For newcomers and intermediates it is ideal - friendly and a novelty,' said
Jardine. 'It also follows the success formula with a swimming pool,
gymnasium, restaurant and bar.'
Real-snow indoor slopes are a 1990s revolution of almost incalculable
consequences. Malcolm Clulow, managing director of Acer Snowmec, is a
refrigeration expert and convinced non-skier. He has experimented with a 30m
by 10m pilot slope at Telford, and now has plans for six complexes - two
near London, and others at Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and Glasgow.
His winter theme parks will feature beginner, intermediate and expert areas
of differing snow textures, including off-piste, in a controlled -10C
environment where the snow never melts or ices. Skating and white-knuckle
events such as toboganning or bobsleigh are on the agenda. Also hotels,
restaurants, cinemas, bars and shops.
Recently, the South Korean Hyo San Development Company signed a licence to
use Snowmec technology for a series of six centres in Korea, the first a
covered, all-year ski and leisure centre at Migum City, 30 minutes north of
Seoul.
Brian Thomas, director of the Huddersfield-based Briton Engineering, has
been involved in surface and lift construction at Aonach Mor, Britain's
largest outdoor development, and at more than 120 dry slopes.
His hope is that the British ski industry will learn, as it did in the past,
from its climbers. 'Twenty years ago climbing walls were a joke. Now the
proprietary walls keep people coming back and back.
'Similarly, ski surfaces which are not inclined rectangles that you get
bored with in half an hour will give people the incentive to take up skiing
as a sport, not just a holiday pastime.'
But that's not where it ends. To get the best out of a good slope there is
still a need for good instruction. 'Ninety per cent of people will go for a
'safe option',' says Thomas.
'They will not push themselves. They should be guided into uncharted
territory - the steep and deep, the pipe, the ridge, the wall, waves, all
manner of gradients and trainer trails - without excessive risk.'
It sounds something like a financial formula, too.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Several leading providers are reducing their rates while others, which have
been uncompetitive, are putting them up.
One reason for the decrease is that the long-term gilts yield has again
drifted lower, to 8.87 on October 12 after a high of 9.25 on September 20.
Generali, one of the large players, increased its rates by roughly 5.7 per
cent on October 4. But Canada Life, Sun Life of Canada and Prudential cut
theirs this week.
These downward adjustments are the first this year; on average, annuity
rates have risen by 16.5 per cent since January.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Safe options for savers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Guaranteed equity bonds offer two options to savers, writes Gillian
O'Connor. At worst, they will get back a minimum guaranteed sum. The other
is a return linked to the performance of the FT-SE 100 index, which could
exceed the guaranteed minimum substantially if the equity market does well
over the investment period - usually around five years.
The table above, supplied by Swire Fraser, shows some possible results of a
Pounds 10,000 investment. It gives the minimum return to a basic rate
taxpayer; and the returns to both a basic and a higher rate taxpayer
assuming the FT-SE index rises first by 25 per cent and then 50 by per cent.
Many of the bonds also have a maximum pay-out, not shown here.
The bonds are suitable for building society investors hoping for a better
return but unwilling to take risks. Swire prefers those with a high minimum
and a reasonably good stock market link, such as Johnson Fry, Save &amp; Prosper
and Royal Scottish. The Legal &amp; General unit trust (also available as a Pep)
is most suitable for people who might want to pull out their money during
the five-year term.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Turn loss into benefit - How to
maximise tax breaks when a company folds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who backed such fallen UK tycoons as Robert Maxwell or Asil Nadir
will, no doubt, prefer not to reflect on it. But all those with shares in
busted companies should now be thinking how to derive maximum tax benefits
from their ill-fated speculations. Time is running out.
As soon as it becomes clear that the shareholders of a collapsed company
have no chance of salvaging anything, the Inland Revenue announces that the
shares are of 'negligible value'. This enables investors to claim a loss for
capital gains tax purposes without actually having to sell the shares.
Strictly speaking, the loss does not arise until the taxpayer makes the
claim. But because it can take some time for a taxpayer to become aware of a
'negligible value' declaration, the Revenue allow claims to be made
retrospectively. You can back-date to any tax year that ends not more than
two years before the date of claim - on condition that the shares actually
are worthless both when the claim is made and on the earlier date selected
by the taxpayer.
This concession was helpful and straightforward. But it has become a victim
of the controversial decision by Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in the last
Budget to stop the CGT indexation allowance from being used to turn a
capital gain into a loss or to increase the amount of a loss, as opposed to
just reducing a gain. This restriction applies to disposals made on or after
November 30 1993.
Negligible-value assets were a prime target of the chancellor's
loophole-closing zeal. By definition, indexing the value of a worthless
share will always increase a loss. But continuing to allow retrospective
claims would have enabled shareholders to circumvent the new legislation for
a couple more years by back-dating their claims to before November 30 1993.
The Revenue has blocked this by decreeing that a retrospective claim is now
governed by the law in force at the actual claim date.
Had that been the end of the story, our unlucky investors would have been
deprived at a stroke of all indexation on their dud shares. But, in response
to vigorous protests, Clarke granted a measure of transitional relief. Each
individual can now use indexed losses totalling up to Pounds 10,000 arising
on disposals made between November 30 1993 and April 5 1995.
So, someone holding valueless shares must lodge his claim by the end of the
present tax year to have any chance of saving his indexation. If he does
that, he will still qualify for transitional relief, even if he back-dates
his claim to before November 30 1993.
It is not enough, however, merely for the relief to be claimed by April 5
1995 - it must also be utilised by then. So, the order in which the various
types of loss are set against capital gains is crucial.
The first step is to deduct actual - as opposed to indexed - losses for the
year in question. If that leaves a gain of more than the CGT annual
exemption of Pounds 5,800, the gain can then be reduced by indexed losses
for that year. To the extent that those losses are not utilised fully, they
can be carried forward - though not beyond the present tax year.
Say Adam has the misfortune to hold shares in Polly Peck for which he paid
Pounds 3,000. He makes his negligible-value claim in October 1994 and
back-dates to the 1993/94 tax year, which gives him an indexed loss of
Pounds 1,000. In that year, his gains exceed his losses by Pounds 7,000.
Offsetting his actual Polly Peck loss will bring down his net gain to Pounds
4,000. Since this is below Pounds 5,800, the indexed loss is carried
forward. So, the present year gives Adam a final chance to exploit his loss
before it disappears over the Turkish Cypriot horizon.
In the remaining five months of the year, Adam - and all like him - must aim
to make capital gains for 1994/1995 which, after deducting any present-year
losses and the Pounds 5,800 exemption, will still leave enough taxable gains
to absorb his indexed loss. If likely to fall short, he should consider
topping up his gains by bed-and-breakfasting shares with an in-built profit.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Big Brother is watching - Insurers
are keeping tabs on your life style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eat, drink and be merry is cheering advice in this stress-ridden world but,
when it comes to life assurance, Big Brother is watching and taking notes.
He is interested in your consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and cream cakes,
how much exercise you take, who you sleep with, and whether your granny's
heart attack indicates an hereditary weakness.
All these factors are taken into account by life office actuaries when they
assess your risk rating for life assurance. The more convivial your life
style, the greater the likely impact on your life expectancy and the more
expensive this vital family protection insurance will cost.
Term assurance pays out a lump sum if you die within the period covered.
Most company pension schemes include this benefit, but the self-employed and
those without access to a pension scheme must shift for themselves.
Mortgage lenders usually insist that borrowers should take out life
assurance to pay off the loan if the worst happens. And parents saving for
school fees often are advised to use term assurance to guarantee that the
fees will be paid if the main income-earner dies.
With more than 100 insurers offering products in this market, it is
important to shop around for the best deal: with an uncompetitive provider,
you can end up paying double - sometimes more. You should also check if you
need to set up a trust for the policy so as to avoid inheritance tax
problems.
Smoking has long been recognised as a health hazard and insurers began
offering discounts to non-smokers more than 10 years ago. This year, Sun
Alliance and Providence Capitol introduced discounts for 'preferred lives' -
those whose life style and family medical history indicates a longer than
average life span.
If you are under 50 and looking for a minimum cover of Pounds 100,000, Sun
Alliance's 'life style' discount knocks up to 12.5 per cent off its standard
non-smoking rates. A man of 40 who wants cover of Pounds 100,000 for 15
years would pay Pounds 28.80 a month if he was a non-smoker but only Pounds
25.50 with the discount.
To qualify for that, you must not have smoked for five years, drink more
than 21 units of alcohol a week, or work in a hazardous occupation.
Most applicants for standard term assurance are asked to have a medical to
check such things as blood pressure, pulse, and their height and weight
ratio. They are screened also for nicotine (the 'cotenine' test) to check
they were not being economical with the truth over their smoking habits.
They will be asked if any family member (parent or sibling) has had
diabetes, heart disease before age 60, cancer before age 50, or any
hereditary ailment. Anyone taking drugs or medicines regularly, could lose
the right to a discount.
Ronnie Martin, individual risk marketing manager at Sun Alliance, stresses
that the company is not trying to restrict its client base to fitness
fanatics. 'We continue to accept 99.5 per cent of all applications - we are
not excluding anyone. Equally important, we have not put up our standard
rates against which these discounts apply.'
Providence Capitol's preferred lives discount applies to its whole-of-life
policy. This is very similar to term assurance but could also provide a
small cash payment at the end of the term.
The company's executive contract is designed for larger sums assured -
typically Pounds 250,000, with a minimum premium of Pounds 50 a month. But
the equivalent monthly premium for Pounds 100,000 is Pounds 26.70. There is
a similar health screening process to that used by Sun Alliance.
The table, provided by The Exchange database in Woking, Surrey, shows the
top 10 rates for Pounds 100,000 cover for 15 years for a man of 40. Scottish
Widows, for example, charges Pounds 24.55 a month but Scottish Life would
charge Pounds 46.50.
Other insurers are expected to introduce preferred life discounts shortly,
although the most competitive reckon they can hold their market share
without taking this step. But if you are less than super-fit or there is a
family history of, say, cancer, it is worth checking the underwriting
conditions of standard policies. Some insurers ask only for the most basic
information while others require a similar level of detail to the preferred
life questionnaires.
At this stage, it is hard to judge the long-term implications of more
stringent underwriting for the less fit. Big insurers like Sun Alliance
should be able to maintain competitive standard rates - but watch out for
smaller insurers who may cherry-pick the low-risk applicants and either
refuse cover for the rest or raise premiums to an exorbitant level.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: So what's your poison, then? - David
Cohen predicts that the government could have some problems in curbing
abuses of NICs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A short passage tucked away in the middle of Peter Lilley's speech to this
week's Conservative party conference at Bournemouth is likely to have a more
tangible impact on UK taxpayers than all the headline-grabbing rhetoric of
his more illustrious cabinet colleagues.
Unfortunately, so vague was the threat by the social security secretary to
clamp down on schemes designed to avoid paying National Insurance
contributions (NICs) that it is extremely difficult to anticipate what its
impact will be.
Salary payments trigger NIC liabilities for both employer and employee. But
whereas a highly-paid worker is charged only on his first Pounds 22,000 of
income, employers must pay NIC at a rate of 10.2 per cent of all salary,
without limit.
Companies with high-flying employees have successfully mitigated potentially
enormous NIC bills by paying staff bonuses in the form of assets rather than
cash. The assets used are always convertible readily into cash, so the
employees have no complaints.
And since NICs, unlike income tax, generally are charged only on direct cash
payments, the company achieves a 10.2 per cent saving.
This blatant avoidance has infuriated the Department of Social Security. Its
repeated response has been to extend the NIC net to catch the non-cash
benefits then in vogue. But this tactic has proved futile because the
closing of each loophole has led invariably to the discovery of a new one.
In the latest chapter of this lucrative farce, Lilley announced at the end
of August that he was adding diamonds and fine wines to his NIC hit list. In
response, dealers in the City of London - the English capital's financial
district - are now being showered with tasty-sounding platinum sponges and
less tasty - but, apparently, equally cashable - supplies of arsenic.
These peculiarly exotic bonuses will mark the death throes of NIC-dodging if
Lilley has his way. 'I am fed up with spivvy schemes . . . paying yuppies
their bonuses in gold bars, diamonds or vintage wines,' he told the
assembled Conservatives. 'I'll put an end to them once and for all.'
No details were available as to how he proposed to achieve this elusive
objective; his department would say only that an announcement 'in due
course' would reveal the scope and timing of the new measures. Plainly,
though, to make any real headway, the DSS will have to reverse the present
assumption of NIC law that a non-cash benefit is exempt unless listed
expressly.
The danger of such a reversal is that it might vacuum up all sorts of
genuine benefits which Lilley has no wish to penalise.
He showed his awareness of this pitfall by telling reporters, after his
speech, that luncheon vouchers were an example of a perk that would stay
outside the NIC net.
But his lawyers will doubtless explain to him the difficulty of finding
general definitions which are capable of distinguishing a luncheon voucher
from an arsenic certificate.
If the exempt benefits are actually to be listed one-by-one, there will be a
flood of candidates. Employers will insist that a whole range of perks -
from pensions and health insurance to free holidays and clothes - is
provided for good commercial reasons and should continue to enjoy NIC
immunity.
However harshly Lilley wields the knife, three time-honoured techniques for
paying less NICs seem certain to survive:
Employees can be paid in the form of shares in their company. Imposing NICs
on these is most unlikely because it would conflict with the government's
commitment to wider employee share ownership.
If a company can show that people providing it with their services are
self-employed, the whole issue of employer's contributions will never arise.
Owner-managers who control most private companies can trim their NIC bills
by extracting money as dividends rather than bonuses.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (7): Cross-country retreats - There is far more to
do in the mountains than just downhill skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWITZERLAND
A small valley, by a middle-sized valley, near a large valley in southern
Switzerland is a temptress. Do not resist. Leave civilisation behind for a
while and slip into the dream of the Roseg valley.
On either side of the gentle and silent uphill track, the mountains jump
with chamois and deer. Ahead of you is the sheer wall of the 4,000m Bernina
massif that doubles up as the Italian border. At your feet, a river slithers
beneath a snow crust. Apart from the river, there is silence. No cars are
allowed in the Roseg.
Close to the end of the 7km valley, almost at the glacier's foot, is an
outpost of civilisation just when you want it. Bring your appetite with you
to the restaurant Morteratsch. And if the skiing and wine make you too
slothful for the run back to town, catch a horse-drawn sleigh (thick
blankets provided).
The large valley is the Engadine, and St Moritz its most famous name. The
cross-country skier should stay in the prettier, more understated but
equally luxurious Pontresina in the middle-sized valley.
As well as the Roseg, there are long trails in the Engadine. The highlight
is skiing across the frozen lakes south of St Moritz. In the crystalline
air, the landscape of ground glass looks as if it would take a few minutes
to cross. Think again. The other skiers become specks before they get half
way across.
Pontresina is good for learning cross-country. The trails can be as easy as
you want. But Pontresina is not perfect: many runs require a car or train
ride to reach and the town is a little soulless.
NORWAY
Cross-country skiing in Norway is part of the culture. A typical Norwegian
family is happy to consider a four-day trek from chalet to chalet as a
holiday. Resorts are functional rather than luxurious. The food is
calorie-packed rather than gourmet. And the skiing has little to do with a
gentle slide along a bubbling brook and everything to do with going straight
up a mountain.
But the hotels and chalets are cosy with vast open hearths and wood
everywhere. A snack consisting of warm sour cream and hot melted butter,
sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon, will do little for your waistline but is
delicious. You can make up for it by choosing from half a dozen kinds of
pickled herring and mackerel, and have a berry-packed dessert.
The skiing need not be challenging. Rolling hills make it easy to follow
contours. And the feeling that you are on the edge of civilisation is no
illusion.
But the best skiing is difficult by Alpine standards as many of the tracks
go straight up. It is rarely steep, but you need to be pretty fit and have a
good uphill technique to enjoy it.
Those who make it are rewarded with truly panoramic views. The landscape is
reminiscent of Scotland, New England or France's Massif Central.
The sensation of emptiness is partly psychological. Norwegians claim more
second homes per head than any other nationality. There are hundreds of
chalets and cabins hidden around the cross-country skiing village of
Sjusjoen alone.
Learn cross-country before you go to Sjusjoen. There are two part-time
instructors - farmers really - and most of the visitors learnt to ski before
they could run.
Non-skiing activities, too, are very Scandinavian. Do not miss the
extraordinary experience of dog sledding.
This is not a comfortable Alpine holiday, but it is real. Norwegians are
modest and gentle and cross-country skiing is their way of life.
AUSTRIA
Seefeld's pedestrianised high street seems, after a snowfall, to have been
designed for picture postcards. The motorway to Munich and Zurich is just
over the mountains and there is a railway station at the edge of town.
There is cross-country skiing ranging from attractive beginners' routes in
sunny meadows to hilly woodland trails that are the experts' raison de
skier.
Add to that medieval houses, open-air ice skating and bath-hot swimming,
even some downhill skiing, and you have a winter resort worthy of the
phrase.
The cross-country skiing is as well organised as you would expect from a
town that has twice hosted Austria's Winter Olympics' Nordic events.
Most of the trails fan out from a point a few minutes walk from the town
centre. On the beginners' routes there are always at least two parallel
tracks, making lessons straightforward.
The expert trails can be difficult in places with steep curving descents.
But in the silent pine forests, it is worth the effort.
Seefeld is not cheap. And at 1,200m the season is short.
ITALY
Most cross country skiers at the last winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer
spent their final few weeks of preparation in the host country. Not Manuela
de Centa, however, who went on to win two gold medals for Italy.
Her town is Livigno, for training and living. It is an extraordinary winter
resort that has more in common with a wild west boomtown than other Alpine
resorts or sedate Norway.
It lies in one of the most isolated valleys in the Alps. A treeless bowl
whose inhabitants have exploited their duty-free status by building 200
shops and half a dozen petrol stations.
Straggling along the valley floor, the shopping attracts bargain-hunting day
trippers from Switzerland and downhillers from Italy, Germany and the UK.
The valley itself has plenty of Alpine skiing, but little to excite the
langlaufer. The official runs are through summer meadows that, because of
the one-valley nature of Livigno, never stray far from buildings and petrol
stations.
Away from the official tracks, however, it is possible to ski in serenity
and as such would make a passable introduction to cross country for a day or
two.

<TEXT>
Why should you want to haul yourself about on skis while the ski lift could
do the work? Why plod through the snow with the brakes on when you could be
swooping like a bird amid the peaks?
If you are asking these questions, you have never tried cross-country
skiing.
Sir Norman Foster, the architect, has been an enthusiastic cross-country
skier for more than a decade and has more-or-less completed the switch from
downhill.
He says that cross-country skiing is easy. 'It's fantastic at every level.
It works for little old ladies who go out for a walk on skis to the most
incredible athletes in streamlined clothes.'
Before you even start, you feel the difference.
The boots are like running shoes and the skis weigh ounces. On day one, with
zero technique and on the flat, each normal walking step takes you two
metres.
After a week, you can climb into woodland off-piste and enjoy the
exhilaration of being in mountain peace that mechanised Alpine skiers do not
know exists.
Choose your resort carefully. Few people can cross-country ski from dawn to
dusk. Make sure that you have the options of shopping, dining, skating,
curling, sleigh riding, hot pool swimming, dog-sledding, ice fishing or just
strolling.
Then rediscover all the things that could be done in winter before they were
buried by the avalanche of Alpine skiing.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: From Russia with confidence - Forget
those rouble problems. John Thornhill finds that some investors believe in a
glowing future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like murders, investments need a means, motive and opportunity. While the
anti-market Communist party ruled the Soviet Union for 74 years, none of
these factors applied to Russia. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union
in 1991 and the helter-skelter growth of capitalism, many investors believe
they can make a killing in the land of Lenin.
Mark Mobius, president of the Templeton emerging markets fund - one of the
most successful in the sector - certainly shattered some pre-conceptions by
forecasting that Russia's fledgling capital markets could become as big as
those in the US within 20 years. He told the FT he believed his Dollars 8bn
fund would have a 20 per cent weighting in Russia within 10 years, and
added: 'It is an explosive investment market.'
There was no shortage of rivals ready to attack such seemingly outlandish
views. It is easy enough to find the ammunition. Russia's economy is still
in the middle of a colossal upheaval, with industrial production falling 28
per cent in the past year. The rouble has resembled a yo-yo this week,
losing 21.5 per cent of its value on 'Black Tuesday' but rising by 25 per
cent on 'White Thursday'. And although the political situation has grown
more stable over the past few months, it remains precarious. Yet, some
investors now believe that the potential rewards of buying Russian assets
more than outweigh these macro-risks.
Russia is a country of vast natural resources, with 150m well-educated
people and a high technological base. Following its mass privatisation
programme, 120,000 capital-hungry companies have been transferred into
private ownership. Some could emerge as extraordinarily profitable
businesses and highly attractive investments. 'The seeds of growth have been
sown by the privatisation programme and the capitalist genie has been let
out of the bottle,' says one western fund manager.
The big problem with many of these potential investments, however, is that
no one yet knows their true financial condition. Russian accounting is
rudimentary and financial information about companies and their markets
scanty or non-existent. Thus, trying to value companies on any traditional
methods, such as earnings or cash-flow multiples or dividend yields, is all
but impossible.
Instead, investors pay more attention to the valuations ascribed to the
privatised companies' assets and, on that basis, many of them look
extraordinarily cheap by global standards. To take just two examples, Baring
Securities calculated that, in August:
The value of Gazprom, which owns more than 30 per cent of the world's known
gas reserves, was about 0.3 cents a barrel of oil equivalent while that of
British Gas was about Dollars 10.30. The value of Rostelekom, which has 80
per cent of all telephone lines in Russia, was about Dollars 49.35 per
access line while that of NTT of Japan was about Dollars 2,429.
The market value of the 30 largest Russian companies which form the Moscow
Times index have a total value of Dollars 22bn - less than that of some big
companies in the FT-SE 100.
Such seemingly seductive calculations have led to a rapid influx of foreign
capital into Russia in the past few months, mainly from private investors
and hedge funds. CS First Boston, which is the most active western
stockbroker in Russia, says it is buying on behalf of 95 western funds and
forecasts that the total inflow of foreign capital this year could reach
Dollars 3bn. That sum, however, is still likely to prove less than Russia's
capital flight.
As in all emerging markets, Russia is a case of hot money chasing a fast
story, and the investor has to discount much wild talk. In illiquid markets,
sentiment is often critical and there is no shortage of speculators trying
to talk up the price of shares.
The speculative bubble might well have been pricked already, with leading
shares showing some sharp falls in the past few days. But the longer-term
hope would be that once Russia sorts out its securities legislation, more
serious long-term capital will flood into the country, creating a more
stable and sustainable investment boom.
At present, however, mainstream investors are deterred by a host of
micro-problems. As yet, there are no effective clearing or settlement
systems and it can be extremely difficult simply to buy and sell shares  -
the spreads between bid and offer prices can be as much 50 per cent.
Share registration is also a nightmarish process. Buyers have to list their
purchases on the company's register, which means having to visit some remote
Siberian towns. There is no guarantee that the names will not be erased
after being entered, and there are bound to be huge problems and scandals as
the market develops. No fund manager who takes his fiduciary
responsibilities seriously should yet be prepared to invest.
Change is happening fast, though. A group of leading Russian companies,
wishing to attract foreign capital, has produced its own investors' charter
to introduce higher financial standards and greater corporate governance.
The government promises a new securities law. A national settlement system
is being developed and foreign banks are setting up custodial services. If
these issues are resolved rapidly, there is perhaps a real possibility that
Mobius's prediction might not prove so fantastic.
The emerging markets team at Morgan Grenfell last month published a report
forecasting a possible 500 per cent rise in the stock market in dollar terms
by 1996. 'Russia has the potential to be the outstanding stock market for
the rest of the '90s, just as Japan was in the second half of the 1980s,' it
concluded.
Maarten Pronk, Moscow representative of ING - a Dutch bank which spans both
commercial and investment banking activities - says: 'In truth, nobody knows
how big this market can get. It might grow as big as the US, Japan or
Germany. Who knows? But Russia needs the capital - and it has a huge
capacity to grow.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: For those with a special affinity to
plastic - A look at the growth of credit cards from organisations seeking a
more personal touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What do the plastic contents of your wallet say about you? Are you a Porsche
driver? A Burberry wearer? A Manchester United fan? A Sunday Times reader?
Perhaps a a National Trust member or a supporter of the Canine Defence
League?
For the past few years, letter boxes throughout Britain have been stuffed
with mail shots offering colourful credit cards that proclaim your
attachment to an organisation or a brand name. Hundreds of these 'affinity'
cards are available in the UK.
They cover every conceivable kind of organisation: charities, professional
bodies, trade unions, universities, newspapers, motor manufacturers, and
amorphous interest groups such as anglers, gardeners and golfers.
Affinity cards work just like normal Visa or Mastercards and are issued by
banks, but their designs are specific to the organisation concerned and made
attractive so that holders are encouraged to use them. Many carry no annual
fee, or waive it if the card is used more than 10 times a year or for
spending more than Pounds 1,500 or Pounds 2,000 annually.
Some, particularly from the smaller issuers, have lower interest rates than
standard bank credit cards. MBNA's annual percentage rate is 17.9, or 13.9
per cent on cash advances. Beneficial Bank's rates vary from 17.5 per cent
(Law Society and Institute of Directors) to 21.9 per cent (Manchester United
and British Sub Aqua Club).
Charities have been particularly active in promoting affinity cards because
they provide an extra source of revenue, even though the sums involved are
not large. Typically, a charity (or other organisation) will receive about
Pounds 5 when a supporter signs up, then 0.25 per cent of what is spent.
So, if someone spends Pounds 500 a month, the charity will get Pounds 1.25,
or Pounds 15 over the year. This is not a great deal - but the charity does
also get a mailing list of very sympathetic names.
The range of affinity cards in the UK has not yet reached the scale of the
US, where a quarter of credit cards involve some affinity or partnership
arrangement. Some American towns even have their own cards to bring in
non-tax income, and middle-aged rockers can pay for their CDs with a Rolling
Stones credit card - complete with lips logo.
The UK is catching up rapidly, though. Those who are proud to wear their
political colours on their sleeves - or in their pockets - are well catered
for.
The Royal Bank of Scotland runs the Conservative party credit card, while
the Co-operative Bank juggles with both the Liberal Democrats and the Labour
party. Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party have yet to join the
plastic society.
Design is important. The University of Cambridge card (Beneficial Bank)
carries a picture of the Senate House, the only building used by all
university members - a picture of one of the colleges would have alienated
graduates of all the rest. Likewise, the Jaguar card has a striking picture
of the big cat rather than a specific model, and the MG Owners' Club card is
illustrated with a vintage car.
The success of an affinity card depends not only on how many potential
card-holders a group has but also on how keen they are to be associated
publicly with the group. This could vary: as the proud owner of a Tottenham
Hotspur Visa card, (Beneficial Bank), you might think twice about using it
near a rival ground.
Some cards are aspirational: you do not necessarily have to own a Burberry
coat or Porsche car to be able to flash its logo around on a credit card.
And a few offer extra perks.
The Bank of Scotland entices applicants for its gardeners' card with a free
seed catalogue. Holders of Burberry Visa cards (MBNA) earn points towards a
discount on their next purchase, while applicants for Toyota or Lexus cards
(MBNA) get the chance to win a new Toyota Corolla car.
The 35 trade union cards offered by the Bank of Scotland charge a lower
interest rate than the bank's other affinity cards but, in return, the
unions forego the usual Pounds 5 donation for each new card-holder.
The Ford Barclaycard and GM Card (HFC Bank) are slightly different - they
are 'co-branded' commercial cards, rather than affinity cards. Their aim is
to promote brand loyalty by letting users earn substantial rebates on new
Ford or Vauxhall vehicles.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (6): Grunge on the slopes - Snowboarding styles
and nostalgia are dictating ski fashion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Skiwear follows fashion like few other sports. Its trends mimic the
mainstream but, like good pupils turning after their instructor, they are
always a bit behind.
Sleek glamour may be re-asserting itself in high fashion but skiers still
appear to feel that a hard-edged one-piece spattered with gilt studs and the
logo of some expensive German label is passe, if not naff.
As ever a year behind, skiwear is in the grip of nostalgia and grunge, with
which the snowboarding cult is closely associated. Snowboard style now calls
the shots in ski fashion, which is odd considering the mutual distrust
between the two disciplines and the determination of snowboard riders, with
their own vocabulary and look, to maintain the separation.
With no necessity for a team identity and the need to wear more rather than
less, the skier can be anybody he or she wants to be under the anonymity of
hat and goggles. People do not always choose the skisuit you might expect,
though practical considerations enter the equation.
There is little point in wearing gear built to withstand the rigours of
extreme skiing if you are trundling round the nursery slopes.
But many intermediates have flattered themselves with the latest expensive
techno-suit.
Skiwear companies are now jumping on the snowboarding bandwagon with special
ranges.
Reusch's is functional, with tough ripstop fabrics, anti-wear patches and
long-backed smocks.
More fashion-orientated are Tokka Tribe from Luhta and Eikowada from
successful British skiwear firm Nevica which two years ago caused a stir by
taking over the high-status, high-tech French label Killy with the blessing
of Jean-Claude, its eponymous ex-ski champion founder. Ironically, he
nowadays rides snowboards rather than skis.
So to be a downhiller with dash, you need to look as if you own a board. The
style appeals partly because its individualist scruffiness is a statement
against slick designer uniformity and partly because baggy, fleece-lined
layers are relaxed and comfortable to wear.
There is also the crossover factor from ski to street wear. For the
occasional skier, a subdued fleece-lined parka has added value as weekend
wear.
The style goes right through the market with budget-conscious C&amp;A having
snowboard logos emblazoned across its fleece-trimmed, ripstop smocks and
anoraks.
The snowboard influence has resulted in a considerable quietening down on
the slopes. Gone are day-glo brilliance and loud prints, replaced by
near-dreary grunge colours and naive patterns pioneered by labels such as
Oxbow, which originated in windsurfing.
Fleece fabrics are essential, as an extra layer or to wear alone on warmer
days, and as a soft, warm trim on everything from collars to caps. Even
ranges known for their technical quality, such as Schoffel, now include
fleece items.
Skiwear now has an improvised, street-inspired mood. Jackets and salopettes
or trousers no longer need to match and can be worn with an ordinary big
sweater or lumberjack shirt for a look reminiscent of pre-package trip days.
Nostalgia is a good alternative for those who feel that apeing a snowboard
shredder may be a fraction too hip.
Predictably, some fashion skiwear firms have cashed in, notably Post Card,
an Italian range whose darkly rich-looking waisted parkas and sleek stretch
trousers are sophisticated, dateless and the nearest thing to investment
skiwear. Belfe is an associated mid-market range with a similar look; Chervo
is on the same lines.
A tougher offshoot of nostalgia is the backwoods look of chunky, square
shapes, neutral matt fabrics, leather trims and checked brushed cotton
linings. Primarily American, the Deerhunter look has inspired European
labels such as Nevica's Chinook range. It is popular with British men
perhaps because the dull colours remind them of the tweeds and wax jackets
in which they feel more at home.
There are two areas of skiwear which, though apparently eclipsed
fashionwise, have enough of a following to stay afloat. One is technical
gear.
This is the world of competitive fabrics, breathable linings, high-tech
insulation, and names like Degre 7, Tenson, Mover and The North Face. It has
hitherto been a male domain but Schoffel and Nevica now recognise that women
can also ski hard and high and are making high-specification suits in a
feminine cut.
The other, in complete contrast, is the snow bunny. Grunge style should have
rendered her an endangered species. But there are plenty of slim-waisted
one-pieces and pert, bottom-revealing jackets to tempt her, this year in
soft, pastel iridescents (from V de V, Nevica and C&amp;A) or glowing, oriental
mixes of flame and saffron or royal blue and purple (from Luhta).
The trousers may be more generously cut and the shoulders softer than
hitherto but the message is the same - glamour. If skiwear follows the
catwalk as usual, by next year the snow bunny will be the winner of the
fashion slalom.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: One for the books - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIVIEN MACDONALD, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the week's largest sales took place at Sterling Publishing, a book
company, where Michael Preston, the non-executive deputy chairman, sold more
than 497,000 shares at 130p. While this wiped out his equity in the company,
the disposal was made for personal financial reasons.
Alphonsus Schouten, managing director of the European division of Laura
Ashley, the fashion to fabrics company, sold 100,000 shares - all his
ordinary stock - at 72p. The shares are trading at around 70p. The sale of
1.2m shares at Bluebird Toys comes only a month after CD Burgin bought
stock. In the most recent transaction, chairman Torquil Norman raised Pounds
2.48m by selling more than half his holding at 207p.
The shares were placed with institutions and Norman has undertaken not to
sell any more stock for at least a year.
The directors of Sheffield Insulation have been cautious in their
transactions over the past year. The most recent deal was by non-executive
chairman Norman Adsetts but still leaves him with more than 3.87m shares.
The sale came shortly after the group had announced strong interim results
and looks like a small profit-take.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The need for fair dealing - Diary of
a Private Investor / New laws should get wider publicity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange declared recently that it was 'committed to
investor protection and the need to ensure fair dealing on its markets for
all'. The statement came in a consultation document on 'orderly markets:
dealings ahead of the disclosure of price-sensitive information'. Yet, while
the sentiments are fine, thousands of private investors are being kept in
suspense.
The exchange revealed that, in the previous 12 months, there had been 7,000
'price jump alerts' where unusual upward movements in share prices had
prompted investigations, although only 130 cases had failed to result in a
satisfactory conclusion.
Where there was not a satisfactory explanation, the exchange said its policy
was to investigate further to see if price-sensitive documents had been
'leaked', and to discover if there was any evidence of insider dealing or
market manipulation. It would also investigate any unusual falls in a
company's share price.
During the year, around 70,000 company announcements were made through the
exchange, a high proportion of which could be regarded as price-sensitive.
The exchange is now considering 'trading halts' - of not more than 24 hours
 -in any company's shares where there is strong evidence that
price-sensitive information exists but has not been announced officially,
and where it appears that the unusual market activity is due to a leak. This
seems like a good idea.
But the document suggests, also, that trading halts could result in a full
suspension in cases where the situation has not been resolved satisfactorily
within 24 hours. While a suspension certainly stops anyone else from
profiting by buying the shares, it means also that existing investors in the
suspended company are, effectively, 'locked in': they cannot sell their
shares.
Unfortunately, where a company is suspended because of 'bad news'
announcements, investors often find themselves stuck with shares that turn
out to be worthless when the full state of its finances is revealed. Some
people, with access to the company's condition, may well have dumped their
shares before the suspension - but the ordinary private investor has been
unable to do likewise.
He could have to wait months - or years - before he learns the final sad
fate of his investment. Indeed, he might never be told directly because some
companies which go into receivership have too few assets to pay for a
circular to shareholders giving them the bad news.
Even where there is no fraudulent activity or insider dealing, shares could
be suspended to ensure that no one can benefit from any information of a
price-sensitive nature that might emerge. My wife could not sell her 1,000
shares in Dominion International in 1989 when the company announced it was
in financial difficulties and asked for its listing to be suspended. The
shares proved worthless when the company was put into administration in
1990.
Fortunately, we did not invest in Queens Moat Houses, the shares of which
have been suspended since the end of March 1993 but there are other
companies which, despite being in financial difficulties, have had their
shares traded freely right up to when the receivers were called in.
Similarly, while some companies will ask for a temporary suspension pending
a take-over announcement, others will not.
Provided that adequate warnings are given, however, I feel shares should not
be suspended. The exchange has suggested that it could issue a 'new market
alert' and draw attention to any unusual price movements in a company's
shares. This is an excellent idea, as is the suggestion that the exchange
should have the power to require member firms to reverse share deals where
the exchange has reason to believe they were carried out with the benefits
of unpublished price-sensitive information.
In the past, the exchange's investigations have sometimes run into the brick
wall of an offshore nominee which refuses to disclose its true ownership.
But new legislation to prevent money laundering came into effect on April 1.
It requires financial services businesses (including stockbrokers) to have
anti-money laundering procedures. These include verifying the identity of
the people on whose behalf a transaction is to be carried out.
Failure to introduce these procedures can result in imprisonment for up to
two years and a substantial fine. But I feel there has not been enough
publicity about these new rules, especially as even failure to report
suspicions of money-laundering to the National Criminal Intelligence Service
can result in imprisonment for up to five years and a hefty fine.
Perhaps insider dealing and the need for suspension might be reduced if the
NCIS embarked upon a major publicity campaign to alert people to the new
legislation.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent British Healthcare, which has 17 hospitals spread between
Stirling in Scotland and Tunbridge Wells in Kent, has deferred its plans to
float this month, writes Christopher Price. Chief executive Keith Chadwick
said the group, which was hoping for a market capitalisation of Pounds 45m,
was 'not prepared to sell cheaply - it's that simple'.
Two other casualties of adverse market sentiment are Martin Retail Group, a
Pounds 100m float, and shellfish producer Seaperfect, a Pounds 20m placing.
BrightReasons, owner of the Pizzaland chain and due to float later this
month, was denying reports of its postponement, although it said it reserved
the right to do so. A board meeting soon will decide the issue.
Gardner Merchant, the catering group which had been expected to float at
some stage soon, disappointed some observers at its results meeting this
week when the company, a Pounds 402m mbo from Forte in 1992, distanced
itself from early action.
Undaunted, Eurovein, a Sheffield-based engineering group, announced plans to
raise Pounds 14m when it comes to the market.
TLG, the holding company of Thorn Lighting Group, unveiled operating profits
of Pounds 6.06m (Pounds 2.63m) for the five months to the end of August with
its pathfinder prospectus. It is due to float next month.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: Highland Distilleries, maker of Famous Grouse, the second-largest
whisky brand in the UK, is expected to report pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 42m for the year to August 31, up from Pounds 38.8m a year earlier.
MONDAY: Eurotunnel's results for the first half of 1994 will contain the
first real numbers, as opposed to forecasts, in the company's seven-year
existence. Even so, delays in the start of services mean there will still be
only about five weeks of freight operations by which to judge performance.
TUESDAY: Third-quarter figures from drug company SmithKline Beecham will be
scanned for clues to the company's progress in integrating DPS, the drug
distributor it bought for Dollars 2.3bn in May. The nine-month pre-tax
profit figure should nevertheless be well above Pounds 900m, compared with
Pounds 841m in the first nine months of 1993.
WEDNESDAY: Smiths Industries is expected to post a full-year pre-tax profits
advance of about 9 per cent to about Pounds 114.5m, and the dividend is
expected to be lifted in line with a forecast 8 per cent growth in earnings.
Recent acquisitions have strengthened the company's industrial group, in
particular, although the US health-care business has also been bolstered by
June's Dollars 150m purchase of Deltec, a US medical equipment manufacturer.
THURSDAY: Amstrad, the consumer electronics group run by Alan Sugar, has
been affected considerably by the problems of the personal computer industry
and indifferent consumer electronics sales in the high street. Full-year
pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 5m are expected.
FRIDAY: Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, which on
Thursday sold its Stratford baked bean canning operation for Pounds 37.1m,
is expected to report annual profits of around Pounds 40m, excluding
exceptionals.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (4): Let's take the kids - When are children ready
to ski?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Through the eyes of a child, skiing (or other activities when mummy and
daddy are skiing) can be thrilling - or a torment. Being 'abandoned' in the
snow, or just in an unfamiliar room, with a stranger and other children can
be a traumatic experience.
Even in the friendliest resorts, there are weeping children suffering
because their parents have gone off without them. Even the chance of
learning to ski is no guarantee of being cheered up: on a bad day, it can be
cold, miserable, boring or just plain frightening.
Whether the child is to ski or simply be 'supervised' in a nursery rather
depends on the age of the child and the attitude of the parents.
Just because 'local' children in the mountains come bombing down the slopes
at the age of three or four, it does not mean that this is a good age at
which to start British children. Children who live in the mountains are
virtually born on skis.
In my own experience seven or eight is a good time to start. Four or five
might work, but this is a more risky age. If things go wrong it might wreck
your holiday and put the children off skiing a second time.
My two older daughters first skied when they were seven and five. It was not
an unqualified success, but they at least came back for more.
My younger two (twins) learnt when they were 11 - almost a perfect age.
They charged along on piste and in powder as if there were no difference,
and never had the problem in later life - as so many skiers do - of
struggling with powder as if it were some alien substance which had no
connection with normal snow.
Whether the child or children love skiing or loathe it can make all the
difference between a successful skiing holiday (which was the case when my
twins started) and a disastrous one (almost the case with my five and seven
year olds).
And for non-skiing children, good ski kindergartens can be an equally
important component of a ski holiday.
More and more ski areas are realising that the way to encourage parents to
return the following year (preferably with their children) is to find better
solutions to the question of what to do with the children.
Here is part of Riki's ski kindergarten's schedule at Mayrhofen, Austria:
'10am-12 noon: We ski to the Fairyland and to Snow White's House.
'12 noon: Lunch followed by a relaxing break in the 'Ahornhutte'. Rest by
the log fire, watch cartoons or play games with our qualified nurse Anni and
the instructors.
'1.30-3.30pm: Ski course at the Carousel on the 'Camel-bumps' over the
'Eagle Jump' and more.
'4pm: Your parents are collecting you at the bottom station of the cable
car. No classes on Saturdays]'
If only it were always that simple. In spite of cheerful enterprises such as
Riki's, some children remain almost inconsolable. Threatening them with 'a
good clip round the ear unless you stop blubbing]' - as a friend of mine
used to do - is unlikely to be the answer.
Short of the longed-for return of one or both parents (perhaps not
applicable in the case of my friend), how can these unfortunate youngsters
be cheered up?
Not by reading (assuming they are old enough to read) one rather dour
document prepared by St Anton, Austria, which seems to promise little hope
of happiness, for the child at least. It reads: 'Parents staying within the
municipal boundaries of St Anton who wish to spend the day unencumbered by
the children can bring them to the Youth Centre for half or full-day
supervision (including food and beverages). Visiting children must be aged
at least 2 1/2 years.'
But it is perhaps Mayrhofen which sums up the basic prerequisite for happy
children on the slopes: 'In our children's ski school, children are taught
to ski in a playful manner, without fear. Our ski instructors are patient
specialists with lots of ideas and sympathetic understanding.'
Off the slopes, Mayrhofen will even supervise children as young as three
months in their Babycreche, and older infants in Wuppy's Kinderland.
Some American ski areas - notably Vail and its sister resort Beaver Creek -
have entire mountainsides devoted to children's skiing theme parks, where
young skiers with their own instructors can ski through all kinds of exotic
features such as Dragon's Breath Mine, where the dragon 'roars' as you ski
through it, and the Hibernating Bear cave. (The bear is rather more stuffed
than hibernating, so anxious parents should not worry about it suddenly
waking up.)
The Big Mountain, Montana, suggests real animals. They offer: 'Free dog sled
rides for kids - with Dog Sled Adventures]'
And Mammoth Mountain, California, has a Kid's Camp and a Mammoth Explorers'
programme for Junior Explorers (aged between four and six) and 'proper'
explorers aged between seven and 12.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: So you're thinking of going offshore
. . . - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Bethan Hutton explain what it involves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The word 'offshore' conjures images of white sand, palm trees and discreet
financial dealings. But offshore investment these days can be as close to
home as Dublin and Luxembourg, and is open to ordinary investors as well as
millionaires.
Offshore, just as onshore, there are big differences between unit and
investment trust-type investment funds, although they may not bear the same
names. The distinction made is between open-ended funds (like unit trusts)
and closed-end funds (like investment trusts).
There is a huge variety of offshore open-ended funds aimed at private
investors but, so far, they have not had much involvement in closed-end
funds.
INVESTMENT TRUSTS
Offshore closed-end funds, just like investment trusts, are registered as
companies, and listed on a stock exchange. This often involves two separate
places: for example, a trust could be registered in Jersey but listed on the
Dublin stock exchange. Some trusts are registered offshore but have London
listings; this makes them more accessible to UK investors.
Why offshore? Funds tend to be launched this way because it is quicker and
cheaper than setting up a new investment trust in London. Regulation is
lighter and the tax treatment is more favourable. Also, managers have
greater freedom to invest in the newest, riskiest emerging markets than they
would with a London-based fund.
Recent offshore launches have included trusts concentrating on Russia,
eastern Europe, North Africa, the Indian sub-continent and other markets
which are only just emerging. A large number are single-country funds, which
are riskier than broader-based regional or international ones, and most are
aimed at institutional investors.
Offshore closed-end funds are only for the wealthy and the brave. These
funds plunge into emerging markets at a very early stage. They can give
private investors the chance to get in at the same time as the really big
players; but although there is the possibility of sometimes spectacular
gains, you are also running much bigger risks by investing in untried
markets (see Russia on page V).
A few offshore investment trusts have crept back onshore recently because
the markets in which they invest, and the investors at whom they are aiming,
have changed over time.
The trend to move onshore can present an opportunity to alert investors, as
discounts on offshore funds are considerably wider than onshore funds.
According to Rupert Lea, of Baring Securities, a London-listed Far Eastern
investment trust might have a discount of less than 10 per cent, while its
offshore equivalent might be at 20 per cent or more. So, when a fund moves
onshore, existing investors stand to gain simply by the likely narrowing of
the discount.
Most offshore funds have a limited life span of five to 10 years, so another
approach is to look for a fund at a wide discount with two or three years to
run. If you hold until wind-up, you will receive the value of your share of
its assets, rather than the discounted share price.
Tax. The treatment of closed-end offshore funds depends on whether the fund
has a limited life and, if so, how long it has to go until wind-up. If the
fund has an unlimited life, or more than seven years left when you invest,
income and gains will be treated in the same way as from UK investment
trusts, including the use of the annual capital gains tax allowance and
indexation. But if the fund has less than seven years to run, and unless it
has distributor status (see below), both income and capital gains are taxed
as income.
Buying and selling. There are no legal barriers to buying offshore
investment trusts - only practical ones. Information on them is hard to
find: some funds are listed in the FT (under managed funds or investment
companies), particularly those with a London listing, but by no means all.
Otherwise, you might have to look to specialist brokers and analysts for
information.
Finding a private client stockbroker willing to deal in offshore closed-end
funds is the biggest hurdle for private investors; very few are able to
advise on them. Once you have found a suitable broker, you also face higher
dealing costs than for London-listed investment trusts.
Fidelity Brokerage, for example, charges Pounds 100 commission on
transactions up to Pounds 2,500 of non-UK or US shares, compared with Pounds
25 on UK transactions up to Pounds 2,500. It is probably cost-effective only
if you are dealing in relatively large amounts - say, Pounds 5,000 or Pounds
10,000. Most offshore funds are dollar-denominated, so you could also have
to set up a foreign currency account.
Then, you have to consider other dealing problems. The main markets for
these funds, such as Dublin and Luxembourg, are much smaller and less liquid
than the London stock exchange. It can be difficult to get the size of order
you want, and the bid-offer spreads may be wide. Most markets do not have
market-makers: deals go through on a matched-bargain basis. If turnover in a
particular fund's shares is low, you could have to wait for a counter-party
to surface. Likewise, it might be difficult to sell precisely when you want.
Mudi Onoberhie, an analyst at specialist country fund broker Olliff &amp;
Partners, says this is because many of the offshore funds do not expect to
have an active after-market in their shares. The funds have a limited life,
and the majority of investors are expected to stay in from launch to
wind-up.
David Bowen, a director of Jersey-based stockbroker Jefferson Seal, says he
is wary of investing in offshore closed-end funds which often publish asset
values only once a month. Investors may have to buy shares without knowing
the real current asset value, and this can be particularly worrying in the
more volatile emerging markets which can fall 30 per cent from one month to
the next.
If you do decide to invest in such a fund, Bowen recommends ensuring peace
of mind by picking one run by a big, reputable fund manager which also
manages onshore funds.
UNIT TRUSTS
There are a very large number of open-ended offshore funds. Looking at the
list of offshore funds which the FT publishes on its Managed Funds pages
gives an idea of their number and variety.
Why offshore? Investment freedom has been a major reason although this will
soon become largely redundant when a change in the rules of the Securities
and Investments Board - the chief City regulator - will give fund managers
greater scope.
Onshore unit trusts have not been allowed to invest more than 10 per cent of
the fund in a market not on SIB's 'approved' list. The list will disappear
from the beginning of November when the onus will shift - as it does in
other countries - to the fund managers. Tax advantages. Onshore unit trusts
have to pay income net of basic-rate tax to UK residents, but offshore funds
pay income gross. The funds are, for UK tax purposes, divided into
distributor and accumulator funds. Distributors must pay out 85 per cent of
income as dividends and must not have more than 5 per cent of their assets
in any one company. UK investors pay income tax on the dividends, but any
other profits are taxed as capital gains.
Accumulators, mainly cash and bond funds, do not pay out income but 'roll it
up' within the fund. The gains are taxed as income, not capital gains, but
only when investors sell their holding. So, roll-up funds are often used to
postpone a tax liability.
Since tax is postponed, investors can compound their investment gross rather
than net, which improves performance.
Marketing to the EU. In 1989, the European Community issued its UCITS
Directive (Undertaking for Collective Investments in Transferable
Securities) to allow funds regulated in their home state to be marketed to
other member states.
But because the structure of unit trusts in the UK is still very different
from open-ended funds abroad - the rest of Europe, for example, has single
pricing instead of the dual 'bid-offer' charging structure in the UK - many
companies set up offshore subsidiaries to take advantage of the cross-border
marketing opportunity. Moves towards single pricing in the UK should result
in its introduction next year.
Regulation. SIB can either 'authorise' or 'recognise' collective investment
schemes - the generic term for open-ended investment funds. The only type of
collective investment fund authorised by SIB in the UK is the unit trust,
but it will recognise some offshore funds based in EU member states insofar
as their marketing to the UK public is concerned. Only SIB-recognised
offshore funds can be retailed in Britain.
SIB can also recognise funds based in Guernsey, Jersey, the Isle of Man and
Bermuda - known as 'designated' territories. About 80 per cent of offshore
SIB-recognised funds are well-known UK names and include Fidelity, Guinness
Flight, GT, Rothschild and Gartmore. The funds can be bought either through
a UK-based intermediary or through the UK-based offices of the operator.
The Investors Compensation Scheme, which offers protection of up to Pounds
48,000 to UK investors, applies only to authorised schemes. But it can be
triggered if an investor, who bought an offshore fund through an authorised
intermediary which went bust, can show he lost his money as a result of bad
advice.
Some countries have a compensation fund covering the schemes which they
authorise. To find out, contact the regulatory body in that country.
Cost. Charges on offshore funds can compare favourably with those onshore -
particularly since, because of single pricing, there is no 'spread' - the
difference between the bid and offer price on onshore unit trusts. The
initial charge on offshore funds run by Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant
banking group, is 4.5 per cent with annual charges of between 1 to 1.5 per
cent, depending on the type of fund.
Some surveys, however, have criticised the charging structure of some
offshore funds. London-based management consultant Timberlake &amp; Co. found
that, in some cases, total expenses - which include the cost of
administration and marketing - can be twice as high (and sometimes even
higher) than that indicated by the annual charge.
Further information. Performance tables for open-ended funds are listed in
Money Management and Resident Abroad, both monthly FT publications. Money
Management is available at many newsagents for Pounds 4.50. For more details
about Resident Abroad, contact Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (3): Tell us when it's over - A battle-scarred
Arnie Wilson expects no sympathy as he puts his odyssey into perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world trip
Some days, when bad weather forces us to wait for a chance to scramble for
the slopes, I feel like an old airman who forgets why he is fighting. If we
finish this mission, we shall probably keep skiing and moving on to the next
resort until someone tells us the war is over. It has not really been like
the western front, of course, but sometimes it has been quite a battle.
My left hand has quite a nasty burn, inflicted by a New Zealand rope tow out
of the ark; my thumb is bandaged after cutting it on the rough-hewn metal
lock of a door in a primitive mountain hut; my big toe nail has come off
after constant rubbing against the inside of my ski boot; my left shoulder
still hurts eight months after two bad falls in California and the middle
finger of my right hand is still deformed after being broken while skiing in
a gale on a volcano in Chile - and I suffered a frost-bitten nose in
Colorado.
Lucy also has a toe nail coming off as well as bruised ribs, and a shin
bruised by a rock. Between us we have fallen 285 times, or about once each
every 18 miles skied. We have frequently looked ridiculous by skiing in
fields and by the side of the road in places miles from any ski resort. I
mention all this not for a moment expecting sympathy (it all adds up to
nothing compared to the ordeals of real winter adventurers such as Sir
Ranulph Fiennes) but to put this glorious skiing odyssey into some
perspective.
In between the bumps and bruises, we have skied the vertical equivalent of
well over 100 Everests in more than 200 resorts, travelling the equivalent
of four times round the world at an average speed of 14mph - every hour, day
and night - since January.
There have been good days, ecstatic days, wet days, cold days, boring days,
dangerous days, windy days, frustrating days, and argumentative days when we
swore we would ski separately but ended up on the same lift almost
immediately.
We have slept in luxurious hotel suites, freezing mountain huts, rickety old
trains and more than once in a Russian truck. We have fled from hotels and
refuges where Lucy found the accommodation unsuitable. One night in
Wisconsin we rejected two hotels in one night, the first because of
cleanliness, the second because Lucy discovered we were to sleep on a
water-bed which she feared would make her seasick.
We have been transported to the slopes by Aerospatiale squirrel helicopters,
Pilatus Porter ski-planes, high speed quads and low speed single grip rope
tows, an assortment of four-wheel drive vehicles, snow cats of various
vintages, and - in half a dozen resorts - on foot.
We have skied in powder, crud, breakable crust, moguls, windpack, suncrust,
man-made snow, frosted powder (whatever that is), hoarfrost, rime and on
quite a lot of ice (sometimes euphemistically referred to as hard-packed
powder).
We still like skiing (and each other), although there has been little
improvement in my technique. Lucy has done rather better: she has learnt to
ski quite well off piste.
Avis have lent us 14 vehicles so far - two at once for a few days in Chile.
The most intriguing (but not the most practical) was a Cadillac which had
its keys locked in the boot by Lucy, possibly in a subconscious attempt not
to have to ski on a converted garbage dump just outside Chicago in the
middle of the night.
We have come to know Chicago quite well because it is an important hub for
American Airlines, our airline sponsors for the northern hemisphere. We have
visited this city more than half a dozen times en route to various mountains
and hillocks.
The best part of our trip - apart from some breathtaking scenery and skiing
 -has been the quite extraordinary kindness shown to us along the way,
particularly in Canada, Argentina, the US, Chile, Australia and New Zealand
(plus the long-suffering Manfred Ebner who kept putting us up in his hotel
and looking after bits of our luggage in Kolsass Weer, Austria, as we
criss-crossed Europe). The skiing industry seems to attract delightful
people.
We have been interviewed by 14 TV stations, 11 radio programmes and 56
newspapers, including one in Japan that we could not read, and everywhere we
go, certain questions are asked again and again:
'How long will your skiing every day of the year trip last?' Er, yes. That's
the whole point.
'But you don't ski the day you fly though?' Er, yes. That's the whole point
too.
We ski any time, any place, if necessary. At midnight, at dawn, in a field,
off a cliff. If there's snow, we ski it. If there is not, we find it. If we
can't find it, we ask someone to make us some, as we did in Cloudmont,
Alabama, and shall be doing at the end of this month in Mammoth, California.
Our daily priorities are simple: breathe, eat and ski.
I do not think there are many major ski areas in the world we have not
visited (except perhaps Crans Montana, Switzerland and Marmot Basin at
Jasper, British Columbia). But if we have left anyone else out please invite
us immediately. We are free throughout 1995.
What does all this prove? Well, nothing yet, because we still have another
10 weeks to go, and anything could happen. If we do happen to make it to
Jackson Hole, Wyoming - where we started our mission on January 1 - and
succeed in skiing every day of the year, it will prove that while it is
possible to ski every day of the year it is virtually impossible to do so in
ski resorts on lifts that are open.
Our trip will also perhaps have proved what we always knew: when the British
(and Lucy, although French, is an honorary Brit) started the strange habit
of going on winter sports excursions, everyone thought they were mad.
Nothing has changed.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Markets: Investors search hard for new worries - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street's latest inflation scare seems to be over - at least for now.
After fretting about whether factory and retail prices rose sharply in
September or not, investors' nerves were calmed this week by data showing
surprisingly a low inflation rate.
The news lifted bonds and stocks, which were given an additional boost by a
promising opening to the third quarter reporting season.
Yet, the warm glow left by the September inflation figures will soon fade,
probably by Monday. Once the new week starts, investors will start worrying
about something else. Will this be the last quarter of strong corporate
earnings before the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightenings start to
take effect? Will the dollar weaken further? Is the economy still growing
too strongly for the Fed's liking? Thus, will the central bank sanction
another rate increase before the end of November?
Soon, it will time for investors to start fretting about the October
inflation data, and the whole cycle can begin again, for Wall Street just
cannot seem to shake its inflation bug, even after this week's reassuring
statistics. On Thursday the government reported that producer prices fell
0.5 per cent in September, the steepest decline since August 1993.
Yesterday's consumer prices data were almost as encouraging, with the
consumer price index rising just 0.2 per cent last month.
Since the start of the year, producer prices have risen 1.9 per cent, and
consumer prices 2.8 per cent. This means that the rate of inflation has
barely budged since last year, even though consumers continue to spend, jobs
continue to be created and the economy continues to grow at an impressive
rate. Investors worried about inflation have been unable to draw much
comfort from the low rate of price increases because they cannot believe
that current solid economic growth and low inflation can last for long.
Yet, there are some good reasons why inflation is low now, and likely to
stay that way: commodity prices remain low (the threat of another conflict
in the Gulf this week actually led to a decline in oil prices); global
competition is preventing companies from raising prices and labour demanding
higher pay; technological development continues to forge efficiency gains
and depress wages; and companies continue to respond to high costs by
restructuring their operations rather than raising prices.
Then there is the Fed factor. Interest rates have been raised five times
this year, and this tightening of policy should eventually take its toll on
the economy. Assuming that it does, and economic growth slows down in 1994
because of the Fed's actions, it is safe to assume that any inflationary
pressures in the system will also ease next year. If inflation is running at
around 3 per cent this year, it is difficult to envisage it rising much
above that rate in 1994.
At some stage, the bond market is going to wake up to the fact that
inflation is not going to prove as bad as they expected. When it does, long
term interest rates, which are hovering around 8 per cent today, should come
down. Until that happens, however, the stock market is probably going to
continue to struggle to break out of its trading range, which over the past
few months has left the Dow Jones industrial average stuck between 3,800 and
3,950.
At least investors can draw strength from corporate profits, which looks as
if they will post handsome growth in the latest quarter. Although there were
a handful of disappointments (Weyerhauser, CBS, JP Morgan), the trend in
earnings remains positive, and four companies which represent a good
cross-section of the US economy - Chrysler, Pepsico, Apple Computer and
Motorola - all had good news this week.
Chrysler's was the most impressive. The carmaker posted a 54 per cent
improvement in three-month profits to Dollars 651m as demand for its most
popular models in North America again outstripped supply. Analysts expect
Ford and General Motors to perform equally well.
Pepsico's results also came as a pleasant surprise to analysts and
investors. The group reported an 18 per cent increase in earnings to Dollars
541.4m as soft drinks sales growth offset disappointing sales in the fast
food division. The news lifted Pepsico's stock by Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
34.
Apple Computer and Motorola, meanwhile, helped provide a boost to a flagging
technology sector. Motorola's profits jumped 50 per cent to a record Dollars
380m in the third quarter, while Apple said it would beat analysts'
forecasts of its earnings when it reports fiscal fourth quarter profits next
week, news which lifted the company's stock to a new 14-month high of
Dollars 39 5/8.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Markets: The Soros way to sensible investing - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International speculator George Soros calls his theory reflexivity. The
investor cannot make a totally objective assessment of markets, for his own
views become one of the factors which influence future developments. A
market consensus results in a bias, which can sometimes affect not just
market prices but events in the outside world of fundamentals - which those
market prices aim to reflect.
So, the investor is not just shooting at a moving target - he is shooting at
a target which is moving all the faster because he is chasing it. There is a
double feedback mechanism at work. As Soros himself puts it: 'The stock
market is generally believed to anticipate recessions; it would be more
correct to say that it can help to precipitate them. Thus, I replace the
assertion that the market is always right with two others:
'1. Markets are always biased in one direction or another.
'2. Markets can influence the events they anticipate.'*
A neat example of reflexivity in action was last month's decision by
chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George to
increase base rates from 5.25 to 5.75 per cent. The minutes of that meeting,
published this week, make it clear that the attitude of financial markets
played an important role in the decision.
The chancellor noted that the markets were expecting interest rates to be
raised sooner rather than later. He was concerned that if their expectations
were not realised, markets could become more volatile and the eventual
increase might need to be larger.
George, who had proposed the increase, admitted there were arguments for
delaying it but worried that such delay would increase the dangers -
including financial market dangers. So, in the end, Clarke decided that an
immediate increase in rates would be an act of prudent economic management.
He added that moving rates then would keep the authorities in control,
rather than being driven by the market. (Even chancellors need comforting
illusions).
The markets' expectations altered the course of events because of the
influence they had on people with the power to fulfil those expectations.
The base rate increase was premature. But an investor analysing the economic
fundamentals correctly, and investing on the assumption that there would not
be an early increase in rates, would have been wrong-footed.
So, the intelligent investor needs to do more than consider the relevant
fundamentals in any market. He needs also to weigh up the opinions of other
influential investors and how people in the real world are likely to react
to their perception of those opinions.
If all this sounds hard, that is because it is. Soros himself once
commented: 'I make as many mistakes as the next guy. Where I excel is at
recognising my mistakes.'
This week produced a couple of salutary reminders that equity investment is
as much about risk as about reward.
The first, described in detail on page V, comes from Russia. Emerging market
fund managers, following Templeton's guru Mark Mobius, are eyeing Russia as
the next honey-pot in the making. Barely was the ink dry on the first press
reports of Mobius's enthusiasm, when the rouble plunged by a fifth - only to
make up virtually all its lost ground two days later. Not quite like the
home life of our own, dear Footsie.
The other is a continuing horror story called Aerostructures Hamble. Floated
on the UK market in June at 120p, it touched 21p yesterday after profit
warning piled upon profit warning. A small lynch mob is prowling the City,
furious that no details of the problems appeared in the prospectus.
Remember Benjamin Graham's adage: 'Most new issues are sold under
'favourable' market conditions - which means favourable for the seller.'
Guaranteed equity bonds - which combine a capital guarantee with some
exposure to the stock market - are aimed mainly at building society
investors (see page VII for some ongoing offers). So, why have they been
made so complicated that the terms are hard even for professional advisers
to assess? There is no easy way to pick out the best buys - the answer
depends on your assumptions.
All the bonds have slightly different minimum repayments; different
percentages of your starting capital are linked to different multiples of
FT-SE growth; some have a cap limiting the maximum return. What you get
depends on your tax rate. And comparisons with other investments have to
adjust for the fact that these bonds produce no income.
Yet, they are being sold to people who are assumed to be stock market
virgins.
September's inflation figure - the lowest for 27 years - is good news for
most. But not for pensioners. The September figure for the annual growth in
the retail prices index (clocked at 2.2 per cent) is the one on which
increases in state pensions and other benefits are based. Everybody's good
news is somebody's bad news.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Markets: Lucas? Leave it to George - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Simpson has descended on Lucas Industries with the aura of a messiah.
The man who turned Rover Cars into such an attractive proposition that BMW
of Germany arrived to buy it can spread his magic over Lucas. George will
fix it.
This week, he used that reputation to add lustre to his first plans as chief
executive of the component-maker - a company which, he said, had been 'a
little bit accident-prone, but it's got better in the last couple of years.'
The lustre hung over annual results which, instead of making hardened City
men blink and call for management changes, sent the market price winging
upwards.
The plans were designed to show 'a determined management team' gripping the
issues, concentrating 'on a narrower spread of core activities' with the
vision of being 'a global leader in the provision and support of high
integrity systems for the automotive and aerospace industries'.
The results reflected the plans: a financial clearing of the decks in
readiness for change. They gave the initial impression that any conceivable
piece of bad news which could be thrown in had been thrown in; exceptional
items of Pounds 213.9m led to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 129.7m. In the normal
course of events, the announcement of provisions more than twice as large as
the direst prediction would send a stock price downwards. But not Lucas this
week: its price climbed towards 200p from 177p.
Beyond the Simpson factor, enhanced by his public appearance of cool
determination, there were a number of reasons for this. First, the markets
for Lucas products are improving: automotive is strong and will strengthen
further as France and Germany emerge from recession, while aerospace looks
as if it will not deteriorate further.
So, there was not much problem for the analysts in predicting improved
earnings and, on the back of that, at least a maintained 1994-95 dividend of
7p. Albert E. Sharp, for example, suggests pre-tax earnings this year of
Pounds 125m compared with Pounds 84.2m in 1993-94 before the exceptional
items.
Second, the exceptional items were not as fierce as they first looked. 'Only
40 per cent of the provisions taken against profits have a direct cash
implication, and this will be partially offset by the expected proceeds from
divestments,' said Simpson. Third, the shares carry a yield of about 4.5 per
cent, higher than the sector average, and this is helping to hold the price
up.
Whether the share price will be sustained depends on patience with Simpson
and his team. Even he acknowledges it will take two or three years to
complete a rationalisation programme and to improve financial performance.
There is a familiar look about all this. Lucas has been rationalising or
shifting focus - all the vogues - ever since 1981. In 1984-85, it had what
reports of the time called 'a comprehensive programme' to jack up efficiency
and reduce costs. 'Too many products and too many plants' was the cry then,
just as it is now.
Lucas seems always to be doing what conventional wisdom suggests it ought to
do. It was an early UK exponent of Japanese management systems. In the
second half of the 1980s, when it again became more fashionable to
diversify, Lucas diversified into the sort of software and systems companies
it now cannot wait to sell. Recession pushed it back into trimming mode:
'modernisation of facilities and integration of operations into fewer
sites,' it announced in October 1992 as it declared restructuring provisions
of Pounds 88.4m, a larger sum than Simpson has put aside for the same
purpose.
So, what is new about George? He does not present himself as an avenging
angel. Rather, he talks of accelerating change. He works off the base of
Lucas technological skills: at the hardest times, the group held up its
research and development spending. His particular emphasis will be changing
the presentation of the technology, giving it what he calls 'market pull'.
Lucas will seek not just to present its wares to the market but to fashion
its wares to the needs of the market. George Simpson knows about customers.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Markets: Equities surge after bond clouds clear - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a difference a few days can make. The surge in equity prices this week
reflected a growing belief that US and UK interest rates will not have to
rise - at least not yet.
The recovery in London shares started towards the end of the previous week,
when US payroll and unemployment data failed to provoke a feared increase in
the Federal Reserve's interest rate. A string of further economic indicators
this week calmed inflation concerns in the US and led to a strong
performance by both bond and equity in the Europe and the US.
The resurgence of the London market culminated on Thursday with a 41.4-point
rise in the FT-SE 100, following confirmation that US producer prices were
still subdued. Although the FT-SE shed 35 points yesterday, it still closed
104 points up on the week - and 150 points above its trough at the beginning
of the month.
Not all the good news came from the US. Conservatives meeting at the party's
Bournemouth conference were able celebrate the fall in the UK's underlying
rate of inflation to 2 per cent last month - its lowest level for 27 years.
September's figures also suggested that falling unemployment was not
resulting in pressure for higher wages.
Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said bond markets in the
UK and abroad were exaggerating the likely upwards movement in inflation in
the industrial countries, including Britain. The governor told the
British-American Chamber of Commerce that financial markets were also
probably exaggerating the likely pace and size of the increases in
short-term interest rates that might be needed to keep inflation down.
The governor's remarks found a ready reception in the City. A survey showed
UK fund managers had already become much more optimistic about gilts
following last month's base rate increase. The balance of fund managers
looking to increase gilts holdings had this month jumped to 47 per cent from
4 per cent in September.
As the clouds over the bond market dispersed, investors and traders were
able to take a fresh look at recent corporate performance. NatWest
Securities pointed out that the autumn reporting season had not been a
disaster - in spite of a few high-profile cases such as BTR, the engineering
group which warned of margin pressure, and SG Warburg, the merchant bank
which revealed big trading losses.
The chart shows that most company results and trading statements have
exceeded market expectations - leading analysts to upgrade their profit and
dividend forecasts.
However, low inflation does not always spell good news. Albert Fisher, the
food processing and distribution group, this week opted out of the UK's
baked bean price war, which has seen supermarkets selling own-label beans
for 7p a can or less. It sold a canning and bottling plant at
Stratford-upon-Avon to Campbell Grocery Products, a subsidiary of the US
food group, for Pounds 37m.
The depressed state of the housing market has also not helped Nationwide
building society, which agreed to sell for just Pounds 1 a total of 304
estate agency branches it had acquired for Pounds 120m since 1987. Financial
services groups paid high prices in the late 1980s for estate agencies, in
the hope they could use them to sell a range of services such as home loans
and insurance policies. The collapse of the housing market has led to
mounting losses, closures and disposals.
Any complacency over the inflationary outlook could also prove premature.
The cost of raw materials used by British manufacturers rose significantly
last month as the surge in world commodity prices pushed up the expense of
imported materials. The cost of goods leaving factory gates rose at a
relatively subdued rate, suggesting that many companies are still being
forced to absorb rising costs.
Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components group, managed to
report a slight increase in profit margins - but this was mainly because of
a sharp reduction in the group's workforce, which has been cut by 3,200 to
45,700 in the past year. Lucas shares rose, even although its new chief
executive, George Simpson, announced a further refocusing on the
Birmingham-based company. The former Rover chairman's plan involves further
disposals and a total of Pounds 214m in exceptional charges - double
previous forecasts.
VSEL, the Cumbrian-based maker of Trident nuclear submarines, faces
restructuring of a different kind - being swallowed by another large defence
contractor. GEC, the defence and electronics group, is this weekend
considering whether to make a cash offer for VSEL, to counter an agreed
all-share bid worth Pounds 479m from British Aerospace. Whichever group
emerges victorious, the outcome will mean a further significant step in the
consolidation of Britain's shrinking defence sector.
Being taken over by a competitor might be a blessed release for
Aerostructures Hamble, the aircraft components maker which came to the
market in June and has already proved itself the worst performer of the
recent wave of flotations. The shares, launched at 120p, yesterday collapsed
to 24p after the group reported a sharp drop in interim profits, warned that
next year's sales would be well below this year's and said its chief
executive was stepping down because of ill-health.
Institutions have become jaundiced about the quality of some of the new
issues which have been flooding on to the market. The chairman of
Aerostructures Hamble is Lord King, the former chairman of British Airways.
He and NM Rothschild, the merchant bank which advised on the group's
flotation, can expect some stiff questioning from irate investors.

Investors in BT3 (the third tranche of shares in British Telecom) responded
strongly to the call for the third and final instalment on the shares, due
last week - 94 per cent paid up by the due date, compared with 91 per cent
for the second call on BT2, and 88.5 per cent for the second instalment on
shares in the regional electricity companies. Shares of investors who do not
pay on time are taken by the Treasury, sold, and the proceeds returned less
costs. Shareholders paid a total of 410p; BT shares last week were trading
at just under 400p.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Tough times for the rouble - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a tough week for the rouble. President Yeltsin sacked his
finance minister on Wednesday after the rouble fell 21.5 per cent against
the US dollar on Tuesday. On Thursday, amid rumours of heavy intervention by
the central bank, it bounced back 20 per cent. The central bank's foreign
currency reserves have been heavily depleted this month.
The reason for the rollercoaster currency movements is not entirely clear,
but there has been speculation that the collapse was engineered by
conservatives hoping to discredit the reform process and destablise the
government.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Pink Snow (1): A mountain of choice - Peter Whitehead finds
FT readers have very varied tastes when choosing their top resorts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For the third year in a row Val d'Isere has been voted the FT readers' most
popular skiing resort. The French resort topped the readers' list of
favourites, polling 65 of the 440 votes cast.
It is particularly popular with expert skiers. And while it was also
favourite with intermediates, they put Courchevel and Meribel close behind.
When it comes to skiing regions, it is a different story. Votes for resorts
in the Trois Vallees skiing area - Courchevel, Meribel, Val Thorens and Les
Menuires - put it way ahead of any other linked area.
The most striking result of the survey, however, was the astonishing variety
of resorts favoured by FT readers. There were 110 different resorts
mentioned as favourite resorts by the respondents to the questionnaire.
That so many people have so many good things to say about so many different
resorts is an indication of the enormous variety of skiing available and the
generally high standards set by most resorts.
Resorts from as far afield as Mount Hotham in Australia, Chapelco in
Argentina, several in North America and a host of little-known retreats in
every corner of Europe were featured.
The questionnaire was only included in the UK and European editions of the
FT, hence the heavy bias towards European resorts.
And as the bulk of respondents were from the UK, it is unsurprising that
French resorts featured prominently at the top of the table. Indeed,
France's big three - Val d'Isere, Courchevel and Meribel - polled more than
a third of the votes.
The scale and variety of the skiing available at these resorts is what
readers mentioned over and over again, with many expert skiers citing the
excellent off-piste skiing at Val d'Isere. Scenery is quoted by many
favouring Zermatt, Wengen and St Anton.
Many people cited getting away from the crowds as reasons for their choice.
Susan Jane McCartney of London likes Hinterstodder as it is mainly Austrians
who go there. And Christina Cock also chose an Austrian hideaway, Galtur,
because it is 'at the end of the valley, so has little traffic and few tour
companies'.
The train is popular in Wengen and views of the Matterhorn swayed a number
of respondents into voting for Zermatt.
Erica Platter of South Africa said she preferred Les Gets because it was
'still a real village with heart and soul, not some artificial tourist trap
full of tinsel and flash'. And Martin Woodhead of Saffron Walden, Essex
likes it so much he has bought a chalet there.
Courchevel attracted such comments as 'unrivalled variety of terrain with
superb snow record and immense lift system', and 'long, long empty runs'.
The long season and exquisite scenery of Zermatt were what prompted Anthony
Leech of London to name it as his favourite, while Peter Clarke of
Chichester, West Sussex said: 'Tough skiing and best food in the Alps.'
Tudor Jones of Gloucestershire called Zermatt the 'nearest place on earth to
heaven'.
Lorraine Geddes of Inverness said Val Thorens was her favourite, in spite of
its looks: 'Ugly and cold,' she called it, 'but superb easy access to
wonderful off-piste and no need to queue'.
Of Val d'Isere, Kristine O'Brien from London said: 'I never get bored,'
although she did point out that it was not good for small children.
Chris Scanlon of Maidenhead, Berkshire, has a special reason for favouring
Val d'Isere: it is where he met his future wife. And Ian Britton remembers
Wengen as the place where his girlfriend accepted his proposal of marriage.
Champery was chosen by Martin Wood of London for its 'quiet, civilised
village, its rapid access to the Portes du Soleil and short airport
transfer'.
Kathryn Long of London has mixed feelings about Jackson Hole: she said it
was her favourite for the skiing and the snow - 'but the town of Jackson is
as dead as a doornail'.
Ozlem Peksoy of Istanbul, an expert skier who has skied widely in Europe,
was loyal to his home country's resorts when it came to picking his
favourite: 'Palandoken, Turkey is extremely exciting, sometimes dangerous,
with steep long tracks and natural moguls,' he said.
Janet Iliffe of Surrey, was impressed by the 'American attitude to service'
and voted Breckenridge her favourite. And 'queue discipline, efficient lifts
and the general atmosphere' led Sam Eadie of Cheam, Surrey, to put Vail top.
Graham Burnett of Staffordshire, said of the Bulgarian resort of Vitosha:
'Probably the only resort where you can ski all day and be at a state opera
house on time in the evening.'
Favourite tour operators were many and varied: 68 different tour operators
were chosen by readers as their favourite. Those mentioned most frequently
as top preferences were Supertravel, Bladon Lines, Mark Warner and Inghams.
The Ski Company's luxury appealed to many readers and good things were also
said about smaller companies such as Ski Scott Dunn, Powder Byrne and Ski La
Vie, with skiers liking their flexibility.
It seems that staff are the key: clients who liked the people with whom they
came into contact tended to be enthusiastic about that company.
Even so a quarter of those replying to the questionnaire said they preferred
to make their own arrangements.
Many thanks to all readers who wrote about their skiing experiences and
technique tips. We enjoyed reading them but lack of space means that, sadly,
we have not been able to include them in Pink Snow.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Democracy in Haiti - will the rich buy it?: As Haiti's
President Aristide returns from exile, James Harding considers the ruling
elite's role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Water. One word can stand for all the difficulties and dangers which beset
Jean Bertrand Aristide, the president of Haiti, on his return from exile
today, under the protection of American guns.
The first thing that strikes a visitor to the slums of Port au Prince is the
ceaseless procession of people with 10-gallon buckets on their heads, to and
from the well.
The second thing that a privileged visitor might notice is the elegance of
the villas on the surrounding hills. The rich people who prospered under a
succession of dictators, made their homes up there; and they are unhappy.
Water is abundant among the shady patios, the bougainvillaea, and the
landscaped gardens. But the swimming pools are green with algae. During the
turmoil, electricity supplies have been so unreliable that it has been
impossible to keep the pools properly filtered.
Thousands of poor Haitians, who lack the simplest necessities, are expected
to throng the streets today, to welcome back their champion, the first
president ever to be elected by popular vote. But if Aristide wants to keep
the crowds cheering, and to show that democratic freedom can also bring them
running water, he may be forced to look first to the needs of the bathing
classes.
The most prominent of these are are six mainly mulatto families, who
dominate the Haitian economy and have subtly exerted power over even the
most vicious of recent rulers. Some, at least, appear to have been deeply
implicated in the ousting of Aristide in favour of the most recent military
dictator.
Through the years of 'murderous kleptocracy' in Haiti, as Duvalier rule from
1957 to 1986 has been called, and the short-lived dictators who have
followed (apart from seven months of democratic rule in 1991), the families
which own the commercial monopolies have all but run the Haitian economy and
acted as the puppeteers for the country's leaders.
The US government has won at least a superficial blow for democracy by
paying its dues to Haiti's economic elite. Aristide, who was elected as a
radical reformer, will have to overcome a hostile legacy and do the same if
anything like a free country with a stabilising middle class is to be
developed.
In the 1980s, the US circulated papers linking five of the leading families
to the dictators and their murderous paramilitaries. Now the US government
has come to terms with the oligarchs. It knows that if you want democracy in
Haiti, you have to do business with the families which own it.
When former President Jimmy Carter came to Port-au-Prince to negotiate the
US and Haiti out of war and into a co-operative restoration of Aristide, he
made a point of feting the local barons with grand dinners and intimate
talks. General Henry Hugh Shelton, US Commander of the Joint Task Force in
Haiti, has gone one stage further and entered into leasing agreements on
their properties.
Despite the US courtship, the grandees will not be on the streets cheering
Aristide home. Although most paint themselves as champions of democracy few
have fond memories of the liberation theologist's brief spell in the
presidential palace.
'We didn't have democracy under Aristide,' says Olivier Nadal, secretary
general of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce. 'He was constantly attacking the
bourgeoisie . . . his mob was in the streets, he sent people on to my land,
to take away my land. We could still work, but it was very scary.'
Most business leaders hope, but are not convinced, that three years in
Washington will have tempered the anti-bourgeois rhetoric of the populist
preacher swept into power in 1990 by the mass coalition, Lavalas - the flood
meant to wash away corruption and emancipate the Haitian poor.
Nadal finds it hard to believe that Aristide has changed and refers to
sermons such as the one in which he talks of ' . . . the class of landowners
and the bourgeoisie who live off the corrupt system we have in Haiti, who do
nothing, who give nothing back to the country, who steal what little wealth
we have and put it into banks in foreign countries, their private property
is . . . Haitian property, it does not belong to them.'
The wealthy should be accustomed to the people's struggle. Haiti, the only
country in the world to have witnessed a successful black slave revolt, has
a strong history of popular uprisings and movements for street justice or
dechoukaj.
But such hostility is not what the business families had come to expect of
Haiti's rulers. Quite the opposite, relations had historically been cosy.
The half dozen clans are not the inheritors of French colonial wealth dating
back two centuries. They multiplied their capital over the last 50 years
thanks to a deft handling of governments which granted them monopolies in
exchange for support and financial favours.
The Behrmanns made their money on concessions to import cars and trucks. The
Madsens control beer and much of the coffee. The Bigios are sole producers
of iron, steel and construction materials. The Accras, the textile magnates,
have benefited from government contracts for school and army uniforms.
The most prominent business families, the Mevs and the Brandts, have
diversified considerably since the days of Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier, but
their empires are also built on exclusive rights to trade and produce.
The Mevs family has invested in port terminals and energy facilities based
on capital from their manufacturing and sugar production monopolies. The
Brandts have diversified similarly on the back of their original detergents
and edible oils origins.
The proximity of businessmen and the military is barely disguised. When
Gregory Mevs, president of the infrastructure interests of his family's
multi-faceted business, fumbled to find his business card on introduction,
he joked: 'I have so many generals and colonels walking through my office
every day, I don't need business cards.'
They mix socially and have a history of what one Haitian called 'financial
friendship'. Some business families are thought to have supported Gen Raoul
Cedras, the Haitian army chief who led the military government until last
week. Originally, he was appointed by Aristide. Now the preacher-president
will be hoping his latest offering to the army, General Jean-Claude
Duperval, will be more loyal to the Haitian executive than the board of
directors.
The Brandts are understood to have funded an anti-Aristide lobby in
Washington DC. The Mevs have been accused of compliance with the military
regime which usurped power in a bloody coup in 1991 and, at worst,
protecting some of its members to ensure the survival of their business.
However, the Mevs insist they are ultimately pro-Aristide and seek
'political stability and good democratic institutions'. But then, in
gatherings of the elite, polished rhetoric, like lobster and French wine, is
abundant.
The vogue is vocal enthusiasm for elected government and every family member
paints his clan as champions of the democratic process. But, slowly.
'Democracy is the ultimate goal,' Gregory Mevs explained. 'It is a process
to work at. No one gets there in under 24 hours . . . if you take the
history of France, democracy is a new animal for them; it took them hundreds
of years to get there.'
If the international touch to the Haitian problem is alien to most
Port-au-Prince residents, that is in keeping with the elite's image. The
most distinctive quality common to nearly all the business families, beyond
their uncommon ownership of German sports cars, country homes and
functioning international telephone lines, is their colour.
Most are non-black. They are mulatto, many with French, German, Syrian,
Lebanese or Jamaican backgrounds.
The anomaly has spawned a Haitian proverb: 'A poor mulatto is black, but a
rich black man is a mulatto.'
Distance from the poor is not only a question of colour. It is also one of
altitude. In Port-au-Prince, the rich demonstrate the resilience of luxury
in the hills of Petionville suburb. The middle classes are getting by
halfway down in Delmas. And most of the people, with next to nothing, are in
shanties on reclaimed land below sea level at Cite Soleil.
From behind the white-washed perimeter walls, iced with barbed wire and
bougainvillaea, it is easy to take a patrician view of democracy.
As Aristide returns and the embargo is lifted, Petionville, should spring
back to luxurious life, but Delmas is the area to watch. It has skilled and
educated workers without jobs.
The population of Delmas would staff the 'democratic institutions' Mevs is
seeking. The people of Delmas would also appreciate the 'democratisation of
capital' advocated by men such as Johnny Brandt, a member of the less
prodigious wing of the Brandt empire.
But for Delmas to witness real changes, the business families will have to
overcome one further obstacle: their incessant bickering.
The Brandts and the Mevs have been feuding since 1949. According to one
Haitian socialite, the Mevs are still sore that the Brandts were able to
build a detergent factory on land formerly owned by the Mevs, allegedly by
manipulating President Magloire into appropriating the property from the
sugar grandees.
As US troops have spread throughout Haiti over the last four weeks, a sense
of shame, a call for self-sacrifice and patriotic rhetoric have become
common among the Haitian oligarchy. They strike a note of mea culpa and
claim responsibility for endowing the bulk of the population with education,
political rights and economic development.
Brandt, his white shirt open and showing a gold chain tangled in chest-hair,
is one of their number. Sipping on a rum coffee, he says: 'Some of us are
going to have to play the Jean d'Arc here.'
President Aristide, often referred to as Haiti's foremost biblical scholar,
will appreciate the saintly tone of self-sacrifice. Nevertheless, he may
need to get the swimming pools clean before he finds the Haitian oligarchs
ready to help him put his house in order.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Long View: Basildon misses out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the battle-hardened commentator on Britain's financial and economic
affairs, the news seems just too good to be true. This week, underlying
retail price inflation fell to a bare 2 per cent, the lowest since 1967
while, coincidentally, unemployment figures showed a continuing fall,
reflecting an economic growth rate which may be close to 4 per cent. An
unexpected export boom is, meanwhile, shrivelling the balance of payments
deficit.
The financial markets have certainly decided that they overdid the gloom
temporarily in September. In the gilt-edged market, fixed interest yields
have been falling while the real yields on index-linked gilts have scarcely
changed - a sign that inflationary fears are receding. Indeed, powerful
deflationary forces continue to grip the western economies (although
inflation is not dead - it has just moved to Russia, where the rouble has
plunged against the dollar and shopkeepers were reported to be writing up
imported food prices by 50 per cent on Wednesday).
In the UK, however, you have to be some kind of monetarist nutter fretting
about M0 - which is rising at a slightly worrying 7.1 per cent year-on-year
 -to be especially troubled about inflation. In fact, annual inflation has
probably now bottomed out: wholesale raw material prices are rising at a
more vigorous 5.7 per cent and it will be hard to repeat last year's trick
of a stand-still in retail prices between September and February, so
year-on-year inflation will tend to edge up. But the broad money measure,
M4, is growing at only 4.7 per cent, so there is absolutely no prospect that
any acceleration of inflation will be of great significance.
No wonder Bank of England governor Eddie George was in a frustrated frame of
mind this week when he spoke out against the pessimism of the financial
markets - which appear to be expecting base rates and inflation to jump.
That could have been an implied hint that interest rates will not rise any
further this year.
Yet, British economic management, for all its glow of achievement, is still
a long way from becoming respectable. It is, after all, only just over two
years since the ignominious exit from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Since then, more by luck than judgment, the government has achieved the
first half of a brilliant economic strategy. This was to trigger a highly
successful devaluation, which has stimulated economic recovery without
generating inflation.
There is, however, a second stage of the transformation to be achieved,
because the British economy remains seriously distorted. The outsized public
sector deficit, a legacy from the recession and the public spending bonanza
which won the 1992 election, is falling but is still likely to be about 5
per cent of GDP in the present financial year. The counterpart to that heavy
public sector borrowing is the build-up of large surpluses in the private
sector. The company sector, for instance, ran a financial surplus of Pounds
9.5bn in the first half of 1994, while the corresponding surplus for the
personal sector was Pounds 10.8bn.
The recent benign trends in the economy have depended upon restraint in the
private sector's readiness to spend its wealth - aided, of course, by the
higher personal taxes which are redressing the imbalances only gradually.
All the same, a spending spree could yet give the economy a push along its
familiar path towards inflation and a balance of payments crisis.
Two factors seem important in restraining the personal sector. One is the
continuing high level of unemployment - despite the overall decline from the
peak - and the unusually high levels of insecurity in a hire-and-fire
economy. The second is the chronic sickness of the housing market, which
appears to have been dealt a nasty blow by the half-point rise in mortgage
rates.
According to the Halifax building society, house prices, after their attempt
at recovery starting last winter, are now back to 1993 levels and are
unlikely to pick up again before next spring. September house buying and
selling activity, reflected in the Corporate Estate Agents' index was 5 per
cent down on the same month last year.
There is a positive way of looking at this: it might just go to show what an
inflationary disaster the politically- motivated over-stimulation of the
housing market has been for the British economy over 30 years. Some of the
last subsidies and distortions are being removed (mortgage interest tax
relief will be restricted to 15 per cent next April) and demographic factors
are turning negative.
So, we can hope that future economic growth will no longer necessarily lead
to a credit bubble and consumer boom focused upon house prices and equity
release (that is, mortgage money spent on consumer goods). Symbolically, the
Nationwide building society has just sold 300 loss-making estate agencies
for Pounds 1 the lot.
Whether Basildon Man - that barometer of the nation from Essex - will see
the positive side of this, as his prospect of escaping the negative equity
trap retreats for another year or two, is another matter entirely. This is
not the way the Tories won four elections in a row. They may soon worry that
it is not the way they will win the next one. But if this economic upturn is
to stay steady and well-balanced, George and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke will
have to keep the housing market clamped down. Arguably, that was the primary
aim of last month's interest rate rise.
Clarke could calculate, however, that surely there would be no harm in a
modest house price boomlet in, say, late 1995 and 1996. He will also want to
cut personal taxes ahead of the next general election. Such manoeuvres would
not help George to coax the money market and gilt-edged yield curves into
shapes which he might regard as reasonable. But at least veteran columnists
would find themselves back in familiar territory.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Size of RJB coal offer surprises rival bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining offered at least 50 per cent more than the next highest bidder to
become the government's preferred candidate to buy British Coal's English
mines, it emerged yesterday.
The gap will raise questions about RJB's assessment of the coal market and
its ability to cut operating costs. Fellow bidders and British Coal
executives have been surprised by the size of RJB's Pounds 900m offer.
None of the bidders will discuss its tender, but RJB's offer for the three
English regions is understood to compare with considerably less than Pounds
600m from English Coal, a management buy-out team.
RJB and English Coal were the only companies that bid for all three regions.
However, Coal Investments, a quoted company, is thought to have offered
about Pounds 510m for the two central regions, which are the bulk of the
English assets. The third region, the north-east, is judged by analysts to
be worth less than Pounds 80m.
Some of the failed bidders hope RJB, which has a market value of less than
Pounds 160m, will be unable to raise the more than Pounds 1bn it needs to
finance the bid and provide working capital.
However, to win the government's backing RJB and its adviser Barclays de
Zoete Wedd will have provided strong evidence that the money will be raised
before the scheduled completion of the British Coal privatisation on
December 24.
Ministers also sought reassurance on the long-term viability of RJB's
business plan.
Mr John Reynolds, analyst at James Capel, said yesterday that on his
assumptions for the coal market and RJB's profit margins, the company would
have 'crippling debt' and would provide negligible returns for equity
investors after 1998.
That is the year contracts with electricity generators expire. RJB assumes
the electricity generators will want more than 45m tonnes of coal a year
until the end of the century, but some rival bidders believe a figure in the
mid-30s would be optimistic.
Mr Reynolds values the business RJB hopes to buy at 'no more than Pounds
550m'.
RJB and Barclays de Zoete Wedd are thought to be planning to raise about
Pounds 400m through a share issue, including a public offer for sale. The
rest of the Pounds 1bn would be provided by bank debt.
The business plan is likely to suggest that most of the debt will be paid
back within three years and will point to strong cash flows from existing
contracts with the generators. The company will also hope to reduce the
offer price in detailed negotiations over the next few months. However, the
amount saved is likely to be tens of millions rather than hundreds.

FT  15 OCT 94 / City expresses anger over Eurotunnel revenue targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, which is due to announce its results for the first half of 1994
on Monday, was yesterday accused of taking a 'flippant' approach to its
investors only five months after making one of the largest rights issues in
UK history.
The casual way in which Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, revealed
last week that it would not meet its forecasts of revenue prompted anger and
unease in the City and led to a further fall in the company's share price.
The shares fell 17p to 228p, down 20p on the week.
The latest upset in Eurotunnel's frequently stormy relationship with the
City resulted from a remark by Mr Graham Corbett, chief financial officer,
that delays in the launch of tunnel rail services made it 'blindingly
obvious' that the company could not make its forecast for 1994 revenues of
Pounds 137m.
'The surprise is in the flippant way this has been released to the market,'
said one analyst. 'It was not blindingly obvious in May when they produced a
120-page rights issue document which had been vetted by their lawyers and
bankers.'
But Eurotunnel insisted yesterday that earlier press comment had concluded
that forecasts would not be met and that there was nothing new in Mr
Corbett's remarks.
Analysts estimated that the delays could reduce Eurotunnel's revenues by
between Pounds 30m and Pounds 50m. This, combined with the decline in the
company's share price may put the company in breach of its banking
covenants.
Eurotunnel calculated in May that it had a buffer of Pounds 419m in its
funding arrangements, including an assumption it would raise Pounds 200m
from the sale of its warrants.
The more cautious estimates of its bankers gave it a funding margin of only
Pounds 34m.
Eurotunnel denied that there was any danger of it breaking its bank
covenants. It was not due to start calling down its bank facilities until
next spring or summer at the earliest, it said.
The company's results statement will coincide with the announcement of the
starting date and fares of Eurostar services connecting London, Paris and
Brussels.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Blow to Balladur as trade minister resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The wave of French corruption scandals last night claimed its most prominent
victim with the resignation of Mr Gerard Longuet as trade and industry
minister.
His departure is a blow to the centre-right government of Prime Minister
Edouard Balladur. Mr Longuet was one of the most senior cabinet members and
regarded as a key ally in Mr Balladur's campaign to win the presidency next
year.
Mr Longuet's resignation follows that of Mr Alain Carignon, who stepped down
in July as communications minister to face corruption charges. Earlier this
week he was detained in a Lyon prison. A number of France's top businessmen
have been placed under investigation in a series of corruption cases.
Mr Longuet has been under increasing pressure to resign following charges of
illicit payments for the building of his holiday villa in St Tropez. He is
also one of the targets of a separate investigation into illegal corporate
funding of the centre-right Republican party.
Mr Longuet is the president of the Republican party, the second-largest
party in the ruling RPR Gaullist and centrist UDF coalition. Despite his
resignation, aides indicated that Mr Longuet would remain head of the
Republican party.
His departure will cause uncertainty over the course of French industrial
policy. Mr Longuet has pushed strongly for privatising the more profitable
parts of state-owned industry such as Renault, the car group and for
restructuring loss-makers like Bull, the computer company.
Government officials said no decision has been taken on Mr Longuet's
successor, but that it was possible that his sprawling industry dossier,
which includes trade, posts and telecommunications, might be split up. One
possible candidate for the industry post appears to be Mr Jean-Claude
Gaudin, a Republican senator.
Pressure for Mr Longuet's resignation has grown steadily since the leaking
of a judge's report to the justice ministry last month, accusing the
minister of corruption. The justice ministry, with Mr Balladur's backing,
granted Mr Longuet until the end of this month to clear himself of the
allegations before the filing of formal charges. This, in turn, brought the
prime minister under increasing criticism that he was sheltering a political
ally.
Mr Longuet's aides insist that he will succeed in disproving charges that he
allowed a friendly contractor to subsidise the building of his villa, but
that 'the desire for blood in this case' had made his position untenable.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: RJB Mining
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RJB Mining cannot be accused of lack of ambition. If the group's bid for the
bulk of British Coal is successful, it will have a turnover in excess of
Pounds 1bn, which is not bad for a company that did not even exist three
years ago. But the scale of RJB Mining's ambition is also a concern. The
group will need to raise about Pounds 1.1bn to cover working capital,
restoration and subsidence bonds, and the purchase itself. That is a lot of
money for a company with a market capitalisation of Pounds 157m. A
substantial share issue is needed as well as hefty borrowing. The question
is whether the group can pay back the banks and then provide a decent return
for shareholders. Competitors, whose bids were between 30 -50 per cent
lower, believe not.
Shareholders will be gambling that costs can be attacked more aggressively
than hitherto, and that RJB Mining's predictions for coal demand and prices
are not over-optimistic. The danger is that the group will not have paid
down debt by 1998 when the guaranteed contracts with the electricity
generators run out. If that happens, and the group's forecasts prove
unrealistic, the interest burden will leave little or no return for
shareholders.
For what it is worth, the government adviser NM Rothschild has given RJB
Mining's arithmetic its seal of approval. The UK's coal industry has a
promising future if it is sold at the right price. Investors will need to
study any prospectus with care.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the governor adamant that bond markets are too pessimistic about
inflation, the Bank of England was unlikely to opt for a long-dated auction
this month. Unusually, however, it had the luxury of choice, as gilts
continued to draw relative benefit from September's base rate rise.
Moreover, after this week's heavy tap sales, the Bank must feel comfortable
with its funding programme. Unlike last year it can well afford to forgo an
auction in November.
But the choice of a short maturity for October's auction leaves one problem
unresolved. This year's funding profile is not particularly tilted towards
the short end of the yield curve, but the Bank continues to eschew the
longest maturities of 25 years despite evident institutional demand. The
lack of such paper - the longest-dated conventional gilt matures in 2017 -
is a glaring gap in an otherwise richly-endowed market. The bank has yet to
find a way of filling it without giving the impression that it has turned
pessimistic about the course of rates.
The logic of the governor's approach is that rates will eventually fall as
investors become more trusting on inflation. But the chances of
substantially lower yields look slim in the short run. Worries persist about
the US bond market, and gilt spreads over US and German government bonds
have narrowed significantly over the past month. At around 100 and 130 basis
points respectively, they may not have much further to go.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The German stock market has risen by 7 per cent over the past week, and
yields on 10-year government bonds have dropped 3 basis points to below 7.5
per cent. This reflects growing confidence that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
coalition will be re-elected in tomorrow's general election.
If so, euphoria is likely to be short-lived as investors start to
concentrate once again on fundamentals. Earnings for Germany's bigger
companies are set to rise by around 80 per cent this year and 40 per cent in
1995, but this still leaves the market on a high valuation of 16 to 17 times
next year's earnings. As for bonds, an encouraging headline figure for
August M3 growth disguised an acceleration in bank lending, a red rag to the
Bundesbank bull. German industrial production is likely to pull back this
autumn after a blip this summer. The more robust the recovery, the less
Germany's unions will be prepared to settle for a moderate wage increase.
That is an environment in which the Bundesbank is likely to tighten interest
rates.
The complexity of Germany's voting system and the closeness of leading
parties in the opinion polls make it hard for investors to guess the
outcome. The least desirable development for the markets would be an
alliance between the leftwing SPD and the Green party, supported by the
former communist PDS party. Marginally more palatable would be a coalition
between the SPD and the rightwing CDU/CSU. Either result would unsettle the
markets next week. Thereafter it would serve to turn the spotlight more
acutely on the fundamentals.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Hamble pie
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NM Rothschild yesterday pinned the blame for the Aerostructures Hamble
debacle on the engineering company's management. Cock-ups by the management
there certainly were and those responsible should not profit from the sorry
affair. But the matter cannot be left at that. Given that the roots of the
company's problems go back to before the company was floated in June, there
is also a question of whether there were warning signs its advisers should
have spotted.
Mr Andy Barr, Aerostructures' chief executive, may have retired on
ill-health grounds. But he has still received Pounds 1.7m from selling
shares in the float. The honourable response would be to offer to buy back
shares from new investors at the price for which they were originally sold.
His son Mr Brian Barr, the company's manufacturing director at the time, has
been shifted to a new role. Since Aerostructures' problems were in its
factory, he can have no long-term future with the company. He too should use
the Pounds 580,000 he received from the float to buy back shares.
Rothschild and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Aerostructures' accountant, deny
negligence. And it would certainly be hard for shareholders to know whether
there was any without a much more detailed post mortem. But Rothschild,
Coopers and other advisers still have an interest in assuaging investors'
anger and so should consider paying back the Pounds 1.2m fees they earned
from sponsoring the float. There can certainly be no case for Coopers
continuing to receive fees for investigating what went wrong. If investors
are to be charged for the post mortem, it should at least be conducted by a
new team of advisers.

FT  15 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips up before release
of new figures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks improved yesterday in anticipation of next week's earnings
news, but a second round of benign inflation data failed to lift most share
prices, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 20.52 better at 3,910.47, mostly
on the strength of two stocks ' Alcoa and Union Carbide. The more broadly
based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 1.31 at 469.10.
On the NYSE, declining issues outnumbered advances by a margin of
11-to-seven in moderate activity. Some 251m shares were exchanged.
Other leading indices lost a little ground. The Nasdaq composite was 0.81
lower at 767.08, while the American SE composite dipped 0.07 to 458.50.
Stocks essentially picked up where they had left off on Thursday, when
morning gains were erased during the late afternoon. Yesterday the early
selling suggested that the markets would have difficulty breaking through
technical resistance after the powerful rally which commenced at the end of
last week.
The day's economic news filled in a few more details in the more positive
outlook which began to take shape last Friday. The Labor Department said
that consumer prices had risen 0.2 per cent in September, as forecast. The
Federal Reserve announced that industrial production had stagnated last
month, while capacity utilisation - an important indication of future
inflation - had slipped from the previous month's level.
Bonds, which were strong all week, managed a modest gain on the data. But
stocks appeared to have run out of steam, too, as some investors booked
profits on the recent advance.
The Dow industrials were lifted late in the session by anticipation of
strong earnings news from Alcoa, up Dollars 3 5/8 at Dollars 87. Union
Carbide gained Dollars 1 to Dollars 33 3/4 and Kodak lost Dollars 2 to
Dollars 49 1/2. Both companies are expected to release their results next
week.
In semiconductors, Texas Instruments forged Dollars 1 1/4 ahead to Dollars
68 5/8 after posting third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.94 cents a share, a
little better than analysts had forecast and well ahead of last year's
result. Rubbermaid, the household products company, also posted improved
sales and profits but its stock shed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 25 7/8.
There were a few developments unrelated to earnings which were stirring up
stocks.
Long Island Lighting jumped Dollars 1 1/8 , or nearly 7 per cent, to Dollars
17 5/8 after Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York, proposed that the state
government purchase the utility. A deal would be expected to value the
company at Dollars 21.50 a share, but the stock was trading lower than that
level because Mr Cuomo faces a fierce challenge in his bid for re-election
next month.
In pharmaceuticals, McKesson dropped Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 96 1/2 after
Eli Lilly extended the waiting period on its tender offer for the company's
PCS Health Systems division. The acquisition is under close scrutiny by the
Federal Trade Commission. Lilly was off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 58 3/4.
On the Nasdaq, shares in Intuit surged Dollars 17 1/8 to Dollars 67 3/8 .
The 34 per cent gain came on news that the financial software developer had
agreed to be acquired by Microsoft, down Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 15/16.
Canada
Toronto ended the week on a quiet note, down slightly in light trading
yesterday but up overall on the week.
The TSE 300 composite index was down 10.95 points, or 0.25 per cent, to
4,332.42, with losers ahead of winners by 404 to 307. Volume of 47.63m
shares and value of CDollars 553.7m were down sharply from the previous
day's 71.06m shares and CDollars 923.7m. The TSE composite 300 index was up
about 42 points on the week.
Overall, 10 of the 14 sub-indexes were down, led by real estate, golds,
paper and forestry and oil and gas stocks.

FT  15 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa closes firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Johannesburg's equity market finished mostly firmer on follow-through
support after Thursday's rally and renewed interest following recent losses;
but gold shares remained depressed by a soft bullion price, and interest in
the sector was limited.
Industrials continued to lead the way, the sector index rising 31 to 6,355
after Thursday's 62-point gain. Sappi, the papermaker, exemplified the
trend, rising R1 to R63 after a R5 jump the day before, as Monday's Dollars
1.6bn acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in SD Warren of the US continued to
support the stock.
The gold index slipped 13 to 2,288, brought down by bullion's continued
uncertainty around current levels. Vaal Reefs fell R9 to R429, and Loraine
50 cents to R21.75.
The overall index rose 15 to 5,627. Dealers said that further short-term
gains would depend on Wall Street extending its uptrend, and that
medium-term prospects remained dominated by currency and bullion concerns.

records fifth consecutive high

<TEXT>
Heavy selling by banks depressed share prices and the Nikkei index,
declining for the first time in five trading days, fell below the 20,000
level to which it had recovered on Wednesday, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-share average retreated 179.54 to 19,969.29 after opening at a high
of 20,107.12 and hitting a low of 19,964.49 in the afternoon session.
Selling linked to yesterday's options settlements and profit-taking by banks
depressed share prices, while foreign investors continued to buy chemicals
and steel issues.
Volume totalled 397m shares against 353m, some 80m shares of the total
accounted for by options settlements-related trading. The Topix index of all
first section stocks fell 13.08 to 1,593.08 and the Nikkei 300 index fell
2.91 to 291.27. Losers led gainers by 675 to 334, with 156 issues remaining
unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.77 to 1308.11.
Steels were firm on buying by overseas investors. Sumitomo Metal Industries,
the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y356, while Nippon Steel fell
Y7 to Y388. Foreigners also supported chemical stocks, with Mitsubishi
Chemical up Y7 to Y583. 'People are betting on the rise in demand of steel
and petrochemical products in south-east Asia and China,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki
at Nikko Securities.
Banks were weak on profit-taking by companies. Industrial Bank of Japan fell
Y70 to Y3,000 and Sumitomo Bank declined Y60 to Y1,840.
The rise of the yen to the Y98 level hit high-technology stocks. NEC fell
Y10 to Y1,260 and Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y20 to Y1,670.
Japan Telecom fell Y10,000 to Y3.9m but Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose
Y3,000 to Y886,000, advancing for the fourth straight day.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 83.07 to 22,348.62 in volume of 19.7m shares.
Roundup
The region was supported by overnight gains on Wall Street.
Nomura, once again, in-creased its asset allocation to south-east Asia; it
did so at the expense of the US, with Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia
and Malaysia each attracting an additional 1 percentage point weighting in
its global portfolio.
The Indonesian parliament yesterday approved a 5 per cent reduction in
corporate and personal tax rates. Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia commented
that this was positive for the market in terms of both earnings growth and
sentiment: 'Put in a regional context, the new tax rate - of 30 per cent
effective from January 1 1995 - will make Indonesia even more attractive
compared with its rivals.'
SEOUL finished at a fifth consecutive record high after further selling by
the state-run stock market stabilisation fund failed to stop a buying spree.
The composite index picked up another 6.83 to 1,103.37, taking the week's
gains to 3.6 per cent. The index also posted a new record high of 1,108.08
during the morning. Volume totalled 58.2m shares, up from Thursday's 53.8m.
HONG KONG finished firm, but well off the day's highs as investors were
quick to take profits after an early rally. The Hang Seng index added 18.58
to 9,550.93, having been 128 points ahead in early trade, for a rise over
the week of 2.9 per cent.
HSBC Holdings was the lone bright spot carrying the index ahead. The stock
gained HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 91 mainly on overseas buying. 'If it
weren't for HSBC, the market would have fared rather worse,' said Mr Howard
Gorges at South China Brokerage.
Taking HSBC's lead, Bank of East Asia added 50 cents to HKDollars 33.30 and
Wing Lung Bank rose 50 cents to HKDollars 54.50.
Hong Kong Telecom slipped 10 cents to HKDollars 16.50 after news late on
Wednesday that it was prepared to invest HKDollars 2bn in China's mobile and
fixed phone networks.
SINGAPORE was higher on fresh demand from institutional funds and the
Straits Times Industrials index rose 19.48 to 2,377.30, for a 2.0 per cent
rise on the week.
QAF, which makes Gardenia bread, rose 10 cents to SDollars 1.62 amid rumours
that a British company was planning to buy a stake at SDollars 2.50 a share.
BANGKOK put on 1.6 per cent on an afternoon rally on reports that one of the
parties forming the governing coalition had resolved a dispute over proposed
nominations for senior ministerial posts.
The SET index rose 23.49 to 1,498.55, for a week's gain of 2.7 per cent, in
heavy turnover of Bt9.7bn.
Shinawatra Computer ad-vanced Bt16 to Bt760 and its subsidiary Advanced Info
by Bt20 to Bt450 on expectations the group's founder might be nominated as
foreign minister.
The banking sector saw some of the biggest gains, with the sub-index
improving 3.1 per cent. Krung Thai Bank rose Bt3.50 to Bt82 with 19.8m
shares changing hands, while Bangkok Bank put on Bt6 to Bt218 and Thai
Farmers Bank Bt4 to Bt174.
SYDNEY was motivated by Wall Street's good overnight gains, as well as by a
strong rise in the gold sector. The All Ordinaries index added 7.1 to
2,006.0, up 2 per cent on the week.
The gold index put on 34.1 to 2,327.3, bolstered by a 14 per cent rise in
Plutonic Resources, the shares rising to a four-month high of ADollars 6.83.
Plutonic reported that it had doubled its reserves at its deposits in
Western Aus-tralia.
Brokers said that investors, generally, remained nervous ahead of the
release of inflation data next week.
In the mining sector, CRA added 24 cents to ADollars 18.90, with MIM steady
at ADollars 2.73 and WMC off 1 cent at ADollars 7.99.
SHANGHAI's A share index bounced 4.7 per cent higher but was still 7.8 per
cent lower over the course of a volatile week.
The index picked up 30.53 to 678.08, having picked up from a day's low of
602.58.
Blue chip Pudong issues led the recovery, with Pudong Qiangshen Taxi rising
8.9 per cent to Yn15.68.
The Shenzhen A index recovered 4.77, or 3.1 per cent, to 158.03.
JAKARTA was little moved by the change in the corporate tax rate, with the
official index up 3.16 at 510.34.
COLOMBO retreated slightly in the absence of foreign investors. The all
share index shed 5.45 to 1,111.05 in turnover down to SLRs43.8m from
SLRs49.2m. 16 million.
MANILA ended slightly higher after a session of volatile trading. The
composite index, which broke through the 3,000 level on a couple of
occasions, settled at 2,999.93, up 9.18 on the day and little changed on the
week.
Property-related issues and selected second liners led the session as
investors took positions in companies scheduled to release third-quarter
results in the next few days.
Turnover was 2.04bn pesos.

FT  15 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris down as French analysts
revise forecasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's batch of US economic statistics did little to influence bourses;
performance seemed to benefit from the public going to the polls, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS took profits ahead of the weekend, after four days of impressive
gains, and the CAC-40 index shed 22.66 or 1.2 per cent to 1,933.02. The
weakness of the US dollar later in the day also had an impact on performance
during the afternoon but, in spite of yesterday's descent, the market
managed a 4 per cent gain on the week.
According to a survey of 16 French equity research organisations, analysts
recently moved to revise their forecasts for 1995 company earnings.
Forecasts have been revised down for 24 of the companies in the CAC-40
index, with 12 being revised up and four unchanged.
Alcatel-Alsthom, one of the market's largest stocks in terms of market
capitalisation, was trimmed back heavily following its poor interim results
at the end of last month. The consensus forecast was for 1995 earnings per
share of FFr46.30 compared with a previous estimate of FFr53.60 and the
shares closed down FFr3.70 yesterday at FFr474.30.
Eurotunnel, which is not a CAC-40 constituent, again featured as one of the
session's worst performers as investors took the view that first-half
results due out on Monday would be disappointing.
The shares lost 7.5 per cent, or FFr1.55 to FFr19.00, bringing their loss
since last Friday to 9.5 per cent. Analysts said that they would not be
surprised if the group had to make a further cash call on banks and
shareholders early in the new year.
FRANKFURT tried to curb its enthusiasm but the market expectation that the
ruling conservative/liberal coalition would secure a 20 or 30 seats'
majority in tomorrow's general elections, combined with yesterday
afternoon's neutral batch of US economic data, let its underlying
bullishness rise to the surface at the end of the day.
The session rise of 23.10 to 2,105.73, leaving the Dax index up 7.4 per cent
on the week, did not quite incorporate Thursday's post-bourse gains and, for
a while, it looked as if German equities would go no higher until the
election was decided. Turnover fell from DM8bn to DM6.4bn.
However, it was impossible to restrain Allianz, the insurer, a proxy for the
German market and a beta stock, in that it tends to outperform on the
downgrade, and on the upgrade: yesterday it rose another DM34 to DM2,397
after hours, helping the Ibis-indicated Dax climb to 2,118.52 by the end of
the afternoon.
ZURICH was easier on profit-taking after recent gains. The SMI index
declined 8.0 to 2,585.3, but was still 3.6 per cent ahead over the week.
Activity continued to centre on the banking sector. UBS bearers picked up
another SFr26 to SFr1,258, with the bank again a buyer of its own stock, as
the battle with BK Vision over a new share structure continued. UBS
registered picked up SFr6 to SFr310, with BK Bank, which controls BK Vision,
said to be an active buyer.
Among the insurers, Winterthur declined SFr20 to SFr630 and Zurich Insurance
shed SFr15 to SFr1,190.
In pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates declined SFr40 to SFr5,900 ahead of
Monday's release of nine-month sales figures, forecast to rise between 3 and
5 per cent in Swiss franc terms and around 8 to 10 per cent in local
currencies.
AMSTERDAM made a modest gain following the US data, although a weakening
dollar later in the afternoon pulled a number of currency-sensitive stocks
lower. The AEX index rose 0.85 to 408.16 for a week's rise of 3.7 per cent.
Oce-van der Grinten, the photocopier manufacturer, initially dipped on
profit-taking following the publication of third-quarter profits which
showed a gain of 40 per cent, at the top end of analysts' expectations. But
after touching a session low of Fl 74.30, the shares recovered to close
unchanged at Fl 76.50.
MILAN saw a quiet end to the October account, with many banks closed by the
day's general strike. The Comit index registered a rise of 4.22 to 634.54,
up 0.7 per cent over the week, but the real time Mibtel index lost 101 on
the day to 10,119.
Telecom Italia, which said it was seeking a co-operation accord with a
foreign telecommunications operator within the next few months, lost L76 to
L4,149.
MADRID saw weakness in domestic bonds where the December future was off 48
basis points at 88.05 by late afternoon. The general index fell 1.68 to
301.50, leaving it 3.4 per cent ahead on the week.
One of the day's best performers was Cortefiel, Spain's second largest
specialist clothing retailer, which unveiled plans to expand in Germany
yesterday, and which has been courting analysts in recent days. The shares
rose Pta230, or 5.9 per cent to Pta4,130.
HELSINKI rose ahead of Sunday's advisory referendum on Finland's EU
membership, the Hex index putting on 48.4, or 2.5 per cent at 1,961.3, up
7.1 per cent on the week.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stock index futures turned tail yesterday, reversing an uptrend which had
extended for six straight days, writes Jeffrey Brown.
At the official 4:10pm close, the FT-SE 100 December contract was 47 points
lower at 3,122 with most of the decline concentrated in the final two hours
of trading.
Trading volume was lighter than on Thursday - at 13,834 contracts, against
16,146.
Traded option business also diminished, falling back to 34,231 lots from
58,674 in the previous session. FT-SE trading accounted for 14,085 lots.

FT  15 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: P &amp; O prosper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
P &amp; 0 stood out like a beacon in an otherwise dull market, surging 15 to
638p as investors continued to keep the shares firmly on the recovery tack.
Interest-rate-sensitive, with a debt ratio (to net worth) of around 60 per
cent compared to a Footsie average closer to 30 per cent, P &amp; 0 is being
widely seen as a clear beneficiary of the Bank of England's recent less
hawkish tone on base rates.
The uncertainties surrounding British Gas's dividend policy, which surfaced
after a lunch between the company and a number of energy analysts mid-week,
brought renewed pressure to bear on Gas shares which retreated 7 1/2 to
296p. Turnover reached 8.9m shares.
A UBS buy recommendation helped sustain Shell which eventually settled a net
8 off at 727p, having been much lower earlier in the session. BP held up
well and closed fractionally easier at 422 1/2 p as Kleinwort Benson
upgraded its stance on the stock to 'long-term buy', citing a strong
recovery in European polyethylene margins.
Kleinwort also noted rumours of a 'giant condensate find west of Shetlands'
as underlining the group's upstream strength.
VSEL, the subject of an agreed takeover from British Aerospace, edged
forward 5 to 1,325p with BAe also hardening a tad to 470p, up 3. GEC, which
has declared itself to be a potential counter-bidder, slipped 7 to 293p as
market hopes for a full-scale auction showed signs of flagging.
NatWest Securities has upgraded expectations for profits at BAe, should its
Pounds 478m offer succeed. The house feels that, combined with VSEL,
normalised profits at BAe could improve to Pounds 311m in 1985, up from an
earlier estimate of Pounds 240m.
A big individual trade in Barclays Bank helped drive the shares sharply
higher early in the session, but they subsequently succumbed to the general
retreat by the market, closing 7 off at 566p. Heavy turnover of 12m shares,
the highest for two months, reflected an institutional buyer of 4.5m shares
at 583p.
Anagen, the diagnostics group, raced up 7 to 59p after a bullish note in the
press and ahead of what are expected to be good interim results next
Thursday.
In the leaders Glaxo delivered one of the outstanding performances in the
FT-SE 100, the shares moving up strongly to close 6 better at 612p as
domestic and overseas institutions bought the stock aggressively on the view
that it was substantially oversold and a strong chart buy.
Turnover in Glaxo topped 8m, the highest since the group revealed its
preliminary figures last month.
Ahead of Monday's interim statement, Eurotunnel re-mained a weak market,
sliding a further 17 to 228p for a two-day decline of 35. To a man, analysts
expect the group to project a significant shortfall on revenue targets for
this year: some even talk of the company seeking yet another cash injection.
Shares in Body Shop, which reported improved interim profits earlier in the
week, firmed 2 to 227p, as the market continued to celebrate the figures.
Several brokers recommended the stock, including NatWest Securities which
said: 'We expect 15 to 20 per cent growth per annum from this increasingly
global retailer.'
Speculation that the much discussed sale of Boot's drugs division was
imminent sent the shares forward to close 4 better at 535p, after trade of
3.7m. SG Warburg was said to be positive on Dixons and the shares closed up
7 1/2 at 201 1/2 p.
Insurance and tobacco group BAT outperformed the poor market trend with the
shares finishing 2 lighter at 455p, in strong volume of 9.6m, after a James
Capel recommendation.
The broker reiterated its buy stance on the stock, saying future dividend
payments are likely to be in excess of inflation. 'We also expect a strong
set of third-quarter figures next month following a recovery in the US
cigarette market,' said an analyst.

FT  15 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Engineers fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The engineering sector suffered two sharp body blows yesterday in the shape
of profits warnings from Senior Engineering and Aerostructures Hamble, which
sliced Pounds 125m off the combined market value of the two companies.
Senior was the most actively traded share of the day, tumbling 34 to 72p in
a turnover of 12m as the company announced that a combination of order
shortfall and cost overruns would lead to a big drop in profits for 1994.
Securities houses were quick to downgrade earnings estimates with BZW coming
down Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m and Smith New Court shading by a similar
amount to Pounds 18.5m. These leave the dividend nicely covered but
analysts' hopes of a 10 per cent increase are fading rapidly.
With six-month profits down more than a third, no interim dividend and the
resignation of its chief executive, Aerostructures put in a near cataclysmic
performance, sliding 35 to 24p with 2.2m shares traded.
The company, which made its stock market debut in June at 120p, warned last
month that all was not well. Affected by problems on Harrier component
contracts, it expects 1995 sales will be hard hit.

FT  15 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Worries hit life insurers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Life assurance companies were given a drubbing by marketmakers anxious to
head off any attempted large selling of the sector ahead of a Securities and
Investments Board report on pensions selling, expected later this month.
Stories circulating in the market suggested that compensation to
policyholders could amount to Pounds 2bn, well ahead of previous estimates
of Pounds 500m.
Life assurance specialists pointed out that it would be the unit-linked
companies which would be affected by the increased compensation news. These
include Lloyd Abbey Life, whose shares dropped to 334p before settling a net
10 off at 338p, and Allied Dunbar, a subsidiary of Bats.
Prudential were 12 lower at 307p. Legal &amp; General, whose shares were lifted
recently by vague takeover stories, dipped 11 to 451p and London &amp;
Manchester lost 5 to 336p.

FT  15 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dollar weakness hits blue chips at
the close - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Currency factors yesterday tripped up a UK stock market which had taken in
its stride the widely-heralded US data on consumer prices, retail sales and
industrial production. Wall Street made little response to the economic
statistics which were seen as largely neutral and likely to reduce the
chances of an early tightening in Federal Reserve policy.
A more potent factor at the London close was the weakness in the dollar as
the DM advanced ahead of this weekend's elections in Germany. Dollar
weakness hit a range of international blue chip stocks in London and the
early loss in the FT-SE 100 Share Index was quickly extended.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 35.2 points down at 3,106.7, having
barely held above 3,104 earlier. Trading volumes were very slow at first but
picked up in the second half of the session when a UK investment bank
appeared to be operating a sell programme across the range of equities.
The final total of 575.2m shares through the Seaq electronic network
compared with 816.9m in the previous session. Non-Footsie business made up
around 54 per cent of the day's total, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index shed 13.2
to 3,543.4 as profits were taken.
While disappointed to see the market's six-day run of gains in the Footsie
ended, and also to see the Footsie 3,100 mark challenged again so soon,
analysts were prepared to see yesterday's setback as no more than an
expected bout of profit-taking.
The market has risen by 108 Footsie points, or around 3.6 per cent, this
week as the mood has turned more optimistic on global and domestic interest
rate and inflation prospects.
Keen support has come from global bond markets as economic data from the US
has suggested that need for an early tightening by the Federal Reserve is
weakening. However, the Fed's Open Market Committee will meet at the
beginning of next month and this provides a further opening for the Fed to
act if it wishes.
British government bonds had a quiet session yesterday and closed with small
losses which ranged to around  5/32 at the short end of the range and
slightly less at the longer end. The bond market took its cue from Wall
Street's satisfaction with the US economic statistics.
As expected the Bank of England announced that on October 26 it would
auction bonds with maturities ranging from 1998 to 2002. Further details
will be announced on Tuesday and when issued dealings start on the same day.
The bank also announced that there would be no gilt-edged auction next month
in view of the Budget to be introduced by the UK chancellor of the
exchequer. Earlier, demand for bonds exhausted two of the issues taken into
the market this week.
Among the international stocks, Glaxo provided a lone firm spot at the
close. The rest of the dollar-earning sector showed a list of mostly small
losses, with the leading oil shares just a shade easier as the market took
the view that the crisis on the Kuwaiti border appears to be easing.
Consumer and retail issues gave back some of their recent gains in spite of
the general view that this week's news of a further dip in domestic
inflation has made it unlikely that base rates will be raised again this
year.
The market faces further tests of confidence next week in Europe and the US.
The outcome of the German elections is likely to have further effect on
currencies and the latest statistics on German M3 money supply is due at the
end of the week. At home, the market will focus on the UK Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement estimates, expected on Tuesday. Forecasts are for a
sharp increase, perhaps to around Pounds 4.8bn, according to some analysts.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar woes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar yesterday sunk to within reach of its 1994 low against the D-Mark
as bearish sentiment continued to dog the US currency, writes Philip Gawith.
No clear message emerged from the trifecta of important data released -
retail sales, consumer inflation and capacity utilisation - but short term
traders still sold the dollar.
In London it touched a low of DM1.5175 - compared to a low for the year of
DM1.5165 on July 12 - before closing at DM1.5201 from DM1.5423. Against the
yen, it finished at Y98.285 from Y99.91
Elsewhere the D-Mark was stronger, helped by the weaker dollar and the
expectation that Chancellor Kohl will triumph in Sunday's national election.
It finished at L1,020 against the lira, from L1,016, and at FFr3.428, from
FFr3.424, against the French franc.
Sterling was a victim of the stronger D-Mark, slipping more than 1 1/2
pfennigs to a close of DM2.4207 from DM2.4386.
Analysts remain pessimistic about the dollar's prospects. Mr Neil MacKinnon,
chief economist at Citibank in London, noted that the dollar was also close
to lows against the Swiss franc, and this was often a useful leading
indicator for the dollar against the D-Mark.
'If it can't go up against the Swiss franc, it certainly isn't going to go
up against the D-Mark,' said Mr MacKinnon.
He cautioned, however, against reading too much into the movement. 'Volumes
are thin and the price action continues to be dominated by shorter term
players. The fund managers continue to stand on the sidelines. They are
unwilling net sellers of the dollar against the D-Mark.'
Mr MacKinnon said the market remained broadly neutral on the dollar against
the D-Mark. 'There is no indication that fund managers are going short of
the dollar yet.' He said that with late German opinion polls showing the
election promised to be a close affair, 'D-Mark bullishness may have to be
curbed.'
He said the dollar was probably at the bottom end of its recent DM1.52/1.58
trading range, rather than about to touch new lows.
Mr MacKinnon was less sanguine about the outlook for the dollar against the
yen. He said there were a number of prominent investors with 'very large'
long dollar positions against the yen. If the yen continues to rise, forcing
these positions to be liquidated to cut losses, the dollar's fall will only
be accelerated.
Citibank is holding by its view of further yen appreciation - to Y95 over
three months, and Y90 in a year.
The futures markets lost some of their recent momentum, with the December
short sterling contract closing at 93.59, from 93.62.
The top discount rate at the weekly tender of 91-day treasury bills fell to
5.4349 per cent, from 5.4951 per cent. Analysts said this reflected the
market's increasing conviction that UK interest rates might not rise again
this year.
The Bank of England yesterday cleared a Pounds 1.1bn shortage in UK money
markets, at established rates, with Pounds 1.112bn of assistance.
Some leading German banks will open tomorrow afternoon to provide clients
with a service from the time the first election results emerge. A victory
for Chancellor Kohl is heavily discounted in the market, though opinion
polls show the result is likely to be close.
The Finnish markka was steady, trading at around FM3.09 against the D-Mark
ahead of Sunday's referendum on EU membership. A 'yes' vote is expected.

Prices started to decline and buyers withdrew from the market, but we
consider quite a normal development and there are indications that prices
are stabilising already. Offers from origins remained limited to a small
number of profit-takers only. Black faq spot Europe traded yesterday at
USDollars 2,550 a tonne and in the US Market the ASTA grade was at 1.30

FT  15 OCT 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Aluminium price hits
4-year high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bullish charts and fundamentals, together with a quickening in the rate of
depletion of London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks, yesterday combined to
drive aluminium prices to four-year highs.
The three months delivery position at the LME closed at Dollars 1,707.75 a
tonne, up Dollars 36.25 on the day and Dollars 56.50 on the week.
Traders told the Reuters news agency that rising physical demand for
aluminium world-wide could mean that stocks of the metal would fall faster
than had been expected. This view was supported yesterday morning when the
LME revealed that stocks of aluminium in its warehouses had fallen by
another 55,150 tonnes to 2,190,500 tonnes. That followed the announcement on
Tuesday of a 22,150-tonnes fall and took the draw-down from the mid-June
record to about 460,000 tonnes.
Aluminium's strength stiffened the sinews of other LME contracts, most of
which had drifted lower early in the day. Three months copper, after
initially being helped up to Dollars 2,494 a tonne by merchant buying, sank
back to test support at Dollars 2,480, where it held, closing Dollars 8 down
on the day at Dollars 2,481.50 to show a total loss on the week of Dollars
53.50.
The gold price resumed its slide at the start of the week but steadied a
little later. It ended little changed yesterday after eagerly awaited US
inflation data failed to give a lead in either direction. The closing level
was Dollars 387.60 a troy ounce, down Dollars 5.10 on the week but Dollars
2.10 above the six-week low touched on Tuesday.
After a week of erratic trading, in which the market was highly sensitive to
any reports of rain in Brazilian growing areas, London Commodity Exchange
coffee futures finished on a down-swing. The January position fell Dollars
93 yesterday to Dollars 3,505 a tonne, down Dollars 18 on the week but
Dollars 155 above Wednesday's low.
The US-based Weather Services Corporation said light showers were possible
yesterday in the coffee-growing states of Parana and Sao Paulo, Reuters
reported. Otherwise it thought that the hot, dry weather that has been
discouraging selling on the futures market would continue.
At the International Petroleum Exchange this week all eyes were focussed on
the Iraq-Kuwait border, although dealers were in some doubt about what the
market response should be in the event of an attempted invasion. An Iraqi
defeat resulting in a change of regime, it was suggested, could lead to an
early end to sanctions and might therefore be bearish for the oil market;
while a withdrawal might prolong Saddam Hussein's regime and leave the
return of Iraqi oil exports a remoter prospect than before.
In the end the market seems to have decided that peace was bearish. The
IPE's December contract, which had spiked to Dollars 17.33 a barrel on
Monday, sank below Dollars 16 as tension eased.
Efforts to wrap up a new world rubber pact failed after 10 days of
UN-sponsored meetings here, the final assembly was told yesterday, reports
Reuters from Geneva.
Chairman Peter Lai said more negotiations were planned for Geneva starting
February 6, 1995, provided all parties and the UN Conference on Trade and
Development agreed to hold the third round.
The existing 1987 agreement, due to expire on December 31, was likely to be
extended by another year at a council meeting of the International Natural
Rubber Organisation on November 28-December 2 in Kuala Lumpur, Mr Lai said.

FT  15 OCT 94 / International Company News: Microsoft buys into the personal
finance revolution - The acquisition of Quicken gives the PC industry leader
dominance in a key area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Microsoft's planned Dollars 1.5bn acquisition of Intuit, publisher of
Quicken, the leading personal finance program, reflects its determination to
dominate the emerging market for on-line electronic commerce.
'The opportunity is incredible,' said Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, who
has been pouring resources into the development of ways to profit from the
coming 'information superhighways'. He says personal electronic transactions
 -for example, paying bills and shopping from home - will continue to grow
with the proliferation of home computers. 'Managing finances is a
pre-eminent application that the electronic world will advance. Microsoft
wants to be there.'
Microsoft has agreed to exchange 1.336 shares of Microsoft stock for each
share of Intuit, with a provision that the ratio will be adjusted to
maintain a floor value of Dollars 71 a share should the value of Microsoft's
shares decline.
The deal - the largest acquisition in the history of the software industry -
also demonstrates the ability of Microsoft to bolster its market leadership
through acquisitions when its own products fail. 'This is a case of 'if you
can't beat 'em buy 'em',' said Mr David Coursey, publisher of PC Letter, a
computer industry newsletter.
With fiscal 1994 sales of Dollars 4.65bn and net income of Dollars 1.15bn,
Microsoft is by far the world's largest and most profitable software
company. Intuit reported sales of Dollars 223m for the fiscal year ending in
July, with net losses of Dollars 173.2m after merger-related charges.
Excluding charges, Intuit earned Dollars 25.4m. (The company changed its
fiscal year following the acquisition in December of ChipSoft, a publisher
of tax preparation software.)
Personal finance is one of the few segments of the PC software market that
Microsoft has failed to dominate. Intuit's Quicken is used by about 6m PC
owners, or 75 per cent of all 'active personal finance users', according to
an Intuit survey. Microsoft's competing 'Money' program has captured only a
tiny share of the market since its introduction two years ago.
'For nearly 10 years, Intuit has been the industry's shining example of how
a small, well-run company with great products could beat Microsoft at its
own game,' said Mr Coursey. The sale of Intuit 'is a good deal for its
shareholders, but a sad day for independent software companies', he says.
The acquisition will roughly double Microsoft's sales of software
specifically designed for home computer users. It also gives it an immediate
entry into the emerging market for home banking.
Through partnerships with Visa International and Checkfree, Intuit has
established direct on-line links with financial institutions and a system to
allow individuals to pay bills electronically.
In addition to its home-banking arrangements, Intuit offers on-line updates
of mutual funds' performance and other financial data to the users of its
software. Intuit also recently acquired the National Payment Clearing House,
an electronic bill-paying service, which had been processing payments for
users of Microsoft Money.
Microsoft had been planning similar ties with banks and financial
information sources in preparation for the launch of its own computer
on-line service, code-named Marvel, next year. Electronic banking is now
likely to become a key part of Marvel. The service has not been formally
announced by Microsoft, but is expected to be part of the company's 'Windows
95' operating system program, due out next year.
'Our mission has been to lead the digital revolution in the financial
services sector,' said Mr Scott Cook, Intuit's chairman and co-founder. The
decision to sell his company to Microsoft was a 'trade-off', he said,
'between being a big fish in your carp pond and independence versus the
opportunity to change the world in terms of the way people manage their
financial lives'. As an independent company, Intuit lacked the resources to
fully exploit opportunities to sell its products internationally and develop
new products, Mr Cook said. It also lacked the clout to negotiate deals with
large banks to expand its home banking services.
When the deal is consummated, Mr Cook will become an executive
vice-president of Microsoft, in charge of a new 'electronic commerce'
product division, based at Intuit's headquarters in Menlo Park, California.
The acquisition agreement has been approved by the directors of both
companies, but may be subject to regulatory review. This could be more than
a formality for Microsoft, which recently signed to an anti-trust consent
decree following a US Justice Department investigation. In a move to avoid
potential anti-trust problems, Microsoft said that it would sell its
personal finance management program to Novell.
Terms of the transaction with Novell were not revealed. Mr Gates said the
sale price 'will not be material'.
Yesterday, Intuit's shares soared on news of the acquisition plans, to close
at Dollars 67 3/8 after reaching Dollars 73 1/4. This is well up on
Wednesday's Dollars 50 1/4 when trading was suspended pending announcement
of the deal. Microsoft's share price was down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 55
15/16.

FT  15 OCT 94 / International Company News: Investors reject Japan Tobacco
in partial float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Two thirds of the Japan Tobacco shares allocated in a partial privatisation
of the monopoly cigarette company have been rejected by investors, further
embarrassing the ministry of finance as it struggles to find the right
formula for pricing equity offerings.
Ministry officials said subscriptions to 284,037 shares, or 66.2 per cent of
the 429,339 on offer to retail investors, were cancelled following a lottery
for the right to subscribe. A second subscription round is now to be
offered.
The ministry runs the risk of falling up to Y408bn (Dollars 4.1bn) short of
the Y958bn it had hoped to raise from the share issue. It is offering a
total of 666,666 shares to individuals and institutions, representing a
one-third stake in the company.
At the issue price of Y1.438m per share, Japan Tobacco is valued at
Y2,876bn. Trading in the shares is due to start on October 27.
During the past two weeks, it became apparent that the issue was likely to
run into trouble.
The snub from investors has put the ministry under fire for the way it has
managed initial public offerings. Last year's listing of East Japan Railway
triggered a 20 per cent fall in the Tokyo stock market as mass sell orders
depressed the stock, while Japan Telecom, the most recent public offering,
has been trading 17 per cent below its IPO price.
Payment for the second round of Japan Tobacco subscriptions is due on
October 20, but brokers expect many of the stocks to remain unsold. Although
the ministry's initial plan was to offer the unsold stock on the market on
the day of the listing, it is now unlikely to do so for fear of further
disruption to the stock market.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, finance minister, yesterday tried to avert criticism
by insisting that Japan Tobacco would be listed as scheduled on October 27.
However, The ministry, which still owns a two-third stake in NTT, Japan's
largest telecommunications company, is likely to postpone the planned sale
of 500,000 shares in that company. The ministry had hoped to raise Y340bn.

FT  15 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kidder sale talks intensify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PaineWebber, the US securities house, was locked in talks yesterday on the
acquisition of most of the business of Kidder Peabody, the troubled
investment banking arm of General Electric.
The talks have intensified since last week, when the two were discussing
only the sale of Kidder's retail broking business. If completed, a deal
could lead to GE exchanging its equity interest in Kidder for a stake of
around 25 per cent in PaineWebber, worth Dollars 275m at yesterday's market
price.
GE executives sent in to run Kidder earlier this year have maintained they
did not set out to sell the bank, though they have not rejected approaches
made to them. Two years ago, GE came close to selling the bank to Primerica,
the financial services group since renamed Travelers.
Kidder has been widely viewed as unsaleable on Wall Street in recent months.
It was rocked by the disclosure of what it alleges was a scheme to create
Dollars 350m of fictitious profits, while the downturn in bond prices this
year revealed the bank's over-reliance for its earnings on one corner of the
financial markets, the market for mortgage-backed bonds.
However, nine days ago, Kidder's bosses announced a plan to shrink the bank
and shift its most illiquid and difficult-to-value securities to another GE
subsidiary, a move widely seen as a prelude to a sale.
According to a source close to the talks, a purchase would strengthen
PaineWebber's business on a number of fronts. It would bring it Kidder's
1,250-strong retail broking salesforce; the fund management business and
investment banking operations are also said to interest PaineWebber.
While Kidder leads Wall Street in the business of underwriting
mortgage-backed bonds, neither bank has a strong presence as an underwriter
of equity or corporate debt. By combining broking salesforces and
underwriting operations, the two could become a more powerful force.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Wembley Trail: Wolfson's tactics may still secure the
trophy - Impending rescue package / As moves towards refinancing Wembley
approach a climax, Tim Burt reports on the likely outcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From the police control room at Wembley, every approach and movement around
the stadium can be monitored on a bank of TV screens. Inside the famous twin
tower complex, high-powered cameras can pick out individual supporters.
In recent weeks, directors and bankers of the debt-burdened stadium and
leisure company have been scrutinising rival refinancing groups in an
equally rigorous fashion, ahead of a final decision later this month.
Although Wembley is only a small player on the UK corporate field, its run
of poor form has attracted interest out of all proportion to its size. Most
companies with debts exceeding Pounds 100m and a market value of Pounds 20m
would be regarded as terminally ill, not long for this world. Not so
Wembley.
Such is the crowd appeal of Britain's self-proclaimed 'Venue of Legends',
that it has received three firm refinancing proposals, while informal rescue
offers have also been touted by other teams.
Moves to revive the company began in earnest after it reported a
near-doubling of pre-tax losses from a restated Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 65.7m
last year. With lenders demanding large debt repayments, Wembley had to
change tack. After over-expanding in the 1980s and cutting borrowing through
disposals, it had little choice but to seek court approval for a financial
reconstruction.
After almost six months of deliberation, the company and its syndicate of 22
banks will shortly name their favoured rescue package.
The teams waiting on the sidelines boast some well known entrepreneurs. Mr
Leon Black, the former head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham
Lambert, is behind an offer from Apollo Advisers, the US investment house.
Mr Harvey Goldsmith, the music impresario, is thought to be offering a
merger with his promotions business, Allied Entertainments. And Mr Luke
Johnson and Mr Hugh Osmond, who oversaw the reverse takeover of
PizzaExpress, have also pitched in.
A group of 'phantom bidders' has also emerged, among them Mirror Group
Newspapers, Chelsfield, the property developers, and Mr Kerry Packer, the
Australian media and sports mogul.
Sir Brian Wolfson, Wembley chairman, is tired of the speculation. 'There are
only three bids on the table. Packer talked several months ago about taking
a strategic stake but we told him it wouldn't solve the problem. That was a
diversion.'
He has also dismissed a Pounds 250m plan by Stadi Varios, the private
stadium company, to reconstruct Wembley - claiming a larger venue would not
attract any more events.
MGN's interest remains uncertain, while Chelsfield is discussing only the
possibility of acquiring three properties that were part of a sale and
leaseback by Wembley in 1990.
Through all these bids and counter bids, Sir Brian remains the pivotal
character. He has dictated the pace of negotiations and refused even to
enter discussions on some proposals.
At the helm of Wembley since it acquired the stadium complex from BET in
1985, he is emphatic about his preferred scenario. 'We will only be able to
go forward with a rights issue and debt-for-equity swap. All the money
raised will go towards reducing debt.'
As the year-end deadline looms for the next Pounds 30m tranche of debt
repayment, City analysts have detected a shift in the likely outcome. 'None
of the rival bidders want to change the group's operational management and
at least two of the parties don't bring anything in terms of hard cash,'
says Mr Peter Joseph at brokers Peel Hunt. 'I think Wolfson could go it
alone.'
Despite Wembley's woeful debt-funded acquisitions strategy, its banks have
remained faithful and been rewarded by on-time payments. Although write-offs
and hefty interest payments have ripped through the profit and loss account,
its core venue management and greyhound track activities remain profitable.
'The company tripped over a brick in a big way,' says one adviser to the
banks. 'But they've cut costs and stemmed losses in North America. If the
final proposal allows a substantial part of debt to be repaid and the banks
to take part in the regeneration of the business, that would be the
preferred option.'
All the indications are that this is what Sir Brian intends to do, without
outside intervention if possible. Although any deal would dilute the stakes
of existing shareholders, he will be in a strong position when it comes to
recommending an offer.
Not only does Capital Development SA - his family trust - control some 4 per
cent of the company, but he is also likely to receive the support of Rolaco
 -the Saudi-owned investment group - which has built up a 15.17 per cent
stake via Orpington Investments.
'If he can demonstrate things have changed, I bet he'll pull it off without
any of the bidders,' predicted one analyst.
When the banks and the board blow the final whistle later this month, Sir
Brian will most likely end up with his hands on the trophy.

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Wembley Trail: Legacy of ill-judged expansion - Debt
mountain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman of Wembley, is frank about how the stadium and
greyhound track operator saddled itself with a mountain of debt.
'We made some appallingly timed acquisitions and bought stuff for cash when
plainly we shouldn't have.'
In a four-year spree between 1988 and 1991, Wembley spent more than Pounds
130m to expand from a London-based venue business into an international
leisure group.
The group bought overseas betting equipment manufacturers, a disco and
hospitality company, five US greyhound tracks, catering interests, a film
distributor and ticketing operations.
At the same time, it also invested heavily in improving its flagship assets
 -the famous north London soccer stadium, conference centre and exhibition
halls.
But then a combination of rising interest rates and recession began to
undermine the strategy.
'We hit the recession at 100 miles an hour with a weak balance sheet,' Sir
Brian admitted.
By the end of December last year, net borrowings stood at Pounds 152.1m  -
equivalent to almost three times shareholders' funds.
Under that debt burden, the balance sheet proved too weak to absorb large
property write-downs, which Wembley made this year following its first
valuation in three years.
The value put on its net assets tumbled from Pounds 175.1m to Pounds 62.8m,
forcing the group to put a Pounds 48.3m loss through its profit and loss
account as an exceptional charge.
The group, meanwhile, embarked on a round of disposals to meet bank demands
for a Pounds 40m debt repayment earlier this year.
Interests in catering, discos, films and ticketing have all been sold or
heavily diluted.
With another Pounds 30m debt repayment due at the end of the year, Wembley
is now considering selling the US greyhound tracks - acquired for Dollars
92.5m (Pounds 57.8m) in 1989.
Sir Brian, who is thought to be negotiating with possible bidders in the US,
said: 'If you add up all the disposals, we might be 10 or 15 per cent down
(on what was paid) in one way or another.'
'But the devastating loss was on the property,' he added, referring to the
impact of last year's revaluation on the balance sheet and the P&amp;L.
With pre-exceptional operating profits failing to meet interest payments
last year, a capital reconstruction with the banks swapping debt for equity
is one of the few options left.
The Wembley chairman has no illusions about the challenge. 'We need a
substantial infusion of new equity. This is not a sticking plaster, it's a
total care package.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / The Wembley Trail: Dealings under scrutiny - Dutch link
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Share dealings involving Wembley are to be investigated by receivers at one
of its former shareholders, which collapsed last year with debts of Fl 158m
(Pounds 58.2m).
Trenite Van Doorne, the law firm, said it plans to examine dealings between
Wembley and United Dutch Group, the investment vehicle which in 1990
acquired a large stake in the stadium operator.
At the time, UDG controlled 16 per cent of Wembley. Its stake, however, had
fallen to 7.4 per cent when receivers were appointed in May 1993.
'All the UDG transactions will be investigated,' said Mr Gerhard Gispen,
joint administrative receiver at TVD. 'I also want to know if the original
acquisition of the Wembley stake was fair or not.'
UDG inherited the stake from United Dutch Holdings, a separate vehicle which
acquired its shares from members of the consortium behind the 1985 Wembley
takeover. Sir Brian Wolfson, Wembley chairman, was deputy chairman of UDH
until it reversed into ICA, the Dutch property group, in 1990.
The group was renamed UDG and Sir Brian was a member of its supervisory
board until 1992. 'My only role was to defend the interests of Wembley,' he
said.
Shortly before UDG went into receivership last year, it sold a 9.4 per cent
stake in the stadium group. Meanwhile, control of UDG's remaining 7.4 per
cent stake was transferred last autumn to Shingle, a Netherlands Antilles
investment company.
The London Stock Exchange was never informed of this deal, despite rules
requiring disclosure of transactions involving more than 3 per cent of a
listed company. Although the purchaser had prime responsibility for the
disclosure, an Exchange official said: 'Once they had told the listed
company (Wembley), then it should have let the Exchange know.'

MoDo, the Swedish pulp and paper group, said yesterday it had agreed to sell
a 25 per cent stake in Slave Lake Pulp Partnership (SLPP) to Canada's
Alberta Energy Co (AEC). The disposal, which will give AEC 100 per cent
control of the partnership, would generate a SKr200m (Dollars 27m) pre-tax
capital gain for the Swedish group.
The sale is conditional on AEC going ahead with a plan to float its forest
products division, which includes SLPP. SLPP owns a modern pulp mill in
Alberta, Canada, with annual capacity of 130,000 tonnes of aspen pulp.

Strong growth in semiconductor sales helped US electronics group Texas
Instruments to a 27 per cent rise in net income in the third quarter, to
Dollars 186m. Sales were up 19 per cent to Dollars 2.57bn.
TI attributed a 27 per cent sales rise and strong profits growth in its
components division to improved results in semiconductors and strength in
electrical controls. However, sales and profits in defence electronics were
flat.
It expects defence profits in the fourth quarter to be lower than last year.
Earnings per share were up 26 per cent at Dollars 1.54. The dividend was
raised 39 per cent to Dollars 0.25. The shares rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars
67 3/4 before the close. AST Research, the world's fifth biggest personal
computer manufacturer, has issued its second profits warning in just over a
month. It said sales in its first quarter would be down 4 per cent, rather
than flat as previously estimated, and forecast a net loss of between
Dollars 39m and Dollars 40m for the quarter. It said it would shed 10 per
cent of its 6,900 workforce and close its factory in Fountain Valley,
California.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: New Look to join market with forecast
Pounds 150m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New Look, the rapidly expanding women's wear chain that already has almost
as many shops as Etam - albeit much smaller - is planning to float early
next month.
The group hopes to have a market value of more than Pounds 150m. Profits for
the six months to September 24 are expected to be about Pounds 10m on
turnover of Pounds 59m.
New Look has 221 outlets, including 10 in France, but opened its first
London branch, in Oxford Street, only last week. It has grown from a single
shop in Taunton, opened by Mr Tom Singh, founder and deputy chairman,
straight from university in 1969.
The company is wholly owned by the Singh family. About 35 per cent of the
equity is coming to the market through a placing and intermediaries offer.
Mr Singh, who will have about 9 per cent of the company after flotation,
will not be selling any shares. He explained that his family wanted to
realise some of their investment, most of which will go into family trusts.
The flotation will raise about Pounds 10m of new money. Of this Pounds 6.5m
will go on freeholds, including Pounds 5m for the Weymouth distribution
centre opened in April.
Flotation fees will account for Pounds 2.5m, and the remaining Pounds 1m
will be added to working capital to cover seasonal trading. This will leave
the company virtually debt free.
Mr Singh plans to add 40 shops a year to the chain for the next five years,
doubling the number of shops and tripling the sales area.
He attributes the group's growth to such factors as prime sites, a broad
customer base of 15 to 50-year-olds, prices 10 per cent below the
competition, a high stock turn rate and well developed electronic
information systems.
The group expects its strong cash flow (Pounds 13m last year) to fund its
Pounds 7m a year capital expenditure programme. Over the last four years
operating margins have improved from 4 per cent on sales of Pounds 17.5m to
12 per cent on Pounds 88.5m.
Sponsors are J Henry Schroder Wagg and brokers James Capel. The pathfinder
is due on Monday.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Aerostructures' second warning: A look at
the saga of a share price collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY and DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been an interesting six months for Mr Andy Barr, the dour Scottish
chief executive of Aerostructures Hamble, the company which makes aircraft
sections for British Aerospace.
He has moved from talking confidently of his group's prospects at the
company's flotation, through pocketing a Pounds 1.75m profit when the
company was floated at 120p a share, via a production crisis and management
failure, to two profits warnings, a share price collapse to 24p and his own
early retirement with a stress-related illness.
Shareholders, who stumped up Pounds 39m when the company was floated in
June, have seen the value of their investment drop by 80 per cent and are
understandably hopping mad. The company's adviser, NM Rothschild, and its
non-executive chairman, Lord King, have been severely embarrassed. On top of
that, the collapse raises questions about the whole process of new issues in
London.
The problems apparently started innocently enough in February, when
Aerostructures finished work on the first of a batch of Harrier fighter
aircraft sections.
Unfortunately, there were quality difficulties with the aircraft sections,
so in May shopfloor managers instructed the factory to produce components
for the entire batch of 12 Harriers, sufficient for two years, instead of
the normal three months' stock. The factory geared up to do this and no-one
seemed to notice that unusual work patterns were developing.
In June British Aerospace, Aerostructures' dominant customer, said that it
wanted to increase the production rate of its Hawk 100 and 200 light
fighters. Aerostructures agreed. At this point the factory seized up. Much
of the effort was going into making the unnecessary Harrier parts and as a
result critical components for other orders could not be made. Several
important contracts started to fall badly behind in the gridlock.
Unfortunately again, over this period much senior management time was
diverted to preparing the company's flotation. Aerostructures had been
bought out from BAe two years previously and several directors stood to make
a handsome profit.
It was not until July 12 that a senior management committee discussed the
seriousness of the production problems. Mr Brian Barr, the chief executive's
son who had come with his father from Rover, was the production director
responsible for the factory's performance. He made a profit of almost Pounds
600,000 on the shares he sold at the flotation in June.
Mr Barr remains with the company, although he has been moved to engineering.
Two days after the meeting Mr Andy Barr went on holiday for two weeks. On
August 1 he returned to say that his doctor had instructed him to take a
month's leave.
Several orders for future work were also cancelled in August. BAe, which had
promised the company work in 1995, suspended any decision until the problems
were resolved.
On September 6 Mr Barr finally went to Lord King with several handwritten
pages of notes to confess that there was a serious problem. Rothschild was
informed on September 15 and a profits warning issued a week later.
Since then an investigation has been going on and the company produced its
second profits warning yesterday.
Mr Andy Barr accepted early retirement without compensation last week. He
will receive a pension of about Pounds 40,000 a year.
The company's results, for the six months to June, showed little sign of the
damage. That will show up in the second half.
Next year the company expects turnover to drop by about 20 per cent. Whether
it makes any profit depends on whether orders can be met and costs cut.
In part, the crisis arose because senior managers took their eye off the
ball. Both Andy and Brian Barr were keen to introduce Rover-style lean
manufacturing techniques which applied to mass production, and may not have
properly monitored the old-style techniques used in the Harrier.
It is also questionable whether redundancies made in 1993 removed key skills
in manufacturing and process management, which the company needed to prevent
such disasters.
Aerostructures says that the redundancies made no difference; nevertheless
it has recently been trying to hire people with experience of Harrier
manufacture.
Then there is the issue of whether the flotation prompted managers to cut
too many jobs to improve profits, and then took up too much of their time in
preparing mountains of paperwork. It may be that the cumbersome process,
designed to protect investors, played a part in precipitating the crisis.
One City figure who understood the deal said: 'I think this raises questions
for the regulators about the way we handle deals for companies of this
size.'
Earlier this year Mr Andy Barr, sitting in his elegant office in a 1750s
listed house on the Hamble site, said: 'Not until we came from Rover down
here did we realise how Rover had moved in practices and quality.'
Aerostructures was 'getting leaner all the time - but it gets tougher as you
go on'. For Aerostructures' shareholders, it certainly did.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat lenders agree on way forward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lenders to Queens Moat Houses, the struggling hotels group, appear close to
resolving the stalemate that has held up completion of the Pounds 1.3bn debt
restructuring for several months.
The talks have been stalled for some time over treatment of Queens Moat's
leasing obligations on six of its better hotels, as well as by tough
negotiations with secondary debt lenders.
The main lenders are understood to have felt that the lessors should make
compromises, for example by agreeing to a standstill on leasing payments, to
ensure the survival of Queens Moat.
The lessors, which include Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland and
Hambros, are thought, for their part, to have been unwilling to compromise
their position, given the quality of the hotels.
Queens Moat sold and leased back the hotels in 1991 in a Pounds 66m deal.
The company has a 30-year lease on the properties and the lessors were at
the time guaranteed rent increases from Queens Moat of 7 per cent a year.
However, it is now believed that a financial arrangement has been welcomed
by all parties which opens the way for a restructuring to be completed next
month.
This could mean that the shares, which have been suspended since March 1993,
might resume trading just before Christmas or at the beginning of the year.
Even so, there remain difficulties with at least one lender who purchased a
substantial amount of debt in the secondary market.
Queens Moat refused to comment on the details of any arrangements. However,
it said it was encouraged by progress. 'It is a great deal better, but there
is some way to go,' the company said.
Queens Moat has been in restructuring talks for the last 18 months. Most of
the company's 74 lenders have agreed restructuring proposals - which include
a substantial debt-for-equity swap.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Independent British Healthcare pulls float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independent British Health-care, which has 17 hospitals spread between
Stirling in Scotland and Tunbridge Wells in Kent, has decided to pull its
flotation.
Mr Keith Chadwick, founder and chief executive, said yesterday that the
group, which was hoping to float later this month with a market
capitalisation of Pounds 45m, 'was not prepared to sell cheaply - it's that
simple'.
The market was not looking too clever, he added, and interest in the float
was 'not massive'.
He has written to the 2,400 shareholders, many of them doctors, telling them
the flotation has been delayed.
The group, which makes 80 per cent of its profits through private medical
insurance, was planning to raise about Pounds 20m of new money through a
placing. Beeson Gregory was both sponsor and broker.
The money would have been used to reduce net debt of some Pounds 37m,
cutting gearing from about 130 per cent to 45 per cent.
Mr Chadwick, who holds 11.5 per cent of the equity, and fellow directors
were not planning to sell any of their stake. He described September as a
'bumper' month for the group. In addition a big investor had taken up Pounds
2.75m worth of options, giving the group enough cash to continue its
expansion. Brightreasons, owner of the Pizzaland restaurants chain, might
delay its flotation plans, which remain 'subject to market conditions'. Mr
Michael Guthrie, founder and chairman, said yesterday that the board had
still made no final decision. The group said last month it would float at
the end of October when it announced its annual results. The board meets in
two weeks' time.
Accounting snags over the complex treatment of Chilean investors and
interests have delayed the Pounds 50m flotation of Seaperfect, the scallop
and clam farmer. The company plans to raise Pounds 20m through an
institutional placing.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Malaya Group acquires Heron Motor for
Pounds 16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Malaya Group, the USM-quoted motor distributor, yesterday confirmed it had
acquired by auction Heron Motor, the motor dealership arm of Mr Gerald
Ronson's Heron group, for Pounds 16m cash.
Having beaten 13 other bidders in 'an exceedingly close race', Mr Nick
Lancaster, Malaya managing director, said the consideration was 'a fair
market price' and suggested Malaya was successful because it was more easily
able to meet manufacturers' franchise requirements: it is obliged to dispose
of the Rover and Land-Rover dealership in Bow, a sale expected soon.
The consideration is to be met by a placing of some 67.3m new ordinary
shares at 20p apiece to raise about Pounds 13.5m and new borrowing
facilities of Pounds 3m from Midland Bank.
Mr Lancaster said the price included Pounds 6.75m for goodwill and the rest
for the net assets. The goodwill was high, he said, because of the quality
of the London-based HR Owen trade name, the main part of Heron Motor along
with HMG (Bromley) and Stockport-based Hollingdrake.
The deal had taken a week longer to strike because raising the equity was
'tougher than we thought', he added.
Malaya directors are to pay Pounds 1.93m to subscribe for 9.66m shares out
of a possible entitlement of 16.6m for Pounds 3.32m.
Mr Lancaster said the deal would give the group a portfolio evenly balanced
between volume cars (trading under the Citygate name) and specialist cars.
Turnover of the combined group will be about Pounds 240m to Pounds 250m.
Heron Motor was the last trading business to be sold by Heron International.
Holders of Pounds 378m debt in HI have been offered Pounds 142m cash for 51
per cent by HNV Acquisition, which is controlled by US entrepreneur Mr
Steven Green and has Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Michael Milken's family trusts
as backers.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Holders' shares fall on warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Holders Technology fell 24p to 95p yesterday after the supplier to
the printed circuit board industry warned that profits would fall this year.
The company, which distributes high precision tools and specialist
equipment, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 446,000 on turnover of Pounds
4m for the year to November 30.
Mr Rudi Weinreich, chairman and chief executive, blamed his company's
performance on tighter UK margins.
In July the company's shares dropped 32p to 147p when it announced a 39 per
cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 152,000, despite an 11 per
cent rise in turnover to Pounds 2.21m.
This year's profits are also likely to be depressed by the consolidation of
Holders' 30 per cent holding in Dyconex Engineering, the Swiss company which
was acquired in March.
However, Holders expects 'a marked increase' in sales next year after
completing changes to its product range.
Mr Weinreich said the company intended to maintain last year's 6p dividend
to external shareholders.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Tie Rack rise held to 6% by French result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Tie Rack, the fashion neckwear and accessories retailer,
rose 6 per cent from a restated Pounds 384,000 to Pounds 407,000 in the 28
weeks to August 14, its seasonally weak half.
The company scoffed yesterday at reports that it was considering any action
against British Rail as a result of the adverse impact of the summer's rail
dispute on its outlets within BR stations.
Mr Nigel McGinley, chief executive, said the stoppages had been 'an
irritant', but were 'of no major consequence'. He estimated that they had
affected Tie Rack's UK retail sales by up to 2 per cent in July and August,
and sales in the first six months by 'less than half a per cent'.
He said that the summer's hot weather across Europe had a much more
inhibiting affect on sales.
Like-for-like sales fell 5 per cent, said Mr McGinley, because of the
weather, declines in Australia and the Netherlands as well as France, and a
reduced range of higher value items. In spite of continued losses from the
now reorganised US operations, Mr Roy Bishko, chairman, said it was 'a
satisfactory first half'.
With operating profits up 18 per cent to Pounds 353,000 (Pounds 299,000) on
turnover 11 per cent ahead at Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 33m), the pre-tax line
was affected by losses doubled to Pounds 202,000 (Pounds 82,000) at the
French associate and interest receivable up by Pounds 89,000 at Pounds
256,000. Cash balances grew to Pounds 9.5m (Pounds 6.9m).
Mr McGinley said margins improved by about 1 per cent, as the company
achieved higher volumes with the same fixed costs. In the half, 13 new shops
were opened, bringing the number of countries where it trades to 18.
Earnings rose to 0.53p (0.47p) per share and as usual there is no interim
dividend.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Senior shares dive on profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WIGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Senior Engineering fell by a third yesterday after the company
warned that its 1994 profits would be 'significantly' lower than last year's
Pounds 24.2m.
Analysts cut their forecasts from about Pounds 28m to Pounds 18m after the
group said it had suffered significant losses on a contract in its thermal
engineering division which would only break even. The shares fell from 106p
to 72p, about half this year's high of 150 1/2 p.
Mr John Bell, chief executive, admitted the news was 'particularly
disappointing' for shareholders which supported a Pounds 67m rights issue at
115p in March.
Analysts expressed surprise that the warning came only seven weeks after
Senior's interim statement, which made no reference to contract problems.
Mr Bell replied: 'We knew we would lose a little money on the contract at
the time of the interims, but not sufficient to mention it. Over the past
two to three weeks the cost to complete kept going up.'
He said that the contract, which is in the UK, was of a type the group had
not tackled before, but would give no further details. Senior plans to make
a claim against the customer but will make full provision in its 1994
figures.
Engineering contracting is a notoriously difficult business, and analysts
yesterday criticised Senior for playing down its continued exposure
following the closure of its large power project contracting arm in 1992.
'Investors who had been told not to worry about contracting will be pretty
angry now it has jumped up and bit them,' said one analyst.
Mr Bell said that some of the division's delayed orders, mentioned in the
interim statement, had since come through and that significant management
changes had been made. But he added that the division's future was being
reviewed 'in all sorts of ways'.
The group said problems with other contracts came to light during a review
started by Mr Kevin Gamble when he assumed responsibility for the division
in the summer.
He replaced Mr David Bebb, who ran the division for four years and is now in
charge of developing the group's interest in Asia Pacific. Mr Bell would not
comment on Mr Bebb's position.
Senior said it would at least maintain its final dividend, giving a total of
3.4p. Albert E Sharp, the house broker, is predicting a sharp recovery in
profits to Pounds 29.5m next year.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Barr brothers seek boardroom changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WOLFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two family shareholders of Barr and Wallace Arnold Trust yesterday forced
the motor distribution and leisure group to call an EGM over the future of
two directors.
Nicholas and Robert Barr, whose family owns 25 per cent of the group's
shares, called the meeting to unseat Mr John Parker, chief executive, and Mr
Brian Small, finance director.
Earlier this week the two brothers met their uncle, Mr Malcolm Barr,
chairman of Barr and Wallace, to discuss the company's strategy.
The brothers are understood to want to separate the group's motor and
leisure divisions and reduce central overheads.
They want to appoint themselves to the board alongside Mr Helmut Schweimler,
a former managing director of Hetzel Reisen, the German holiday company. The
two said they did not look upon this as a family feud.
However, it is understood that the group sees the brothers' actions as an
attempt to return it to family control.
Mr Malcolm Barr, who owns 16 per cent of the Barr and Wallace shares,
defended the group's strategy. 'The board appointed John Parker and Brian
Small earlier this year,' he said. 'Developments since those appointments
have confirmed that we made the right decision.'
Last month Mr Parker said he was brought in to 'look at changing the culture
of the company' but added that the Barr family was being proactive in the
process.
The company, which was founded in 1911 by Mr Malcolm Barr's father, Robert,
reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.4m on turnover of Pounds 138m in the
year to end-December.
Mr Nicholas Barr was previously development director of Barr and Wallace. Mr
Robert Barr is managing director of Trust Leasing, which he bought from Barr
and Wallace for Pounds 2.15m in July.

Brooks Service Group, the textile rental and retail services company,
continued the recovery seen in the second half last year with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 61,000 for the six months to June 25, against losses of
Pounds 57,000.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 11.5m).
Mr Simon Brooks, chairman, said that although there was a slight upturn in
market conditions the profits improvement came mainly through tight cost
controls and cash and debt collection.
Earnings per share worked through at 0.34p for the period compared with
0.31p losses while the interim dividend is lifted to 0.75p against 0.5p.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Cost cutting planned at Royal Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Royal Insurance, the composite insurer, yesterday confirmed that it had
begun a reorganisation programme intended to cut overheads as well as
improve customer service.
The company said its plans to increase specialisation at 12 regional offices
covering non-life business and improve work processes might lead to fewer
jobs though it had set no figure. It did not rule out compulsory
redundancies but hoped staffing levels could fall as a result of staff
turnover.
Mr Roger Prideaux, public affairs manager of Royal's general insurance
division, said that in an increasingly competitive sector 'we must be more
open-minded and flexible than we have been before'.
Royal Insurance said that from next year regional offices would no longer
handle all aspects of its businesses, from business development to claims
settlement. Instead they would develop expertise in working with particular
customers such as national brokers dealing in 'big ticket' commercial
insurance policies, financial intermediaries, and private individuals.
Mr Prideaux did not envisage large-scale movements in staff, although
management responsibilities would change. Many backroom staff would be
offered retraining, he said.
Royal suffered heavy losses in the early 1990s but recently reported a
Pounds 139m increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 191m for the first six
month of this year.
The shares fell 9p to 290p.

FT  15 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Attwoods accuses Laidlaw of depressing
share price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Attwoods, the waste services group, yesterday accused its largest
shareholder of prejudicing the interests of other investors as it launched
its defence to the hostile Pounds 364m bid by US predator Browning-Ferris
Industries.
The company also announced a fall to Pounds 9.1m (Pounds 33.1m) in pre-tax
profits from continuing operations for the year to July 31. Sales improved
to Pounds 364m (Pounds 346m).
Profits were affected by substantially higher than expected exceptional
charges of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 2m) for the settlement of litigation in the
US, write-downs and reorganisation costs.
The dividend is maintained at 5p with an unchanged final of 3.25p proposed.
Earnings fell from 8.96p to 1.8p per share.
Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods' chief executive, said BFI's offer was a 'low-ball
bid' pitched at a price depressed by the 'increasingly desperate attempts'
of Laidlaw to sell its substantial stake.
Mr Foreman said Laidlaw's new management was under pressure from investors
to dispose of the stake before the end of the year. Attwoods exhorts
investors to 'recognise the action of a forced seller for what it is and
ignore it.'
Attwoods also sought to reject BFI's claims that its track record was worse
than that of its peers. Between 1984 and 1991, the company said, it had
achieved compounded annual growth of 25 per cent. Only between 1992 and
1994, had it been affected by adverse market conditions.
Trading was expected to improve substantially next year, Mr Foreman said,
with recovery beginning to feed through in the UK and US.
BFI dismissed Attwoods' promises of improvement next year as 'not
particularly credible. They promise every year things will turn up and every
year things turn down'.
Mr Greg Muldoon, BFI's development director, said Attwoods' results showed a
fourth quarter some 49 per cent lower than last year.
The market was also unenthusiastic about Attwoods' defence. 'They are trying
desperately to defend a situation which probably cannot be defended,' said
Mr Roger Hardman of Granville.
However, most analysts expected BFI would have to increase its offer of 109p
per ordinary share, representing about Dollars 8.59 per American Depositary
Receipt. With the shares in London at 115p, one analyst said the real
question now would be 'just how badly does BFI want this company?'

FT  15 OCT 94 / A prize too many for peacemakers: David Horovitz argues that
giving the Nobel peace award to Rabin, Arafat and Peres is premature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The selection of Israel's prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, foreign minister
Shimon Peres, and the Palestine Liberation Organisation's chairman Yassir
Arafat as this year's winners of the Nobel peace prize is a clear gamble.
One of the members of the prize committee, Kaare Kristiansen, even announced
his resignation on Friday in protest at the decision.
Quite apart from any doubts over how deserving the winners may be, or how
appropriate the prize is in view of their backgrounds, the decision is based
on hopes of peace, rather than peace itself.
There is little doubt that these three men have been the dominant figures
associated with the introduction of limited self-rule for the Palestinians
of Gaza and Jericho - a process that holds out the prospect of an eventual
permanent resolution to decades of conflict.
And there is little doubt, too, that the three men deserve praise and
respect for shaking hands on a deal that involves risks and painful
compromises on both sides.
But what is most certainly in doubt is whether that deal will bring lasting
peace between the two peoples, and real rehabilitation to the impoverished
occupied terri-tories.
Extremism, on both sides, remains a huge problem, as the events of this week
have demonstrated.
On Sunday, two Palestinian gunmen from the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist
group rampaged through central Jerusalem, firing hundreds of bullets along a
row of crowded restaurants and bars, miraculously killing only two people
before they were themselves shot dead.
Members of the same organisation later kidnapped a 19-year-old Israeli
soldier, Nachshon Waxman - demanding the release of 200 Palestinian
prisoners for his return - but he was found dead when rescuers stormed the
Hamas hideout where he was being held.
Meanwhile, Israeli courts have indicted four Jewish settlers in the past
fortnight for their alleged involvement in plans to attack Arabs - through a
suspected underground movement.
Few are the peacemakers who do not have extremist opponents to contend with.
But while Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat have criticised their respective
rejectionists for doing their utmost to derail the peace process, both
leaders have been criticised for their lack of direct action.
Mr Rabin was accused by many Palestinians of doing too little to curb
settler violence - until he was shocked into action by the February massacre
at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs, when a settler slaughtered 29
Palestinians kneeling in prayer.
And many Israelis, including Mr Rabin, feel that Mr Arafat is still pursuing
far too soft a line against Hamas. The PLO leader, they argue, has failed to
disarm a relatively small number of violent militants for fear of sparking
confrontation.
Indeed, at the height of the Waxman kidnap crisis, the Israeli leader told
his peace partner starkly that he had to make 'a strategic choice' between
abandoning the autonomy process or facing up to Hamas.
With the Cairo talks, at which Israel and the PLO had been discussing the
next phases of the autonomy programme, suspended by Israel in the wake of
the Waxman kidnapping, the timing of the Nobel award may have been
ill-judged. The process of Israeli-Palestinian reconciliation looks far too
vulnerable for its protagonists to receive the honour.
Israeli troops have handed over authority in much of the Gaza Strip and in
Jericho to Palestinian policemen, but most of the complex stages of the
phased transfer of power still lie ahead.
Democratic Palestinian elections, the first real test of Mr Arafat's ability
to mature from being the symbol of a liberation movement to a statesman
ready to accept the will of his people, were supposed to have taken place
this summer, were then postponed until the autumn, and are now unlikely to
be held this year at all. The suspension of the Cairo talks, which had been
focusing on unresolved central issues such as voter eligibility and the
nature and powers of the body to be elected, will mean an even longer delay.
And the Israeli army's redeployment outside Arab population centres in the
West Bank, an exceptionally complicated logistical operation given the need
to maintain protection for 130,000 Jewish settlers, has also been repeatedly
post-poned.
Last year, the Nobel committee selected another pair of peacemakers, Nelson
Mandela and FW de Klerk of South Africa, for the prize. And the advocates of
a Rabin-Peres-Arafat award doubtless argued that, just as with the
transitions in South Africa, the Israeli-Palestinian accommodation could
only be boosted by recognition from Oslo.
But while Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk clearly respect each other and quickly
forged a trusting, genuine working relationship, the awkward body language
whenever Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat meet points to a deep mutual antipathy. They
rarely look at each other, much less embrace. Even the handshake that
launched the autonomy process at the White House 13 months ago was an
uncomfortable affair, with an obviously reluctant Mr Rabin grudgingly and
only briefly proffering his hand to the more demonstrative Mr Arafat.
Moreover, Mr Arafat's performance since the accords has been unimpressive.
Crucially, in Israeli eyes, he has failed to honour a central element of the
peace deal - his commitment to ensure the deletion of sections of the PLO
Charter that call for Israel's destruction.
Put another way, the Nobel committee is honouring Mr Arafat for signing a
peace deal with a state that his own movement remains formally determined to
elim-inate.
Of more practical significance, Mr Arafat's continuing insistence that he
should oversee the disbursement of international aid for the redevelopment
of Gaza is gravely undermining rehabilitation efforts. Would-be donors and
investors are holding back their funds, while vainly demanding the
establishment of democratic, accountable Palestinian financial institutions.
Such reservations are echoed within the PLO. Abu Ala, a leading figure in
the autonomy negotiations, came close to resigning his post as Palestinian
economics minister last month, in frustration at Mr Arafat's reluctance to
delegate financial authority.
There is a pleasing consistency to the notion of Mr Rabin and Mr Arafat
following the late prime minister Menachem Begin and the assassinated
president Anwar Sadat, architects of Israeli-Egyptian peace 15 years ago,
into Nobel history. But, all in all, it might have been prudent for the
committee to have waited at least another year, to have given peace in the
occupied territories more of a chance to prove itself.

FT  15 OCT 94 / A word in your ear . . .: A look at the the role of
parliamentary lobbyists in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When MPs return to Westminster next week, a top-level House of Commons
inquiry into MPs' outside interests will get fully under way.
The incident that triggered the inquiry by the privileges committee, which
is composed of senior MPs, was July's disclosure in a Sunday newspaper that
two Conservative MPs had been willing to accept payment of Pounds 1,000 for
tabling parliamentary questions from journalists posing as businessmen. But
the subjects investigated will be more widespread than that.
One subject is expected to be the nature of the ties, such as directorships
and consultancies, that link some MPs with professional lobbying and public
relations companies. A leading lobbyist said earlier this year that he
thought the inquiry would 'inevitably' scrutinise such links.
The profession has acquired a reputation for being obscure and patchily
regulated. The public pictures lobbyists in smoky Westminster bars,
exchanging dubious favours on behalf of their clients with MPs on the make.
This is a jaundiced view. Nevertheless, pressure is mounting for a
comprehensive regulatory framework. Most lobbyists favour statutory
measures, in part to help root out unscrupulous practitioners, although the
industry is split over what the restrictions should be.
The pressure for stricter regulation comes partly as a result of the
industry's success. Professional lobbying in the UK has expanded from next
to nothing 20 years ago to an industry with an annual turnover estimated at
Pounds 20m. Its influence can be detected in almost all government
decision-making processes.
The task of the lobbyist is to maximise clients' knowledge about - and, if
possible, influence over - political decisions. This applies whether the
lobbyist works exclusively for a company or trade body, such as the Brick
Development Association, or for a specialist firm that could deal with a
wide range of clients.
Part of the trick is to ensure that clients' views are presented as early as
possible in the decision-making process.
Lobbyists keep a close eye on Whitehall's voluminous piles of paper,
alerting clients when they spot developments of interest and arranging
meetings with the decision-makers.
There are plenty of ways for lobbyists to try to change ministers' minds.
Perhaps the commonest - especially at times when the government's majority
is slender, as at present - is for lobbyists' clients to convince a few
backbenchers of the merit of their case.
Letters are often sent to MPs who have shown an interest in the subject. MPs
may be invited to meet the client, often over lunch. Pains will be taken to
ensure the decor and provender are appropriate. If the client is a food
company, for example, a good lobbyist would ensure no rival group's brand
was on the table.
Ingenuity is used to show MPs that issues affecting the client are of
interest to constituents. One campaign mounted last year by the specialist
lobbying firm Ian Greer Associates, against the closure of London's Royal
Marsden Hospital, analysed the hospital's referral lists. Letters were
drafted to MPs with seats well outside the capital pointing out how many of
their constituents were treated there.
Advisers to Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, during its fight with
Lloyds Bank to take over Midland Bank in 1992, unearthed 28 constituencies
with towns that had only one Lloyds and one Midland outlet, which therefore
faced a 'prospective monopoly' of bank branches.
Once backbenchers have been won over, they generally need little prompting
to put pressure on the government by tabling awkward questions, demanding
meetings with ministers and signing early day motions - which are rarely
voted on but are printed on the Commons order paper.
Letter-writing remains a successful campaign tactic. One of the largest
Westminster mailbags was generated by the National Federation of
Sub-Postmasters last year, which wanted to derail government plans to
encourage people to have pensions and benefits paid direct to a bank. The
avalanche of mail produced was the talk of the members' tea room for weeks.
Increasingly, lobbyists are targeting the House of Lords. Unlike in the
Commons, where the government can usually mobilise its MPs to avoid a
defeat, a vote in the Lords is more easily influenced.
For all their success, lobbyists have not been able to tackle their own
image problem. The industry has taken steps to regulate itself more
effectively, but it is divided over what further measures should be taken.
The various trade bodies representing the industry have their own codes of
conduct and plans for registers of lobbyists. But they disagree over whether
MPs should be allowed to act as directors or consultants to public relations
and lobbying firms.
The Public Relations Consultants Association and the Institute of Public
Relations believe such links should continue, arguing that it is not for a
trade body to tell members who should be on their boards.
The Association of Professional Political Consultants, a specialist
lobbyists' group, has banned them because of the risk of conflict of
interest.
The industry has repeatedly pleaded with parliament to put a statutory
framework in place. As long as lobbyists do not abide by common standards,
unscrupulous operators who do not belong to an association can continue to
give the industry a bad name.
Mr Tony Newton, the Commons leader, has said that in his view 'a voluntary
code would be better'. Industry insiders, however, say respectable lobbyists
have nothing to fear from tighter regulation.
The test will be whether the industry's annual increase in turnover, put by
one Labour MP at up to 25 per cent, can be maintained. Mr Ian Greer,
chairman of Ian Greer Associates, is confident it can: 'There is no sign
whatsoever of the industry putting on less business than it has done over
the last five years,' he says. 'It is a growth industry.'

FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Alliances reinforce retailers' power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms NINA STIMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The rapid expansion of the activities of many well-known retailers  -
from and into all corners of the world - is correctly highlighted by Neil
Buckley ('Retailers' global shopping spree', October 12). However,
international activities take on even more significance when retailer
alliances are taken into consideration.
Of the top 25 retailers in Europe, at least 15 - including Argyll, Asda and
Sainsbury from the UK - operate within cross-border relationships formed
with similar stores. For instance, Sainsbury's 'multi-functional alliance'
with Esselunga from Italy, the Belgian Delhaize group and Docks de France
(SEDD) was formed earlier this year in what Sainsbury described as a
'forceful pan-European association' - no less than one would expect from a
group of companies with a combined annual turnover approaching Pounds 25bn,
almost 3,000 stores across Europe, and around 1,000 in the US]
The various economies of scale on offer from cross-border alliances are
clearly fully appreciated by retailers. However, the considerable power and
influence which can be wielded by such operations is not a force which
should be ignored by manufacturers (or, some might add, governments).

FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right ingredients for education and
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANTHONY QUINN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the links between education and companies, 'Business
lessons on the timetable' (October lO), makes some excellent points. Our BSc
sandwich degree in graphic media studies has had to confront many of the
issues you raise during its 30-year history of preparing students for
careers in printing, packaging, publishing and media.
Our response to the decline in science in schools has been to recruit
humanities and arts students and develop the necessary skills in a practical
environment. This has been successful, with many such students succeeding in
technology.
The article talks about 'work experience in return for low wages'. While
this may be an option for schools and short placements, it is not viable for
a year out in industry during a sandwich degree. Our students receive no
grant for their year out. They have to earn their keep and usually do, being
paid between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 18,000.
An element of added value for a placement is that the student returns to
college to develop a project which can build on the training experience.
Many of these have been of great benefit to companies, resulting in
important product development.
One practice which is to be commended has been for companies to take a
placement student and, if the student is satisfactory, to sponsor him or her
during their final year with a view to employment at the end.
Finally, in recent meetings companies have stressed the need for flexible,
technologically literate graduates who understand the relationships between
traditional print technologies and the increasingly digitally based design
and production process. No doubt this is as true in other industries as it
is in printing.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not really independent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R HAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In their article, 'Labour party in Blackpool: Portillo disdains minimum
wage' (October 3), Philip Stephens and Robert Taylor wrote on a minimum
wage, saying Michael Portillo '. . . anticipated today's Labour conference
debate on the issue by releasing a long dossier of independent analyses
which he said reinforced the Tories' case that a minimum wage destroys
jobs'.
I have reviewed the 16-page 'dossier' and found it to contain mainly: 1) The
'independent opinions' of four City economists, his own Department of
Employment, and those of the Economist, OECD, and London Economics; and 2)
'Business opinions' that include three surveys of business executives, and
two representatives of small business organisations.
Remarkably, only three of the 15 'opinions' are from 1994, with 11 from 1992
and earlier, and one wholly undated. Three of the four City opinions are
from 1991]
While the minimum wage is an issue for the political agenda, independent
work from either party should include some academic content. The Portillo
dossier reflects the (dated) opinions of a few; it does not contain
independent analyses of an academic nature. R Hawkins,

FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Unwise route to take to ensure that
baggage is on board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SIMON EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Kate Bevan's article, 'Looking after your luggage' (Business Travel
supplement, October 10), contained some excellent advice. I would, however,
counsel against following the advice of Mark McCormack to get someone to
look after your bags while you check in and then take them to the gate as a
way of ensuring they do not get misrouted on another flight. Airlines are
wise to this one and you would have to be lucky to get away with it. Nor
should you. Aircraft cabins have limited space for baggage. And all
passengers are entitled to a share of what space there is. More importantly,
airlines are required by law to make sure that all such baggage, of whatever
weight or size, is properly secured - for your safety.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right attitude for isle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HOWARD BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article by James Buxton with its beautiful photograph ('Superquarry
caught in centre of debate', October 10) omits the most important aspect of
this controversy.
Scotia Pharmaceuticals at Callanish, on the adjoining Isle of Lewis, has
said that a proposed plant utilising marine algae can no longer be situated
on Harris if quarrying takes place there, or indeed anywhere within 30
miles, so sensitive is the project to pollution, although an alternative
site can be found somewhere else within the isles.
This proposed pilot plant would apparently employ 10 persons initially,
rising to 60 eventually, all of them in high quality jobs. Moreover, Scotia,
which has a good record of job creation in the isles, is perceived as
considerate in its attitude to the people, while Redland is accused of
arrogance and disdain.

FT  15 OCT 94 / Silver screen glows gold: A team of entertainment mogulsis
challenging the big film studios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Barely a day had gone by in the seven weeks since Jeffrey Katzenberg handed
in his resignation as head of Walt Disney's movie studios without the
Hollywood gossips lining him up with yet another new partner or venture.
This week, the guessing was over. Mr Katzenberg announced that he was
teaming up with his two closest friends: Steven Spielberg, the highly
successful film maker, and David Geffen, the billionaire rock music mogul,
to create a 'dream team' entertainment group.
Their aim is to challenge the leading movie studios that have dominated
Hollywood for decades, such as Disney, which in its last audited accounts
made total revenue of Dollars 2.2bn. The critical question is whether wealth
and talent will be enough to enable them to fulfil their ambitions in the
cut-throat entertainment industry.
'These guys have got great timing,' said Tim Wallace, entertainment industry
analyst at SG Warburg Securities in New York. 'There's huge growth potential
in the industry and no shortage of new investors. But this is a complex and
costly business. They've got lots of talent but enormous egos.'
The three men are dazzlingly wealthy. Katzenberg, 43, is fresh from the
success of The Lion King, Disney's latest animated hit. He is a millionaire
after cashing in his Disney share options.
His partners are two of the wealthiest people in the US. Spielberg, 47,
directed four of the 10 most commercially successful films ever, including
ET and Jurassic Park. Geffen, 51, has become a billionaire by investing the
Dollars 700m he made by selling his Geffen Records stake in MCA to Japan's
Matsushita.
So far, they have been short on detail about their venture. All that has
been said is that they will be equal partners in the company, which will
launch early next year with Dollars 250m of their own capital. Geffen Films
will be merged into the new business, as will Mr Spielberg's Amblin
Entertainment. The venture will develop its own projects in animation,
movies, television, music and interactive entertainment.
The decision to create a fully fledged studio flies in the face of current
industry trends. A studio is a huge enterprise with big buildings, a large
staff and highly sophisticated technology.
No one knows exactly how much it will cost the dream team to launch their
studio. However, industry estimates suggest that if they hope to establish
the company as a force in animation, for example, they will need to make a
total investment of up to Dollars 500m over five years in order to release
at least three films of the same quality as The Lion King.
Most new arrivals in Hollywood have balked at such an expensive and lengthy
investment. Some have bought existing studios as Mr Rupert Murdoch did with
20th Century Fox, Sony with Columbia and Matsushita with MCA/Universal.
Mr Murdoch has made a success of Fox. But Sony is still struggling to
restore Columbia's fortunes, while Matsushita is embroiled in an acrimonious
row with the MCA management over the latter's desire to buy back the
business.
Other recent investors have invented 'virtual' studios by making films in
rented facilities and by making piecemeal investments in independent
producers. Ted Turner, the CNN magnate, adopted this approach in making the
recent cult comedy, The Mask. So did PolyGram, the London-based music group,
with Four Weddings and a Funeral.
However, life in the independent sector can be perilous, as illustrated this
week by Carolco, the independent US producer. It is now struggling for
survival after its proposed merger with the Live Entertainment retail group
collapsed this week.
The risks of launching a studio are even greater. But so are the potential
rewards, particularly in animation, where the studio can count on an
impressionable market of children - and their parents - to boost sales of
video, books, toys and other merchandise associated with film. Disney took
Dollars 267m at the box office in the first four months after launching The
Lion King in the US, but that has been surpassed by the income from
merchandising.
'An animated hit like The Lion King can make a fortune,' said Richard
Grand-Jean, president of Global Film Equity, the New York-based film finance
specialists. 'But Thumbelina, which didn't do well at the box office, made
money from video. And no one is better at animation than Jeffrey
Katzenberg.'
Katzenberg and his partners have chosen a good time to launch their venture.
The traditional movie business is buoyant. Box office takings in the US have
reached Dollars 3.94bn so far this year, according to Variety magazine,
against Dollars 3.82bn and Dollars 3.43bn in the same periods of 1993 and
1992 respectively.
The international box office is even healthier, thanks to the emergence of
new markets in eastern Europe and Asia, most recently in China, where Time
Warner has just signed a distribution deal with the authorities.
The merchandising market is also showing strong growth, as illustrated by
The Lion King's success. Meanwhile, new technology offers exciting
opportunities in movie-making and interactive entertainment for the studios
to explore in the future.
Spielberg is a technology fiend, and was at the forefront of experiments in
digital technology with his special effects for Jurassic Park. He sees the
new studio as an ideal vehicle for his future experiments. The next wave of
technological developments should take the studios into new forms of
distribution, such as CD-Roms for use in the home and more sophisticated
cinemas that replicate movie special effects, such as the physical
experience of being in a car chase, for the audience.
The convergence of the entertainment industry with new technology has
attracted a stream of investors to Hollywood. The misadventures of Sony and
Matsushita have done little to dampen the enthusiasm of the other
electronics, information technology and telecommunications companies, such
as ITT and IBM, that are searching for partners in the entertainment
business.
The new venture will offer an appealing package for investors. Microsoft,
the world's largest software house, has already been mooted as a potential
partner for their studio. There is also speculation of an alliance with the
MCA management if it succeeds in buying the company back from Matsushita.
'The movie business is full of swamps: just look at the problems Sony and
Matsushita have had in Hollywood,' says Oscar Moore, editor of Screen
International, the film industry magazine. 'But Katzenberg and Geffen are
very talented men, and Spielberg has made more money for the film industry
than anyone else in its history. A lot of people will be willing to bet on
them.'
