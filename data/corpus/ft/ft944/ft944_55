FT  03 OCT 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday: After a week in which the US and Japanese trade talks grabbed the
attention of many traders, there will be spate of US and Japanese data for
the markets to watch in days ahead.
In the US, September's purchasing managers' index will be watched for signs
that the recent surge in industrial production is being maintained. In
Japan, data on September's car sales is due today.
Wednesday: US factory order figures are expected to show a rise in August.
Meanwhile, data on German manufacturing orders, due in the middle of the
week, is likely to indicate that orders are growing, particularly in the
capital goods sector, although demand for consumer durables remains weak.
Friday: The US September non-farm pay roll figures are expected to paint a
slightly mixed picture of employment trends, although most analysts believe
the underlying trend is healthy.
In Japan, August's current account is likely to show that the trade surplus
narrowed slightly in the month. Meanwhile, UK trade data is expected to show
a further narrowing of the trade deficit.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (7): Working and living inside
the machine The systems needed to run a commercial building
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Le Corbusier described the house as a machine for living in, but the
metaphor becomes a literal truth when applied to commercial buildings. They
contain a network of systems as complex and interdependent as any production
line.
Most are well hidden, particularly in sleek modern buildings. But you only
have to glimpse the 'inside out' profile of the Lloyd's Building in the City
of London to see some of what normally lies under the skin. Even this jumble
of pipes and ducts only tells part of the story.
A better guide comes every year in the landlord's service bill. Electricity,
security, heating, cleaning, water and lifts suddenly become highly visible.
A company which took great pains to knock Pounds 1 a sq ft off its rent on a
building finds that the heating and air-conditioning maintenance alone has
more than outweighed that saving.
In fact, the average service charge for air-conditioned buildings is running
at more than Pounds 6 a sq ft, according to the annual analysis just
produced by property consultants Jones Lang Wootton. Normally ventilated
ones cost about Pounds 2 a sq ft less. That may represent only a fraction of
overall costs, particularly in high rent and salary areas such as south-east
England. But it represents an area for savings to occupiers who have
struggled through recession and still face tough competition.
One cause for concern is the fact that charges have risen between 6.8 and
7.4 per cent in the past year, according to JLW. Increases look even more
shocking over 10 years: since 1983 charges have soared almost 80 per cent
for air-conditioned buildings and nearly 100 per cent for others. But much
of this can be attributed to more arduous demands from occupiers. Ignorance
is fading as businesses employ more experts and grow to understand the
impact of services on output. Manufacturers have always known that
productivity varies with comfort. Today's office factories are no different.
One of the biggest advances in building services over the past 20 years has
been in the air that occupiers breathe. 'Standards have doubled', says John
Miller, technical services manager for JLW. New city-centre blocks are
sealed from the pollution and noise outside. Each now has a carefully
balanced interior environment where the temperature and air quality is in
the hands of a machine.
A constant battle goes on between suppliers of different kinds of systems.
Chilled ceilings, for instance, are currently touted as a cheaper
alternative to the variable air volume (VAV) methods which became almost
standard in the property boom.
'There are always fashions,' says Kenneth Dale, president of REHVA, the
European Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Associations. He points out that chilled
ceilings were being used more than 40 years ago and are common in
continental Europe.
But the biggest battle is over whether to use any kind of air conditioning
at all - an issue which is dealt with in more detail elsewhere in this
survey. Energy-guzzling systems appear to be doomed as governments seek to
control carbon dioxide emissions, and most technical advances are now taking
place in making artificial ventilation more efficient and healthy.
The other big change in service systems over the past 20 years has been in
the technology. Office buildings in particular have been dragged into the
electronic age. Almost every building today is laced with miles of cabling
carrying power and information to desktop computers, printers, faxes,
photocopiers and modems.
This has fundamentally changed construction methods. New buildings have deep
floor voids to accommodate the cabling and hollow ceilings for the
heavy-duty ducting necessary to draw off heat from the electronics. Older
buildings are probed to find existing gaps for the services - or written off
as obsolete.
'There was also a physical change as information storage moved from the
filing cabinet to the computer disc,' says Graham Love, head of project
consultancy at JLW. In simplistic terms, that meant a move from
concentrating on how much weight each square foot of floor will support to
how much power it can provide.
This aspect has developed into another battle. Older buildings were
under-powered; new ones are over-powered. 'Ten years ago they could handle
around 5 watts per sqare metre but this soared to as much as 40W in the
boom,' says JLW development management partner Paul Boden.
But today's normal user requires only 15W-20W, and these blocks look
embarrassingly overblown at a time when energy-saving is a priority. The
British Council for Offices has brought out guidelines far below this peak.
The industry clearly went too far - an accusation commonly heard from
building service engineers who feel they are rarely brought into the
construction process early enough to point out such errors.
Over-powered buildings exist because agents said this was what the occupiers
demanded. 'But they were forecasting straight-line growth in power demands
without taking into account that the technology would become more
efficient,' says Peter Marks who as head of property management services at
JLW now has the task of explaining big bills to occupiers.
Other 'advances' in building services are less controversial. New technology
has been harnessed to management, making control of various systems more
efficient. Even the most modest warehouse can be fitted at a reasonable cost
with computers which automate control of ventilation, temperature, access
and safety.
The drive for energy efficiency started in the early Seventies with oil
price increases but has continued to make ground through advances in areas
such as boiler technology. Fire engineering has moved forward to cope with
new demands such as enclosed shopping centres, the chimney-like properties
of office atriums, and a host of new health and safety regulations -
particularly from the European Commission.
The closest many occupiers get to perception of the machine around them is
when they stray into the building manager's screen-clad hideaway after
getting out of the lift on the wrong floor. But if the lift itself breaks
down, they realise how dependent they are on this technology.
Making it work is a science. Making it pay appears to be an art.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (6): Is it time to switch to
comfort cooling? - Attitudes to air conditioning are changing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty years ago you would have been hard pressed to find a new building
with full air conditioning in the UK. Such technology seemed pointless in a
temperate climate. Today, it is difficult to find one that is not festooned
with 'comfort cooling'.
The term has been imported from the US - and there lies part of the reason
for this sea change. It is what Tim Battle, an engineer trying to turn back
the tide of technology, calls an invasion by the Coca-Cola society. In other
words, adoption of all things American, glitzy and futuristic in the
constant striving to be modern.
This has infuriated conservationists, who argue that such energy-hungry
systems, with their chlorofluorocarbons and potential health risks, are an
unnecessary luxury.
Some of the very engineers who have to design and build the systems are
often sympathetic. 'Modern technology is very seductive,' says David Lush, a
consultant with Ove Arup and past president of the Chartered Institution of
Building Services Engineers.
Disapproving noises are also coming from the government, which tried earlier
this year to put draconian restrictions on air conditioning in the next
round of building regulation reforms. 'There is a general disappointment
that they failed,' says Kenneth Dales, president of REHVA, the European
Heating and Air Conditioning Associations.
The industry won a reprieve by arguing that blanket restrictions were wrong.
But ministers have made it plain they expect designers to come up with
measures that ensure fewer systems are installed, and that those that get
through are more efficient.
Equipment manufacturers feel the problem has been over-stated. In real
terms, air conditioning accounts for less than 1 per cent of the UK's output
of carbon dioxide and less than 4 per cent of energy consumed by the
commercial building sector, according to York International, the world's
largest producer. Advances in technology are making the figures look even
better, while CFCs will also have disappeared by 1995, it says.
But it is harder to argue away the conclusion that air conditioning has been
overused. Growth of new technology has placed greater demands on cooling
systems from computers crammed into even the most mundane workplace. As the
noise and dirt of city centres kept windows closed, air conditioning soon
became a standard fitting for most city-centre buildings. It then spread to
business parks and suburbs where the need for such systems is less clear.
A combination of recession and fears about global warming may be about to
create another sea change, however. Engineers have always blamed developers
for over-specifying buildings. They, in turn, accuse estate agents, who
claim occupiers will not take anything less than full variable air volume
(VAV) systems.
But one of the country's largest developers is about to test this in a
140,000 sq ft block planned for central Croydon. 'Our findings show that
occupiers are willing to pay a little more for a greener building which cuts
energy bills by 30 per cent,' says Bob Delafield, project manager for
Norwich Union.
This desire to cut running costs - tinged with fear that some kind of carbon
tax will emerge later this decade to make things even worse - is still at
the experimental stage. Building will not start until a tenant decides that
energy-saving is vital and signs up for the space.
Norwich Union is also hedging its bets. This is not one of those 'landmark'
developments which turns up every few years, boasting complete lack of air
conditioning in favour of natural ventilation. 'Those are plainly not
feasible on anything other than a greenfield site where you have freedom to
manipulate important factors like orientation to the sun,' says Graham Love,
head of project consultancy at Jones Lang Wootton.
The Croydon scheme is likely to offer 'appropriate' cooling such as
displacement air techniques, which cut running costs to about half the level
of full VAV. But the designs are still flexible enough for future occupiers
to fit the sort of systems they desire. The building will be 'capable' of
using low-energy methods, says Bill Dickson of architects Sheppard Robson.
Occupiers will have to decide whether to use that capability.
Success will be judged by the business world not in environmental terms but
a swift letting. That could lead to further schemes taking off.
Mr Dickson has three others on the drawing board, while Tim Battle, a
veteran low-energy campaigner with engineers Rybka Smith Ginsler and Battle,
is also hoping to spread his efforts beyond this development. He is advising
the Prudential on plans for 250,000 sq ft of offices on the site of Forbury
House, Reading, an obsolete Sixties building. This could involve
energy-saving construction such as minimising solar gain, as well as
'appropriate' air conditioning.
It is also significant that both are city-centre sites, says Mr Battle,
destroying the myth that such developments are restricted to green fields.
Norwich Union may also try these new ideas on a proposed office block in
City Square, Leeds, although chilled ceilings could be more appropriate for
this site.
No amount of success is likely to see central London, the powerhouse of
office building, swept up in such changes, however. Rents are much lower in
places such as Croydon and Leeds, so running costs play a bigger role and
are more important to tenants. 'If we took this to the City or West End, it
is much less likely to be accepted,' says Mr Delafield.
But success in Croydon would be a significant break with the stultifying
'institutional standard' blamed for blanket provision of full air
conditioning in so many office buildings. Letting agents will take immediate
interest and give way to engineers' pleas for systems which suit individual
needs.
'We are teetering on the edge of change,' says Mr Dickson. 'Developers know
they must provide cheaper buildings. Employers realise that essential staff
will not be retained by flashy gimmicks and gold-plated taps.' That means a
combination of economy and comfort - all within increasingly stringent
regulations.
Air conditioning is not going to disappear, despite the wishes of dedicated
conservationists. But it will be brought under control. Perhaps this is a
good time to change the name to comfort-cooling after all, if only to get
away from the idea that buildings either have air conditioning or don't. Far
more effort will now go into appropriate systems selected from a wide
spectrum of services honed to greater efficiency.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (5): Code of practice published
 -Environmental issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A cartoon sums up some of the thinking behind recent moves on the
environment in the building services industry. It depicts a bright, pristine
planet earth with two figures. One, called The First Client, is drawn with a
god-like flowing white beard and gown. He instructs a small, confused
individual called The First Engineer: 'Okay, now put in the services'.
The next image is of the same planet almost completely covered in smoking
pipes and tubing, oxygen tanks and numerous different gadgets. The client
says to an exhausted engineer: 'Fine, fine. But where do the lifts go?' If
only there had been more communication - if only the engineer had been in on
the act of creation at the beginning - his efforts to supply the end product
with the services it needed would not have been quite so damaging. The
cartoon is used on the cover of a report which aims to do something about
this state of affairs.
The Building Services Research and Information Association published an
environmental code of practice earlier this year. The code, sponsored by a
range of clients and funded by the Department of the Environment as well as
by industry, aims to cover the process of building from inception to
dismantling.
Although most people in the building services industry accept that their
chances of improving the environmental impact of buildings would be enhanced
if they were brought in at the inception of any project, the code aims to
provide advice and recommendations for the 'real world', says its author,
Sandy Halliday, principal engineer and environment section leader at BSRIA.
This world consists of engineers being called in once a building is built,
or for refurbishment once it is already past its prime, or for demolition.
The code, the result of three years' work, will be distributed to
architects, project managers, quantity surveyors and designers as well as
the association's 800 or so building service members. It was sponsored by a
range of clients, from PowerGen and a county council to housing project
groups. 'We realised quite early on that it was pointless trying to do this
in isolation; that everybody involved in building had to realise what was
going on,' says Halliday.
Lack of awareness and lack of communication have been at the root of the
problem for some time, she says. 'Traditionally engineers have been given a
box and told to heat it to such and such a temperature and cool it
afterwards. The work has been thought of in terms of providing equipment
rather than a living environment. There has been no concern about what the
effect on the local environment is going to be, let alone the global one.'
The association felt that the accepted attitude had to change. It soon found
that members were willing to listen. More members of the association
supported the Pounds 140,000 environment project than had supported any
other in BSRIA's 19-year history.
The report focuses on the life cycle costs of a building rather than the
first cost of construction. It deals with the basics - how to improve the
environmental impact of waste disposal, for example - but it also paints the
work of a building services engineer on a wider environmental canvas. It
questions whether a building is actually necessary.
'This sounds radical for a building services engineer,' says Ms Halliday,
'but not enough of us actually ask whether we need a building in the first
place.'
The report warns of the effect that a badly-designed building can have on
the local environment. Demolition of unsightly buildings is a 'wasteful use
of capital resources', it says. It criticises the move away from the use of
sunshine, natural light and air in buildings. 'There has been an increasing
tendency to replace these natural systems with energy-consuming building
services which are frequently more prolific, less functional and less
efficient.'
Many in the industry have already taken on board some of the issues dealt
with by the association's code. The Justham Dunsdon partnership, for
example, has been working on a feasibility study for National Westminster
bank. The engineering consultancy proposes to use a system of air
conditioning or 'comfort cooling' which aims to save the bank Pounds 750,000
a year in energy costs. Most of this saving would be achieved by employing a
system of refrigeration which uses the outside environment.
Keith Dunsdon, principal partner at the company, believes the industry is
only now beginning to wake up to the benefits of environmental technology
and developments. 'We were perhaps too happy in years gone by to use systems
which had worked quite well in one building for all buildings. Now we are
being encouraged to be more innovative as well as practical in our energy
efficiency, for example.'
This change was brought about by a number of factors but particularly the
recession, he says, with 'people expecting twice as much for their money'.
Both he and BSRIA are clear that long-term environmental benefits go hand in
hand with cost savings in winning projects.
Mr Dunsdon adds that the job is easier with educated clients who understand
the advantages of constructing environmentally-friendly buildings.
'Sometimes people are worried about new ideas. We've been lucky in working
with clients that understand.'
A follow-up project will chart the economic and environmental implications
of the code by analysing the effectiveness of case studies in the public and
private sector later this year.
Sandy Halliday says: 'We didn't want to end it there; to say: 'A code has
been drawn up - that's it'. We had to make a judgment about how effective
the recommendations were in actually cutting harmful emissions, improving
the environment and saving money. That's the next step.'
Much of the work in terms of attitude has already been done, she says. 'At
the most basic level, engineers recognise that good sense about the
environment makes good business sense. If you can save money by turning
lights off, and at the same time save a lot more, then you do so.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (4): Beware the back burner -
Tim Burt reviews research and innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When more than 1,200 opera lovers rose to applaud the first night of Figaro
at the new Glyndebourne Opera House, few of them paused to consider the
triumph of engineering behind the scenes.
The Pounds 33m East Sussex auditorium, however, would not have been ready to
stage last May's inaugural production had it not been for the use of
innovative building services technology.
That expertise, drawn together by consultant engineers Ove Arup, depended in
large part on products developed overseas. The cast list of the building's
main equipment suppliers was dominated by international stars such as
Froling, Weishaupt, Trane, Grundfos and Krantz.
Critics of the UK building services industry argue that contractors favour
such products because they represent thousands of hours of research and
development - an area which has been comparatively neglected in the past in
Britain.
'Research and innovation on building services is taken much more seriously
in Scandinavia and North America,' says Dr Leslie Hawkins, director of
occupational health at Surrey University's Robens Institute.
'We have just as many sites affected by sick building problems, but we don't
seem willing to commit the research funding needed to examine it.'
His concern is echoed at the Building Research Establishment (BRE), the
research agency funded partly by the government.
Mr Stephen Willis, head of the new technologies and controls section in the
BRE's environmental systems division, warns that innovation in the UK still
lags behind overseas competitors and is often regarded as conservative.
That fault may be due to the tendency among British architects to first
design a building and only consult building service engineers afterwards to
make the plans work.
With little room to manoeuvre, the engineers sometimes have no option but to
fall back on expensive and costly systems for air conditioning and other
services.
Moves to introduce supposedly innovative ideas, such as manually-opened
windows for natural ventilation, sometimes also run into hostility from
owner-occupiers who regard such ideas as unprestigious and old-fashioned.
In some cases, there has also been a reluctance by the construction industry
to embrace schemes which could threaten their lucrative maintenance
contracts.
The government, according to Mr Willis, has recently urged companies to
change their attitude by taking part in collaborative research funded
jointly by industry and the Department of the Environment.
Pressure to increase research funding mounted following the 1992 Rio
Convention on Climate Change, in which Britain acknowledged the need to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from commercial buildings.
As part of that commitment, the BRE has launched a Pounds 1m energy-related
environmental issues programme, which includes 20 research projects on
subjects ranging from avoiding air conditioning to guidance on refrigeration
systems and the application of neural networks.
Its work is being matched by the Building Services Research and Information
Association (BSRIA), which represents almost 800 contractors, manufacturers
and consulting engineers.
Although it has 21 research projects under way, Ms Anne King, the
association's marketing director, admits: 'We do not compare favourably with
overseas competitors on R&amp;D. Britain spends less than Germany and Japan on
research, even though government backing has not been cut.'
By implication, industry - which funds 23 per cent of BSRIA's Pounds 2m
research funding - could do more to support development of new technology.
But in a sluggish commercial property market, construction companies are
anxious to keeping building service costs to a minimum and have been slow to
change.
There are, of course, buildings which show that innovation works. Mr Stephen
Willis, at the BRE, cites the De Montfort University's new school of
engineering and manufacture as an example.
Part gothic, part art deco - it makes use of natural ventilation and large
areas of glass to maximise light and heat.
Mr Willis claims that similar schemes are relatively rare because of a lack
of training initiatives among the building service engineers who advise on
plans for new or refurbished buildings.
'I don't see a great deal of evidence of professional training. Without
that, one ends up reinforcing the conservatism in British building
services.'
Dr Hawkins at Surrey University agrees. He blames most of the problems on
air conditioning systems, one of the main contributors to sick building
syndrome.
'We seem to be extremely bad at getting air conditioning to work properly.
I've come across a lot of companies with excellent facilities which are
allowed to deteriorate through poor maintenance.'
Claims that a lack of professional training is largely to blame are rejected
by the Chartered Institution of Building Service Engineers.
There has been a shift to continual professional training since the
mid-1980s, according to Ms Jennifer Hand, spokeswoman for the institution.
'Our 15,500 members are required to keep abreast of new developments and we
have increased the emphasis on updating skills for professional building
service engineers,' she says.
Citing changes in the training framework, Ms Hand points to the scheme run
by Ove Arup. Under its training programme, some 300 graduates are guided by
senior supervisors through courses ranging from acoustics to structural
engineering.
'It's a throwback to the apprenticeship system and we now create a gateway
for graduates to pursue the right career as part of a professional review
process,' says Mr Roger Chantrelle, training and development manager at Ove
Arup.
The scheme, however, is thought to be the exception rather than the rule in
an industry under pressure to cut costs and trim back on research and
development spending.
'There is still not enough money being put into prevention of sick building
syndrome through R&amp;D,' says Dr Hawkins.
Industry, it seems, has yet to be persuaded. Under government pressure, it
has paid more attention to research and new innovation. But remedial
maintenance of existing systems is thought to be a more lucrative pursuit
than installing new and innovative products.
In an industry still climbing painfully out of recession, research and
development runs the risk of being consigned to the back burner.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (3): Towards more flexibility -
Cost-effectiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even the most mundane workplace is cocooned nowadays in a network of wire;
data links, several kinds of computer cable, telephone cords and - hiding in
this web - electrical power leads.
'Any change of hardware can result in a change to the cabling,' says Stephen
Hill of Oscar Faber Information and Communications. 'And of course no-one
knows which are the original ones, so new cable is simply piled into the
trunking.'
Moving desks can be just as chaotic, as the confusion over what goes where
is compounded by the fact that nothing seems to match. A PC cannot use a
mainframe terminal wire any more than it can a power lead - as service
engineers sometimes find to their cost.
This is no isolated problem. Offices 'churn' constantly, moving half their
work positions within the first year of occupying a building and up to 30
per cent annually after that, says Mr Hill. More than half require
re-cabling, costing up to Pounds 400 per person.
One solution has emerged over the past five years, however. Structured
wiring schemes (SWS) involve highly specified cabling which can accommodate
a wide variety of users. Conversion equipment and special junction boxes
mean that people and their computers can be moved around easily and simply.
The cabling works for any kind of hardware, so that, too, can be moved or
changed. This cuts the cost of churns to Pounds 20 per person, says Mr Hill.
The extra cost of SWS pays for itself in two or three years.
But what about a mechanical digger waiting to wreak havoc in the road
outside? Simple, he says. Lay in a second, standby, connection. 'The cost is
negligible if provided at an early stage.'
One of the main complaints of engineers is that such systems have to be
retrofitted because they are not involved early enough in planning services.
Developers argue that so much is determined by planners and tightly
constrained finance that it is pointless calling on engineers until the
detailed services are required.
This is compounded by the strangely British way of completing buildings
before anyone knows the specific needs of occupiers. Developers and agents
argue that tenants will not take premises until they see everything in
place. Occupiers then merrily tear out thousands of pounds' worth of
fittings to replace with their preferred options - or make the best of
services such as cabling and air conditioning that are patently unsuitable.
Some progress has been made towards the US technique of taking buildings
only to 'shell and core' stage. This means that the frame and cladding are
finished but only the main services are installed in the core. Occupiers
then specify what they require on the lettable floor areas.
The reason is more to do with a fall-off in speculative development than any
change of heart by developers, however. Pre-lets are now the norm, so they
are dealing with an occupier who will specify the services needed.
The spin-off is more 'appropriate' buildings, says Kevin Cooke, divisional
director of cost consultants AYH Partnership.
'We can now get past the agents and their demands for excessive
specifications,' he says. Power-loading is his particular bugbear. Reducing
the specification on one 400,000 sq ft scheme in London from 25 to 15 watts
per sq metre cut capital spending by Pounds 400,000 and maintenance-running
costs by Pounds 80,000 a year.
Another message getting through to occupiers at this early stage is that
buildings should not be judged solely on initial construction prices.
Life-cycle costing, which takes into consideration the running and
maintenance bills for plant and equipment, has been preached by engineers
and surveyors for years. Now they can make a case directly.
Developers remain unconvinced. 'We see the looks on people's faces when
presented with bare concrete and pipes,' says one. 'They want something nice
to look at before putting their hand in their pocket - even though they know
it could all come out later.'
But while buildings remain hard to let, developers find they have to pay
this double cost of fitting and refitting themselves, so the prospect of
more shell-and-core schemes - and 'appropriate' servicing - has brightened.
Institutional funders are also being won over, as the core services can be
matched to their standards even if letting areas are tailored for individual
users.
Whether this survives a market recovery remains to be seen. But both funds
and occupiers are adjusting to the idea that they should be demanding
buildings flexible enough for tomorrow's tenants - whoever they might be.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (2): Awareness is spreading -
Energy saving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Energy saving has taken on a significance akin to the hunt for the holy
grail. This has less to do with the semi-religious frenzy over global
warming, however, than the grinding weight of economic recession.
During the cost-cutting induced by falling profits, occupiers began to
realise how much they were paying to heat the surrounding neighbourhood.
Despite multiple oil-price shocks, many were still living in the era of
cheap fuel. Luckily, energy-saving has proved a lot more attainable than the
mythical grail.
The campaign to curb air conditioning, dealt with elsewhere in this survey,
has made headlines. Yet supporters claim that it accounts for less than 4
per cent of the energy consumed in commercial buildings and produces less
than 1 per cent of the UK output of carbon dioxide.
Choice of air conditioning also applies mainly to new construction. But the
bulk of the problem lies with existing buildings, whichever way they are
serviced. These are being tackled with a less glamorous, but more
productive, campaign of uprating the management of energy systems.
Energy-saving schemes are not new. The Vickers tank plant in Newcastle, for
instance, was worked over more than 10 years ago by Ryder Nicklin,
architects and engineers. Draught-proofing, integrated energy controls and
low-energy lighting cost Pounds 6m but cut bills by 90 per cent to Pounds
70,000 a year.
This kind of awareness of energy costs is spreading out of the manufacturing
sector, says Ken Ordish, managing director of ESS Projects.
Groups such as NatWest Bank and Bass Breweries have commissioned energy
'audits' of buildings ranging from high street branches to administration
blocks, pubs and hotels.
Other factors than the blitz on costs may be helping this change.
The Building Research Establishment (BRE) has created an Environmental
Assessment Method (Breeam) for testing the 'greenness' of buildings, which
groups such as the BBC and London Transport have promised to use.
Just as important, however, is the work the BRE's Energy Conservation
Support Unit (Brecsu) is doing to get such issues discussed at board level.
Occupiers often have the in-house specialists who know the problems, but
they do not have the communication skills - or status - to get the message
across, says Brecsu. It has persuaded 1,500 top companies to commit
themselves to 're-education'.
Decisions on energy-saving are filtering down from the top, says Mr Ordish.
Now his part of the industry has to solve problems that arose because
service engineers were not consulted in the past. 'It is often a case of
making existing controls work properly,' he says.
'If the people who run buildings were consulted earlier by mechanical and
electrical engineers in the planning of buildings this would not happen.'
Privatisation is also having a big impact. Schools and hospitals find that
the freedom of opting out of state control also brings the burdens of paying
big bills.
Two trusts set up in the Nottingham area, Healthcare and Community,
discovered an energy bill of close to Pounds 1m on 28 premises ranging from
large hospitals to small day centres spread across the city. They also faced
a responsibility to match the government's request to industry for 15 per
cent energy cuts over the next five years.
Phil Winstanley, the energy manager, will be plugging one gap by early
involvement with premises now being built. Existing premises will be drawn
together into a central building service network under which conditions can
be remotely monitored by desk-top computer or the service engineers'
portable lap-tops.
One problem is that two kinds of control equipment are in use - Andover
Infinity on larger sites and Satchwell on others.
This is being tackled by more systematic specification in future, but that
leaves the task of stitching two existing systems together.
ESS has installed building energy management systems (Bems) which should
soon be able to integrate control through a CdC data engine. It should also
be able to cope if other brands of control equipment are required in future.
Tight budgets mean the cost of installation must be covered by energy
savings, and this has already started happening.
The last energy bill came to just over Pounds 1m, which Mr Winstanley
estimates as an 18 per cent cut on two years ago. This should fall further
as ESS works its way through the remaining buildings.
Each has been prioritised through an initial monitoring exercise which gave
ESS a window into the trusts' systems from its base 25 miles away.
Consumption profiles were built up from physical factors and energy use.
Payback periods were decided in co-operation with the finance departments on
a cost ratio basis.
Struggling with poorly specified or obsolete technology is a common factor.
Chesterfield's Saltergate Health Centre had to keep the heating on
permanently because parts were impossible to find, running up bills of more
than Pounds 15,000 a year. But new technology can now cope with this sort of
problem.
Fitting Bems saved the centre the equivalent of more than Pounds 2,700 in
the first 10 months, says ESS.
The system is intelligent enough to adjust water heating to different levels
according to requirements for each part of the building. It even calculates
when to turn on so the temperature is correct at opening time.
Besides a local display board, the controls can be adjusted over the phone
by the health authority's district energy manager.
This helped cut costs by 18 per cent last year, when the older system would
have reacted to the unusually colder weather by pushing the bill 10 per cent
higher.
Monitoring is a crucial part of energy management which is often overlooked,
says Mr Ordish. 'Settings may be ideal when a building is first occupied but
uses - and users - can change.'
Many occupiers will have to remember that energy saving is a continuing task
involving regular audits to ensure that the systems are working correctly.
Those currently driven by concern for the environment may forget this as
fashions change. Then the cycle will come again as recession - or a fuel tax
 -finds them rediscovering the need for cost-cutting.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Survey of Building Services (1): Green conundrum for the
experts - Consumers have been reluctant to pay the price for efficient
service systems. But there are indications that the tide may be turning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two groups of experts sitting down today at opposite ends of the UK will be
trying to solve the same conundrum.
If so much store needs to be placed on cutting costs and saving the
environment why is there so little interest in more efficient, 'greener'
buildings?
In Brighton, more than 50 construction professionals at the annual Chartered
Institution of Building Services Engineers' annual conference will be
exploring why low-energy buildings are so rare. Meanwhile, in Lancashire
builders will be meeting for an update on the fortunes of the National Home
Energy Rating Scheme.
One common factor is almost bound to emerge. Consumers are reluctant to pay
the price for future savings. Efficient systems for handling heating,
lighting, ventilation and the myriad other functions that keep commercial
buildings ticking over cost more.
Occupiers dislike service charges but refuse to accept the higher rents or
construction costs necessary to cut them. Homebuyers are little different,
opting for cheaper houses rather than those with better insulation and
materials.
But the tide may be turning. The government is committed to a 20 per cent
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2005. Buildings in the UK
produce half the carbon dioxide pollution, and will be regulated more
rigorously when new construction regulations come into force next April.
VAT charges on fuel will make homebuyers more sensitive to running costs.
But commercial users are already aware of an energy bill which has soared
past Pounds 20bn a year for UK buildings and threatens to go further if the
expected carbon tax emerges later this decade.
Other worries are also crowding in. Modern buildings have begun to
demonstrate frightening side-effects. Electronics adopted to save costs
appear to require expensive servicing. Staff fall sick for no apparent
reason, and even passers-by can be struck down by invisible bugs.
Security takes on a new dimension. It must combat not only bomb threats in
the City of London but burglars hungry for desk-top computers. Even
hospitals now have to consider elaborate alarms to protect new-born babies.
Fire safety is another problem in sealed office blocks and shopping malls.
Overlaying all this is a drive to cut costs as businesses drag themselves
out of recession. While energy-saving is the main driving force, this
combination of factors has brought the whole range of building services into
prominence.
This is a leading industry worth more than Pounds 8.9bn in 1992: 20 per cent
of the total construction contractors' output, according to the Building
Services Research and Information Association. Mechanical and electrical
engineering alone was estimated at almost Pounds 7.5bn last year.
Many occupiers facing the task of trimming spending would be surprised to
discover the number of activities quietly going on in the background to keep
their building working. An average 10,000 sq ft office block costs more than
Pounds 60,000 a year to maintain, according to the annual Office Service
Charge Analysis (Oscar) of property consultants Jones Lang Wootton (JLW).
The cost includes energy, security, heating, air conditioning maintenance,
management, cleaning, repairs, wages, lifts, insurance and water.
It does not include buildings insurance and applies only to common parts
covered by landlords. Tenants pay extra for their own cleaning, lighting and
other services.
The lion's share goes on energy (Pounds 1.20 a sq ft) and heating/air
conditioning (Pounds 1.05), one reason why a fierce debate now rages over
the energy bill. A non-air-conditioned block costs 30 per cent less to run
than a block with air conditioning (Pounds 4.16 a sq ft instead of Pounds
6.03p), according to JLW.
Much of the debate in Brighton will centre on why air conditioning has
become almost universal over the past decade. Engineers blame this on
developers, who pass the buck to estate agents, who in turn insist this is
what occupiers demand.
The same chain of blame applies to electrical services. Designers vastly
overestimated the needs of modern technology during the 1980s, producing
over-expensive buildings equipped with air systems capable of extracting
vast amounts of heat from electronics and heavyweight electrical systems to
power them.
Many occupiers are paying a premium for ventilation systems that run below
capacity - and therefore inefficiently - plus extra charges to electricity
suppliers for not using up their contracted loads.
Service engineers say this is partly because of their lack of status. 'We
should be brought in earlier to advise on what is really required in
buildings,' says Mr David Lush, a consultant with Ove Arup and former
president of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers
(CIBSE).
Air conditioning is now under scrutiny, however. Manufacturers insist that
it is still necessary in town centres, where noise and dirt preclude opening
windows. They are producing systems which are both 'greener' and more
efficient. Chlorofluorocarbons will soon disappear and blanket use of
full-blown variable air volume (VAV) systems is giving way to partial air
conditioning.
The manufacturers have one eye over their shoulder on the government. Air
conditioning only escaped rigorous controls in next year's reforms of
building regulations because ministers were persuaded the controls would be
unworkable.
It had been suggested that builders justify every system with evidence from
occupiers that such technology was essential. They argued that buildings
were usually constructed long before anyone knew who would occupy them.
But the pressure for reform remains intense. The government expects a more
practicable solution and the British Property Federation and CIBSE are
trying to create either an energy scoring system or an environmental
'shopping list' that can be applied to commercial buildings.
Other pressures are coming from Brussels, where the European Union is
pouring out a stream of directives. 'The problem is that we are not being
consulted,' says Mr Kenneth Dale, president of REHVA, the Federation of
European Heating and Air Conditioning Associations. One rule demanding that
every electrical item had to be checked every year had to be revoked after
service engineers showed the crippling cost of such a task.
Little hard evidence has emerged that changes are taking place on the ground
 -mainly because so few buildings have gone up during the recession. But
some promising signs are looming on the horizon.
Shell-and-core techniques are creeping in, where developers wait for a
tenant before putting in all the services. This gives engineers a better
chance of influencing decisions.
Developers have always claimed that occupiers demand to see finished
buildings - even if that means expensive replacement of unsuitable services
later. But Coca-Cola has made an early claim on an unfinished 80,000 sq ft
block in Hammersmith because it saved having to throw out the developers'
fittings and gave better control over the end product, said Mr Stephen
Watkins, the company's property services manager.
This technique, common in other parts of the world, will become more common,
says Mr Chris Hiatt of JLW, particularly as computer advances allow agents
to take potential occupiers around 'virtual reality' buildings rather than
waiting for a finished one.
The most significant pressures for change over the next few years may come
from occupiers themselves rather than conferences and regulations. Soaring
energy bills, concern over the impact of 'sick' buildings on productivity
and potential legal responsibility for legionnaires' disease bugs in water
systems are all making tenants more aware of the services hidden in their
buildings.
Developers such as Norwich Union have taken up the challenge, offering to
produce blocks which are both greener and cheaper to run. If occupiers take
up the challenge, engineers will welcome it with open arms. In the meantime,
they face a long campaign to adjust the vast bulk of existing services
either upwards to meet modern demands for efficiency, or downwards from the
inflated ideas of the 1980s.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Russian 'blue chips' in search for pioneers
 -International offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When JSC Rosneftegazstroy (RNGS), a Russian oil and gas construction
company, announced last week that it is seeking to raise Dollars 25.5m by
selling 3.7 per cent of its shares to international investors, the news did
not grab headlines.
However, in a week in which managers of five 'self-styled' blue chip Russian
companies came to London to present their businesses to potential
international investors, it provided another reminder of Russia's status as
an increasingly fashionable emerging market.
In spite of huge risks, including widespread crime and a primitive stock
market, over Dollars 500m a month in overseas money is flowing into Russian
companies, attracted by returns in some cases of several hundred per cent a
year.
Several funds, most of them launched this year, allow institutions to buy
into Russian companies, often through the over-the-counter market (which
accounts for the bulk of stock market trades). These have helped crystallise
investor interest.
Baring Asset Management hopes to launch a fund of not less than Dollars 100m
later this month, following the example of companies such as Framlington,
which raised Dollars 66m with its Framlington Russian Investment Fund last
December, and Fleming, which launched its Dollars 55m Fleming Russia
Securities Fund last month.
Hong Kong-based Regent Fund Management, which launched its Dollars 20m White
Tiger Investment Company last month, is one a number of other fund managers
keen on Russia.
The company announcing its capital-raising plans this week, RNGS, is
following in the footsteps of Gazprom, the largest gas producer in Russia.
The government two months ago appointed Kleinwort Benson to sell up to 9 per
cent of Gazprom's shares to overseas investors, either through a private
placement or international issue.
RNGS, the legal successor to the Soviet Ministry for Oil and Gas
Construction, has permission ultimately to sell 10 per cent of its shares.
Desperate for capital, many Russian companies could follow suit. Many of the
biggest are now beginning to organise their accounts and other operations
more efficiently.
Ms Beth Hebert, fund manager for the Fleming Russia Securities Fund, said
last week's 'blue chip' roadshow in London signalled a sea change in
attitudes in Russian business.
'It is not very often you get a chance to hear directly from these
companies. It is quite a change from where we were a few months ago when
people didn't even return phone calls,' she said.
CA, the Moscow-based brokerage which organised the meeting, said a number of
Russian companies are preparing to issue global depositary receipts from
January.
Ms Danielle Downing, a director of CA, said she expects Russian banks, which
are more accustomed to producing audited accounts and have relatively strong
balance sheets, to be among the first categories of companies to issue GDRs.
Later, Russia's huge utilities and energy companies could follow. Possible
candidates include United Energy System of Russia, one of the companies in
London last week, and Lukoil, the country's biggest oil company.
GDR issues may increase the acceptability of Russia to a wider spectrum of
investors, but mainstream investors are likely to remain on the sidelines
for sometime.
Mr Jim Mellon, managing director of Regent, is bullish but warns: 'This is
absolute pioneer stuff. There are bound to be disasters on the way.'

Property company shares are likely to remain a key feature of trading in the
colony this week as the sector rounds off its reporting season with the
announcement of full-year figures by Sun Hung Kai Properties on Friday,
writes Louise Lucas.
The sector took a tumble at the end of last week after Cheung Kong, the
property development company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing, announced
pre-sale prices for apartments in a New Territories development.
These proved sharply below market expectations and those of recent pricings
of similar developments.
In response, the Hang Seng index fell 1.9 per cent on Friday, wiping out the
benefit of cumulative rises seen during the four previous sessions and
leaving the market 1.2 per cent lower on the week.
This month's land auction is also expected to generate little excitement.
Share prices could continue to trend lower on concerns about the
over-heating economy in China and the poor state of Sino-British relations.
Investors will also be looking to governor Chris Patten's policy speech on
Wednesday for any signals of plans to improve co-operation between the two
governments.

Investors remain cautious over the direction of the yen and announcements of
revised interim corporate earnings, writes Emiko Terazono.
Although share prices failed to react to most of last week's upward revision
announcements, investors have not missed the opportunity to sell on downward
earnings revision releases.
While buying by public pension and insurance funds is expected to support
the 225-share Nikkei average until the listing of Japan Tobacco later this
month, a further fall of Japan Telecom could trigger selling.

The market has little in the way of results to provide focus this week.
Friday, however, will bring the listing of a SKr3bn tranche of Stadshypotek,
the country's leading provider of housing finance.
Unibank Securities says that concern over the determination of the country's
new government to implement austerity plans raises questions over the
near-term pressure on margins of the banking system as a whole.
In the longer term, the markets will focus on Stadshypotek's ability to fund
its own liabilities without state backing from January 1 1995.

With the mostly good corporate reporting season now over, the debate over
the government's budget proposals will rumble on this week.
James Capel says that the dominant issue in its European equity strategy is
one of earnings recovery, which it expects to support substantial market
advances over the next year to 18 months.
The broker forecasts a 50 per cent recovery in earnings per share in 1995 in
the Italian corporate sector, driven both by volume demand and a reduction
in variable costs.
James Capel believes that the short-term risks remain considerable and could
depress market performance further.
The heterogeneous nature of the ruling coalition and opposition from the
unions might soften the proposed budget cuts aimed at correcting the fiscal
imbalance.
The long-term outlook, with recovery in output and earnings, and a budgetary
position that was certainly better than that of Sweden, could be promising
for equity market returns, says the broker.
At present, however, it maintains the view that other European markets offer
growth prospects and value at lower risk, although individual stocks have
good growth potential.

After today's unification holiday, the market will increasingly be
influenced by opinion polls ahead of the federal election on October 16. UBS
expects a continuation of the volatility in the stock market to be combined
with a sideways trend in the run up to the polls.
On the corporate front, Allianz holds its annual meeting on Wednesday while
Thursday and Friday bring the annual meeting of the chemical association.
UBS says that volume in the domestic chemical sector was up 4 per cent in
the first half of this year.
Given that the usual seasonal downturn in the third quarter did not happen
this year, positive indications might be given for the last quarter of 1994.
August industrial production and manufacturing order figures are due on
Thursday. James Capel expects a 0.6 per cent rise in industrial production,
noting that recent rises in industrial orders point to continuing strength
in production.
It forecasts a 0.5 per cent increase in overall manufacturing orders, noting
that, encouragingly for the sustainability of the recovery, the improvement
in orders was increasingly spreading to the domestic side.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Maytag decides against
Australian flotation

Maytag, the US home appliance manufacturer, is abandoning plans to float its
Australian and New Zealand-based white goods and floor care appliance
operations.
It blamed the recent deterioration and weakness of the Australian
stockmarket, especially for new offerings, and said it could see greater
value in retaining the operations, rather divesting them 'into a down
market'.
The decision to abandon the flotation of Hoover Australia follows several
days of rumours that the sale was in trouble. Earlier in the week, there was
speculation that the price at which the shares were to be sold might have to
be cut from ADollars 1 to 85 cents because of lack of interest among
institutional investors and potential sub-underwriters.
Maytag first announced plans to sell the businesses in May, saying it would
prefer to do so by way of a stockmarket flotation. The operations were
formerly part of the Hoover group, which was taken over by Maytag in 1988.
Hoover Australia is reckoned to have about 18 per cent of the white goods
market in its home country. Analysts had expected the sale to raise between
ADollars 100m (Dollars 73m) and ADollars 150m.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Muted sighs of relief after FOMC meeting -
New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sighs of relief when the Federal Reserve decided against an immediate
credit tightening last week were muted. The leading market indices managed
to add a few points in the aftermath, but most analysts expect them to
reverse course before too long.
This week it may become more apparent why the enthusiasm of investors has
been restrained, even though few had predicted an early move by the Fed, and
not many would have welcomed one.
Interest rates are approaching a level at which the appeal of equities would
diminish, analysts say. With that in mind, the stock market is closely
tracking the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond, which is sure
to rise or fall in response to any change in monetary policy.
Most investment strategists see the 8.00 per cent level as a red flag for
equities. Late on Friday, the long bond was bid at about 7.83 per cent,
compared with 7.79 per cent before the Federal Open Market Committee's
policy-making session on Tuesday.
When the FOMC meeting ended with no statement - save a terse announcement
that the meeting had adjourned - Fed watchers were quick to put an
unfavourable spin on the form chosen by the central bank to frame its
traditional reticence.
The statement was interpreted as a signal that the FOMC had authorised Mr
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, to increase rates as soon as he sees
irrefutable evidence that the economy is growing at an unmanageable pace.
He may not have to wait very long. This week brings the most keenly watched
economic report of the month. On Friday, the Labor Department will release
September employment data which is expected by analysts to show a gain of
250,000 in non-farm payrolls.
An excessive rise may not cause Mr Greenspan to act immediately. He may want
to consider next Friday's data on industrial production before making a
decision. But a big jump in payrolls is likely to trigger an instant
reaction in the stock market, as investors anticipate what would then seem
to be inevitable.
A month earlier, Wall Street was pleasantly surprised by a payroll increase
of just 179,000, which helped lift share prices to their mid-September highs
and perhaps persuaded the FOMC to stand pat last week.
This time, however, a stronger than expected surge in August industrial
production suggests that manufacturers may have taken on more workers in
September than analysts have calculated.
Against this unfavourable backdrop, the third-quarter reporting season has
arrived. Wall Street is expecting strong results. If this week's first
arrivals fail to impress, the negative sentiment could spill over into
related stocks.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Vulnerable to fears of further tightening -
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fund managers and stockbroker analysts face an uncomfortable Monday morning.
The third quarter of 1994 has come and gone, leaving little behind in the
way of significant equity performance and with market fears of a tightening
in Federal Reserve credit policy increased by the latest data on US gross
domestic product and housing starts.
Not the best opening to a final trading quarter, which requires the UK
market to gain up to 20 per cent if it is to meet the most optimistic of
City forecasts for the FT-SE 100 Index at the year-end. With at least two
leading international investment bankers still prepared to compare October
1994 with October 1987, even if they do finally reject the comparison, it is
not surprising that some nervousness is creeping into analysts' forecasts.
SG Warburg has taken the plunge and cut its year-end Footsie forecast from
3,500 to 3,250 - 'a more plausible central assumption', says the Warburg
strategy team, in view of the absence of significant recovery of confidence
in global bond markets. For Footsie 3,500, Warburg says we will all have to
wait until December 1995; no comfort at all to those houses still holding
firm to this target for the end of this year.
Rising bond yields have returned to haunt the UK stock market, perhaps even
surpassing corporate earnings uncertainty as a governing influence.
Kleinwort Benson Securities sees the London equity market as particularly
vulnerable, and has cut the UK weighting of its recommended equity
allocation from 12 to 10 per cent.
Kleinwort is keen on cash (10 per cent recommended), a view that found
favour last week with some fund managers, who decided trustees might be
impressed if they sold UK equities even if returns on cash are not
impressive.
Leanings towards cash are echoed by UBS in its comparison of the present
market scenario with that of 1987. It rejects any suggestions of a major
disaster, but says that worries over equity valuations, a weak US currency
and high real interest rates could drive investors to the short end of
global government bond markets.
Goldman Sachs, the other house to refer back to 1987, also says 'short-term
oriented investors might usefully boost their cash holdings'. For the medium
term, Goldman is optimistic on equities, believing that US economic recovery
will last at least into 1966.
Nor are these uncertainties mere long-range views. The UK stock market has
proved itself still highly vulnerable to fears of further tightening in
global credit policies. This Friday's announcement of US payroll data,
expected to be strong, could trigger a further aggressive tightening by the
Fed, 'not just in October but subsequently', according to Kleinwort.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Banks lending to companies at
less than cost of capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The excess of capital in the banking system is leading to banks lending
money to large companies on terms which only cover 'a modest proportion' of
the cost of capital, according to a leading banker.
Mr David Harrison, the senior general manager for corporate banking at
Lloyds Bank, said that credit losses in the early 1990s had 'to be regarded
as once in a lifetime acts of God' to justify recent loan pricing.
Mr Harrison told the Financial Times conference on international banking in
Madrid that there were, nonetheless, trends in corporate banking which
allowed Lloyds to maintain its commitment to the activity.
These included the chance of forming partnerships with customers to design
tailored products, such as cash management systems, which banks could then
offer to a wider market knowing that they had been tested.
He defended the use of overdrafts by UK companies despite supervisory calls
for longer-term finance. 'With luck, the atmosphere will improve as the
recession recedes - the overdraft is too useful to be abandoned,' he said.
Mr Onno Ruding, vice-chairman of Citicorp, said that monetary union in
Europe was 'not dead, but carries a serious possibility of being implemented
around the year 2000' by five or six EU members.
However, technical factors such as the need for banks to have five years'
warning of the introduction of a single currency meant that the original
Maastricht Treaty timetable of full union by 1999 was unrealistic.
He said that retail banks would bear substantial costs of adaptation, but
the main revenue losses would be felt by wholesale banks, which would suffer
a loss of income from intra-European currency exchange.
Mr Isamu Koike, managing director of the Industrial Bank of Japan, said that
Japanese bankers were more confident that they had identified the size of
bad debts stemming from the 'bubble' economy.
Mr Koike said that the Dollars 136bn of non-performing loans held by the 21
largest banks would 'not be resolved overnight' but Japanese banks' earning
capacity should enable them to recover without government intervention.

Economic data due in the coming days will determine whether the Federal
Reserve was right not to raise interest rates again last week, or whether it
has taken too sanguine a view on inflation.
September's employment report, which is due on Friday, is widely expected to
show a pick-up in employment growth from the relatively low level of August.
However, at a predicted 230,000 to 300,000, the increase in non-farm
payrolls may not be the figure the bond market watches most closely.
A fall in the unemployment rate to below 6 per cent (it was 6.1 per cent in
August) would prove more damaging to fixed income prices.
Among other figures the markets will have to chew on this week will be
September's NAPM index, published today. After the decline in August to
56.2, this barometer of purchasing managers' activity is expected to bounce
back to anything from 56.5 to 57.
Evidence of faster economic growth would suggest that the Federal Reserve
was wrong not to act pre-emptively to raise rates, and leave it in the
unenviable position of having to act ahead of its next policy-making
meeting, in November.
However, at 7.8 per cent - up from around 7.4 per cent a month ago - the
yield on long-dated bonds may already have anticipated much of the bad news.

FT  03 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Denmark seen as better risk than Sweden
 -Capital &amp; Credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the elections out of the way, a major risk factor for Swedish and
Danish government bonds has been removed.
However, following the establishment of minority governments in both
countries and ahead of the Finnish and Swedish referenda on European Union
membership, these markets are likely to remain volatile in coming months.
Still, commitment to fiscal discipline by the new governments in both
countries, accompanied by continued economic recovery, is likely to support
both markets in 1995.
Of the two, Denmark is widely seen to offer better prospects. 'Denmark's
hard-core credentials are strong, but its bond yields are not in line with
hard-core markets,' says Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at SG
Warburg Securities. 'Of all the convergence trades in Europe, Danish bonds
seem to have the most solid credentials.'
With the budget deficit in decline, the economy growing steadily while
inflation remains relatively subdued, Denmark's 'fundamental position would
indicate an outperformance of bunds,' agrees Mr Paul Donovan, analyst at
UBS.
Danish bond yields rose sharply this year, largely on fears that the
country's stronger than expected growth would fuel inflationary pressures.
As a result, the yield spread over German bonds widened as far as 172 basis
points in early September.
It has narrowed considerably since then, however, partly due to rising
German yields after strong economic data there, and partly to a reassessment
of Denmark's fundamentals. On Friday, the Danish 10-year benchmark bond
yielded 9.03 per cent, some 140 basis points over its German equivalent.
'Denmark's position at the vanguard of the European economic cycle has been
supplanted,' says Mr Juckes. 'Its economy is growing in line with those in
the rest of hard-core Europe.' He expects the Danish yield spread over
Germany to converge to 100 basis points during the first half of 1995.
The minority government is also unlikely to be a problem, given that this
form of government has become much the norm in Denmark. The centre-left
coalition is expected to seek support on its economic policies from the
right wing in parliament, and is unlikely to bow to pressure from the
far-left, analysts say.
The main risk to the Danish market is likely to come from external sources.
Despite the favourable domestic economic climate, uncertainty over Sweden's
political situation and the post-election handling of Sweden's deficits may
have a spill-over effect, warns Ms Cathy Savage, of Nomura.
'It also seems likely that, despite being firmly rooted within the EU
itself, the uncertainty over whether Finland, Sweden and Norway will vote in
favour of EU membership is having an impact as a background 'confidence'
issue for Denmark,' she adds.
In Sweden, the outlook is more murky and it may take a while before
investors regain confidence in the bond market.
Recent years have seen a sharp increase in the budget deficit and
public-sector debt, resulting largely from the country's deep recession.
However, economic recovery and a package of spending cuts and tax rises
announced by the Social Democrats are hoped to break the circle which has
undermined the currency and pushed yields higher this year.
Swedish 10-year yields rose to 12.05 per cent in August, from a low of 6.65
in January, with the spread over bunds widening as far as 494 basis points.
On Friday, the yield was back at 11.17 per cent and the spread stood at 354
basis points but analysts warn that the market will remain vulnerable to
further setbacks in coming months.
'We're not very bullish on the market near-term - there is so much
uncertainty,' says Mr Allen Owie, senior analyst at Unibank Securities in
Copenhagen.
On Friday, the government is due to unveil its economic policy programme; in
mid-October, a new central-bank supervisory board and governor are to be
appointed, creating uncertainty over the Riksbank's monetary policy stance;
and in January the 1995 budget will be unveiled.
Before the budget debate heats up, however, Sweden's referendum on EU
membership on November 13 will take centre stage, following the Finnish EU
vote on October 16.
A positive EU vote would have a very positive effect on the bond market, Mr
Owie says. 'If Sweden agrees to EU membership, its economic policy framework
will be dictated by external factors, which is very bullish in the longer
term.'
Another risk is a possible rating move by Moody's, the US agency. While
Standard &amp; Poor's recently affirmed its AA+ rating, fears of a downgrading
by Moody's later in the year has scared the market.
If the EU referendum yields a 'yes,' Moody's leaves its Aa2 rating unchanged
and the government produces a fiscally austere budget package, Swedish bonds
could be in for a rally in early 1995, Mr Donovan predicts. Until then,
however, investors will be in for a bumpy ride.

The election effect, which prompted a sharp correction in the Frankfurt
stock market last week, with a clear knock-on into bonds on Friday, is
expected to dominate sentiment in the German financial markets, at least
until the federal polls on October 16.
If future opinion samplings confirm the tendency thrown up by the latest
Forsa survey, which was published on Friday and showed the Social
Democrat/Green alliance with the advantage, then market sentiment may be
deeply depressed.
The Forsa results showed the liberal Free Democrats, junior partners in
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition, with insufficient support to gain
seats in the Bundestag.
Politics apart, the usual fundamental factors affecting bonds are continuing
to improve. Provisional September inflation figures for west Germany showed
prices behaving themselves.
A 2 per cent pay rise for clothing industry workers and flexible working
arrangements, announced on Friday, was also encouraging for the longer-term
price perspective, although textiles is a particularly depressed sector and
expectations were low.
August industrial output fell sharply, because of unquantifiable holiday
effects, but confidence in the recovery remains intact among most industrial
leaders.

FT  03 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Europe to remain in the doldrums -
International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM BOWLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dramatic reversal in sentiment in world government bond markets this
year has had an equally dramatic impact on the pattern of new issuance in
the eurobond markets.
While new issuance of fixed-rate eurobonds and of eurobonds denominated in
most European currencies has withered in this year's difficult market
conditions, yen-denominated bonds, medium-term notes and floating-rate notes
have all flourished.
According to data supplied by Euromoney Bondware, the volume of new eurobond
issues in the first nine months of 1994 totalled an equivalent of Dollars
282.8bn, down from Dollars 304.4bn in the same period last year, although
still ahead of the Dollars 212.5bn of the first nine months of 1992.
Within that total, however, the volume of fixed-rate new issues fell by
Dollars 47.8bn to Dollars 185.9bn, a victim of expectations of higher
inflation and the turn upwards in world interest rates.
The reverse side of this trend downwards in fixed-rate issues has been an
explosion of growth in floating-rate notes. FRN issuance totalled an
equivalent of Dollars 76.4bn between January and September this year,
compared with Dollars 49.7bn in the first nine months of last year.
FRNs offer variable rates of interest which move to reflect changes in
short-term money market interest rates. They have, therefore, provided
investors with a degree of protection in this year's rising interest rate
environment.
Probably the most startling trend, in this year's bear market, however, has
been the rise in the volume of eurobonds denominated in yen. With the yen
appreciating against the US dollar and with exceptional volatility in
European bond markets, Japanese investors have concentrated on their own
currency sector. The result has been a 50 per cent increase in
yen-denominated issues, to Dollars 46.9bn in the first nine months of 1994.
The Italian lira is another currency sector which has returned to favour
this year. The equivalent of Dollars 13.9bn worth of new eurolira bonds were
issued between January and September of this year, compared with Dollars
10bn worth over the same period in 1993. After sharp falls in Italian
government bond prices earlier in the year, the market has again stabilised
in recent months.
Other European currency sectors have experienced sharp falls in eurobond
issuance as demand has evaporated at the prospect of higher inflation and
rising short-term official interest.
In the D-Mark sector, the equivalent of Dollars 22.2bn worth of eurobonds
was issued in the first nine months of this year, against Dollars 41.3bn in
the same period last year.
The sterling sector, which saw the first rise in official short-term
interest rates last month, saw issuance between January and September of
Dollars 25.9bn, against Dollars 35.8bn in the same period of 1993.
Of the top eurobond houses, Merrill Lynch seems to have been the most
successful in coping with these difficult and changing market conditions.
It lead-managed the equivalent of Dollars 27.9bn worth of eurobonds between
January and September, an almost 10 per cent market share, compared with
Dollars 12.73bn, or about 4 per cent of market share, at the same stage last
year.
The direction the eurobond markets will take over the remaining months of
1994 is not clear. Whether the yen sector remains in vogue will depend, in
part, on the performance of the yen against the dollar.
With European interest rates headed upwards, however, European currency
sectors will likely remain in the doldrums, while FRNs can look forward to
continued popularity.

In spite of the recent volatility in the European and US financial markets,
gilts maintained a relatively firm tone last week, shrugging off many of the
broader swings in the UK equities and futures markets. Many analysts expect
this trend to continue this week.
'It's likely to be a week of consolidation,' says Ms Katy Peters, senior
economist at Daiwa Europe.
She points out that in the last week a stronger trend in the German bund
market coupled with a successful gilt auction has supported the market
slightly.
'The supply side story has been unwinding and that is helping it a bit,' she
adds.
Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg says: 'The recent switching into gilts from
equities hints at good underlying demand.'
In the absence of the release of any important domestic data this week, one
factor that could potentially affect the markets is any aftermath from the
Japanese-US trade talks.
Some dealers fear that the compromise hammered out in the talks could yet
unravel, triggering a fresh bout of international bond market instability.
However on the domestic side, the M0 money supply data today, and output
figures later this week, are not expected to have a strong market impact.

Although bond prices were supported by lower short-term money market rates
and the sluggish stock market in the first half of last week, earlier gains
were eroded by the release of stronger than expected industrial production
figures on Thursday.
This week, government bonds are expected to fluctuate in a narrow range.
While weak stock prices and buying by public funds are likely to support the
market, cautiousness over the speed of economic recovery is likely to weigh
on prices.
Meanwhile, a stronger yen could briefly prop up investor confidence. The
rejection of calls to stop the yen's further rise by Mr Masayoshi Takemura,
the Japanese finance minister, by other countries at the Group of Seven
summit last weekend, is likely to encourage buying of the currency.
Aside from keeping import inflation lower, a higher yen has negative
implications for corporate earnings, so may also hurt the stock market.
Investment flow data for August, to be released this week with August
current account figures, will provide some indication of the course of the
yen. Foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese equities in July for the
first time since June last year and are expected to have sustained the
selling in August, which could cap the yen's appreciation.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Fillip for Caribbean cross-border trade -
The Emerging Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cross-border trading in the Caribbean, which has been sluggish since it
started in 1991, should get some encouragement from the decision of CIBC
(Canada), the commercial banking group, to offer for sale 45m shares in CIBC
West Indies Holdings, its Caribbean subsidiary.
The offer, which opened on Monday September 19, will close on Thursday
October 6, and is valued at Dollars 24.5m.
The hopes for increased cross-border trading have been raised by the
decision of CIBC to make the share offer simultaneously in six Caribbean
countries - Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica, St Lucia, St Vincent and Trinidad
and Tobago. The shares will be listed on the three Caribbean Community
(Caricom) stock exchanges in Barbados, Jamaica and Trinidad. It is these
three which are at the core of the nascent regional stock market.
'This is a move in the right direction,' says Mr Wain Iton, manager of the
Jamaica Stock Exchange. 'It is the first genuinely regional public offer. We
may not get the robust cross-border trading that we all wish for, but it
sets the stage for other companies in the region to recognise that an entire
capital market in the region is available.'
This assessment is shared by Mr Hugh Edwards, manager of the Trinidad and
Tobago Stock Exchange. 'With CIBC coming to the market with an offer spread
out over six Caribbean countries,' he says, 'this should add some impetus to
the countries without stock exchanges to begin buying and selling shares.'
Cross-border trading is part of a wider effort by the members of the
Caribbean Community to integrate their economies and prepare the ground for
a planned common market and monetary union. 'This offer by CIBC will
certainly open the opportunities for other companies to try similar
placements simultaneously in several Caribbean states,' says Mr Basil Buck,
president of Buck Securities, Jamaican stockbrokers. 'There are many
companies which are well placed to do this, with subsidiaries and branches
in several Caribbean states.
'The CIBC offer will also stimulate the efforts at cross-border trading
which has been in the doldrums for many months,' adds Mr Buck.
Caribbean brokers have argued repeatedly that there is potential for vibrant
cross-border trading and the development of the regional stock exchange; the
three markets list an aggregate of 110 companies with a combined
capitalisation of Dollars 2.41bn.
They have also suggested that closer ties be established with the exchange
in the Dominican Republic. Guyana is planning to establish a stock market,
as is the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, a grouping of seven
islands with a common currency.
The offer by CIBC (Canada) represents about a quarter of the shares of its
Caribbean subsidiary, which is incorporated in Barbados and which is the
holding company for the bank's operations in Barbados and other islands in
the eastern Caribbean.
It also has a marginal majority stake in CIBC Jamaica and a 4 per cent
holding in Republic Bank, the largest in Trinidad and Tobago. CIBC's
Bahamian business is soon to be managed by CIBC West Indies Holdings.
'The Caribbean is a very thin market with a lot of cash and very little to
invest in,' says Mr Shastrie Ablack, managing director of CIBC West Indies
Holdings. A minimum sale volume of 30m shares will make the offer a
successful one, he adds.
Hopes for a more active cross-border market have been depressed by periods
of economic difficulty and uncertainty in some Caribbean economies. A very
volatile foreign exchange market in Jamaica, and high inflation which has
affected the financial services market (there is currently no activity in
the bond market), accompanied by currency instability, have compounded
changes in exchange rates in Trinidad and Tobago and rumours of an impending
devaluation in Barbados.
The majority of individual investors in Caribbean stocks, and some small
institutional ones as well, tend to use their shares as longer term
investments rather than looking for opportunities for buying and selling,
consequently reducing the vibrancy of the regional markets, according to
brokers.
'The success of this offer will determine the degree of vitality it will add
to cross-border trading, and there is at least one other company which is
watching this and which is likely to make an offer spread over a similar
area,' says Mr Edwards.
Regional investors in the CIBC West Indies Holdings offer will be able to
indulge in arbitrage on the secondary market by, for example, buying low in
Trinidad and selling high in Jamaica. Prices on the three markets may not
always be in balance.
The effort at cross-border trading is still bedevilled, however, by problems
in the manner and speed of settlements. Since none of the currencies used by
the three exchanges is convertible, settlements are being done through what
Mr Iton describes as 'a cost inefficient method.'
'We are settling in US dollars through a third party in New York,' he
explained. 'There is, however, the prospect of us using the network of one
of the regional banks.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Payroll figures hold the key to rates -
Currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The start of this week's trading on the foreign exchange markets is likely
to be dominated by reaction to Saturday's partial deal on US-Japan trade
talks. But by the end of the week, attention will turn to Friday's US
non-farm payroll figures, which some feel may push the Federal Reserve into
increasing interest rates.
Although the dollar responded well on Friday to rumours of a trade deal,
analysts do not expect the US currency to gain much in the long term from a
partial agreement. Economic fundamentals will have a greater impact on the
Japan trade surplus, which many believe is the reason for the continued
strength of the yen.
The non-farm payroll numbers are expected to be strong, with a Reuters poll
of economists showing an increase of 250,000 in September, accompanied by a
drop in the unemployment rate to 6 per cent.
The latter figure is seen by some academic economists as equivalent to 'full
employment' and accordingly analysts believe the numbers may underpin a
tightening of policy by the Fed, which decided not to raise rates last week.
If the Fed does not raise rates after Friday's numbers, attention will
switch to next week's producer and consumer prices data.
Even if the Fed does raise rates, however, it is far from clear that this
will be beneficial for the dollar. Exchange rate movements this year seem to
have been governed by trends in the bond market, rather than short rates.
To date, the Fed's tightening moves have shown little sign of convincing
bond investors that the inflation threat has been eradicated.
The dollar may have some scope to strengthen against the D-Mark in the
run-up to the October 16 German general election. Traders will con-centrate
on the prospects for Chan-cellor Kohl's coalition partner, the FDP, which is
struggling to get the 5 per cent it needs to return to Parliament.
Sterling was on the sidelines for much of last week and this week's economic
data is unlikely to have much of an impact on the pound, analysts say.
However, Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe)
thinks the pound is due for a period of strength.
'By raising base rates by half a point on September 12, well ahead of a
deterioration of either the trade account or inflation, the UK authorities
have broken with the pattern of the past and severed the comparison with US
monetary policy,' he says.
Mr Persaud expects the pound to break through the Dollars 1.60 level by the
end of the year.

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Markets: Rubber pact flexibility needed - Commodities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rubber producers will be looking for concessions from consumers as the
latest round of talks on a new Inter-national Natural Rubber Agreement get
under way in Geneva today.
Representatives of Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, which produce more than
80 per cent of the world's rubber, told the Reuters news agency last week
that consumers would need to make compromises to ensure a new pact was
successfully concluded in the interests of both sides.
The world's three top producers said that they were cautiously optimistic
that the two-week meeting, under the aegis of the UN Conference on Trade and
Development, would be successful.
European rubber consuming countries said meanwhile that they supported plans
for a new pact but warned that they had limited room for compromise.
'Everybody wants to finish,' a consumer delegate told Reuters, '. . . the
issues are very simple. But we won't make any concessions that bear in them
the chance that this pact might fail later.'
Inra aims to stabilise rubber prices through the operation of a buffer stock
buying and selling system.
Following a recent surge to 6 1/2 -year highs on increased Chinese demand,
cuts in Thai and Malaysian supplies and speculative buying, producers are
calling for the reference price, which controls the levels at which the
buffer stock manager can buy or sell, to be raised by 5 to 12 per cent from
the 196.84 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilogram level it was fixed at in
February 1993.
But consumers say the rise, if any, should be no more than 4 per cent.
'(Support) Prices have to move with the long-term trend,' one said.
A commodity trade expert commented: 'Delegates are always influenced by the
recent prices, but they should really be looking to the period 1996 onwards
for five or seven years . . . That is the relevant period they are trying to
stabilise and they will have to justify their results at home.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Markets: Commodities, the vexing exception - The Global
Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a pretty lousy year for conventional investors. Bond markets
have collapsed: equities, as measured by the FT-A World Index, are up just 5
per cent. Even gold has gone nowhere, having started the year at Dollars 391
an ounce and risen to just Dollars 396. The vexing exception has been
commodities: not oil or precious metals, but boring old copper, rubber and
soyabeans. The Economist commodity index is up some 40 per cent since
January. The smart fund manager would not have spent his time shuffling
paper assets. He would have rented a warehouse on the Rotterdam docks and
filled it to the roof.
Commodities are mostly regarded these days less as an opportunity than a
threat. They are a harbinger of inflation, and thus bad news for other types
of asset. Given the historical evidence, this is not unreasonable. The bond
markets are a distinctly fallible guide to future inflation; sometimes they
overplay it, sometimes underplay it, sometimes get it wrong entirely.
Commodities, on the other hand, are not so much a guide to inflation as a
component of it.
How big a component is another matter. As the accompanying charts remind us,
there have been three surges in world inflation since the early 1970s: in
1973-4, 1979-80 and 1987-90. In each case commodities (measured by the IMF
index, which gives a longer series) started moving several months in
advance. But there were also two subsidiary blips in inflation, in 1976-77
and 1983-84. In each case the commodities index jumped sharply, even though
the underlying trend in inflation was still downwards. The 40 per cent rise
in the Economist index thus poses an obvious question: is it forecasting a
surge or a blip?
In one important sense, this rise is abnormal. It began not at the start of
the year, but the previous spring. Despite that, the rise in retail prices
in the developed world is still subdued and uncertain. This implies an
historically unusual reluctance by consumers to pay higher prices. Several
reasons can be advanced for this: in particular, the revolution in working
practices throughout the developed world, which has created an
unpreceden-ted sense of job insecurity at all levels of society.
Whatever the cause, this phenomenon implies in turn a squeeze on
manufacturers' profit margins. There is anecdotal support for this: the tyre
manufacturer able to raise prices by only 5 per cent in the face of a
soaring rubber price, the food company faced with a 50 per cent rise in the
nut price and unable to charge more for a packet of roasted peanuts, and -
at the lunatic end of the scale - UK newspaper proprietors slashing their
prices in response to a jump in the cost of newsprint.
This situation can only be finally resolved in one of two ways: either
consumers agree to pay more, or manufacturers are forced to pay less. If the
former, central bankers will be confirmed in their suspicions of reviving
inflation and will jack up interest rates. So much the worse for commodities
as a non-interest bearing investment. If the latter, so much the worse for
commodities again.
The choice between these two options cannot easily be resolved. Indeed, it
might be termed the dominant theme for investment in the mid 1990s. The
original upsurge of inflation in the developed world can be set down to
various causes: the Vietnam war, the collapse of Bretton Woods, the first
oil shock of 1973.
There is no clear explanation of why inflation should then have remained
endemic for over 20 years.
Without knowing why the phenomenon was there in the first place, it is hard
to be confident that it has gone away.
Let us suppose that the dragon of inflation is indeed loose again.
In that case, commodities might be expected to do well in the short run. But
since they have done spectacularly well now for 18 months, it is worth
recalling their record over the longer haul.
Since the beginnings of inflation in the early 1970s, retail prices
worldwide have gone up fivefold and commodities threefold.
Equities have gone up by a factor of six: they have also, of course,
provided an inflation-proof stream of income in the form of dividends.
The fact that commodities have done so dismally compared to equities is
hardly surprising.
The whole thrust of advanced economies is away from basic materials and
towards services and added value. First IBM overhauls US Steel, then
Microsoft overhauls IBM. In the whole scheme of things, raw materials are
becoming less and less important. This in itself should stand as a warning
to investors.
Commodities may lag behind the world economy in their sum of value, but
global savings do not. It follows that as a home for investment, commodities
become progressively less and less liquid: and that any attempt by investors
to switch into them in size is more and more likely to lead to speculative
excess.
How far this is happening now is not easy to determine. Even manufacturers,
who buy commodities for their primary purpose of consumption, can only talk
anecdotally about a degree of speculative pressure. But an unusual shift of
portfolio funds into commodities in the past year would go some way to
explaining the apparent paradox whereby commodity producers have been able
to push through price increases which their customers know they cannot pass
on.
With or without the return of inflation, this suggests that rather a risky
bubble may have developed in the commodities markets.
Only last week Goldman Sachs, the all-powerful US investment bank, sent a
bullish circular to its clients entitled 'The Case for Commodities'. You
have been warned.

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Markets: The Chinese superlative - Economics Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Think of China and you are thinking in superlatives. It is the world's most
populous country, with 1.2bn people. Its economy grew at an average annual
rate of 9 per cent in the 15 years to 1993. In the past two years alone, it
grew by a quarter because of double digit growth in 1992 and 1993.
As the chart shows, China attracted well over Dollars 20bn in foreign direct
investment last year and, according to the International Monetary Fund, is
the largest single recipient of foreign direct investment in the developing
world. It was also the biggest single borrower from the World Bank in its
past financial year.
But when it comes to managing change through economic and financial policy,
the Chinese authorities shy away from the big bang approach. A study of the
growth of capital markets in China*, produced by an IMF staff team under
Morris Goldstein, deputy director of the Fund's research department, has
found that the Chinese moved ahead a step at a time. They introduced capital
markets on an experimental basis, hoping to learn from experience, and made
sure that change came gradually and incrementally.
While the development of Chinese capital markets is still in its early
stages, the study predicts that their growth 'will rank as one of the
important financial events of the 1990s.'
The Fund suggests that China's experience could have some lessons for other
countries making the difficult transformation from communist state planning
to a market economy.
More important, the IMF believes China is gaining many advantages from
capital market development. More is involved than simply raising finance.
China's emerging capital markets are 'best viewed as part of the cutting
edge of the reform process,' the Fund says.
Securities markets can provide China with a means to absorb international
financial techniques and practices. The listing of a company's stock on an
exchange helps good corporate governance by creating a system of discipline
for companies that is independent of bureaucrats. The development of
securities markets can speed deregulation by increasing pressure for
de-control in other areas of finance. For example, once savers get used to
market-determined yields through equity investment, there will be pressure
to boost the rates of return on other assets.
The spread of equity in China has been rapid.
Although the first recognised stock exchange only opened in Shanghai in
December 1990, the IMF reports that the value of equities listed on the
Shanghai and Shenzen stock exchanges had reached Dollars 40bn at the end of
last year - equivalent in value to the Argentine or Turkish markets. In
October last year, a Chinese company was listed on the New York Stock
Exchange for the first time. More than 4,000 companies are said to have
issued unlisted shares that are traded informally in kerb markets in Chinese
cities.
Equities are only a small part of the China's capital market renaissance,
however. The chart shows how new issues of all securities, including bonds,
certificates of deposit and shares, have mushroomed in recent years.
Issues and issuers have become more varied. Financial futures have been
introduced over the past two years. In 1991, the most recent year for which
figures are available, issues of bonds by financial institutions and
enterprises soared.
But the IMF reports that the authorities have followed rather than led this
feverish activity. Official approval for the issue of securities by
enterprises was only given after many had issued securities on their own
initiative. Similarly, securities were traded on the Shanghai and Shenzen
stock exchanges long before they were officially opened in 1990 and 1991.
It might be thought that the Fund would react with some horror to this state
of affairs. But instead, the attitude of the report seems be that 'it may
look funny but it works'.
The IMF clearly sympathises with recent temporary retrenchments in the
process of liberalisation after activity in China's financial markets ran
ahead of the authorities' intentions.
It even gives qualified approval to the practice of the Chinese authorities
of picking which companies will issue shares on regulated exchanges. This
looks a funny way to create a market-based economy, but the Fund is willing
to tolerate the system so long as the authorities are not motivated by
non-economic issues such as the desire to spread listings geographically.
Indeed, the Fund's detailed analysis of China's emerging capital markets may
tell us as much about the IMF as about China. It shows that the IMF's
pin-striped economists can be pragmatists after all.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Market gives Ebner first round
in battle for UBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prices of the bearer and registered shares of Union Bank of Switzerland
displayed rare volatility on Friday as investors struggled to guess the
outcome of the war that had just been declared between the directors of one
of the world's most highly respected banks and Mr Martin Ebner, a little
known Zurich broker-fund manager.
At the close, the market seemed to be backing Mr Ebner, no small tribute to
the immense resources and influence this intense man has accumulated since
setting up his BZ banking group nine years ago. However, the unavoidable
final showdown at a UBS extraordinary general meeting on November 22 is
still seven weeks away.
The main issue is whether a group of shareholders representing only a
minority of the capital should be able to control the board. But the battle
is also part of an ongoing struggle between an old, self-serving Swiss
financial establishment and a new generation of asset managers who want
better performance from their Swiss investments.
And it is a personal confrontation between Mr Nikolaus Senn, the garrulous
UBS chairman who cannot conceal his distaste for a cheeky upstart, and a
successful outsider who resents the posturings of someone whose stewardship
of Switzerland's largest bank has been undistinguished.
Mr Ebner's interest in UBS dates from 1991, when he launched BK Vision to
invest in financial equities. It was apparently set up in part to
accommodate the wish of some of his clients to shift their less liquid
holdings.
UBS registered shares suffered from a small float and a restriction
permitting only Swiss nationals to vote them, and traded at a substantial
discount to the bearers. From the start, these securities have been among BK
Vision's largest holdings.
Mr Ebner made clear that BK would be an active shareholder - nudging
directors towards greater transparency and sensitivity to shareholders - and
has been particularly aggressive in needling UBS.
In its latest dig, BK Vision put a motion on the UBS AGM agenda in the
spring proposing that the number of board members be reduced from 22 to a
maximum of nine. Mr Senn resisted it with a farrago of pretentious arguments
about UBS's responsibility for the whole Swiss economy and, armed with the
usual fistful of proxies, he carried the day.
But Mr Ebner, to his immense surprise, attracted some 40 per cent of the
votes, and it now looks as if he interpreted this support as a wider mandate
to challenge the bank's basic policies.
According to Mr Senn, Mr Ebner told him he was trying to corral a majority
of the votes with a view to installing a new board at the next annual
general meeting and directing UBS to abandon its universal strategy and
concentrate instead on investment banking and asset management.
As UBS has a market capitalisation of over SFr30bn, it would normally be
extremely difficult for anyone to accumulate enough votes for such a cause,
especially as the bank's performance, while mediocre, is not distressing.
But those registered shares that BK Vision holds have five times the voting
power of bearers.
Claiming it would be unfair for investors representing only a minority of
its capital to take control, the UBS board last Thursday proposed splits of
both the bearer and registered shares, giving them equal voting power. The
registered shareholders' aggregate voting power would fall from 50 per cent
to 20 per cent, in line with their capital commitment.
Predictably, BK Vision cried foul, saying the bank would take away the
registered shareholders' property rights without compensation. The
registered shares have been trading at a substantial effective premium to
the bearers in the past few months, but only because Mr Ebner and his allies
have been buying them.
Mr Ebner is on stronger ground when he argues that his goal is to focus the
bank's efforts on profitability, which he says is in the interest of all
shareholders.
UBS directors face a tough struggle. They must win two-thirds of the votes
at the EGM plus a majority from each share class. That means they must
convince many Swiss registered shareholders, including UBS employees, it is
in their interest to see those shares lose a quarter of their value.
If investors thought UBS was going to win, the premium on the registered
shares should have disappeared on Friday. But at the close, it still stood
at 26 per cent.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: MIM sale cuts ties with Cominco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Queensland-based metals group, has sold its remaining 8.65
per cent holding in Cominco, the North American mining and smelting group,
for CDollars 164.9m (USDollars 123m).
The sale cuts all shareholding ties between the two companies and ends an
ambitious international base-metals alliance which was stitched together
during the 1980s by MIM, Germany's Metallgesellschaft and Teck Corp of
Vancouver.
Earlier this year, MIM sold its half share in Nunachiaq, a private
investment company, to Teck for CDollars 139.7m. Nunachiaq's principal
assets included a 27.7 per cent holding in Cominco, as well as a 22.46 per
cent interest in the Polaris zinc-lead mine joint venture.
Metallgesellschaft earlier this month sold the bulk of its international
mining assets, including indirect stakes in Teck and Cominco, with the
disposal of a controlling stake in Metall Mining of Toronto.
In the case of the latest Cominco sale, MIM said that the shares had been
''broadly distributed' among investors on a block trade basis at CDollars 24
a share. The disposal of the 6.87m shares will generate a CDollars 11m
profit before tax for MIM's Canadian subsidiary.

Torino reports net profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest banking group,
reported a net profit in the first half of L203bn, almost the same as last
year, but operating profits fell by 21 per cent to L862bn.
San Paolo has been affected, like all Italian banks, by pressure on interest
margins and paper losses on its investment portfolio, compared with the
favourable conditions of the first six months of last year.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: First results for Ina since
privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ina, the Italian insurance company, reported parent company pre-tax profits
of L250bn (Dollars 160m) for the first half of 1994, in its first results
since June, when the Italian treasury privatised 51 per cent of the company.
Comparison with last year's figures is misleading, because until October
1993 Ina benefited from compulsory contributions from other Italian
insurers, but the company pointed out that in the whole of 1993, its pre-tax
profit amounted to only L274bn.
Group premium income reached L2,970bn, up 12.8 per cent on the equivalent
period, L1,218bn from life activities, and L1,752bn from non-life.

The board of Aeromexico, Mexico's largest airline carrier, is investigating
alleged financial irregularities by the former management of the company
that may prevent it from covering some of its financial obligations, writes
Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Shareholders were informed that Dollars 50m of company funds could not be
accessed, because of possible 'irregular conduct' involving the alleged use
of the money as collateral to buy shares or receive a loan.
A senior government official confirmed that the authorities were looking
into alleged illegal use of the company's funds by previous management.
The announcement follows last month's resignation of Mr Gerardo Prevoisin,
the former chief executive. Mr Prevoisin had been unable to reach agreement
with banks over rescheduling of debt of Mexicana, the airline that
Aeromexico took over last year.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Hoechst plans big restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's Hoechst chemicals group is to sweep away its antiquated,
centralised management and operational structure in the most ambitious
shake-out ordered so far by Mr Jurgen Dormann, the new chairman.
The changes, effective from January 1, will reduce the number of operating
divisions from 15 to seven and transfer responsibility for divisional
strategy and profits to their managers, the company said.
This will leave the main board free to concentrate on group strategy,
supported by a central administration comprising about 200 people.
Previously centralised responsibilities for factories and departmental
functions are to be passed down to individual divisional managements.
'We need more entrepreneurial initiative, market and customer orientation
and greater flexibility,' the group said in a notice to staff. The current
structure was 'a fine-meshed net, trapping and considerably delaying
decisions, business processes, customer demands and change,' it added.
Mr Dormann, who took charge in May, said recession had exposed structural
weaknesses in the group which had not yet been repaired. It could not allow
itself to fall into such a situation again, he said, recalling that it had
been forced to close more than 20 German fine chemicals plants during the
recent slump.
Mr Dormann warned that decentralisation did not mean operating divisions
could allow themselves the luxury of heavy overheads.
'It is the job of divisional chiefs to keep their structures lean or slim
them even further,' he said.
Under the plan, future operating divisions will comprise chemicals, special
chemicals, fibres, plastics and film, engineering plastics, pharmaceuticals
and diagnostics.
The number of business units, covering distribution, packaging and other
functions, will also be cut from 120 to about 30, while subsidiaries, such
as Schwarzkopf personal care, Uhde plant construction, Herberts coating and
paints and Messer Griesheim industrial gases, will be run as independent
companies.
The possibility of merging central engineering services into Uhde is
currently under investigation.
The move will destroy the pyramid structure commonly found in many German
groups - with most decisions being made at the apex - and replace it with a
flatter hierarchy in the modern Anglo-American style.
It follows specific restructuring measures, such as the consolidation of
global fibres operations into one division now controlled out of the US.
The healthcare business recently announced closer integration of its French
subsidiary, Roussel Uclaf, into other pharmaceuticals operations.
Mr Jean-Pierre Godard, drugs chief, said the aim was to cut out duplication
in research and manufacturing and increase gross operating margins,
currently about 10 per cent of sales, to 14 per cent within three years.
Including a reduction of 800 in the workforce, the rationalisation measures
are expected to save the group DM200m (Dollars 129m) a year, Mr Godard said.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: BHF-Bank hit by bond market
downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHF-Bank has announced flat operating profits for the first eight months of
1994 as a result of the downturn in world bond markets and higher risk
provisions, but said recently announced restructuring plans should lead to a
big rise in eventual profitability.
Group operating profits totalled DM202m (Dollars 131m), a drop of 0.1 per
cent on the first eight months of 1993. Compared with eight-twelfths of last
year's total - the usual comparative basis at German banks - the decline was
6.4 per cent.
Mr Wolfgang Strutz, the bank's senior partner, said profits on own account
trading had fallen by 89 per cent using the eight-twelfths comparison,
mainly as a result of write-downs in BHF's bond portfolio. Risk provisions
had risen by 5.7 per cent, with the bank exposed to both the Schneider
property and Procedo/Balsam factoring collapses.
Growth in partial operating profits, which exclude own account trading, was
17.7 per cent; the bank gave no total. Interest rate business produced
profits growth of 14 per cent, with commission income up by 2 per cent.
Elaborating on the new structure, to be put in place over the next year, Mr
Strutz said this should lead to 'a significant increase' in earnings per
share. But the investment in new systems and people would affect the 1995
result and probably that of 1996.
Compared with the 1993 return on capital of 13.4 per cent before tax, he
said the bank was aiming at 20 per cent. The aim was to earn returns similar
to those of other international banks.
BHF is refocusing its activities to become one of Europe's leading advisory
and trading banks in the next five years.
BHF, in which the Allianz insurance group and DG Bank own large minority
stakes, will concentrate on corporate banking, financial markets, and
private banking and asset management.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ciga reduces debt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group controlled by ITT of the US, has cut
its losses and reduced debt in the first half of 1993.
The consolidated net loss for the first six months of the year reached
L64bn, compared with L110bn in the equivalent period of 1993, thanks partly
to an improved performance from the core hotels division.
The group's share issue earlier this year has also allowed Ciga to reduce
its debts to L232bn at June 30, compared with L1,102bn six months earlier.
ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, has 35.25 per
cent of Ciga, and has launched a formal bid for a further 35.25 per cent,
which will close at the end of this week.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ferfin cuts debt by near 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Capital increases and asset sales enabled Ferruzzi Finanziaria, the
financial holding company of Italy's Montedison industrial group, to cut
debt in the first six months of this year by nearly 30 per cent to L15,768bn
(Dollars 10bn).
At end-1993, Ferfin's debt stood at L21,951bn, or 5.5 times net equity. The
debt-equity ratio had come down to 1.7 by June 30. Last year creditor banks
of Ferfin and Montedison agreed to convert some of their loans into equity
to rescue the group from near-collapse following years of alleged
mismanagement.
Ferfin also reported a return to pre-tax profit of L144bn in the first half,
compared with a loss of L840bn in the first six months of 1993.
The group said that it expected the second half to be even better than the
first, but warned that the net result of the group would still be negative.
In 1993, Ferfin reported a consolidated net loss of L2,419bn, and Montedison
a net loss of L1,611bn.
In the first half Ferfin's turnover rose to L11,431bn, against L11,489bn.

FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Air France reduces loss to
FFr2.61bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Air France, the French state-owned airline, reduced losses for the first
half of the year to FFr2.61bn (Dollars 495m) from FFr3.82bn in the same
period in 1993.
The French flag carrier, which is in the midst of a restructuring package
after several years of substantial losses, has said it hopes to limit losses
to about FFr3.7bn in the 15 months to the end of March 1995. In 1993, the
airline had a net deficit of FFr8.48bn.
In an attempt to return to profits, Mr Christian Blanc, chairman, has
implemented a restructuring package aimed at increasing productivity by 30
per cent by 1997. The plan is to be accompanied by a capital injection of
FFr20bn from the French state over the period.
Air France cited some signs of encouragement in the first six months. It
said that sales had stabilised after the sharp decline of 1993 and totalled
FFr27.5bn. The overall figure masked an increase in volume sales of about
10.6 per cent, which was offset by price reductions as the company sought to
win back passengers from rival airlines.
Operating profits rose from FFr657m to FFr1.61bn. According to Air France,
it was only from April that the underlying results started to benefit from
the restructuring and cost-cutting plans from April.
The company has been pursuing a series of asset sales to help reduce debts,
which amounted to about FFr40bn at the beginning of the year. Last month,
Air France announced the long-awaited decision to sell its controlling stake
in the Meridien hotels chain to Forte.
Expenditure on acquisitions totalled FFr4.94bn during the period. This
principally represented the purchase of aircraft, including three Airbus
A340s and two Boeing 767s.
The period since the end of June has brought a reorganisation of the group
structure. Air France has sold its holding in Air Inter, its domestic
subsidiary, to a new holding company which groups the two carriers'
interests.

FT  03 OCT 94 / UK Company News: KPMG expects record year for flotations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite record numbers of issues being pulled and a disturbing level of
profit warnings from recent candidates, 1994 is still set to break records
for flotations, according to KPMG Peat Marwick.
According to the latest statistics from the accountancy group, there were
182 flotations in the first nine months of the year, marginally higher than
the 180 issues launched in 1993.
So far this year, KPMG estimates that a total of Pounds 7.8bn has been
raised from new issues, and it expects that a pick-up in activity before the
November budget should put the final tally comfortably ahead of the 1986
record of Pounds 9bn.
This has happened in a year when offerings from Nottingham Group,
Aerostructures Hamble, McDonnell Douglas Information Systems, and United
Carriers have all followed upbeat share offers with profits warnings.
Mr Neil Austin, head of new issues at KPMG Corporate Finance, claims that
'those investors who have had their fingers burnt will be particularly wary
when looking at the new issues they are now being offered'.
'It is not difficult to see that some companies and their advisers will be
facing an uphill struggle to convince investors that they are of a suitable
size and quality to join the main stock market.'
Some issuers have already given up the fight. London Capital Holdings was
the first large issue to be pulled this year. It is not expected to recover
from the shock, with Citibank considered more likely to sell off the
properties.
The downturn in the stock market since late August has exacerbated concern
at the recent statements from Aerostructures Hamble and MDIS.
The combined effect has sparked the likely postponement of offers for carton
manufacturer Boxes, pizza chain Bright Reasons, and newsagents Martin
Retail. Mr Austin said there were some others that had also been added to
the danger list.
A higher number of companies have been forced to radically cut back their
target for capital raising. Pre-marketing exercises have been followed by
advisers radically scaling back price expectations in an attempt to relieve
the current institutional indigestion.
Games Workshop cut back its target capital raising from Pounds 20m to Pounds
12m when it announced its pricing last Friday, and others will follow.
As Mr Austin said: 'It is getting to the stage of the economic cycle where a
trade sale is becoming a meaningful alternative to flotation for people who
need an exit within the next six to nine months.'

Betacom, the consumer telecommunications company 66.17 per cent owned by
Amstrad, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 203,000 for the year to June 30.
The 61 per cent fall, from Pounds 516,000, came on the back of turnover
marginally ahead at Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 12.1m). Earnings per share were cut
to 0.3p (0.83p).
Operating profits for the period improved to Pounds 138,000, compared with
Pounds 57,000; however, this year's pre-tax figure included a Pounds 55,000
provision for loss on sale of fixed assets, while last year's included a
Pounds 213,000 profit on the sale of fixed asset investments.

FT  03 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Atlas jumps by 35% to Pounds 1.86m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Atlas Converting Equipment, the manufacturer of slitting and rewinding
machinery, improved pre-tax profits 35 per cent in the half year to June 30,
from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 1.86m, on turnover virtually unchanged at Pounds
19.3m.
Mr Christopher Rogers, chairman, said continuing difficult trading
conditions had again resulted in low margins, with 'no immediate prospect'
of improvement. However, improved results at General Vacuum helped offset
lower margins elsewhere. He added that the order book in all divisions led
the company to expect an increase in output and profits for the second half.
A 7p interim dividend is maintained on earnings per share of 11.86p
(10.01p).

<TEXT>
Saint-Louis, the French food and paper group, lifted first-half profits to
FFr401m (Dollars 76m), compared with FFr252m in the same period of 1993, on
a 2 per cent rise in turnover to FFr17.75bn.
The sharp profit increase was partly accounted for by restructuring costs in
early 1993 for the group's Euralim food subsidiary and its Arjo Wiggins
Appleton paper subsidiary that did not reoccur this year.
However, the profit contribution of the group's paper business rose to
FFr229m compared to FFr156m in the first half of last year.
In Europe, Arjo Wiggins Appleton significantly improved profitability which
in the US was maintained at a high level, the group said.

Banque Hervet, the French retail bank, recovered to return profits in the
first half of the year of FFr28m (Dollars 5.3m) compared with losses of
FFr361m in the previous corresponding term.
Hervet was scheduled last year to be sold by the government as part of its
privatisation programme, but the plan was shelved this spring pending a
recapitalisation.
The bank said the privatisation plans were still suspended, although a
recapitalisation agreed with shareholders was completed in June this year.
Hervet reported provisions down substantially and said all of its operations
has been profitable except Hervet Credit, specialising in property
financing. Its solvency ratio stood at 10.5 per cent, against a regulatory
minimum of 8 per cent.

FT  03 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hillsdown plans to redefine premium account
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hillsdown Holdings, the food manufacturing group, is to seek shareholders'
permission to redefine Pounds 420m of its share premium account as other
reserves.
The company said the move was a technical one which would enable it to use
the share premium account reserves to write off goodwill which had
previously arisen on acquisitions.
The write-offs had amounted to Pounds 562.5m over a number of years, and had
previously been set against the profit and loss reserves. The latter stood
at Pounds 22m at the 1993 year-end.
An emergency shareholders meeting has been set for October 28, and if
approved, the company must apply to the courts to approve the change in
definition.
Hillsdown stressed that the reserves would not be allowable initially as
redistributable reserves from which dividends are paid. However, they could
become allowable after any restrictions that the court might put on its
ruling are met.

FT  03 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Baris refinances and restates results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Baris Holdings, the USM-traded building services company, plans a
refinancing. The announcement accompanied restated results for its last
financial year to include a Pounds 1.68m writedown on the Little Britain
project in London.
This follows settlement of arbitration proceedings against Wimpey
Construction after the Baris results were originally announced in May and
increased the pre-tax loss to Pounds 3.12m for the year to February 28. This
compared with a reported Pounds 1.43m loss in May and a Pounds 351,000
deficit previously.
Baris plans to raise Pounds 1.72m net, by way of a placing and 9-for-8 open
offer of 7.99m new shares at 25p. In addition, the company is converting
Pounds 2m of bank debt by way of a subscription for 5m convertible
preference shares at 40p each, convertible into ordinary shares of 10p each
on a 1-for-1 basis.
The proposals are subject to shareholders' approval at an EGM, but Baris
warned that if they were not implemented 'the company may unable to continue
to trade'.
The company has requested that the Stock Exchange waive the USM requirement
and allow the placing and open offer to be made at a discount to the current
share price of greater than 10 per cent. On Friday the shares fell 6p to
33p.
Mr Arthur Morton, who is currently chairman of a number of quoted companies
including Vistec Group, the computer systems supplier, but who at present
does not own any shares in Baris, has undertaken to subscribe in full for
those shares not taken up. After this he will hold a minimum stake of 15.8
per cent and a maximum 36.4 per cent.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Dresdner and BNP strengthen ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dresdner Bank and Banque Nationale de Paris plan to strengthen their
partnership, established last year, by making joint acquisitions in European
countries.
The banks want to boost their position in markets where they are
under-represented.
Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chairman of Dresdner's managing board, said yesterday
that they also intended to merge their operations in Spain in the first
quarter of next year, the first such move they have made.
He told a press conference in Madrid during the IMF/World Bank annual
meetings that the banks planned to form a joint subsidiary in Spain and buy
out minority equity holders in BNP's operation. He said the banks, which
hold small stakes in each other, intended to make joint acquisitions in
addition to opening joint operations outside their home countries. There
were no acquisition targets, but in countries such as Italy where neither
has a strong presence, they might try to acquire an existing commercial or
investment banking operation.
The BNP/Dresdner co-operation deal has been investigated by the European
Commission on competition grounds, but no decision has been taken. The banks
want to raise their cross-share holdings to 10 per cent in the long term.
The most concrete move the two banks have undertaken has been to open joint
subsidiaries in eastern Europe, including Prague, St Petersburg, and
Budapest, but Spain would be the first operational merger.
Because BNP's operation in Spain is 23 per cent owned by minority
shareholders, the restructuring would have to be accompanied by a public
offering for their shares. The two banks have established a joint working
group to plan the future of the Spanish operation. It is expected to
concentrate on large and medium-sized companies, and on private banking for
rich individuals.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Concerns cloud healthy sector -
SHK Properties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sun Hung Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's leading property developers,
will post its final results on Friday, effectively winding up the colony's
reporting season.
SHK Properties boasts one of the biggest land banks in Hong Kong and the
market is looking for an annual increase in earnings of around 30 per cent
to HKDollars 8.7bn (Pounds 705m). Earnings per share are forecast to improve
23 per cent to HKDollars 3.88. This marks a deceleration on the past three
years, partially reflecting the mix of bank and government measures taken to
cool Hong Kong's overheating property market.
Results from the big property developers for last year range from a
virtually flat performance at Cheung Kong through to the 64 per cent surge
reported by Sino Land. Despite the stagnant performance, investors were
cheered by Cheung Kong's results which beat the expected 20 per cent
decline. But the developers go into their new financial year with a number
of concerns which could dent this year's healthy rises. Although the
government has called off - temporarily - its war on rocketing home prices,
bank mortgage limits remain in place while interest rates are rising.
Property prices have dropped around 10-15 per cent since April, just after
the government revealed its intention to act on rocketing home prices.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Company News (This Week): Policy of lending through
recession set to pay off - Bank of Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland, which reports its interim results on Wednesday, is
expected to show that its policy of lending through the recession is paying
off. Market forecasts of interim pre-tax profits range from Pounds 190m to
Pounds 202m, up from Pounds 117.6m at the halfway stage a year ago. Analysts
are waiting for earnings per share figures of 9.6p-10.4p, of which about
2.1p will go in dividend.
The figures are contingent, above all, on estimates of Bank of Scotland's
bad debt provision. If it falls at the rate of other UK banks, profits would
turn out at the higher end of the range. But Scotland, which never went into
recession as deeply as other parts of the UK, has commensurately less
potential to rebound.
Other banks have achieved profit growth as the UK economy comes out of
recession. But none have improved their results at the same time as
increasing lending and income at the pace of Bank of Scotland. One analyst
forecast 9 per cent growth in total income in the year to this first half.
The next fastest growing UK bank achieved total income growth of 7 per cent
and one's figures actually declined by 4 per cent.
Bank of Scotland has had room to expand in that its business a decade ago
was exclusively north of the border. Now more is in England and Wales than
in its home territory.
Analysts have periodically speculated on the logic of an approach to an
English building society. The bank's culture remains conservative, however.
In any case, few building societies have signalled their readiness to sell
out.
Costs, as well as income, are rising at a faster rate than the sector as a
whole. But Bank of Scotland responds with irritation to suggestions that it
should now curb its expenses. The lowest cost-income ratio of major UK banks
is proof of its efficiency, Bank of Scotland believes.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Woolworth chief out after rift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr William Lavin, the chief executive of Woolworth, has unexpectedly left
the US retailer less than five months after being stripped of the
chairmanship over the disclosure that the company had falsified financial
reports. Mr Lavin's departure, and the announcement that Woolworth is
starting a search for a new chief executive from outside, throws further
doubt on the future of the troubled group. Hit by growing losses, the
company was forced to cut its quarterly dividend from 29 cents to 15 cents
in July.
Woolworth said Mr Lavin's departure was due to differences with the board
over the future direction of the company. It refused to say what the
differences were, and Mr Lavin could not be contacted for comment. Mr Lavin
has resigned as chief executive, vice chairman and a director, 'effective
immediately', Woolworth said.
The disagreement over strategy throws into doubt the restructuring pursued
by Mr Lavin and raises the spectre of further asset sales. Mr Lavin has
slashed Woolworth's US general merchandise stores and sold its chain of
discount stores in Canada, while expanding in speciality retailing. But
continuing pressure on profit margins in the US and disappointing results in
Europe led to a jump in losses in the second quarter.
Mr Lavin had been reinstated as chief executive in May, after stepping aside
pending the outcome of an internal investigation into of accounting
policies. That review found quarterly financial reports in 1993 had been
deliberately misstated to allow it report profits rather than losses.

FT  03 OCT 94 / First Choice falls out with German bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Relations between the British travel group First Choice Holidays and
Germany's Westdeutsche Landesbank, which controls a 21 per cent stake in it,
have been soured by a succession of cancelled strategy meetings and the
failure of planned joint projects.
Lazard Brothers, First Choice's financial adviser, is believed to be
attempting to clarify the future of the relationship with Schroders, the
merchant bank which is acting for Thomas Cook, itself 90 per cent owned by
WestLB. Any attempt by the German bank to take control is likely to be
resisted fiercely by First Choice.
Thomas Cook's purchase of a 21 per cent stake helped First Choice - then
called Owners Abroad - to fight off a hostile takeover bid last year from
Airtours, a rival tour operator.
Owners Abroad's management said at the time that the relationship would
enable it to make substantial cost savings. These would be achieved through
co-operation between Owners Abroad and LTU, the German travel company, in
which WestLB had a 34 per cent stake.
Owners Abroad said co-operation with LTU would allow it to cut costs through
shared aircraft maintenance, fuel buying and spares purchasing. Owners
Abroad said the link would also give it greater buying power in booking
holiday accommodation.
Owners Abroad said the tie-up with Thomas Cook would enable it to increase
its sales through the latter's retail outlets.
After successfully repelling the Airtours bid, however, Mr Howard Klein,
Owners Abroad's chairman, and Mr Roger Allard, the managing director,
resigned after disclosing that full-year profits would be only half of
market expectations. The Takeover Panel later cleared them of misleading
shareholders.
Mr Michael Julien replaced Mr Klein as chairman last year. Mr Francis Baron
was appointed chief executive. In August, they announced that they were
changing the name of the group to First Choice.
Travel industry observers say the new leadership at First Choice has been
unable to establish a harmonious relationship with WestLB.
It is understood that scheduled quarterly strategy meetings between the two
sides have been cancelled by the Germans. Few of the planned benefits of the
link between First Choice and LTU have been realised.
Relations between First Choice and Thomas Cook have been warmer. Mr
Christopher Rodrigues, Thomas Cook's chief executive, sits on the First
Choice board.
Industry observers believe, however, that the tie with Thomas Cook has
hampered First Choice's efforts to sell holidays though other travel agents.
First Choice is believed to have spent months repairing relations with Lunn
Poly, Britain's largest travel retailer, after it expressed concern about
the Thomas Cook link.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Stock Exchange may alter rules on short selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Stock Exchange is proposing to amend its rules on the short selling of
securities in order to limit market manipulation. Short selling is the sale
of securities one does not already own. Short sellers usually hope to be
able to buy back more cheaply the shares they have just sold.
The exchange has been under pressure from the Securities and Investment
Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, to review rules on short
selling. The Treasury has expressed concern because it believes current
rules may have the effect of increasing the cost of raising capital and
damage London as a financial centre.
In a consultative document to be issued today, the exchange indicated it is
reluctant to make radical changes to current rules which allow unrestricted
short selling but only by market makers - firms which agree to buy and sell
large quantities of stocks in all market conditions.
'If regulation of short selling is indeed needed in the UK, then it should
be introduced with caution, it should focus specifically on the areas of
greatest concern and it should not impede the liquidity of the market,' the
consultative document said.
The exchange concluded that the potential for market manipulation through
short selling is greatest during an 'international book-building' by an
issuer whose shares are already traded.
The exchange noted that these book-building exercises, common in the US,
significantly cut the cost of raising capital. In a book-building, the
issuer announces the intention to sell shares at a future date and the
advisers in the meantime attempt to find buyers. Because the price is not
set until the day the new shares are sold, investors have an incentive to
use all available means, including short selling, to drive the price down.
The exchange cites complaints about five such exercises in recent years. The
most recent were rights issues for Eurotunnel and EuroDisney earlier this
year. The UK government's sale of the second and third tranches of its
holdings in British Telecommunications were also cited.
The exchange said it had no conclusive evidence that short selling was to
blame for the sharp drop in prices in these cases. It is proposing a new
rule requiring firms to distinguish between short sales and outright sales
when reporting their own and their clients' business to it.
The exchange is also seeking comments on four possible approaches to
restrict the manipulative effect of short selling:
require, as in the US, public disclosure of the market's aggregate short
interest position;
ban the covering of a short position with shares bought in a secondary
offering;
give issuers greater control over who is allowed to buy shares in a
secondary offering, possibly requiring buyers to promise not to sell any of
their existing holdings until the book-building is complete; or
allow those offering the shares to insist they be dealt for cash or
purchases settled more quickly.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Sonar find heightens theory on Estonia's bow doors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Finnish investigators said last night they had detected a large object lying
close to the sunken Baltic ferry Estonia, heightening speculation that the
vessel capsized because of the loss of an outer bow door.
Mr Jouko Nourteva, a Finnish marine geologist, said the object was lying 10
to 20 metres from the bow, but it was not clear whether it was part of the
roll-on roll-off ship.
Swedish officials have said the Estonia's outer bow door may have been
ripped off in heavy seas last Wednesday, causing water to surge into the car
deck and capsize the ferry within minutes. At least 139 of the vessel's
1,050 passengers survived the catastrophe.
The Estonia, operated by the Swedish-Estonian company Estline, was sailing
from the Estonian capital, Tallinn, to Stockholm when she sank in stormy
seas. Mr Nourteva, who located the wreck on Friday using sophisticated sonar
equipment, said: 'The observation of a large object is certain because it
was seen on all four sonar pictures that were taken.'
As memorial services were held at churches throughout Sweden, Finland and
Estonia yesterday, a Finnish search vessel carrying robot-mounted cameras
filmed the Estonia wreck to try to assess why the vessel sank, and the
difficulty of recovering the 800 bodies believed to be inside.
Investigators said the pictures from the search vessel were of 'very good
quality'. But they apparantly did not pinpoint the large object detected by
the sonar survey. The ferry is lying in about 80m of water, 40km from the
Finnish island of Uto.
Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway have all ordered urgent safety checks on
roll-on roll-off ferries sailing in their waters amid reports of
difficulties with the bow doors of other ships.
Sweden's Stena Line, the world's leading ferry operator, has withdrawn one
of its Irish Sea ferries from service because of difficulties with the
bow-door locking mechanism. It said one of the locking pins of the
14-year-old Stena Felicity had sheared off, although there had been no water
penetration.
The fault was discovered last month when the port side outer door was found
to be jammed shut. A Stena spokesman said the problem was caused by a failed
electrical relay. This was corrected, but upon closer inspection a locking
pin was found to have sheared off, requiring dry-dock repairs, he said.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Blair's 'crusade for change' undermined by tension over tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BLACKPOOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Tension over Labour's tax plans for the middle classes yesterday undermined
Mr Tony Blair's efforts to secure a trouble-free conference debut as party
leader.
As party officials cleared the way for compromises on minimum wages, women's
rights and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair sought to set the tone for the
conference in a statement promising a 'crusade for change'.
His comments came as Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, outlined a
comprehensive series of measures being considered as part of Labour's
industrial regeneration plan.
He emphasised in an interview with the Financial Times that a Labour
government would seek a partnership with business rather than seek to direct
it and said the priority was to tackle short-termism and to promote greater
investment in training.
Mr Brown will also use the opening of today's debate on the economy to
underline the party leadership's commitment to modernising the welfare
state.
He will signal Labour's plans to integrate the tax and benefit system for
pensioners and to use the benefit system to remove work disincentives for
the unemployed.
Mr Brown played down remarks by Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, which
appeared to signal support for higher taxes for the better off.
He said Mr Prescott's view was in line with Mr Blair, who pledged in his
statement that 'people who generate ideas, jobs and wealth have nothing to
fear from a Labour government'. However, Mr Prescott said on independent
television's Walden programme that Labour had given no promises to any
groups of voters on taxation.
Mr Blair's efforts to modernise the party were repeatedly attacked at
pre-conference fringe meetings by leftwing activists accusing him of seeking
to compete with the Conservatives in running a market economy.
The leadership was more embarrassed by disclosures that delegates from many
big unions will be told how to vote by union leaders, undermining the
abolition of the union block vote at last year's conference.
Mr Blair insisted that last year's conference decision to scrap block voting
stood. He told Sky News: 'Last October, the block vote was finished, it
died. People are entitled to vote at the conference as individual members,
as individual delegates.'
Senior party officials were confident that a threatened row over the party's
commitment to a minimum wage had been averted by a compromise resolution
referring the issue to a commission due to report next year.
The resolution confirms Labour's commitment to a legally enforceable
national minimum wage pegged to half the level of male median earnings, but
meets Mr Blair's concern that the party should avoid specifying a figure.
The ruling national executive committee announced a shift of emphasis on
Northern Ireland towards neutrality between the nationalist and unionist
traditions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Italian government has been so preoccupied with agreeing a budget that
it has allowed its privatisation programme to flag. The coalition partners
have squabbled over how and, indeed, whether groups such as Stet (telecoms),
Enel (electricity) and Eni (oil and chemicals) should be sold off. The
companies have jockeyed for position over which should go first. Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the prime minister, last week tried to inject some momentum into
the process by announcing a new timetable: Stet and Enel would be sold by
June 1995. He made no mention of Eni, though the government later said it
had not been forgotten.
Italy clearly needs to get a move on. Not only do the overall budget
projections depend on privatisation proceeds of L10,000bn in each of the
next three years; IRI, the debt-laden state holding company which owns Stet,
badly needs cash. But setting a timetable on its own is not enough. Previous
deadlines have slipped.
Before Stet and Enel can be sold, the coalition needs to agree on the
companies' structures. In Stet's case, the central question is whether it
should merge with its main subsidiary Telecom Italia. In Enel's case, the
questions are whether competitors should be allowed into electricity
generation and whether the distribution network should be split on regional
lines. The new timetable provides a short breathing space in which such
issues can be resolved. But it could too easily be wasted unless Mr
Berlusconi moves smartly to knock heads together.

The UK water sector currently yields an average 5.8 per cent, a full 1.6
percentage points above the electricity sector. That is because electricity
stocks have had such a good run in recent months, outperforming the market
by nearly 25 per cent since May. Some investment houses have used the
difference in yield to justify recommending their investors to switch from
electricity to water. Some shareholders even seem to have heeded their
brokers' advice. At the end of last week, the water sector was up 1.7 per
cent on the previous Friday's close. The electricity sector was down 3.4 per
cent.
Such arguments only take into account present yields, not future growth. On
that basis, the outlook for the regional electricity companies is better
than that for their water counterparts. With ungeared balance sheets, the
Recs are looking for ways to hand back their excess cash. There could be
further share buy-back schemes or even one-off bumper dividends. The
proceeds from next year's National Grid sale could also be redistributed to
shareholders. Shares could be marked up in preparation for the end, early
next year, of the moratorium on mergers and acquisitions in the sector.
In the short term, as the Recs move into the closed period during which they
cannot announce share buy-back schemes, their shares look set to
underperform. In the long-term, the electricity groups look live-wires, the
water stocks stagnant by comparison.

At one level, Mr Martin Ebner, the maverick investor whose fund has built up
a 19 per cent stake in UBS's registered capital, has certainly done the bank
a favour. Many large Swiss companies have rightly unwound discriminatory
shareholding structures in recent years on the grounds that they are
inappropriate in a modern world of global investment flows. Banks thought
this presented special legal difficulties, connected partly with
restrictions on foreign ownership of property. Mr Ebner naturally has an
interest in preserving the status quo but his attack has at least forced UBS
to look again and discover that no such problems stand in the way of a
modern capital structure.
That said, it will require extraordinary unselfishness on the part of
registered shareholders to vote away their privileges. The registered share
price would inevitably fall steeply. By siding with Mr Ebner, shareholders
might also increase the chances of him forcing management to pay closer
attention to increasing return on shareholders' funds.
Yet although increased shareholder activism is welcome in the Swiss market,
Mr Ebner is still taking things a little far. UK institutions rarely
intervene directly and publicly with management unless things have gone
manifestly wrong. Mr Ebner is behaving less like a concerned institution and
more like a buccaneering conglomerateur who wants to seize control on the
basis of minority stake. Retail investors in his fund will not thank him if,
having used their money to buy expensively into UBS, he fails and has to
sell out at a loss.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Publication of the OFT-sponsored report by Mr Paul Marsh, of the London
Business School, on underwriting commissions will set the cat among the City
pigeons. The report concludes that the fixed 2 per cent commission paid to
underwriters is unjustified. Certain institutions have been anxious to see
the document suppressed, a sure indication that it should be published as
soon as possible, together with the responses of merchant banks and other
interested parties.
The mechanics of raising equity in the UK look inflexible when compared with
practice in the US. There, corporations are not obliged to offer new shares
to existing shareholders and can therefore gauge the level of potential
demand before setting the price of new shares. Large amounts of cash can be
raised by such book-building exercises in days, rather than the three weeks
required for a UK issue. Fees in the US are higher than in the UK, but the
new shares can be issued at negligible discounts to existing share prices.
That compares with a 15 to 20 per cent discount in the UK, which reflects
the inherent market risks. Arguably the cost of capital is higher as a
result.
A change to the existing UK system would be difficult in the light of
pre-emption rights. But these need not be sacrosanct, nor indeed should they
be an issue if the shares can be offered at, or close to, the market price.
Merchant banks should become more imaginative in finding ways of
circumventing the discount, rather than seeking to smother the Marsh report.
But traditional merchant banks, without the capital base or the distribution
capacity of large integrated houses, have a great deal to lose if the
existing system is changed.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Chrysler plans to reduce number of parts suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, the US carmaker, is planning a radical reduction in the number of
its first-tier components suppliers to about 150 from 1,200 at present.
It is also expected in December to approve an increase in its expenditure
programme to about Dollars 22.5bn (Pounds 14.2bn) for the five years from
1995 to 1999. That compares with Dollars 20bn planned for the period
1994-98.
After coming close to financial collapse at the beginning of the 1990s,
Chrysler, the smallest of the big three US carmakers, has emerged as the
most profitable of them, with record profits of Dollars 1.89bn, in the first
six months of this year.
It has become one of the world's lowest-cost carmakers, partly as the result
of reforms to the structure of its supply base. Most of the world's leading
carmakers are sharply reducing the number of their suppliers in order to
simplify and streamline their operations, but Chrysler has taken one of the
most radical approaches.
First-tier suppliers are being asked to shoulder much more of the research
and development burden for new products, and in return are being rewarded
with much longer-term contracts and, increasingly, single-source contracts.
Mr Tom Stallkamp, Chrysler vice-president for purchasing, said the company
had already reduced the number of its first-tier suppliers from 3,000 five
years ago.
Chrysler's top 150 suppliers account for 90 per cent of its Dollars 27bn
total purchasing of parts, goods, services and equipment.
It has cut the number of its tyre suppliers from seven to two, its paint
suppliers from five to two and the number of its wiring suppliers from 14 to
two.
Mr Robert Eaton, Chrysler chairman and chief executive, said the company
intended to concentrate on the core activities of overall vehicle design and
development, sheet metal stamping and car assembly, and developing engines
and transmissions and electronics.
It had one of the lowest levels of 'vertical integration' among western
carmakers, buying in almost 70 per cent of the cost of a vehicle from
outside suppliers.
Mr Stallkamp said greater integration of leading outside suppliers into its
operations since 1990-91 had led to suppliers' putting forward proposals for
cost savings totalling Dollars 921m.
Savings totalling Dollars 504m had been approved this year and the company
was targeting savings of Dollars 750m in 1995.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Personal View: Challenge of change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
When the Bretton Woods institutions were organised 50 years ago, their task
of helping rebuild a ravaged Europe and bringing order to the global
economic system was clear. Though probably the tallest order of its kind in
modern times, they did the job and did it well.
Today, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund face different
challenges. Fifty years ago we were dealing with less than a quarter of the
world's economy. Today, the developing world and transition economies
account for nearly half of global output.
Today the challenge is development and transition, to spread prosperity. The
price of failure is just as high, perhaps higher. But the benefits of
success have never been greater.
Both the IMF and World Bank need to look anew at how they can contribute.
For the IMF, it is a matter of maximising the economic reform it can
support. The Bank must focus on bringing more people into the development
process - as participants in planning and as beneficiaries of progress.
The IMF is achieving real results in helping Russia and the other transition
economies reform and rebuild. The carrot of financial support has a
tremendous impact. But there is still much to be achieved.
We have asked the IMF to go one step further to support the kind of
comprehensive reforms needed for full transition. Increasing access to IMF
resources for countries committed to strong reform measures - in eastern
Europe, the former Soviet Union and around the developing world  - can
increase the incentive to take the difficult steps toward productive
market-based economies. Extending the Structural Transformation Facility is
also critical to reinforcing this process.
To make their participation in the world economy and monetary system
complete, all member countries should have the rights and benefits of
membership of the IMF. The US has proposed bringing equity to the allocation
of Special Drawing Rights. Completing this issue, along with enhancement of
support for reform, will be central both to our meetings in Madrid and to
the future of the IMF.
Stability in the world economy is important to the prospects for the
developing, transition, and industrialised economies. The Group of Seven
finance ministers are committed to strengthening their policy co-ordination
efforts. There is a crucial role for the IMF in this process. Nevertheless
it is our view that a flexible process of co-operation, not fixed exchange
rates or target zones, is the best way forward.
Just as we have learned that austerity is no substitute for careful
adjustment, we also know that broad policy changes are not enough for
sustained and sustainable development and growth. At the heart of economic
activity and productivity are more basic questions. Are workers educated?
Are they healthy? Is the population growing too fast for the economy to ever
catch up?
There are no easy answers. But with 1bn people in the world existing on less
than a dollar a day, we must start somewhere. This is the World Bank's
challenge.
The Bank should start by putting people first, with more attention to
health, population control and education, particularly for women. It must
begin to utilise the private sector better, supporting and not supplanting
the strongest available force for development. And it must support bottom-up
development. Micro-enterprises, for instance, can be a remarkable tool for
driving development.
The Bank is turning in this direction. More information about Bank loans and
operations is available to the public. More concern has been focused on the
resettlement implications of large projects. Loan quality is being addressed
by strengthening oversight and concentrating on coherent approaches to
development in each country. These changes must be deepened and become part
of the Bank culture.
In addition, the changes being implemented at the Bank must be adopted by
the regional development banks.
The upcoming 11th replenishment of the International Development Association
offers the opportunity to strengthen the development impact of the new
direction in Bank practices.
Our national security institutions are changing to face the new challenges.
But our economic institutions are only just beginning and must now commit
themselves to making these new approaches a way of life.

Welcome signs of movement at The Body Shop. Texan Gwen Gober, who
professionalised Kingfisher's public relations, has been recruited to help
the embattled cosmetics group rebuild its environmentally-friendly public
image. She is being brought in to help ease the strain on Gavin Grant, the
former architect of the RSPCA's controversial dead dogs and ponies
advertising campaign, who has not had much luck persuading Anita and Gordon
Roddick to love journalists.
For starters, Gober must try to prevent the Roddicks from continually
referring to City financiers as 'pin-striped dinosaurs'. Such descriptions
may be well deserved, but as Gerald Ratner can testify some home truths are
best left unsaid. Body Shop need not go the same way as Ratners.

<TEXT>
What is upper-most in the minds of the captains of industry who have made
the long trip north to Labour's Blackpool conference?
National Power gave the game away when it invited one of shadow chancellor
Gordon Brown's staff to its conference party. In a corner of the card
offering drinks and light refreshments at The Imperial, a National Power
employee had noted the reason for the invitation. Scrawled in pencil was the
phrase 'executive share options'.
Meanwhile, Labour's success in sucking more money out of the corporate
sector has not pleased all the comrades. Dennis Skinner, the leftwing 'beast
of Bolsover' was incensed by the discovery that Marconi is sponsoring a
reception for the party's national executive committee tonight. He has made
it quite clear that he and Tony Benn, the other pillar of the left wing, are
not going to be on parade at any booze-up sponsored by a company in the
armaments business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One unfortunate casualty of the ongoing debate about the quota of women MPs
in the Labour party was yesterday's traditional pre-conference football
match between the Labour party and Fleet Street. The match degenerated into
a farce because Labour insisted on fielding three female MPs led by Kate
Hoey, a former PE teacher.
The only time Labour looked like scoring was when Hoey was awarded a rather
dubious penalty. Her first attempt went over the bar and she was given a
second go because the goalkeeper - the FT's David Goodhart who boasts a
clean sheet for the Hampstead Heathens this season - had moved off the line.
Her second effort dribbled in and Goodhart was given a special award for
football chivalry. . . .

If alarm bells are not ringing in Britain's diplomatic service then they

South Africa's President Mandela?
Mandela is on his first state visit to the US and is busy shaking hands with
all sorts of business folk. What better way for Adams to project his public
image as Ireland's answer to Nelson Mandela than to arrange a meeting with
the great man himself. Much better than trying to get President Bill Clinton

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in
Madrid are attracting a less courtly breed of demonstrator than past annual
beanos.
Lewis Preston, the World Bank President, narrowly missed having a custard
pie - cunningly disguised as a birthday cake to mark the Bank's 50th
anniversary - pushed in his face at a weekend press conference. Security
staff intercepted the missile and quickly bundled out the party poopers
chanting '50 years is too much'.
Perhaps this near miss encouraged Preston to take a swipe at one of his old
banking pals, Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve board chairman. Maybe
it has something to do with his great height, but Volcker has always
appeared above criticism in the arcane world of international monetary
affairs. However, Preston couldn't resist a dig when asked to comment on
some of Volcker's past proposals for reorganising the World bank. 'Volcker
is an old friend and like everybody else he gets stuck in time,' said the
World Bank's 68-year-old president.
Britain's chancellor Kenneth Clarke was not much kinder. After hearing
Volcker express a clear preference for greater order in world foreign
exchange markets, Clarke concluded that he 'was struck how much times had
moved on'. Sic transit gloria.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Leading Article: A private nuclear future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The review of the nuclear power industry which the UK government has been
conducting over the past four months has thrown up many complex and
emotional issues. But they can all be boiled down to two basic questions.
Does the UK need to build any more nuclear power stations? Should the
nuclear power generation industry be privatised? Of these, the second is
much the more important.
From the nuclear industry's point of view, this is a good moment to address
both questions. The two state-owned companies, Nuclear Electric and Scottish
Nuclear have made impressive progress towards overcoming the profligacy and
misjudgments of the past. They now account for a quarter of the electricity
consumed in Britain, and they can produce it at a price which is beginning
to approach open market levels. The near-completion of Sizewell B also
suggests that the industry's technical abilities are alive and well.
At a time when the government is committed to reducing atmospheric
pollution, nuclear can also put up a legitimate environmental case that it
is 'cleaner' than fossil fuel plants.
On the other hand, Britain has a growing surplus of power generation
capacity, and though the nuclear component of that will shrink as first
generation Magnox reactors are phased out, there should be no automatic
presumption that they will be replaced with further nuclear plant.
Decommissioning cost
Another complication is the radioactive waste from nuclear power stations,
and the cost of decommissioning them when they reach the end of their lives.
Neither of the two state-owned companies is fully provisioned for these
costs: their liabilities are being covered partly by subsidies from the
electricity market, partly by the taxpayer. Although there is a prospect
that the newer power stations will be able to provision themselves, this may
never be the case with the old Magnox stations whose economics are so
doubtful that they will have to remain in government hands whatever happens
to the rest of the business.
On the face of it, the case for privatisation is thus not strong. In its
present shape, the industry is not capable of operating commercially because
of its huge inherited liabilities and operating costs. The financial markets
remain deeply sceptical about the risks of nuclear power.
But all this should not deter the government from exploring ways of
reshaping the industry into a form that could become fully commercial. The
managements of both state-owned companies are keen to be privatised, and
have put forward detailed cases in support of their ambitions.
Investor credibility
The main aim of the review should be to identify those parts of the
generation companies which are capable of standing on their own feet and
creating out of them businesses that would have credibility with investors.
This would include the more efficient AGR stations and Sizewell B. And it is
through the privatisation of the business rather than by government diktat
that the future of nuclear power must be decided.
Making privatisation work will depend on resolving two problems that affect
the commercial viability of nuclear power. First, failure to align prices
with wider social costs and benefits can lead to distorted outcomes. Thus if
nuclear plant is required to bear the full environmental costs including
those of decommissioning and spent fuel storage, the same must apply to
other forms of electricity generation. Otherwise competition would not be
equal.
Second, nuclear power faces unique political risks against which no private
operator could hope to insure itself. This problem needs to be addressed by
government if a privatised industry is to invest in efficient new generating
capacity. Provided these problems are solved, privatisation would be
appropriate and should be workable. The management of these companies would
be best placed to decide whether further development of nuclear power was
viable.
The truth is that there is no special case for nuclear power, any more than
there was for coal. But if the managers of the industry want to go private,
and investors are prepared to back them, they should be given the chance.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Trouble down on the farm: As the EU expands eastwards,
Alison Maitland and Deborah Hargreaves examine the need to reform the CAP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has moved beef and grain mountains, but further
reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is an altogether more painful
prospect.
This did not stop the Commission last week publishing a report by an
independent panel of experts calling for such reforms. The Commission
distanced itself, officially, from the report's conclusions - produced by
experts from Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Sweden and the UK -
and watched as a wave of protests by farmers confirmed their resistance to
further CAP reform.
But it is clear that the report will be used by factions within the
Commission to stimulate debate on an overhaul.
The farming industry is still trying to absorb the shock of sweeping reforms
brokered by Mr Ray MacSharry, former agriculture commissioner, two years
ago. But many farmers privately acknowledge that further reforms are
inevitable if the European Union is to meet its commitments under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its ambitions to enlarge
eastwards.
The enormous burden of the CAP on the European consumer and taxpayer is also
a powerful argument for reform. According to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, the CAP cost each person in the EU Dollars 385
last year. This cost represents an average subsidy of Dollars 15,400 for
each full-time agricultural worker, or Dollars 980 per hectare of farmland.
The extent of these subsidies has become transparent as part of the
MacSharry reforms under which farmers are paid direct compensation for the
price cuts and the idle land they have to endure. There is nothing unusual
about this scale of support. Indeed, with the exception of New Zealand and
Australia, all OECD countries subsidise their agriculture heavily.
But world farming markets are about to change, with the scheduled entry into
force of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement early next year. Many farm
experts, including the UK's National Farmers' Union, are unconvinced by the
Commission's assurances that the 1992 reforms will be enough to meet the
required cut in the volume of subsidised EU exports under the Gatt deal.
Indeed, debate over the future of the CAP was sparked in the UK six months
ago by an NFU study presenting members with stark choices over the future of
farm policy.
The sceptics argue that reductions in price support - together with
'set-aside', under which 15 per cent of arable land is taken out of
cultivation - will be insufficient to offset annual increases in output of
cereals per hectare. They expect beef production, too, to exceed the Gatt
limits for subsidised exports by the end of the decade. Such constraints,
the NFU argues, will present farmers with a tough choice before 2000: either
production controls will have to be strengthened, or price support through
intervention, the cardinal component of the CAP, will have to be abandoned.
But the freeing of trade, which will expose EU farmers to greater
competition, is not the only threat to the cosy world of the CAP. While
Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden's accession to the EU next year should
be broadly neutral financially, the eventual absorption of prospective
members from central and east Europe poses an enormous challenge. Eventually
their farming industries could be fiercely competitive, but they are
currently in severe decline because of the loss of traditional markets in
the former Soviet Union and the collapse of state distribution systems.
The EU is committed to bringing these nations into the fold. In Germany, the
most fervent advocate of enlargement to the east, there is growing political
recognition that this expansion would involve a re-examination of the CAP.
Agriculture officials in Brussels are drawing up plans this autumn to help
get east Europe's farm sector back onto its feet. They have a tough task,
given the conflict between the EU's desire to prevent political unrest in
the east and its concern to protect its own farmers.
Yet extending the CAP to east Europe would be beyond the resources of the
EU. An overstretched CAP budget was one of the driving forces behind the
MacSharry reforms. It could re-emerge as a pressure point in its own right,
long before the accession of the first central European countries.
Commission officials say inflationary pressures are building up which could
break the spending ceiling next year. This could bring renewed calls for a
renationalisation of the farm budget as suggested in last week's CAP report.
But such pressure will be resisted by many governments and farm groups.
Tied into the budget debate are growing public demands in northern Europe
for farming to be kinder to the environment, such as using fewer chemical
inputs. Environmental measures were built into the 1992 reforms for the
first time. But this has only encouraged lobbyists to push for all payments
to farmers to be tied to their adopting 'green' practices.
Together these forces add up to a compelling case for overhauling the CAP.
Yet among the Commission's agriculture officials there is a striking public
reticence to debate the issue. Mr Rene' Steichen, the outgoing agriculture
commissioner who has presided over implementation of the MacSharry reforms,
says it would be wrong to create fresh uncertainty in the farming community
when the reforms are working so well. He cites falling production - this
year's EU harvest is forecast at 160m tonnes compared with 185m tonnes in
1991 - and drops of 52 per cent and 77 per cent repectively in the grain and
beef mountains over the past year.
Mr Steichen would like to see cuts in the high level of compensation paid to
the best-off farmers for setting land aside. This compensation level was
conceded by the Commission in 1992 only under pressure from the farm
lobbies. He is also working on changes to sectors left untouched in 1992,
such as wine. But provided these reforms prove effective, he says, 'I don't
think there's a need to change the CAP.'
Mr Steichen's view is not shared by all of his Commission colleagues as last
week's CAP report shows. The report was ordered by officials in the
Commission's economics and financial affairs directorate as a way of
encouraging discussion on CAP reform.
However, many EU members are also hesitant about broaching farm reform. Any
suggestion that the 1992 reforms might be insufficient to meet the Gatt
commitments could risk a trade dispute with the US in the run-up to
ratification of the Uruguay Round accords.
Moreover, agreement to the agricultural part of the Gatt deal was wrung from
France in exchange for a commitment by the Commission not to increase the
level of set-aside without full compensation. The French say the exclusion
of small EU farmers from set-aside has left their big grain producers
bearing 40 per cent of the total burden of set-aside.
The lack of political will for further reform may also be linked partly to
the forthcoming elections in Germany and France.
Given these conflicts, it will be difficult to make even mild changes to the
CAP, such as deeper cuts in support prices, without extra compensation for
farmers that would overstretch the budget.
Tacitly, the need for a new approach to the CAP in the light of the east
Europe issue is acknowledged at the Commission. The issue is likely to be
back on the agenda in 1996 when the enlargement debate will be more
pressing. But ideas for far-reaching reform, such as paying farmers a
one-off lump sum in exchange for abolishing all support, appear to be out of
line with Brussels' thinking.
UK officials, serving a government that says it would ultimately like the
37-year-old CAP abolished, argue that the policy's staying power cannot be
underestimated. 'It has never collapsed under the weight of its
contradictions,' said one.
Indeed, the MacSharry reforms have arguably given it a longer lease of life
by making it easier to adjust price support, set-aside levels and
compensation while leaving the system's foundations intact. Mr MacSharry is
convinced the CAP will still be in place in 2010. 'I see a fine-tuning but
no revolutionary change,' he said. 'There's no doubt that while there will
be a European Union there will be a CAP.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Back from the brink
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judged by what might have happened, this weekend's US-Japanese trade
agreement marks a victory for common sense. The two sides have averted the
immediate danger of a trade war which would have seriously damaged the
global economy and sent shock-waves through financial markets. They have
also refrained from resorting explicitly to managed trade, which would
oblige Japan's government to deliver a fixed share of its national market to
US exporters, at the expense of other trading partners. Instead, there is at
least a possibility that the agreement may pave the way for beneficial
Japanese liberalisation on a multilateral basis.
However, the deal marks a truce, not an armistice, in the hostilities which
have embittered US-Japanese relations and bedevilled the world trade system
for almost a decade. The risk of a renewed flare-up remains, most obviously
over cars and car parts, where no agreement has been reached. Here, the US
continues to brandish the threat of eventual trade sanctions, albeit in the
form of its Section 301 legislation, rather than of the more draconian Super
301 mechanism. Much more remains to be done by the US and Japan if a durable
return to stability in the world trade system is to be assured.
The most encouraging augury - and the breakthrough which unlocked agreement
at the weekend - is the US decision to abandon its insistence on quantified
measures of foreign penetration of Japanese markets. Tokyo had rejected
these demands from the outset, on the grounds that they amounted to
numerical import targets. Though Washington denied this, it failed to dispel
suspicions that it was seeking to coerce the Japanese government into
cartelising its market for the benefit of US exporters.
Competitive access
Instead, the negotiators have agreed on a combination of actions by Tokyo to
enhance competitive access by increasing market transparency and relaxing
regulatory restrictions, notably in telecommunications, medical equipment
and insurance. The agreement also envisages that the benefits of such
liberalisation should be available to all foreign competitors, not just US
producers.
As well as honouring its commitment to greater openness, Tokyo needs firmly
to entrench the principle of multilateralism. Failure to do so would invite
accusations of favouritism from other trading powers - notably the EU - and
pressures to reach bilateral deals with them which would fragment the global
trade system. The most effective solution is for Japan to table this
weekend's concessions in the Gatt. Japan should also demand that the US seek
to resolve any future bilateral trade differences through negotiation in the
World Trade Organisation - or, if necessary, through the strengthened
dispute settlement procedures planned for the body.
Uruguay ratification
The priority for the US should be to facilitate that course by swiftly
ratifying the Uruguay Round world trade agreement. The deal with Japan
should help that process in two ways. First, it removes a distraction which
has absorbed far too much of the Clinton administration's political energy;
second, to the extent that it redeems the administration's reputation for
inept and irresolute handling of international economic policy, it should
strengthen its hand in dealing with an increasingly recalcitrant Congress.
Nonetheless, the hurdles to ratification remain daunting. Even if the
administration can overcome the recent delaying tactics of Senator Ernest
Hollings, the chairman of the Senate commerce committee, Congress seems
unlikely to vote on the Uruguay Round until after the November elections.
There is a risk that virulent partisanship could then induce many
Republicans to vote against the round simply to frustrate the
administration's agenda.
President Bill Clinton has compounded his difficulties by not selling the
round aggressively enough to Congress and the American people. He needs to
build swiftly on this weekend's agreement by spelling out clearly what is at
stake. No US congressman should be left in doubt about the size of the gains
which the Uruguay accord offers the US economy - or of the costs if it were
allowed to fail.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Salzburg sound of economic music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I recently arrived in Salzburg for a symposium on European
unemployment, I had a shock as I crossed the bridge into the city. For the
fortress seemed to have gone psychedelic in a variety of brilliant colours.
There was the old grey, an area repainted in brilliant white, which was
supposedly the original colour, and an intermediate area covered by
builders' green netting.
Yet this variety of colour in some ways symbolised our work. For thanks to
the initiative of Professor Herbert Giersch of Kiel, a founding member of
the German Council of Economic Advisers, 10 economists from a wide range of
the political spectrum managed to agree on a common manifesto. They included
Richard Cooper, a former Carter appointee, Patrick Minford, who was close to
Margaret Thatcher, and Wolfgang Rieke, recently of the Bundesbank.
The Salzburg manifesto pinpointed three 'proximate roots of high
unemployment': pay and associated labour costs which price workers out of
jobs; intermittent periods of low demand growth; and capacity shortages
which emerge in many countries in the recovery phases while unemployment is
still high.
Unlike some market economists, the Salzburg authors admitted that forces
such as globalisation and technical change had an adverse effect on
unskilled workers, which showed itself in unemployment in Europe but in low
pay in the US. Nevertheless we rejected any kind of protection to keep out
imports from poorer countries, and wanted to tackle the problem of low pay
by persuading other citizens to 'use the tax and transfer system to top up
low incomes by direct payments'.
These principles are the key. For the practical application must vary from
country to country and would require many pages of institutional detail. To
the extent that unemployment is a structural problem, it cannot be tackled
by a single brushstroke measure such as leaving or joining an exchange rate
arrangement.
In the end we agreed on nine points:
There has to be an appropriate macro-economic background. 'Inflationary
dashes for growth should be strictly avoided. But once inflation is at low
levels, monetary authorities have as much responsibility for avoiding
nominal demand deficiency as inflationary excess.' There was a specific
recommendation that 'the European Monetary Institute should monitor the
development of nominal gross domestic product at an EU level'.
Labour markets have to respond more quickly to market changes. I cannot
claim that we solved the problem of why pay and associated costs are so
often above market levels. But the manifesto urged that settlements reached
by collective bargaining should not rise in real terms in the years to come
so that productivity growth could be translated into an expansion of
employment. 'Equal pay for equal work' stands in the way of full employment.
This was not an anti-feminist rearguard action, but a reference to the need
to take on new workers at less than existing pay rates, to try to combine
pricing into jobs with the realities of insider power of those already at
work.
The market incomes of unskilled workers in the west are likely to move
nearer to those in developing countries. But there would be levelling up as
well as down. Moreover as real income in advanced countries would benefit
from the extra trade, there would be a surplus to channel towards those most
hard hit by economic change.
There is a need to invest in human capital to reduce present disparities in
earning power. The Salzburg writers gave the theme a new twist by rejecting
'credentialism' - that is multiplying the paper qualifications - and urging
credit vouchers for trainees.
Physical investment is needed too - but not generalised fiscal subsidies,
which too often encouraged capital-intensive projects. The best contribution
governments could make was to reduce their own structural budget deficits.
In a carefully negotiated aside we noticed 'that a Japanese current account
surplus - provided it is not achieved at the expense of a depressed economy
 -is a contribution to world savings'. This was not a digression but
recognised the inter-relationship of world capital markets and world real
interest rates.
Top-up payments for low-income households are preferable to other devices
such as minimum wage legislation or high benefits. But to carry the more
hardline German participants we had to underline in several different ways
that these top-up payments would be subject to means tests.
There should be no link between the dole and previous earnings if the
benefit is financed from taxation. There is a risk that the social chapter
of the Maastricht treaty will limit employment 'and should be watched
carefully'. Agreeing this point was some achievement among 10 signatories,
only two of whom were British and half of whom were based in Germany.
Many heartaches could be saved if a German government had the courage to
take the same attitude in European political discussions.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Capital gains proposal would
encourage retention of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr H M F SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Confederation of British Industry's proposal for the coming Budget
that long-term shareholdings should be free of capital gains tax is welcome
('CBI calls for Pounds 1bn support in Budget', September 28). One effect
would be to encourage senior executives who receive shares through executive
options or other incentives to hold on to them.
The CBI, in its May 1994 paper on long-term remuneration for senior
executives, wishes directors to be 'encouraged' to retain their
shareholdings, but there is no effective way in which this can be done.
Companies cannot force executives to retain their shares if they have been
obtained through a tax approved option scheme as the Inland Revenue regards
this restriction as contrary to the Taxes Act.
But a long-term CGT-free opportunity of, say, 10 years, would be exactly
what is required to promote share retention by executives. H M F Simpson,

FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No pact in Mauritius
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr NAVIN RAMGOOLAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was proud that Mauritius should emerge with such warm approval from
the pages of your newspaper (Survey, September 27).
The achievements of the Mauritian people since independence are such that
the nation can be justly proud of them. It is generally the lot of a small
country (as the recent experience of Haiti shows) only to come to
international attention after natural disasters or political strife. But the
success of Mauritius is underpinned by its people's belief in democracy and
law. It is the patient achievement of countless thousands of Mauritians,
often in spite of official discouragement. This success has not been created
in 10 years and cannot be claimed exclusively by the present government or
its prime minister.
Moreover, as your correspondents remark, underlying this improvement is a
serious and growing concern. For although the Mauritian people have not lost
faith in democracy, it is widely believed - from numerous instances - that
the government of Mauritius has.
At the last election in 1991, I called publicly for international observers
because I believed then that electoral malpractices were bound to occur. The
prime minister refused this request. I and others have renewed that call
because the dangers we perceived have not diminished. The prime minister has
recently announced, after strong pressure, some changes in the electoral
procedure which would help to safeguard its integrity. We do not believe
that is enough. Public confidence in the transparency of elections must be
fully preserved if improvements which your correspondents found on their
recent visit are to be maintained.
Finally, may I take this opportunity of stating that, contrary to what your
survey states, no pact between me and the prime minister, whereby the prime
minister would remain in office for several years, has been agreed, nor
would any such agreement be acceptable to me, the party I lead, or the vast
majority of the Mauritian people.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Contest for your conversation: Cable companies and BT are in
fierce competition in the UK telephone market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telephone calls in the UK are becoming as competitive as soap powders - and
the difference between rival 'brands' is about as great.
Last week saw the launch of two long-distance telecommunications networks.
Energis and NTL join Mercury and BT in Europe's most competitive
long-distance phone market.
But competition is also opening up for the first time the local telephone
market as across Britain cable companies dig up the streets, laying combined
cable television and telephone networks.
What does this rapid rise of cable telephony mean for the consumer? And does
it spell serious trouble for the future of British Telecommunications, which
until a decade ago had a complete monopoly over the UK's phone service?
BT proclaims the cable companies to be its most serious long-term threat. Mr
Michael Hepher, BT managing director, says: 'Whereas with Mercury we lose
the long-distance revenue but keep the line connection, with the cable
companies we lose not only the revenue but also the connection - and with it
the opportunity to sell and market all our services.'
His fears have foundation. The cable companies now boast more than 500,000
telephone customers, double the number a year ago. Although the cable
operators are generally called 'cable TV companies', this is a misnomer
since telephony is almost as important to them as television.
They are marketing the two services hand-in-hand, and revenue from both is
critical to the economics of laying a second cable into the home. Of the
three largest cable operators in the UK, Nynex is a regional phone operator
in the US, while the other two, Telewest and Bell Cablemedia, are joint
ventures between telecommunications and cable companies.
Analysts predict that by 2000 the cable companies will have installed nearly
5m phone lines - against BT's current total of 26m. Some cable operators
already have more telephone than TV subscribers. Nynex, the second largest
operator, claims that 25 per cent of the homes within its Portsmouth network
area now take cable telephone, against 22 per cent taking cable TV. A year
ago, 58 per cent of new customers were taking both products; now it is up to
70 per cent.
The social make-up of cable customers is changing too. In the early days,
when cable was clearly TV-led, it had strongest appeal in areas of
low-income housing, where the extra TV channels were especially popular.
Telephony is broadening cable's appeal. 'At the prosperous end of the
demographic continuum we are now selling well above average,' says Mr Peter
Lynch, director of residential marketing at Nynex. Sales are below average
among older residents, 'but it is more a concern about change, not a clear
socio-economic divide', he believes.
In response, BT has set up 'cable defence' teams to target urban areas where
cable companies are building their networks. It has also launched a
high-profile campaign to persuade the government to lift the ban preventing
it from carrying broadcast television across its network into homes.
BT executives are additionally concerned that, as price competition with
cable companies intensifies, BT will not be able to vary its prices
regionally as the cable companies do. BT is required by its licence to
charge the same for a local call in Portsmouth as in the large London
calling zone.
Yet BT probably protests too much.
Take prices. Cable companies invariably claim to be cheaper than BT. In
reality, however, they are often more expensive. Many customers are seduced
by initial savings on line rentals, which are invariably cheaper with cable
than BT, and by cable operators' claims that they are cheaper for a
'typical' residential phone bill.
Since the cable companies have different tariffs, it is impossible to
generalise. The chart compares the weekday residential tariffs of Videotron,
a cable operator covering much of London and Hampshire, with those of BT and
Mercury.
Videotron is more expensive than BT for many national calls made during the
day. Mercury - accessed through a BT line - is far cheaper than Videotron
for all long-distance calls. Moreover, Videotron's cheap rate starts much
later in the evening than that of BT or Mercury - an hour later for local
and national calls and two hours later for European calls. So Videotron
customers may unwittingly find themselves paying more than twice the BT rate
for a call unless they look at the detail behind the company's claim to be
'at least 10 per cent cheaper' than BT for a 'typical' bill.
BT is being forced to slash its prices by Oftel, the UK industry regulator.
In the process it is putting greater pressure on its competitors as they
seek to maintain price differentials. As the existing differential narrows,
so does the incentive for customers to switch from one supplier to another.
AT&amp;T, the largest US operator, has made great play of the trifling savings
to be made by switching to its competitors - and its discount plans,
available to most customers, are cleverly designed to boost loyalty. BT,
which last year forged an alliance with AT&amp;T's principal rival, MCI, is fast
learning the tricks of the US pricing and marketing trade.
The numbers of cable subscribers cited above also need to be put in
perspective. BT still has 85 per cent of the UK's telecoms market. It is
currently adding new lines at a faster rate than the cable companies: its
net monthly growth is about 60,000 lines, against less than 40,000 for the
cable companies. BT's mobile phone offshoot, Cellnet, has 1.2m subscribers -
more than twice as many as all cable phone users put together.
Furthermore, the ban on BT carrying entertainment is unlikely to endure
indefinitely. The House of Commons trade and industry select committee
recently urged the government to set a firm date of 2002 for lifting the ban
nationwide. The Cable Television Association accepts that the cable industry
has little to gain from continued uncertainty and supports an eventual end
to the ban.
The challenge for the cable companies is to become more than 'cheap BTs' in
their role as telecoms suppliers. On the residential side, pay-per-view and
video-on-demand services across telecoms wires are being tested, with
operators promising commercial services in the near future.
If the cable companies can provide interactive services giving customers
access to Hollywood movies and home shopping soon, they will steal a march
on BT. But dates are vague, and prices have yet to be revealed.
At the outset, cable operators concentrated on the residential market, where
joint marketing of TV and telephony appeared to have most to offer. However,
they are now also taking the business sector seriously. London's operators
have come together in a 'London Interconnect' consortium, offering data
communications services. Videotron, which holds a telephony franchise in
Westminster and the City, has launched a desktop television/information
service, upgrading personal computers with a card that gives users access,
on their screens, to TV channels and information databases such as a new
Reuters service.
But the corporate sector is the fiercest part of the telecoms market. It
will be an uphill struggle to win a big share of business against the many
new operators - most of them US-owned - building networks and offering
services.
That leaves the residential sector, where the cable companies are the only
phone operators besides BT with their own fixed networks. For the domestic
consumer, competition means greater downward pressure on prices and in time
a wider range of services - some compensation for the bulldozers blocking
the pavements.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: The market always wins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEPHEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan, in 'Calling the bond market bluff' (Economic Viewpoint,
September 29), is either not saying anything or he is saying something
wrong.
In judging whether anticipated levels of inflation require monetary
tightening, it is of course always tempting for any individual - not just
central bankers - to imagine that he or she has stumbled upon an indicator
which knows better than the market as a whole. No sensible person denies
that this is possible.
The real question is: which do you find, on average, to be more trustworthy
 -the combined judgment of thousands of such individuals, or that of one or
a few who have got themselves installed by politicians in central banks?
The Alan Greenspans of this world, who might actually see something on the
horizon that the rest of us miss, will unfortunately always be rare birds;
and nothing good can come of flattering central bankers that they share such
vision.
Mr Brittan should not need to be reminded that, on average, the daily
plebiscite of expert opinion that is a market will always beat any one guess
at what will happen next.
The principal danger of central banking is not that one might begin to
follow this opinion, 'as if it were the word of God' - it is rather the risk
of becoming too sure of one's own predictive abilities, and attempting to
play that mighty role oneself.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: High-speed rail still an option in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOSEPH S. SILIEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Richard Tomkins concluded in his article, 'Fast trains are a long time
coming' (August 29), that in the US 'it is now accepted that the private
sector alone will not build high-speed railways'.
His conclusion is correct. However, his assertion that the problem facing US
high-speed rail projects is that 'most Americans never take trains' is off
the mark. Where frequent, convenient, and comfortable service is offered,
Americans will ride trains in great numbers. This is evident on at least
four popular Amtrak routes - New York to Washington, New York to Albany,
Chicago to Milwaukee, and Los Angeles to San Diego. But the service must be
offered in order to attract passengers.
Over the past two decades, the US preoccupation with high-speed rail has
been focused on multi-billion dollar dedicated right-of-way solutions based
on the Japanese, French and German models. All of these projects, requiring
huge investments, have failed.
Neither the private nor the public sectors can or will raise the funds
necessary for such expensive undertakings. Operating high-speed rail service
on existing track has come to be recognised as an achievable solution. This
'incremental approach' is based on the successful Swedish model. Tomkins is
correct in saying this is not easily done. But combining service-proven tilt
trains like X 2000 with the upgrading of existing track, new signalling to
govern high-speed trains, improved crossing protection, even the addition of
entirely new track to increase capacity - all are affordable when compared
with the cost in dollars and in time of building new railroads for
high-speed trains.
The Northeast Corridor linking Boston, New York, and Washington will be the
first US high-speed rail corridor developed using the 'incremental
approach'. I believe that its inevitable success will be a model for other
projects around the US.

Ever since Chaliapin first sang the role, every operatic bass has wanted to
play Don Quixote. On Saturday, for its second production of the season,
English National Opera brings Massenet's 'Don Quichotte' to London for the
first time since 1912. A popular story, plus a subtle blend of comedy and
sentiment, has made this opera one of the composer's most enduring
successes. The producer at ENO is Ian Judge and the conductor Emmanuel Joel,
with Richard Van Allan tilting at the windmills in the title-role.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts: Wagner in period - London concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Performances on 'period' instruments are catching up with musical history. A
movement that initially concerned itself with Baroque and Classical
repertory has now encompassed the early Romantic period. Under Roger
Norrington, the London Classical Players have been steadily exploring the
19th century, and on Saturday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall they stepped
further into the 'unknown' with the culminating Romantic composer: Richard
Wagner.
The occasion was Norrington's 'Wagner Day', devised as an exploration of
German Romantic music parallel to the South Bank's Deutsche Romantik
exhibition. Its aims were more modest than his previous, celebrated
'Experience' weekends, and no attempt was made to cover the range of the
Hayward show - that would have meant playing Mozart through to Stockhausen.
Rather, Saturday's events focused on the half-century from the death of
Beethoven to that of Wagner, and we were restricted to small bites: two
talks and two short concerts of chamber music contrasting one early and one
late Romantic, Schubert and Liszt; there was no room to explore the darker
side of Wagner's Romanticism.
The revelations all came in the evening's concert, the first half of which
consisted of overtures by Beethoven (Coriolan), Weber (Freischutz),
Mendelssohn (Hebrides) and Schumann (Genoveva), played on instruments of the
mid-to-late 19th century, as Wagner would have heard them. After the
interval, Norrington picked up the threads with the Overture to Rienzi
(written in 1840, seven years before Genoveva), in a thrilling performance
where smaller-scale - though never under-nourished - climaxes were
punctuated by clanging cymbals and shrieking piccolo. Orchestra and
conductor clearly relished their new challenge, and communicated their sense
of discovery to the audience.
But giving Wagner the 'period' treatment means more than playing on gut
strings with no vibrato: since the composer's death, performances of his
music have become markedly slower, and Norrington's re-thinking of tempos
provided the greatest insights. By observing that the 6/8 time signature in
the Tristan Prelude means two beats per bar, Norrington got away from the
now-customary, cloying six, and in the process gave a performance full of
surging passion. In adhering to Wagner's own timing for the Meistersinger
Prelude, he produced a refreshing, animated account that underlined the
opera's comic spirit.
We also heard the Preludes to Parsifal and Act 3 of Lohengrin. Now we must
hear whole operas: arguments about the size of Wagner voices today would
perhaps be settled, and - were Norrington conducting - opera houses might
save on their overtime bills.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts: In defence of theatre - Director Richard Eyre warns
that the creeping virus of opportunism has infected one of the great glories
of British cultural life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EYRE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are a lot of good reasons for not going to the theatre. For a start,
you have to turn up on time and sit in the dark without talking for longish
periods. I know many people who find this an insupportable restriction of
their freedom. I once spoke to the financier James Goldsmith in the hope of
luring him into sponsoring a play at the National Theatre. 'I never go to
the theatre,' he said. 'My legs are too long.'
And I have a friend, a film director, who hates going to the theatre because
it is all in wide-shot. Many people prefer the cinema for its solitary,
dreamlike disengagement. John Updike says: 'I've never much enjoyed going to
plays. The unreality of painted people standing on a platform saying things
they've said to each other for months is more than I can overlook.'
For me this is missing the point; it is the re-creation that animates the
art and makes it unique. Theatre will always be unfashionable because of its
form, its need for order in narrative and in structure, and it will always
lag behind a society that is conspicuous for its formlessness. The theatre's
concern with the frailty of being human will always look defenceless when
set against Mad Max III, The Exterminator, or the confident certainties of
politics or journalism.
What I like about the theatre is precisely what some people hate about it. I
like being made to concentrate. I like the fallibility that goes hand in
hand with its immediacy. I like the fact that it happens in the present
tense, that it is vulnerable and it is changeable. I like its sense of
occasion, the communal event: going in as an individual and emerging as part
of a group. I like sharing time with strangers: a beginning and an end, a
sense of birth and a sense of death. And I like the singular combination of
magic and moral debate.
There is no art that uses time, space, gesture, movement, speech, colour,
costume, light and music in the way theatre does. It thrives on metaphor:
things stand for things rather than being the thing itself, a room becomes a
world, a group of characters a whole society. Theatre invokes the
astonishment of the unreal and the strange, magnified proportions that occur
naturally in childhood.
The British are supposed to have the finest theatre in the world, perhaps
because so many of the characteristics of the medium coincide with
characteristics of the nation. The theatre exploits ritual, processions,
ceremonies, hieratic behaviour and dressing up; it depends on adversarial
conflict, the stuff of our parliamentary and legal system, and it is
concerned with role-playing, which is second nature to a nation obsessed
with the signs and manners of class distinction, and inured to the
necessity, as a nation and as individuals, of pretending to be what you
aren't.
But today the theatre's ecology and economy have started to resemble those
of the country as a whole; it has become infected by the virus of
opportunism. A kind of impatience has grown: actors and directors who might
previously have been content to do a year or two in a repertory theatre have
begun to look anxiously for jobs in TV, in films, or the national companies,
and the previous de facto form of apprenticeship for actors in smaller
repertory theatres has started to disappear - as has the unspoken sense of
shared experience between theatres in Newcastle, Nottingham, Exeter,
Birmingham and London.
A feeling has grown like a debilitating fungus that maybe these theatres
aren't worth saving, and maybe this park serves no useful purpose, and maybe
this hospital should be closed down, and maybe we can't justify these
courses for adults, and maybe we don't need all these people who don't have
jobs and take up all this space and all this money.
I don't believe that it is possible to retrace the steps of the last few
years, to perform a sort of social surgery that would change our hearts and
minds. We are what we are, and it is we who have made our world as it is.
The gift of the post-war era was the promise of freedom: political, and
economic, and sexual. It was an illusion: we are prisoners of our own social
and economic structures.
But the fact we know it was an illusion shouldn't stop us from wanting a
better world with our limited resources. We are not a poor country. The
leading Romanian actor and director Ion Caramitru told me in shocked tones,
expecting my sympathetic support, that he had only 2 per cent of the public
spending budget of Romania to spend on culture. Ah, I said, if only we had
that much.
I always took Margaret Thatcher's dictum 'There's no such thing as society,'
as a figure of speech. I didn't realise that she was so literal, so serious,
and so determined to prove her proposition. Her legacy is a sort of
political epidemic, a determination to subject every organisation, every
institution, to ideological reform at best, abolition at worst, all driven
by the Three Horsemen of the contemporary Apocalypse: money, management and
marketing.
I'm not playing naive if I say that I really don't understand why the
government doesn't support the arts more fully, but then I'm no more able to
understand why the government can't see that education is the key to our
future, and that those who work in education might know as much about it as
the politicians. We mustn't let scepticism, cynicism, or apathy lead us to
be mute in the face of any attempts to dismantle those organisations and
institutions which were set up in the spirit of optimism and belief that
there is such a thing as society.

edition of Utopia and Other Places by Richard Eyre (Vintage Pounds 6.99, 220

The nation's appetite for crime series, factual or fictional, is
inexhaustible. That at least is the view of the television companies. The
Nick (Channel 4 at 9pm) is real life, a fly-on-the-wall documentary which
follows the force of Gipton station in Leeds as it patrols a large chunk of
the inner city. Camera teams follow both CID and the uniform branch as they
respond to emergencies. The idea has taken a firm grip in the US, where
virtually every police car has a cameraman in the back, and sadly it should
prove riveting viewing here.
Equally investigative is Panorama (BBC 1 9.30) where, to mark the opening of
the Labour Party Conference, Tony Blair is brought face to face with five
representatives of middle England who try and uncover what he stands for.
Alan Rickman (star of Truly, Madly, Deeply) is not a great one for self
promotion, but he is producing and raising the money for his latest venture,
Mesmer, about the 18th century pioneer of hypnotism. The late Dennis Potter
wrote the script and filming is under way in Hungary where BBC 2's cameras
catch up with him at 11.15.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Arts: Colourful Berlioz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY BYE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A decade or so ago the BBC Symphony Orchestra would probably have called its
exploration of the music of Hector Berlioz, which began in the Royal
Festival Hall on Saturday, simply 'Berlioz Series'. These days, in deference
to the marketing men, such projects have snappy titles, often only
tangentially relevant. In this case, however, the title 'Reinventing the
Orchestra' actually encapsulated Berlioz's achievement as a creator of
sounds and colours which until then had been essayed only tentatively by his
contemporaries.
For Berlioz, orchestration was an integral part of music. His artistic
intentions in the Symphonie fantastique - not least its autobiographical
content - were made explicit by the composer. Yet there is no sense in which
Berlioz's orchestral technique, even at this early stage in his career, lags
behind his poetic vision. He may have become more resourceful as he grew
older, as was evident by the nimbly delivered Corsair overture which began
the evening, but the orchestral effects of the Symphonie are precise, from
the Chiaroscuro delicacy of the opium-induced 'Reveries' to the brashly
scored nightmare of the 'Witches' Sabbath'. Given the hackneyed status of
the work, Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra turned in a
surprisingly fresh and powerful performance, notable for the assurance of
the solo instrumental contributions and the cohesion of the ensemble work.
Berlioz's legacy continues in the importance which many of today's composers
attach to sound as pure sensation. Future concerts in the series (7 and 10
October) will include works by two of Scandinavia's leading young composers,
Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho, already well known in the UK, for whom
colour is indispensable. On Saturday it was the turn of the Dutchman Tristan
Keuris, whose Concerto for Saxophone Quartet was receiving its belated
London premiere eight years after it was completed. Despatched with
virtuosity by its dedicatees, the Rascher Saxophone Quartet, it emerged as
an attractive, rumbustuous jeu d'esprit, overlong perhaps, but teeming with
incidental detail and displaying an orchestral facility of which Berlioz
himself might have been proud.

FT  03 OCT 94 / People: King of Soya, and Nightclubs - Olacyr de Moraes,
Brazilian entrepreneur, tells Angus Foster he wants to live a little
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great American industrialists of the last century started empires based
on railways, agriculture and construction. Olacyr de Moraes has gone one
better and in a different continent; one of Brazil's most powerful
businessmen, he has built an empire spanning all three.
In little more than 40 years he has turned his main company, Grupo
Itamarati, from a tiny transport firm into a sprawling conglomerate with an
annual turnover of more than Dollars 1bn. Known in Brazil as the King of
Soya, he is the world's biggest private producer of soyabean.
He owns one of the country's biggest construction companies. He is building
a private railway, which could eventually stretch for 3,000 miles and which
he hopes will open up Brazil's interior.
And now, at the age of 63, he is investing in telecoms, banking and power
generation.
Despite all this, meeting de Moraes is a bit of a surprise. Expecting a
strutting tycoon surrounded by maps of his dominions, the visitor finds,
instead, a quiet, initially shy man who easily could be mistaken for a
provincial bank manager.
And there are contradictions. Despite his (presumably) enormous wealth and
the success of his businesses, he does not seem content. Recently divorced,
he has earned another nickname - King of the Nightclubs - because of his
relationships with very pretty, much younger girlfriends.
'When you are single, you come to the conclusion you need to live a little,'
he says. 'Why should I live the life of a monk? I am still working the same
amount as before with the same responsibilities. Our businesses have never
done as well as they are now. In fact, I think going out with beautiful
women brings you luck.'
Born and brought up in Sao Paulo state, he started in business in 1947,
running a small delivery company in Sao Paulo with his father. Its clients
were mainly in construction; in 1957 after his father's death, de Moraes
decided to enter the industry as well.
His construction company, Constran, started with small projects, such as
building roads and housing. As economic growth accelerated, construction
became an important sector for successive democratic and military
governments. Constran prospered under both, and grew into one of Brazil's
biggest private companies.
From 1968, some of the profits from construction were diverted into
agriculture. Enormous mechanised farms were developed in the south-western
states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, at that stage thought to be
too far from Brazil's main markets to be viable.
These farms, up to 250,000 acres in size, needed irrigation and soil
correction to reduce acidity. Once prepared, however, they became extremely
productive and Itamarati moved from wheat to soya to cattle and sugar.
According to his public relations resume, de Moraes built Itamarati 'with
the talent and keenness of a great entrepreneur who has never hidden the
satisfaction that he has made an important contribution to the economic and
social development of Brazil'.
In person, the King of Soya tells it slightly differently. 'I've been
successful because of hard work. I started working when I was 12, always on
Saturdays and Sundays. It wasn't always wonderful. It was extremely
difficult. I worked hard.'
He says his main job now is to select the managers for each division rather
than be involved in day-to-day decisions: 'Each division is now highly
professionalised.' His son, Marcos Augusto, 27, is being groomed to take
over the group and is at present overseeing investments in telecoms and a
satellite joint venture.
Itamarati is still wholly family-owned, and de Moraes sees no chance of that
changing. 'It is a very big group and there is always some need for one part
to help another. For instance, profits from agriculture have gone towards
the infrastructure interests. We can do this because we are flexible. It
would be difficult if we had outside shareholders.'
The group will enter new businesses by providing some capital, but also rely
on joint venture partners for skills and finance. Infrastructure projects,
including telecoms and power stations, are key growth sectors for de Moraes.
He believes Brazil's government will be forced to withdraw from areas of the
economy it traditionally saw as strategic.
Later this year, for instance, the company will start operating two
hydro-electric power stations, a business which until 1990 was closed to the
private sector.
'The government no longer has the money to invest in areas like
telecommunications and energy. Public opinion is changing too, and not just
in Brazil. Where there is opposition, it comes from employees of the
state-owned firms or from companies wanting to keep their privileges. But
the Brazilian people have matured and the businessmen have changed, too.
Today, there is a growing realisation that we have to lower costs and become
more competitive.'
Itamarati's largest infrastructure project is also one of Latin America's
most ambitious. The company is building the Ferronorte railway which would
connect southern Brazil by rail to the Amazon and to interior states where
existing links are very poor.
The first section will run 200 miles inland from Sao Paulo state and is due
to open during the first half of 1996. Itamarati has provided more than half
the Dollars 625m needed for this.
Future stages would require more outside financing. Eventually, the railway
could carve through northern and western Brazil, at an estimated cost of
Dollars 2.5bn and, Itamarati estimates, make 2m sq km of farm land more
accessible.
He believes, with a hint of visionary zeal, that Brazil's western states
offer the same opportunities that were discovered in the US Midwest last
century.
De Moraes says that farmers along the line, who now use costly and
inefficient lorries, will immediately enjoy much cheaper and quicker
transport for their rice and soya harvests. Although the projected route of
the railway goes past Itamarati's farms, he says the project is important
for the whole region rather than just himself.
'Our involvement in the project was important; it drew attention to the
problems caused by the lack of infrastructure. But only a small proportion,
at most 10 per cent, of what is carried on the railway will be Itamarati
goods. The project is totally viable with or without the Itamarati group.'
Outsiders are sceptical about how far the railway will stretch, especially
given Brazil's habit of announcing huge projects which are never finished.
But they agree that, given de Moraes' record, it is unwise to be cynical.
Considering Itamarati's size and range of businesses, it is surprising that
the group has yet to develop outside Brazil.
De Moraes says he is now too old to consider a serious move abroad. He is
also convinced that there are better opportunities in Brazil and that the
country will soon stabilise its economy and rediscover growth. A new
currency, the real, was launched last July and has led to a sharp fall in
inflation, which had reached 50 per cent a month.
'The real has given people a glimpse of what it would be like to have a
stable Brazil,' he says. 'The country managed to grow even when there was
economic chaos. So imagine what could happen if we had stability; I think we
would have enormous development.'
Stability is a dream that he and countless other Brazilians have long
harboured. But the chaos in their lives has not dented their patriotism.
'If I could start again knowing what I know now, I'd be 50 times richer,' he
says. 'But I'd do it again in Brazil, which is still the best country in the
world from my perspective. It's just that the people are no good]' he says,
laughing for the first time.

FT  03 OCT 94 / People (News in the names): Ford's Devine gear-change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Devine must be something of a stranger at Ford's headquarters in
Deerborn, Michigan, writes Richard Waters.
In the last 17 of the 27 years he has been with the US motor company, Devine
has spent only six months in Deerborn.
Last week, though, he was propelled into Ford's top management team as chief
financial officer.
His rise comes from an unlikely direction. For the past six years he has
been head of First Nationwide Bank, an underperforming savings and loan
subsidiary, which Ford is in the process of selling.
First Nationwide is the US's fifth-biggest S&amp;L, having grown rapidly under
Devine. However, it hasn't turned a profit for three years - unlike the auto
maker's other, highly profitably financing and credit card units.
'Financial services have been a good business for some time - but the
regulated banking business wasn't a good one for Ford,' says Devine.
He is not specific about what went wrong, saying only that a
highly-regulated industry like banking did not fit Ford well.
Prior to the First Nationwide interlude, Devine's resume bore all the
hallmarks of someone who was being prepared for higher things. He had spent
time in Europe, where he rose to become controller of product development in
1981, and Asia, where he became president of Ford's Japanese business in
1986.
Given Ford's declared intention of integrating its different regional
operations, that experience should certainly help.
Meanwhile, says Devine, there is one underlying objective: 'We want to keep
the profit momentum up - we don't want any let-up.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / People (News in the names): Henry's growing hospitality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia's Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talaal limited his comments on last
week's purchase of a 25 per cent stake in the Four Seasons hotel chain to a
couple of plain-vanilla sentences in a press release, writes Bernard Simon.
He left the rest of the explaining to Chuck Henry, a former investment
banker who has emerged as chief dealmaker in propelling the prince into a
sizeable player in the international hospitality industry.
Henry, 41, describes himself as 'a consultant with a single client'. He met
Prince Al-Waleed a year ago, while he was a director with CS First Boston's
hotel and real-estate division, which was advising Accor, the French group,
and the prince on their (ultimately unsuccessful) bid for the Meridien hotel
chain.
Henry set up his own company, Hotel Capital Advisers, in New York last July.
He will supervise the prince's investment in Four Seasons.
It will come as no surprise if Henry emerges as one of the Saudi's two
nominees on the Four Seasons board. 'It's the hope of any investment banker
to stop being a middleman and start being a principal,' says Henry.
The Four Seasons deal comes on top of the 37-year old prince's investments
in Citicorp and Euro Disney, among others, which fit his preference for
capital-intensive, global businesses with strong brand names.
Henry also spearheaded the purchase last July of a 50 per cent stake in
Fairmont Hotels, a smallish, San Francisco-based chain.
According to Henry, Prince Al-Waleed's interest in the hospitality industry
was sparked two or three years ago.
'A lot of people' approached him to buy hotel properties during the
recession, when real-estate - especially hard-hit hotels - were out of
favour with investors.
The Four Seasons deal is unlikely to be either the prince's or Chuck Henry's
last foray into the hospitality industry; Henry says more are in the
pipeline.

FT  03 OCT 94 / People (News in the names): Maverick hunter of Swiss banking
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Martin Ebner, the maverick Swiss stockbroker who is trying to take control
of Union Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest bank, was recently
referred to as the 'George Soros of Switzerland'.
It is a fairly apt comparison. Such is the 49-year-old Ebner's reputation
for making big money for his clients that when he launched a new investment
fund last April - even in the midst of a Swiss stock market slump - he
pulled in SFr3bn within a couple of weeks.
Like Soros, he can also lose big sums. That fund launched in April, called
Stillhalter Vision, has just reported SFr240m in unrealised paper losses in
its first five months of activity.
But over the nine years since he left staid Bank J. Vontobel in Zurich, to
prove that the Zurich market was ready for a professional block trader,
Ebner has been phenomenally successful, both for himself and the dozen or so
institutions and wealthy individual clients he serves.
His broker-dealer BZ Bank, now one of the biggest players in the Swiss
market, achieved a profit of SFr161m last year, with a staff of only 19. BZ
Trust, his asset management arm, has some SFr10bn under management.
Ebner personally may now figure in lists of Switzerland's richest people,
but he remains an outsider by choice, refusing to join the Swiss Bankers
Association or to hobnob with Zurich's financial establishment.
Friends and foes alike concur that Ebner has an extraordinary nose for
market trends. 'A genius,' his former boss Hans-Dieter Vontobel says.
And he is widely respected for his willingness to take big risks - which he
does every day as a block trader in Switzerland's relatively illiquid equity
market.
But his advance on UBS has startled many. It is the first time he has shown
a taste for political, as well as financial, risks.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Media Futures: A monsoon that must not be missed - The
regrouping of Olivetti's multimedia side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Preparing for the multimedia revolution sometimes seems like putting a
bucket outside and waiting for a rainstorm to fill it: you can vary the size
and shape of the bucket, but you can't do much to encourage the rain.
The bucket which has just been put out by Olivetti, the Italian computer
group, is called Olivetti Telemedia, and the parent company is frank about
its early prospects.
'We have an idea of the supply (of products and services), but we don't yet
know what the demand will be like,' admitted Elserino Piol, Olivetti's
deputy chairman, at Telemedia's launch two weeks ago, although he ventured a
figure of Dollars 3,000bn as the potential size of the worldwide information
market.
In fact, Telemedia is a grouping of the Italian company's existing
receptacles for multimedia and telecommunications - including a number of
small international joint ventures but excluding the mobile telephone
venture, Omnitel-Pronto Italia, in which Olivetti has a large stake.
Those ventures include some which have been quietly working on multimedia
innovations for the last few years, and others formed only in the last few
months.
Thus the June alliance between Olivetti and Hughes Network Systems, a
subsidiary of General Motors of the US, to exploit the market for business
satellite communications in Europe now comes under the Telemedia umbrella.
So does the joint venture with Redgate Communications of the US, announced
in March, to produce electronic catalogues. But Telemedia will also include
Seva, the data services company set up in 1985, and the company's
well-established R&amp;D operations in Pisa and Cambridge, among others.
New operations are being added bit by bit. Last week, for instance, the
Italian company formally launched Italia Online, in collaboration with
Italy's business daily Il Sole 24 Ore, to provide personal computer users
with access to databanks worldwide.
Aware of the risks of developing a high technology system while neglecting
the software, Olivetti has also taken on Grant Perry, a presenter with CNN,
the cable television network, as head of new media initiatives to scout out
innovative programming for Telemedia.
At present, Olivetti describes Telemedia as 'a virtual company' - a network
of autonomous ventures with a common aim, which can be easily adapted to the
challenges ahead - and for the moment Telemedia will make only a small
virtual profit for Olivetti.
In 1994, Telemedia's components expect to turn over only L325bn (Pounds
132m), 40 per cent overseas, which compares with the group's turnover last
year of L8,612bn. Piol talks in terms of an initial investment of Dollars
50m (Pounds 32m) in Telemedia, compared with the Dollars 2bn which Omnitel's
shareholders will pump into the cellular telephone venture over the next
four years.
This does not mean that Olivetti's commitment to the multimedia sector is
half-hearted, but the company is still hamstrung, according to the company,
by regulatory obstacles. Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman and chief
executive, rarely misses an opportunity to press publicly for further
liberalisation of the telecoms sector and development of Europe's IT
infrastructure, and Piol takes up the same theme.
'At the moment there is not much scope to invest because of the regulatory
environment,' he said. Deregulation means breaking up monopolies and
creating a 'pluralistic, competitive market for networks and innovative
services,' according to Olivetti, and focusing regulatory efforts on the
distribution of scarce frequencies and the protection of free competition.
From the point of view of income, Telemedia and Omnitel-Pronto Italia are
still two empty boxes in a group structure still dominated by computer
products, systems and services.
But after two to three years of drought in the international computer
market, the Italian group knows that it cannot afford to miss the forecast
Dollars 3,000bn multimedia and telecoms monsoon.
As De Benedetti said in his report to shareholders earlier this year:
'Converging information technology and telecommunications is the new,
immense fast lane where Olivetti intends to operate.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Magic market for Microsoft - The world's
biggest software company has a mission to 'edutain'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bernard Vergnes, president of Microsoft Europe, describes his ambitions in
multimedia carefully. Without wanting to appear arrogant, he says, he wants
to be the leading supplier of educational and other programmes  - sometimes
known as 'edutainment' - published on CD-Rom. These are the building bricks
of the multimedia revolution.
Microsoft, the world's largest software company, helped pioneer the genre in
1992 with Musical Instruments, a CD-Rom ideally suited to demonstrating the
combination of text, video and quality sound which characterises multimedia
presentations.
Today, Musical Instruments still impresses but looks dated compared with
newer offerings such as The Magic School Bus, a series to be released
shortly. It is said to be Microsoft president Bill Gates's current
favourite, and features a yellow US school bus with driver and passengers
which can be shrunk to navigate through the digestive system in The Human
Body or the cosmos in The Solar System. Microsoft's best-selling Dinosaurs
of 18 months ago included five moving video clips; Dangerous Creatures, a
new release, has more than 100.
Vergnes, who has worked for Microsoft since 1983 and has been its European
president since 1990, believes that the domestic market for CD-Rom is about
to expand rapidly, especially in Europe. He reckons that personal computers
equipped for multimedia will reach the 'magic price' this Christmas at which
substantial domestic sales can be expected.
He defines that price as just below Pounds 1,000 in Britain or FFr10,000 in
France. For this, customers will get a PC built around a high-performance
Intel 486 or 'Pentium' chip with 16 megabytes of fast memory and a
300-megabyte hard disc together with a CD-Rom player and sound capabilities.
In France, he says, some 25 per cent of PC sales are now through
supermarkets. Carrefour, the large French chain, is marketing its own range
of five models, some of which can handle multimedia.
Microsoft is taking the home market seriously. It has some 500-600 people,
including educationists, psychologists and software specialists, in its
consumer group, and is spending just under Dollars 100m a year on developing
new titles. Sales are about Dollars 300m a year.
In total, Microsoft spends about Dollars 600m on research and development,
most of it on software, which brings a much greater financial return. 'We
are over-investing for the future in these areas,' says Vergnes.
Success in consumer markets is critical to Microsoft's plans. Its worldwide
sales - Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds 2.97bn) last year - comprise desktop
applications, PC operating systems, word processors, spreadsheets and
database managers. Revenue growth last year was 24 per cent.
However, Vergnes admits that 'the traditional PC software market will not
grow forever. One day, probably sooner rather than later, most desktops in
developed countries will have a PC with a complete suite of business
programs'.
The company plans to reach sales of Dollars 8bn by 1995-96, but Vergnes says
the extra Dollars 3bn will not come entirely from desktop applications.
'Unless we make at least Dollars 1bn from consumer products, we shall not
achieve our target.'
He is encouraged by research showing that each professional PC installed
leads to purchases of - on average - five software packages during its life.
But up to 15 purchases of software a year can be expected for domestic PCs
if the price is right. The consumer software division is turning out three
new titles a month.
The competition is not sitting idle. Microsoft's principal competitors,
Lotus Development Corporation and Novell, have their own consumer products
divisions. Recently Novell, the market leader in networking, announced a
series of home education CD-Roms focusing on reading, writing and
arithmetic.
Microsoft's ambitions in multimedia, however, range across the board. It is
spending about Dollars 120m a year on software for the digital superhighway
through its advanced consumer technology research group, an elite operation
headed by chief technologist Nathan Myhrvold and reporting directly to Bill
Gates.
Microsoft interprets the highway as an electronic pipeline into each home
able to convey an almost limitless stream of information. Database computers
or servers provide the data which is unscrambled by a black box on top of
the television set. Earlier this year Myhrvold's group announced 'Tiger':
video server software which Microsoft says is the first phase of a complex,
interactive video system.
It runs on conventional personal computers. According to Vergnes: 'We
believe that traditional PC technology will develop fast enough so that we
can build these servers from inexpensive hardware. We can share the
processing load between the network server and the set-top box which, after
all, is only a powerful personal computer.'
There is, thus, a close similarity between Microsoft's model of the
information superhighways and the modern data-processing concept of
client-server computing where server computers provide data to a network of
PCs.
Microsoft's latest operating software, Windows NT, is intended to manage
client-server networks. Indeed, Vergnes believes that business will be first
to find applications for the information superhighway, with domestic
applications following later.
He echoes Bill Gates's complaints that most multimedia trials involve only
video-on-demand (VOD) - the ability to call a video of choice to the TV
screen. While technically complex, he does not believe that VOD is a true
test of demand for multimedia services.
In consequence, Microsoft's own trials - to be held with the US company TCI
in Denver and Seattle next year - will be sophisticated and involve a range
of services. Example: Vergnes envisages an education forum where teachers
from a broad range of schools and colleges could exchange views and
experience.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Architecture: A shiver of excitement - Will the lottery
change the face of Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I strongly believe man cannot live by GDP alone . . . I would like to see
everyone in this country share in the opportunities that were once available
only to the privileged few.'
Those were not the words of Labour leader Tony Blair but of prime minister
John Major when he opened the English Heritage conference last month. He was
not talking about a radical re-arrangement of government spending plans but
pinning his hopes on the success of Britain's national lottery, starting
next month, which is expected to produce billions in revenue.
Part of these proceeds will be spent in five different areas, the five 'good
causes' - arts, sport, national heritage, charities and a fund to mark the
millennium. John Major is optimistic that enough ideas will be forthcoming
for ways to celebrate the millennium, and that 'a wave of creativity will be
unleashed'.
What is curious about the whole lottery process is that what has been
unleashed so far is a wave of bureaucracy and a cascade of commissariats,
commissions and committees.
There is also much uncertainty. Who will make the awkward choices about
criteria and quality that will determine the success or failure of an
application for lottery funds?
In fact, it all comes down to the five godfathers of the lottery: their
views and opinions are going to count, as are their prejudices and
preferences. The five godfathers are Lords Gowrie and Rothschild for arts
and heritage; David Seiff for charities; Rodney Walker for sport; and
Stephen Dorrell, who has the awesome responsibility for the millennium.
These five wise men will all receive more petitions and more advice than
they can sensibly stand. Their offices have already started to grow and all
five have spent a great deal of valuable time at seminars and struggling to
establish the best possible criteria to guide applicants for grants.
None of them has been particularly effective about letting the public know
what is going on, and none of them seems quite clear about the role of the
Office of the Lottery, inevitably known as Oflot. Presumably Oflot will keep
an eye on Camelot, the commercial operator of the lottery.
What is clear is that the majority of the cash is to be spent on capital
projects and that each project is expected to raise matching partnership
funding. This is a likely area of difficulty.
Mainly, capital projects means buildings, and there is a shiver of
architectural excitment running through the profession at the prospect of an
end to the dole queues of architects and builders.
It seems to me that while the heritage world will acquire funds to save more
buildings and more collections, the people who are really going to have the
most fun are the nine millennium commissioners who are engaged in what their
founding minister, Peter Brooke, called a 'unique and golden opportunity to
mark the year 2000 in grand style'.
Brooke was also rash enough to talk about providing additional landmarks of
very high quality. 'Landmark' is a dangerous term that is beyond definition,
and the new minister who chairs the commission, Stephen Dorrell, does not
seem quite so keen on it.
The nine commissioners are a curious bunch. Heather Couper is a lady
astronomer; Richard Dalkeith will one day be the 10th Duke of Buccleuch and
Queensbery; Robin Dixon is a bobsleigh champion and Northern Ireland
businessman; John Hall built a successful but hideous shopping mall called
Metroland in Gateshead; Simon Jenkins likes architecture and once edited The
Times; Michael Heseltine wanted to be prime minister and now runs the
Department of Trade and Industry; Michael Montague is a businessman
appointed to represent the political opposition; and Patricia Scotland is a
barrister and former member of the Race Relations Committee of the Bar
General Council. Their chairman, Stephen Dorrell, is secretary of state for
national heritage.
You are definitely missing out if you have not received a personal visit
from one or all of these commissioners.
They were decribed by their own office - rather charmingly - as 'a panel of
informed amateurs', and they are all desperate not to be responsible for the
sanctioning of any white elephants. They see themselves as the heirs of the
Victorians who built the Great Exhibition in 1851 and of the quiet
socialists of the 1950s who built the Festival of Britain.
They are rather anxious not to be seen to be creating monuments. They are
much more likely to fund the planting of a forest or the protection of a
species than build a cathedral to mark the 2,000th Christian year.
The national mood - I cannot speak for Michael Heseltine, who has a strong
streak of megalomania - would seem to be against monuments, and especially
against monuments to the egomania of architects.
The Eiffel Tower in Paris marked the centenary of the French revolution and
Sydney's Opera House was funded by a lottery. There have been hundreds of
great expositions since 1851. But the number of successful un-political
monuments in the world is very small.
By the end of next month you will be able to fill in an application form for
a grant for your very own millennium project. But the guidelines are not
quite prepared.
The last millennium in England was presided over by Ethelred the Unready.
With such a short time to go, will there be time for the commissioners to
come up with something really inspiring that could change the face of
Britain for ever? The whole thing is indeed a lottery.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel: Watch out, the drive ahead could be rough -
Eurotunnel's competitive challenges as it launches its Channel shuttle
service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operating company, will today begin carrying
car passengers through the Channel tunnel on its specially-designed shuttle
trains - nearly 18 months behind schedule.
The passenger car shuttles are the most important element in Eurotunnel's
strategy to wrest dominance of the cross-Channel market away from ferries.
The company confidently predicts that it will be transporting at least half
of all accompanied car journeys by the end of 1996.
But Eurotunnel's ambitions do not end there. While interest to date in car
shuttles has focused on their impact on tourist travel, Eurotunnel
commercial director Mr Christopher Garnett has also set his sights on
winning a share of the potentially lucrative business market.
Traditionally, businessmen have only taken a car across the Channel if they
had sales samples or equipment to carry. But improvements to the continental
motorway network have encouraged many executives to use their cars for more
general business travel.
Eurotunnel estimates that about 10 per cent of cross-Channel journeys are
made for business-related purposes, mostly by hovercraft. Both the
hovercraft and the Eurotunnel shuttle service are twice as fast as a ferry
crossing. Mr Garnett believes that most executives who put a premium on
speed will switch to the more comfortable shuttle ride. Business customers
could account for 15-20 per cent of all shuttle travellers, he says.
For the first six weeks of the new service, travel through the tunnel will
be by invitation only. Eurotunnel hopes to carry 60,000 passengers chosen
from among its shareholders - selected by ballot - and from the ranks of its
bankers, MPs, MEPs and the travel trade. The company hopes to win over
sceptics by impressing these opinion-formers before it launches its
'turn-up-and-go' service in November.
For the business traveller making a last-minute journey, Eurotunnel's
'no-booking service' will be a particular appeal. The frequency of the
shuttle departures - four an hour once the service reaches full capacity
sometime next year - should ensure few delays.
The actual journey for the motorist will be spent in a brightly-lit,
air-conditioned metal tube, as guests found out on a special shuttle launch
trip last Friday. The motorist drives down the length of the train and when
all vehicles have been accommodated, fire-proof shutters descend from the
ceiling. These shutters isolate the carriages, each of which has two decks
with room for five cars. Passengers can still move from carriage to
carriage, however, through doors alongside the shutters. Toilets are located
in every third carriage.
Unlike truck drivers, who may leave their cabs for a meal in a separate
carriage, car drivers must remain with their vehicles. There is little for
the traveller to do during the 35-minute journey except read.
The journey through the tunnel is smooth, even at top train speeds of 80mph.
The small carriage windows - there is, after all, nothing to see during the
underground part of the journey - combined with the comfortable ride mean
that travellers may not notice when the train actually dips into the tunnel.
The cost of the journey will not be disclosed until November when Eurotunnel
launches its 'turn-up-and-go' service, though the company does concede it is
likely to be comparable with the cost of a ferry crossing.
Ferry tariffs have stabilised recently after a bout of price-cutting in the
spring and early summer, but ferry companies will be watching Eurotunnel
closely to match its special offers. Both sides are keen to avoid a price
war; however, with Eurotunnel injecting considerable new capacity into the
cross-channel market, the competitors will be eager to grab market share.
Although the ferries have most to fear from the launch of the shuttle, it is
airlines which will initially be hit by the launch of fast Intercity
Eurostar services between London, Paris and Brussels. The railways of the
three countries which will operate this service have yet to announce a
starting date but it is expected to be no later than November. Demand for
seats on the Eurostar trains are expected to outstrip that for the shuttles.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel: More Choice in ex-Soviet states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One hotel group with far-ranging plans in Russia and elsewhere in the
Commonwealth of Independent States is the US-based Choice Hotels
International. Alain Ammar, its managing director in Europe, says that the
CIS offers 'great potential' for western hotel groups, because of a lack of
international two-, three- and four-star properties, writes Michael
Thompson-Noel.
However, the group's first Russian property will be a 272-unit, five-star,
city-centre hotel in the Petrogradskaya district of St Petersburg, close to
the Hermitage museum, which will be marketed primarily to international
business travellers.
The former Inter Hotel Petrograd is receiving a Dollars 60m facelift, due to
be completed by next autumn. It will reopen as the Clarion North Crown,
complete with 10 suites, two-room apartments, a business centre, conference
hall, nightclub and shopping mall. Room rates will be Dollars 250-Dollars
280 a night.
Choice Hotels International is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manor Care, the
US healthcare group, and describes itself as the world's largest
international hotel franchise business. It has 3,265 properties open or
being developed in 34 countries, which it markets under seven brands. Four
brands are used internationally: Clarion, Quality, Comfort and Sleep Inn.
The other three - Econo Lodge, Rodeway and Friendship Inn - are used only in
the US and Canada.
Four months ago, Choice signed an agreement with Contract Russia, a leading
hotel development and management company in the CIS. The agreement covers 15
CIS countries and envisages the development of 25 hotels under the Choice
umbrella by the end of 1998, and about 70 within 10 years. Its main target
is the two- and three-star segment.
Properties will be developed via a mix of conversions and new building,
concentrating initially on Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The early priorities
are St Petersburg, Moscow and Minsk. After that, says Choice, will come
Novisibirsk, a Siberian city, and Kazakhstan, the oil-and-mineral-rich
republic whose capital, Alma-Ata, already attracts business visitors.
Choice says that so far this year it has opened 35 hotels in seven western
European countries, including Spain, a new market, and has 58 more under
development in Britain, France, Germany, Norway and Portugal. As of last
week it had 250 hotels open or being readied in 10 European countries.
Contract Russia, based in Moscow, is a subsidiary of Contract Mullersafe
Industrie, a Russian financial holding company with interests in
engineering, construction, industrial equipment, sales and distribution, and
hotel development and management.
St Petersburg, which is expected to attract 3.5m visitors next year, has
about 30,000 hotel beds. But fewer than 3,000 of the city's hotel rooms,
says Choice, are up to international standard.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK's minister of state at the Foreign Office, Douglas Hogg, arrived in
Damascus yesterday for a three-day visit.
He has already visited Syria twice since London and Damascus resumed
relations in 1990 and British officials said the aim of this visit was 'to
keep up the relationship'.
Mr Hogg will have talks with his Syrian counterpart, Mr Nasser Qaddour, and
possibly with other ministers, especially those responsible for the economy.
The UK would like to expand its business relationship with Syria but British
companies face stiff competition from Italian, German and Japanese rivals.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 12,000 Italians waited for hours in pouring rain yesterday for a rare
chance to visit the Quirinal Palace, the hill-top residence of popes, kings
and - these days - presidents.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's daughter, Marianna, led the tours. The 16th
century palace atop one of Rome's seven hills was only rarely open to the
public, but now tours will be given for three hours every Sunday morning.
The Quirinal has served as home to three popes, four kings and, since 1947,
nine presidents who are head of state.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Thai flood alert
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Local authorities in Thailand's capital Bangkok have issued a flood warning
for October 6-11, when a combination of heavy rainfall and high tides in the
Gulf of Thailand could cause the Chao Phraya river to overflow.
Six months ago Bangkok was threatened by a severe water shortage, but
exceptionally heavy monsoon rains have more than remedied the drought.
Flooding caused by heavy rain sometimes brings Bangkok's already slow-moving
traffic to a complete stop for hours at a time.

<TEXT>
Iran's interior ministry has ordered private foreign exchange dealers to
stop conducting business or have their money confiscated, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday. The ministry said it was
acting because of repeated complaints about 'profiteering middlemen
illegally' issuing counterfeit money at unofficial exchanges. The central
bank said official exchange centers will be set up across the country to
sell foreign currency to travellers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A dangerous haze from thick smoke caused by Indonesian forest fires has been
blamed for at least one collision between ships in the seas between
Indonesia and Singapore. Air transport to Kalimantan has been paralysed by
the smoke since early last week while flights to Indonesia's industrial
island of Batam, near Singapore, have been disrupted. Malaysia's information
minister said at the weekend that Malaysia was prepared to help Indonesia
control the forest fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan. Pollution from the haze
has reached a hazardous level in Kuala Lumpur, the worst-hit area, officials
said.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Sport: Surprise and familiarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apparently there used to be horse racing near my home in London. Whenever I
walk down the hill at the Holland Park end of Ladbroke Grove, the ghosts of
horses seem to collect in the air around me and I seem to see the outline of
that vanished course. Yet I find it impossible to imagine the sport in
contemporary London, even in areas like Wimbledon.
Unlike greyhound racing, whose arenas were deliberately placed so as to be
accessible by bus, Tube or on foot, horse racing in London is not - except
in betting shops - a part of daily life.
London goes to it, of course. It is a vital part of it, sharpening it up
with new money and bright clothes and bookmaking skills. But the sport in
Britain stays in the possession of the countryside, and of those who dress
themselves in the down-trodden colours of the earth.
Despite the shiny social veneer that it frequently assumes, British horse
racing has a visceral connection with certain ancient, sentimental and
powerful images, in which noble animals run eternally across vast expanses
of land.
This deception gives the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, one of the world's
greatest races and run at Longchamp yesterday, tremendous fascination for
British race-goers. To them the Arc is, above all, an effusion of urbanity:
it belongs to Paris in a way that no British horse race belongs to a city.
Longchamp's setting in the Bois de Boulogne is green and leafy, but within
it we see the dusk and champagne colours of autumnal streets, and inhale the
scent of Gauloises. I had always wanted to go the Arc.
Nor was I disappointed. I should have been, so high were my expectations,
but the day's racing enchanted me with the combination of surprise and
familiarity I had hoped for.
Here was the beloved atmosphere of the sport: the beauty of horses tugging
at my heart, the lust for money snatching at my nerves, the breaths of
vulnerability and cynicism mingling in the air.
Here, too, finishing a close-up fourth for me in the Arc itself, was the
English-trained Ezzoud, my favourite, with his rolling eye contained within
its executioner's hood. And here was the British contingent, making up at
least one-third of the great crowd, making its own contribution to a
sophisticated scene.
It was good to be part of it, especially as it was unaccompanied by the
usual snobbish drag upon the spirit that one experiences at leading British
race meetings. Instead, there was the foreigness and the astringency I had
craved. The foolish air of uncertainty that descends upon, say, Royal Ascot,
where almost everyone present is dressed up to be something they are not -
that was nowhere to be found.
Instead, there was the mixture of pride and nonchalance which I always
associate with Paris. And the race itself was pure joy - so thrilling that I
almost wanted it over and done with.
The desire to stand in the paddock and see the best horses in Europe; the
desire to reach the grandstand and see the finest race in Europe; the desire
to race back and watch the presentation to the victorious Carnegie, owned by
Sheikh Mohammed of the ruling Maktoum family of Dubai - these accumulated
and overflowed.
After 12 previous failures in the Arc, Sheikh Mohammed went to war with four
runners, and the strategy paid handsomely. In a pulsating finish, Carnegie,
ridden by Thierry Jarnet and trained by Andre Fabre, held on by a short neck
from the 1993 French Derby winner Hernando (Cash Asmussen), with Apple Tree
a close third.
Carnegie had been fancied in France for the past three weeks and paid his
supporters 9-1 after gaining the lead in the last few seconds. First-place
prizemoney this year was Pounds 457,666. In addition to Carnegie, Fabre
trained the third- and fifth-place finishers. Carnegie is a three-year-old
son of the champion Irish-based stallion Sadler's Wells.
As the Arc reached its climax, I knew there was nowhere in the world that I
would rather have been, but this was an almost troubling feeling, since it
compelled me to attempt to extract more from the event than is perhaps
possible.
The locals, I felt, would not be doing that. For all its fame the Arc is, if
anything, a low-key occasion, centred on a race run in a park which just
happens to contain any number of classic race-winners.
Even if a comparable race were run in London's Hyde Park, it would be a very
different sort of occasion. The true charm of the Arc - the naturalness with
which it merges into its surroundings - would be impossible to reproduce in
London.
In a strange way, this also makes the Arc impossible to understand, so
impregnable is it compared with the almost touching excitability and
pretentions of British race-going. Despite this, or because of it, I have
never enjoyed a sporting event more.

Britain chugged on to the information superhighway last Friday with what is
claimed to be its first public trial of digital interactive television.
The trial is taking place in Cambridge and involves only 10 households at
present, but the intention is to extend it to more than 1,000 customers by
the end of next year. Customers are able to select from a menu of services
including movies, local news and weather. No charge is being made for the
trial, but the service should be fully commercial from mid-1996.
The trial is being run by a consortium including Anglia Television, ATM and
Cambridge Cable, and is led by Online Media, a member of the Acorn Computer
Group owned by Olivetti of Italy. Cambridge Cable has some 67,000 homes in
the Cambridge area on its fibre optic network.
Multimedia specialists are agreed that the Cambridge trial, although
small-scale, could prove a milestone for the multimedia industry.
Christopher Cowan, multimedia specialist with Andersen Consulting, said that
an important feature was the use of a technology called Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) to deliver multimedia services to the home.
ATM offers huge transmission capacity and is seen by many as the technology
that will underpin multimedia developments in the future.
Malcolm Bird, Online Media's chief executive, said the purpose of the trial
was to test ATM technology in the real world. A small selection of movies,
news reports, documentaries and educational programmes were available for
transmission.
A key component of the trial is the 'set-top box' responsible for decoding
the stream of digital information from the network and transforming it into
sound and pictures. The Online Media box uses a microprocessor built by
Advanced Risc Machines, in which Acorn has a significant stake.
Bird says there had been interest from potential content-providers including
Independent Television News, Woolworth and Philips Media. Woolworth was
providing an electronic shopping catalogue, although it was not yet possible
to use the system to order goods.

Hollywood brings its big guns to Britain this week. Forrest Gump and The
Lion King are the box-office phenomena of the year.
They have made Pounds  1/2 bn in America, and are still collecting.
Gump, a time-hopping fable starring Tom Hanks, offers 2 1/2 hours of
mind-boggling special effects: see our hero chat and shake hands with
President Kennedy in glorious trick news-footage] In turn, Lion reawakens
the Disney wildlife menagerie years after the studio first struck gold with
The Jungle Book.
Either of these family-appeal fantasies could end up giving Jurassic Park
(now on video) a run for its millions as the highest-grossing film ever, so
are we all entering second childhood?
Probably: since the third US hit now picking UK pockets - and for me the
best of them all - is Speed. It has Keanu Reeves, a bomb, a runaway bus and
the most ingeniously-wired suspense plot in years. For children, as the
publicists used to say, of all ages.
But then cinema is the place where we all go to lose years from our mental
ages.
When A Man Loves A Woman is one success story of the summer for grown-ups.
The powerful tale of a marriage wrecked by alcoholism is still showing in
movie houses across Britain. Go and see it, if only to decide how much money
to put on Meg Ryan for next year's best actress Oscar.
At London's National Film Theatre, no Oscars and no nine-figure revenues for
individual movies.
Instead: the annual Jewish Film Festival, opening with acclaimed French film
Mina Tannenbaum, and several programmes doing what the NFT does best:
guarding our audio-visual culture.
Look out for a 25th anniversary season of Monty Python memorabilia starting
this week: much of the now-classic material once thought lost from the TV
archives.
For VCR viewers, it is time to lay in stocks for the long evenings to come.
Tom Hanks is in Oscar-winning pre-Gump form in the video-released
Philadelphia, as a prejudice-battling Aids sufferer. Hearts Of Darkness is
an hypnotic feature-length documentary about the making of Apocalypse Now
(better than the movie, pace Mr Coppola).
And the newly-restored Gone With The Wind is a snip at Pounds 15. It works
out at 1p a minute if you end up - and why should you not? - watching it six
times.

American superstars REM make their contribution to the British interest rate
debate with the opening title of their new album, 'What's the Frequency,
Kenneth?' The rest of Monster (Warner Bros) marks a return to the group's
heavier style, which will disappoint those who appreciated the subtlety of
their recent material. There is still a freshness and originality about the
band which helps to explain their phenomenal success. However, tickets for
next spring's UK dates sold out swiftly.
The American composer Carlisle Floyd wrote his folkloric opera Susannah when
he was only 28. He has waited nearly 40 years since its first performance in
1955 to see its first studio recording, released this week by Virgin
Classics. Cheryl Studer and Samuel Ramey sing the leads, Kent Nagano
conducts the Orchestre de l'Opera de Lyon.
Admirers of mellow, country sounds - and there are more of them around than
ever - will enjoy new albums by two of the most sophisticated
singer-songwriters on the scene. Lyle Lovett's I Love Everybody (MCA) lies
firmly in the tradition of such Texan criers-into-their-beer as Townes Van
Zandt and the seminal Guy Clark. There is plenty of wit and quirkiness in
Lovett's material, never better demonstrated than in his complaint that he
just can't pick up a pretty girl no more. Mmmmm.
Nanci Griffith looks forward to her Royal Albert Hall dates next week
(October 10-12) with the release of Flyer (MCA), a pleasant collection of
tunes featuring some very worthy guests such as U2's Adam Clayton, Mark
Knopfler and The Chieftains.
Celebrations of The Carpenters' 25th anniversary (of their signing to their
record label) continue with Interpretations (A&amp;M), a 21-track collection of
other people's material, including Burt Bacharach's 'Close to You', John
Lennon and Paul McCartney's 'Ticket to Ride' and - less happily - Don Henley
and Glenn Frey's 'Desperado'.
Tchaikovsky's music for solo piano has tended to be over-shadowed by the
immense popularity of his Concerto No 1 in B flat minor. Mikhail Pletnev
tackles The Seasons and Six Pieces in a bright new recording on Virgin
Classics.

FT  03 OCT 94 / FT Guide to Plague and Other Infections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Outbreaks of plague in India have provoked panic in affected areas and
worldwide action to quarantine the country. Could a global epidemic be in
prospect?
Definitely not. There is no risk of anything like the past pandemics, such
as the Black Death of the mid-14th century and the Great Plague of 1665. The
disease is now preventable and curable. If the patient is treated with
tetracycline antibiotics when symptoms appear, there is almost always a
complete cure. Outbreaks can be prevented by ensuring reasonable standards
of public hygiene.
What is the risk of a plague epidemic in India?
The disease is extremely unlikely to return to the levels that were normal
before antibiotics brought it under control. Until 1950, plague killed about
20,000 Indians each year.
What should the Indian authorities do to control the outbreaks?
Most important is to ensure that adequate stocks of antibiotic are available
in the affected areas, together with health workers to dispense them to
those showing signs of infection. However, mass-administration of
antibiotics to the whole population of cities such as Surat and Delhi would
be a mistake, because it could lead to the evolution of drug-resistant
strains of the bacteria. The spread of the disease can be reduced by keeping
those infected in isolation hospitals.
Should other countries take action to prevent plague spreading outside
India?
Plague is already present in many parts of the world. The World Health
Organisation says that in 1992, the last full year for which figures are
available, 1,768 cases, including 198 deaths, were officially reported from
nine countries (including the US). Under-reporting means that the real
incidence of plague is probably much higher. Even so, it is sensible for
countries to take some precautions against Indian plague - for example, by
advising against travel to places directly affected by the outbreaks and by
ensuring than everyone arriving from India is aware of possible symptoms.
WHO says a comprehensive ban on travel to India is not justified.
If the world is over-reacting to the threat of plague, which infectious
diseases should we be worrying about?
Today's biggest killer is tuberculosis - responsible for 3m deaths a year
worldwide. Close behind is malaria, with 2m. Both are on the increase.
Other infections that kill many thousands of people a year include
dysentery, cholera, typhoid and Aids.
What about the future? Is there a threat of new germs emerging to threaten
world health?
Yes, microbiologists are becoming increasingly concerned about the
complacency of the western world and its assumption that medicine has won
the war on lethal infections. They fear that a variety of factors are
combining to set the stage for new killers to appear and old ones to
re-emerge. These include increased international travel, over-use of
antibiotics, and human disturbance of tropical forests (which are breeding
grounds for lethal new germs).
What sort of germs should we be most frightened of?
There is no way of predicting what is going to emerge. But most scientists
are more frightened of viruses than bacteria such as plague. Viruses can
reshuffle their genes and mutate more rapidly than bacteria, and the
pharmaceutical industry has few antiviral drugs with which to fight them,
even in the early stages of research.
What is the microbiologist's ultimate nightmare?
For some, a previously unknown monkey virus mutating into a new strain that
is virulent, untreatable and transmitted easily between humans. For others,
the fast-changing influenza virus emerging in a form more virulent than the
one that killed 20m people worldwide in 1918-19 and then mysteriously
disappeared.

Tomorrow: US baseball play-offs.
These should have started, but they won't, because of the players' strike
and the owners' cancellation of the season.
Baseball's enlarged, TV-friendly, eight-team play-offs were to have started
tomorrow, but no-one will turn up. Result: for the first time since 1904
there will be no World Series winners - just losers.
Golf: October 6-9: Alfred Dunhill Cup, St Andrews Old Course, Scotland.
An end-of-term feeling hangs over St Andrews for the 16-team tournament that
tries to duplicate the nationalist enthusiasm of the Ryder Cup. The cast
keeps changing but Fred Couples, Curtis Strange and Tom Kite are due to play
for the US, the defending champions.
Rugby league: October 5: Leeds vs Australia; October 8: Wigan vs Australia.
Australia, the most muscular operators in the tiny pond of international
rugby league, have arrived in Britain.
Their hosts have arranged the itinerary so that their best players meet the
Kangaroos often and early, softening-up the tourists.
This week Australia play Leeds, whose player-coach Ellery Hanley is the new
Great Britain coach, then Wigan, the world club champions.
Soccer: October 8: European championships: Estonia vs Italy, France vs
Romania, Armenia vs Cyprus. October 9: Latvia vs Portugal, Croatia vs
Lithuania.
Italy were brought down to earth after losing the World Cup final when
drawing with Slovenia in their first European championship qualifier.
They continue their tour of eastern Europe with a visit to Estonia where
their chief adversary will be their old fear of failure. But Italy can
benefit from the knowledge that they cannot top France's collapse in the
World Cup qualifiers in Paris last year.
France lost their last two home games - the second to Bulgaria by two late
goals - to surrender a place in the finals. Eric Cantona (above), now
France's captain, blamed Parisian fans. France play Saturday's game in St
Etienne, where they face erratic Romania, World Cup quarter-finalists, and
the ghosts of recent Balkan humiliations.
Rugby union: October 8: South Africa vs Argentina. Kitch Christie, the
unorthodox new South African coach, makes his debut, shaking-up the back
division and, perhaps, South Africa's traditional approach.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Management: Fuel for a more fiery future - Robert Corzine
examines the dawning of a new age at British Gas as it faces upheaval within
its main domestic business and the prospect of market share dropping sharply
once competition really hots up in 1996
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE

<TEXT>
The chief executive in charge of the most profitable parts of Europe's 13th
largest company has recently been exiled to a simple corner desk in a noisy,
computer-crammed, open plan office in Solihull near Birmingham. His coffee
comes in a flimsy plastic cup, but only when he takes the time to go to the
dispenser. When sitting at his desk his every word can be overheard by
nearby workers.
Visitors seeing his plight could easily mistake him for the classic victim
of a boardroom coup, sent packing from his serene riverside suite in London
to a provincial outpost.
But Harry Moulson, managing director of TransCo, the pipeline and gas
storage company at the heart of British Gas, is merely making a statement
about cultural change at a company in the midst of a restructuring and
re-orientation exercise of a scale and complexity rarely attempted.
Three years ago British Gas was a stable, some would say stuffy, monopoly
utility steeped in a public service ethos.
Today, after a series of government reviews and bruising battles with its
regulator and would-be rivals, the chill winds of market competition are
increasingly being felt. In particular, British Gas faces upheaval in its
main domestic business and the prospect of a sharp drop in market share once
competition is phased in, beginning in 1996.
The scale of the management challenge is formidable - 'unlike anything ever
attempted by a big multinational oil company,' according to one industry
observer close to the company. On top of a radical corporate restructuring -
in which it will shed its integrated status, along with 25,000 jobs, a full
third of its staff - the company is trying to secure a premier position in
the rapidly evolving but intensely competitive international gas industry.
As Richard Giordano, its new American chairman and Cedric Brown, chief
executive, emphasised last Thursday, however, a new structure and strategy
are worth little unless there is a wholesale change in corporate culture.
For most of its history British Gas has been a deeply inward-looking,
strongly hierarchical organisation, with as many as '13 management and
supervisory levels between the chief executive and the guy who dug holes in
the streets', according to Moulson, whose unit includes Pounds 19bn worth of
gas pipeline and storage assets.
The hierarchical structure was built around semi-autonomous 'gas generals',
who ruled the 12 regions into which the UK business was divided. Many of the
generals' lofty corner offices and private dining rooms at the old regional
headquarters now stand vacant, their occupants having fallen victim to the
decision last March to disband the regional structure in favour of five
national business units.
But have the bureaucratic, anti-competitive attitudes ascribed to the 'old
guard' withered with their passing?
Many of British Gas's competitors remain sceptical. At least that is the
message conveyed in their public statements aimed at the politicians who
have yet to decide whether to put forward the legislation needed to turn the
government's commitment to competition into a reality.
Others who deal closely with the company, including Clare Spottiswoode,
director general of Ofgas, the company's regulator, insist that there has
been a cultural change, at least at the highest levels.
She notes that senior executives in charge of the various business units
often assume conflicting positions in negotiations with Ofgas, with, for
example, the trading side of British Gas lining up against TransCo
executives.
Spottiswoode, who believes cultural change at British Gas is a prerequisite
to the effective introduction of competition in the domestic gas market,
wonders, however, whether the competitive spirit is being embraced further
down the ranks.
Senior British Gas executives share her concern. One recently commented that
'middle ranking managers are scared to death' of the changes taking place.
That is not surprising, given the fact that all employees are having to
re-apply for their jobs as part of the restructuring.
But leading the rank-and-file to the new competitive world also flies in the
face of the company's history.
'Employee empowerment' is hard to sell to a workforce which 'has spent the
last 30 years in a command and control environment,' admits Moulson.
That style of management can be traced to Sir Denis Rooke, the strong-willed
chairman who served from 1976 until he stepped down in favour of Bob Evans
in 1989.
His tenure was marked by substantial technical and engineering achievements,
not least of which was the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) conversion of 12m
households from manufactured coal gas to natural gas. At the time he
described the programme as 'perhaps the greatest peacetime operation in this
nation's history'. Sir Denis also helped to dispel public doubts about the
reliability and safety of gas as a fuel by emphasising a 'belt and braces'
approach to business.
Such an attitude befits a company in which serious failures can literally
blow up in management's face. But it also fostered a bureaucratic mentality
and an aversion to risk-taking.
'To avoid risks, you put in lots of traps,' says Moulson. He cites as an
example the long paper trail that until recently accompanied even the most
routine requests to authorise work on gas connections to commercial and
industrial customers. 'There were 28 handover points for the request, which
took an average of 27 days to process.'
That process has since been cut to six handover points within five days. But
other examples of the 'belt and braces' approach persist. A case in point is
the Central Area Transmission System gas terminal on Teeside, where the
first new connection to the high-pressure national gas transmission system
in 10 years is to be built. In the initial talks with the terminals
operators British Gas said it wanted to station a 10-person team in a
separate building on the site to oversee the connector. When questioned as
to why it needed such extensive facilities, British Gas simply said that was
the way it had always been done.
Steady persuasion by its partners eventually resulted in the company
acknowledging that the job could be done by one person sharing an office in
the existing administration building. Breaking down such entrenched
attitudes is a priority for the heads of the business units.
Moulson's decision to give up the private office and dining room may be a
largely symbolic gesture, but it sends a message that the old barriers to
communication between senior executives and their staff have come down.
'British Gas executives have traditionally not been very good at listening,'
notes Moulson. 'They were much better at telling.'
TransCo is well on its way to reducing the 13 management levels to just five
or six. But not all of Moulson's attempts to break down internal barriers
have succeeded. Many manual workers react to talk of 'empowerment' with
suspicion, even though Moulson tries to reassure them that it means nothing
more than 'having a go and trying different things'.
Many senior managers can also be uncomfortable with the more open style.
'All too often you ask someone what he thinks of an issue and the response
is: 'I can give you a paper on that',' bemoans Moulson.
The emphasis on 'openness' extends to TransCo's dealings with its customers,
which include the trading divisions of British Gas as well as the 30 or so
independent gas marketers. Last year many of the independents accused
TransCo of deliberately hindering their operations in the industrial and
commercial gas markets now open to competition. They believed it was part of
a campaign to block wider competition.
TransCo executives say those problems resulted from the speed at which the
competitors captured market share and from shortcomings in a technical
system which have now largely been overcome.
They also claim that the new commercial culture at Solihull has eradicated
the doubts and suspicions of all but a handful of the independents. They
concede, however, that many independents are less sure that the
anti-competitive attitudes have changed at the district level.
The transition from a cosy monopoly to the competitive market may be even
more wrenching for the 8,000 or so staff employed by Public Gas Supply, the
Staines-based business unit which will have to compete head-on with the
independent gas marketing companies when the domestic market of 18m
households is liberalised later this decade.
Mike Alexander, the PGS chief executive, is also cutting out many layers of
management. But unlike his counterpart at TransCo, whose workforce will
remain relatively stable, Alexander will have to slash personnel numbers in
order to come anywhere near to being competitive with the independents.
The need to cultivate a more commercial approach among PGS staff is if
anything more urgent, given the fierce competition expected from would-be
rivals.
In addition PGS, whose main function is to handle routine customer accounts
and complaints about their bills, is unlikely to find stability at the end
of the restructuring exercise.
Anne Hemmingway, head of the Southampton-based Southern division, says
employees often tell her what a relief it will be when the current round of
uncertainty over jobs and structural changes is behind them.
Her answer, she says, is always the same. 'What makes you think it's going
to to settle down?'
Senior PGS executives concede that instilling commercial attitudes in people
who freely admit that they joined British Gas for a quiet, orderly office
life and job security will not be easy.
'Our task is to get people buzzing,' says Hemmingway. That 'buzz' is evident
among the first supervisors in Southampton chosen to undergo a course that
will help them to 'allay the fears and stop the panic' among their more
junior colleagues.
In recent weeks they have spent most of their time in a room plastered with
posters extolling the virtues of customer care and employee empowerment.
They acknowledge that it may be a problem to persuade many junior staff to
take responsibility for even simple tasks, let alone convincing them to take
advantage of customer contacts as a possible 'selling opportunity'.
They also agree that many of their middle-ranking management colleagues may
not make the transition from supervisory roles to one in which the emphasis
is on 'coaching, counselling and assessing'.
It will be some months before executives know if the change in attitudes
which such words imply will take hold. There is little doubt, however, that
British Gas has at least begun the 'complete and radical transformation' of
the culture which Cedric Brown last week identified as a key to future
success.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Management: Mother knows how to manage best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I have just been sent some research by a pair of US doctors, both called
Rick, and both world experts on how to cope with difficult people at work.
As I read through the tactics they recommend for procrastinators, bullies
and whiners, I felt an odd sense of deja vu.
The account reminded me of another book, one which belongs not on the
management shelves but with the books on yoga and childbirth. It is a slim
volume called Getting on with Your Children. All the management techniques
are in it, and all are applicable to difficult workmates and to easy ones
too. There are sections on the destructive power of criticism, the
importance of praise, the need to listen, and on learning from mistakes. Its
account of how to make your children independent and responsible could be
transcribed word for word into one of those new books on empowerment.
Admittedly, the analogy is not perfect: it is not usually appropriate to
cuddle your workmates, nor can you confine your colleagues to their cots
when they become too tiresome. Equally you cannot fire your children; or
expect them to increase your family's revenues.
Still there are enough parallels to suggest that the best managers may not
be those pinstriped men who have had years in the boardroom and been on all
the right management courses. They may be mothers who have successfully
brought up large numbers of trying children. Anyone who can deal with a
manipulative three-year-old or a two-year-old throwing temper tantrums will
find even the worst varieties of wayward behaviour in the office a piece of
cake.
For over three decades management experts have been preaching ways of making
meetings more efficient. Yet so far their advice has not made a jot of
difference: the average manager still spends 40 per cent of every day in
meetings, and still complains that most of that is a frustrating waste of
time.
Fresh from the US comes a radical solution - the 'open space' meeting. This
turns all the old advice on its head: instead of sticking to an agenda, the
agenda is dispensed with altogether. Instead of keeping the session short,
these meetings last at least a day, and possibly three. Far from paring
numbers to the minimum, everyone is invited - 700 people would not be
considered too many at an open space gathering. During the meeting anyone
can pin up their ideas on a board and those who agree can sign up to them.
The session may then be subdivided into 'workshops' so that the ideas can be
thrashed out in more detail. According to Wikima Consulting, which is
attempting to import the idea into the UK, these meetings encourage
'unparalleled creativity, motivation and commitment'. Apparently they allow
companies to be rebuilt and conflicts to be resolved.
There are some peculiar management practices about, but this one takes the
biscuit. The Presbyterian Church in the US and the World Bank are great fans
of the open space meeting. But then one organisation has faith, and the
other is in such a bureaucratic muddle (a former employee said in the FT
last week that board members were mushrooms - kept in the dark and fed on
garbage) that any change is likely to be an improvement.
Some time ago I wrote about employees' evenings, strange occasions at which
workers gather with their bosses for a question and answer session over a
drink and a few peanuts. Here is an even odder concept: the customers'
evening. If you bank with Lloyds, you may have already received an
invitation to visit the local branch after hours, for a glass of wine and
the opportunity to tell them how you feel about the new open-plan branch
layout.
I can't think of anything I would like less than to spend a precious evening
visiting my bank to discuss whether the lighting is too bright or too dim.
Fortunately I am a customer of First Direct, so the question of lighting and
comportment of branch staff does not arise.
Yet it seems I am in a minority with my stand-offish attitude. So far Lloyds
has held over 1,000 of such evenings, making these branch booze ups one of
the most popular nights out across the country.
The bank says that perfectly normal people turn up: all ages, classes and
colours are represented, not just the people who write to newspapers in
block capitals or in green ink.
Surely all these people cannot be motivated by the free drink, nor by the
desire to see the other side of the cashier's glass screen. It seems our
banks have a special hold over us. Because they have the knack of making our
lives difficult by messing up our affairs and overcharging us, only to be
unbelievably slow to rectify matters, they turn the most laid back person
into a first rate moaner. There is a pleasure to be had in complaining to
the right person, so perhaps an invitation to make a night of it is not to
be scoffed at.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Frederick Winslow Taylor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Engineer, inventor, consultant and tennis champion, Taylor gave his name to
what was probably the first true international management movement.
Many of the Philadelphia Quaker's ideas on productivity and the organisation
of work have been discredited since his death in 1917. But the influence of
Taylorism can still be felt in modern management theories, not least the
currently fashionable business process re-engineering.
Taylor was obsessed by efficiency and measurement and set out to prove
scientifically that a machinist, for example, could produce a specific
quantity of output in a given time. At Midvale Steel Works - where he became
chief engineer in the 1880s - the jobs of foremen were redefined and a set
of clear procedures established for certain jobs. Stop watches were
distributed to the foremen as Taylor attempted to break down the work into
its component parts (an essential feature of latter day BPR).
In Principles of Scientific Management (1911) - a book based largely on his
experiences at Midvale and later at Bethlehem Steel and the most quoted
source of his ideas - Taylor argued that scientific methods should replace
the old rule of thumb ways in which workers operated; that workers should be
scientifically selected to be 'first class' at a particular task; and that
work should be equally divided between workers and management.
Taylor was also one of the first to develop the idea of payment by results,
introducing differential piece rates and achieving significant cost
reductions in the process. As John Mapes, senior lecturer in Operations
Management at Cranfield School of Management, points out, however, this part
of the legacy is less appreciated today. 'Taylor put the emphasis on output
rather than quality.'
Taylor's 'top down' thinking and tendency to think of employees mainly as
pairs of hands are also out of favour. He was never flavour of the month
with the trade unions, one of whose US leaders claimed that 'no tyrant or
slave-driver in the ecstasy of his most delirious dream ever sought to place
upon abject slaves a condition more repugnant'. Lyndall Urwick - an army
officer who read Principles in the first world war trenches and was inspired
to found a movement for scientific management  - remarked that the strength
of the union movement prevented Taylorism from being fully implemented in
Britain.
Historians like Peter Drucker maintain Taylor started out with
well-intentioned social rather than engineering or profit motives, and
improving workers' living standards was one of his central aims.
Taylor's talents were undeniable. He was a prolific inventor, taking out
over 100 patents for ideas. He won the US tennis doubles championship in
1881 and succeeded in getting the rules of baseball changed by proving that
over-arm bowling was more effective than under-arm.
This is the first of a new series.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Crackdown on Criminal Trading: Inside out - the Stock
Exchange goes on crusade / Robert Peston goes on campaign with the squad
that aims to make sure all deals are above board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A crusade is being launched by Mr Michael Lawrence, the London Stock
Exchange's chief executive, to make the market safer for investors who do
not have inside information. He is taking a series of measures to ensure
that anyone buying and selling shares through a London securities house will
not be severely disadvantaged if he or she has access only to published
information.
'The lack of certainty in the market (which makes it difficult for an
investor to make a rational investment decision) damages our reputation,' he
said. 'I want us to do all we can to ensure that the market is orderly.'
Part of the way to achieve that, he believes, is for the exchange to be
doubly vigilant in its attempt to detect and investigate possible insider
traders, or those who make illegal profits from trading in shares when in
possession of confidential price-sensitive information. But Mr Lawrence
admited: 'There is a limit to what we can do. We investigate, but it's up to
the Department of Trade and Industry to decide whether to prosecute'. In the
14 years since insider trading became illegal in the UK, there have been
just 23 successful prosecutions and only two in the past two years. Part of
the reason for this record is widely believed to lie in the criminal, as
opposed to civil, nature of the misdemeanour. A criminal case requires proof
beyond reasonable doubt. The requirement of proving that someone possessed
inside information when dealing - and then proving that the motive for the
transaction was to profit from that information and that there was no other
motive - has frequently proved impossible to fulfil. Only the government can
decide whether to introduce a new civil law, with a lower burden of proof,
to cover insider trading. But although the exchange cannot change the law,
it is not immune from the effects of the current one. Mr Lawrence said: 'My
concern is that the exchange itself is brought into disrepute if there is
not enough punishment.' All he can do for now is to improve the exchange's
own detection and investigation procedures, so as to expose as many insider
traders as possible. 'We do not want to have an image of London as a place
where insiders can trade easily and get away with it,' he said.
To provide an insight into the exchange's role in the battle against insider
trading, the articles below include a genuine insider-trading case - heavily
disguised with the names and dates changed because the investigation is
still 'live' - and a detailed account of the operations of the exchange's
Surveillance Group, responsible for detecting and investigating any criminal
activity linked to share trading.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Crackdown on Criminal Trading: A click of the mouse is all
it takes to track the share raiders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stockmarket's Big Brother, watcher of every share deal carried out in
London for signs of criminal activity, lives in a seedy suite of rooms on
the fourth floor of the Stock Exchange's dirty grey tower in the City.
If it were not for the presence of some spanking new computer hardware, it
could be the set of the 70s cop show The Sweeney, all plywood chairs and
threadbare synthetic multicoloured carpeting.
These are the offices of the 19 members of the Surveillance Group, whose
role is to identify possible insider deals, market manipulation or other
criminal activity involving share trading and also to carry out
investigations, which can last up to three months.
The task of identifying possible insider deals has always been mind-boggling
because of the vast number of share price movements or transactions which
have to be examined every day for possible breaches of trading rules as well
criminal activity. On a typical day, the exchange scrutinises between 1,000
and 1,200 such trading 'events'.
Inevitably, most of the cleverest insider dealers are not caught. But the
Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance System (Imas), a computerised tool
the exchange has been using since the end of last year, has made it harder
for insiders to hide.
According to unpublished figures, the exchange's surveillance group opened
101 cases for investigation in the first seven months of the year, of which
75 were into alleged insider trading. That compares with 100 investigations
in the whole of last year including 57 insider probes. However, in the nine
months to date, 18 insider trading case files have been passed to other
agencies such as the Department of Trade and Industry, the Securities and
Futures Authority and the Takeover Panel for further investigation -
compared with 15 in the whole of 1993.
The DTI, which has the power to launch its own insider dealing
investigations under the Financial Services Act and also decides whether to
prosecute, has received 10 referrals from the exchange so far this year. It
received seven in the whole of last year.
The rise in the surveillance group's investigation tally reflects
improvements in the detection rate, not in the incidence of the offence, the
exchange believes. The surveillance group, headed by Mr Mike Feltham, was
hampered for many years by slow and cumbersome methods for obtaining basic
share trading information from a variety of sources within the exchange. It
could frequently take a fortnight to collate and analyse all the relevant
data.
One effect of Imas has been to improve the quality of the analysis of
trading information, since the raw data and the trends can all be seen on
the same screen. At the click of a mouse, it provides:
The time of all transactions in any UK shares;
The name of the broker or marketmaker who carried out the deals;
The coded names of the clients who placed the orders;
A great variety of graphical information which allows trading patterns to be
identified.
Its more important benefit is that it has compressed the process of
identifying sinister trading patterns and who is behind them from weeks to
hours. 'The element of surprise is vital in obtaining a confession from an
insider trader', said one former member of the department. That requires the
suspect to be interviewed soon after the alleged offence took place. The
more time that elapses before this interview, the greater the risk that he
or she will be tipped off that a probe has commenced and will concoct an
apparently legitimate reason for trading.
A recent example of the speed with which the group can now complete its
probes was the case of alleged insider trading involving Lord Archer. After
the media group, MAI, made a takeover bid for Anglia Television in mid
January this year, the group carried out - as a matter of routine - an
analysis of Anglia share deals in the preceding weeks.
Within three days it had compiled a case file on the best-selling novelist's
orders to purchase 50,000 Anglia shares. It passed the file to the DTI,
which investigated the affair for five months before deciding not to
prosecute him.
The surveillance group typically measures its performance by reference to
its counterpart at the New York Stock Exchange, whose international
reputation in fighting insider trading is probably stronger. But Imas is in
one important respect superior. The NYSE does not have any electronic access
to information on investors who place share orders. Its computers show only
the securities firms which have carried out the deals on investors' behalf.
So the NYSE has to telephone the firms to get any investor details, which
brings with it the risk that the firm will tip off the probe target.
The group in London cannot obtain from Imas the names of investors behind
deals. But each investor is given a code by every broking firm which is a
member of the exchange, and Imas supplies these coded names. This allows the
group to establish trading patterns and possible links between transactions
without having to make any telephone calls.
The Imas information is not comprehensive, however. The group can match full
names to codes for only a limited number of investors, since there are
millions of different codes. It will frequently have to ring a broker in the
end to establish who placed a share order.
Another significant omission from Imas - and indeed from any electronic
information source in the exchange - is details of the enormous equity
exposures taken on by securities houses and their clients in the
over-the-counter derivatives market. These OTC positions can on occasion be
the dominant influence on a company's share price. But at the moment only
the Securities and Futures Authority collects detailed information on these
deals - which it passes to the group in response to requests.
Given the importance of price movements in generating probes - 67 of the
investigations in the first seven months of the year were to an extent
initiated by price 'jumps' - lack of access to derivatives market
information is quite a handicap.
As well as being a database and analytical tool, Imas is an early warning
system. It produces 'alerts' every time there is an unusual price jump, or a
substantial transaction, or unorthodox pricing by market makers - the
wholesalers of shares - or an apparent breach of the exchange's rules on the
reporting of transactions.
These alerts are initially scrutinised by the market supervision department,
which is responsible for making sure that trading rules are followed by
exchange members and that dealing remains 'orderly' or not excessively
volatile. But when it detects possible criminal activity, the surveillance
team takes over.
The 19-strong team is split roughly down the middle between the intelligence
gatherers, who operate Imas and collect information from other sources, and
investigators who conduct interviews of suspects and witnesses.
The intuition and experience of the intelligence gatherers, led by Mr Alan
Wilson, plays an important role in deciding which transactions should be
passed to the investigators for further scrutiny.
For example, substantial purchases of an FT-SE company's shares prior to a
price-sensitive announcement would probably not be considered sinister if
they had been carried out through a big securities house, such as Warburg
Securities, since Warburg is carrying out substantial deals continually.
However the group would almost certainly conduct further enquiries if a
minor Scottish broker, whose typical deals are small, were shown by Imas as
a substantial purchaser of that company's shares.
There is a split between those team members who think that its most valuable
tool is human intuition and those who place more of their faith in
computerised analysis. This battle may take a decisive turn in the coming
months with the integration of new computer software into Imas.
A prototype system, based on advanced artificial intelligence programmes
developed for the exchange by University College, London, has been able to
identify links between different share traders which were hitherto
impossible to establish. The model has for example uncovered possible
concert parties consisting of up to 15 different clients of a series of
securities firms, by noticing that groups of the 15 almost always trade in
the same securities at the same time, even if all 15 rarely trade together.
But establishing who traded in any particular case is only half of what the
group does. Before passing a dossier to the exchange, it needs to gather
evidence of why investors carried out particular transactions. Even if
trades in a company's shares ahead of an announcement turned out to be by
the company chairman's mother, that would still not be deemed sufficient
evidence to pass to the DTI. In most cases, the group's investigators would
interview the woman to ask her why she traded.
In around 70 per cent of the cases where the beneficiary of a suspicious
transaction is identified, he or she will be interviewed. 'It is the
exchange's job to try to establish whether information was passed and how it
was passed', said a former official.
Again this is very different from the NYSE, which never talks to any
outsiders. It passes only trading data to the Securities and Exchange
Commission, which then takes responsibility for all further investigation
including interviews.
The exchange's investigators behave very much like policemen. They are
trained in interviewing techniques and how to obtain testimony admissible in
court. Frequently they will caution interviewees, using the standard form of
words employed by the police.
Unlike the police, however, they very rarely meet an overtly hostile
response from interviewees. The investigators opening gambit of 'I am from
the Stock Exchange and I have come to ask you about some share deals you
carried out' is frequently met with at least a partial confession, according
to past and present officials.
However, evidence is far more difficult to obtain once any transaction is
routed through offshore financial centres. Switzerland is now co-operating
to an extent with UK insider dealing investigations and providing some
details of the beneficiaries of share trades carried out by Swiss banks.
But it remains almost impossible to establish the identity of anyone trading
though a nominee company in the Cayman Islands or the British Virgin
Islands.
Some brokers and fund managers question why the exchange should invest so
much time and money investigating insider trading, given that obtaining a
successful prosecution appears so difficult. One fund manager said: 'The
exchange is pretty good at investigating, but to what end? Sometimes I think
someone should do a cost benefit analysis on their surveillance unit. Is it
really worth the cost?'
The exchange's reply is that deterrence is not just about putting people in
prison or fining them heavily. One official said: 'You would be surprised
how often executives mysteriously resign from their companies after the
surveillance group has conducted a probe.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / Crackdown on Criminal Trading: Surveillance knights ride
into battle to secure fair fight for all investors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
1.1 On February 6 1994, Olde Humbugs, the manufacturer of traditional
English confectionery, put out a statement that it was in talks with
International Chocolate Bars (ICB), the Swiss-based foods multinational,
which were likely to lead to a merger of the two companies.
1.2 Following the announcement, Olde Humbug's share price jumped 40p to
270p. At the beginning of the year, the price had been 220p.
1.3 The Surveillance Group initiated a review of trading in Olde Humbug's
shares as it had been seen that there were a series of large transactions
ahead of the announcement.
A substantial number of trades had come from Scottish-based individuals and
had taken place through an Edinburgh stockbroking firm, McNose and Partners.
These transactions, most of them purchases, seemed anomalous, since McNose
had rarely in the past dealt in Olde Humbugs shares.
1.4 The biggest purchases, worth Pounds 10m in aggregate, were carried out
by McNose for two clients, Banque Internationale de Bruxelles, a
Brussels-based bank, and Mr Peter Punter, a well-known and successful
private investor.
The investigation
2.1 The department approached the Takeover Panel for information, given in
strictest confidence, about how long talks had been in progress between ICB
and Olde Humbugs. The two companies were also asked to supply timetables of
the events leading up to the announcement and who had been aware of the
negotiations.
2.2 Both companies agreed that the first significant event took place on
November 14 1993 when the chairmen of the two companies, Mr Ronald Chattie
(Olde Humbugs) and Mr Dieter Aufgang (ICB) met to explore the issue of a
possible merger.
2.3 On March 1, Chattie and Aufgang were interviewed separately at the
exchange. Both were taped. During the interviews, the names of those
identified at that date as having dealt prior to the merger announcement
were given to them, but none was known to either. They agreed to carry out
checks with their personnel records and suppliers.
2.4 The department carried out a more extensive review of transactions in
both companies' shares. On March 3 it established that Mr Ewan Side, an Olde
Humbug executive, had dealt in his company's shares as follows:
November 15 1993, bought 5,000 shares at 215p;
January 18 1994, bought 5,000 shares at 222p;
February 10 1994, sold 10,000 shares at 280p.
2.5 Although not a member of the Olde Humbugs board, he was aware of the
merger talks because of his role as corporate strategist.
2.6 On March 10 two exchange investigators met Chattie and Ron Desktop, his
finance director, at Olde Humbug's offices in Leicester. The purpose of the
meeting was to find out the nature of Side's involvement in the talks with
ICB.
Chattie said Side as corporate strategist was kept closely informed of the
talks with ICB and was present at several of the negotiating meetings. He
recalled that in early December he warned Side not to buy any shares. Side
had not been brought onside (made an insider) in any other transaction as
this was the first time the company had been in merger discussions. Chattie
said he did not feel uncomfortable about discussing the business with him.
Chattie had also checked the company's records against the names of Olde
Humbugs share purchasers mentioned at the original meeting in the exchange.
He had found that Bernard Arrowroot of Gumme Group was a supplier to Arthur
Crystal of Sugar Products which in turn was a supplier to Olde Humbugs.
Arrowroot had purchased 10,000 Olde Humbug shares in January.
Chattie said that he knew that Side and Crystal were friends and had been
shooting together in December.
2.6 Owing to the senior position of Side within the company and the
information supplied by Chattie, it was felt necessary to interview Side at
the earliest opportunity. It was therefore decided to interview him the next
morning.
2.7 On March 11 at 09.05, two exchange investigators met Side at Olde
Humbug's offices. They explained the purpose of wanting to speak to him and
that he might wish to consider speaking to his solicitor before continuing.
Side left at 9.16, returned at 9.25 and informed them that his solicitor
would be attending any interview.
At 10.11 Side returned and introduced his solicitor, who said he had advised
his client to co-operate fully. At 10.15 the interview, which was taped,
commenced. Following introductions, Side was cautioned. The first tape ended
at 10.45. The second tape commenced at 10.46 and concluded at 11.01.
Side confirmed that he had dealt in Olde Humbug's shares as identified by
the surveillance department. He denied being told of the bid approach prior
to his purchase of 5,000 shares on November 15. The reason given for the
purchase was that Crystal, an old friend, had recently joined Sugar Products
and he hoped that they would be able to work together in developing and
expanding commercial links between the two companies.
Side admitted that the purchase on 18 January of 5,000 shares at 14.14 was
prompted by his being told by Chattie that a deal with ICB was likely. He
said he did not know if the information was public.
He denied discussing the bid talks with anyone outside the company. He
confirmed he had been shooting with Crystal in December. The names of other
people who had dealt were put to him. He said Punter had been in the same
shooting party as Crystal and himself, although they had not previously been
acquainted and they talked little during the weekend.
Side said the deals were tiny in comparison to his portfolio of Pounds 3m
invested in the stockmarket. At the end of the interview, he was handed a
notice explaining how he could get access to the tapes. His solicitors were
supplied with a copy of the tapes on April 10.
2.8 In the light of Side's admission that he had bought because of the
information he had obtained from Chattie, it was decided to attempt to
establish the conduit of any other information to the suspicious dealers in
Scotland and also in particular to Punter and Banque Internationale de
Bruxelles.
The department then wrote to the Belgian bank asking for whom it had bought
the Olde Humbugs shares. The bank supplied the name of a Liechtenstein-based
stiftung or trust. A letter was sent to the trust requesting details of its
beneficiary.
2.9 An apparent link from Olde Humbug to Punter was Crystal, who agreed to
be met at a hotel in Glasgow on April 5. He was interviewed there at 16.15.
He confirmed he knew Side both socially and through business. He said he was
not told that Olde Humbug was considering merging with ICB. Crystal freely
admitted that he recommends ICB's shares as he thinks it is a good business,
but he was adamant he had not heard about any merger activity. He confirmed
that Arrowroot of Gumme was one of his more important suppliers.
He was also asked if he had heard of Punter. He said he knew him and dealt
with him on business matters. He described him as someone who would buy and
sell anything. He knew that Punter was very active on the stockmarket as
every time he went to Punter's office he was always on the telephone to his
broker. Punter was well aware of Crystal's relationship with Olde Humbug and
frequently asked how the company was doing. Crystal has recommended Olde
Humbug's shares to Punter.
2.10 On April 15, Chattie telephoned the department to say that he had
become convinced that Side had breached his trust. During this conversation
it was established that Side had resigned following advice from his lawyer.
Conclusion
3.1 There is evidence of insider dealing by Side and consideration should be
given to referring this matter to the DTI. The large transactions by the
various connected dealers in Scotland and those of the Liechtenstein trust
may also be of interest. Punter has been interviewed by this department on
previous occasions. No attempt has been made to interview him this time.

Labour will this week reaffirm its policy on quotas for women in spite of
growing opposition.
However, a statement from the national executive committee yesterday said
the policy should be interpreted flexibly and with sensitivity. Where there

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Nuclear stance under threat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unions representing nuclear power workers will tomorrow attempt to throw out
the report of the party's commission on the environment, which they claim
has been 'packed' with supporters of Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace.
The report states that the party has resolved to phase out nuclear power.
But the unions - the AEEU, the GMB and TGWU - say this has not yet been
resolved in Labour's forthcoming review of energy policy. The GMB will
abstain when the report comes before the conference tomorrow. Mr Bill
Jordan, president of the AEEU, said his union would definitely vote against
the report. The TGWU general union will probably vote for the report,
arguing that other motions before the conference will qualify the report's
anti-nuclear bias.

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Pledge on Irish unity diluted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Labour's ruling national executive committee yesterday endorsed Mr Tony
Blair's efforts to water down the party's 13-year-old commitment to campaign
for Irish unity, Kevin Brown writes.
In a statement after its last pre-conference meeting, the NEC explicitly
accepted the right of Northern Ireland's majority population to veto
constitutional change.
The NEC also accepted a compromise resolution dropping much of the
nationalist rhetoric in a series of motions submitted before the IRA had
announced its ceasefire.
But it bowed to the continuing strength of the party's nationalist wing by
stressing that the 1981 commitment to Irish unity by consent remains a
long-term goal.
The statement brings the NEC into line with the neutral approach to Northern
Ireland developed by Mr Blair. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, is to
meet Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, on
US television tomorrow night, Jurek Martin writes from Washington.
The White House and British embassy both said yesterday that he was also
likely to meet Ms Nancy Soderberg of the National Security Council staff at
a social event tonight. It was not clear if he would meet Mr Anthony Lake,
the national security adviser.

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: New lyrics written for an old
song - The shadow chancellor tells Philip Stephens about strategies to boost
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gordon Brown calls it the 'New Economics'. It is not new. But for his
party the approach certainly is different.
Last week saw the shadow chancellor join Mr Tony Blair in ditching the
party's traditional assumption that higher spending and taxes would solve
the economy's problems.
Neither man will produce detailed tax tables this far ahead of a general
election. But apart from the 'undeserving rich' (no-one is quite sure who
they are, although the bosses of the newly privatised utilities seem one
obvious choice), Mr Brown's message is that the nation's taxpayers can sleep
soundly.
Convinced that the break with the past has now been made, Mr Brown wants to
move on to a more positive agenda - explaining what Labour would do rather
than what it would not.
The thread running through his efforts to present a credible strategy at the
next general election is the diagnosis that under-investment is the key to
the UK's economic weakness.
In an interview with the Financial Times on the eve of today's conference
debate on the economy, Mr Brown offered Labour's answer: a framework for the
economy in which the productive base would be rebuilt by a government
working with rather than against the private sector.
The idea that Britain has for too long lived for the short term is hardly
novel. Politicians and economists have spent much of the past 30 years
telling us of the dangers of preferring today's consumption to tomorrow's
investment.
Nor is there anything new about the idea that the nation's education system
is no match for that of the Japanese or the Germans; or that British
companies often prefer hefty dividend payments to long-term expansion
programmes.
What has changed is Labour's prescription. State direction and ownership,
like high spending and punitive taxes, Mr Brown insists, are no longer part
of Labour's agenda.
The message he wants the voters - and business - to take came in the first
sentence of the interview: 'I think the key thing is for people to
understand that Labour is setting aside the old conflicts between the public
and private sectors. We see a partnership that is essential to the
regeneration for the economy.'
The Tories have failed because they have presided over an ever-shrinking
productive base. For the same reason Labour could not solve the problems by
pumping up demand. It would hit the same capacity constraints. The supply
side rules in Mr Brown's 'New Economics'.
The shadow chancellor is not offering a blueprint for the promised
transformation. The details of proposals to expand training, change the
culture of short-termism in the City and raise the level of industrial
investment must await the deliberations of party's Economic Commission.
But he sketched out the main elements of what amount to a series of carrots
and sticks to influence industry: 'We are looking at the merits of an
employer rebate/levy scheme to encourage training. We are looking at how we
can re-gear industrial and regional incentives so that they have a far
bigger component for investment in skills. We are looking at the idea of
individual training accounts and at major reform of National Insurance in
terms of the benefits people could expect for the same contributions.'
There is more: a university for industry and the possibility of tax
incentives to encourage pension funds and companies to enter into voluntary
long-term investment arrangements which would ease the pressure for large
dividends.
Labour would tighten competition policy by introducing public-interest
criteria for mergers and takeovers. It might form a development bank to help
small companies.
Alongside these proposals, Mr Brown is suggesting that the scope for
partnerships between the public and private sectors to improve the nation's
economic fabric could stretch well beyond traditional areas such as
transport. Inner-city regeneration, training and defence industry
diversification all look promising areas.
It is easy to spot the sticks and carrots. Employers would have to pay the
training levy. Rebates would depend on their performance in improving
skills. The system would 'encourage people to do what they would otherwise
consider doing themselves. It stops the good firms being undermined by the
bad so there is a case for intervention.'
Alongside this is the carrot provided by a plan to use the National
Insurance system to provide individuals with training credits - credits
which could be drawn while in work as well as between jobs.
New competition rules fall into the stick category. A public-interest
judgment on mergers and takeovers is 'very much part of our industrial
strategy'. The problem is that 'Britain has too few successful companies'.
But Mr Brown recognises the constraints on this particular assault. European
Union rules limit freedom for action and: 'Of course we recognise also that
there are many takeovers or mergers that are actually in the public
interest.'
There is also pressure on companies that are potential takeover targets to
pay high dividends rather than re-invest more of their surpluses: 'I think
it is true to say that Pounds 14 is invested for every Pounds 1 paid in
dividends in Japan but only Pounds 3 sterling is invested for every Pounds 1
paid in dividends in Britain.'
It is here that Mr Brown hints that Labour would keep stamp duty on share
transactions. But another proposal - the encouragement of long-term
investment agreements - would be on an entirely voluntary basis. If tax
incentives pushed shareholders and company boards into taking a long-term
view of their mutual interest, it would be money well spent.
Sir David Walker suggested something along the same lines when he headed the
Securities and Investments Board. The partnership theme returns, but this
time it is between finance and industry.
Overall it is not a strategy likely to bring the rank and file members to
their feet during today's debate. To do that Mr Brown will return to more
traditional themes such as boardroom greed. But Labour's 'new economics' is
a departure. The party has come terms with capitalism and is considering how
to make it work rather than dismantling it.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Leftwingers step up attack on 'modernising tendency'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leftwing activists including MPs Mr Tony Benn and Mr Dennis Skinner
repeatedly attacked Mr Tony Blair and his 'modernising tendency' at a
pre-conference rally yesterday staged by the Campaign for Labour Party
Democracy. Mr Benn insisted: 'Don't believe that selling out wins votes.'
They enthusiastically endorsed demands for higher taxes on the rich, the
introduction of a minimum wage, the renationalisation of privatised
industries and the repeal of all Tory anti-union laws.
Reality briefly intruded when Mr Skinner, MP for Bolsover, gave an account
of the meeting held by the national executive to decide its approach to the
policy issues to be debated by the conference.
His disclosure that an attempt to restore a bigger role to the unions in the
formulation of policy had been defeated by 25 votes to two underlined the
decline in the left's influence on the party leadership.
The two votes against came from Mr Skinner and Mr Benn, the former cabinet
minister and MP for Chesterfield. Both made what is expected to be a brief
return to the national executive on the strength of votes cast at last
year's conference to fill the vacancies created by the election of Mr Blair
as leader and Mr John Prescott as his deputy.
Mr Neil Kinnock, the former party leader, later dismissed the activities of
the 'temporary replacements' as nothing more than echoes from the past.
The decisions reached by the national executive were seized on by Mr Skinner
as further justification for a show of strength by constituency delegates at
the conference. He said: 'Don't get worried about the leadership - remember
that we represent class interests.' Mr Skinner called for a commitment to a
minimum wage of 'at least Pounds 4 per hour'. He added: 'If they ask where
the money is coming from let us tell them 'the richest 10 per cent'.'
Mr Benn deplored the shift in power away from the membership of the party
and the annual conference to the parliamentary Labour party 'to the
exclusion of people outside the House of Commons'.
He said the party had never achieved an election victory under a
'moderniser'.
These included Hugh Gaitskell, Lord Callaghan, Mr Kinnock and Mr Michael
Foot, who had been a 'sort of moderniser'.
Mrs Alice Mahon, MP for Halifax, said the national executive had become a
'mirror image of the shadow cabinet'.
She said the executive could not be trusted to honour the socialist
commitment to clause four of the party's constitution which advocates common
ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.
In a speech to the Labour economic strategies group, Mr Peter Shore, the
former cabinet minister and ex-shadow chancellor, warned that an effective
incomes policy, whether voluntary or statutory, would be needed to return to
anything approaching full employment.
He complained that the Labour leadership had 'virtually nothing to say'
about the successful demand management which would be required to bring
Britain's idle plant and idle hands into fuller use.

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Unions stress block nature of
delegates' single votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The leaders of the largest unions inflicted a severe embarrassment on Mr
Tony Blair last night by insisting that the abolition of their block votes
did not mean their delegates could vote as individuals at Labour's annual
conference.
They stressed that the delegates were mandated collectively by their unions
to vote in line with union policy.
Under new rules which came into force this year to modernise the party, the
block vote has been abolished. Every delegate to the conference, including
those in the unions, is now entitled to vote individually.
A party circular released yesterday said: 'There will be no block voting at
this year's conference; it will be a matter for individual delegates to
decide how they cast their vote. For the first time every delegate to
conference will be issued with a separate bar-coded voting card for card
votes.'
Mr Larry Whitty, Labour's general secretary, said last night: 'This is a
major and dramatic breakthrough', but he added: 'The intention was not to
preclude mandating delegates where they are bound by a union policy.'
The 27 unions affiliated to Labour still have 70 per cent or 4m of the votes
to be cast in the party conference.
Senior union leaders made clear last night that their delegates might all
have individual voting cards, but they would vote to back the collective
decisions of their unions. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB
general union, said that his union's delegates were at the conference 'to
represent the views and policies of the GMB. They have no mandate to do
anything else'.
He added: 'It would be unthinkable for somebody to come here and cast a vote
against GMB policy.'
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said: 'We will
expect every delegate to cast their votes strictly in line with the policy
of our union. We have decided collectively how the individuals on our
delegation will be voting. Nobody here for the TGWU represents themselves as
an individual.'
The same view was also expressed by Mr Paul Gallagher, the rightwing general
secretary of the AEEU engineering union. He said: 'Our delegates will be
free to vote any way they wish unless the issue being debated is a matter of
union policy, already decided by a much wider democratic process, a
conference of lay members.'
Later his union backtracked when Mr Bill Jordan, the AEEU president, denied
that the delegates were mandated and said they would be allowed to vote
individually.
Mr John Maples, Conservative party vice-chairman, attacked the move as
showing that in spite of the reforms, 'the union bosses are back controlling
the conference'.

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Portillo disdains minimum
wage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservatives last night launched a renewed onslaught on Labour's plans
for a national minimum wage as unions signalled their determination to
ensure that the party fixes a specific rate before the next election.
Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, anticipated today's Labour
conference debate on the issue by releasing a long dossier of independent
analyses which he said reinforced the Tories' case that a minimum wage would
destroy jobs.
Advocacy of a minimum wage demonstrated that Labour's modernisation claims
were fraudulent, he continued. Such a measure would 'drive up inflation and
could cost up to 2m jobs, harming the very people we should be trying to
help'.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, will reaffirm during the debate the
party's commitment to the principle of a minimum wage. But at the insistence
of Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, the motions supported by the leadership
make no mention of a specific figure.
Mr Blair has made clear that he wants to wait until much closer to the
election before making any specific commitment and has refused to endorse
the formula favoured by the unions of a rate fixed to half median male
earnings.
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union with 825,000
affiliated votes at the conference, said his union wanted to reaffirm the
existing position as laid out in policy documents published before the 1992
general election. 'On today's figures this would amount to a statutory
minimum wage of Pounds 4.05 an hour,' he said.
Mr John Edmonds, the GMB general union's general secretary, said the party's
existing minimum-wage policy would stand 'until it is changed'.
He added that the party's Economic Commission would decide on a new target
figure for the minimum wage by the next party conference, but it would be
based on the formula of half median male earnings.
Mr Edmonds also said that Labour must also agree to a precise target for the
achievement of full employment by the time of the next general election. He
added: 'We have to say where the new jobs will come from, how many there
will be and how quickly they will come.'
Support for a more flexible approach to the issue came yesterday from Mr
Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering union, who said:
'There needs to be further discussion before the drawing up of Labour's
election manifesto.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Election spending to be
curbed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Labour is to introduce new rules restricting expenditure by candidates in
future elections for the party leadership, Ivor Owen writes.
This follows the disclosure that Mr Tony Blair spent far more than his two
rivals, Mr John Prescott and Mrs Margaret Beckett, in the contest that
followed the death of John Smith.
Mr Robin Cook confirmed that the party's national executive had agreed in
principle that expenditure curbs and other rules should be in place before
any future contest.
He said Mr Blair had received support from all sections of the party, and
claimed that the outcome would have been the same whatever financial
restrictions had applied.
According to some estimates Mr Blair had a campaign fund of Pounds 88,000 at
his disposal, and spent Pounds 79,000. This compares with the Pounds 17,000
spent by Mrs Beckett and the Pounds 13,000 believed to have been spent by Mr
Prescott.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Shell turns the tide on its sea of paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shell UK will today move to save motorists from drowning under a sea of
paper every time they buy fuel by announcing a scheme to replace trading
stamps and tokens with 'smart cards'.
Shell Smart will be the first nationwide scheme to use such cards. It hopes
to distribute up to 3.5m cards throughout the UK following a limited test in
Scotland. It said it had already received more than 1m applications for the
cards.
Shell Smart is a development of the company's existing reward programme,
where vouchers given with petrol purchases can be redeemed for goods or
services.
Customers will be able to claim a point for every Pounds 6 they spend on
fuel which can be exchanged for gifts, donations to charity and air miles.
A new catalogue offers a wide range of gifts - from a blank cassette tape
costing five points to a video recorder worth 6,085 points.
Shell sees the card as a way to get rid of the expensive and time-consuming
paper-chase necessary to run existing loyalty schemes.
The cards, which contain a microchip, cost Shell about Pounds 1 each, and
the company has installed about 2,000 card readers at a cost of about Pounds
600 each.
Mr Ian Sutcliffe, Shell forecourt marketing manager, said: 'Whilst the
scheme has cost millions of pounds to develop, the cost of handling
electronic transactions is far cheaper than handling paper.'
Mr Gary Anderton of Shell Smart said that once a base of smart cards was
established there would be many possibilities for extending the scheme.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Coalfield boosted by 10-year power deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
National Power, Britain's largest electricity generator, has signed a
10-year contract to buy Welsh coal. It is thought to be the UK's
longest-lasting coal contract.
The move is a fillip for the coal industry as it enters the final stages of
privatisation. The government is expected to decide this month which
companies are to take over British Coal's assets later this year.
The deal increases the hopes of a long-term future for the south Wales
coalfield and the Aberthaw power station that it supplies.
National Power has conditionally agreed to buy 1.5m tonnes of coal a year
from next year from Ryan Group. This compares with the 1m tonnes a year
National Power buys from British Coal from south Wales.
The deal is conditional on Ryan winning its bid for the south Wales coal
region. Although Ryan is one of at least seven companies to have tendered
for south Wales, the deal suggests that National Power would be willing to
sign long-term deals with whichever company is successful, providing the
Ryan price can be matched.
Both National Power and PowerGen have previously indicated that they will
seek relatively short-term contracts when five-year deals negotiated by
British Coal last year expire in 1998.
The circumstances of the Welsh deal are unusual. Aberthaw power station has
been designed to burn - and therefore needs secure supplies of - the
low-volatile coal produced by the Welsh coalfield.
Neither National Power nor Ryan would discuss or confirm the deal yesterday.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Sale of Grid may face big tax setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Regional electricity companies could face a tax bill of more than Pounds 1bn
from their planned flotation of National Grid after a potential setback in
talks with the Inland Revenue.
The tax authority has told them it is unable to comment on a scheme by which
they hope to keep capital gains tax liability to a minimum in demerging the
Grid, which transmits electricity in England and Wales, from their
companies.
Although the regional electricity companies are seeking guidance, executives
fear the Revenue's noncommittal approach means they may have to proceed with
the issue unresolved. At worst it could signal the end of their plans to
minimise capital gains tax.
Pressure is growing on the government to get as much benefit as possible for
taxpayers and consumers from the Grid flotation. It has been criticised for
undervaluing the regional companies when it privatised them four years ago.
The Grid flotation is bound to increase the criticism because the company
was valued at just over Pounds 1bn in 1990, but is now estimated to be worth
at least Pounds 4bn.
Theoretically the government could use its golden share in each regional
company to extract windfall payments after the Grid flotation. Its
free-market principles mean it is highly unlikely to do so. It would prefer
them to cut power bills voluntarily as a means of minimising the political
flak of the Grid flotation. Capital gains tax would provide another way of
doing do.
The Revenue's remarks, in a letter to the companies follow several months of
talks.
Their proposal, through which the Grid would be demerged with an issue of
shares in the transmission company to existing shareholders, is the second
to be presented to the Revenue. The first was rejected outright.
The 'no comment' on the second scheme does not rule out talks, but some
executives fear it may mean that the Revenue will not give any proposal
prior approval. 'We may have to go ahead with a demerger without knowing
whether we will have to pay capital gains tax', said one.
Another interpretation of the letter is that it is a stalling tactic while
the government sorts out the other sensitivities surrounding the flotation.
The regional companies argue that there should be no tax liability because
the shareholders already own the Grid. 'Shareholders will have to pay
capital gains tax when they sell the Grid shares. Levying CGT on the recs at
Grid flotation would mean the tax was being paid twice,' said one executive.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Clarke is warned over investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recovery is unlikely to be sustained unless there is a rise in investment,
especially in small and medium-sized companies, Midlands business leaders
are warning Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
Mr Geoffrey Nicholls, chairman of East Midlands Confederation of British
Industry, said: 'The danger to the recovery is the very slow movement of
investment. Until we see a more improved movement in investment, we cannot
say that the recovery will be solidly based for the long term.'
Birmingham Chamber of Commerce reported in its September survey that fewer
than a quarter of companies were revising upwards their investment plans for
equipment and machinery.
Mr David Botterill, chief executive of West Midlands Engineering Employers
Federation, said: 'A lot of the investment which is taking place is
cost-reducing defensive investment rather than new markets and expansionist
investment.'
Although companies are reporting larger order books, Mr David Probert,
chamber president, noted that demand for manufacturing industries is
export-led where margins and profits are tight.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Free-marketeer enters interventionist ranks: But help does
not mean handouts, Tim Eggar tells David Lascelles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Tim Eggar has become an unlikely flag-waver for the cause of intervention
in business. The trade and industry minister has had his brief at the
department widened recently to include industrial matters. As energy
minister, he made a point of pursuing free-market policies whenever
possible.
Mr Eggar took over the responsibilities of Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry
minister who left in the midsummer reshuffle.
Mr Eggar, formerly identified with the more free-market wing of the Tory
party, is keen to stress the positive role that government can play in
helping business to become more effective in the international marketplace.
He said: 'The government has to play a role if private-sector companies are
going to be able to compete. People who think that the government should
just stand around and let the private sector 'win' are not in the real
world. No other country that we compete with takes that view.'
But Mr Eggar is also careful to define the kind of intervention he has in
mind. There will be 'no state direction or state handouts'.
His aim is to help create an international competitive business environment.
'I see myself working with industrial sectors in partnership.'
He cited as an example last week's council of industry ministers in
Brussels. One of the issues discussed was the biotechnology industry where,
in Mr Eggar's view, EU directives have hindered companies' ability to
compete. 'We have to reduce that.'
Another issue was steel. Mr Eggar was the only minister at the meeting
representing a government without a shareholding in a national steel
company. He said: 'Does that mean we have no interest in steel? Actually,
because we have a successful private-sector steel industry, we need to work
even more to ensure that other countries don't squeeze it.'
Mr Eggar intends to analyse all the main industrial sectors over the next
couple of months to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and then
discuss with them what the government should do.
He added: 'We will work out a joint programme of action that is appropriate.
We are not imposing anything. We want industry to have ownership.'
He has already met representatives from the footwear industry where, he
believes, the government can act as an honest broker to improve links
between equipment suppliers, manufacturers and customers. 'They talk more
bluntly to us than to each other. That means we can play a facilitating
role.'
Because of this, Mr Eggar believes that the sectors that could benefit most
from more contact with government are those which have so far had the least
contact. He cites the process plant industry as an example.
He wants to persuade the European Commission to concentrate more directly on
the competitiveness aspect of its policies and regulations. 'Everything they
do should have a Euro-competitiveness impact statement. We face a very
severe threat to our standard of living.'
One of his particular aims is to advance the liberalisation of the European
energy market where proposals for free trade of electricity and gas across
borders have been stalled for several years.
Although Mr Eggar sees his approach going more deeply into industrial
sectors than before, he stresses that it still conforms to the policy of Mr
Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, of raising competitiveness - as
evidenced by the DTI's white paper on the subject earlier this year.
Mr Charles Wardle, the new junior minister, will handle some energy matters
but Mr Eggar will continue to be responsible for the main policy issues in
the energy sector.
Over the coming months he must settle the sale of British Coal and the
deregulation of the domestic gas market, and decide what to do about the
nuclear power industry. He also has responsibility for the privatisation of
the Post Office.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Chancellor urged to simplify tax regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, one of the profession's
six leading bodies, today urges the chancellor to simplify the tax regime.
'The introduction of self-assessment makes it essential that the system
should be as simple as possible. We urge the government to give urgent
attention to this matter,' it says in its Budget submission.
It also calls for the extension of tax relief on childcare costs to the
self-employed as a temporary measure. This would help parents who are
self-employed or without employer-provided facilities.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland has responded to the
chartered association's proposal for a general accounting council for the UK
and Ireland. 'The formation of another umbrella group for accountancy bodies
is unlikely to be any more effective than those that already exist,' it
said.

FT  03 OCT 94 / KPMG may publish its own results in full
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's second-biggest accountancy partnership said yesterday it would
publish full financial results if its clients backed a plan to incorporate
its audit practice.
KPMG Peat Marwick confirmed that it is to consult clients, investors, and
regulators with a view to creating a limited company to audit its clients
which are public limited companies.
Other options, including the incorporation of the whole business, were
dismissed at a board meeting last week. The firm audits one-fifth of all the
UK's listed companies.
If incorporation goes ahead it would be the first such venture in a leading
accounting firm. Publication of results would also be a first, except for a
brief attempt in 1979 by Arthur Andersen, which was not repeated.
Mr Colin Sharman, KPMG's senior partner, said: 'We intend to reach a final
decision early in 1995.' He added that if incorporation of audit went ahead
KPMG would move to publication of full financial results for its whole
business. Such moves could prompt the most radical restructuring of the
profession since the begining of the last century.
Several other leading accountancy firms are known to be discussing
incorporation. Publication of financial details is likely to bring into the
public arena information on what partners earn, fee structures, and details
on profits.
KPMG has 600 partners and 9,000 staff, and reported a profit of Pounds 498m
last year. The new audit company would have 200 partners and would take a
large share of the Pounds 200m now earned in the audit and accounting
division.
The new audit company would be owned by the partners, including those left
in the original partnership, and would itself be independently audited.
There are no plans for a flotation.
Initial reaction among large corporate clients to the scheme is said to be
positive but KPMG is cautious about the consultation process. 'This is a big
step; we don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot,' Mr Sharman said.
'It is vital that we gain the views of our clients on being serviced by a
limited company, that the regulatory authorities and the investment
community have no fundamental objections, that government bodies will accept
a changed status and, of course, that incorporation is acceptable to our
partnership.'
The driving force behind incorporation is the desire to limit the liability
of partners. Recent corporate collapses have resulted in litigation against
auditors who are seen as having 'the deepest pockets'.
While a new KPMG audit company could still be sued as a corporate entity,
most of the partners would have their own wealth protected. However,
individual partners could still be sued personally. Incorporation also means
that new partners would be protected from becoming liable for outstanding
legal actions.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Welsh Development Agency 'is fighting for its life'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, WALES and WEST CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Welsh Development Agency is fighting for its life, says a report
published today by the Department of City and Regional Planning at the
University of Wales, College of Cardiff.
The report by Professor Kevin Morgan says the Welsh Office is 'seemingly
unsure as to whether it (the agency) ought to have a future at all'.
He states that the Welsh Office, chastened by accusations of failing to
regulate quangos properly, had thrown the agency into disarray by recently
rejecting its corporate plan. The publicly funded agency, the leading quango
in Wales, had been informed 'it should go back to the drawing board to
justify its very existence'.
The report is the first substantial analysis of the agency's role since it
became embroiled in controversy after criticism by the Commons public
accounts committee last year.
The senior management has since been replaced and the agency restructured.
Prof Morgan argues that the new managers, recruited from the private sector,
have been 'novices in the art of political bargaining'. They failed in
consequence to appreciate the significance of the annual corporate plan in
the public expenditure round at a time when the Welsh Office was under
renewed Treasury pressure to look for savings.
'Having remedied its internal governance problems, it (the agency) now finds
itself fighting for its life,' he states. 'While it is perfectly proper for
quangos to justify their existence, to precipitate a crisis in the WDA at
this delicate point in its career raises the question as to whether the
Welsh Office is genuinely interested in having a robust development agency
in Wales.'
Prof Morgan suggests the crisis at the agency stems partly from the fact
that Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, comes from a radically different
Conservative tradition to that of Mr Peter Walker and Mr David Hunt, his
predecessors. Mr Redwood had had an 'unnerving effect on the key Welsh
institutions, including the Welsh Office, by extolling the market and by
being less than effusive about the role of public-sector bodies like the
WDA'.
The report defends the agency for its positive role in modernising the Welsh
economy and enhancing the environment. It 'deserves to have a future.
Indeed, it seems surprising that there should be a question about this when
the English regions are desperately trying to create their own versions of
the WDA.'
Arguing that such institutions need to be effective and accountable, Prof
Morgan says the agency needs to develop better networking skills. He
comments that although the Welsh Office is ideally placed to promote a
networking ethos, and is formally committed to partnerships, it 'seems more
concerned to retain control for itself than to empower the wider network'.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Councils spar with Audit Commission on reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
District councils are in conflict with the Audit Commission over how much
money can be spent in preparation for the local government review.
Labour-controlled Southampton asked if it could appoint managers to plan the
takeover of responsibilities after the Local Government Commission
recommended it for unitary status, which would require it to take control of
education and social services. But the Audit Commission's legal advice was
that the council could only undertake a limited range of activities until
the orders to create a new unitary council had received royal assent.
It said: 'In a case like Southampton or Bristol, the present county council
is responsible for education and social services. It is the county council
which must collect the information about these services that will be
necessary to ensure a smooth transfer of functions.'
The cross-party Association of District Councils pointed out that not all
the councils involved were willing to plan for new unitary councils while
there was still a chance that change could be avoided.
Mr John Truscott, the leader of Southampton city council, said: 'There
doesn't appear to be any logic to it.' He added councils would have to work
to a tight timetable next year, with orders passed by MPs in February at the
earliest, and 'shadow elections' for councillors to supervise creation of
the new councils in May.
Southampton is a member of the English Major Cities group of district
councils which is calling for the government to treat them as a 'special
case'. The group also includes Bristol, Derby, Hull, Leicester, Nottingham,
Plymouth, Portsmouth and Stoke-on-Trent.

FT  03 OCT 94 / OFT rejects City pleas over report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Office of Fair Trading has decided to publish a controversial report on
fixed underwriting commissions which leading City investment banks and
institutional investors have been lobbying to have shelved.
The report, commissioned by the OFT and prepared by Professor Paul Marsh of
the London Business School, concludes that securities firms and fund
managers earn excessive profits on their standing fee for underwriting
equity offerings.
The report concludes that the fixed fee of 2 per cent distributed between
the corporate adviser, broker and institutional investor is too high for the
risks undertaken.
The securities firms and fund managers fear that publication of the report
will reflect badly on the reputation of the City and will be misinterpreted
by those outside the industry.
It is understood that the OFT's inquiry into fixed underwriting commissions
has the backing of the Treasury which has been concerned that the overall
cost of raising capital in London is too high and will erode London's
competitiveness over time.
It is expected that the report will be published later this month or early
next month as one of a series of 'research reports' which the OFT has
prepared. It is believed that it will include a summary from Sir Bryan
Carsberg, director-general of fair trading. However, the report will also
include a summary of the objections which the securities industry has been
raising about its methodology.
The securities industry has argued that in rights offerings, the fixed
commission of 2 per cent reflects the need to guarantee the placement of a
large volume of securities with institutions during a six-week period.
Instead, the varying risks of individual issues are reflected in the
discount to the prevailing market price at which the new securities are
sold. Negotiating fees on each new deal would be a practical impossibility,
it says.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Thailand to get British university
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Work has begun in Thailand on the first British university to be built
outside the UK. It will be staffed by British academics and award degrees
validated by parent universities in the UK.
Ministers hope that the project, led by the Department of Trade and
Industry's education and training group, will be the first of several
British universities throughout the Pacific Rim and the Middle East,
following the model of international American universities.
Baroness Perry, leader of the group which was set up a year ago to boost UK
educational exports, said the project was needed to co-ordinate exports by
British universities and to reverse inroads made in the market by
higher-education institutions from Germany, the US and Australia.
Funding for the university is coming exclusively from Thai financiers. It
will be a private institution, with local people paying for tuition.
Lady Perry said: 'A British degree has international currency, and Thai
people will be more than willing to pay for it.'
The university aims to accept its first students in October 1996 and will
eventually cater for about 10,000 students. Two campus sites have been
designated, one of which will specialise in finance and economics, while the
other will concentrate on engineering and technology.
The project hopes to win final approval from the Thai government in July,
once detailed arrangements on appointments of administrators and lecturers
have been finalised.
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, said there was scope for similar
initiatives elsewhere in the Pacific Rim, as several nations, including
Korea and Taiwan, have a shortage of university places compared with the
numbers that graduate from secondary school.
Several British universities are already active in the area although the
Thai project is the most ambitious. For example Warwick University, which is
not taking part in the new project, has separate manufacturing departments
in Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur and plans to offer accounting and finance
courses from Shanghai.
The DTI group also aims to expand British higher education in Latin America,
where it has so far made few inroads.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Double blow for postal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Government plans to privatise the Post Office have received a double blow
from Ulster Unionist MPs and Conservative constituency associations.
With the cabinet set to decide soon whether to proceed with the sale of 51
per cent of Royal Mail, the nine Ulster Unionist MPs at Westminster have
sent a formal submission to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, saying they oppose the move.
Meanwhile, a poll of the people who chair Conservative constituency
associations has indicated that even these party ultra-loyalists favour
keeping the Post Office in the public sector - but with greater commercial
freedom.
The government's proposals have met with a succession of critical responses
in recent weeks, culminating on Friday when they were roundly condemned by
the industry's leading user group.
Leading supporters of privatisation within the cabinet such as Mr Heseltine
and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, have recently appeared confident that
formal approval for the sell-off would be granted. But Mr John Major has not
yet made up his mind. The prime minister is wary about the potential
political cost of a decision which Labour says will signal a significant
rundown in rural post services and the closure of many village Post Offices.
Unionist opposition would significantly increase the risk of embarrassing
Commons defeats for the government.
Dissident Tory backbenchers have been calling for a minority sale of Royal
Mail, with the government retaining 51 per cent of the shares.
Mr John Taylor, Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, said that Unionists did
not 'like the idea of the Royal Mail ceasing to operate' in Ulster. 'I have
had more letters on this subject in the last four weeks than on any subject
for the last 10 years,' he said.
The MORI survey of more than 100 of the people who chair Tory constituency
associations was commissioned by Post Office unions. It found that 57 per
cent of those questioned favoured keeping all the Post Office in the public
sector.
Mr Heseltine's favoured option is to privatise Royal Mail and Parcelforce
while hiving off the Post Office's Counters division, which is responsible
for high-street and village Post Offices, into a separate organisation in
the public sector.

The government's Pounds 1.25bn apprenticeship programme, which aims to train
thousands of young people every year, has made a patchy start, a report from
the Institute of Personnel and Development says. Many of the Training and
Enterprise Councils which will run the scheme are behind schedule, often
because they are still looking for businesses to take on apprentices.
Some Tecs in London have secured barely half the places they need for the
programme which is designed for people aged 16 and 17 wanting to learn
vocational skills in the workplace rather than school.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, told the Bar conference in London
over the weekend that more judges were urgently needed in the Appeal Court
to tackle the 'serious ills of expense and delay' which dog the civil
justice system.
England's most senior civil court judge said six more appeal court judges
were needed immediately 'otherwise delays (in hearing civil appeals) will
become quite unacceptable'.
Mr Robert Seabrook QC, chairman of the Bar, attacked the government for
delay in setting up the new independent review body on miscarriages of
justice recommended by last year's Royal Commission on Criminal Justice.

The cost of the allowance announced by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in

it should 'help tens of thousands of mothers to get back into work and off

FT  03 OCT 94 / Warning on cost of housing benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cost of housing benefit is out of control and growing at an alarming
rate, a research paper published today by the Social Market Foundation
argues, James Blitz writes.
Amid signs that Mr Jonathan Aitken, chief secretary to the Treasury, is
pressing for a crackdown on housing benefit in the public-spending round,
the paper by Mr Greg Clark, a business economist from the Open University,
says the programme is in urgent need of reform.
Mr Clark argues that the system gives tenants no incentive to bargain with
landlords over rent levels.
He says the housing benefit programme has grown about 140 per cent since
1988 to Pounds 9bn per year, more than child benefit and unemployment
benefit combined. He calls for the introduction of a direct cash allowance
to claimants to encourage them to negotiate lower rents.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Investors are told to check advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors seeking independent financial advice should check that their
adviser is still authorised, the new financial services industry regulator
warned yesterday.
At least 13 groups have had their authorisation revoked for failing to meet
the midnight Friday deadline for applications to join the Personal
Investment Authority, which is replacing Fimbra as the main regulator for
independent financial advisers.
Advisers who did not want to join the PIA had to give notice before the
deadline that they were planning to leave the business, become tied agents,
join a network or apply to another regulator. They could then keep their
authorisation until the end of the year or until accepted or rejected by
another regulator.
Those which took no action by the deadline automatically lost their
authorisation with immediate effect. It is a criminal offence for
unauthorised advisers to conduct investment business, and their customers
are not covered by compensation schemes.
The Securities and Investments Board has not been able to confirm whether
125 groups which said they would apply to other regulators had actually done
so by the deadline. If not, their authorisation will also be revoked
immediately.
Fimbra used to regulate about 5,300 independent financial advisers. Although
final numbers are not yet known, it appears that the PIA has received at
least 4,900 applications, but more than 400 of them were from firms
previously regulated by other bodies. About 2,000 applications have already
been approved.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Hospital offers land in return for services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A leading London hospital plans to give away land and buildings on its
prestigious Chelsea site to private bidders willing to develop and run
hospital services.
The proposal, by the Royal Brompton National Heart &amp; Lung Hospital Trust, is
one of the most novel responses to government calls for more private finance
in the National Health Service.
Private consortia have been invited to finance and build a Pounds 20m second
phase of the hospital's redevelopment programme, housing outpatients'
clinics and research departments. An unusual feature of the proposal is a
requirement that the development consortium will also have to run a range of
the hospital's support services - including catering, domestic and off-site
laboratories - for seven years, and manage its 28-bed private-patient unit.
The idea generated bids from 14 private-sector consortia. These have been
reduced to four, and the hospital's board is due to select a partner with
which it will enter detailed negotiations on October 11.
Formal government approval will then be required but ministers are already
aware of the plan. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said in June
that involving the private sector offered the NHS real advantages and could
improve services for patients. Some potential private-sector partners,
however, accuse senior NHS managers and officials of showing unnecessary
caution towards joint ventures, and the Royal Brompton proposal is regarded
as an important test of the health department's willingness to endorse
imaginative schemes.
The successful bidder's payment will be the opportunity to redevelop a
redundant clinical building and nurses home - located in one of the
capital's most sought-after residential areas - and part of the hospital's
phase-two site bordering King's Road, Chelsea. Construction groups
submitting bids include George Wimpey, Tarmac and Sir Robert McAlpine. The
plan to transfer the support services - which cost around Pounds 5m a year -
to the private sector as part of the deal has brought construction groups
and property developers into partnership with contract-service
organisations.
Mr Bill Bain, Royal Brompton chief executive, said: 'We aim to achieve the
expansion of the hospital at no cost to the taxpayer, hopefully doing so in
a way which will improve overall efficiency and enable us to lower our
prices in the NHS internal market.'
The hospital has engaged Newchurch, venture management consultants, and
Hambros Bank to help develop its plans. Mr Bain acknowledged that critics
might fear the Royal Brompton risked disposing of valuable sites too
cheaply. But he added: 'We are not commercially naive. The hospital
management is taking top quality advice.'

FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Infrastructure attracts more
private finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Private financiers are moving into infrastructure development, in volumes
well above expectations of just a few years ago, despite the risks of
investing in emerging economies. This is according to a report released by
the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector arm.
The IFC is playing a leading role in managing private sector infrastructure
development. Since its first infrastructure financing in 1966, the
corporation has undertaken 88 infrastructure transactions worth Dollars 15bn
(Pounds 9.5bn) in 20 countries.
The 'renaissance' in private sector financing can be traced to several
developments. In many countries, both the governments and consumers are
disappointed by the poor performance of public projects. Other governments,
with tight budgets, are turning to their private sectors.
Developments in financial markets have created a wider pool of financiers
and more financing techniques. Technological changes in telecommunications,
power and transport systems have reduced unit costs and eased private sector
entry.
In 1988-1992, governments in 15 developing countries privatised more than
Dollars 20bn of infrastructure-related assets.
'Companies have supplied finance, and the ability to take risks and to
implement projects efficiently, while governments have contributed a
willingness to privatise, to experiment with new more competitive regulatory
environments, and to encourage non-guaranteed financing,' the report says.
The rise in private financing and management of power plants, roads and
other infrastructure can ultimately deliver better results than projects
managed by governments, the report said, noting that, while it is still too
early to judge operational performance, signed contracts suggest that
efficiency gains are being achieved.
The IFC says companies are also learning to manage environmental risks.
Project managers are bringing in foreign companies to apply the lessons of
environmental management learned in their own countries. 'Private ownership
that encourages better cost recovery is also having an impact on energy
conservation by customers,' it said.

   By PETER NORMAN

<TEXT>
Russia surprised and shocked the G7 countries at the weekend by appearing to
demand sweeping readjustment of its foreign debt position. Officials said Mr
Alexander Shokhin, Russian deputy prime minister, asked for treatment of
Russia's debt that would be equivalent to the 1950s London agreement
settling Germany's debt burdens after the second world war.
Although details were not clear, Mr Shokhin reportedly sought an answer
within seven days. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor, said afterwards the G7
had not been able to make a considered response to the Russian demands.
Instead, G7 finance ministers had asked Mr Shokhin to put his proposals on
paper. Resolving Russia's debt problems would need much more detailed work
by the Paris Club of western creditor nations, he said.

FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Ministers to probe savings and
investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Finance ministries of the world's big industrial countries decided yesterday
to investigate the outlook for world savings and investment, in the hope
that this might shed light on current, high, real long-term interest rates.
The Group of Ten countries adopted a proposal by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK
chancellor, to launch such a study. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister,
said that the European Union's council of economics and finance ministers
(Ecofin) would also investigate how different tax regimes affected savings
and capital investment in the course of Germany's current six-month
presidency of the EU.
The linked questions of high long-term interest rates and savings and
investment were raised in Saturday's meeting of finance ministers and
central bank governors from the Group of Seven countries (the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada). The debate was taken further in
a meeting yesterday of the G10 (the G7 plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden
and Switzerland and so 11 countries in fact) and the policy-making interim
committee of the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Clarke told the committee that savings and investments were running
perhaps two to four percentage points lower than in the 1960s and early
1970s, when they both accounted for about a quarter of world gross domestic
product. Also, real interest rates were at historically high levels, up by
one to two percentage points against the average for most of the period
since 1945.
The chancellor said the industrialised countries needed a consensus on what
to do, because very large new investment opportunities, in prospect in Asia
and Latin America, would increase claims on savings. More such claims might
soon emerge in former communist countries and South Africa.
Mr Clarke said steps must be taken to reduce the financial demands of
governments on markets by reducing fiscal deficits.
This theme was taken up vigorously by Mr Waigel. The German minister pointed
out that total government debt, in the industrialised countries of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), now averaged
70 per cent of GDP and was 25 percentage points higher than at the start of
the 1980s.
Mr Waigel said a determined medium-term consolidation of industrial country
budgets was the 'central pre-requisite' for reducing global imbalances
between savings and investment and hence reducing high real interest rates.
He said Germany was showing the way and would probably bring its annual
deficit/GDP ratio below 3 per cent this year and thus sooner than expected.
Yesterday, Mr Clarke underlined that free international capital flows and
the global capital market were a boon to the world economy. He rejected the
idea of re-imposing capital controls or re-creating formal exchange rate
links between leading currencies.
UK officials said the G10 study would be taken forward by the ministers'
deputies and would also involve the IMF and the Basle-based Bank for
International Settlements. They hoped for an interim report by the IMF
meeting in Washington next spring.
At the G7 meeting on Saturday, ministers decided to involve the central bank
governors more closely in their discussions, so as to increase the
governors' understanding of the impact of financial markets on their
economies.
Commenting on long-term interest rates after the G7 meeting, Mr Eddie
George, Bank of England governor, said he and many of his colleagues thought
that bond markets were exaggerating the dangers of inflation.

FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF/World Bank in Madrid: Latin America 'in need of
institutional reform'
</HEADLINE>

Reform of financial institutions, and encouragement of private savings in
Latin American countries, is needed to reduce the volatility of capital
flows into and out of the region, a group of leading bankers said yesterday.
The Group of 30, a Wash-ington-based group of executive of banks and
investment banks, said that capital flows into Latin American countries were
more volatile than those related to the bank loans they had largely
replaced.
The group said the rise in US short-term interest rates this year had sown
this volatility in debt instruments with Dollars 10.5bn (Pounds 6.6bn) in
new bond issues during the first nine months of this year, compared with
Dollars 2.3bn in 1993.
The study also found that foreign portfolio investment in Latin America has
substituted for domestic savings.
The group recommended these reforms in Latin America, to reduce the degree
of substitution, making local capital markets more liquid and better able to
withstand fluctuations in external flows:
Central banks should be independent and should pursue domestic price
stability. The study says such stability - towards which considerable
progress has been made - underpins the growth of mature local capital
markets.
There should be reform in the financial sector, including higher accounting
and disclosure standards. Countries should try to develop pension, insurance
and mutual funds, and develop longer-maturity bonds and derivatives. The
study called for Latin American banks' capital requirements to be higher
than the minimum laid down in the 1988 Basle accord, because of the
relatively high risk of their loan portfolios.
Domestic loans and investment rates should be raised from current low
levels. Private sector incentives such as changes in taxation and
requirements to invest in pension funds should be considered.
Industrial countries should continue to support economic reform by ensuring
access to their markets by Latin American goods and services, and by
ratifying the Uruguay round of global trade liberalisation.

US Marines will begin withdrawing from Haiti today, to be replaced by extra
US military police who are to help disarm forces loyal to Haiti's military
rulers, Defence Department officials said last night, report Canute James,
in Kingston, and agencies.
US troops are being ordered to stop violence between Haitians when they
safely can, but a senior US official said yesterday that this did not
indicate a broadening of US policy.
Also today, about 300 soldiers from seven Caribbean countries will be
deployed in Haiti - the first non-US troops to arrive since the military
intervention began a fortnight ago.
The new Caribbean troops, part of a multinational force which is to assist
imposing order in Haiti, have been training in Puerto Rico for three weeks.
They will be assigned to the docks in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital,
relieving US personnel.
The port area has been the scene of bloody clashes between factions
supporting the Haitian military and those backing the exiled President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Comeback kid shows no fight: Jurek Martin examines a
battered President Bill Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Franklin Roosevelt created it, Ronald Reagan perfected it and it is now on
every US president's Saturday morning schedule.
It is a short radio report to the nation, from the White House or wherever
the president is, lasting no more than about five minutes. An hour later, a
representative of the opposition party of the day gets equal time to
respond.
There was more reason than usual to tune in to President Bill Clinton's talk
last Saturday. Last week, the Republican party's 'scorched earth' policy
eviscerated in Congress what had remained of his domestic legislative
agenda.
On Friday afternoon, campaign finance reform had gone the way of healthcare
reform. Approval of the Gatt trade treaty was put on hold - by a Democrat at
that, Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina. Bills covering cleansing of
contamination by toxic waste, western land preservation, housing, and
telecommunications were all dead or dying.
Even popular proposals, such as reform of lobbying and education, needed
respirators.
As the week ended, Democrats, like Senator George Mitchell, the majority
leader in the Senate, were openly apoplectic about Republican
obstructionism. The opposition, the senator charged, was determined to bring
Congress further into disrepute 'so they can inherit the rubble'.
Yet, on Saturday morning, the Democratic president did not even allow the
word 'Republican' to pass his lips. He did try to parade his achievements,
and bemoaned what had been lost, but the culprits were always unnamed
'lobbyists' or Senate 'filibusters', which, as every Congress-watcher knows
full well, have virtually all been orchestrated by the Republican party.
Almost as an indication of Republican contempt for the president, the
party's response, by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, hardly referred to
Mr Clinton's remarks. Instead, it assaulted his policies on Haiti, which the
president had not even mentioned.
Mr Clinton's reluctance to come out fighting may reflect immediate political
concerns, not least the fate this week of the bills to reform lobbying and
education. However, by that token, he might even be persuaded to hold back
until the Senate has reconvened at the end of November to consider the Gatt
agreement - and that will not be until after the mid-term congressional
elections on November 8.
Survey after survey of US opinion shows the elections as likely to be
potentially disastrous for Mr Clinton and the Democrats, who now represent
the political establishment in the widely loathed capital.
Both the New York Times and the Washington Post yesterday carried extensive
analyses, pointing to the likelihood of Republican control of the Senate,
possibly of the House of Representatives and even of most state
governorships.
Some Democrats in rock-solid seats are now fighting for their lives,
including Senator Edward Kennedy in Massachusetts. Many have chosen to
respond by shifting themselves to the maximum distance from their president.
A mid-western fundraising trip by Mr Clinton a week ago was poorly attended
and its financial gain was disappointing.
In fairness, the electoral season will not really begin until Congress
adjourns, probably at the end of this week. Incumbents have been kept in
Washington by the heavy congressional schedule, though some, like Mr Tom
Foley, Speaker of the House, were forced back home at the weekend by polls
indicating the depth of their difficulties.
But, even if the public perception is that Mr Clinton is a drag on
Democratic candidates, a deferential silence from him in the five weeks
before November 8 might be yet more devastating. It would risk leaving the
impression that he is prepared to face two more years of Washington
'gridlock', which is the certain result of large Republican gains.
As R W Apple noted in the New York Times yesterday, this impasse with
Capitol Hill could be turned to the president's advantage in 1996, as it was
did in 1948 when President Harry Truman ran for re-election in the last
months of the 'do nothing' Republican Congress returned two years before.
But a more common view among Democrats, especially those up for re-election
now, is that it would be folly to let the Republicans 'get away with it'
now.
Mr Clinton, self-styled 'comeback kid' of the 1992 race, can still be a
formidable campaigner when his heart is in it. But, on Saturday, in front of
a clear target and a ready-made forum, there was no hint of fighting spirit.
His wife, Hillary, who also has much to lament with the loss of healthcare
reform, was at least back in political harness campaigning for her brother,
Hugh Rodham, a Senate candidate in Florida. But the nation still waits on
its president.

being elected - Latin America

The presidential election today in Brazil and the likely victory of Mr
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, a sociology professor turned inflation-conquering
finance minister, are prompting optimism throughout Latin America about
prospects for growth, if the region's biggest economy remains stable.
But for thousands of Brazilian twins, the issue is more straightforward:
will they get the vote? The twins were disenfranchised when election
authorities, noting that such details as dates of birth and parents' names
were identical, suspected they were fraudulent attempts to create votes for
'non-existent' people, a common practice in parts of Brazil.
Last-minute appeals by desperate siblings appear to have persuaded the
authorities to let the twins vote. But as SBT, Brazil's second TV station,
reported on Saturday night, the change of policy has not yet been officially
sent to the provinces.
Boris Kasoy, the station's anchor, whose catch phrase 'it's a disgrace' is
used nightly to criticise the government, described the episode as plain
'stupid'.
Despite such late hitches, campaigning has been peaceful and debate, at
times, serious. The main newspapers agreed that Brazil's democracy has
matured since the vicious 1989 presidential campaign won by Mr Fernando
Collor, who later resigned amid corruption charges.
'In 1989 polarisation, radicalism and passions predominated. In 1994 we have
reached polling day with less turbulence,' according to an editorial in
Folha de Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest selling daily.
The media, which have supported Mr Cardoso throughout the campaign, also
agreed that his expected victory showed the country wanted stability rather
than change. As finance minister, he planned the country's new currency, the
Real, which led to a fall in monthly inflation from 50 per cent to less than
2 per cent.
Voters seem attracted by that record of success rather than by the rhetoric
of Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the left winger who promised to tackle
social problems and build a 'fairer' Brazil.
Ms Maria Tereza Souza Monteiro, a polling specialist interviewed by Veja
news magazine, said: 'The majority voting for (Mr Cardoso) are acting out of
caution to prevent things changing unpredictably. What has struck me is that
the elector, trying to be more rational, has this time refused to dream,
which was always an inseparable part of our election campaigns.'
Mr Cardoso is well known throughout Latin America, where his work as a
left-of-centre sociologist is still studied.
His victory will be welcomed by the continent because he is likely to
accelerate Brazil's integration with its neighbours. For example, he is
strongly committed to Mercosur, the customs union with Argentina, Paraguay
and Uruguay, which comes into force on January 1.
The weekend press in Buenos Aires was unanimous in its assessment that the
inflation-battling Plan Real had wooed the Brazilian people and was certain
to catapult Mr Cardoso to power. Newspapers pointed out the added importance
of Brazilian elections for Argentina, given the close economic ties being
forged between the two countries within the customs union.
In a piece entitled 'Brazilian elections: An event viewed through a
magnifying glass in Argentina', La Nacion said it was now commonly held that
'with Mercosur, everything that occurs in one country has infinite
importance in the other.'
It was also genuinely accepted, said La Nacion, that Argentina was rooting
for a Cardoso victory so that Brazil could be 'once and for all converted to
a market economy'.
Mr Cardoso, it said, had borrowed heavily from Argentina's inflation policy
under economy minister Domingo Cavallo. 'Here, they joke that the Plan Real
is the Plan Cavallo written in Portuguese (Brazil's language).' The tabloid
Clarn warned that winning the elections was the easy part. Mr Cardoso had to
push crucial budgetary reforms through congress, it said, or 'Brazil would
once again become ungovernable'.
In a separate article, Clarn contrasted the personalities of the
presidential frontrunners as a symbol of Brazil's yawning social division.
As a child, the academic Cardoso 'adored the classics' and studied with a
private tutor, while factory worker Lula 'ate bread for the first time when
he was seven'.
Left-wing Pagina 12 ran a similar piece contrasting the lives of the bronzed
Ipanema beach set with life in a Rio slum, Rocinha. It found much support
for the Plan Real in both. 'The inhabitants of the biggest shanty town in
Latin America were also seduced by the new money.' In this, it said, lay the
secret of Mr Cardoso's likely success.
In Chile, where Mr Cardoso lived for a spell during Brazil's 1964-1985
period of military rule, El Mercurio, the country's leading daily, reported
Mr Cardoso's increasing lead in opinion polls while the main TV channels
concentrated on the pre-election atmosphere.
La Epoca newspaper went into greater detail and pointed out that the two
main candidates, Mr Cardoso and Mr da Silva, had the backing of organised
political parties. As such, they differed from 'outsider' politicians such
as Mr Alberto Fujimori, who was elected president of Peru in 1990, or
Brazil's Mr Collor, who won the presidency in the previous year without the
help of the main political parties.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Cuba opens new markets for sales by farmers
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HAVANA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'Pardon our inexperience. Tomorrow, we will do it better'. The sign in one
Havana marketplace summed up the first day of Cuba's latest economic reform
experiment.
Nearly 150 farm markets, a novelty in the state-controlled economy, opened
their doors in the Caribbean island at the weekend as state farms and
co-operatives, including military units, began to sell surplus meat, fruit
and vegetables directly to the public.
But small peasant farmers were conspicuous by their absence, a sign that
they may be initially wary about whether the move will really benefit them.
Shoppers gathered early at the 15 markets opened in Havana, but the
avalanche of demand predicted by many observers did not immediately
materialise.
Farms operated by the armed forces appeared to be setting the pace at the
new markets, in terms of both prices and produce offered. Cuba's armed
forces, battle-hardened in overseas wars in Angola and Ethiopia, are now
being increasingly used to combat the island's internal economic crisis.
They have been helping to grow food for the population since last year.
Mr Manuel Vila Sosa, internal trade minister, had promised that the farm
markets would operate on a free market basis. Producers, after fulfilling
contracted quotas to supply the state, could set their own prices for the
general public, reflecting supply and demand. Sales income would be taxed.
Undercutting and eliminating the black market in Cuba is a main objective of
the new farm markets. Food shortages are one of the most sensitive symptoms
of the four-year economic recession gripping the country.
The crisis followed the collapse of Cuba's preferential trade ties with what
used to be the Soviet bloc, an economic belly-blow worsened by the recent
tightening by the US of its trade embargo on Cuba.
The government, which for years has paid rock-bottom prices to farmers, is
hoping the price incentives offered by the new markets will help to reverse
the current fall in food production.

FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Sectors where the market agreements came -
The US-Japan pacts reached at the weekend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan struck a series of market-opening trade agreements at the
weekend, averting a threatened trade war between the world's two largest
economies.
The US administration, which had been pressing Japan to open key markets,
hailed the accords - covering telecommunications, medical equipment,
insurance and glass - as landmark deals to result in billions of dollars of
new sales of US goods and services. Agreement was reached in the following
sectors:
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT
For the Dollars 2.5bn-a-year medical equipment government procurement
market, the pact provides for the use of open and transparent procedures and
decisions based on 'overall greatest value' of bids. This means highly
sophisticated medical technology made by foreign companies will not be
automatically excluded because of their initial price.
Japanese hospitals will have to publish annual information on the top 10
medical technology products it plans to buy that year. The pact also has a
comprehensive complaint mechanism for dealing with 'unfair' bids.
INSURANCE
Japan promises more transparency in its regulatory system, import procedural
protection, specific liberalisation measures and a stronger anti-trust
policy. It also agreed to introduce the broker system to diversify and
promote competition.
Japan has the world's second largest insurance market, with approximately
Dollars 320bn in premium income annually; foreign companies take only a 3
per cent share of this. The government agreed to implement a three-stage
deregulation plan to expand sales opportunities for foreign companies.
FLAT GLASS
A Dollars 4.5bn-a-year market, dominated by three big producers with
separate, tightly controlled distribution arrangements. Japan's glass window
market is the second largest in the world, and the US has less than 1 per
cent of it - compared with global shares exceeding 25 per cent in Europe and
Latin America. US and Japan have agreed to 'a set of principles' and will
seek to flesh out the agreement in the next 30 days. Failing that, the US
will then bring a unilateral trade action against Japan's flat glass market.
VEHICLES AND PARTS
The US sets aside many of its demands and brings a unilateral trade action
against the regulatory regime for car replacement parts. This will become
lucrative as foreign sales gain market share in Japan. The licensing process
blocking imports is 'so obvious and pernicious that it cries out for
relief', Mr Kantor said.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
Two pacts were agreed. One covers the sale of telecommunications products
and services to Japanese government agencies (a Dollars 2bn-a-year market)
and the other, sales to Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, (65 per cent
government-owned), a market of Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.6bn) a year.
The pacts are similar. Japan agrees to provide early, detailed information
of procurements; to allow foreign suppliers input on purchase plans before
tenders are finalised; to use international standards when available; to
reduce the number of sole-source contracts, which tend to go only to
Japanese companies; and to institute a modern 'overall best-value' bid
evaluation system.
The US promises its own industries to closely monitor the NTT pact and
consult with Japan, as needed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's business community had resigned itself to some market opening
agreement before the partial accord covering US-Japanese trade issues was
announced, Michiyo Nakamoto writes from Tokyo. Even the car industry, which
could be adversely affected by the US decision to initiate a Section 301
investigation of the replacement parts industry, took the latest US verdict
in its stride.
'Once the business environment improves it will be possible to prove that
the Japanese market is not closed,' one industry official commented.
In the glass industry there was relief that the talks did not result in
sanctions, as well as a sense that their claims about the openness of the
market had been vindicated. 'The flat glass market in Japan is by no means
closed and we will aim to meet our users' satisfaction in line with the
anti-monopoly law,' Mr Kazuo Shinya, vice-president of Asahi Glass, said.
The main concern for Japanese business has not been so much the impact of
likely sanctions, which has never been considered significant, as the
adverse effect another rupture with the US could have on currency rates.

After a 20-hour negotiating marathon, US trade officials were too weary to
celebrate their success in reaching 'significant trade agreements' with
Japan in the areas of telecommunications, medical technology, insurance and
flat glass.
'You wouldn't want me to fall under the table right before your eyes,' said
a hoarse Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, as he prepared to go
home.
But first he read from a dog-eared sheet of paper his 'instructions' from
his deputy, Ms Charlene Barshefsky: 'Three things we are going to get:
Annual progress in (exports) value and (market) share. Significant increase
in access and sales, using recent trends to evaluate the extent of the
process made.'
This was the formula agreed for the results-oriented trade pacts the US has
been demanding for the past 15 months. For months Japanese officials called
it 'managed trade' and skilfully organised worldwide sentiment against it.
The Europeans, whom Mr Kantor had hoped to count as allies, stood aside. In
the end, the deals contained no 'numerical targets' or fixed market shares.
In fact, Ms Barshefsky said, US government and industry wanted no more than
rising 'trend lines'. They did not want specific targets setting ceilings on
foreign market share as in the case of semiconductors.
The successful Japanese public relations offensive emboldened the
bureaucracy and delayed agreement, said one former US official. But fears of
unrest on the currency markets, the return to power of old-line Japanese
officials and concern about damage to the overall US-Japan alliance
ultimately prevailed.
The US got by no means everything it wanted, but the gains were solid enough
to cede to Japan a victory of sorts on vehicles. Efforts to get commitments
from Japan's private sector for increased purchases of car parts were set
aside. Mr Kantor, however, will bring a trade action against Japan's
regulatory barriers to sales of foreign car replacement parts.
The action will come under Section 301 of US trade law, rather than the
much-loathed 'Super 301', which 'may have been the wrong signal at the wrong
time', said Mr Kantor. There is little difference between the provisions -
both require a year of negotiations to end specified trade barriers, with
the threat of threaten sanctions if all else fails  - but a simple 301 is
considered less offensive.
According to US officials, the final throes of the talks were gruelling,
repetitious and marked by some embarrassing incidents of recriminations by a
senior Japanese official towards his juniors. Although it was held in
Washington, the dozen US negotiators involved were greatly outnumbered by
the Japanese delegation. Eighty were lodged at the Willard hotel alone.
The achievement should go a long way towards boosting Mr Kantor, who has
lately has been criticised for moving too slowly to get the Uruguay Round
pact through Congress.
'Kantor has proven once again to be the guy who gets results,' said Mr Clyde
Prestowitz, one of the administration's outside advisers on Japan. 'I don't
know how much this will effect the trade deficit but it will make a
significant difference for companies in these sectors.'
Mr Kantor sought to gain some credit for President Bill Clinton, who he said
had been 'clear, precise and unwavering' in his instructions. Then he talked
of the 'enormous common agenda' shared by the US and Japan - implementation
of the Uruguay Round, moving the Asian Pacific regional trade group toward
more open trade, political and strategic issues.
'It involves co-operating together to create global growth to raise
standards of living, not only in our own countries but around the world.'
This package of five trade deals takes both countries 'a giant step' toward
those goals, he said.

<TEXT>
The failure to reach an accord on further opening Japanese markets to US
vehicles and parts soured what was otherwise a highly positive response by
US companies to the outcome of the talks, Richard Waters writes from New
York.
Ford, the US's second-biggest motor manufacturer, said that failure in such
a significant area of trade 'raises questions about Japan's seriousness' in
opening its markets. It added that it would press the administration to
monitor how Japanese companies operate in future in both the Japanese and US
car markets, and called for a presidential commission to 'recommend further
action'. Like other US manufacturers, Ford claims that some structural
aspects of the Japanese car market act as hidden barriers to importers.
For instance, the fact that Japanese manufacturers have financial stakes in
many dealers makes it difficult for foreign manufacturers to find dealers to
take on their products, Ford said.
Mr Andrew Card, American Automobile Manufacturers Association president,
added: 'No agreement with Japan can be meaningful without addressing the
auto and auto parts sector.'

Japan and the European Commission have revised upwards their forecasts for
exports of Japanese cars to the EU by 9,000 cars, a rise of 1.3 per cent
against the 1993 agreement.
The increase formed part of an agreement in July 1991 allowing for a
transitional period during which time Japan will monitor exports to the EU
and the five member states that previously restricted imports. It reflects
the unexpectedly higher number of vehicle registrations this year. The
Commission and the Japanese government now predict that demand this year
will increase this year by 4.4 per cent. The forecast of exports to the five
member states that previously restricted imports are France, 78,500; Italy,
47,000; Portugal 39,500; Spain, 35,500; UK 184,600.

<TEXT>
European Commission officials last night predicted that the EU would be able
to ratify the Uruguay Round accord before the end of the year, ahead of the
official deadline. The news will be welcomed by governments worried that the
EU would not meet its side of the billion-dollar trade agreement on time. It
will also send a positive signal to the US, whose own ratification
procedures are hampered by uncertainty.
An announcement by the European Court of Justice that it would give its
opinion on who has the power to negotiate in certain trade areas on November
15 ended a dispute between the Council of Ministers and the Commission over
the legal basis for ratification. Officials, who were not expecting the
judgment so early, said this allowed enough time to ratify before January 1.
It has also emerged that the Council of Ministers has agreed to send the
necessary paperwork to the European parliament to allow it to be consulted
ahead of the deadline. 'Both reasons make it all the more likely that we
will come out in time,' said the Commission.
The Commission asked the court for advice after member states argued that it
did not have the authority to negotiate in areas such as services and
intellectual property rights where no trans-EU legislation exists. Fears
that the court would not produce a verdict early enough to meet the deadline
prompted the German presidency of the EU to work out a code of conduct under
which the Commission would for most purposes be able to conduct trade
negotiations, leaving member states to have their say in a few special
circumstances.

FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: US and UK show best drugs markets growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK and US have consolidated their positions as the fastest-growing
pharmaceuticals markets among large developed countries during the first
seven months of 1994,according to figures published today by IMS
International, the specialist market research company.
The huge north American market grew by 7 per cent to Dollars 29.9bn in
prescription drug sales compared with the first seven months of 1993. This
compares with average growth of 5 per cent for the whole of last year,
suggesting that efforts by insurers and employers to cut their healthcare
bills were having little effect on the drugs side.
The second biggest market is Japan, which imposed widespread price cuts in
April this year. Sales to July grew just 1 per cent to Dollars 12.2bn in
constant currency terms, compared with an average 6 per cent growth during
1993.
In the UK, one of the smaller markets, sales grew 8 per cent to Dollars
3.1bn, a small fall from 1993's average of 11 per cent, possibly as a result
of price cuts imposed by the government at the end of last year.
France, which has for many years had low drug prices but high per capita
consumption, saw an above-average rise in sales in July. Sales for the first
seven months grew 1 per cent to Dollars 6bn, compared with zero growth in
the six months to June. This was nevertheless a sharp fall on 1993's average
of 6 per cent growth, reflecting France's determination to maintain low
prices in the face of its high consumption rates.
Italy, which reformed its health policies at the start of the year, is now
the only country in the top eight not to show at some growth, the IMS report
said. Italy's drugs bill fell 2 per cent in 1993 and 7 per cent in the seven
months to July. The increased decline was the result of government reforms
in January this year which cut subsidies on many drugs.
Germany's drugs budget reforms were enacted in 1993, leading to a fall of 9
per cent in spending in that year. The first seven months of 1994 showed a 6
per cent rise, perhaps because doctors and patients were learning to exploit
the loophole that hospital drugs were exempt from last year's controls.
By therapeutic area, central nervous system drugs, including
anti-depressants, extended their lead as the most popular category in the
US. This may be because of continuing publicity surrounding Eli Lilly's
best-selling drug, the anti-depressant Prozac, which has been more popular
than expected this year.

<TEXT>
Malaysia, China, Korea, Singapore and Thailand are asking lawyers to look
into a decision by the European Commission to impose duties on televisions
sold in the European market, writes Emma Tucker in Brussels
The decision was announced at the weekend after a year-long investigation
into allegations that these countries were 'dumping' their goods in Europe,
or selling them at prices below those in their home markets. The commission
argues there will be no 'dramatic' increase in prices from the duties, which
range from as little as 3.1 per cent to 29.8 per cent. The investigation was
triggered by complaints from six European producers: Thomson of France,
Dutch electronics group Philips, Grundig, and Nokia of Germany, Bang &amp;
Olufsen of Denmark, and Italy's Seleco.
Its findings showed the market share of the five countries under
investigation had increased from 9.9 per cent in 1989 to 19.6 per cent in
1992. Over the same period, in spite of the fact that the market was
growing, the EU industry's share had dropped from 36 to 28 per cent.

FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Gatt ruling on vehicle taxes goes against
EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A dispute settlement panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has
ruled in favour of the US on most of the EU complaints brought against US
laws regulating vehicle fuel economy and luxury taxes.
The decision is also a setback for US opponents of the new Uruguay Round
deal, who have argued that the 'faceless bureaucrats' in Geneva will force
the US to change environmental and consumer laws.
The panel ruled in the EU's favour on one issue - that accounting rules,
established under the US Corporate Average Fuel Economy law (Cafe) were
inconsistent with Gatt.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said he would not ask
Congress to change the rules, as they 'do not have any actual economic
impact on EU auto manufacturers and therefore no trade damage results'. In a
written statement, US officials said Gatt had found for the first time that
conservation measures 'could excuse a country's law that was otherwise
inconsistent with the Gatt'.
Gatt set up an independent disputes panel in May 1993 to examine the EU's
allegation that US car taxes discriminate against European exports. The EU
claimed European car makers were paying a disproportionate share of the
three taxes - two of which penalise high fuel consumption, while the third
is a luxury tax on cars costing over Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 19,000).
Brussels had said the total revenue of the three taxes levied in 1991 was
Dollars 558m, of which Dollars 494m fell on European cars. European
manufacturers paid 100 per cent of penalties under the Cafe law, 80 per cent
of the 'gas-guzzler' tax, and 80 per cent of the luxury tax. European cars
had just 4 per cent of the US car market.
The EU argued that Cafe payments in discriminated against European luxury
car makers, as they were based on the sales-weighted average fuel
consumption of all models produced. Thus US producers who make cars in a
range of sizes, and Japanese makers of mostly small, fuel-efficient cars, do
not incur penalties.
The Cafe limits for company cars set an average fleet standard of 27.5 miles
per gallon (8.8 litres per 100km) and vehicles with a worse mileage are
taxed. The 'gas-guzzler' tax penalises other passenger cars that achieve
less than 22.5 mpg. Friends of the Earth in Washington, an environmental
group, says the Cafe law has led to savings of over 2.5m barrels of oil a
day.

ends

<TEXT>
Israel is expecting a rise in foreign investment following this weekend's
announcement by Saudi Arabia and the other five members of the Gulf
Co-operation Council that they will no longer boycott companies that trade
with Israel.
The GCC decision to end the so-called 'secondary' and 'tertiary' boycotts on
international companies that trade directly and indirectly with Israel was
announced after talks between the Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of
state, and GCC foreign ministers in New York. The GCC states also promised
to support any move in the Arab League to cancel the continuing direct
boycott of trade with Israel by much of the Arab world.
Israel's finance minister, Mr Avraham Shochat, predicted a significant boost
for the Israeli economy, with multinational companies reassessing their
positions. Some analysts claimed that national economy could expect a 1 to 2
per cent boost in annual growth. Others calculated that the cumulative
damage to the Israeli economy of the Arab boycott over the decades amounted
to between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 40bn.
The GCC decision was immediately attacked by the Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian
and Libyan governments, with Syria's foreign minister, Mr Farouq a-Shara,
arguing that the move was 'not timely'. The boycott is administered from
offices in Damascus.
The Syrian criticism undermined the political significance of the move. Mr
Christopher had been trying for months to win Syrian backing for an end to
the boycott, saying this would create a more positive atmosphere in Israel,
enabling Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, to win more support among the
Israeli electorate for peace moves with Syrian involving territorial
compromise on the Golan Heights.
The Israeli media highlighted GCC commitments soon to allow direct mail to
and from Israel, the entry of tourists and businessmen with Israeli stamps
in their passports, and the use of their air space by foreign aircraft
flying to and from Israel.
Tunisia yesterday took the first step towards normalising relations with
Israel by opening an interest section in Tel Aviv and allowing Israel to

Vietnam's first securities exchange is expected to open early next year, the
official Vietnam News Agency reported at the weekend. Quoting the central
State Bank, it said the exchange would start 'on a very small scale', with
trading in bonds issued by the government, local authorities, commercial
banks and state companies. Trading in shares of privatised state companies,
only a handful of which have so far issued stock to shareholders, will
follow later. The report confirmed that the State Bank and Finance
Ministry's joint committee on setting up the exchange intended to go ahead
despite the slow pace of privatisation. Vietnam, which currently has no
secondary markets, sees the stock exchange as a vital part of
market-oriented reforms launched in the late 1980s.

Turkey has threatened Greece with war if Athens extends its territorial

Soysal said yesterday. Mr Soysal said he issued the warning to his Greek
counterpart, Mr Karolos Papoulias, while both were at the UN General
Assembly last week. 'The Greek foreign minister told me that (Greece) had
the right to extend its waters to 12 miles. I said that would lead to very
serious consequences. We let it be known that we didn't want war but would
go to war in such a situation.' Mr Soysal has gained a reputation for being
tough on Turkey's traditional rival, Greece, since becoming foreign minister
in July. Though Nato allies, Turkey and Greece came to the brink of war in
1987 in a row over mineral rights in the Aegean.

Negotiations on measures to strengthen the 1972 treaty which outlaws
biological weapons will start next January, treaty members decided at the
weekend. After two weeks of difficult talks in Geneva, some 80 governments
agreed to establish an ad hoc group to draft proposals on verification,
anti-cheating measures and other compliance issues. But industrialised and
developing countries could not agree on how quickly to advance. The
industrialised countries want the group, open to all 131 treaty members, to
push on with a draft protocol for approval at the next treaty review
conference in 1996. But some developing countries want to proceed more
cautiously. The stage is set for arduous negotiations when the group
convenes in January.

Political tensions in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh were running high
last night, after police shot dead four demonstrators and injured 10. The
demonstrators were on their way to New Delhi for a rally in support of
demands for a separate state for the northern hills of Uttar Pradesh, where
many feel alienated from the plainsmen who dominate the state. The firing
occurred at Muzzafarnagar, 200km from Delhi. The Delhi rally of 50,000
people also turned violent when students, who have led the campaign for a
separate hill state, protested at the presence on the platform of national
politicians. Demands for a hill state have been revived after a decision by
the Uttar Pradesh administration, led by lower caste parties, to implement
laws reserving up to 50 per cent of government jobs and college places for
lower caste Hindus. The hill districts, where upper caste Hindus dominate,
erupted with protests. The conflict has thrown the state administration into
disarray and has embarrassed the Congress (I) party of Mr P V Narasimha Rao,
the prime minister.

Schools in Delhi, closed last week because of the plague which has hit
India, are to re-open tomorrow amid claims by health officials that the
disease is being brought under control. But Pakistan, meanwhile, has banned
entry of foreign nationals travelling from India because it fears spread of
the plague.
The Pakistanis said all travel between India and Pakistan had been suspended
except for returning Pakistani nationals, who will be subject to quarantine.
Pakistan put 28 foreign nationals in quarantine at the border village of
Wagha at the weekend, along with 320 returning Pakistanis. Officials said
they would install telephone lines for the stranded travellers, who included
12 Malaysians and nationals from Iran, Morocco, Canada, Bahrain, Germany,
Britain, Australia, South Africa, the US and Japan.
Delhi authorities decided said, medical reports indicated a very high
proportion of patients suspected of plague were in fact suffering from other
illnesses. The number of suspected cases in India rose by 1,600 at the
weekend to just over 4,050, according to the government's National Institute
of Communicable Diseases. The official death toll is just over 50.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Slovakia faces shift to extremes: Prospects of a right-left
alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Mr Vladimir Meciar, twice Slovakia's prime minister, had a commanding lead
after elections over the weekend, paving the way for an alliance among his
populist movement, socialists and extreme nationalists to form the country's
next government.
In a national turnout of 75 per cent, Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia (HZDS) won 35 per cent of the vote and a potential 58 seats in the
150-member parliament. That is more than three times as much as the party's
nearest rival, the former communists of the Democratic Left (SDL).
If Mr Meciar becomes prime minister it will shift Slovak politics away from
the centre ground occupied by the outgoing government and towards extremes
of both left and right.
Mr Meciar, who was ousted as prime minister in March, looks set to form the
next government in a coalition which could include the socialist Union of
Slovak Workers (ZRS), which won 7 per cent of the vote and the extreme
nationalists of the Slovak National party (SNS), which won 5.4 per cent.
The size of the HZDS victory took many observers by surprise. In the weeks
before voting on Friday and Saturday opinion polls had given the party no
more than 27-30 per cent of the vote. If the HZDS forms a coalition with the
ZRS and SNS it will have up to 81 seats in parliament, giving it a majority
of six.
As remarkable as the success of the HZDS was the collapse in support for the
SDL, which slumped to 10 per cent from 15 per cent at the last election in
June 1992, before Slovakia split from the Czech Republic. This has
effectively killed hopes of the return to office of the outgoing government,
of which the SDL was the dominant partner.
The outgoing prime minister, Mr Jozef Moravcik, whose Democratic Union (DU)
party, a breakaway unit of the HZDS, garnered 8.5 per cent of the vote,
conceded that there was little likelihood of his government remaining in
office. 'It will be difficult for the current government to stay together,'
he said. While Mr Meciar's appointment as prime minister is not yet
guaranteed, observers in Bratislava said yesterday that there were no other
likely candidates among senior HZDS officials. Mr Meciar's outsize
personality dominates the party.
If he is appointed, it leaves the way clear for him to carry out his
campaign promises to undo voucher privatisation, curb the growing influence
of Slovakia's ethnic-Hungarian minority and seek to oust President Michal
Kovac, the man who helped force him out of office as prime minister six
months ago over allegations of corruption.
Mr Moravcik's government had made hesitant progress towards restarting
voucher privatisation in Slovakia, and began a process of rapprochement with
Hungary over the issue of Slovakia's 560,000-strong ethnic Hungarian
minority.
The Hungarians are seeking greater autonomy over educational and cultural
affairs.
The HZDS is deeply suspicious of voucher privatisation because it allows
control of state assets to pass to what Mr Meciar terms 'anonymous persons'.
His potential coalition partners are of a like mind, the ZRS fearing huge
job losses as companies restructure under new ownership, and the SNS wanting
complete state control over the economy, as in the communist era.
Mr Meciar might have difficulty in reversing the voucher programme, though
he is expected to try.
Nearly 1m Slovaks have bought vouchers which they can exchange for shares in
a range of state companies the outgoing government has earmarked for
inclusion in the programme.
'He can certainly interrupt it, but he may not be able to stop it,' one
observer said. 'It will be difficult to buy back all those vouchers.'
Both HZDS and SNS are fiercely opposed to greater autonomy for ethnic
Hungarians, who make up more than 10 per cent of Slovakia's population,
regarding such a move as tantamount to secession.
Relations with Hungary have been cool since independence, and progress on
drafting a comprehensive agreement between the two countries, begun under Mr
Moravcik and tentatively scheduled to be ready next February, could now be
in jeopardy.
Mr Meciar's greatest problem might yet lie in his relations with Mr Kovac.
Mr Kovac orchestrated the campaign that ousted Mr Meciar in March, alleging
widespread corruption in privatisation. In the last hours of his
administration Mr Meciar approved more than 40 deals to sell state assets to
their managers. The bitterness in relations between the two men, once allies
in the HZDS, will make co-operation extremely difficult.
It is still possible that the ZRS, with 13 seats, will decline to go into
coalition with the HZDS. It seems unlikely that the party's leader, Mr Jan
Luptak, would join a coalition with Mr Meciar because of his opposition to
privatisation, but he may yet agree to support such a government informally.
In that case Mr Moravcik could also count on the support of the
ethnic-Hungarian parties, which will have 18 seats. A coalition of the DU,
the FDL and the Christian Democrats with the support of the ZRS and the
Hungarians would give Mr Moravcik 82 seats but a more unwieldy coalition
than Mr Meciar could put together.
Whatever the make-up of the next government this election has failed to
bring Slovakia much-needed stability.
There is some concern that the confusion and instability that characterised
Mr Meciar's two previous governments may return if he forms the next
administration.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The fall in the rouble is 'very dangerous' to the Russian government and
could push reform off course because the government would lose the fragile
confidence it created in the country earlier this year, according to the
senior official concerned with the Russian budget.
Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance minister, said, however, that his
government was still prepared to take 'unpopular' measures in order to
attract international financial support for a reform programme.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Alexashenko said that there was very little
the government could do to stem the flight from the rouble to the dollar. Mr
Alexashenko said that the central bank had spent more than Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1.2bn) defending the rouble in the past two to three months and on
his calculation had only Dollars 4bn-Dollars 4.5bn left - 'and after that,
what, clearly, there is nothing'.
The rouble has lost more than 16 per cent of its value against the dollar in
the past week and at close of trading on Friday stood at Rbs2,633 to the
dollar.
The deputy minister said that 'there will be a drastic rise in the
inflationary expectations of the people, and of course an increase in
inflation itself - and in the medium term an increase in government
expenditure. But the psychological result will be the mistrust of government
policy and a continued outflow of funds from the rouble to hard currencies.'
Mr Alexashenko - a young economist who was formerly in the 'expert group'
created by Professor Yevgeny Yasin, now a presidential adviser - has emerged
as a key player in the battle to keep the government's tight money strategy
on course and to argue with the international financial institutions for
increased support. Brought into the government less than a year ago, he says
that 'the government of (prime minister Victor) Chernomyrdin is much tougher
than (former prime minister Yegor) Gaidar's. This prime minister says No to
everything.'
Speaking in a break between hectic talks on the 1995 budget - already
delayed in its promised delivery to the parliament - he said the assumptions
for that budget would also be thrown into confusion by a continuing plunge
in the value of the rouble. 'We were assuming a certain dynamic in the
exchange rate. we did not expect such a devaluation.
'If this continues we will have to change the budget's parameters - and cut
down on expenditure. The process will be very hard.'
The International Monetary Fund, now at its annual conclave in Madrid,
should 'make clear its view one way or the other,' said Mr Alexashenko. 'For
two years we had a lot of promises but little aid delivered.
'Now I believe the government is ready to take even unpopular decisions  -
but I'm not sure that either the IMF or the Group of Seven are ready to say
what measures they will support,' he said.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Tragedy overshadows PM's demise: John Lloyd talks to
Estonia's ousted leader whose success was clouded by secret deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After last week's tragic events in Estonia, the fall of Mr Mart Laar, prime
minister of the country for two years, has been sidelined. The sinking of
the ferry Estonia revealed a country still uncertain of its capacities to
absorb the technical, organisational and moral consequences of the disaster:
but the forced resignation of Mr Laar has so far shown a political nation
determined to observe a constitutional order still in its infancy.
Estonia is by some way the most successful of the former Soviet states in
sloughing off a forced Sovietisation, and Mr Laar, in what was by
post-communist standards a long premiership, was the central figure in the
success. Dr Werner Unger, the former German ambassador to the European
Commission, in Tallinn last week to advise on the country's efforts to
accede to the European Union, ran through a checklist of achievements: 'A
pluralistic democracy, a market economy, liberalised trade, 60 per cent of
enterprises privatised, GDP growing, unemployment (1.8 per cent) much lower
than western Europe, no budget deficit, public debt 5 per cent of GDP,
exports growing, imports growing more rapidly because of the purchase of
investment goods and an influx of foreign investment. Wonderful.'
Why on earth should a prime minister go after all of that? Because he was
seen to conceal vital matters from parliament, a grave matter in a
plain-speaking state. Soon after his accession to office in October 1992, he
and Mr Siim Kallas, chairman of the Estonian central bank, sold nearly
Rbs2bn which had been dumped in the bank just before the country adopted its
own kroon currency - to Chechnya, the rebel Russian republic. It was done
secretly, by intermediaries who were close to the prime minister, and it
came to light only this year; it was underscored by the revelation of
another secret Laar deal: to buy small arms from Israel for Estonia's new
armed forces.
The case against is that Mr Laar concealed the deal, and may have allowed
intermediaries to benefit (there has been no public charge that he benefited
himself) and thus damaged a still fragile democratic system. His defence,
vigorously put in an interview, is that 'there was no time for discussion;
Kallas and I were the monetary committee charged with all matters affecting
the introduction of the new currency; and frankly, the money helped us
enormously in making the budget.'
The three-to-one vote against him in the parliament last week he interprets
as a signal that the parties in coalition with his Pro Patria group, unable
to sustain the hard pounding attendant on severe observance of a tight money
programme, were seeking ways out. The social democrats, whose defection
sealed his fate, left because they could not get a rise in the low
unemployment benefit. For the neo-liberal Mr Laar, issues like these are
fundamental. 'We have been pressing hard on the people out of work to get
other jobs. We won't increase the benefit except to those who take training
for new jobs. And you see the result: low unemployment.'
The two institutions which have done most to ingrain the market culture into
Estonia - the Laar cabinet and the central bank - remain very largely
confident that they have shorn up capitalism against any future ruin.
Nowhere else in the post- Soviet mosaic has such a self-confident cadre of
reformers emerged. Mr Enn Teimann, the deputy chairman of the bank, says
that 'the legislation of the country (which forbids the central bank to lend
money to the budget) will not allow irresponsibility. It is possible that
politicians can change this but I don't fear it.'
The prime minister, who had in parliament warned that Estonia was still a
fragile country vulnerable to populism, appeared to largely discount that:
'It would be very hard. There has been such a change of character in the
people. The old communist nomenclatura has no base.'
Mr Laar's optimism is bolstered by the fact that his partner in the
concealed rouble deal, central bank chairman Kallas, has emerged as the
candidate of the right for prime minister, and is supported by some of those
who passed the vote of censure on the prime minister.
The opposition parties are very much divided: the only candidate talked of
is Mr Tiit Vahi, briefly prime minister before Mr Laar, who, says the
latter, left him a legacy of high inflation and an untackled structural
crisis. 'For the first months I had an appointment book which was full from
morning to night with meetings with directors, who wanted the cheap credit
they had always got. I told each of them 'you cannot get it'.'
Choosing a new prime minister is the task of Mr Lennart Meri, the president
 -a role with limited powers which, Mr Laar (no ally) says he constantly
tried to exceed. Mr Meri, consumed last week with the dolorous task of
giving public representation to his country's loss, will this week resume
the talks with faction leaders from which a candidate should come. His own
preference is for a centrist figure: Mr Kallas is not that. Estonia may be
in for a change of course: but it will not be fundamental.

FT  03 OCT 94 / German seeks new cartel body for EU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European anti-trust decisions should be made by an independent authority
instead of the European Commission in order to reduce political
interference, the head of the German cartel office has told the Financial
Times.
Mr Dieter Wolf said he hopes Germany will place such a proposal on the
agenda of the Intergovernmental Meeting scheduled for 1996.
Mr Wolf, a staunch advocate of reducing political influence in mergers and
anti-trust decisions, said the current decision-making structures in
Brussels were not transparent enough and were often susceptible to
'political lobbies'.
'I am not blaming the Commissioners for this. But it is a consequence of the
structure of decision-making. Every commissioner has different tasks to
fulfil. But he is also a politician. His understanding of the task is also a
political one,' said Mr Wolf.
What concerns the cartel office, which has often been criticised for not
taking a more robust attitude towards mergers within Germany, especially in
the retailing and media sectors, is that there are too many interest groups
in Brussels lobbying behind the scenes on anti-trust decisions. 'It is
sometimes unclear why some merger decisions are made,' he said, adding that
'Brussels wants to keep the monopoly of granting exemptions from
(individual) cartel prohibitions'.
'Merger decisions contain sharp interventions from the state into the
market. Take the case of capital allocation,' he said. 'If there is a
proposal for a merger between a French and a German company it is clear (the
decision) has direct repercussions on where the investments will take place.
It involves getting influence on the flow of capital. Maybe this is very
attractive and seductive for politics. But that is why it makes it all the
more necessary for an independent body to decide on the basis of law.'
Mr Wolf, however, denied suggestions that the independent body would be
modelled on Germany's own cartel office, which he claimed was 'completely
independent from political interference'.
Instead, as a first step he proposed that it be controlled by the European
Court in Luxembourg.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Calls for Crimea to lose its autonomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Crimea's ongoing political struggle is prompting increasingly loud calls in
Kiev for the Ukrainian peninsula's status as an autonomous republic to be
revoked.
This follows the Crimean parliament's decision on Thursday to strip
President Yuri Meshkov of most powers, as it did a month before. Mr Meshkov
at that time suspended parliament but later relented without the row being
resolved.
If the crisis continues, Kiev must take direct control of Crimea, said Mr
Vladimir Mukhin, the Ukrainian parliament's defence committee chairman.
While Moscow considers the present dispute an internal Ukrainian matter, any
move to weaken the republic's autonomous status might bring Russian
involvement.
Transferred to Ukraine in 1954, the peninsula is the sorest point in
relations between Russia and Ukraine since the Soviet Union's collapse in
1991. Under pressure from Russian nationalists, a clause on Ukrainian
territorial integrity leaving Crimea outside Russia is the main issue
holding up agreement on a Ukrainian-Russian co-operation treaty under
discussion.
Crimean deputies today are expected to consider amending the constitution to
validate last week's step, which Mr Meshkov called a 'coup d'etat'.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Ferry evacuation rules questioned: The Estonia disaster may
lead to a review of emergency procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The catastrophic failure of lifeboats and life rafts to save passengers in
last week's Baltic ferry disaster is set to bring demands for a review of
emergency procedures on passenger vessels as well as the review promised by
the International Maritime Organisation of the design of roll-on, roll-off
ships.
One of the most distressing sights from the rescue operation of the Estonia,
which capsized and sank with the loss of more than 900 lives, was of dozens
of life rafts discovered either empty, or in many cases swamped by icy water
and containing the bodies of people who drowned or died of exposure despite
managing to clamber aboard the rubber boats. Only a handful of the Estonia's
large lifeboats were even launched.
'I can agree that the equipment was not doing its job since so many died,
but it is up to the rule makers and designers to look into this,' Mr Sten
Forsberg, technical director of Nordstrom and Thulin, the Swedish
co-operator of the Estonia, said at the weekend. 'I am quite sure that the
aftermath of this tremendous tragedy will result in stricter regulations for
life-saving equipment.'
The chilling evidence from the Estonia suggests that in a case where a ship
lists suddenly and heavily, the ordered evacuation of passengers in
lifeboats and life rafts can quickly become virtually impossible -
especially in storm conditions and with panic surging through a stricken
ship. A spokeswoman for the Viking Line, a Finnish-based operator in the
Baltic which used to run the Estonia, said that in the best conditions
preparing and launching lifeboats took 15 to 20 minutes, 'but in conditions
like those faced by the Estonia, the system can quickly break down.'
Ship operators say lifeboats cannot be launched if a ship is listing more
than 15 degrees. But in heavy seas, a lesser list may make launching
impossible. As lifeboats and many life rafts are designed to be loaded with
passengers before being lowered into the water, this means that even in
conditions much less severe than those faced by the Estonia, evacuating
passengers by lifeboat fails.
The Estonia carried rubber life rafts packed in plastic containers. The
rafts were designed to pop up to the surface and self-inflate once submerged
below a depth of four metres - which they did. But most, clearly, were
easily swamped by the high seas, as water washed in through the door in
their weatherproof covers. One survivor said the raft he clambered on to was
upside down.
The Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri on Saturday quoted Mr Jens Peter Bie,
an executive at the Danish company Viking Life-Saving Equipment, which
supplied life rafts to the Estonia, as saying the rafts on the ship were 14
years old. He said newer, self-inflating and self-righting rafts were
available, but ship owners were deterred from buying them by costs 30-40 per
cent greater than standard rafts.
Mr Harri Kulovara, operations chief for the Finnish-run Silja Line, said: 'I
believe the rubber life rafts can be more effective than the traditional
lifeboats - they are much easier to launch and use. But they must be
launched properly.'
Questions have also been raised since the Estonia disaster about the way
ferry operators brief passengers on emergency procedures. The requirement
under IMO regulations falls well short of the obligatory safety
demonstrations made on airlines.
No lifeboat drill is required on the 12-14 hour overnight sailings that are
the common duration on the Baltic routes and none is offered by the
operators.
Swedish and Finnish operators say their crews are regularly drilled to cope
with emergencies. They make public announcements to stress to passengers the
importance of reading the emergency procedure notices and run videos on
passenger TV services.
However, as the Estonia catastrophe showed, even the best prepared crews and
passengers can be quickly overcome when a ship begins to list and sink.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Brussels steel plan expected to collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The European Commission's plan to cut steel output is as good as dead,
according to German steelmakers who say it will be impossible to reach
agreement now that economic recovery is picking up across Europe.
German steel companies have indicated they are prepared to let the plan
collapse and wait for the next recession before trying once more to agree on
capacity cuts.
They are also happy to forego the aid package promised by the European
Commission if the capacity cuts are agreed in full. This includes finance
for redundancies, protection from cheaper eastern European imports and a
quarterly system for monitoring steel output.
Any threat to the capacity cuts plan would be a big setback for Brussels,
which has spent nearly two years cajoling steelmakers across Europe to cut
capacity as Europe dragged itself through its worst post-war recession.
The latest development, however, vindicates the fears of some steel industry
observers and private sector producers that a short-term rise in demand
might be used as an excuse to postpone cuts designed to correct chronic
overcapacity.
Last week at an EU ministerial meeting Mr Gunther Rexrodt, German economics
minister, strongly criticised the steel industry for asking the commission
to devise a rescue plan when times were hard, but abandoning it as soon as
prices picked up.
'It is not good practice for the industry to enjoy support when things are
bad and then to not reduce capacity when things get better,' he said.
He spoke shortly after Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, announced
that unless the EU's steel sector had produced the minimum level of cuts in
capacity by November 8, the commission would withdraw its support.
So far industry has only achieved 11m tonnes of capacity cuts and is
unlikely to meet the 19m minimum required under the plan by the beginning of
November.
'The same thing happened in 1985 for the first big steel crisis,' said a
senior commission official. 'Reductions in capacity then were below what was
necessary, and this led to the second steel crisis in 1991.'
But in Germany, one industry source said: 'The plan is as good as dead - you
can forget about further capacity cuts. Take hot-rolling capacity  - we're
working flat out. We need more capacity.'
The German Steel Federation said last week that output this year was
expected to be 10 per cent higher than last year and that prices were
beginning to improve. It said the German steel industry had shed 140,000
jobs over the last five years, costing producers about DM4bn (Pounds 1.6bn),
and that it had made all the capacity cuts which could be expected,
including last year's closure by Krupp Hoesch of its Rheinhausen plant.
Instead the Germans have pointed the finger at subsidised state-owned
Italian and Spanish steelmakers for not doing their part.
German steelmakers may also argue that capacity cuts make little sense given
that the future of Eko Stahl, the ailing steel plant in eastern Germany, is
still uncertain.
Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steel group, and the Bremen-based Hegemann
group are leading the race for a stake in Eko Stahl and both have indicated
they would invest in a hot-rolling mill which would probably produce about
2m tonnes annually.
Last month British Steel said European demand for strip mill products had
risen significantly over recent months, and was expected to continue to
strengthen. But there was also a shortage of steel, due partly to temporary
closures of some European blast furnaces for relining.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Walesa makes his peace with Solidarity union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Lech Walesa made peace with the Solidarity trade union movement
and attacked Poland's centre-left coalition government at the weekend for
slowing down reform, in the opening salvoes of what promises to be a long
campaign to win him a second term in elections due in November 1995.
'The left wing's paw has grown too large,' he told sceptical delegates at
Solidarity's annual congress. Mr Walesa led the movement to victory over the
communists five years ago but the union last year refused to invite him, for
failing to support the movement's shop floor aims and being 'too soft' on
the former communists, the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD). The SLD has been
in government with the PSL farmers' party since the autumn of 1993.
'Old methods of government are returning, Poland faces the threat of
stagnation,' Mr Walesa said as he appealed to the union to agree to become
part of a federation of Solidarity-based parties to win parliamentary
elections in 1997 and next year's presidential ballot.
Soon after the president's speech Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister,
went on television to say that Poland's Mass Privatisation Scheme (MPP),
covering 460 state sector enterprises, would be going ahead ahead. Mr Pawlak
has recently come under attack from opposition politicians and the media for
delaying the scheme, under which the Polish people are to be given shares in
specially established investment funds.
The funds, which will stay in existence for 10 years, are in turn to be
handed equity in the 460 companies.
The scheme has acquired a significance far outweighing its actual impact on
privatising Poland's 5,000 or so state sector enterprises as both the World
Bank and the IMF have made disbursement of loans, helping to finance
Poland's recent London Club commercial bank debt reduction deal, conditional
on the MPP moving ahead.
Mr Pawlak, however, dismissed opposition warnings that Poland's standing
with these institutions would plummet and the debt agreements collapse as a
result of the delay since July. Instead Mr Pawlak explained he was worried
that foreign fund managers were being given too great a role in the MPP.
He also expressed his view that the enterprises which were to be privatised
through the scheme had been undervalued.
Once these doubts had been removed the plan would go ahead, Mr Pawlak said.
A cabinet meeting is to examine the programme tommorrow.

FT  03 OCT 94 / BSkyB to decide on flotation in London and New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting will have to decide this week if it is to go ahead
with a flotation before Christmas on the London and New York stock
exchanges.
Shareholders of the satellite television venture have been in talks for the
past month trying to agree on a flotation that would value the company at
more than Pounds 4bn.
Immediate agreement would allow a share issue to go ahead between now and
Christmas - when most new satellite dishes and subscriptions are sold.
If this opportunity is missed, conditions for a flotation might not be as
favourable again until autumn next year.
Unanimous agreement is almost certainly needed between the main shareholders
 -Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation; Chargeurs, the French transport and
media group; Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times; and
Granada, the media, leisure and computer services company.
A flotation would be difficult to organise without the agreement of all the
main shareholders because the four have pre-emption rights to buy if any of
the others want to sell.
In addition, there are complex tax issues involved in replacing debt with
equity. Mr Murdoch, who is being advised by Goldman Sachs, is keen to float,
primarily in order to reduce debt and release capital to invest in his Asian
satellite venture, Star TV.
There may also be a political dimension. A future Labour government might
present News Corp with the choice of selling its national newspapers or
reducing its 50 per cent stake in BSkyB. The latest date for the next
general election in the UK is 1997.
Of the other main shareholders, Granada has frequently made clear that it
would sell its 13.5 per cent stake under the right conditions. Pearson,
which is being advised by Lazard Brothers, has suggested it might be
interested in increasing its stake in BSkyB, which lifted its operating
profits in the year to June from Pounds 54.1m to Pounds 176.8m. However, it
is not thought to be averse to a flotation.
The main obstacle to a flotation appears to be Chargeurs, which does not
have a pressing need for funds and believes the value of the satellite
company will rise. It may decide to hold on to its stake.
One possibility under consideration is to sell shares directly to 3.45m
subscribers, 74 per cent receiving the television channels on dishes, with
most of the rest attached to cable networks.
At the weekend BSkyB added five new services to its Sky Multi-Channels
package and increased all subscription charges by Pounds 3 a month.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Sharp increase in UK insider dealing probes: Stock exchange
says rise reflects higher rate of detection rather than greater number of
offences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been a sharp increase in possible insider trading cases detected
by the London Stock Exchange, according to a Financial Times analysis based
on unpublished official figures.
The exchange's surveillance group, whose role is to scrutinise every share
deal for signs of criminal activity, has opened 116 cases for investigation
so far this year, including more than 75 into alleged insider trading.
That represents an effective rise of around 50 per cent over the year
before.
Mr Michael Lawrence, the exchange's chief executive, wants to make the
market safer for investors who do not have inside information.
A series of measures is under consideration to ensure anyone buying and
selling shares through a London securities house will not be severely
disadvantaged if he or she has access only to published information.
'We do not want to have the image of London as a place where you can do
insider trading and get away with it,' he said. These measures will be aimed
primarily at pre-empting insider trading by making better use of the new
computerised Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance System, which the
exchange uses to detect unusual price movements or anomalous transactions.
In the past nine months, the exchange has referred 10 possible cases of
insider trading - the making of illegal profits from trading in shares when
in possession of confidential price-sensitive information - to the
Department of Trade and Industry. That compares with seven in the whole of
1993.
According to officials, this reflects an increased detection rate rather
than a rise in the incidence of the offence.
The DTI has the power to appoint inspectors to carry out formal insider
dealing investigations under the Financial Services Act, after receiving
case files from the exchange, and also decides whether to prosecute. So far
this year it has appointed inspectors in just five cases, including that of
Lord Archer's order to purchase 50,000 Anglia Television shares, and there
has been just one trial.
The disclosure of the improved performance of the surveillance group is
likely to increase pressure on the government to reform the law to improve
the chances of achieving successful prosecutions against suspected insider
traders.
The DTI and the exchange have been widely criticised because, in the 14
years since insider trading became illegal in the UK, just 23 individuals
have been found guilty of the offence.
'My concern is that the Exchange itself is brought into disrepute if there
is not enough punishment,' said Mr Lawrence.
Part of the reason for the low prosecution record is widely believed to lie
in the criminal, as opposed to civil, nature of the misdemeanour. The burden
of proving beyond any reasonable doubt, as is required in a criminal case,
that someone possessed inside information when dealing and then proving that
the motive for the transaction was to profit from that information - and
that there was no other motive - has frequently been impossible.

FT  03 OCT 94 / IMF thrown into disarray over plan to lift reserves: G7
officials blame fund managing director for breakdown of negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The world's system of international monetary co-operation was thrown into
crisis last night after members of the International Monetary Fund failed to
agree on plans to boost the world's monetary reserves by Dollars 23.5bn
(Pounds 14.8bn).
An acrimonious meeting of the IMF's policymaking interim committee ended
with a vague agreement to raise the ability of IMF members to borrow from
the fund in times of trouble.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, who played a key role in the
negotiations, said the outcome was 'disappointing'. Mr Clarke had pressed
other IMF members to accept a selective issue of the IMF's own reserve asset
 -known as the special drawing right - to boost their international
reserves.
'One or two key players who had presented standards of high principle' had
blocked agreement, the chancellor said.
As a result, the big industrial countries had been unable to boost the
monetary reserves of poor developing countries and the mainly former
communist states, including Russia, that had become IMF members since 1981.
Mr Clarke said there was little chance of reviving the scheme. Also lost
were plans to boost the systemic transformation facility, set up by the IMF
to give financial help to former communist countries.
The interim committee was plunged into what one official described as a
'flaming row' after developing countries refused to accept proposals from
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations that they should accept a
selective increase in global reserves of SDR16bn.
The developing countries said that was inadequate and pinned their faith on
Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, who had long campaigned for
a general increase of SDR36bn, benefiting all members.
At the end of the meeting, G7 officials said much of the blame for the
breakdown lay with Mr Camdessus. Some officials said the status of the IMF
as an international financial institution could be undermined by the
seemingly arcane dispute.
The officials said Mr Camdessus had caused poor developing countries to
believe that there was more on offer while the G7 proposal was the 'only
show in town'. The managing director appeared unwilling to reflect the views
of the industrial countries that have a clear majority of votes on the
Fund's board.
G7 officials said Mr Camdessus had alienated Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US
Treasury secretary and representative of the fund's biggest shareholder,
through his constant campaigning for a larger general SDR increase and
failing to back the G7 view.
However, Mr Camdessus was unrepentant at a midnight press conference. He
denied it was his job to represent G7 views and insisted he would not be
resigning from his post.
Yesterday's meetings began hopefully enough. The discussions in the interim
committee followed the unanimous agreement of the G7 on Saturday, although
it emerged that France had accepted the UK-US plan only grudgingly.
The SDR issue - the first since 1981 - was specially structured to benefit
37 countries, including Russia, that had no SDRs in their reserves. It was
also designed to strengthen the reserves, and hence the import capability,
of developing nations.

FT  03 OCT 94 / Japan and US reach partial agreement on trade
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US and Japan both claimed victory yesterday after reaching a partial
settlement of their long-running trade dispute. The deal averts the
immediate threat of a trade war between the world's two largest economies.
The agreement on opening Japan's markets to US goods and services is also
expected to influence currency markets, which had strengthened the yen on
fears that the two countries would be unable to resolve the conflict. The
last-minute negotiations resulted in agreement on opening the Japanese
glass, insurance and government procurement markets - the first results of
14 months of tough talks under the framework pact.
However, the two sides were unable to reach a deal to lower barriers in
Japan's car and car parts market. Foreign producers capture just 2.6 per
cent of total sales in Japan, compared with 47 per cent in the US. Japanese
car and car parts exports account for 60 per cent of the US's Dollars 60bn
(Pounds 37.9bn) annual trade deficit with Japan.
The US will start investigating Japan's replacement car parts market under
Section 301 of US trade law, which could lead to sanctions in 12 to 18
months.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, said Japan's car market remained
discriminatory but noted Japan's willingness to reach deals in other areas.
In spite of the US move, Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, Japan's trade minister, said
Tokyo was open to further discussion with the US on the issue.
However, the two sides were likely to benefit from a cooling-off period
before resuming discussions, he said. 'In the area of auto and auto parts it
is very regrettable that despite vigorous efforts in sincere discussions
since July last year, the US government has decided to initiate a Section
301 investigation provide the Japanese government of Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama with a welcome respite from one potentially explosive issue.
Meanwhile, with the immediate danger of sanctions behind them, officials
were able to congratulate themselves on having averted another sharp jump in
the yen's value, which could have undermined the country's anaemic recovery.
Mr Hashimoto and Mr Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, have earned their
reputations as capable negotiators, able to stand up against persistent US
pressure for numerical targets.
US companies in industries where the two sides reached agreement on
market-opening measures welcomed the outcome.
Mr Ralph Gerson, president of Guardian International, a glass maker, said:
'We are very pleased after long and difficult negotiations that US
negotiators have achieved agreement on the key principles that will finally
open the Japanese glass market to real competition.'

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government's decision to sell its remaining stakes in the two English
power generators dominated the new issue market this week.
Developments have also been announced at a couple of placings: Games
Workshop, a hobby games manufacturing concern, and Filtronic, a
telecommunication components supplier.
Ashbourne Holdings, a nursing homes business, said it would be getting a
quote and allocations were announced for the ED&amp;F Man offer (see page 8,
main paper.)
The government is aiming to use the Pounds 4bn sale of its remaining 40 per
cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen next February to widen share
ownership further. Private investors will be offered two-fifths of the
available shares at discount prices and the proportion will rise if demand
requires it.
To qualify for the discounts investors must apply through the 'share shops'
of banks, building societies, stockbrokers and other financial
intermediaries, rather than through forms in newspaper advertisements.
The government expects to begin marketing the sale in January which will be
the first opportunity for people to register. Payments will be in three
instalments, each in a different tax year.
The prices will be determined following bids from institutional investors in
two separate, open-priced international tenders. The international offer
will include a retail tender to enable individuals to bid for shares in
either or both companies on similar terms to institutions.
Small investors in the UK will be able to buy only a package of shares in
both companies, with a pre-determined ratio, possibly three National Power
to two PowerGen. Discounts to the public will be reflected in a lower first
instalment.
Existing shareholders will need to register with share shops to be eligible
for incentives and preferences in allocation over other applicants.
Shares in Games Workshop have been priced at 115p, which will give the
games' manufacturer a market capitalisation of Pounds 36m. Around Pounds 12m
is being raised through the float, which is being undertaken through a
placing sponsored by Samuel Montagu.
Filtronic, which supplies micro-components to the mobile telecommunications
industry, is also coming to the market via a Pounds 25m placing. The
prospectus is due to be issued on October 18, with dealing commencing around
a week later.
Ashbourne Holdings, one of Britain's largest nursing home businesses, has
announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the company at up to
Pounds 90m.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Indian trade hit by plague panic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
India's businessmen were yesterday counting the growing economic cost of the
plague, with tourism and food exports the two sectors hardest hit.
The disease, which has killed about 50 people with another 2,500 cases
suspected, has disrupted the travel trade and exports. Hotels and tour
operators, gearing up for the tourist season, have reported cancellations by
groups from Europe, the Far East and North America. Some business visitors
have cancelled trips. At least three trade fairs have been postponed.
Trade with the Gulf states, worth Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) a year, has
been badly affected by Gulf governments' decisions to close air and sea
links with India. The biggest impact is on exporters of fresh food, who rely
on the Gulf for 70 per cent of overseas sales, worth Dollars 177m last year.
'After three years of effort in promoting exports we are back at square
one,' said Mr Gian Nega, assistant director of the Agricultural and
Processed Food Products Export Development Authority.
Health officials, including Dr NK Shah, the resident representative of the
World Health Organisation, accused the Gulf countries and other states that
have cut trade links of over-reacting.
The Indian government has launched a campaign aimed at calming the fears of
tourists, business travellers and importers of Indian goods. Mr T. Khanna,
commerce secretary, expressed concern at the potential damage to Indian
trade. 'There has been a panic reaction from some of our trading partners.
But I believe it will soon blow over.'
In London, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said the countries that
had imposed restrictions on travel and imports risked hampering efforts to
deal with the problem. 'We are trying to create an atmosphere where people
have confidence that plague is no longer an incurable disease,' he said.
An official of KLM, the Dutch airline, in Delhi estimated that 25-30 per
cent of tourists who had planned to travel to India by KLM this week and
next had cancelled. Other European airlines, including British Airways,
Lufthansa and Swissair, also reported cancellations by tourist groups.
The disease claimed two lives in the capital, Delhi, yesterday - the first
reported deaths outside the western city of Surat where plague broke out
last week.
In the the UK, the health department said yesterday its plague surveillance
system had identified eight people showing flu-like symptoms 'who may be
infected'. But the Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre said later that
medical tests had cleared seven, while the eighth was unlikely to have the
plague.

FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa and Thai Airways in
link talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lufthansa is negotiating a co-operation agreement with Thai Airways with the
aim of fashioning a network spanning the world, according to Mr Jurgen
Weber, chairman.
The German flag-carrier, which earlier this week offered 5m shares at DM182
(Dollars 118.10) each in a heavily oversubscribed combined rights issue and
placing operation, said it expected talks to be completed before the end of
November.
A deal with the Thai flag-carrier would provide a crucial link in
Lufthansa's growing list of partnerships built around an agreement with
United Airlines of the US, which already co-operates with Thai.
Meanwhile, Dresdner Bank, which led a book-building exercise for this week's
capital-raising, said 3.9m shares offered in the rights issue had been
widely distributed among private international investors.
A further 1.1m from the federal government's holding had been placed.
Heavy demand had enabled the offering to be priced at only a small discount
 -DM2 - to Thursday's Frankfurt stock market closing price of DM184, it
said.
The issue and placing marked a decisive change in Lufthansa's status. The
sale of government stock and Bonn's non-participation in the rights issue
mean the government no longer holds a majority.
It plans to reduce its stake further in the next year or two.

FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Halifax fund management move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax Building Society is to set up its own fund management operation, as
part of the strategy that sees it setting up its own life company and unit
trust subsidiaries in January.
It has appointed Gartmore and Morgan Grenfell Asset Management to undertake
the fund management, along with the in-house team which is already managing
the society's Pounds 1bn staff pension fund.
The society, the UK's largest, announced last autumn that it was ending its
'tie' with Standard Life. The arrangement meant that the only financial
services products sold through the Halifax branch network were those from
the mutual insurer.
One of the reasons for the Halifax decision to set up its own life company
was the desire to have more say over the financial products it sold, and
yesterday's announcement is a further indication of its intention of
controlling the full process.
Gartmore, Morgan Grenfell and the Halifax investment team will each manage
about one-third of the funds from the life and unit trust subsidiaries.
Gartmore's brief is said to have a 'growth tilt' while Mortgage Grenfell's
remit has more emphasis on income.
Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive, yesterday highlighted the important of
assuming responsibility for 'the quality of the financial solution' suitable
for the society's customers' needs' and placing this under the society's
brand.
It would, he said, provide a 'spur' to the organisation's continuing
customer service efforts.
One of the changes that will accompany the setting up of the society's own
operations will be a move to giving staff similar commissions across the
range of financial services policies, instead of giving different incentives
depending on the type of investment product sold.
Both Gartmore and Morgan Grenfell said Halifax was potentially a very
significant client.
Gartmore has more than Pounds 20bn group funds under management, while
Morgan Grenfell has Pounds 30bn funds under management.
Among other large societies, the fund management for Woolwich Building
Society's life and unit trust subsidiaries is conducted by Mercury Asset
Management.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Tribals win long autonomy struggle
</HEADLINE>

   PATNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Jharkhand, a mineral-rich region of Bihar, India's second most populous
state, is to be granted wide autonomy, marking a breakthrough in a 50-year
struggle for self-determination.
An agreement this week between the central government and the state of
Bihar, provides for establishment of an autonomous council in Jharkhand, the
southern half of the state.
It is by far the largest Indian region to be granted such status; most
previous cases have involved small pockets of tribal land. In a campaign
which pre-dated the end of the British Raj, a separate identity for
Jharkhand had been sought by the area's aboriginal peoples, but backing had
also come from some industrial houses.
They argued that the Bihar administration, based in Patna, the state capital
to the north, had long neglected their needs while reaping tax benefits from
their activities.
Successive state governments of different political hues are said to have
built a bureaucracy on the back of revenues from mining and industry, almost
entirely concentrated in Jharkhand, while Bihar is India's poorest state.
The estimated 40m people of Jharkhand will now gain their own assembly, with
Bihar entitled to nominate 10 per cent of its members. The new entity is
expected to control sectors such as agriculture, education and health.
Northern Biharis appear reconciled to the break, which some see as a prelude
either to full statehood for Jharkhand or it turning into a union territory
dealing direct with Delhi.
A Bihar government official said the tribal south had long enjoyed special
status and state income would not be affected. But the move may encourage
further development in Jharkhand, which apart from coal, bauxite and copper
has a prime deposit of mica, a substance with applications in computer
technology.

Peru's government will have to assume a controversial and long-standing

to renegotiation of Peru's Dollars 6.5bn commercial banking debt. The debt,
thought to stand at around Dollars 72m with accumulated interest, dates back
to 1981 when US banks backed the commercially disastrous purchase of two
cargo ships by the then state-owned shipping line.

To be born with a fear of heights when your home is a gothic abbey almost as
tall as Notre-Dame looks like some kind of divine jest. Not so for Diane
d'Allaines, the owner of a former Cistercian monastery in the south of
France. Valmagne Abbey is the one place in the world where vertigo does not
bother her.
Indeed, the proprietress of Valmagne appears altogether undaunted by the
place. She was born there and knows it so well, she says, that she can find
her way blindfolded.
I asked her if she ever saw monks shuffling in the gloom.
'No,' she replied. Yet her tone of voice was ambiguous.
Why do you hesitate?
'Because if you go to the cloister, very often you hear voices.' She paused.
'But I don't believe in ghosts.'
No, of course. What sort of voices?
'It's - how do you call that in English? - chuchoter. Whispering. Yesterday
I went to the cloister and thought 'But there's somebody there]' No. No one.
It's a sort of whisper.'
Is it frightening?
'Oh, no, no, no] You can't be afraid here.'
Valmagne stands on a southern incline within sight of the Mediterranean and
the oyster-beds of Sete. It is protected on the north by natural ramparts of
white limestone which rise like mammoth's teeth from the rocky scrub, or
garrigues.
The Cistercians came here in 1138. An ascetic offshoot of the Benedictine
order, they picked sites for their solitude, abundant water and for soil
suitable for gardening and viticulture. (They could predict the taste of the
wine by tasting the earth.)
Diane d'Allaines inherited the 900-acre property through the counts of
Turenne on her mother's side of the family. They had acquired it in 1838,
with the consent of the bishop of Montpellier, from a M. Granier to whom the
place had been sold as a national asset after the French Revolution. Granier
used the cool church for ageing his wine: the great oak hogsheads that he
installed either side of the nave and round the apse stand there to this
day.
The present owner's privileged predicament is unusual but not unique. She
belongs to a small club of French abbey-proprietors - though the abolition
of the law of primogeniture in France has ensured that most are joint
owners.
'When I was small it seemed to me absolutely normal to live in such a
place,' she said. 'I never had the shock you have who come here for the
first time.'
Do your friends who live in ordinary houses find you different?
'No, I don't think so. If something could make me a bit old-fashioned it's
not because of the place, it is because of the education I received.' Part
of that education was at a girls' school in Surrey, where she acquired her
well-accented English.
For all her background in the landed aristocracy, it has required a certain
financial and spiritual ascetism on the part of the abbess of Valmagne (as
she jokingly calls herself) to rise to the challenge of the place.
Do you sometimes feel it a terrible weight?
'No,' she laughed. 'Sometimes I'm tired. But it's not the place, it's the
work.'
She is strong-willed and a traditionalist, but quite without hauteur. She
looks after people in trouble, and her four dogs were taken in as strays. To
me, she would only describe herself as a perfectionist who saw untidiness
everywhere.
You mean you look for cracks in the walls and litter on the ground?
'I see that, but each time I go to the cloister I think it's so beautiful -
unless I'm in a hurry or something.'
Do you feel the weight of the past?
'Of course. I am very interested in the past of the abbey. And of course St
Bernard (spiritual father of the Cistercians) has occupied a lot of my time.
I'm very much impressed by St Bernard. Well, he's been criticised for the
Second Crusade, which was a mess. But for his writing and his importance in
Europe . . .
'Very often I imagine how they built the church - the time it took, the
people, the peasants who were just fed and clothed and defended it during
the Hundred Years War. Those people worked to the glory of God, and that's
all. No money.
'And when I see the world now, how it is that everything is for money; and I
see what is going on in France at the moment - it's amazing, like Italy, all
those politicians taking money for themselves - I do compare, and say we are
living in a very mad world.'
Is it a religious impact the place has on you?
'No, not even. It's that I think the world is very ill and I wonder how long
it can continue like that.'
She contrasted the profits of the pharmaceutical companies with the poverty
of those who died because they could not afford treatment.
A door opened and the four dogs, spreadeagled on the dining room floor of
the private wing, leapt up barking. 'La paix]', shouted their mistress.
I asked her about her own budget.
'I do not spend a lot of money for myself - very, very little. I am not very
interested in money, really. Of course I used to travel in the old days. I
never go for holidays now.'
What about clothes?
'Very ordinary clothes. I try to find clothes nice but not very expensive.
Well, that and a bit of food when the children are here.'
She was referring to the three young children of Philippe her son and Ruth
his English wife who live nearby and run the vineyard.
'When my husband died, I got a little pension.'
Valmagne was still in some disrepair when Diane d'Allaines took it over from
her mother. There were buckets in the rooms to catch the rain. Fortunately,
she had the wherewithal to do something about it. She had inherited another
property, a chateau called Brinon near Orleans with an 84-metre frontage (as
long as the nave of Valmagne), two wings and 25 bedrooms.
'It was a shooting place and nowadays - poof] - you buy pheasants, you put
them in a wood and . . .' She clapped her hands to simulate gunfire.
'All we could do there was put up a luxurious hostel for shooting. That
didn't interest me. A choice had to be made between Valmagne and that place.
For me, who am quite meridionale, the choice was done.' As if to emphasise
the finality of the decision, she referred to Brinon only as 'the other
place', never by name.
The sale of Brinon enabled her to put a new roof on Valmagne, a job costing
over FFr2m (Pounds 250,000), to extend the private wing and thus to convert
a romantic relic into a going concern.
Had she not been afraid of the responsibility?
'I think I didn't see that, no. I knew it was going to be very hard, but
this place was worth it and the other was not.
The dogs were restless and she went into the kitchen to get their food. The
mongrel's bowl she placed outside the back door, the old red setter's just
inside, the little white poodle's by the stove and the bassett-hound's by
the coat-rack.
'My life is full' she said. 'It wasn't like that before. Very often I think
I've got a lot of worry . . . But I think my life is full and I think too
I've done something with my life, something which will survive. And that is
a great satisfaction for me. Otherwise, if I had stayed over there in the
other place - well, it is a very ordinary life, banal.'
Did you think of yourself as a strong person?
'I never asked myself that question, but now - Allez] Dehors]' - she shooed
the dogs out - 'I'm not so interested in me like that, you see. The thing is
that I'm pushed by events. When I was younger, very often I thought life was
difficult. I was asking myself questions. Now I do not. Life - it's hard
very often but gives me satisfaction.'
The state helps with grants and a recent measure has relieved owners of
historic monuments from death duties. Routine maintenance is covered by a
grant (currently FFr480,000 a year) and income from visitors, conferences,
wedding receptions and the like. The vineyard is quite separate, and just
about profitable. She continues to put in her own money for such capital
works as re-opening the bricked up abbey windows, three of which have just
been completed.
But the great church is buckling. Whether by mistake or to preserve the
romanesque cloister on its south side, the 13th century architects made the
flying buttresses on that side too slender.
Do you have dreams of it falling?
'No, no]' she exclaimed with horror. 'You do everything you can. After that
. . . well, after a certain point you are not responsible.'
And if it suddenly started to move . . . ?
'But don't say that. It's been like that ever since 1257. It won't move
tomorrow morning. But we must do everything in such a way that it doesn't
move in 20 years. I'm working not for me. I'm working for them . . . That's
all.'
It was not clear if she meant her heirs or the people of France.
'My feeling is not the feeling of an owner,' she continued. 'I think I'm
only a responsable. I'm one in the chain and I must transmit it. And I hope
it will stay in the family. But you see we do not know.'
If your grandchildren decided to be airline pilots instead, would you be
devastated?
'I think if they do not do what they ought to do, they do not deserve it.
You see, you must in a way deserve what you have, don't you think?
'And of course I hope one of the three - maybe the three together if they
get on - will be able to keep it. If not, well . . . ' She broke off with a
shrug.
'When you are born in a family to whom this sort of place belongs, you must
consider yourself as a responsable and not an owner. You have no rights. You
have duties. I will try and explain all that when they are older.
'They must also be thankful for all the generations before who have kept the
place and transmitted the place. And that they must never forget.'

FT  01 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: The train spotter's guide to
unification - No one can agree on a timetable or a destination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
September marked a new stage in the European debate. It is not now just
about Europe. It seemed to take a traditional turn with the publication of
the now notorious paper by the German Christian Democrats proposing a Union
based on a 'hard core' of five or six states. But there were also two
little-noticed comments by the Czech prime minister, Vaclav Klaus, which, if
taken seriously, could breathe new life into the flaccid body of British
negativism and nationalism on this subject.
In an article in The Economist, written before the CDU paper appeared, Klaus
established a simple principle of subsidiarity: 'We cannot escape
responsibility to solve our problems at home . . . Nor should we be
surprised if the forms and pace of European integration prove to be
determined by the real interests of the countries concerned and of their
citizens, rather than by artificial blueprints approved at various
inter-governmental summits.'
Klaus concluded with an analysis of the difference between European
'integration' (good) and 'unification' (bad). These views attracted less
attention than they deserved for they were overtaken by the row about a
multi-speed Europe. The CDU said someone had to set the pace and it should
be a grouping based on the Franco-German axis.
Klaus replied in the Prague daily Lidove Noviny. He said that Europe was a
'multi-speed continent, whose elements have always been strikingly different
from each other'. He was alarmed about the way things were going. There was
a growing view that 'Europe' was the basic unit, whereas in fact the nation
was, and would remain so.
If all this sounds like Lady Thatcher circa 1990, it is not surprising.
While she talked about throwing back the (economic) frontiers of the state
and not allowing Brussels to roll them forward again, the central Europeans
think in terms of their recently reclaimed political independence. Central
European nationalism is at odds with the ideology of Europe, even when that
nationalism has the civilised and utilitarian character offered by Vaclav
Klaus.
Britain should heed Klaus. He says that, when it comes to joining Europe,
'The Czech Republic will find it easier to board the slower train rather
than the 'super express'.' Why does John Major not say that? Why not follow
the advice of the Daily Telegraph: other countries should be told they are
welcome to try an economic and monetary union and Britain would watch quite
happily as the whole thing fell apart. Anyway, nothing worries
Euro-enthusiasts more than explicit moves to strengthen the unification
process. It was Le Monde which headlined its comment on the CDU paper
Rudesse germanique. It was the Italians and Spaniards who clamoured 'me too'
when the exclusive nature of the hard core was revealed.
If there is a slow train in Europe, the British will be in the driving seat,
with a fair chance of seeing the express derailed. But the British have
their own illusions which overstate the power of the nation. Listen to the
endless crowing about the departure of the UK from the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism a couple of years ago.
That governmental disaster is now credited with near-magic properties: the
consequent cut in short-term interest rates brought about a boom, the
devaluation of the currency made British exports competitive. With one
bound, the Union Jack was free. No matter that if there is a great recovery
going on, nobody outside the M25, the motorway around London, believed it.
No matter that the devaluation has not eliminated the country's trade
deficit while other nations, still un-devalued within an unofficial ERM,
suffer no such problem.
The cut in interest rates was a good thing but that is a reflection of the
exaggerated British reliance on short term loans. All that has happened is
that Britain has moved from a monetary policy dictated by the Bundesbank to
one dictated by the bond markets. What will be said when they force
unacceptably high short term rates on us?
Professor Reimut Jochimsen, a member of the council of the Bundesbank,
entered the debate when he told a conference in Oxford last month that the
nation-state had become too small to solve most problems with which it was
confronted. He concluded that a Euro-solution demanded that there ought to
be some middle way between a Brussels super-state and the nation.
So there is a new argument about Europe. Klaus welcomes the idea of many
speeds where nations can choose their own destiny and says the nation state
can solve its own problems. The Bundesbank says it cannot and wants a train
to a destination that has yet to be built. The British want there to be just
a slow track or no track, and the Euro-enthusiasts want to drag the
true-believers away from the rest to a station all of their own. A
four-track Europe.

FT  01 OCT 94 / The noble rot at a society's core: Peter Aspden, at the RA's
Venice exhibition, saw only the sad degeneration of a culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER ASPDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I guess it was just another tale of Piccadilly low-life; a succession of
fleshy floozies catching my eye everywhere I turned, while their lusty
men-folk patrolled the alley-ways looking for action. Some of them wore
masks, but I could see through their cheap disguises. They were frightened.
This was a society on the brink of collapse, and they knew it.
It was a highly disturbing couple of hours. But when I left the Royal
Academy's The Glory of Venice exhibition, the whiff of 'Chanel No. 5 crossed
with aerosol room freshener', as the catalogue describes the pervading
atmosphere, stuck in my throat: why this fascination with the 18th century?
And if this really was the Age of Reason, the ultimate expression of man's
rational mastery over the universe, why did its patrons surround themselves
with the kitsch and glitter of these ghastly artefacts?
Many speak of the joy, the sensuality, the celebration of 18th century art;
at the Royal Academy, I saw only the sad degeneration of an entire culture,
the noble rot at the core of a society intent on partying for dear life.
Were its leading lights so blinded by the pellucid skies and arcadian
visions that they failed to see the storm clouds gathering?
Some of the paintings are religious, at least in theme; but their tone
betrays them: Tiepolo's The Immaculate Conception, in which a curvaceous,
knowing Virgin immodestly acknowledges the panting leers of the surrounding
cherubs; Piazzetta's Guardian Angel, who gestures grandly above the camp
theatrics of her adoring saints. Forget spirituality; more palpable in the
exhibition is the douceur de vivre of this self-indulgent age, the air of
pleasure and luxury which permeates even the smallest works.
These mannered, stylised creations, beautifully painted though they may be,
speak of an unbridled arrogance totally devoid of sacredness or humility of
spirit, emblematic of a society utterly engrossed in its own affectations.
Little wonder that the French, having captured Venice and the famous Lion
which symbolised the city's supremacy, shipped the statue in small pieces
back to Paris where it was re-assembled with its tail lowered and placed
between its legs.
But why the fascination? Could it be that the brazen excesses of the 18th
century remind us, ever so slightly, of our own? The sharpest minds of that
period described their cultural milieu in terms we are not unfamiliar with
today: opulent, acquisitive, corrupt, philistine, insecure. It is a mistake
to assume that all intellectuals of the Enlightenment celebrated the
unqualified triumph of reason and science; did Alexander Pope not jibe at
man's role as the 'Sole judge of Truth, in endless Error hurled: The glory,
jest and riddle of the World]'?
We too live in a cynical world which glorifies sensuality and revels in the
ironic twists and turns of a post-heroic mentality; is a trip to The Glory
of Venice simply an act of mass transference by which we can guiltlessly
enjoy the corpulent delights of an era we identify with our own?
That is why I felt a little sick as I wandered round the Royal Academy,
hurrying past its dank allegorical tombs, its insipid canal views (can these
continue to have any impact in an age of mass tourism?), those oh-so-naughty
putti urinating out of the clouds, the chained Nubian slaves holding aloft
their prized pieces of porcelain. Charming as a bucket of cold custard. The
show ends with the cloying works of Canova; take a close look at the pious
plaster bas-reliefs Teaching the Ignorant and Feeding the Hungry, then go
and look at the Parthenon Marbles, and weep for what happened to Western
Civilisation.
Once out of the exhibition, however, there is no escape, for the shameless
hedonism continues in the gallery shop: carnival masks, silk scarves,
needlepoint kits, Bassano ceramics, Murano jewellery, multi-coloured pasta
and charcoal-roasted artichoke hearts. A man approaches me to explain my
chances of winning a holiday (overlooking, you guessed it, the Grand Canal)
if I buy a lottery ticket for the Royal Academy appeal.
It is all too much. I wonder which is more decadent, a society which
splashes its decline all over a piece of canvas, or one which pretends it is
not happening and keeps falling in love with its past.
The Glory of Venice: Art in the Eighteenth Century, at the Royal Academy of
Arts, London until December 14.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: A momentous 'Salome' in Leipzig - Since unification
Udo Zimmermann has given the Opera a distinctive profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years after the fall of Communism, Leipzig has emerged as east
Germany's operatic success story. Unlike numerous counterparts in west
Germany, the Leipzig Opera has not allowed financial pressure to sap morale
or artistic vitality. Seizing its new-found freedom, it has staked its claim
to an international reputation with a string of notable productions, the
latest of which is Salome.
The Leipzig Opera spent most of the Communist era out of the international
gaze. With standards that were no more than provincial, it was content to
play second fiddle to the world-renowned Gewandhaus Orchestra. German
unification brought job losses and a fall in audience  - but there has been
no navel-gazing. Thanks to dynamic leadership by the east German composer
Udo Zimmermann, the company has emerged leaner, fitter and with a keen sense
of purpose.
This has been achieved against considerable odds. The DM73m (Pounds 30m)
budget is considerably less than Dresden, and will almost certainly be cut
in the coming year. As well as a full opera and ballet programme, the
company runs a separate theatre devoted to operetta - the only German opera
house to do so. The Leipzig public is conservative and its politicians want
value for money.
That has not stopped Zimmermann taking risks. Since his arrival in 1990, the
programme has been dominated by 20th century operas and unconventional
directors. In his first two seasons, there were strong productions of
Busoni's Doktor Faust and Ligeti's Le grand macabre. For its 300th
anniversary last year, the company laid on eight weeks of ambitious
programming, including Stockhausen's Dienstag aus Licht and a staging of
Boris Godunov by the film director Istvan Szabo. Leipzig basked in the
publicity this generated.
After a pause for breath last season, the company has returned to the
offensive. Salome had a hand-picked cast of international singers, most of
them undertaking their roles for the first time. The next production is
Schoenberg's Moses und Aron, to be staged by the Hungarian-Jewish dramatist
George Tabori. The radical east German producer Peter Konwitschny will
tackle Tchaikovsky's Onegin in January, and Leipzig hosts its first Festival
of Contemporary Music Theatre next March. Zimmermann is now negotiating with
Covent Garden to co-produce Henze's Das verratene Meer.
Without losing sight of bread-and-butter repertoire, Zimmermann wants to
give Leipzig a distinctive profile. He says the most successful opera houses
are not necessarily those with the biggest budget. 'You can't make sensible
judgments by comparing DM73m here with DM110m there. What counts is the
amount of fantasy and innovation you see on stage. We want to show that in
art, as in business, Leipzig is a city which is open to the world - that we
are catering for a European public as well as the local taxpayer.'
Salome had an incontrovertible grandeur - the kind of performance that
generates an enthralling momentum and transforms one's view of a work. It
had the advantage of the Gewandhaus Orchestra in full cry, and a conductor -
Jiri Kout - who was in complete command of the score and of the forces in
front of him. Rarely does one hear so many unforced instrumental subtleties
combined with such an effortless surge of sound, all placed at the service
of the stage drama.
Nikolaus Lehnhoff updated the story to the present - but unlike so many
other German producers who adopt the same technique, he offered fresh
insights, while preserving the opera's fundamental dramatic relationships.
Here was a decadent ruling order in the process of collapse - a timeless
portrait with clear echoes of our own late-20th century world. The action
unfolded in the backyard of a concrete palace. Herod, his family and
courtiers wore chic evening dress. Jochanaan was a long-haired preacher,
guarded by a half-naked muscle-man who doubled as the angel of death. The
designs by Hans-Martin Scholder and Jorge Jara included a few kitschy
details, but each character was skilfully drawn, and the climactic moments
were targeted with bull's-eye accuracy.
The Danish soprano Inga Nielsen was an unexpectedly strong Salome. The voice
may not be big, but it has a pure timbre and ample penetration. Her pacing
was immaculate - the final soliloquy was a tour de force - and she built the
Dance of the Seven Veils into a powerful crescendo, whipping Herod with
jewels before stripping as she withdrew. With short, sleeked-back hair and
an imperious manner that spoke volumes, Anja Silja made an unforgettable
Herodias, while Jacque Trussel's suave Herod was a refreshing change from
the usual character-tenor caricature. As Jochanaan, Falk Struckmann
confirmed his status as Germany's leading younger-generation bass-baritone.
Christopher Ventris's Narraboth and Annette Markert's Page - not to mention
a brilliant quintet of Jews - were a tribute to the quality of the home
ensemble.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: The flame of modernism still burns in St Ives -
William Packer admires the work of Patrick Heron and Terry Frost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The far western tip of Cornwall in the 1950s was deemed to be the very
epicentre of English modernism, with Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth the
presiding geniuses and, around them, any number of bright young things, a
true community of painters and sculptors of all kinds. Well, art history
never comes quite so simple and pat as that. While it was true that artists
were there and active in numbers enough to constitute a distinctive school,
there were so many more elsewhere, and no less significant and
distinguished. And of course the moment passed. The school of St Ives, such
as it was as a major force in British art, dispersed: some of the artists
moved away, some died, and the little town soon resumed its status as an
artists' colony of the quainter sort.
But one or two artists remained to keep the flame of modernism alive.
Barbara Hepworth stayed on until her death in 1975, and there, on their
respective hilltops to the north and south, two of the principal and truly
representative artists of the school still are - Patrick Heron at Eagle's
Nest, high above Zennor to the west of St Ives: Terry Frost on his hill
above Newlyn, looking out over the bay to Saint Michael's Mount. By
coincidence they both have exhibitions concurrent in London - Frost, indeed,
has several.
The new works by Heron constitute a remarkable testament to his continuing
vigour as a painter at 74, for they were all done this year and some are
extremely big. And to see them shown to such advantage in Camden's large and
splendid galleries is to have borne in on one the force of the old truth,
that all abstract painting is a kind of landscape. In this, Heron indeed
consciously echoes le bourgeois gentilhomme himself, in declaring at last
that he has been a landscape painter all the time. This, from an artist as
committed as any in his time to the painterly purism of the colour, field
and the integrity of the surface, one of the first to reduce his work to
terms of the simplest gestural stripe, is a nice twist. And we can see what
he means.
For from his Eagle's Nest he looks down on the world as upon a map, alike to
the nearer world of the garden with its borders, beds and terraces, and
further to the ancient patchwork and tracery of the Iron-Age fields and
hedges far below, and the sea beyond. Suddenly the familiar eccentric curves
and filled-in blobs and blocks of his later work take on extra and
unsuspected meaning and resonance. But now the filling-in has gone, and the
colour shifted from the spread mass of paint to the actual line, and a line
that is now febrile, edgy, nervous. Close-up we see only the stuff of the
paint and the mark and stroke of the brush: stand back, and we discover
again the spidery, taut drawing of Heron's work of more than 40 years ago,
before abstraction. Thus the circle of a true career completes itself.
Terry Frost, by contrast, makes the same connection, but by open
demonstration rather than by implication, showing the new and the old
together. And he has always openly admitted, indeed celebrated, the
initiating stimulus of the visible world, whatever his apparent commitment
to abstraction.
He too over the years - he is now 79 - has developed his own vocabulary of
image and symbol, a personal heraldry of sun and moon, crescent and spiral,
registered ever more clearly in unmoderated reds and blacks, blues and
yellows. To see his newest work beside that of the 1950s and early 60s, is
to be reminded both of the sources of its imagery, and of its evolutionary
nature.
For though the colour was more muted and earthy then, the colours, as it
were, of that whiff of fish and seaweed that catches the throat at the
quay-side, there still are the bright boats rocking in the harbour or
beached higgledy-piggledy as the tide goes out, the seaweed on the sea wall,
and the cables running out across the sand. But such things are not
described in any documentary sense, but rather hinted at, teased out of the
imagination by inference and oblique suggestion, conjured out of simple
shapes set in rhythmical conjuction. It is good to see such impressive work
again, after so long.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Song and celebration at the Wigmore - Hvorostovsky,
Gritton and the Vogler Quartet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has been a busy week at the Wigmore Hall, fulfilling for the listener,
not without complications for the management. Dmitry Hvorostovsky stepped in
to save Tuesday's recital when the American diva June Anderson cancelled her
eagerly anticipated appearance - in the process breaking the tyrany of IMG
Artists whose singers were to have dominated the whole of the Wigmore's
International Festival of Song.
The young Russian baritone, no stranger to London, was impressive. His
special achievement was to maintain interest in a programme predominantly
dark and melancholy (only one song in the entire evening, Rakhmaninov's
'Spring Waters', was at all uplifting). Hvorostovsky is the definition of a
'soulful' Russian singer, with dark, burnished tone, beefy top notes and a
strong lower register. His voice is spread so seamlessly that his
performances can lack variety, but here he found the measure of each song in
his all-Rakhmaninov first half, right from the lilting lines of the opening
'You, my field'. The pianist Mikhail Arkadiev proved an equal partner in
songs like the intimate 'How fair this spot', in which voice and piano are
evenly integrated.
After interval, the mood got progressively darker, through two of
Shostakovich's Spanish Songs and the 'Fragment' from his Four Monologues, to
a dramatic account of Mussorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death. Hvorostovsky
has sung them widely, in concert and on CD, and his interpretation has
deepened: slow, deliberate tempos underlined the nightmarish 'Lullaby', and
he found the malevolence in 'Trepak' before concluding with a terrifyingly
intense 'Commander-in-Chief'. As a generous - though not very idiomatic -
gesture, he switched in his encore to English for Purcell's 'Music for a
While'.
On Thursday it was the turn of the young British soprano Susan Gritton,
winner of this year's Kathleen Ferrier Competition, here giving the London
recital that is part of the prize. Her programme - Mozart, Schubert,
Strauss, Britten, Falla and the premiere of two songs by Roderick Williams
(b. 1965) - revealed a useful versatility: in her opening Mozart concert
aria ('Voi avete un cor fedele', K. 217), Gritton's sound was bright and
interesting, and her voice grew as the evening progressed. She caught the
intimacy of her Schubert selection (helped by Eugene Asti's crystal clear
accompaniments), and found the lustre demanded by her Strauss group: 'Ruhe,
meine Seele' was perhaps the highlight of the evening.
Words are not Gritton's strength. In her German songs there were
distracting, over-exaggerated consonants, and even WH Auden's lines in On
this Island came across intermittently. The soprano caught the mood of
Britten's 'Nocturne', but the 1930s idiom of 'As it is, plenty' eluded her.
Roderick Williams's Two Songs to Cope (Wendy Cope settings) were effective
in their way - Gritton was playful in 'Reading Scheme' - but his music would
not have challenged the 'Hecklers'. Gritton coloured Falla's Seven Spanish
Folksongs well.
The previous evening brought Michael Collins as soloist in 'The Romantic
Clarinet', the second concert in the Wigmore Hall's Celebration of the
Clarinet, a series devised by Collins himself. We heard two works central to
the instrument's 19th-century repertory, Clarinet Quintets by Weber and
Brahms. Weber's was written for Heinrich Baermann, the leading clarinettist
of his day, and the programme also acknowledged him by including his Adagio.
Collins, joined by the Vogler Quartet and the double bassist Mary Scully,
poured out a stream of marvellously even, melting tone.
The Weber gave full rein to Collins's expressive powers, and also scope for
buoyant humour. The work is like a chamber concerto, and rapport between
clarinet and the 'orchestra' of four strings was excellent; this was music
making of the highest order. The Brahms, in which all five players caught
the lyricism of the Adagio and the transparency of the sublime Andantino,
gave the evening a warm, autumnal glow.
The Celebration of the Clarinet continues at the Wigmore Hall.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Nostalgia with panache - Antony Thorncroft reviews
'Only the Lonely'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Big O is not some nameless horror (oh, perhaps it is) but the pseudonym
of Roy Orbison, who made a career out of proving that life copied art.
Orbison sang melancholic ballads about loneliness and loss, and sang them
even more fervently when tragic accidents wiped out first his wife and then
two of his children. A career slump did not make him laugh much either.
But such traumas provide an ideal centrepiece for yet another rock-biog
musical. We start, naturally, at Orbison's funeral - he died of a heart
attack aged 52 - and are soon into one of those 'why, oh, why' scenarios,
with son Wesley asking Roy's best friend 'what sort of man was daddy?', and
hanging around 2 1/2 hours for the answer.
Actually Orbison was a very simple man. He had an amazing voice, described
once as sounding like 'the slow fall of tear drops', and minimal
personality. On stage he hid behind dark glasses - a wise move since he
looked like a Halloween pumpkin with the worst haircut in the world - and
never spoke to his audience. So naturally Bill Kenwright's much worked-over
production concentrates on the songs, all 40 of them.
The songs are great, from the inevitable 'Only the Lonely' to the unlikely
'Born to Run' (Springsteen was a great Orbison fan), and they are
enthusiastically performed by one of those bands of fine musicians who go to
pieces when asked to play cameo acting roles.
Still, it hardly matters with Larry Branson as Orbison. Branson is a
Canadian who has built a career as a Roy Orbison lookalike. The resemblance
is uncanny, and the voice is not bad either, fine for the low notes and the
vibrato, a bit rough in the upper reaches.
Of course just before his death Orbison had been re-discovered and was
working with Bob Dylan, a suitably tragic finale. Rock musicals always
follow identikit plots of mercenary managers, abandoned wives, marriage to
one night stands, and the inevitable circles of success, failure, success.
Only the Lonely is as good an example as any, and will please the middle
aged with fond memories and the young who like a good weep. Orbison was
always popular in the UK and, in his easy going way, he did not take umbrage
when on his first headliner tour he was given the Beatles as his supporting
group; he proved putty in the hands of Brian Epstein, who switched the
billing.
Such is the stuff of modern drama. Catherine Porter is suitably anguished as
wife Claudette, who inspired a big Orbison hit and whom he married twice.
Among the welter of quick impressions from the multi-parted cast, Anne Smith
was a notable Dusty Springfield. There is little insight, or subtlety, in
the show but it delivers nostalgia with an agreeable panache.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Dreams, demons and a rare talent to disturb - Annalena
McAfee talks to Ian McEwan about his first book for children
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNALENA MCAFEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Incest, bestiality, cross-dressing, murder and dismemberment are not the
traditional stuff of children's literature. But when novelist Ian McEwan
turns his attentions to younger readers, speculation is inevitable. One
newspaper has already referred to 'a sex scene' in The Daydreamer, McEwan's
new collection of short stories for children. This scene, it transpires,
describes a single, imagined, and entirely non-incestuous, kiss.
'You see the problem of my reputation,' says McEwan, whose early
preoccupation with extremes of human behaviour once earned him the
soubriquet Ian Macabre. 'I suppose it's my own fault,' he says wryly. 'I'm
sure The Daydreamer will get poured into the mould somehow.'
This reputation as the elegant chronicler of polymorphous perversity has its
positive aspect. Since his collection of short stories First Love, Last
Rites was published nearly 20 years ago, attracting critical acclaim and
revulsion in equal measure, he has consolidated his position as one of
Britain's most original and successful writers of fiction - novels and
screenplays - and acquired the concomitant trappings, including homes in
Oxford and France.
The down-side includes incessant requests from Hollywood for scripts about
serial killers. 'Their sheep-like imagination angers me. They all want to do
the same thing. All the plots involve the systematic wiping out of
attractive young women. It's so easy to do on screen.'
Hollywood is still a sore point after the debacle over The Good Son, in
which his original script about a psychotic child was 'put through the
mincing machine' following the interventions of Macaulay Culkin's father.
'It's a terrible film. Don't ever go and see it,' he says, before recalling
that it was banned in Britain following the Jamie Bulger murder case.
McEwan's decision to embark on his first children's book marks, in a sense,
a return to basics. 'I had wanted to write short stories again for some
time. This was a way of tricking myself into it.' Although The Daydreamer
(Cape Pounds 8.99, 96 pages) is his first work for children, childhood has
been a constant theme in his novels, from The Cement Garden, a tender story
of forbidden sibling love and unlawful burial, to Black Dogs, an exploration
of the conflict between science and soul, in which the orphaned narrator
states that looking after children is a way of looking after yourself.
The protagonist of The Child in Time, devastated by the abduction of his own
child, is a writer who finds that, by some accident, his first novel is
humiliatingly categorised as children's literature. McEwan enjoys the irony.
'Yes, he earned so much money with his book that he generated an enormous
tax bill which made it inevitable that his second book was for children. I
was wondering if I was about to just become a children's book writer. But I
think I've escaped that fate by coming to it late.'
The Daydreamer represents the fulfilment of a promise to his 11-year old
stepdaughter Alice, who had asked him to write some of the stories he had
made up for her on holiday. The stories have had a lengthy gestation - Alice
is now 22 - and went through several changes and refinements in the
re-telling to his other step-daughter Polly, now 24, and his sons William,
11, and Gregory, 8. 'I inscribed Alice's copy saying 'sorry it's late'. She
said she was perfectly pleased to have it at any time.'
The collection is also a celebration of the imagination, of waking dreams,
'that thing teachers are always telling you off about but is a vital part of
everyone's inner noise.' The theme of the book is transformation and
exchange and the mood is in turns elegiac, disturbing (though, pace
Hollywood, no more so than many favourite fairy tales) and subversively
funny.
Peter, the central character, swaps places with the family cat; subsequently
becomes a baby for a day (featuring cross-dressing, though transgenerational
rather than gender); erases his tiresome family limb by limb (dismemberment,
albeit bloodless); and is set upon by a pack of disaffected dolls (more
dismemberment, pictured right). The language is spare but finely wrought and
every story, accompanied by Anthony Browne's delicately menacing black and
white illustrations, has the haunting quality of a classic.
'I don't want to sound pompous,' says McEwan. 'But I think it is a crucial
part of one's sanity to imagine things other than they are. The ability to
imagine yourself as someone else must be at least part of the basis of
morality. Behind cruelty must lie a failure of the imagination, of empathy.'
The switch of focus from adults was not difficult. 'My impression of
conversations with my children is that there is nothing you can't talk to
children about, short of VAT and income tax returns. There are clearly
disturbing things I wouldn't want to discuss with them, but they would
certainly be horribly interested.'
He cites the success of Roald Dahl's gleeful misanthropy as evidence of
children's fascination with the proscribed and the nasty. 'Everyone else was
writing stories encouraging children to have correct attitudes, especially
in the Seventies. A lot of children's books were shockingly condescending
and didactic - improving books encouraging the right attitudes about gender
and race. The attitudes themselves were fine but if novelists want to push
values then I think they should write moral tracts.'
McEwan also defends the derided Enid Blyton, whose stories enlivened his own
childhood, and who incurred the contempt of the orthodox moralists of the
Seventies. 'They were all marvellously ridiculous stories. Each summer
holiday a gang of kids would disrupt an international conspiracy of villains
with dogs, picnics and ginger beer.'
Anything that gets children reading, he maintains, is worthwhile. 'When I
see my children excited by a book it's a real high: that crossover moment
when children don't move their lips when they read and they're seeing
something unfolding in their head. Planes could be crashing, heroes could be
macheting their way through jungles, but all there is is silence and the
sound of turning pages. That's the moment when a child has a private life.'
McEwan does not, however, subscribe to the dewy-eyed view that childhood is
an Eden from which we are all brutally expelled. In The Daydreamer's final
story, Peter, on holiday with his family, has the grim realisation that one
day he must leave the group that runs wild on the beach and join the group
that simply sits and talks. Overnight he becomes an adult, has that first
kiss and, later reverting to boyhood, comes to realise that there are
adventures ahead after all.
'I wanted to show that being an adult can be fun too,' says McEwan. VAT,
income tax returns and the limited imaginations of Hollywood producers
notwithstanding.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Anarchy versus German romanticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The South Bank has a multi-art 'Deutsche Romantik' festival in train now,
ambitious but so broadly focused as to risk losing the bird-in-hand. It
began on Thursday with a London Philharmonic concert: Beethoven's Fifth and
Wagner's Wesendonk Lieder, very proper choices, but also Hans Werner Henze's
Heliogabalus Imperator (from 1972, revised in 1986).
The best excuse for that was that it prompted an introductory speech by
Henze himself, who compressed an intelligent, soulfully Left-biased
diagnosis of German romanticism into some ten minutes. GR (or DR, if you
prefer) was a matter of reclaiming German folksong and its artless native
ways; of revelling in the German Landschaft, in Weber's hunting-horns and
simple, singable airs, and in Schubert's discovery of naive young millers
and their maids. What came later, Henze told us, was tragically adulterated
by ideology and nationalist propaganda.
Wagner's name was never actually mentioned, nor the fact that subsequent
musical developments came from Austrian composers rather than German ones.
By implication, Henze's own Heliogabalus must have been meant as a
celebration of the 'true' Romantic tradition - sexual liberation and happy
anarchy, as it turns out, with no political intent whatsoever. One might
mistrust that. Henze's gloire et misere have always been indissoluble from
his extreme sensitivity to popular (student) political phases.
Anarchical liberalism was fine for Woodstock, but it soured with Kent State,
Altamont and the dull fate of Sid Vicious. Heliogabalus reaches back to an
imagined hedonist past: the 15-year-old boy-Emperor makes his sumptuously
exotic entrance, as reported by the ancient scribes, initiates three years
of comprehensive polysexual debauchery (mostly on ravished, sighing strings)
and is then brutally assassinated by the Praetorian Guard. That was not the
kind of thing that Schubert or Weber had in mind.
As a musical construction, Henze's Heliogabalus struck me this time as
indefatigably colourful but thinly stretched. There are ritual post-echoes
of his 1965 Auden opera The Bassarids - not of its androgynous hero
Dionysus, but of the deadly ritual itself - at the start and finish. In
between, with a spate of instrumental solos (for the young Emperor's newly
appointed senators: 'children of love, rough-hewn but hearty') Heliogabalus
tries on a variety of just-post-'60s dress: silky Messiaenic tone-clusters
for the strings, birdcalls and learned two- or three-note effects from solo
winds, some improvisation, some frank theatrics. It lacks any persuasive
through-put. Fun, but not much cop.
Franz Welser-Most conducted Henze with self-effacing flair. His Beethoven 5
was disconcertingly swift, without any of the time-honoured rhetorical
pauses, but coolly alert and vital. For the five Wesendonk-Lieder, of which
Wagner orchestrated only 'Traume', he recreated some plausible Wagnerianism.
The soprano Amanda Roocroft found her expressive way into these songs rather
well, without convincing me that they require anything less than the grand,
steady depths that a fine mezzo can command.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Arts: Camus on revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is an excellent idea to revive The Just by Albert Camus in the mid-1990s
 -the kind that one might have hoped would have arisen in the Royal National
Theatre.
The play is based on the abortive attempt at Russian revolution in 1905 when
the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovitch was assassinated. Yet, written in the
late 1940s, it is really about the debate within the French left: how far
should you go in supporting Stalinism (or any party), right or wrong? How
far should you stick to revolutionary violence if you believe that the
ultimate end is benign? And, if you have to assassinate children along with
the Grand Duke, for how long do you believe that the end justifies the
means?
Those are old questions. They do not necessarily become less interesting
with the collapse of communism. As this production at the Camden Studio
Theatre is clever enough not to stress overtly, there was quite a lot of
Stalinism, and violence for its own sake, in the IRA.
So The Just is both a period piece, historically fascinating, and still just
about topical. The trouble is that Camus, for all his intellect, was not
much of a playwright. He thought, as was the French fashion of the time,
that the theatre could be used to debate ideas without taking much account
of character, feeling, plot or variety. The Just has the touch of a seminar
on moral philosophy.
Yet it is a better piece than I remembered. Occasionally - when, for
example, we are waiting to hear whether a shooting takes place - there is
drama. And the ideas under discussion can hardly be dismissed as trivial. A
relatively young audience at the Camden Studio seemed to find them riveting.
It is also always possible to make an unexpected character come to life. The
example here is Skouratov, the chief of police, played by Eldridge Adolfo. I
doubt if even Camus, who was clearly a subtle man, would have seen him as
the most enigmatic figure in the piece. But that is how he is: a civilised
man trying to preserve order in an unstable state. An unusual amount of
sympathy also goes to the Archduke's family: Camus was a bit more radical
than that.
Some of this interpretation may be put down to the acting. Those who play
the old order are better performers than those who seek to launch the
revolution. Still perhaps that, too, is deliberate: we are all conservatives
now.
This revival is directed by Kate Schaffer as part of Grande Designe Theatre
Company. It is a reminder to more established theatres that there are old
texts worth looking at.

THE OXBRIDGE CONSPIRACY
by Walter Ellis
Michael Joseph
Pounds 15.99, 340 pages
There is nothing inherently wrong with elites. Every country has them: in
some, they are an asset; in others, a distinct drawback.
Successful elites in the modern world tend to be open to meritocracy, drawn
from a reasonably broad spectrum of society, dedicated to wider goals than
just their own privilege and social status, educated and experienced in what
makes a dynamic market economy tick. America's movers and shakers come
closest to this ideal, as do the elites of post-war Germany and Japan, to
varying degrees.
At the other extreme are those elites which remain closed and narrowly
drawn, usually from a few wealthy families, hostile to free-market democracy
which would challenge their entrenched privilege, dedicated to exploiting
the masses whom they treat with contempt, rather than empowering or
enriching them. The kleptocracy of Haiti provides a contemporary example of
this sort of elite.
The British Establishment falls somewhere between the American and Haitian
extremes: less broadly based, meritocratic or successful than its American
counterpart, more so than the Haitian one.
Increased social mobility has made the British elite more open to
meritocratic advance than it was 100 or even 50 years ago. What is
remarkable, as Walter Ellis's book reveals, is just how much of an Oxbridge
preserve it remains. Even I was surprised by the grip - in some cases the
stranglehold - Oxbridge continues to have on the levers of power. Ellis
shows that in the traditional areas - politics, the law, the civil service,
the City and religion - Oxbridge graduates remain predominant in the top
positions.
The power of Oxbridge to place its people in plum posts has eroded a bit in
some areas; but on present trends Oxbridge graduates will still dominate
this nation 100 years from now.
Ellis also shows, more startlingly, that even in less traditional areas,
such as the media and popular entertainment, Oxbridge also enjoys a
preeminence. The BBC and the broadsheets are Oxbridge bastions. Ellis is
kind enough to write that as editor of The Sunday Times I have employed
journalists 'of every background and none.' But even the only other
broadsheet, daily or Sunday, edited by a non-Oxbridge man, The Independent
on Sunday, is dominated by Oxbridge types. Senior editors at the Telegraph
newspapers and the Financial Times are also almost overwhelmingly Oxford or
Cambridge men.
Snooty Oxbridge has now infiltrated even popular culture. British comedy in
the Morecambe and Wise era used to have strong roots in the working class.
Since Monty Python days it has gradually been taken over by Oxbridge: the
wave of 'alternative' comedians of the 1980s who have now become mainstream
'luvvies' is largely Oxbridge. Even our literature has been colonised.
Shakespeare, Dickens, Eliot, Scott, Austin, the Brontes - they all owed
nothing to Oxbridge. But today's literary mafia is an Oxbridge
near-monopoly.
Apologists for Oxbridge, and they are already mustering to savage this book,
will argue that none of this matters: Oxbridge graduates are simply the best
and the brightest ('I don't see why 2 per cent shouldn't translate into 90
per cent,' says one Cambridge woman. 'Employers are looking for the top
people of a generation, and they go to Oxford and Cambridge'); and, in any
case, both universities are now part of the meritocracy - almost 50 per cent
of their intake is from state schools. Both arguments are bogus.
It is part of the insufferable pomposity and arrogance of so many Oxbridge
types that its graduates dominate the pinnacles of power simply because they
are the best. I have never found this to be the case. I never cared which
university staff at The Sunday Times went to, and usually did not know.
When, often in casual conversation, I learned their alma mater, it was
rarely the case that the best had been to Oxbridge.
As Ellis argues, many of Britain's best and brightest do not apply for
Oxbridge in the first place, often because they think that socially they
would not fit in. As a result the competition to get into other universities
is often greater than it is to get into Oxbridge: at modest Nottingham, for
example, there are six applicants for each place; the Oxbridge average is
just three.
What Oxbridge provides, however, is access, in the manner of a
self-perpetuating oligarchy - the universities are, as Ellis puts it, 'the
marshalling yard for the gravy train.' At The Economist, the
Oxbridge-educated senior editors would regularly ask Oxbridge authors to
send on their brightest students. High-flyers from Manchester or Leeds had
no such privileged path. It is a special treatment for Oxbridge graduates
that exists right across the British Establishment.
The idea that the two ancient universities are part of meritocratic Britain
is mere sophistry, at which Oxbridge folk excel. If 50 per cent of the
intake is now from state schools, it means that over 50 per cent still comes
from private schools which educate just 7 per cent of our children. They may
be among the most privileged and best-educated; it does not follow they are
innately the brightest. Moreover, as Ellis points out, even those from the
state sector come overwhelmingly from the remaining grammar schools and
shire comprehensives, themselves predominantly middle class. The way we
waste the talents of those from less privileged backgrounds while
overpromoting the mediocre from the middle classes is one of the disgraces
of modern Britain; in that regard, Oxbridge is part of the problem, not the
solution.
Ellis has written a brave book that needed to be written, though in places
it is rambling and repetitive and the research often seems skin-deep. It is
also weak on analysing the confluence of class and culture that has kept
Oxbridge predominant. For that, Professor Weiner's English Culture and the
Decline of the Industrial Spirit remains the best text. The hegemony of the
two universities would not matter if Britain was a great success story in
the 20th century. But Oxbridge imparts to our elite values which, in their
anti-commerce, anti-technology, anti-market snobbery, make them unfit to run
a modern economy. It is the Oxbridge elite which has presided over the
decline of this nation, and it lacks the ability or the temperament to
reverse it. As Ellis writes: 'Britain under Oxbridge is a failed
experiment.'

IRELAND AND THE IRISH: PORTRAIT OF A CHANGING SOCIETY
by John Ardagh
Hamish Hamilton
Pounds 20, 446 pages
The dinner party had been a fairly tame affair. As the Irish evening light
faded, topics would momentarily flare into life then, like rainbows,
evaporate as sentences were left unfinished and mouths were delicately
wiped.
But then someone mentioned De Valera. A small, elderly gentleman, whose only
contribution to the evening had been a hearty burp over the soup, sprang to
life.
'De Valera was a cantankerous, humourless old bollocks,' he said, his pudgy
little legs kicking the air. 'The worst thing to have happened to this
miserable little country since Cromwell. That man (here he brandished his
fish knife, sending a piece of turbot au beurre flying through the
candlesticks) set Ireland back 200 years.'
Things were not the same again. Tempers flared. Manners were forgotten as
the civil war was replayed across the dinner table. Fresh drinks were
petulantly called for.
By the time coffee and liqueurs were served in the lounge - 'Make mine a
large one: none of your Protestant meanness here,' shouted one guest to his
landowning, but very Catholic, host - it was a verbal free for all. Dark
personal secrets were revealed. A bottom or two was pinched. A large lady
walking unsteadily to the lavatory almost garotted herself on a Victorian
umbrella stand, collapsing in a heap of suspenders and stretched velvet.
There is nothing the Irish like more than talking - particularly about
themselves. It amounts to a national disease. Whole summer schools are
devoted to the subject - hour after hour, year after year. The conclusions
are inconclusive.
The Irish are charming, difficult, spontaneous, unreliable, creative and
knavish. They are Europeans, but not really. They are certainly nothing to
do with the English - though it is grudgingly admitted that there are more
of us over there than over here. In short, the Irish are unique - in their
own sort of way.
John Ardagh is charmed by the Irish. He has put together a highly readable
account of the way Ireland is changing and how it is, a trifle self
consciously, coming to terms with the modern world. Ardagh's energy cannot
be doubted. He crisscrossed the country talking to scores of people from
various shades of society. His list of thanks and acknowledgements reads
like a Who's Who of modern Ireland.
But somehow Ardagh is too kind. He makes the Englishman's mistake of
believing too much of what the Irish tell him.
Ardagh finds a great wealth of talent in Ireland. That is true. But Ardagh
is too fond of littering his text with gushing adjectives. At least one
person is described as astonishing, others are marvellous. Several people or
their books and newspaper columns are brilliant.
Ardagh admits to being pleasantly surprised by Northern Ireland. Its people,
he finds, generally have more about them than the more easy going
southerners. But again he cannot resist a bit of hyperbole. 'The people are
marvellous, second to none.'
Mary Robinson, the president, is one of the brilliant ones. 'A creaking
political system - but a fine new woman President' is the irritating sub
heading in one chapter. President Robinson is doubtless one of the best
things to have happened to modern Ireland.
But as Ardagh points out, she might have influence but she has no power in a
country where political talent - in contrast to the cultural or academic
spheres - is very thin on the ground. As is hinted at, Ireland has been a
badly run country.
The sleeve note on his book describes Ardagh as 'a strong believer in the
battered old idea of European union.' There is no doubt that EU membership
has brought great advantages to Ireland. It has widened cultural horizons,
raised incomes, particularly of the farmers, and done away with some of the
old dependence on Britain.
But EU membership has introduced a new kind of dependence. Irish politicians
gleefully talk about 'the take' from Brussels. EU membership has only
delayed the painful adjustment of Irish agriculture to the modern market
economy. In spite of the Irish diaspora spread round the world, Ireland
itself remains an insular society, hardly part of the European mainstream.
Ardagh does explode many of the old myths about Ireland by focusing on
society as it is and not, as tourism promoters would have it, as some kitsch
theme park full of Yeats and leprechauns. In the midst of all the interviews
it is a pity that Ardagh does not pause for a bit more fun. When he does it
illuminates what at times is a somewhat repetitive journal.
Ardagh describes meeting Garech Browne, part of the Guinness clan and an
eccentric even by Irish standards. 'Garech is married to an Indian princess
who is sometimes around. He was asleep when I arrived as agreed at 7pm, but
eventually he woke up and remembered who I was . . .'
Garech is founder of one of Ireland's most successful recording companies
but had no record player in the house. Ardagh relates how Garech takes him
out to sit in his old Mercedes where, 'shivering under the starry March
night, we listened to cassettes of glorious Irish folk music on its radio. I
went home very happy.'

ALL'S FAIR: LOVE, WAR AND RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
by Mary Matalin and James Carville, with Peter Knobler
Hutchinson
Pounds 19.99, 493 pages
Gore Vidal still has the wonderful knack of hitting the nail on the head.
All's Fair, he wrote in the New York Times, 'is a him-and-her comedy worthy
of early Hepburn and Tracy.' The only question, with that incomparable film
couple no longer available, is who gets to play Mary and James; his
suggestion - and not a bad one - is Susan Sarandon and John Malkovich.
Even by political standards, it might be a messy movie to make, because of
its lack of good and bad guys, happy or sad endings and clear-cut plot lines
(nothing could be that clear in 1992 with Ross Perot jumping up and down
every other month). But Mary Matalin and James Carville, with the assistance
of very professional writing help, have managed to produce a book mostly
about the 1992 presidential campaign and somewhat about their own love
affair that satisfies political junkies without ever becoming maudlin or
excessively self-congratulatory.
She is the Chicago native of Croatian descent, who converts to conservatism
early and rises steadily in the Republican party political apparatus to the
position of political director and deputy campaign chief for George Bush.
She has a temper and a tongue and is now, naturally, a TV talk show host.
He is the 'ragin' Cajun' from Carville, Louisiana, sometime drop-out,
sometime Marine and sometime lawyer who had managed many more losing
campaigns than he had won until Pennsylvania, 1991, when he directed his
Senate candidate from a 47 point deficit to a ten point win over a very well
known Republican former governor. That brought him to Bill Clinton's
attention and, eventually, to the position of manager of the Democratic
presidential campaign. He has a temper and a tongue and is much in demand on
the talking head circuit, when not advising Clinton and too many other
candidates to mention.
Naturally they fell in love, sustained it throughout the campaign, mostly by
rarely seeing each other but talking almost every night, and were married
last year. She is a visceral Republican, he a dyed-in-the wool Democrat, she
was emotional about Bush and he about Bill and Hillary and both freely
confess to loathing the other's party. James writes, charitably, 'I always
say I want the people I'm running against to catch the clap and die.'
The personal likes and dislikes of both - more in her case than his - keep
the book going. Mary's admiration for Lee Atwater, the 1988 Republican
attack dog strategist who died of a brain tumour in 1991, is absolute, as is
her contempt for John Sununu, former New Hampshire Governor and Bush's White
House chief of staff until the end of 1991 ('the political acumen of a
doorknob.')
Both are contemptuous of the press operating as a pack, regardless of their
fondness for individual hacks. James says it takes the assembled heavies
three minutes after an event to decide what is 'the story . . . once the
collective mind is made up it will not change . . . history gets created in
three minutes; don't miss it; if you get there late, you're dead.' He is not
wrong, and not only in the US.
Working in the thick of a presidential campaign is mostly mechanical, often
off-the-cuff, and leavened, or sullied, by reactive dirty work. Mary is
delighted when finally the Bushies take aim below Clinton's belt, to which
she adds with a series of vicious attack faxes to the media, for which she
is unrepentant. James is generally more forgiving. After all, it was his
slogan - 'it's the economy, stupid' - that in the end made Clinton
president, and he is still a political consultant.
The confection of the book, alternating monologues, sometimes
faux-conversations, arranged roughly chronologically, works better than it
sounds. There may have been - and will be - more profound books on the 1992
campaign, but this has an honest ring. No more so than when James writes 'so
little of this stuff is contrived and so much accidental. So little of it is
Machiavellian and so much is actually human.' And it produces a president.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Books: Catch-22 in apocalyptic mode - Fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES

<TEXT>
CLOSING TIME
by Joseph Heller
Simon &amp; Schuster
Pounds 14.99,
464 pages
Closing Time starts like Catch-22: Yossarian is in hospital, flirting with
his nurse and thinking about death. ''We can't find anything wrong,' they
told him. 'Keep looking,' he instructed. 'You're in perfect health.' 'Just
wait,' he advised.' The difference is that Yossarian is now an old man
suffering from 'late-life depression'.
So is this the same Joseph Heller whose first novel, 33 years ago, gave a
catch-phrase to the world? Heller must know the question well. ''You sound
so bitter these days'', a friend says to Yossarian. ''You used to be
funnier.''
True, this is a bitter novel, and not so 'funny' as Catch-22, nor, I think,
is it intended to be. Much has been made of Closing Time being the 'sequel'
to that first, best-selling masterpiece, but the point should not be
over-stated. Yossarian, the Armenian bombardier with a healthy fear of being
killed, is 68, still has sex on his mind, and is contemplating a third
marriage. Milo Minderbinder, the mess officer who takes capitalism to
extremes, has prospered beyond all dreams and, with his son M2, is
developing an invisible, super-Stealth bomber. The Chaplain is discovered in
old age to be passing heavy water and to have tritium in his flatulence:
Milo says, 'We will patent the chaplain as soon as we find how he works, and
we are looking for a trademark. We are thinking of a halo . . .'
But be warned that there is no return for Major Major, Colonel Cargill,
General Dreedle or Doc Daneeka. Instead there are two Jewish friends from
Coney Island, Sammy Singer and Lew Rabinowitch; Noodles Cook, the hopeless
publicist who goes to work in the White House; an all-knowing private eye;
assorted wives and nurses; and Little Prick, the US President, whose passion
for video games eventually brings the world to an end.
There is much re-visiting - and re-working - of the wartime episodes of
Catch-22, and, for today, lurid descriptions of the nightmare squalor of
1990s New York. It is a sprawling, scarcely coherent jumble of a book,
bursting with ambition and imagination. Parts of it are excellent.
By far the best chapters have to do with Sammy and Lew. Sammy Singer, who
had only a tiny part in Catch-22, is widowed, melancholy, plucky, an
early-retired copywriter: 'I never thought I'd be this old, wake with stiff
joints, and have nothing really to occupy myself with most days but my
volunteer fund-raising work for cancer relief.' Lew Rabinowitz, an entirely
new creation, is an ex-infantryman who is dying  - again, brave and jesting
 -of Hodgkin's Disease ('I'm sick of feeling nauseous'). In these two
characters, and especially in their memories of their Coney Island boyhood,
Heller has returned to his own roots and has rarely seemed better.
The problem comes when he switches into apocalyptic mode, as Yossarian
observes the preparations for a grotesque society wedding in, of all places,
the Port Authority Bus Terminal. This leads him down into a Dante-esque
Underworld, a Hell where he meets up with the dead and chooses to escape,
only to emerge into nuclear holocaust. Heller has attempted nothing so bold,
and fails, because, in contrast with the sustained comic satire of Catch-22,
in Closing Time he lurches between realism and surrealism with only the
certainty of ever-closer death, for individuals as well as for our world, to
hold them together. 'I'm well into my sixties and we're into the nineties,
and this time I'm beginning to feel . . . that this time things are
beginning to come to an end.'
Incidentally, we are told what happened at the ending of Catch-22. After the
Chaplain, at Nately's funeral, saw the vision of a naked angel in a tree,
Yossarian (who was in the tree) ran away from the war; he was caught, sent
home, and promoted to Major because the Air Force didn't want a fuss. ''I
didn't get far. I couldn't even get to Rome'. 'You didn't escape there? In a
little yellow raft?' 'That happens only in the movies . . .' '

FT  01 OCT 94 / Property: Time-share sheds its old, shabby image - The
British account for 38 per cent of Europeans who part-own a holiday home.
Suddenly, the industry has real prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps it is the thought of exchanging the British winter for a flat in the
sun that makes the idea of owning - or part-owning - a holiday home in a
warmer country so attractive. Or it could simply be an extension of the
great British desire to own property, wherever it might be.
Whatever the explanation, British buyers make up 38 per cent of Europe's
764,000 time-share owners. With the recession apparently easing and the
acceptable face of the industry gaining public confidence, there is reason
to believe it can achieve steady growth.
Time-share buyers do not own property but have the right to use part of a
villa or flat, usually on holiday, for a fixed number of weeks. The idea of
having your own little place in the sun - or perhaps at a winter ski resort
 -becomes even more attractive when the prospective investor gets the
advantage of such things as special air fares and discounts on stop-over
hotels, excursions and rental cars.
Joining one of the established time-share exchange networks, such as Resort
Condominiums International (RCI) or Interval International, can give an
investor even greater flexibility.
Time-share certainly has become better organised, more respectable and more
accepted in the 20 years since the concept was imported from the US. But the
Time-share Council, the body set up by the industry to act as its regulator,
has some cautions.
'Time-share should always be regarded as an investment in holidays, not
property,' says council chairman Norman Burden, who owns two time-shares, in
Torquay, Devon, and Tenerife, in the Canary Islands. 'Once you have bought
your time-share - it can cost anything from Pounds 2,000 upwards - you
should write off the cost mentally and not think of re-selling it for at
least five years.'
There are several reasons for this. One is that the price of the product
bought new is high in relation to the true cost of the building: a developer
might sell time in one of his properties at anything up to five or six times
the cost of building and equipping it.
The value of a time-share could fall by up to 40 per cent or more as soon as
it is bought because much of the initial price goes towards paying the
developer's marketing costs. Indeed, many time-shares in large complexes
remain unsold for months or even years, thus depressing the re-sale price.
In general, despite European economic recovery, supply still exceeds demand.
Re-sale can be a problem for people who have owned time-shares for a long
time. Raymond Bass, a retired executive from Pangbourne, Berkshire, bought
Pounds 15,000 of time-share 15 years ago and has enjoyed many successful
holidays with his family. But now that he and his wife want to sell, they
cannot get their money back, mainly because of the depression in property
prices generally over recent years. 'I shall be lucky to get Pounds 5,000
for my time-share weeks,' says Bass.
In any case, as Burden points out, it would be unwise to bank on a good
price for a second-hand time-share - or even finding a buyer at all - in the
first five or so years.
Bass does not criticise the time-share concept as such. 'We have enjoyed
several dozen holidays in time-share apartments or villas in places as
diverse as California, South Carolina, several locations in Spain and
Portugal, and also in this country,' he says. 'Often, these were in
self-contained complexes that provided us with infinitely superior
facilities to those we might have enjoyed on a package holiday.' Bass,
however, was critical of some big time-share developers  - among them,
several large UK companies - which, he claimed, failed to allow for
refurbishment in their advance budgeting.
One other positive aspect of time-share is the informal networking between
friends and time-share enthusiasts that takes place. Just as you might let
your son, daughter or neighbour have a week or more in your time-share
apartment, so you could equally extend this to a cousin, aged aunt or
business colleague. Informal arrangements of this sort are inevitably
cheaper to arrange than doing it through an established agency.
For those who wish to know more, the Department of Trade and Industry has
produced a useful booklet called Your Place in the Sun. This can be obtained
free by calling 071-215 3344.
The Time-share Council, set up in 1990, can provide details of resort
builders and operators as far apart as Scotland and Spain, the Lake District
and Louisiana. It also supplies details of agencies specialising in
time-share exchanges. The address is 23 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6LB
(tel: 071-821 8845).

YOLANDE BARNES, head of Savills' Residential Research, crops up constantly
in conversation for her startlingly bullish forecast last December that
house prices would rise across the country by 19 per cent in 1994, and by 25
per cent in prime central London.
This year, she has been splitting her time between west London and the
United States. From a lower ground-floor flat in Notting Hill (the
Kensington end), bought presciently in April 1992 when prices were at their
lowest, she has been spending alternate fortnights in Philadelphia, where
her husband works as a molecular biologist.
There, she carries on her research about the UK market from the 19th century
stone house they rent in Chestnut Hill, a smart area on the north side of
the city. While she is away, someone stays in the London flat to deter
burglars and squatters.
All this, of course, leaves 'no time for a cottage in the country. We go to
other people's, or get out in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.'
WILLIAM GETHING, who, with Charles Ellingworth, founded buying agent
Property Vision, says: 'I have bought some of the most beautiful houses in
England but I do not aspire to live in one myself. There is no nicer way to
spend money, but I know what a drain they are.'
Gething was married in 1991 and lives with his wife in a 'pretty,
flat-fronted, 1840s-1850s worker's cottage' in Brook Green, west London: a
typical and 'modest' piece of the London landscape - and only 10 minutes'
walk to work. Before that, he was in Holland Park, where he could also walk
to work.
For eight years, too, he has been renting a farmhouse on the
Dorset-Wiltshire border; it is part of an estate he bought for a US client.
The house was semi-derelict but the landlord restored it.
'It is a lovely part of the world, head and shoulders above an awful lot of
the south of England,' says Gething.
JOHN HUNTER founded Northacre, a high-quality developer, in 1988 with
architect Klaus Nilsson (after time in the army and with Savills in Sloane
Street, west London). They began by converting what flats and houses they
could find before moving on to 9 Tregunter Road, SW10, which the Thai
government bought last year for its ambassador; and Observatory Gardens, W8,
now in its last stages with 32 of its 62 units sold. The next project is to
work on Earls Terrace, W8, the first terrace built in Kensington
(1811-1815).
'We are very proud of selling everything within six months of finishing it,'
says Hunter. 'And our bankers like that. During the recession, quality has
been the key to selling.' Northacre's in-house architectural side makes
business far easier, too. 'We pass drawings around and decide.'
Hunter has just bought an end-of-terrace house on Clapham Common. Before
that, he rented in Wandsworth for nine months (intending to be there six)
after selling a mews in Kensington. 'We have moved five times in the past
three years. It is the problem of being married to a property developer.'
The house had been derelict for 10 years; the previous owners had been using
it for bed-sits. He had to pay a premium price for its position but 'it was
easy for me to assess how much work needed doing'. Most of all, he likes
overlooking the open land of the common: 'It is better than looking over
gardens.' Then again, as someone who grew up in Glasgow and took holidays in
the Highlands, he is looking at an old shooting lodge beside a loch which he
hopes his wife and two young sons will like enough to share with him.
TONY PIDGLEY, co-founder (in 1976) and managing director of the Berkeley
Group, is renowned in the property world for selling the firm's land stock
when prices peaked in 1989, and buying plots again in the trough. The firm
builds new homes in small developments under the Berkeley, Crosby and St
George names. Many cost more than Pounds 400,000.
Pidgley's own home is in a small village with a pub near Henley,
Oxfordshire. He bought the old manor house, which was re-built in 1936 after
a fire, for its 'views and tranquillity' - and its 14 acres. Recently, he
has added a conservatory, which includes an oak floor scrapped by the
British Museum.
Pidgley has just sold a London flat in Lowndes Square SW1. In Spain,
meanwhile, he has had a holiday home for many years at Puente Romano,
outside Marbella on the Costa del Sol. 'My wife loves it,' he says.
BILL YATES has been senior partner of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley for 2 1/2 years
and in the firm for 30 years. Born in Wiltshire and christened in Salisbury
cathedral, he regards himself as a 'moonraker' (a native of Wiltshire) and
has a Queen Anne farmhouse in the beautiful Vale of Pewsey. 'We drew up a
specification 15 years ago. It had to have enough rooms for five boys, be
convenient for London by motorway and near a station, be in a village, and
have a cottage with it.'
Its chief asset, however, could be the garden. Yates and his wife, a family
court magistrate in London, are serious gardeners. 'The owners two before us
had two full-time gardeners, who did annuals and vegetables. The ones before
us grassed over the borders; we put them back in different places.'
Their London house is in Pimlico. His wife bought the lease in 1965 and they
acquired the freehold from the Grosvenor Estate in 1979. 'We are lucky
there, too. We have got a garden.' Yates notes that, provided things are
kept where they are needed, 'it is a complete pleasure living in two
houses'.

Antarctica fires Nicholas Woodsworth's imagination

<TEXT>
0748 hrs: arrive Cuverville Is. Position: Latitude 64 degs 41 mins South /
Longitude 62 degs. 37 mins West. Weather: Cloudy, 985 millibars. Temp: 2.50
air, - 0.50 sea. Wind: SW 4-5, sea calm.
Vessel drifting off NE of Cuverville Is. Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3
humpback whales.
There is no getting around it - Peter Skog, chief officer and keeper of the
Explorer's log, will never be a Conrad. Is it his Swedish phlegm and
unflappability? Is this the new marine minimalism of the 1990s? Or is there
simply not enough space to wax lyrical in each entry? One way or another,
Chief Officer Skog's prose style fails to do full justice to the Antarctic.
Here we are, 75 fully-grown adults, all dressed identically in wellies and
bright red parkas, full of hot breakfast and ready to go - as excited as
six-year-olds on a school outing. And how does the chief officer record the
moment? He makes a landing on a penguin-teeming, whale-surrounded,
ice-berg-jammed antarctic island sound as thrilling as stepping off the No
38 bus on to the Edgware Road. Each time I wander up to the bridge to peek
at the log a new literary disappointment awaits me.
One dreads to think what calamity it would take to move him to passionate
language - a giant tidal wave or a biblical parting of the waters might just
do the trick.
Rough sea and heavy swell, vessel pitching and rolling he wrote in the log
two days ago as we crossed the notorious Drake Passage from Cape Horn to the
Antarctic Peninsula. Good Heavens, in my cabin pitching and rolling was the
least of it - all night long shoes, books, cameras, sets of drawers and
anything else left unsecured whizzed back and forth between cabin door and
porthole like things possessed. Not even the toilet paper was left in peace
 -somehow an entire roll managed to unwind itself on to the floor in my
cabin bathroom.
Next morning, still in the heaving Passage, the dining room looked like the
charge of the Light Brigade. Others may praise Drake, Magellan and Darwin,
all, admittedly, fine sailors of these fearful southern seas. But I praise
Alex, our Filipino waiter, who with a loaded tray can make his way from a
crashing galley across a bucketing floor to a pitching table, all without
spilling a drop.
But will Skog record that in the log? No. Neither will he note that Alex is
one of the few people on earth to have had his appendix removed in an
emergency operation at an antarctic research station. Nor that he never
forgets the Tabasco sauce. Are these not all exceptional feats deserving of
record? In my honour roll of antarctic heroes, Alex stands somewhere near
the top.
Sea temperature -0.50 Skog has written in his passionless, dry-as-dust
Nordic hand. Where does he mention that just yesterday some of the more
adventurous souls aboard the Explorer, my own brave self included, went
swimming in these frigid antarctic waters? Granted, it was Skog, and not I,
who knew the secret of volcanic Pendulum Cove and its sand beach,
geo-thermally heated from below. But where does he describe the great
steaming and billowing, sloshing and wallowing that followed our landing?
Skog might not be impressed, but I was. Pendulum Cove gave me a better bath
than I can get from my miserable little hot water geyser in London.
Gentoo penguins, fur seals and 3 humpback whales, writes Skog, as if
compiling a shopping list for Sainsbury's supermarket. But I can tell you
that meeting these creatures face to face has nothing to do with buying
pesto sauce or coffee beans.
In the first place, pesto and coffee smell good; colonies of antarctic birds
and mammals do not. Conrad himself would have trouble with the smell of a
penguin colony - it is indescribable, but can knock you over at 50 yards.
Guano aside, though, penguins have great attraction - they are cute and
cuddly, curious and comic, and in their nesting thousands, wholly
fascinating. In their black and white outfits they look much like French
waiters, but are far more approachable.
Seals are even more impressive - their smell can knock you over at 200
yards. And in some ways they are even more like humans than penguins - a
contented, smelly and sociable herd of one-tonne elephant seal bachelors
lying together in a steaming sea-side wallow puts me in mind of a post-match
rugby-team locker room. And what about those cocky, argumentative,
testosterone-driven male fur seals who spend much of their time vying for
the favour of the females? Wind, waves, ice and water aside, I might be in
my favourite local on a busy Saturday night.
But like most passengers on the Explorer, I reserve my greatest interest for
the whales. Skog can write 3 humpback whales and let it go at that if he
likes. When you are in a Zodiac inflatable dingy and close enough to be
drenched in the fine spray from a whale's blow-hole it is rather a different
matter. There is nothing quite like the company of these vast animals as
they lazily dive and spout and roll and wave their flippers and raise their
flukes. Melville wrote hundreds of pages about the great drama between men
and whales; you would think the miserable Skog might manage more than three
words. But no.
1145 hrs: arrive Neumeyer Channel. Position: a spectacular channel, narrow
and high sided, grander than any northern fjord. Weather: marvellous -
crystal clear air, gloriously sunny, fresh and bracing - the kind of weather
that makes you feel happy to be alive. Sea: full of blue curacao-coloured
icebergs.
Vessel crunching through jig-saw puzzle pack ice, surrounded by snow-covered
mountains plunging steeply to the sea.
Could Skog be be responsible for such a loose and fanciful entry? Of course
not. Skog wrote nothing at this point. I have written it for him. The chief
officer, apparently, does not believe breathtaking beauty worthy of
recording. But while he enjoys measuring millibars, the rest of us enjoyed
gazing out from the upper deck at some of the most astounding scenery we
have ever seen - great ice cliffs, impossibly tall and pointed peaks,
glaciers flowing at infinitesimal speed into the sea, weirdly sculpted
icebergs, seals basking on sun-washed ice-floes.
We were all impressed, and this is saying something, for the passengers
aboards the Explorer - wealthy, well-travelled, and for the most part
American - have high expectations. For my own part, I had no idea that such
a continent existed - in my mind Antarctica was a bleak, desolate and
lifeless place of little interest. On the contrary, it is now for me a place
of the greatest interest.
1500 hrs: arrive Port Lockroy. Position: Lat: 64 degs 52 mins S / Long: 6252
W. Weather: partly cloudy, 982 millibars. Temp. 50 air, 00 sea. Sea calm.
Vessel drifting off Port Lockroy. Gentoo penguins, leopard seals.
Back to dull Skog's ditch-water delivery again. Does he never tire? Has he
never stood on the rocks, surrounded by hundreds of clamorsome, roosting
shags, and looked down into the waters of Port Lockroy as I did?
How striking it is to watch penguins, slapstick, waddling, inept birds on
land, transform themselves into marvels of dynamic design in the water. With
just one hop from a rock they become agile, graceful creatures, as fast as
torpedoes as they flash about in search of the fish and shrimp-like krill
that is their prey.
One moment of marine game-watching in Port Lockroy remains with me: that
instant when, on a drifting ice-floe not five yards distant, a snoozing
leopard seal awoke and yawned, showing me a great mouthful of needle-sharp
teeth, then slipped silently into the water. There is nothing furry or cute
about leopard seals - they can flay a penguin right out of its skin with a
few tosses of their powerful heads. The moment that seal slid below the
surface, the hunters became the hunted.
But does Skog appreciate the thrill of the wild, the vitality of life, the
inevitability of sudden death? Gentoo penguins, leopard seals is all he can
find to write. But then Swedes have always been a squeamish lot when it
comes to high drama. In their country I have seen dairy cows with rubber
bulbs fitted to their horns in order that they cause no undue harm or
excitement. Poor Skog, perhaps he should not be blamed.
2000 hrs: arrive Paradise Bay. Position: Lat: 65 degs 42 mins S / Long: 6252
W. Weather: overcast, 984 millibars. Temp: 0.50 air, 00 water.
Vessel drifting off Paradise Bay. BBQ, then Zodiac tours, landing on the
Antarctic continent.
All is forgiven] In that last sentence taken from the log today I detect a
tiny soupcon, the merest hint of understanding, of what it is to be Man the
Explorer. But it is enough. Until now, the fourth of 10 days of cruising, we
have only visited islands lying off the coast of Antarctica. This evening we
land on the continent itself, and Skog has recognised the heroic symbolism
of that act. A literary milestone.
If there is any doubt as to the significance of the event, there is, as the
chief officer notes, to be a magnificent outdoor meal served on the rear
deck, with a penguin - even now being chiselled in ice by a skilled Filipino
chef - as the centrepiece to our blithe, mulled-wine-swilling company.
And if that is not enough, the captain is up on the bridge at this moment
preparing a Certificate of Antarctic Exploration for each of us. We have
'joined the ranks of Scott and Shackleton', it informs us, 'and ventured to
set foot on Antarctica, the biggest, coldest, driest, windiest, loneliest,
most remote and least-known continent on earth'. Not only that, but we are
now dedicated to 'honour the brave pioneer Antarctic explorers who sailed
these frozen seas before us, and to protect the Antarctic Continent for
those who will follow'.
That is certainly quite a big mouthful for one small step, even if it is on
to Antarctica. No matter how much the chief officer has loosened up, I am
sure he would not approve of the tone of such a document - could that be why
he has left the captain alone on the bridge and is down here with us
munching BBQ? It is simply not his style.
Nicholas Woodsworth sailed to Antarctica with Abercrombie and Kent, Sloane
Square House, Holbein Place, London SW1, tel 071-730 9600. A+K's 10-12 day
Antarctic cruises, combining visits to the Falklands and / or South Georgia,
begin at Pounds 3,996, inclusive of return air fare from London. He flew to
Santiago, originating point of the expedition, with British Airways.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport: Around the world in 80 Tests - The problems of the
weary West Indies team / Cricket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The West Indies cricket team will leave the Caribbean for India in a few
days, starting a global trek which will only halt, at least temporarily, in
England at the end of the summer. By then the team will have had four tours,
one of which will be at home, and will have played 15 test matches, and
between 25 and 30 one-dayers, depending on how successful they are.
Such a hectic schedule is unprecedented in modern cricket, and comes after a
full English season for most of the leading players, which followed a home
series against England. After India, the West Indies will go to New Zealand,
hurry back home to meet Australia, and then travel to England for six tests
in the summer. It is hardly surprising that the West Indies are without four
stars for the tour of India. They risk playing the rest of the squad into
the ground over the next year.
There are many reasons for so much cricket. The West Indies are a drawing
card. Names such as Brian Lara and Curtly Ambrose guarantee good crowds. And
good crowds warm the hearts of cricket administrators, and fill the meagre
coffers of some boards, not least that of the West Indies. The financial
viability of home tours is uncertain because of the relatively small grounds
and small crowds in the Caribbean.
West Indian players apparently do not mind. Money for cricketers,
particularly for good ones on consistently winning teams, is significant.
'A cricketer's earning life is relatively short, ending in the middle 30s if
one is lucky,' says Alan Rae, who opened for the West Indies in the 1940s
and early 1950s, and who is now a lawyer in Jamaica. 'So they have to secure
a firm financial base to ensure a good standard of living to look after
their progeny in their old age.'
There are, however, obvious dangers to making so many runs while the sun
shines. It is already telling on the West Indies who go to India, and
perhaps to New Zealand, without several of their most experienced players.
For the second time in nine months, Richie Richardson, the captain, has been
forced to rest because of fatigue.
Also missing will be Desmond Haynes, an opening batsman. Ambrose, who is
having an operation for a shoulder injury, which could well be the result of
too much cricket, and Winston Benjamin, another fast bowler, who is being
disciplined following an off-the-field incident in Antigua during the final
test of the England tour.
India's bowlers may regard Brian Lara with more than passing concern, but
batsmen such as Sachin Tendulkar, Vinod Kambli and Mohammad Azharuddin may
see the inexperienced bowling support for Courtney Walsh as a chance to
improve their averages.
In spite of the West Indies' record and seeming invincibility (they have not
lost a test series since they were beaten by New Zealand in 1980), it will
be difficult for a weakened and tired team to defeat India, one of the
better test teams, away.
'India will definitely have to consider themselves favourites,' says Michael
Holding, the former West Indies pace bowler. 'Without Ambrose, the West
Indies bowling attack cannot consistently destroy the Indian batting. I do
not see any West Indies bowler who is going to give the Indian batsmen
sleepless nights.'
The combination which could defeat the West Indies in the next few months -
too much cricket, lassitude, a weakened team and improving opposition -
could also threaten the team's earning power. The West Indies are attractive
only as long as they are winning.
'There is an obvious danger to the players' health from such a hectic
schedule as the one the West Indies are undertaking,' says Rae. 'The players
can also lose their edge from too much cricket.' Could he have withstood
such rigours? 'Certainly not. I went through this at a slower pace and I
could never have played county cricket for more than two or three years.'

FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport in the US: Three strikes, you're all out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, a glorious major league baseball season ended prematurely when a
strike by players closed the game down after they failed to agree with the
owners on how to divide the sport's billion-dollar revenues.
Now, a similar dispute over revenue-sharing between ice hockey players and
the management of the National Hockey League is about to lead to the
postponement of this weekend's opening of the 1994-95 season. Barring a
last-minute reprieve, the season that was supposed to cement ice hockey's
position as the fastest-growing and most fashionable sport in America will
be put on temporary hold.
To lose one professional sport to a labour dispute may be regarded as a
misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness. But what if three were
lost? There is a possibility - a slim one, admittedly - that the coming
basketball season may be disrupted by the failure of the players and the
league to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement. The players'
union and owners have already tangled in the courts over pay and other
issues, and the dispute could yet culminate in a lockout.
If the National Basketball Association season were interrupted before the
year's end, the only professional team sport left would be American
football. But even in the National Football League, all is not well. Both
players and team bosses are struggling to come to terms with life under the
NFL's new salary cap - the league-wide ceiling on team pay that the players'
union and management accepted for the first time this year.
In order to keep team pay within the cap, clubs have been forced to jettison
veterans or cut their salaries dramatically, and put their faith in a
larger-than-usual number of untested young players. This has made a lot of
players and team managers unhappy. Many now wish they had never agreed to
the salary cap.
What is so frustrating for the fans, is that baseball, football, basketball
and ice hockey are all extraordinarily successful sports. The players are
paid hundreds of thousands, or millions, of dollars, the owners earn vast
sums from television contracts, attendance and merchandising, and the
individual franchises - the clubs - are each valued at anything between
Dollars 50m and Dollars 200m.
Yet, it is the very financial success of American sports that is at the root
of the problems.
The country's four biggest team sports have become huge cash-generating
businesses. Exact figures on earnings are not available (primarily because
the owners want to keep the players in the dark), but according to Financial
World magazine, baseball last year generated annual revenues of
approximately Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.07bn), football Dollars 1.5bn,
basketball Dollars 1bn, and ice hockey Dollars 680m.
These totals are considerably understated, because they do not include
earnings from the sale of sports merchandise, which is controlled by the
leagues. Clothing and hats bearing team logos and colours are so popular in
America and overseas that revenues from merchandising range from Dollars
800m in ice hockey to Dollars 2.5bn in football.
All of this would be great news for everyone, if only the players and owners
could agree on how to share the booty. There is a single issue at the heart
of the labour-management disputes in baseball, ice hockey, basketball and
football: how best to divide the spoils. More specifically: although
revenues in each sport have been rising steadily since the early 1980s,
player salaries have been rising even faster, and the owners, who have
fuelled the rise with their eagerness to pay ever increasing amounts to star
players, want to put a stop to it. To limit the rise in salaries and keep
more of the revenues for themselves, the owners in each sport have either
imposed, or are seeking to impose, a salary cap on the teams.
The players, naturally, do not like the idea of accepting a limit on what
they earn. In those sports where a cap is demanded by the owners (baseball
and ice hockey), the players refuse to accept it - hence the strike and the
lockout. In those sports with a cap (football and basketball), the players
want to get rid of it - hence all the unhappiness and potential unrest.
There is another factor behind the dire labour relations in American sports:
the changing natures of players and owners.
Today's sports stars are different from the heroes of the past: they are
much better-paid; they are less loyal to any one team; they are advised by a
legion of agents, lawyers and accountants; and they are members of stronger
unions. Players want their share of the spoils, and are willing to fight for
it.
The owners have changed greatly over the years, too. Today, they are likely
to have fewer ties to the local community, be less respectful of tradition
and more interested in making a profit. They are also less willing to share
the revenues among each other for 'the good of the game', and more willing
to stand up to the players.
The result is more confrontation, and less compromise.
Finding common ground between the two sides will not be easy. Some of the
country's best minds have struggled with the issues that crippled the
baseball season, but no one has come up with a remedy. The commissioner of
ice hockey is a clever, level-headed lawyer, yet he is ready to close down
the sport just when it is on the verge of winning over a new generation of
fans.
Instead the owners and players will direct their highly-developed
competitive instincts to beating each other, even if they risk losing
everything else in the process.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport: Autumn days in the McCormack empire - Derek Lawrenson
greets the start of IMG season in Europe / Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK LAWRENSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few people sit on the fence when Mark McCormack and his company, the
International Management Group, are the subject. In Arnold Palmer's
biography, written by Larry Guest, the author headlined the chapter dealing
with lMG: 'Darth McCormack and the Evil Empire'.
The European tour, by contrast, swoons at the sight of the man. If it is
autumn, it must be time for Mark McCormack month. Last week we had the
IMG-promoted Lancome Trophy. This week it is the IMG-run German Masters.
Over the next fortnight, the Dunhill Cup at St Andrews and the World
Matchplay championship at Wentworth take place. McCormack devised these
tournaments. He promotes them and commentates on them for the BBC. The
players he manages will be there. During the Dunhill Cup he will chair a
committee on the Sony World Ranking, which he devised and has run since it
began nine years ago. The ranking is backed by the game's ruling body, the
Royal and Ancient, which allows McCormack to handle the television rights
for The Open. Is there any area of the professional game outside his reach?
Not if there is the potential to make money. He has enormous influence over
both the R &amp; A and the European tour. There is no questioning his position
as the most influential man in golf.
His genius lay first in recognising, and then exploiting, Palmer's
charismatic appeal.
In doing so he changed golf from a sport with limited appeal to one that
attracted support from all walks of life. Furthermore, McCormack was not an
insular American. The key word in IMG was always international. Gary
Player's signature gave IMG access to the South African market and Tony
Jacklin's gave an entry into Britain. When the European tour opened for
business, McCormack was offering tournaments, sponsors, back-up, the works.
McCormack did a lot for golf in the 30 years after he teamed up with Palmer
at the start of the 1960s. (He was also heavily involved in tennis, but that
is another story.) No one indeed, did more. But can the same be said today?
There are many who believe his empire is now hurting the game. Certainly,
with such power, there is the potential for doing so.
The Sony Ranking, for example, is run by the same company whose job it is to
promote some of the top players and who gain contract endorsements on the
strength of them being in the top 10.
And in the World Matchplay championship, Severiano Ballesteros, the most
popular player in Europe but non-IMG, did not receive an invitation until
one of the original invitees dropped out. At the same time, Brad Faxon,
winless this year but an IMG man, and John Daly, 76th in the world rankings
but a player IMG would desperately like to promote, were both on the
original list.
IMG promotes 10 events in Europe, offering the tournament sponsors such top
players as Nick Faldo, Colin Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer, whom it
manages. It then claims appearance money on behalf of its clients and takes
the percentage which it is entitled to from all their tournament earnings,
whether IMG-sponsored or not.
IMG vehemently denies that its players' schedules show a bias towards IMG
events. Discounting The Open and the tour's flagship event, the Volvo PGA
Championship, Faldo has played in just one non-IMG tournament in Europe this
year.
It was McCormack who came up with the idea of defacing every tee at the Open
with sponsors' billboards. It was McCormack who asked so much for Open
television rights that Swedish television refused to pay, and so viewers
there missed Jesper Parnevik's brave stab at winning the sport's blue riband
event.
There is evidence that the players are growing tired of IMG. Two years ago
Greg Norman left, his new manager, Frank Williams, said the Australian was
tired of 'hidden agendas: you know, IMG making deals like we'll give you
Greg if you give us TV rights'.
This year, Nick Price left, making it two Open champions in a row. The good
young players are also steering clear. Ernie Els, Jose-Maria Olazabal and
Phil Mickelson all chose other management groups.
Many are put off by the terms (IMG takes 10 per cent of prize money and 25
per cent of endorsements). Faxon is McCormack's leading US player, a far cry
from the early days when he had both Palmer and Jack Nicklaus. No wonder he
is assiduously courting Daly.
McCormack, uncharacteristically, found himself on the back foot this summer,
trying to counter reports concerning the decline of his American fortunes.
He revealed that he had had offers from Rupert Murdoch and Phil Knight, the
owner of the Nike sports company, for IMG, but said there had been no
serious discussions.
In Europe, however, he remains omnipotent, and talk of a crisis is surely
fanciful. He will enjoy the next fortnight as his British tournaments take
centre stage and, it has to be said, there will be no shortage of spectators
who will enjoy them as well.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Sport: Umpires under siege in La Rochelle - Keith Wheatley
describes the squall that has disturbed the match-racing world championships
/ Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On-the-water umpiring has been a vital part of sailing's progress into a
modern, readily comprehensible sport. From America's Cup to the Olympics,
the sight of inflatable chase boats pursuing competing yachts and referees
dispensing instant justice has become a familiar sight.
La Rochelle, venue for this week's world championship of match-race sailing,
has now witnessed the logical next stage of that evolution: abuse of the
umpires and the subsequent banning of a leading competitor. It is an
uncomfortable new era for a sport that still has an intimate and Corinthian
feel to it.
Chris Law is the British helmsman who broke through the last taboo. After
shouting criticism at an umpire who gave him four penalties in one race, he
was summoned before a panel of the International Jury and, according to its
published finding, continued his tirade during the hearing. The verdict was
'gross breach of good sportsmanship' and disqualification from the regatta.
Law, who has already won two prestigious events, the Congressional Cup and
the Royal Lymington Cup, this season, is hurt but largely unrepentant.
However, he is sufficiently disillusioned with match-racing to announce his
retirement from a sport where he was ranked sixth in the world.
'I obviously have an explosive McEnroe-type approach but none of it is
malicious or personal,' he explained in hurt tones the morning after his
expulsion. 'In 20 years of competition I don't think I've deliberately done
anything with those motives.
'The sport needs personalities, it needs characters. My evocative,
passionate way of sailing a boat has been described as exciting often
enough.'
Nemesis came in a match against Bertrand Pace, towards the end of the dual
round-robin part of the regatta. It was extraordinarily close, with the
boats only feet apart. This was more remarkable since Law had already
collected and executed two penalty turns before the short race was
half-over. According to the official report, when the umpire's flag went up
to give him a third penalty Law shouted abuse at the official.
That in turn led to a fourth penalty, whereupon Law turned to the boat
carrying the chief umpire and shouted: 'You lot are wrecking the sport.'
This was almost certainly his undoing. The whole concept of on-the-water
umpiring is both new and tough to organise. Providing a chase boat (with
driver) plus umpires for each pair of yachts in a match-race regatta is
expensive and difficult. Even ex-sailors who are accustomed to sitting on
protest committees find instant judgments on-the-water hard to make. Many
international level sailors would agree that often decisions are hasty and
wrong.
'The standard of umpiring is not high at all. It does not come close to what
is required,' said Law, who readily admits to a technique of pushing the
arcane rules of match-racing to their limit. Where he differs from his peers
is being unwilling or unable to accept the rub of the green.
'I have a problem with authority that I don't respect. It got me into
trouble at school and it's certainly got me into trouble here,' admitted
Law, whose sailing career has had more than its share of setbacks.
The final irony is while he was in La Rochelle, Law received an invitation
from the Sydney 95 campaign for the 1995 America's Cup to try out as
helmsman on their yacht. The Cup has appointed as its chief umpire for the
four months of racing off San Diego one John Doerr, the same official in
charge this week at La Rochelle.
The first challenger races for the America's Cup are less than four months
away and it has provided a distinct sub-plot to events at the championship
at La Rochelle. Each of the four semi-finalists - Rod Davis, Paul Cayard,
Bertrand Pace and Peter Gilmour - has both a role with a leading Cup
challenger and experience of the event going back many years.
'There is a definite advantage going to these events with a crew that you
are already sailing with regularly and at a high level,' said Cayard. 'There
is also an extra motivation among the skippers. You are trying to establish
a psychological pecking order that you will take back with you to San
Diego.'
Cayard's precise role next year is still uncertain. He recently parted
company with the French team after financial disagreements. Cayard, who has
dual French and American nationality, also has an offer to race aboard Stars
&amp; Stripes with Dennis Conner.
'I've also had approaches from the TV companies,' he said. 'It would
probably make me more money than sailing on someone else's boat. But once
you've been in there, it's hard to stay out of the Cup.'
In 1992 Cayard was skipper of the Il Moro campaign, headed and financed by
Raul Gardini, the late Italian industrialist.
Rod Davis is the skipper who has come out of La Rochelle looking strongest.
Rocket Rod has 15 wins out of 18 starts in the round-robin series and looked
untouchable. His crew, including three-times laser world champion Glenn
Bourke, are all senior members of the One Australia campaign to take the
America's Cup back Down Under.
Davis is the ultimate mobile professional among professional sailors. He was
born in San Diego and raced as skipper for the US in the 1987 America's Cup,
for New Zealand in the 1992 event, and now Australia. Conner christened him
'yachting's Benedict Arnold', but Davis is too relaxed about virtually
everything to mind too much.
Having been undefeated during the first day of the regatta here, Davis was
asked how he explained three losses on the second. 'I predicted that no one
would go through undefeated,' he explained. 'We just decided to take our
beatings now, rather than on finals' day.'

FT  01 OCT 94 / Motoring: Flying start for dynamic duo - On test, a new
Range Rover and Jaguar's latest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those fortunate motorists allowed by their employers (or accountants) to
drive cars in the luxury class, it has been quite a week.
First, a new Range Rover to replace the 24-year-old classic that began life
as a dual-purpose vehicle for farmers and is now put forward as an
alternative to a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, BMW 7-Series or a Jaguar. Second, a
new Jaguar XJ series - perhaps the last of a line that the late William
Lyons, who founded the company, could himself have styled.
The new Range Rover is recognisably descended from the original. But it is
more rounded, has bigger windows, a gigantic boot - the spare wheel now
lives under the floor - and standard air suspension, giving it four ride
heights. It can lower itself to make entry and access easier, squat just a
little for motorway cruising, come up a bit for minor roads and crossing
fields, and go higher still for extreme off-road use.
On the highway, it rides and handles better than any other on/off-road
vehicle, with heavy beam axles back and front. And it is incredibly agile
over really rough country - although only a handful of people buying this
mobile drawing room will ever discover that.
Engines are four-litre and 4.6-litre versions of Rover's own everlasting V8,
plus a 2.5-litre, BMW-sourced, turbo-charged and inter-cooled diesel. With
the petrol V8s, automatic transmission is standard. The five-speed manual
diesel - for me, the best all-rounder, with an up-to-28 miles per gallon
(10.8l / 100km) consumption - will be joined by a two-pedal diesel version
next summer.
Only short road mileages could be driven in the Range Rovers at their launch
in south-east England, so the experience served only as a taste of things to
come. But I learnt enough to be convinced that if you feel you must have a
4x4 as a road car, and your company can afford to pay between Pounds 31,950
for the 4.0 V8 and Pounds 43,950 for a fully-loaded 4.6 HSE, then this is
the one to have because it is the best.
Taking part in the launch of the Jaguar XJ series was a motoring
enthusiast's idea of heaven. There were four new luxury cars to drive as
hard as one's conscience (and wandering sheep) allowed in the wide open
spaces of the Scottish Highlands. (But not on the dangerous A9, dotted with
warnings of speed cameras and unmarked police cars.)
First, the XJR - a Pounds 45,450 super-charged, 326 horsepower four-litre
with massive pulling power at low speeds and a real flyer for the
businessman who feels he is not yet old enough to have a Daimler V12. It
offers super-car muscle with refinement, ease of driving, and seemingly
limitless grip from the massively wide 45-series Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres.
The most remarkable feature of this fiery new Jaguar is the way the chassis
engineers have combined super-sports handling with the marque's traditional
limousine-ride comfort and silence. The only clue that the tyres are getting
on for a foot wide is their tendency to tram-line - that is, dodge around
slightly from side to side on certain kinds of road surface.
Jaguar engineers were urged by the marketing people to stiffen the
suspension to make the car more overtly sporting (for which read less
comfortable). They resisted, and good for them.
The XJR has more cornering grip than can possibly be used on public roads,
yet it does not thump and bang over potholes. Its steering, while being much
more direct than on past Jaguars, is never twitchy. It was, I thought, one
of the best luxury cars, regardless of price, I have ever driven.
The Pounds 34,450 four-litre XJ6 4.0 Sport (249 hp) lacks the XJR's
super-charger and 17in wheels but, standing-start acceleration apart, seemed
to go almost as well. And the Pounds 53,450 XJ12 (318 hp) was everything one
expects of a chairman's carriage, with apparently unlimited performance on
tap.
Most user-choosers will go for the least-expensive, 219 hp, 3.2-litre XJ6, a
best buy at Pounds 28,950. They need not feel deprived, though. It might not
have the sling-shot acceleration of the more muscular versions but there is
more than enough power to cope with any conceivable situation. It cruises in
near silence and has Jaguar's superb ride.
I am told the Jaguar's enlarged boot will now take two sets of golf clubs in
their trolleys. We shall see - in the very near future, I hope.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Gardening: Stirred for spring - Robin Lane Fox offers a tip
on how to make the most of your bulbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cool, wet weather has rescued gardens for a suitable autumn finale and,
with renewed faith, I am planning for next spring at this crucial moment. We
have to stir ourselves now if we do not want a bleak April, waiting for
leaves to return to the trees. We must also stir ourselves if we do not want
a drab house in February.
Let me first pass on a lesson that is especially gratifying because most of
the nurserymen have not yet woken up to it. (There is not a word about it,
either, in any of the Royal Horticultural Society pamphlets, literature and
encyclopaedias which have been fast-breeding recently.) As a result, I can
tell the trade how to double its market and make us all spend twice as much
for better results.
It should start telling us that when we plant bulbs for use in the house, we
should pile them up in layers, one above the other. I mentioned this
revolution last year, having heard about it from that revolutionary
organisation, the Women's Institute. I can now confirm that it works.
Underneath last year's hyacinths, we planted a lower layer of the white
tulip Purissima. The hyacinths flowered late in January and, when we had cut
off the dead pieces and reduced the length of leaves by half, the tulips
appeared magically in bud and doubled the room life of the entire planting.
Bolder souls put a layer of crocus on top of the hyacinths, and some of the
robust and cheap yellow-flowered narcissi Soleil d'Or underneath. One lady
stockbroker, with a very deep container, went further. She wrote to say she
spent a happy Sunday packing in crocus, hyacinths, narcissi and, lastly, the
yellow-flowered lily tulip, West Point, which surfaced through the debris
late in March and gave a fourth season in a single bowl. She considered the
result to be the one investment she made last autumn which was actually
worth more by late March.
Like all revolutions, this one is expensive, but it doubles or quadruples
your return on time and space. But when I first heard of the WI suggestion,
I thought it must be a joke. Surely the shoots of the narcissus would
dislodge the hyacinths and the tulips would be stuck underneath in the
traffic jam? But no.
The key to success is a deep flower pot. The cheapest are plastic, but they
are even more hideous than the average run of glorified cache-pots from a
country gift shop. Indoors, I concealed them or planted directly into the
deep, fluted pots of off-white china sold by the Reject Shop at up to Pounds
9 each. While these have no holes in the bottom, this did not seem to matter
last year because I prepared the soil carefully and minimised watering after
planting.
The old way of minimising watering was to use a special bulb fibre, full of
oyster-grit and willing to retain a soaking for several months. Nowadays, I
cannot find this old-fashioned bulb fibre in general stores: what they sell
under that name is simply peat, recycled under a seasonal label. I have now
given up and simply use earth from the garden into which I mix a very small
dose of water-retention crystals.
Prepare the soil in a separate container by watering it, mixing in the
crystals like ground almonds into a Mediterranean cake: then, wet the
mixture lightly in order to activate the jelly. Next, pack it into the
bowls, making sure that you have not over-jellied the mixture; otherwise,
the bulbs will rot.
Follow the usual rules: put the bowls in a dark, unheated cupboard or
frost-proof shed where they can develop roots; the crystals should mean
there will be no need for more water. Bring them into a cold room after two
months, when the central layer of hyacinths should already be showing about
2in of yellow-looking growth above the soil. Give them a week or so in which
to develop away from central heating, then space out their entry into your
main rooms.
Layered bulbs will not flower for a second season indoors, but they seem to
recover outdoors and perform no worse than hyacinths which have been growing
in the usual segregation. Those of you marooned in London or a flat without
a serious garden ought to enjoy this multiplication of results in the same
space.
Outdoors, my plans now regularly concern two families to which I thought I
had waved goodbye not long after this column began. The bother of growing
one's own wallflowers and forget-me-nots was simply too much for today's
academic part-timer: anyway, I began to tell myself how frightful those
mustard-yellow wallflowers looked on Britain-in-bloom town roundabouts.
Of course, it was sour grapes, because wallflowers have an exquisite scent
and come in far better colours. They are back in my life with a vengeance,
especially since finding a local wholesaler who supplies the councils and
does the donkey work for me.
My lesson here is extremely simple: wallflowers are shallow-rooted and can
be grown in groups between the dormant plants of your main borders without
detracting from their later seasons. I keep returning to this discovery
because it has doubled the shelf life of my flowerbeds, just as layering has
doubled the life of the bulbs.
I plant groups of up to 20 wallflowers in reds, crimsons and the less robust
Ivory White (which is neither ivory nor white) and space them at
considerable intervals in the front to middle rows of the borders. There is
no need to go to the expense and trouble of a continuous carpet; in spring,
a few repeated groups of colour lead the eye down the bare earth and are,
visually, more effective. The inter-planting with wallflowers allows me to
cut down a dying border late in October, running two jobs together.
Lastly, the forget-me-nots. I have tried to live without them but I miss
them too much, just as the name tells us we should. Again, if you hunt
around, there is sure to be a big grower for the bedding trade nearby who
will do a deal on pre-grown plants in a serious quantity.
My lesson here is much less forgettable: if you have the choice, always go
for the smaller Indigo, not the taller and looser Royal Blue. Indigo is so
much brighter, deeper and more remarkable: it is twice the plant and, only
when I had been unfaithful to it for a few seasons, did I realise how much
better it was.
Once again, a few groups go a very long way; and, as it is so compact, you
can fit it into smaller beds near the house to flower in those weeks before
everything starts running wild.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Fishing: Trout that grew and grew
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL WIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Darwin landed on the Falkland Islands in 1834 he was unimpressed. Wild
cattle roamed a trackless waste otherwise devoid of mammal life. But Darwin
was not a fly fisherman.
Even if he had been, the meandering estuaries and thin, curling rivers would
have stirred no tremors in his casting arm, for the only freshwater fish in
the Falklands were two small species of no account. The estuaries were
dominated by bulbous-headed, slim-tailed grey mullet which slipped in and
out on the tide, not a sportsman's target.
Darwin's genius lay in looking back in time, not forward. Even the pioneers
of the 1940s, who changed the Falklands fishery, had no idea what their
actions would produce. Brown trout eggs were imported from England and
Scotland, making the 8,000-mile sea journey in trays of ice. On arrival in
sub-Antarctica they were transferred to milk-churns, strapped to horses, and
hauled to the interior. There they were put in the sweet waters of the
slow-moving, spring-fed rivers.
Brown trout are a resilient, adaptive, tough and invasive species.
Originally found only in Europe, today's map reflects their colonisation of
the rest of the globe. Wherever Europeans went they took fish with them, and
there are now naturalised populations as far apart as Japan, New Guinea,
Peru and Pakistan.
Within 10 years of the brown trout introductions, Falklanders found
themselves catching trout which had turned silver and grown immeasurably
bigger than their impoverished brethren.
The questing brown trout, finding inadequate food in the rivers, which were
also prone to dry up and lose essential oxygen, had migrated to estuaries
and the sea, where protein-rich krill swarmed.
The present record for a Falklands sea trout, winkled on to the bank of the
San Carlos river in 1992 by Alison Faulkner, a British angler, is nearly
23lb. Scale analysis showed it to be a remarkable 10 years old and to have
spawned at least five times.
Sea trout have this advantage over the Atlantic salmon, their rival
gamefish: they are better able to recover from the rigours of spawning, they
spawn more often and, because the core stock remains in fresh water, they
cannot, like salmon, so easily be exploited to the verge of extinction.
It is a curious fact of the brown trout's sea-going urge that it principally
motivates the female; males stay at home. When the female returns, silver
and big and bursting with ova from the tremendous larders in the salt, two
or three share a communal nest. The diminutive resident brown male can then
fertilise the eggs of several females.
Enough biology. The proper concern of all self-respecting Falklands visitors
is how to attach this gleaming silver maiden to a fly manipulated by a
fishing rod. The answer is, as it should be, with difficulty.
The really big fish in any migratory run need special attention. In the
Falklands the sea trout run into rivers from January until the end of the
fishing season in April.
The best fishing month is February. But the big fish tend to run together,
towards the end of the season, and waste as little time as possible in
freshwater. On the Chartres river, in West Falkland, ghillie Tony Blake said
he and Alison Faulkner had seen sea trout so big they could have eaten her
record-breaker.
Blake is a fishing phenomenon himself. Everything that happens as you fish
the pool under his eagle-eye relates to his search for the big fish. A 2lb
trout jumped. He said: 'Right. The big fella won't be here. He would have
chased that minnow out. Try there.' I did. He was there.
Meantime my fishing partner had caught 27 sea trout, averaging 2 1/2 lb, in
three hours.
Blake particularly likes the story of the American fly-dresser who came to
report on which of his 200 flies Falklands sea trout would take. 'How are
you getting on?' Blake inquired. 'Badly,' replied the American. 'They take
them all.'
If the Falklands was situated where the Canaries are, British fishermen
would be trampling the grass flat on the banks. As it is, virtually no one
goes there.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Lunch with the FT: A house-trained polecat and a gentleman -
Lucy Kellaway enjoys an old-fashioned English meal in the company of the
'Chingford skinhead'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When I told people I was having lunch with Lord Tebbit, some commiserated;
others forecast a stimulating occasion with a clever and amusing guest.
The former Tory party chairman and loyal keeper of the Thatcher faith is a
man no one feels neutral about. He has been called the Chingford skinhead
(he was MP for Chingford), a rottweiler, a semi house-trained polecat. He is
also known as a politician with the rare ability to speak directly to the
mass of the British electorate.
He had chosen to meet at Rules, in Covent Garden, central London, a
restaurant that serves soup with lumps of Stilton in it and Yorkshire
pudding the size of your plate.
I arrived early and was just reflecting that this was the perfect place for
a jingoistic Briton, when a thin bespectacled man slipped into the seat
beside me, quietly apologising for being a moment or two late. Small and
modest, this was not the person I thought I had asked to lunch at all.
Eyeing him as he studied the menu carefully, I asked if he was a foodie.
'Yes I am,' he said. End of conversation. He then commented on how much he
liked the menu's headings, 'Furred game', and 'Feathered game'. When I
recoiled he said that there was nothing wrong with 'Bugs Bunny in the pot',
and claimed he was happy to 'shoot, pluck and clean'.
The waitress, who seemed not to know him from Adam, appeared to take our
orders. True to form, he chose the Stilton soup, but followed it with salmon
in a fancy shellfish sauce and chose half a bottle of Australian chardonnay
of the sort you might associate more with Islington than Essex.
I told him that his secretary reckons he is wined and dined too much -
Claridge's one day and the Savoy the next. 'Yes I do eat out quite a lot,'
he said. Persisting, I asked if he enjoyed all this high living. 'I think I
just enjoy my life anyway. That's the key to it.'
This was getting desperate. Each word was separated from its neighbour,
delivered in a quiet monotone. Indeed, the volume was so low that had we not
been almost the only diners in the place - he had requested lunch at 12 - it
would have been hard to make out what he was saying at all.
He explained that the reason for the early hour was that on Tuesday
afternoons he recorded a TV chat show for Sky television with Austin
Mitchell, the former Labour MP.
I asked if he was happier asking the questions than answering them. 'I don't
know really, they are both jobs,' he replied. Which did he think he is
better at? 'It depends on the circumstances.'
I am sure Lord Tebbit did not mean to be unhelpful with these staccato
answers. Unlike many politicians, he evidently feels no need to project
himself as anything other than a regular bloke, neither does he believe in
talking for the sake of it.
We started to discuss television more generally, and for the first time the
flesh and blood Lord Tebbit started to resemble the mythical one. He
deplored the quality of modern drama and comedy, saying that nothing comes
close to The Two Ronnies of 20 years ago. I mentioned the Monty Python
repeats, and he looked sour. 'They were the beginning of a culture that says
if you use four-letter words everyone is meant to fall around laughing.'
He then started on television violence. 'Kids learn how to behave the same
way as dogs. They imitate the other ones in the pack. The pack they see most
of is television.'
From here it was a small step to the woes of the British educational system.
He told me a story about meeting a woman when he had been on holiday in
Barbados a few years ago. She had grown up in Britain, but had returned to
her home country because she did not want her children educated in an inner
London primary school. With my child just due to start at such a school, I
said that perhaps things were not as bad as all that.
He grudgingly agreed that some progress had been made 'over the -
unfortunately not - dead bodies of the educational establishment'. He
laughed a little at his remark. I laughed a great deal. Whatever you think
of the views, the rottweiler delivery is terrific.
He started to talk with pride about his grandchildren, who, he said, were
being brought up just as he brought up his children. This appeared to have
involved a good deal of discipline. Does he believe that children should be
hit when they misbehave? I asked the question, confident of his reply, and
he did not disappoint me. 'Yes,' he said. 'Yes I do.'
'I remember the last time I hit my younger son. He was about 16 at the time.
After I had hit him, he looked at me, picked me up like a baby and said,
'there, there daddy'. I realised I had lost that particular battle.'
The waitress brought the food and he started to eat, slowly and carefully,
leaving the vegetables to one side.
I asked how he was enjoying his new life as a non-executive director,
journalist and politician rolled into one. 'It is like a badly chosen
Chinese meal,' he said. 'Quite tasty but seems to lack a central theme.'
This was not the standard response from a former cabinet minister. Most
pretend that life on the sidelines is fun, but Tebbit does not go in for
such face-saving nonsense.
'I would rather be taking decisions and implementing them than be part of a
consensus-forming mechanism,' he says flatly. 'But that was a different
life.'
His present political role - which consists of attacking the government on
Europe, Ireland, crime and anything else that gets up his nose - is
apparently not to his liking. 'Politics is a thing I've tried to give up
many times,' he says. But he seems constitutionally incapable of taking that
step.
'I feel angry when I see things happening that are quite clearly going to
happen, particularly when I had warned they would happen. Then I comfort
myself by thinking: I may feel that way, but what on earth does the former
prime minister feel.'
I asked if he and Lady Thatcher get together frequently for mutual
hand-wringing sessions. Politely, he put me right. 'She's not a
hand-wringer. She's more likely to be a neck wringer. I'd join her there.'
He declined a pudding on the grounds that he likes his main meal with his
wife at night, before they settle down and watch News at Ten. I had had my
eye on the dessert, floating islands, but decide not to indulge on my own.
'I've saved your virtue,' he said, without irony. In his world, ladies have
virtue and gentlemen should defend it.
So far Tebbit had said little to justify his skinhead image. I asked how he
felt about being described as a 'semi house-trained pole cat'. As I said the
words he beamed with pleasure. His plain speaking, he said, had been helpful
in getting his views across. 'It happens to be in my nature anyway.'
I tried to extract more plain speaking by asking him about the progress of
the new Tory party chairman. He declined to take up the invitation,
preferring to attack his party's lack of direction. 'The government has too
many issues on which it is facing in two ways at once. We have a very tough
line on crime, but the prime minister personally intervenes to get two girls
out of jail in Thailand on a drugs charge. Kids whose behaviour is
thoroughly anti-social get rewarded with lovely holidays, whereas kids whose
behaviour is good and decent don't get rewards at all.
'On Europe we lean two ways at once: we want to be more closely integrated
with Europe, but do we want a two-speed Europe or not? Are we an
interventionist government in industry or not? Where do we stand on the
union of Northern Ireland?'
He starts to reminisce about his old job as party chairman, and tells me
that he was the 'destroyers' screen that protects the captain's ship from
attack'. Everything is quite different now, he said, pointing out that that
particular role does not exist. 'The prime minister is a very modest man,
and I'm not sure if he regards himself as a captain of the ship in that
way.' This did not sound like a compliment, neither was it softened by his
insistence that he has 'a good deal of affection' for John Major.
The greyness of today's political figures is part of a wider problem, he
explained. 'Huge mountain ranges never disappear in volcanic explosions.
They get ground down by glaciers and wind.'
'What?' I asked, querying this departure from plain talk into grand prose.
'The Commons is in the process of being eroded because its power is going
away,' he went on. 'Power has gone to the executive. It has gone outside to
market forces, and now is going to Brussels.'
There followed a long, committed speech about the nature of federal power in
the middle of which he mentioned 'an American with the unfortunate name of
Clint Bolick'. I smirked; he said it was 'not ladylike' to laugh.
He told me that he had not always been an anti-federalist. As a pilot in the
1950s he had more in common with his international fellow pilots than with
folk at home. He told a story about a night he and the lads got drunk and
how he planned to swap places with a Scandinavian pilot who looked the same
and who had the same number of children of the same ages.
He glanced at his watch and said he must go. Apropos of nothing, he laid
into Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, as he went. 'He's not a foreign
office secretary but a senior foreign office official,' he said, and started
ranting about people who live in houses with long front drives. 'Those who
have long front drives tend to be out of touch,' he said standing up to
leave.
I would be intrigued to meet his Scandinavian double. If he is out there,
perhaps he would agree to have lunch with the FT one day.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Save me from Healthspeak: Michael Holman feels patronised by
the language of Medical Correctness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Save me from Medical Correctness. Protect me from Healthspeak. Deliver me
from the well-meaning lobby that seeks to bowlderise and sanitise the
language of illness and adversity.
Let me declare an interest. I have Parkinson's Disease. Cabin staff on
airlines size me up in seconds. I make for my seat, unsteady on my pins,
stumbling over the odd word, and displaying that tell-tale tremor. 'What
have we here,' they seem to say. 'He must have drunk half his fare in the
Club Class lounge. One turn at the drinks trolley, and that's his lot.'
I can cope with this. Wear a black armband, is my advice to fellow
tremblers. The crew will then assume that you have been drinking to ease the
pain, and proceed to press double whiskies on you.
And nor do I mind taxi drivers who look the other way when I try to flag
them down, as I stumble out of my office late at night. They suspect that I
might bring up the one-for-the-road in the back of their cab.
But what I cannot abide is Medical Correctness, its patronising language,
and its Orwellian overtones. Is there a reader with a heart so hard that
they were not moved to laughter, or at least an incredulous snort, when they
read that the Spastics Society is to call itself Scope?
Any day now I suspect the Royal Society for the Blind will call itself
Vision, and the Parkinson's Disease Society will rename itself Horizon. Or
possibly Horizon]
One can accept the concern that spastic has become a term of abuse; perhaps
there is a case for a change of name. So why not the Cerebral Palsy Society?
This is dismissed as 'an easy and obvious step' by the society. The term
cerebral palsy is 'limiting, medical and rather ugly and old fashioned'.
Scope, on the other hand 'carries a degree of weight and a feeling of
progress and some other positive associations: opportunity, liberty, elbow
room etc'. The public relations campaign to replace its universally
recognised brand name by this vacuous alternative will, by the way, cost
Pounds 750,000.
I fear the malaise is spreading. The Parkinson's Disease Society is also
tampering with language. Please do not refer to people with Parkinson's as
'victims', or describe them as 'afflicted' by a 'crippling' condition, wrote
the society's press officer in its newsletter last year.
These words were 'judgmental', and bad for morale, readers were told. They
made us tremblers feel 'helpless, bitter and unattractive'. You should not
say that someone 'cannot walk', instead say 'uses a wheelchair'.
This suggestion did not go far enough, I wrote in a facetious letter. 'Words
such as crippling are not only judgmental, they are descriptive - two
disquieting features of far too many words and phrases in the English
language.'
'Clearly it is profoundly offensive to say that someone 'cannot walk'. But
to say instead 'uses a wheelchair', as the newsletter suggested, is
unacceptable,' I argued. 'Let us use the phrase 'enjoys enhanced mobility in
a seated position'.'
Alas, my letter backfired. The society thought I was serious.
But I will return to the fray, for the society recently launched what it
calls an awareness campaign. Its theme suggests that the society's left hand
does not know what its right hand is doing . . . rather like Parkinson's
Disease, come to think of it.
The newsletter describes how the television advertisement 'shows a
footballer striking the ball into the back of the net . . . fans erupt in a
sea of scarves and flags . . . cameras cut to a solitary figure who makes a
stark contrast to the animated activity around him . . . it depicts the
vivid and compelling eyes of someone with Parkinson's Disease, looking out
from a face which seems to be carved out of stone. Parkinson's has turned
this person into a statue.'
Well, it does not do much for my morale, I can tell you. If it raises
awareness, however, and gets research funds rolling in, I'm all for it.
But the society cannot have it both ways. If it does not want Parkinson's to
be called a 'crippling' disease, it should not use a face of stone-like
immobility as a shock tactic to elicit sympathy.
Drop the euphemisms, because they do not help. They do not fool the sick,
and they mislead the healthy.
Sufferers and victims, blind and crippled, let us raise our canes, rattle
our Zimmer frames, roll out our wheelchairs, raise our voices, and together
cry: 'Down with Healthspeak] Away with Welltalk]'
And speak up you silent masses, who are sound in wind and limb, heart and
mind. You may be inhibited for fear of being thought intolerant,
unsympathetic or insensitive - but it is your language that is being
tampered with.
Beware the day when Medical Correctness triumphs, and 'able bodied' and
'healthy' and indeed, 'fit as a fiddle' will be words that incur rebuke.
'How are you feeling,' your GP will ask. 'Not physically challenged, thanks

Medical Correctness is motivated by compassion, but seized by a dangerous
illusion: that if you change words, you change reality.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Truth of the Matter: The ghosts that lie concealed - A power
mightier than the pen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL SPIVEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Beauty does not qualify you as a novelist. Dame Iris Murdoch will take no
offence if one describes her appearance in terms of elderly grunge. Her
husband, Booker Prize judge John Bayley, matches her aptly with his
professorial bagginess.
Why should the essentially cerebral, hunched and private business of writing
demand painted nails and trim thighs? And yet there is no doubt that an aura
of pulchritude helps.
Joanna Trollope is on view in every bookshop window, in a misty vignette of
blonde allure. Donna Tartt pouts on her dust jackets like the classic belle
dame sans merci. Downmarket, Jackie Collins oozes ripe glamour; upmarket
Anita Brookner is fading, but still has the air of an arch schoolmistress at
whose feet one would gladly sit. And as for Jilly Cooper - her convent girly
radiance beamed above the frightful scrummage that is The Spectator's annual
party: she slew me with a wink.
Since looks sell books, it is not surprising that the superlative of all
supermodels, Naomi Campbell, should have become an author. Such is the
triviality of modern popular culture.
What has unnerved the literary establishment, however, is the extent to
which Naomi Campbell has dedicated herself to writing. According to one
slur, her publishers at Heinemann had to send her a simple 250-word synopsis
of her novel, Swan, in order that she might be able to tell people what it
was about. Not because, in the flux of creative energy, she had become
over-absorbed in her plot and her characters, but rather because the story,
in fact, was effectively composed by someone else.
Well, ghost-writing is nothing new. It is an odd variation of getting the
school swot to write an essay for you, but no great calumny attaches to the
process. It is generally known, for example, that whenever the reader of
Margaret Thatcher's memoirs comes across a flash of wit, or a nice turn of
phrase, then one of her several ghosts, John O'Sullivan, is revealing his
hand. Doltish sports personalities, too numerous to mention, have always
relied on spectral scribes; royalty, film stars and rock singers likewise.
If one describes ghosting as a form of collaboration, it begins to look
rather respectable. It is rarely revealed how far the verses of Keats - a
paradigm of isolated, hermetic genius - were altered or 'improved' by his
friends: the progress to 'fair copy' of his long poem Isabella, for example,
is strewn with corrections and interpolations from an unsung associate
called Richard Woodhouse.
John Stuart Mill's posthumously-published Autobiography is reckoned to have
had, technically, no fewer than seven authors (primarily his wife, Harriet).
The first-page pieties of thanking spouses for support probably conceal
masses of ghost-writing; and there is scarcely a book in the whole of
English literature which will not have been in some way shaped by its
printer, publisher or editor.
Not to mention, of course, those cases of literary association that obscure
pure authorship. How much of Conrad's work was done by Ford Madox Ford?
Which of Wordsworth or Coleridge was the more responsible for The Ancient
Mariner, and of Eliot or Pound for The Waste Land? And did Bacon write
Shakespeare?
The cult of the author is a powerful force: the local economy of
Stratford-upon-Avon will collapse overnight if it is ever demonstrated that
Bacon ghosted the Bard. Even when we know that an author such as Homer can
never have existed in any proper sense, we still like to cherish an image:
blind, old, wise Homer, who would have a cottage to visit if only we could
find it.
Knowing who wrote a poem or a story is, for many people, crucial to whether
or not they like it; no wonder the Sunday supplements like to tell us what
Peter Ackroyd has for breakfast, and publishers are so happy to have the
likes of Madonna or Naomi Campbell on their lists.
But in a wider philosophical context, it does not matter whether young Naomi
Campbell wrote a story called Swan or Nigel Spivey wrote it for her.
As French literary theorists would put it, there are no such things as
authors, only 'author-functions'.
Authors, as names in a catalogue, are useful for christening a particular
discourse, or placing some historical constraints on what their stories
might mean. But ultimately their own intentions belong to oblivion. The
supermodel author and her ghost are equally bound to be effaced.
The discourse of the novel belongs to greater powers than an individual can
wield: social systems, institutions and customs rule us all, including the
literary genius.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Cookery: Comforts of autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With all hope of an Indian summer now seemingly gone, this is the start of
the season for comfort foods. Goodbye, lightweight snacks, and hello to
meals you can sink your teeth into. Soon, we can expect the return of
porridge to the breakfast table, with kedgeree as a weekend treat. Crumpets,
toasted in front of the fire at tea-time, will follow along with a regular
intake of steaming soups and good, old-fashioned stews.
As the days get colder, there will be calls for even more substantial
offerings - such as sticky-rich oxtail, served on a bed of butter beans;
braised lamb shanks with split peas or little green lentils; beefsteak,
kidney and oyster pudding; lemon and treacle sponge; Sussex pond pudding;
and bed-time mugs of hot lemon and honey fortified with whisky or brandy.
Such extreme remedies are not required just yet, though. While some things
must be held in reserve for February, when winter's grip is at its iciest,
mild soothers are all you need to maintain morale in these days of early
autumn.
POTATO PIE WITH GREEN HERBS (Serves 6)
Potatoes and pastry sound too heavy by half, but this combination is more
refined than it sounds: it satisfies but does not stuff you solid. Serve it
tepid or, better still, just cold; indeed, it is recommended with cold roast
game birds after cups of hot consomme at shooting picnics. Lemon-and-herb
grilled chicken thighs and sauteed duck breasts are other meaty
alternatives. Use the lovely old English potato called Pink Fir Apple if you
can.
Ingredients: 1 1/4 lb waxy potatoes such as Pink Fir Apple, La Ratte or
Charlotte; 1-2 garlic cloves; a bunch of parsley (preferably flat leaf); a
bunch of thyme; 12-14oz puff pastry (made weight); 1 egg yolk beaten;  1/4
pt double cream.
Line a shallow 8-9in flan tin with just over half the pastry. Peel and slice
the potatoes thinly and chop the garlic finely. Mix them together with
plenty of pepper, some salt, 6 tablespoons chopped parsley and 1 1/2 -2
tablespoons fresh thyme.
Pile the mixture into the tin. Cover with the remaining pastry, damp the
edges, seal and trim. Knock up and scallop the sides and decorate the top.
Beat the egg with the cream and glaze the pie with some of it. Make a steam
hole in the centre of the pastry lid and insert a piece of rolled card to
hold it open.
Chill the pie for 20 minutes, then slide the tin on to a hot baking sheet
and put it into an oven heated to 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6). Turn down the
heat immediately to 375`F/190`C (gas mark 5) and bake for one hour until the
pastry is puffed up and brown and the vegetables feel tender when pierced
with a skewer.
Pour the rest of the egg-and-cream mixture carefully into the pie. Discard
the funnel of rolled card and bake for 10 minutes more. Cool the pie to
tepid or let it become just cold before serving.
APPLE AND ELDER PLATE PIE (Serves 6)
On September 29, according to country lore, Lucifer spits on blackberries to
spite his rival, St Michael the Archangel, whose feast falls on that date.
Time to cook apples with hedgerow elderberries instead.
These tiny, jet-black fruits hang their heads heavily like Victorian beads
when fully ripe. The taste of them is dark and mysterious: slightly sharp
and cloying, rich and pungent (a world apart from the Muscat subtlety of
elderflower blossom) and excellent for Sunday lunch puddings such as this.
Pick far more than you think you will need, as the fruit must be stripped
from the stalk with a fork before weighing - and the stalks are surprisingly
heavy.
Ingredients: 1 1/4 lb cooking apples; 10oz elderberries (weighed after
stripping them from the stalks); the juice of 1 lemon; shortcrust pastry or
pate brise made with half a pound of flour; beaten egg to glaze;  1/4 lb
caster sugar;  1/4 pint creamy-strained yoghurt or fromage frais or a
mixture of the two.
Peel and core the apples and put them into a bowl of water with the juice of
the lemon to keep them white. Put the apple cores and peel into a saucepan
with 5oz only of the elderberries, add 6-8 tablespoons water, cover tightly
and simmer for 20 minutes, crushing the ingredients with a potato masher
occasionally. Remove the lid and cook for about 5 minutes more to drive off
some of the liquid - but take care not to burn dry.
Tip the contents of the pan into a sieve placed over a bowl and press to
extract all the flavoursome pulp and juices. Sweeten the puree with 1oz
sugar. When cold, stir in the yoghurt and/or fromage frais gently, and
refrigerate.
Line a nine to 10in pie plate with half the pastry. Dry the apples, slice
them and toss them with the remaining 3oz sugar and the rest (5oz) of the
elderberries. Heap the fruit into the pie plate. Cover with a pastry lid.
Seal, trim, decorate, glaze with beaten egg and make steam slits.
Bake on a hot baking sheet at 400`F/200`C (gas mark 6) for 35-40 minutes.
Serve hot with the well-chilled sauce.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Balmy nights, barmy place - Munich
Oktoberfest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Munich's Oktoberfest is not for the faint-hearted. The beer is excellent,
and so are the spit-roasted chickens, grilled pork with crackling,
charcoal-grilled fish, salt-studded pretzels and sugar-roasted almonds. But
the crowds can be intimidating and the noise overpowering.
The promise of some of the world's best beer, plus the garish funfair
attractions and stomach-churning rides - not for trying, or even watching,
after downing the odd litre - draw more than 6m people a year to the field
where the world's largest beer festival is held over two weeks from late
September. (This year's ends on Monday, having been extended by a day to
include that day's German unification celebrations.)
Organisers of such events love to parade statistics about the vast
quantities of food and drink consumed. Those for the Oktoberfest are
formidable: 5m litres of beer, 733,000 chickens, 224,000 pairs of pork
sausages and 80 oxen.
When the weather is warm, as it often is at Oktoberfest time, the beer goes
down with an extra relish, its 5.5 per cent alcohol content giving it more
of a kick than Bavaria's normal brews. Munich's six main breweries -
Augustiner, Lowenbrau, Spaten, Hacker-Pschorr, Hofbrauhaus and Paulaner -
have their own huge beer tents, with brass bands blaring out oompah music to
the swaying drinkers, striving hard to sing, talk or retain control of their
senses against the onslaught of noise and alcohol.
On hot days, the best bet is to sit on the benches outside the tents and
enjoy the sun. By midday at weekends, most seats have been filled, serious
drinkers (some already the worse for wear) mingling with toddlers and
grannies.
After a couple of hours of this, sated with beer and heavy but tasty
Bavarian food, the crowds can become too much. When you can hardly take two
steps in any direction without being jostled by the mounting influx of
people, it is time to go home. The big wheel, dodgems and wildwater rides
can be left for another time - or for those with tougher constitutions.
But most people love it just the same. Those living in Munich try to go at
least once a year, often paying with beer and food vouchers handed out by
their employers or local companies. Since the beer costs nearly DM10 (Pounds
4) a litre this year, these are highly prized. Foreigners have discovered
the Oktoberfest in droves. Italians, Australians, New Zealanders, Japanese
and Americans are among the most enthusiastic visitors, but almost the whole
world is represented. Since the beer is strong - and far superior to the
'lagers' sold in some other countries  - headaches and hangovers can be
memorable. Surprisingly, violence is rare: people prefer to put their
energies into drinking and eating (mostly the former).
Munich is proud of its Oktoberfest, held on a field named after Princess
Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen whose marriage to Bavarian Crown Prince
Ludwig (later the first King Ludwig) was celebrated with a fair there in
October, 1810. It brings in around DM1bn (Pounds 415m) a year in food, drink
and tourism receipts.
Some Bavarians show themselves off in their lederhosen, worn with fancy
white shirts, knitted jackets, thick socks and boots and (for the really
traditional) hats with tufts of chamois hair. This get-up may be to prove
that they are Bavarians first and Germans second. (Some locals joke that
anyone sporting lederhosen is as likely to be a Prussian - the outdated
description many Bavarians give indiscriminately to all north Germans - as a
native of Germany's southernmost state.)
Bavarians certainly greet each year's Oktoberfest with gusto. On a balmy
evening, sitting outside with blue and white lights strung overhead, the
world seems to have little wrong with it. As more and more youngsters stream
on to the scene, with groups sharing a Mass (litre) or two among them, the
atmosphere is cheerful rather than menacing.
To anyone not steeped in the Bavarian dialect, the jokes shouted out from
along our bench by the well-oiled visitors from the country were almost
incomprehensible - even my Munich-born wife had to struggle to understand
them. Why was I so quiet, they asked. They accepted the excuse that I was a
foreigner - in two senses of the word, non-German and non-Bavarian.
At least, I was drinking Munich beer. As an antidote to communication
failures, it is almost unrivalled. With anything less thick than a rural
Bavarian accent, the alcohol can also act as a very effective, if
short-lived, conversational lubricant. After a time, it makes no difference
anyway. The beer does its own talking.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Good for buyers, less so for sellers - Wine
auctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first year since 1990, when the long, steady increase in London wine
auction prices was halted, Christie's and Sotheby's increased their turnover
in the 1993-1994 season. Christie's total sales rose in the UK from Pounds
5.6m to Pounds 7.4m and Sotheby's from Pounds 2.38 to Pounds 2.62m.
The year-end figures were helped by exceptional sales. Sotheby's, which has
generally restricted wine auctions to the UK, achieved a substantial
addition by the sale in Germany of the Thurn and Taxis wines that yielded
Pounds 863,000.
In June, Christie's held the largest ever private-cellar auction. It
belonged to Dr Remington Norman, a former member of the wine trade and an
author. With buyer's premium it yielded Pounds 1.5m, and some prices of
leading wines well exceeded their normal market level - Pounds 5,800 for a
case of Mouton Rothschild '61 (Pounds 4,200) Pounds 5,000 for Latour '61
(Pounds 4,000) and Pounds 720 for Taylor '63 (Pounds 600). These obviously
had some affect on the accompanying average top 1994 first-growth and
vintage port tables.
Far East wine buyers were prominent in Sotheby's June auction. To
commemorate the company's 250th anniversary, Philippe de Rothschild had
given four uncommonly large bottles of Mouton-Rothschild: one Jeroboam (six
bottles) of 1945 that fetched Pounds 14,250, and three Nebuchadnezzars (15
bottles) of 1975, 1982, and 1990 that made Pounds 9,900, Pounds 13,750 and
Pounds 12,650 - much higher than the estimate. They were bought by a far
eastern bidder.
Sotheby's does not provide an analysis of its annual wine sales, but
Christie's, in its King St auctions, increased the average lot value from
Pounds 391 to Pounds 483. Overall in the UK it slightly upped the percentage
of lots sold from 90 to 91 per cent. On the other hand its overseas sales
were well down, as it gave up US auctions that last year had yielded Pounds
2.6m; (see Antony Thorncroft's story below).
The accompanying table shows the average highest London auction house prices
between 1990 and 1994 of first-growth clarets and vintage ports.
Figures in the first-growth table, which omits Petrus as its saleroom prices
are so much higher than the others as to distort the averages, have risen
above their previous peak in 1990 - without taking account of inflation.
Among the nine other most prominent classed-growth clarets, recovery in
prices began more markedly in 1993, with less advance this year. Apart from
the increasingly rare '61s, the most sought-after vintage is '82, while '83
and '85 are probably under-valued. Although the '89s and '90s will be
increasingly popular vintages, their initial prices were so high, and the
quantities made so ample, that their saleroom prices may depend to a great
extent on inflation.
The sad wine, traditionally bought for long-keeping or investment, is
vintage port. The average top auction price this year is still below the
1990 level, although there is a clear difference between Fonseca, Graham and
Taylor and the other five leading ports. The three have been showing some
price life, but nothing to compare with the quality and the original price
of great vintages such as '63 and '77.
Assuming that the pace of economic recovery is mirrored in the wine
saleroom, the current period may be looked on as good for buyers, but less
so for sellers.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: The making of a vintage brew - Giles
MacDonogh travels to India to take tea, of the finest sort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the sun breaks through the clouds you may catch a glimpse of the peak
of Kangchenjunga from the terrace of the Darjeeling Club.
At 28,148ft, Kangchenjunga is the second highest mountain in the Himalayas.
That is to the north, in the province of Sikkim. Darjeeling is still called
hill country, although the hills rise to a dizzy 7,000ft.
Those hills are remarkably fertile. Waterfalls spout from every crag.
Occasionally, the sheer slopes are splashed with the multi-coloured saris of
the teams of Nepalese women who earn a crust by picking tea.
Making great tea is not so different from great wine. For grape variety read
tea bush. The best of all is the China bush, brought to Darjeeling by the
first planters 150 years ago.
Then there are China clones, Assam bushes and Assam clones. The Assam bushes
will give you a much brisker, more tannic cup, but they will never have the
delicacy of great Darjeeling.
The leaves are withered before they are dried. This process removes the
excess moisture in the leaf and begins the bio-chemical transformation.
Correct withering is crucial to the quality of the tea. If the tea garden
takes trouble over the wither, it will preserve the green-leaf character in
the China bushes; it is this which gives certain top quality Darjeeling teas
that raisiny, muscatel aroma.
Following the wither, the juice is extracted by rotating presses and allowed
to ferment. The leaves are then dried. But, here again, great care must be
taken: if the heat is too great the juices caramelise, giving the tea a
noticeable malty taste.
Like vineyards, each tea garden has its own character. There are 93 in the
hills of Darjeeling, plus another 44 down on the Terai, or plain.
Terai tea is mostly big, black stuff made by the the highly extractive CTC
process, although there are a few estates, such as Nuxal Bari, which produce
a wonderfully refreshing green tea. Real quality, however, comes from the
hills.
About 20 miles south east of Darjeeling town is Goomtee, where the
south-facing slopes rise to around 4,000ft.
At Goomtee they are at pains to separate the different varieties of bush and
process them apart. A good, second flush Goomtee, where the highly prized
shoots have accumulated more sap in their slower growth, often has a fruit
aroma: peaches or mangoes.
On the other side of the valley is Jungpana, one of the most sought after
teas in Darjeeling. Jungpana is astonishingly remote: there is no road, and
the tea needs to be brought over the valley to Goomtee before it can be
loaded on lorries.
When I was there in June, some leopard cubs had been seen among the tea
bushes, leading the pickers to conclude that an anxious mother would not be
far away.
Second-flush Jungpana has a cult following in Germany, and the garden's
favoured customers have convinced them to stop using pesticides on the
bushes.
In general, the move to organic farming in Darjeeling is greeted with relief
among the tea traders of Calcutta. The widespread use of nutrients in the
past has overworked the region's thin soils.
If the Germans appreciate the mellow, walnut flavour of Jungpana, they are
also the principal fans of the much more robust teas of Seeyok, a stunningly
beautiful estate south west of Darjeeling.
Seeyok has fully embraced organic methods now that three quarters of its
production goes to Germany. The bushes are not separated out, however, and
the garden is dominated by Assam hybrids, giving a bigger, more powerful tea
which has none of the delicacy of Jungpana.
Under the same ownership, and just across the river, is Selimbong. As the
teas here tend to walk out of the factory doors they are less in a hurry to
go over to organic farming.
The second-flush teas from Selimbong are among the very best Darjeeling has
to offer. There are no Assam bushes here and the style is the purest China
in all its delicacy.
Darjeeling tea is very similar to great wine. It is produced by a
combination of the right plants; the right soil and the perfect exposition.
But these geographical factors are not enough in themselves: there must also
be sufficient attention paid to the production.
Heavy-handedness in processing the tea can rob the leaves of that nuance
which expresses Darjeeling's landscape and the clean, crisp air of the
Himalayan foothills.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Sotheby's looks to Dollars 1m sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For all its louche image, New York can still show a puritanical streak, most
notably over the trade in liquor. No retailer can own more than one outlet
for selling wines and spirits and, until this year, wine auctions were
forbidden in the city. The New York Liquor Board bowed to heavy lobbying
from the retail and wholesale trades, which did not want a cosy duopoly
threatened.
So next Saturday is something of an occasion. Sotheby's, in co-operation
with Sherry-Lehmann, which owns a well-respected liquor store on Madison
Avenue, is holding its first sale in New York, and expects to raise more
than Dollars 1m from almost 1,000 lots of wine.
Oddly enough, Sherry-Lehmann was one of the fiercest opponents of wine
auctions but it is under its licence that Sotheby's is conducting the
auction in its York Avenue premises.
There is plenty of wine to sell on the East Coast. The Americans were
enthusiastic buyers of wine during the boom years of the 1980s and now that
prices have recovered from the post-1990 slump there are many well-stocked
cellars ready for thinning.
Unlike London, where auctions concentrate on the wines of Bordeaux and, to a
lesser extent Burgundy, New York will also offer Californian wines: included
in the first sale is an Imperial of Caymus 'Special Selection' Cabernet
Sauvignon 1986 estimated at up to Dollars 1,300.
It comes from the cellar of Sam Kaplan, a noted Manhattan lawyer, who has
consigned almost 375 cases of wine, including the much sought-after Cheval
Blanc 1982, with a case estimated at up to Dollars 2,200.
Even older wine comes from the cellar of John Packard and his father, the
late Frank Packard, who, along with Alexis Lichine, Andre Simon and Frank
Schoonmaker, is credited with popularising top quality French wines in the
US. The wines have been stored at extremely cold temperatures and Sotheby's
reckons they taste 'young and vibrant'. A case of the 1928 Chateau Lascombes
carries a top estimate of Dollars 3,000.
The Americans have lost their enthusiasm for oddities. In the 1980s an
American collector, or merchant, (often the late Malcolm Forbes), could be
relied on to bid thousands of pounds in the London auction rooms for some
undrinkable 19th or even 18th century bottle. It helped if it had once
belonged to Thomas Jefferson. The wines were placed in the windows of shops
or graced wine lists. They were never meant to be drunk.
One reminder of those dead days appears in the Sotheby's auction - a magnum
of 1870 Chateau Lafite which carries the label of Glamis castle in Scotland,
the home of the Queen Mother. The magnum was sold at Christie's in 1971 and
was recorked at the Chateau in 1991. It is said to be very drinkable: 'For
the wine lover who wants the ultimate experience,' oozes the catalogue. It
can be yours for approaching Dollars 20,000.
Sotheby's hopes to bring in Dollars 5m a year from four auctions in New York
and has already scheduled the next sale for February 4. Christie's, which
holds more auctions and brings in more turnover than Sotheby's in wine, is
watching closely. If it can find the right New York partner it will
certainly enter the field soon.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Fashion: Style of the well-disguised writer - Me and My
Wardrobe / Jane Mulvagh meets Harriet Sergeant who dresses so that she can
see without being seen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Harriet Sergeant's clothes, like her word processor, are a tool not a
plaything. They serve a professional purpose: to insinuate herself into
communities in order to write about them. Whether she is moving through the
black townships in South Africa, the waspish yuppies of New York's Upper
East Side, or teenage gangsters in a Shanghai brothel, her clothes signal a
wish to integrate.
'The right clothes can help to get people to talk. If I am in a difficult
situation,' she explains, 'I dress so that people will help me. For instance
in Soweto, where I was doing research for my book, I wore a conservative
pleated skirt and pretty blouse with high shoes to inspire respect and, more
importantly, to show them respect. Shorts and a T-shirt would have sent a
powerful message that you thought they were not good enough.'
There is an intelligent matter-of-factness in her approach. Like the spare
style of her prose, her clothes efficiently communicate a message. 'They are
armour, to be used as a disguise or a confidence booster,' she says.
Fitting in, socially and professionally, matters to Sergeant, 39. Firm
sartorial views would be an encumbrance when trying to assimilate the dress
codes of far-off cultures. 'You have to watch carefully,' she says. 'It
takes about a year to understand the unspoken rules - and then I can adapt
to that environment.'
Her latest book, The Old Sow in the Back Room, An English Woman in Japan,
draws on her experience of living in Japan for seven years after her banker
husband was sent there by his company. Putting aside her European notions of
individualism, she submitted to their dress codes and was able to understand
many levels of Japanese society.
'In the east women dress to please men. In the west women often dress to
please other women and many of the clothes are hated by men. Take Issey
Miyake. Most of my women friends love it. Stephen (her husband) can't stand
it]'
She was astonished by the women in Tokyo who wore Chanel suits to play in
sandpits with their children. Initially she rebelled, but the cultural
pressure was overwhelming and the snappy suits in her wardrobe bear witness
to the fact that she conformed. She drew the line at the 'lady-like'
Japanese taste for white lacy tights and white court shoes.
The influence of Japan lingers. Her wardrobe reveals that she broadly
adheres to fashion's diktats. The contents hang like entries in fashion's
seven-year diary: sharp, short suits circa 1987; sovereign-sized diamante
buttons fastening cream lace, 1989; Palio-print silk shirts and leggings,
1991 and textured crinkles, 1993.
She says: 'The English dress codes are the most complicated because dressing
down takes a great deal of effort. In Japan we dressed up to go out, just as
we do in New York. It's fun. Here they look down on you if you've made an
effort. It's so boring on the eye.'
Of her personal wardrobe, rather than her disguises, she admits to
difficulties in putting a look together. Now, with a bigger budget she buys
the whole designer outfit - 'Miss Matching, that's me' - or asks friends to
buy her clothes. She says you cannot find glamour in London shops.
At crucial moments in her life - her first dance, first day at Vogue, or
penniless and directionless on her return from South Africa - her mother
gave her a confidence-boosting outfit; a Biba strawberry pink mini dress; a
smart, 15-year-old Jean Muir dress, a leather jacket.
To Sergeant, the secret is not what clothes make you look like but feel
like. 'My mother would look at my face, not my body, and if it lit up and I
exuded confidence that was the right thing to wear. Most people don't notice
what you have on, they only sense your mood. Take evening clothes. I use
them like a whirlwind or a rocket behind me, whooshing me out of the door
filled with confidence.'
Her 'booster' clothes include a pair of shocking-pink kid gloves cuffed in
black marabou feathers; a Bruce Oldfield suit, and Montana suits with short
skirts to celebrate the Sergeant legs. 'This Montana which I bought a few
years ago was perfect for Tokyo in the 80s - all glamorous and glossy. The
cut makes me look slender.'
Necessity has shifted the emphasis of Sergeant's wardrobe. 'When I was
younger and spent my day as a writer at my desk, I often stayed in my
dressing gown or kimono until six in the evening. And then having suffered
Lonely Woman Syndrome all day, I'd go out and want to dazzle.'
The big change was having children. Suddenly the house was full of nannies
and dailies and she had to get dressed. The other change was coming back to
London last year. 'Here I have been into school runs, seeing publishers for
lunch so I had to buy smart day clothes for the first time. I buy one outfit
each season. Don't take me out to lunch more than once or you'll just see
the same suit again and again]'
By day she lives in Marks and Spencer's gilt-buttoned blazers,
brightly-patterned Gucci shirt and tailored trousers. 'It's my uniform. I do
try to conform, but I always seem to get it wrong - something just slips
in.' She gives the example of her 'I-am-a-banker's-wife' evening dress from
Tomasz Starzewski, a black and white column with modest bugle beading at the
neck. But instead of wearing predictable heirloom pearls and auntie's spray
brooch or a success-proclaiming Bulgari necklace, she wears it with hub-cap
sized African ivory and Indian silver bangles.
Country clothes are absent from her wardrobe. Brought up in north London she
admits to 'thinking of the countryside as Hampstead Heath'. During her
angst-ridden 20s she dated very English boys, alumnae of her Oxford days,
who would take her to cold country houses. 'I loathed it. Mud, cold,
cystitis, the wrong clothes - trying to look sweet and pretty in
puff-sleeved blouses]'
Then she met Stephen Cohen, her husband who works at SG Warburg. He
encouraged her to wear sexy shapes in dark colours instead of trying to look
like an overgrown girlie. It suits her psyche and she is happy.
To her horror, after 11 years of marriage, Stephen is suggesting they move
to the country. To endure her 'green hell' she has reluctantly bought what
she archly calls a 'Berber' waxed jacket, a knowing mispronunciation
intended to communicate her irritation.
Showing us her clothes, Sergeant realised she kept them like letters. 'They
remind me of things that have happened and it is all rather moving. I met
Stephen in that jacket.'
As a chronicler of other cultures she is a person who looks out rather than
in on herself. When I encouraged her to examine her 'wrappings', she
realised that she had not dissected them with the sharp eye she applies to
the characters in her books. She enjoyed the process - she says.
The Old Sow In The Back Room, An English Woman In Japan is published on Sept
15, John Murray, Pounds 17.99.

FT  01 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: Natural life in Deccieland - Lucia van der
Post surveys the latest trends in interior design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Domestic interior design, like all the unspoken languages that are part of
our social fabric, is subject to the whims of fashion, but the time-scale is
happily much slower than in the world of frocks.
Few of us have the time, the energy or the money to change our houses or our
interiors as frequently as we do our clothes and anyway it usually takes
many years to put a home together.
Nevertheless, it is clear that a fresher, cleaner, lighter approach to the
domestic interior is emerging. Last week at Decorex, Deccieland's equivalent
of the Paris catwalk shows and the event that no interior designer worth her
chintz dare miss, all the new trends were on view.
The show itself grows better and better - displays and room settings are
beautifully organised and full of inspiration for those looking for fresh
ideas - so it is a great pity that last year's attempt to allow the public
in has not been followed up this year. Instead, the ideas will have to be
filtered through the trade representatives who alone were allowed into the
hallowed halls.
For those who are nervous of speaking to interior designers, fearful that
they are going to be persuaded to spend large sums of money on bizarre
obelisks and peculiar tassels, the Interior and Decorators and Designers
Association is there to help.
The IDDA offers lots of advice on how to get the best from interior
designers, what they can and should not be expected to do and how to look
after the costs. Its free leaflet is called Why You Should Use an Interior
Designer (write to IDDA, Crest House, 102-104 Church Road, Teddington,
Middlesex TW11 8PY or tel. 081-977 1105).
If you have an empty room and cannot wait to know what to do with it, I
asked two interior designers, Jennifer Sisson of JPS Design, Brundish,
Suffolk and Lavinia Dargie of Dargie Lewis Designs, London SW6 for their
views.
They spoke almost as one: natural is in. Jute, linen, cotton, silk are the
'in' fabrics. Jute and sisal come in floor coverings (nothing new) but also
in fringes and tie-backs. Out go frou-frou window treatments and an
over-abundance of paint effects. In come shutters, simple blinds and a more
tailored look for curtains.
Traditional paint colours are very in. Those with little to spend can cool
down and simplify the interior by re-covering cushions in pale neutral
colours, and using throws to change the mood of sofas and chairs instead of
going to the expense of reupholstery. Above all, if in doubt, keep it
simple.

FT  01 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: Serve a touch of creativity at your table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maryse Boxer is a designer who has brought all her talents to bear on a
small but fascinating area of domestic life - the table top. Originally a
textile designer in France ('I was working with Cacharel in his heyday') she
then produced the colours for Dior's first cosmetic line, but all the while
she loved collecting china and playing with table settings, writes Lucia van
der Post.
When her husband's work brought her to London she started experimenting with
her ideas for tableware. 'In the US there was a cheap and cheerful range of
tableware called Fiestaware which came in lots of different colours and you
could play around with different combinations and that was when I began to
think about doing a range of my own.'
To begin with she made modules in cardboard, playing with light, shape and
texture - she would see how a matt small plate set off the contrasting gloss
of a shiny one, how a round plate set on a bigger curvy one could enhance
the interest in both and how a smooth finish would provide a rich contrast
with a rough one. She began to see the table as a creative outlet for every
woman's domestic talents.
From having an original idea to a saleable product is usually a long and
difficult step but when Joseph Ettedgui, the retailer behind the Joseph
empire, said he wanted her to do a black and white collection for Joe's Cafe
in Draycott Place which he was about to open, Boxer was off. 'I knew nothing
about ceramics - I had just fiddled about with these ideas on bits of
cardboard but Joseph did not want to know anything about my manufacturing
problems. I was on my own. It had to be ready for the opening and it was.
Joseph started selling the range in his shop Pour La Maison. Barney's in New
York saw it and wanted it. Then The Conran Shop and so on.'
After her minimalistic black and white range for Joseph she did Rainbowware
 -a brilliantly coloured range of cups on leaf-shaped saucers offering a
huge variety of colour combinations - for Aroma Cafe. The trendy crowd who
drink Aroma's coffee can buy the ceramics when they finish.
Since then her range has expanded to take in glass - champagne flutes which
double as vases or candle-holders and drinking glasses and pale coloured
plates, some of it made in Italy and embellished with gold-leaf. Then there
are napkins - crinkled linen and polyester, completely washable and needing
no ironing - and cups and saucers and plates of every size and in every
mood.
Her main aim is to offer her customers choices. 'I wasn't interested in
designing just a glass. I wanted everything to be multi-media and multi-duty
so that the table can be as personal and as creative a medium as the clothes
that people wear. Everything I do is always hand-finished so that they are
all slightly different. That is what gives the pieces life.'
From this week the whole range of her wares can be seen in the basement of
Chez Joseph, 26 Sloane Street, London SW1 where she shares the space with
the furniture designer Carolyn Quartermaine.

FT  01 OCT 94 / How To Spend It: IKEA remakes Swedish history
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For those of us accustomed to thinking of Ikea as that nice inexpensive
Swedish operation that would sell us some bargain-priced household furniture
and accessories if only we could find the place, it is something of a
turn-up to discover that it is selling elegant copies of 18th century
Swedish furniture. Ikea has traditionally been regarded as that paragon of
Scandinavian contemporary chic, so democratic, so respectful of the taste of
the the masses. The notion of it dealing in reproduction furniture is enough
to send one scurrying to see what it is all about.
What we find is an instructive example of how reproduction furniture has
become entirely rehabilitated by the taste police. Not, of course, any old
reproduction and certainly not what the late Sir Paul Reilly, the first
director of the Design Council used to call 'ruptured repro', but
reproduction furniture that comes with proper history and what in these
circles is referred to in a hushed voice as 'authenticity'.
Some of us have never minded too much about authenticity, preferring to rely
on something much more primitive such as do we like it? Would it look good
in our house? Can we afford it?
It has to be said that Ikea's selection of 18th century furniture, a style
known as Gustavian, passes almost all the tests. And it has 'authenticity'
as well.
The hallmarks of the style are a simplicity which tunes in beautifully with
the 1990s mood in furnishings - floors are stripped wood, furniture often of
painted wood, the colour scheme is restrained, relying on muted blues,
whites, greys and yellow for light. Fabrics are simple, often blue and white
checks, simple cottons and muslins.
The overwhelming impression of the Gustavian interior is one of light, air
and tranquil simplicity. The pieces Ikea has developed, in conjunction with
the Swedish Central Board of National Antiquities, are the props that will
bring this vision to life.
Every piece was copied from one of the examples in a priceless collection of
18th century Swedish furniture in the old spa town of Medevi. Its future was
under threat because of lack of funding until Ikea and the Swedish Board of
National Antiquities struck a deal. Ikea would safeguard the future of the
collection it it were allowed to produce faithful copies of the originals.
Each piece has been made by following the methods used by Swedish craftsmen
of two centuries ago and using materials that are almost identical.
For instance, hand-painted blue and white china is made in the same province
of China as the original pieces from the same sort of clay. Glassware is
mouth-blown and the results are so close to the original that the
reproduction glasses have had to be engraved to prevent them being confused
with the originals.
There is a wonderfully ornate and glittery chandelier, based on a 17th
century version that hangs in an upstairs room at Sturehov Manor outside
Stockholm. Then there are sofas, such as the one photographed above, side
tables, bookshelves and chairs.
Prices seem excellent for the quality on offer - the most expensive item is
the Svenskund sofa which is Pounds 1,250, while the chandelier is Pounds
350, the ladies' writing table is Pounds 320, the four-poster bed Pounds 920
(excluding the mattress). Look out, too, for some hand-carved gilded
mirrors, with or without sconces, at prices ranging from Pounds 59 to Pounds
295.
It is only available at Ikea stores at Brent Park, Wembley and Purley Way,
Croydon.
A new book, The Swedish Room by Lars and Ursula Sjoberg (published by
Frances Lincoln, Pounds 20), is a beautiful evocation of that way of life.
Here are uncluttered rooms, peaceful, comfortable, frugal, yet elegant.
Light suffuses the spaces, well-proportioned houses are surrounded by quiet
woods, unpolished pale floors gleam in the soft northern sunshine. It is a
visual feast for those who aspire to these gentle domestic interiors.

FT  01 OCT 94 / FT Ski Expedition: The pre-war experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arnie Wilson and Lucy Dicker are attempting to ski every day of 1994 on a
round-the-world expedition. They are currently exploring the mountains of
New Zealand
Last time anyone told me not to be afraid was 10 years ago when an
instructor, Daniel Hansjacob, was about to take me down my first couloir in
Val d'Isere. This time it was Arthur Tschepp, a 67-year-old Serbo-Croat and
he was reassuring us about the hair-raising drive (reminiscent of some of
our journeys in the Andes and Himalayas) to Awakino, New Zealand, in his
ancient Land Rover.
Tschepp who learnt to ski on barrel staves in the hills above Zagreb (where
he also diced with death with the trams by tobogganing in the streets using
ice skates to steer) is patron of Awakino club field, with the smallest
membership in New Zealand (200).
He is also the latest member of New Zealand's One Ski In the Grave Club
(open to 55-year-olds and over).
The Land Rover, made in 1950 and brought from Britain to New Zealand in the
1970s by a visiting Maori, makes a noise like a tug-boat. 'It was perfectly
all right until some hoodlums out possum shooting shot through the
windscreen, and stole the carburettor, battery and drive shaft,' explained
Tschepp.
'I managed to make a new drive shaft by cutting down an old one from a
standard vanguard, and I cannibalised three carburettors to make a new one.'
Arthur knows a thing or two about cannibals. He worked with them in Papua
New Guinea in 1954, clearing up the havoc after 3,000 people were killed
when Mount Leamington erupted. 'I can work with cannibals. They are much
less difficult than some of today's teenagers.'
By now we have reached the Awakino ski lodge. Even Tschepp admits it is
basic. But he is such a gem we do not mind.
It is so cold that Lucy and I climb into our borrowed sleeping bags still
wearing our cold-weather Degre ski suits. Outside, in this rarefied
atmosphere the stars sparkle like a million snow crystals.
This, it occurs to me, is a skiing time warp. We are experiencing pre-war
skiing: it is still happening today in New Zealand's club fields.
On our bedroom wall is an account of a skiing trip by children from
Otematata School. Choice highlights include: 'The ski instructors kissed us
all goodnight (yuk])' and 'We all liked the times Mr Gulliver and Mr Gray
fell over'.
Lucy and I sympathised with Mr Gulliver and Mr Gray. We just could not get
on with the 'nut-cracker' devices used to attach yourself to the
tractor-driven rope tows. (There are four at Awakino: Access, Ridge, Main
and Learners.)
I suffered quite a nasty rope-burn during my first attempt, and when we both
finally got to the top of the mountain, snow conditions were among the most
difficult we had experienced in almost 200 ski resorts.
It was the moment of truth for us as we started our tour of New Zealand's
club fields. Like many of them, Awakino has no grooming. If we were clumsy
in our attempts to get up, we were inglorious in our attempts to ski down.
'I guess this is just what it must have been like between the wars in the
Alps,' I said to Lucy. 'I'm glad it's not like that any more,' she said.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Costly chip off an old block -
Clive Fewins visits a family stonemasons which nearly cracked after 200
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idiosyncratic stonemasons' yard at Lloyds of Great Bedwyn, near
Marlborough, Wiltshire has been an irresistible lure for generations of
children from the village school next door.
'Press the button and the fountain will work,' says the ageing hand-cut
plaque attached to a statue of a greek goddess that stands precariously on
the front wall.
It still does work. Follow the instructions and a huge and noisy plume of
water cascades from a giant urn at the rear of the yard, which also houses a
bewildering array of items, from Chinese granite lions to teddy bear
headstones, medieval-style carved grotesque heads, and a scaled-down stone
replica of a Sopwith Camel first world war aircraft carved as a memorial to
an airman killed in 1917.
All the 'exhibits' in the yard are of stone, as are the 100 or so plaques
and inscriptions in the collection attached to the side of the Victorian
brick headquarters of the five-man company.
They have been collected by members of the seven generations of Lloyd who
have run the family business, and passers-by are welcome to drop in and view
the collection.
One might reasonably think such an established enterprise serving a wide
area with items from churchyard memorials to marble bathrooms, floors,
worktops, fireplaces and stone garden ornaments, would be as solid as the
Bank of England. Yet two years ago the business came as close to collapse as
it has in 204 years of existence.
John Lloyd, 38, who took over the reins from his father Ben 12 years ago, is
still paying the price for a brief collaboration with an old friend that
lasted two years and had damaging effects on his original business.
'Despite the onset of the recession in the late 1980s we were doing really
well. I had a staff of five, plus a secretary, and we were turning over
Pounds 250,000,' said Lloyd.
'We were having to work harder for our money than we did in the boom of the
mid-80s, but life was varied and enjoyable, and there was no shortage of
work, including a number of lucrative marble fitting jobs in London.
'We had managed to keep up with mechanisation, and there was still a healthy
demand for the high quality hand letter cutting in which we have always
specialised. However with the increase in demand for marble work I thought
it would be a good idea to join up with an old friend who was disillusioned
with his job working for a major marble importer, and form a new enterprise
importing and wholesaling all forms of marble.
'We ran the business as a separate entity from here. The first mistake I
made was to resolve to draw no salary from the new business, believing, in
my naivety, that it would pay me back later.
'After 12 months I was aware that I was putting three-and-a-half days a week
into the new venture and the masonry business was suffering.
'Almost before I realised it the family business had built up an overdraft
of Pounds 40,000 - we had never owed anything like that before - and the
bank was getting uneasy. My neglect of the family business meant that the
work volume dropped because I was putting in less time and thought into
gaining the all-important small jobs that traditionally grew out of bigger
contracts.
'Further, having realised what was going on I was far too slow to act. By
the time I stood firm, things were so bad that my main business was on the
point of foundering.
'The family firm had been landlord to the other enterprise, and was also
bearing nearly all the overheads and even supplying some of the staff. It
was therefore no surprise that the new venture was making money at the
expense of the older one, and also sucking the life blood out of it.'
By the time Lloyd decided to cut his losses and get out, the stonemasonry
business was turning over less than Pounds 100,000.
He sold his share of the new business for Pounds 30,000 and heaved a sigh of
relief. He estimates that, altogether, lost earnings, additional overheads
and payments for the redundancies that followed the episode cost him nearly
Pounds 100,000.
'It was a very low period. I felt I had been a total fool and this hit very
hard.
'But now, two years after it all came to an end, I realise that the episode
made me look hard at things and determine to improve our ways of doing
business,' Lloyd said.
Fortunately there was a white knight waiting in the wings. Charles Webb, the
father of Lloyd's long-time girlfriend had recently retired from running a
water management system company, and he immediately set about trying to
right things.
Lloyd had the unpleasant task of making two long-serving employees
redundant, thus reducing the male workforce to three plus himself, and then
carrying out a full stock check at Webb's insistence. Webb also persuaded
him to sell surplus unwanted stock and end his time-honoured practice of
buying small pieces of stone he liked the look of when visiting a wholesaler
because he thought they would be useful additions to his stock.
Webb also insisted that the huge collection of statuary and stone artefacts
outside should be made the personal possession of Lloyd so that if the
business foundered it might not have to be sold. He also introduced
computers - which Lloyd still loathes - cash flow projections, and a new
accounting system. He gave - and still gives - his spare-time services free
of charge.
The result was that last year after nearly two years of foregoing a salary
and living off savings, Lloyd was able to start paying himself again. This
year the overdraft slowly began to drop and he is thinking of taking on a
trainee to join his three other men.
'Turnover this year should be about Pounds 120,000 and I am hoping we shall
show a profit of a few hundred pounds,' Lloyd said.
'I have learned a lot - particularly the wisdom of drawing up a full legal
agreement before entering into an partnership, even if it is with an old
friend.
'However, the one thing I won't do is give up my ledgers,' he said. 'The
firm has a collection of written records going back to 1800 and I can easily
open a ledger and look up details of jobs going back as much as 70 years.
'This can be very useful. Only a few months ago I had a chap come in who
seemed very grand. He wanted a memorial, and baulked at paying a deposit,
saying his family had traded with us for several generations, though he
admitted they hadn't used us since the 1950s.
'We sat together and thumbed back through the ledger until we found the
record of the job, 40 years ago. A neat note on the bottom of the entry in
my grandfather's handwriting stated that these customers were slow to pay.
The point was taken. Nothing was said, but he gave me a deposit.'

<TEXT>
The table shows capital gains tax indexation allowances for assets sold in
August.
Multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure for the month in which
you bought it. Subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale; the
balance will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in September 1985 and sold
them in August 1994 for Pounds 13,000.
Multiplying the original cost by the September 1985 figure of 1.516 gives
you a total of Pounds 9,096.
Subtracting that from Pounds 13,000 gives a capital gain of Pounds 3,904
which is within the CGT allowance of Pounds 5,800.
If selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the March 1982
figure. The RPI in August was 144.7.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Better deal on insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Soon after buying a new car recently, I discovered my insurance broker had
not offered me a very good deal; other firms offered better motor policies
for around Pounds 50 less. I asked him if I could cancel my existing policy,
get a pro-rata refund and change to a better company.
I was told I would get a refund equivalent only to my paying about Pounds 50
for just one month's insurance. I asked for confirmation and was told the
company would not quote an exact figure until I had committed myself to
cancelling the policy. Is the company wrong by refusing to say what the
refund would be until I have committed myself?
It appears you are paying the penalty of trying to cancel a policy very soon
after its initiation. The company incurred administration costs in setting
up the policy for your new car, and it would be difficult for it to quote an
exact refund figure until you had given it a specific date and confirmation.
We feel sure, however, that if you apply to the company, you will be able to
get an accurate estimate of the costs involved.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I have been trying for some time to get a satisfactory answer from both my
wife's and my tax office to the following question: 'With the introduction
and expansion of the 20 per cent tax band, why does the Inland Revenue still
expect employers to deduct tax at 25 per cent for ad hoc work?'
Surely, someone who is not going to work regularly should be taxed at the
lowest band - ie, 20 per cent?
Questions of Revenue policy are outside the scope of local tax offices. Send
your question to the Controller, Inland Revenue, Insurance and Specialist
Division (Schedule E), 550 Streetbrook Road, Solihull, West Midlands B91

FT  01 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: I trust my broker, but . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I hold a small portfolio of shares registered in my name. Following recent
shortening of the period for settlement after any share transaction, it
appears sensible to follow my broker's recommendation that my holdings be
transferred to a nominee account registered at the address of his employer
(an associate company of a European bank).
To effect this change, I was sent a bundle of stock transfer forms for my
signature with the broker's assurance, as follows: 'I confirm that the
transfer of your securities into . . . nominees will not affect the
beneficial ownership. Each valuation that we send you will include a list of
those stocks which are owned by you, held to your order in our nominee
company.'
I have complete trust in the integrity of my broker. But is this informal
statement of my interest all that I should require as a reasonable but
prudent investor?
The broker is correct that a transfer of your securities into a nominee name
will not affect the beneficial ownership. The legal ownership of the shares
is held by the nominee company in trust for yourself, and it has all the
obligations and fiduciary responsibilities of trustees towards you.
You have, it appears, already assured yourself of the integrity and company
standing of your broker. You might be interested to acquire the booklet
entitled Self Defence for Investors. This is available free on request from

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some time ago in the FT, I read an article saying that losses in private
managed companies can be set against income. My accountant says it does not
apply to offshore trusts. Is he correct?
The article you read was talking about sections 573 to 576 of the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act 1988. To satisfy yourself that your accountant is
right, go to a local reference library and look up these provisions in one
of the multi-volume tax works, such as the British Tax Encyclopedia.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
We have a deposit account with an English building society on the Isle of
Man, primarily to receive interest before tax is deducted. Would it be legal
 -that is, tax avoidance rather than tax evasion - if, when the interest was
due, we travelled to the island, withdrew the interest and spent the money
there? And would we need to declare the amount of interest spent on our next
tax return?
You forgot to tell us where you and your husband are domiciled. If, as well
as being resident and ordinarily resident in the UK, you and your husband
are domiciled in England and Wales (or in Scotland or in Northern Ireland),
then you are liable to pay UK tax on the Manx interest regardless of whether
or not it is remitted to the mainland.
On the other hand, if (despite being resident and ordinarily resident in the
UK) you and your husband are domiciled somewhere else, you would not have to
pay UK tax on the interest.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Misplaced confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surprising faith in the government's generosity has been revealed by a
telephone poll seeking people's views about the payment of mortgage interest
relief for people who have been made redundant. Just over one in three think
the government will pay all the interest from day one. In fact, it will do
so only after 16 weeks.
The poll, conducted by Audience Selection, was commissioned by Alliance &amp;
Leicester building society which, until November 12, is offering a year's
free unemployment insurance with its fixed rate or discounted mortgages. In
the case of a joint mortgage, the insurance pays half the amount if one
borrower becomes redundant.
More generally, however, the poll comes against a background of lobbying by
mortgage lenders to try to prevent the government curtailing mortgage
interest payments for people on income support. Already, the payments are
not available for loans above Pounds 125,000, or for people with more than
Pounds 8,000 savings.
There were more mortgage rate announcements this week. Woolwich has
increased its standard variable rate by 0.35 of a percentage point to 8.1
per cent, the same as the Halifax. Midland, National Westminster and Lloyds
bank are all moving to 8.1 and join Barclays bank, which made its
announcement earlier.
Variable rates at Scottish banks are better - the Royal Bank of Scotland has
passed on the full half percentage point increase but its standard variable
rate is now 7.99 per cent. Bank of Scotland also moves to 7.99 per cent on
Monday from 7.64 per cent.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Life offices face shake-out - At
least 40 could close under new rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Consumers should benefit next year when life insurers enter a period of
increased regulation and price competition.
What is not clear is whether the predicted demise of at least 40 of the
total 103 life offices is entirely good news. Clearly, it depends on whether
you buy your long-term investment product from a winner or loser.
The trigger for the shake-out is the introduction in January of rules that
require life offices to tell clients exactly how much they pay advisers and
salesmen in commission, and what deductions they make for administration.
Until then, they can hide behind meaningless 'standard charge' illustrations
that tell you nothing.
Naturally, the low chargers and the top performers (not necessarily the same
offices) are fairly relaxed about their future. The rest are worried.
Last week, we reported a Money Management survey on personal pensions which
revealed that the Hearts of Oak friendly society deducted 40 per cent of a
client's premiums in charges. From January 1995, the client will be told
about these costs before making a commitment - and is likely to buy
elsewhere.
In theory, providers who combine high charges with poor performance should
go to the wall. In practice, the government is unlikely to let this happen
because of the destabilising effect this would have on an already
beleaguered life and pensions industry.
Instead, we are likely to see a series of take-overs and mergers led by the
companies with the most financial clout.
Only this week, Sir Mark Weinberg, the man behind some of the largest and
most successful direct sales operations, announced he was to chair a new
company with a Pounds 100m 'vulture fund'.
His aim is to hover over the stragglers, pick off the best, close them to
new business and manage their existing funds.
Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the consulting actuary which is predicting the demise of 40
life offices, also said that just 10 per cent of existing offices appeared
to be cost-effective. It added: 'The remainder, mostly traditional life
offices, are leaving themselves open to attack by the new, lower cost,
simple-savings providers.'
The question investors should be asking is: 'If I invest with a life office
that subsequently is taken over, will my fund be well managed?' (After all,
financial clout is not synonymous with good performance and low charges).
The answer, unfortunately, is: 'That depends.'
In theory, a fund that is closed should do well because it does not bear new
business costs. On the other hand, if the high charges imposed by the
original life office are maintained, along with the early termination
penalties, you could be stuck in a situation where it is unprofitable to
stay but expensive to get out.
To make its predictions, Bacon &amp; Woodrow considered the cost of acquiring
new business and maintaining policies in force. It then provided a rough
identikit of the survivors but no actual names.
Among the survivors, however, B&amp;S listed bancassurers (which sell financial
products to bank or building society customers) and life offices that
concentrate on specialist products sold through independent advisers.
Clear losers were the subsidiaries of foreign companies, which made up the
bottom 10 in the rankings. Also at risk were the broad-based, medium-size
life offices that try to be all things to all men - and, in practice, do
nothing very well.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Choose right and double your money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you want to take advantage of stock market growth but prefer the pooled
route rather than direct investment, the choice of products and providers is
bewildering.
The latest survey of the most popular savings products from life offices
shows that, with the right choice, you can double - even treble - your
money. But if you get it wrong, your initial investment could be halved.
In its 1994 survey* of unit-linked products, Money Marketing examines the
charges and returns for maximum investment plans, single premium bonds and
personal pensions, among others.
Maximum investment plans and single premium bonds compete with other pooled
investment vehicles - in particular with unit trusts - but there are
significant differences in the way these funds are taxed. Life office funds
are liable to basic-rate income tax and capital gains tax, but some
'qualifying' products can offer a fund that, at maturity, is free of
higher-rate tax. This is because the product has an element of life
assurance.
While these products can be attractive to higher-rate tax payers, those on
the basic rate have little to gain. John Jenkins, of actuary Alexander Clay
&amp; Partners which co-produced the survey, says: 'Investors should note that
the income tax charged on the fund cannot be reclaimed.
'The same is true of the capital gains tax which is charged on the build-up
of the life fund. You cannot get a refund even if you have not used up your
annual CGT allowance. In this respect, unit trusts are better, because CGT
is not charged on the build-up of the fund and, when you are assessed for
this liability, you can use your allowance to offset the tax.'
Even higher-rate taxpayers should check, before signing up for one of these
products, to see if the same result can be achieved by separating the two
key elements - say, by using a unit or investment trust for the investment
and simple term assurance for the life cover.
Jenkins adds: 'For the more active investor, a maximum investment plan is
more flexible and cost-effective for switching between funds. But if all you
want to do is pay a regular amount to a managed or standard equity-based
fund, then unit trusts offer better value.'
Maximum investment plans
These are regular premium savings plans that run for a minimum of 10 years
and offer life cover worth at least 75 per cent of the total premiums paid
over the term of the contract. The survey shows how the returns vary
considerably. Top provider for a Pounds 70-a-month investment over 10 years
was M&amp;G with Pounds 15,250. Worst was MGM, which returned Pounds 10,799.
Charges also vary significantly. If you invested Pounds 100 a month for 10
years, the projected total (where no charges are deducted and assuming 7.5
per cent growth a year) is Pounds 17,659. The effect of London Life's
charges would be to reduce this figure by Pounds 1,269 while the
corresponding figure for the highest charger, Reliance Mutual, was Pounds
3,380.
Single premium bonds
These are lump sum investments that are not 'qualifying', so higher-rate tax
will be charged where applicable. The top managed fund over five years was
from Sun Life, with a return of Pounds 14,964 on an investment of Pounds
10,000.
Choice of sector is crucial. Skandia's Gartmore Hong Kong fund returned a
spectacular Pounds 37,405 after five years, more than trebling the initial
investment, while MGM's special situations fund returned just Pounds 4,950
for the same period, less than half of the initial outlay.
Charges are less of an issue with single premiums because this structure
avoids the high up-front deductions associated with regular premium plans.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Now you pay more to insure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Protecting your assets becomes more expensive this weekend, with the new
insurance premium tax of 2.5 per cent coming into force today.
It will be noticed most by motorists and those buying buildings and home
contents cover, but it applies to all general policies including travel
insurance and the employment protection cover often sold in conjunction with
loans and credit cards.
It also includes contracts which may not normally be thought of as
insurance, such as extended warranties on electrical goods and membership of
breakdown recovery services like the AA and RAC.
While tax does not apply to long-term products, like life insurance or most
kinds of permanent health insurance, it will hit private medical insurance.
A handful of insurers - including the Prudential and Pearl - have announced
they will absorb the cost rather than pass it on to their customers. But
this could be short-lived: no insurer has committed itself to absorbing the
tax for more than the first year and some people in the industry fear it
could be increased in next month's Budget.
In other EC countries, the tax can be as high as 30 per cent on some types
of insurance, although a more normal level is 5 to 10 per cent.
Research by AA Insurance has found that UK motor insurance premiums rose on
average by less than 0.5 per cent between July and October, rather than at
least 2.5 per cent, as might have been expected. So, although most insurers
are passing on the cost of the tax, underlying premiums are falling for
other reasons - which almost cancels out the effect of the new levy.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Annuities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER QUINTON, of the Annuity Bureau
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The average annual inflation rate over the past decade stands at 5.25 per
cent, so August's 2.4 per cent might appear relatively low, writes Peter
Quinton, of the Annuity Bureau. But those approaching retirement need to
consider the most effective way to protect annuity income against inflation.
Some protection can be achieved by choosing an escalating annuity. This
guarantees a selected annual increase of 3 per cent, 5 per cent, 8.5 per
cent (which can be subject to Inland Revenue restrictions) or,
alternatively, in accordance with the retail prices index.
A comparison with last week's table listing level annuity rates shows the
first year's payments for escalating annuities is considerably lower.
Over time, however, income will outstrip what would be achieved through a
level annuity - particularly if the annuitant anticipates living beyond the
average life expectancy - 78 for a man aged 65 and 82 for a 65-year old
female.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Tighter tax rules for immigrants - A
look at the implications for would-be settlers, and those in the UK already
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID FREEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Changes to UK immigration rules, announced earlier this year, are
implemented today and will have a significant effect on those wanting to
move to the UK.
When the changes (see box at right) were announced, the government was
accused by some critics of 'selling the right to live here'. Its response
was to claim it was simply encouraging investment.
But one side-effect of the changes has become apparent already - the
significant tax consequences for many of the people the government says it
is trying to attract.
As well as affecting those planning to come to the UK, the changes could
affect those already in the country. Many people have to renew their
residence visas from time to time. And where the renewal is treated as a new
application, the approach taken by the immigration authorities could change.
The best way to demonstrate the practical effect of the changes is by way of
example:
Hassan, a man of
independent means
Imagine a successful businessman from the Middle East, Hassan, who has
interests in various countries. Having built up his business over a period
of 30 years, he decides at age-51 that he wants to retire early and move to
the UK with his wife and young family.
In the past, he would have applied to go to the UK as a man of independent
means. He would have had to show that he had some connection there - perhaps
a house, or regular holidays and business connections - together with assets
of more than Pounds 200,000. In all probability, he would have been given
the right to live there on condition he did not work.
From today, that is no longer the case - because of his age. Only people
over 60 will be able to go to the UK under the new independent means rules.
One of the advantages of the independent means rules was that there was no
obligation to take any fixed amount to the UK. Had Hassan made the
application before today, he could have organised his tax and financial
affairs to ensure he kept his UK tax to a absolute minimum - perhaps even to
zero.
Hassan, the investor
Since he is too young to move to the UK as a man of independent means,
Hassan might investigate the possibility of going as an 'investor'.
If he can show that he has Pounds 1m, and is prepared to invest Pounds
750,000 of it in government bonds or shares, he should be all right.
Suddenly, though, Hassan finds he needs two sets of advice - first, on how
to make the immigration application and, second, on the tax consequences of
the promises he is making. For instance:
He will have to be careful about how he takes his money into the UK - it is
possible the Inland Revenue could treat him as being resident because of
past visits. It would be unfortunate if he was taxed because of this. Once
the money is in the UK, he will have to invest it. The income from this will
be taxed in the same way it would be for anyone else. He will need to submit
tax returns (although, as a man of independent means, he could avoid this if
he arranged his affairs carefully).
The tax authorities will want to see if the income from his UK investments
is enough to support Hassan and his family in the style to which they have
become accustomed.
If the Revenue is not convinced that the investment income is enough for
this purpose, and Hassan continues with an up-market life-style, he might
need to prove where he is getting the extra resources to do so. But with
care, and by following the rules, he should pay tax only on UK-generated
income.
What is clear is that Hassan's life in the UK is going to be rather more
complicated than it would have been as a man of independent means. The
Revenue will be in contact with him or his accountants every year when his
tax return is completed.
The new rules are not good for Hassan, and he will have to decide if he
wants to wait until he reaches 60 before applying to go to the UK as a man
of independent means, or accept the restrictions that will be imposed upon
him as an investor.
Omar, a sole
representative
Having been successful in his business abroad, Omar might be asked by his
company to be its sole representative in the UK. Under the old immigration
rules, he would have had to pay tax on his salary like anyone else, but the
company would have been outside the UK tax net.
From today, Omar's company must register a branch or subsidiary if he is to
be its representative. It will then have a UK tax profile - which it might
not want.
Hassan, the businessman
Hassan might decide he does not wish to be a man of independent means and
wants to carry on working. So, he could consider setting up a business in
the UK.
The rules about this have not changed significantly; the minimum amount of
money required to be invested in a business remains only Pounds 200,000,
which must be held in the name of the person moving to the UK rather than,
say, in trust or in another company. The disadvantage for Hassan is that, if
he dies prematurely, it will be taxed under UK inheritance tax rules.
The subtle changes to the immigration rules undoubtedly will make the
arrangements for would-be immigrants more complicated. Never before has
immigration and tax planning become so inter-linked.
Still, with careful planning, the many tax advantages available to people
from abroad will remain.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Best buys for the brokers - Bethan
Hutton considers the progress of investment trusts launched this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors have been spoilt for choice with investment trust issues: about 50
new ones have appeared in the past 12 months, plus dozens of conversion
share issues from existing trusts. And investors have poured money
enthusiastically into them: new trusts have raised Pounds 5bn since January
1993 and existing ones another Pounds 1bn-plus. But what has happened to
them since launch?
Bristol-based financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown last week polled four
leading investment trust brokers. It asked if they would buy, sell or hold
each of the 170 different investment trust shares and warrants issued since
the beginning of last year.
About 90 per cent of the stocks were rated 'hold' - which was to be
expected, given the usual advice to buy investment trusts for the medium to
long term. But three were recommended particularly as buys: EFM Small
Companies, Mercury World Mining and Mercury European Privatisation.
One reason given for choosing them was the brokers' high opinion of the fund
managers - always an important consideration. Also, all three are trading
well below their highs and are, therefore, seen as good value although
Mercury World Mining is still at a slight premium.
The most interesting sell recommendation was 3i, the giant venture capital
trust floated this summer. It went from a discount of 13 per cent at launch
to a premium of nearly 7 per cent, and its share price gained more than 20
per cent, although it has since dropped back a little. The brokers felt the
trust's premium was not justified and that other venture capital trusts
trading at wide discounts were better value.
Other sell recommendations were dominated by high-yielding trusts - Johnson
Fry Utilities, Lazard High Income, Abtrust High Income, Gartmore British
Income and Growth - which the brokers felt had become too expensive.
Private investors are often reluctant to part with a share which has done
well for them. But Mike Scott, of Hargreaves Lansdown, says that when a
trust has achieved in a few months the performance you expected over 18 or
24, it could be time to sell.
He points to Fleming Chinese (see graph), which was launched last year.
Initial subscribers who sold at the high reached not long after launch could
have made handsome profits. Those who held on have seen the value of their
shares eroded to below issue price - although that could present a buying
opportunity for new investors or those who sold at the peak.
'New issues can be particularly volatile, especially specialist trusts which
can throw up some very good trading opportunities,' says Scott. 'In some
cases, investors are presented with an early opportunity to take profits on
a new issue because shares have been driven to large premiums, or markets in
which they invested have soared in the short term.'
But this has been rare in recent months - very few new issues are trading at
above launch price (the main exception is the four new Latin American
trusts). So, although you should be prepared to sell early if the
opportunity arises, it is still important to invest only if you are prepared
to hold a trust over the long term.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY: First-half pre-tax profits from Bilton, the property investment,
construction and house-building group, are expected to come in at around
Pounds 9m, broadly the the same as last year.
TUESDAY: Ibstock, the building materials group, is expected to report a
return to the black for the first half of its year. Profits between Pounds
2m and Pounds 2.75m are forecast. This result will compare with losses of
Pounds 17.1m at the interim stage last time. The dividend is forecast to be
maintained at 0.5p.
TUESDAY: Final results from Raine, the construction group, are likely to
produce pre-tax profits in a range between Pounds 13m and Pounds 13.5m,
compared with Pounds 10.8 last year. A maintained dividend of 3p is
forecast.
WEDNESDAY: Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman of Hewden Stuart, can be relied on
to give an insight into the state of the construction industry when he
reports the group's interim results. The Glasgow-based company is the UK's
biggest independent plant hire group and is involved in every sector, from
housebuilding to roads and industrial projects.
Analysts expect a sharp increase in pre-tax profits for the six months to
July 31, from Pounds 9.1m to about Pounds 13.5m. Interest will focus on the
trading outlook and what returns have been made from the Hireplant assets of
BET - 24,000 items of plant and 29 freehold properties which Hewden Stuart
snapped up for a mere Pounds 11m last year.
WEDNESDAY: The stock market expects Bank of Scotland to show a strong rise
in pre-tax profits when it reports its interim results. Analysts' forecasts
are clustered closely around the Pounds 200m mark, up from Pounds 117.6m a
year earlier. Earnings per share are expected to be about 10p.
The market reckons on an interim dividend of 2.1p, up from 1.87p a year ago
but still giving one of the lowest dividend yields in the banking sector.
THURSDAY: Etam, the fashion retailer, is expected to deliver an increase of
more than 50 per cent in profits to Pounds 3.7m for the first half of its
year. The company's strategy of defending margins in the face of heavy
discounting by rival fashion retailers is thought to be paying off.
Shares in the group, which is weighted heavily towards the second half, have
risen from the year's low of 217p in April to well over 300p.

<TEXT>
Biggest sale of the week came at Scottish newsagent and retailer John
Menzies where the chairman, also John Menzies, sold 420,000 shares at 580p
and Charles Ramsey, a non-executive director, disposed of 86,400 at the same
price. The sale leaves both with very large chunks of stock - Menzies with
more than 5m shares and Ramsey more than 2.3m.
Mosaic Investments is responsible for licencing many of the cartoon
characters featured on children's lunch boxes, toys and clothes. Ken
Robinson, the director in charge of packaging consumables, has acquired
100,000 shares at 26p, which increases his holding by about 20 per cent.
International Business Communications provides information services to
professional newsletters and magazines. Over the past 12 months, its share
price has risen by more than 57 per cent compared with the market. Donald de
Groot is a non-executive director and his sale represents a considerable
chunk of his holding - although this would not appear to be anything more
than a timely spot of profit-taking.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Gold regains some of its glitter -
Kenneth Gooding examines why the price has moved back towards Dollars 400
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gold bulls must be cursing Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth
Clarke. Last weekend, he suggested that the International Monetary Fund
should sell some of its gold, which earns no interest, and use the proceeds
to help heavily-indebted poor countries.
Clarke's unhelpful remarks came at a time when gold had been making a
determined move towards Dollars 400 a troy ounce, a level it reached briefly
just over a year ago, and when the market was getting over its fear that big
sales from central bank hoards would crush the gold price again.
The latest rally started in August when a number of US financial
organisations, familiar faces in the market, started to buy gold in an
aggressive - but carefully controlled - manner obviously intended to drive
the price towards the Dollars 400 level.
If anyone asked about their renewed interest in gold, the reasons also
sounded very familiar: they said US interest rates were going up and worries
about global inflation were spreading.
Various financial instruments were sold to investors on the strength of the
rally and a great deal of money will be made if the gold price goes above
Dollars 400 and stays there for any reasonable length of time. 'There is a
huge, collective wish for the price to go through Dollars 400,' says Andy
Smith, analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland.
Smith says the gold market has changed dramatically from the heady days of
the late 1970s and early 1980s when investors in the rich western countries
were buying physical gold. Today, most physical gold-buying comes from the
Middle East and the Far East, markets that are much more sensitive to price
changes.
Nor, says Smith, is the market mood the same as in the early months of last
year when speculative activity was backed by a surge in physical gold-buying
because the price had dropped to Dollars 330 and the metal was perceived to
be cheap. The best that can be said about demand for physical gold at
present is that it remains steady.
The Gold Fields Minerals Services consultancy organisation reported in its
latest market update that, in contrast to the strong start in 1993,
estimates for the first half of this year implied that gold fabricators
(mainly jewellery makers) had bought 12 per cent less metal, or 1,400
tonnes.  This is slightly misleading, however, because of exceptionally
heavy demand in the first quarter of 1993, with China at the forefront.
GFMS, which is backed financially by some big gold producers, summed up by
saying: 'The prospects for gold look very delicately balanced, and a good
argument can be made for suggesting that the price will break out of the
recent trading range, either on the upside or the downside, depending on the
interplay between wealth creation, inflation, interest rates and, finally,
perceptions about gold's fundamentals.'
Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services group,
says he is sceptical about a 'break out on the upside' being sustainable for
long. And he is puzzled by suggestions that inflation will push the gold
price ever upwards.
'History does not show that happening, nor does an objective reading of
likely trends in real interest rates in coming months,' says Arnold.
'For gold to perform really well in an inflationary environment, one would
have to have negative rates of return on money and a desire on the part of
investors to physically buy and hold gold.
'I can't see a return to this situation in the foreseeable future.'
What the gold bulls seem to overlook, adds Arnold, is that 'major structural
changes in both supply and demand have reduced the volatility of the gold
market. Both supply and demand now respond much quicker to a given price
rise than in the past.'
One accessible route into gold for private investors is through a unit or
investment trust. 'Gold has been a very unfashionable investment,' says
Julian Baring, fund manager of Mercury Gold and General, the top-performing
commodity unit trust in the five, three and two years to August 1 (HSW,
offer-to-bid; net income re-invested). 'But if you compare the performance
of gold against US shares, it would not take much of a fall in the Dow Jones
index or a rise in the gold price to break a 13-year bear trend.'

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Caught in the log-jam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tony Bevan would have been happier if he had never heard of Coloroll. But
his employer, Mills Associates, a Monmouth-based computer data processor,
decided to shut down its pension scheme in June 1990 - just one month after
the historic Barber judgment - and he was trapped.
With more than 25 years' service in the company scheme, Bevan was alarmed to
discover that his future pension was entangled in a legal process that
extended from Monmouth to Luxembourg, home of the European Court of Justice.
Only now, more than four years later, will Bevan find out just how much his
pension benefits are worth - and be able take control of the money to invest
in a pension plan of his choice.
'The worst part has been the endless delays and not knowing who to go to for
help,' he says. 'We have been passed from pillar to post and, finally, our
concern over the fund value led us to appoint a firm of consulting actuaries
to investigate on our behalf.'
In Bevan's case, the delays were nothing to do with his employer and
everything to do with a tortuous pensions system. Late in the 1980s, and
despite its generous benefits, the final salary scheme at Mills Associates
was attracting few new members because of the massive publicity promoting
personal pension plans. When it became uneconomic to maintain the scheme,
the company decided to close it and advised members to take out personal
pensions.
Unlike many employers in this position, however, Mills Associates continued
to pay substantial contributions into employees' individual plans.
When the scheme was closed it had 70 members, excluding pensioners. Of
these, only 25 were still employed by Mills Associates; the rest had changed
jobs and left their pension benefits behind.
The company scheme was run by Legal &amp; General, which advised members to sit
tight until the outcome of the Coloroll case was known. If the court
decision on Wednesday had led to extra costs, the scheme would have been
obliged to adjust members' benefits.
In the interim period, several members reached retirement age and,
naturally, wanted to draw their pensions. Legal &amp; General agreed to pay
these, but at a reduced rate.
Bevan, meanwhile, tried to accelerate the wind-up. As he explains: 'The
Occupational Pensions Board didn't clear the scheme until 1992, and then the
Department of Social Security took ages to complete its examination due to
what appears to be a permanent backlog. We tried the pensions ombudsman and
the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service, but they said they could do
nothing to speed things up. We then discovered that the average time it
takes to wind up a scheme is four to five years - and this has nothing to do
with the Coloroll case.'
For Bevan and his colleagues, the long wait is over at last. Legal &amp; General
confirmed that the effect of the court's decision is negligible on the Mills
Associates scheme and that the funds are ready to distribute. Once the
actuaries finish their investigation, members will receive their benefits -
including back payments to pensioners who had received a reduced rate since
1990.
Footnote: Some schemes waiting to wind up following the Coloroll ruling will
have good news for members. Where a scheme has a surplus of funds, and once
the extra costs imposed by Coloroll are met, it can use the balance to
increase members' benefits. In the case of the British Shipbuilders' pension
scheme, run by Legal &amp; General, the surplus is Pounds 50m.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Part-timers given hope over pensions
 -A look at this week's European Court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, the European Court of Justice told employers how they should
equalise pensions for men and women. In doing so, it raised the hopes of
thousands of part-time women workers who may now be able to join their
company schemes and back-date their pension claims for up to 20 years.
The court also made clear, however, that women members are powerless to
prevent their employers from raising the age at which they can claim a full
pension from 60 to the male pension age, 65. This means that women may have
to work and pay pension contributions for an extra five years.
Wednesday's announcement by the court also will affect those with present
and future pension rights in a scheme that is due to be wound up because the
employer has gone bust. These people should now receive their benefits after
a wait of up to four years (see other stories on this page).
What is unequal about pensions?
Under most scheme rules women could, until recently, claim a full pension at
age-60. This meant that the value of a year's pensionable service for women
was higher than for men.
What does the law say?
The concept of equal pensions for men and women in equal employment is
enshrined in European Union law. Under the Treaty of Rome (1957), on which
the modern EU is founded, employers may not discriminate between men and
women in pay and benefits.
Until 1990, though, employers thought pay did not include pensions. On May
17 1990, in a case known as Barber v GRE, the court ruled that pensions were
part of pay and must be equal. A later case said that equal pensions could
not be backdated pre-Barber.
How did employers react to the Barber case?
Quickly and ingeniously. To avoid the cost of paying men full pensions from
age-60, most employers raised the female pension age by five years.
Isn't this unfair?
Many women thought so, as did the Equal Opportunities Commission which
backed a case brought by five women who worked for Avdel systems, a
Hertfordshire engineering company. In Wednesday's ruling on Avdel, the court
said employers did have the right to raise the female pension age.
But, in another ruling, the court said that the trustees of the pension
schemes of Coloroll, a UK wallpaper and home furnishings group that
collapsed in 1990, must apply equal pensions in the absence of the employer.
This means that men in the Coloroll schemes can now claim the higher female
rate for each year of pensionable service in the period between May 1990 and
the date the company collapsed.
What about part-timers?
The court said that barring part-timers from a company scheme - where most
of these employees are women - would be discriminatory. Moreover, it ruled
that this issue had nothing to do with the Barber case but was confirmed by
another case in 1976. Therefore, women could back-date their claim almost 20
years.
Andrew Powell of legal firm Hammond Suddard, which specialises in pensions,
suggests this action plan for scheme members:
Check if the majority of part-timers excluded from the scheme are women.
Work in a group rather than as individuals and, where possible, ask a trade
union to co-ordinate any claim - which might also apply to women who have
left employment or the dependants of any who died while in part-time
employment.
Check the cost involved in back-dating a claim. The court said that
employees as well as employers must make back payments - can you afford
this?
Are the benefits worth it? Most schemes do not pay pension for the first
tier of earnings - typically, Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4,500 but sometimes
more.
Ask the pensions manager and/or trustees for the objective reasons on which
they rely for their exclusion policy.
If the reasons are unsatisfactory, seek help - you could be entitled to
legal aid (see 'Who can help' in column seven).

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Protecting your rights when a scheme
closes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's European Court decision on equal pensions will trigger 'a tidal
wave of scheme wind-ups', according to Richard Whitelam, a partner with
consulting actuary Bacon &amp; Woodrow. Most of these schemes will belong to
companies that became insolvent after May 1990 - the date of the Barber case
 -and have been waiting for this latest judgment to find out how to share
the funds among members.
The judgment means that if the scheme rules allowed women to claim a full
pension from a lower age than males, then the men should be able to boost
their benefits by claiming the same rights for the period between May 1990
and the date of insolvency - up to four years, in some cases.
Whitelam warns, however: 'Problems will arise where there is not enough
money in the pension fund to cover its liabilities. In these cases, the
men's new rights must be taken into account before all the pensions are
scaled down.'
Equal pension rights apart, winding up a pension scheme is a lengthy and
complex procedure and it is important to know your rights.
Whatever the circumstances, your pension benefits should be safe because the
law states that a pension fund must be held in a trust that is separate
legally from the company's own funds.
On wind-up, a well-run scheme should have adequate funds to cover present
and future pensions. Unfortunately, the wind-up can reveal a shortfall, as
happened at ship-builder Swan Hunter where the actuaries under-estimated the
cost of buying out the scheme's liabilities and had to reduce the benefits
of members who had not yet retired by up to 40 per cent.
Even where there is no reason to suspect foul play, there can be endless
delays that cause anxiety during wind-up, as Tony Bevan discovered (see
'Caught in the log-jam').
***
It is important to keep in touch with the scheme's trustees; they are there
to look after your rights and tell you about any changes that are taking
place. But remember that you cannot always rely on trustees if, for example,
they include members of the work force who were made redundant before a
take-over or privatisation. A trade union contact can prove helpful in these
circumstances.
The way a scheme is wound up depends on its trust deed and rules - the legal
foundation on which schemes are based. The trustees should consult a legal
adviser and, in the case of insolvency, appoint an independent trustee - a
professional whose job is to protect members' benefits.
It is worth asking this trustee how long it will take to wind up the scheme,
since this can drag on for up to five years depending on the complexity of
the case, how the fund is invested, and how many government departments are
involved.
This can lead to a period of delays during which you might not be able to
transfer your benefits to a new scheme or, in the case of retired members,
be paid a full pension. If, when the process is complete, there is a fund
shortfall, your benefits may be reduced.
If, on the other hand, there is a surplus, you might receive a better
pension than expected. Whatever the circumstances you should stay put until
your position is clear.

On wind-up, the Inland Revenue insists that your pension money is invested
in another scheme or plan until retirement. In most cases, the trustees will
arrange a 'bulk purchase annuity' with a life office; this guarantees the
same or similar benefits to members as those offered by the original scheme.
You could also have the option of transferring your former company benefits
into a new company scheme or a personal pension plan. Expert help is
essential here to make sure you are getting good value for money.
Bear in mind that most company schemes provide lump sum death insurance and
pensions for dependants. Check that your new arrangement covers these family
protection benefits.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Gilt auction success - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices of UK government stock - gilt-edged - continued generally weak,
partly because of the fall in US Treasury bonds on Thursday. But earlier in
the week the government's Pounds 2bn gilt auction had drawn an unexpectedly
strong response. Demand was much as predicted. But an unusually large
proportion of the stock on offer went to long term investors - life
insurance companies and pension funds. And some market-makers had to
scrabble round buying stock after the auction. In the end the Bank of
England had to sell them some.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Investors favour UK equity income
funds - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Investment in unit trusts last month rose to a net Pounds 773m from Pounds
646m in July but it was below August 1993's net investment of Pounds 981m.
Private investors accounted for 55 per cent of the total with UK equity
income funds as their favourite. The Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds, which released the figures, said that the number of
unitholder accounts crossed the 6m threshold for the first time, to 6.04m.
The figure has risen by one-third since January 1992 against a background of
low interest rates, as private investors have turned to equity-related
products in the search for better returns than in the building society.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets: Turning on the optimism - Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Gas' 2m shareholders have been 'amused and bemused, but not
rebellious' in recent years as they watched their company struggle against a
rising tide of regulatory pressure to abolish its monopoly markets in the
UK.
That was the view of Richard Giordano, British Gas chairman, last Thursday
as he and other senior executives set out the company's future dividend
policy and corporate strategy to City analysts.
Shareholders may also have been 'confused,' given the contradictory signals
which the company has been sending to the market of late.
At Thursday's presentation, the first such strategy session in many years,
Giordano said the regulatory fog of the last three years had lifted enough
to offer a coherent view of business prospects to the end of the decade.
The view, although not entirely rosy, was generally positive. And the
management was confident enough to give an assurance that as long as there
were no 'untoward regulatory shocks,' British Gas should be able to increase
future dividends, as well as finance its business strategy in a prudent
manner.
The optimistic statement was in sharp contrast to two dividend warnings
issued earlier this year. Most analysts believe those expressions of deep
pessimism had more to do with the company's political lobbying effort than
with underlying business conditions.
But the uncertainty they engendered among shareholders and analysts alike
was one of the factors behind the recent under-performance of British Gas
shares.
'Shareholders can sleep more easily now after a disturbed summer of scary
comments from the company,' said Simon Flowers, an analyst with Natwest
Markets in Edinburgh.
That view is shared by other analysts, although there is still uncertainty
over whether the 'progressive' dividend policy announced by the company will
result in real increases.
Paul Spedding, of London brokers Kleinwort Benson, says the new dividend
policy means that, 'at worst, British gas shares will be equivalent to an
index-linked gilt.'
He says the company's decision to shift its dividend policy from one based
on earnings to a new formula linked to cash flow will allow it to 'hold the
dividend in real terms.'
But it is not clear how much scope the company will have for real increases.
Flowers says his calculations suggests there should be some room for real
growth in coming years. Under the new cash formula, last year's dividend
would have been covered 3.6 times. Natwest forecasts suggest the cash
dividend cover will be four times by 1996-97 well within the lower limit set
by British Gas.
Much depends on the success of the current restructuring programme, in which
the company is aiming to reduce its annual cost base by Pounds 600m by 1998,
largely through the elimination of 25,000 jobs, a third of the workforce.
Another big factor will be the pace at which earnings are boosted by the
company's rising oil and gas production profile, the main engine for
earnings growth to the end of the decade, according to company officials.
The generally upbeat tone of Thursday's presentation suggests that the
company has also reassessed the likely impact of the government's decision
to introduce full competition into the domestic gas market by 1998, when
consumers will also be able to choose between different electricity
suppliers.
Although British Gas is likely to lose a healthy slice of the domestic
market to its would-be rivals, analysts say there is a good chance that the
government might agree to delay the phased introduction of competition from
1996 to 1997.
That would give the company more breathing space in which to create a
commercially-oriented business unit able to compete head-to-head with the
independents.
Although it is bound to lose market share, British Gas will remain the
monopoly transporter of gas to 18m households, a function which accounts for
about half the retail cost of gas.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets: Equities still in thrall to bond markets - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just how quickly is the American economy recovering? That may seem an odd
preoccupation for the UK equity market, but it was the dominant concern
during a week in which traders and investors remained in thrall to the
international bond markets.
The FT-SE 100 sank below the 3,000 mark amid fears that the rapid pace of US
growth might cause the Federal Reserve to put up interest rates again, which
would increase pressure for another rise in UK borrowing costs.
All eyes were fixed on Wednesday's meeting of the Fed's Open Market
Committee. Shares shed 20 points in the preceding two days, but then
recovered when the meeting passed without any rise. However, Thursday's news
of an upward revision in American growth rates - plus a 9.7 per cent leap in
August's new house sales in the US - was enough to wipe 46.2 points off the
FT-SE 100 index.
Bond traders are concerned that resumed over-rapid growth could lead to
inflation, and indeed the rapid increase in commodity prices illustrated by
the chart gives some grounds for concern. Yet there was little in this
week's corporate results to suggest that retail prices are on the up -
particularly in the housing market.
Shares in Tarmac, Britain's second largest housebuilder, fell after the
group said house sales had halved during the two weeks since UK interest
rates rose by a half percentage point.
However, shares in Beazer Homes rose after the fourth largest housebuilder
said that sales had risen by a fifth since July 1 and had not been dented by
the recent rise in interest rates. Victor Benjamin, Beazer's chairman, said:
'While it is too early to evaluate the outcome of the recent interest rate
increase, we believe that in the current market it is uncertainty over
interest rates rather than the actual rate which unsettles consumer
confidence.'
One place where housebuilding continues to thrive is Germany. Redland, the
British building materials group, said it would seek a Frankfurt stock
exchange listing after announcing a 40 per cent rise in German profits in
the first half of this year. The group has so far seen no sign of slackening
in demand in Germany, where sales have been boosted by repairs to homes in
the east and the accommodation demands from large numbers of immigrants to
the west.
UK retailers also reported little scope to increase prices, in spite of
improved sales level. Sears, which owns the London department store
Selfridges and the Dolcis shoe chain, expects the economy to continue a
steady but slow improvement. House of Fraser, which owns department stores
around the country, said sales in September had recovered strongly after a
poor August. It said the recent rise in UK interest rates had produced no
marked effect but warned that a further rise could be damaging.
One bright spot for beleaguered parents came with the news from Sears that
its Olympus sports chain had suffered a dip in sales. Apparently youth
fashion has moved away from trainers.
Consumers can also expect more bargains in the bookshops soon, following the
decision by Hodder Headline to become the second publisher to leave the
voluntary agreement that allows publishers to set minimum prices for most
books for six months after publication. Reed Books, the publishing arm of
Reed Elsevier, already publishes its books 'non-net' and says market share
has increased as a result.
Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the publisher of illustrated reference books,
said it was disappointed by this latest blow to the agreement. It believed
the agreement's abandonment would result in the closure of smaller,
independent bookshops and the availability of fewer titles.
The biggest deal of the week came from Reckitt &amp; Colman which put its
mustard business up for sale to help finance a drive to become one of the
world's leading suppliers of lavatory cleaners and other household products.
Reckitt announced the Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 980m) purchase of L &amp; F
Household, a leading US supplier of household products, from Eastman Kodak,
and offered for sale Colman's mustard and Robinson's barley water.
Sir Michael Colman, chairman and last family member in the business founded
five generations ago in a Norwich mill, said it was a difficult decision to
sell Colman's. But he believed the business would be better run by a group
with a strong food strategy now that Reckitt was concentrating on
disinfectants, cleaners, air fresheners and insecticides.
The market rallied sharply yesterday afternoon and the FT-SE 100 ended the
week comfortably above the 3,000 mark. However, the outlook for the fourth
quarter's trading, starting on Monday, remains uncertain.
The broker S G Warburg argues that the pressure on bonds is coming from
stronger than expected growth around the world, which points to a bullish
environment for equities on any strategic view. However, it concedes that
'the strong growth in analysts' estimates (which remain solid this autumn)
needs to be set against the prospect of continued uncertainty in bonds over
the next 12 months.'
Warburg has accordingly cut its year-end FT-SE 100 forecast from 3,500 to
3,250 - 'a more plausible central assumption,' in view of the lack of
investor confidence in the bond markets. Warburg now reckons that the 3,500
mark will not be reached before the end of 1995.
The unsettled trading of the past week - which saw low volumes and few
significant corporate results - demonstrates that UK equities remain
vulnerable to any tightening of interest rates. It is for this reason that
the most significant item in most traders diaries will be next Friday's US
employment figures.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets: Waiting for Greenspan to hit the brakes - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of the Federal Reserve's decision this week not to put up interest
rates again, Wall Street analysts are convinced that it is now a question of
when, not if, the central bank will next tighten monetary policy to slow
down the economy.
Although share prices posted solid gains for three consecutives days after
the Fed's open market committee meeting on Tuesday closed without a rate
increase, few investors, analysts or dealers believe that policy will stay
on hold for very long. Judging by the most recent data, the economy is still
growing too strongly for the Fed's liking.
Looking back, it now seems that the only reason the FOMC did not sanction a
rate rise at its meeting was that its members had no inkling of how strong
Thursday's gross domestic product and home sales statistics were going to
be. If they had known - or guessed - that second quarter GDP growth would be
revised upwards from 3.8 per cent to 4.1 per cent, and that sales of
single-family homes would jump by 9.1 per cent in August, then they would
probably have given Fed chairman Alan Greenspan an immediate green light to
raise interest rates by another 25 or 50 basis points.
The Fed's goal is to choke inflationary pressures in the economy by slowing
the rate of annual growth to about 2.5 per cent. The difference between 2.5
per cent and 4.1 per cent is just too great to be ignored, even if the data
on prices have yet to show signs of resurgent inflation.
This means that investors in stock and bond markets will have to play a
waiting game. The FOMC is not scheduled to sit again until November 15, and
although on four of the five occasions that the Fed has raised rates this
year it has done so immediately following an FOMC summit, there is nothing
to stop Greenspan from initiating a rate increase before the next FOMC
meeting.
After the Fed left policy unchanged after the July 6 FOMC gathering, it was
revealed that the committee had decided at the time to grant the Fed
chairman the freedom to raise rates in the period between FOMC meetings if
he felt it was necessary. Analysts believe that on Tuesday, Greenspan was
given similar discretionary powers.
The only question is: will the rate increase come at the end of next week,
after the September employment report is released, or will the Fed hold its
fire until the week after, when figures on inflation, retail sales,
industrial production and capacity utilisation are all due to be released?
A majority of analysts are betting that the Fed will wait until the
inflation figures are released, although very strong jobs data could trigger
an early tightening.
Either way, trading on the stock market is likely to be overshadowed in
coming weeks by fear of a rate increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
has been stuck between 3,800 and 3,900 for more than a month, and it is
difficult to see how blue-chip stocks can break up and out of that range.
It is easier to imagine a decisive, downward shift in prices, particularly
if the bond market pre-empts another Fed rate increase by sending the yield
on the benchmark 30-year bond - the most widely-followed measure of
long-term interest rates - above 8 per cent.
The 30-year yield closed this week at just over 7.8 per cent, its highest
level since June, 1992. A stronger-than-expected September jobs report would
probably push the yield up over 7.9 per cent, with signs of rising inflation
in the producer and consumer prices data, and an accompanying rate increase
from the Fed, likely to shove it through the 8 per cent mark. At that point,
sentiment in the equity market could turn nasty. An overheating economy, a
fresh tightening of monetary policy, and rising long-term interest rates
would be an unpleasant combination for stocks.
This gloomy scenario, however, does not take into account one factor that
should have a positive impact upon share prices in the next few weeks -
corporate earnings. The third quarter reporting season will begin in earnest
soon, and every indication suggests that it will be a good one for US
companies.
Sustained emphasis upon cost containment and improved efficiency, rising
consumer spending, the strong domestic economy and resurgent economies
overseas should have bolstered corporate earnings during the third three
months of the year, and are likely to do so into the final quarter.
Rate increase or no rate increase, US companies are making money, and
providing a welcome safety net for investors fearful of a large market
slide.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets: Investments that penalise the poor - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN O'CONNOR, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even Autif, the unit trust trade association, sounded rather surprised at
its own restraint this week: it is not lobbying the chancellor of the
exchequer to raise the ceilings on personal equity plans in his November
Budget. Like Sherlock Holmes' dog that failed to bark, Autif's silence
speaks volumes.
Anyone who can afford to take full advantage of the annual Pep allowance
already has a remarkably good deal. The worry must be that some future
chancellor will feel it is far too generous and reduce or remove the
concessions. For, like most tax concessions, Peps are widening the gulf
between rich and poor.
This week, the Institute for Fiscal Studies produced a research paper
pointing out that the savings of the poor tend to incur more tax than those
of the rich. This is because the poorer half of the population holds 60 per
cent of its assets in interest-bearing accounts at banks and building
societies, which are taxed comparatively heavily. But the richest part of
the population holds much of its wealth in specialised investments which
enjoy generous tax treatment, such as Peps and direct holdings of shares and
unit trusts.
Where the poor have benefited, along with the rich, is through home
ownership. But house price booms may be a thing of the past.
If this year's Budget leaves Peps alone, most investors will rejoice. But,
in the long term, would it not be better if chancellors gave up using tax to
distort investment patterns?
For a start, tax incentives hardly ever fulfil their creators' intentions.
The business expansion scheme was intended to encourage individuals to
invest in developing small businesses - and ended up sucking many people
into illiquid property investment just as the market turned down. Peps were
intended to encourage individuals to invest directly in the shares of quoted
companies, but they became a success only when they weretransformed into
vehicles for the packaged savings market.
Second, tax incentives are - as the IFS shows - of the greatest use to those
who can afford expert advice. And, finally, the search for tax-efficient
investment leads to investment that is, too often, distorted and, at worst,
just plain bad.
***
This comment from a broker seemed either cryptic or cynical: 'It's easier to
justify buying gilts on a personal finance basis than on a market basis.'
But what he meant was clear enough. The actual and probable returns on
gilt-edged stocks look attractive compared with those available elsewhere.
But most people are expecting interest rates to rise further on both sides
of the Atlantic, and gilt prices nearly always fall when interest rates
rise. So, gilts are likely to get even cheaper over the next few months.
Does this matter? Buying at the bottom and selling at the top is an
unrealistic ambition. Our table, courtesy of BZW, suggests which gilts look
most appealing at present to different types of taxpayer.
The yields show what you can actually expect to receive net of whatever your
relevant tax rate is - provided you hold them until maturity. The volatility
rating reflects the market risk: the higher the rating, the greater the
risk.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Wanted - wonder of the age: Now is the time for all good
citizens to come to the aid of the (millennium) party. But only mind-blowing
ideas will do, says Antony Thorncroft
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The countdown has started. In just over five years the world will be
celebrating, well, the party of the millennium. And if new year's eve 1999
does not go off with a suitably seismic bang, pedants, who know that the
third millennium starts at midnight on January 1 2001 can have a second
crack a year later.
The British government is among the purists. Its millennium celebrations
climax at the end of the year 2000. And it is going to be some junket: it
has set aside a possible Pounds 1.6bn to make sure that it is an event that
will be remembered for at least the next century. The joy of it all is that,
in theory, not a penny of the cost will be paid for by the government - or
the taxpayer. It is coming from that seemingly inexhaustible milch cow, the
National Lottery.
The lottery is one of John Major's footnotes in history. Margaret Thatcher,
the former premier, was implacably opposed to government sponsored gambling:
it disturbed her non-conformist soul. Major quickly recognised the inanity
of the UK being the only developed nation without a lottery and gave the
go-ahead. He has proved a reliable friend. Only last month he confirmed his
support. 'The money raised by the lottery will not replace existing
government funding - Treasury, please note.'
But if John Major is midwife to the lottery, Lord Palumbo, when chairman of
the Arts Council, is given credit for dreaming up the idea that a fifth of
all the money raised for good causes from the lottery should go into a
millennium fund. His main concern was patching up the great national
monuments, especially the cathedrals and grand mansions, as the tired old
century came to a close, in time for a fresh start in the new millennium.
The concept soon developed a momentum of its own and until the end of 2000
the millennium fund will be a power in the land. Then the other lottery
beneficiaries - the arts, the heritage, sport and charities - will subsume
its portion, and all that will be left is its legacy.
Just as the millennium fund arrived rather suddenly from nowhere so it
carries little baggage. There has been only one attempt to define its
objectives - by Peter Brooke, the former Heritage Secretary, who guided the
lottery on to the statute book. His vision was warming but woolly.
'Our millennium projects are probably going to be those that would not
otherwise happen.'
'Above all, the millennium commission's legacy should form a permanent
enhancement of our national heritage.
'We should seek to capture the spirit of our age in enduring landmarks that
symbolise our hopes for the future.'
He took as his benchmark the Great Exhibition of 1851, which bequeathed such
memorials as the Crystal Palace and the South Kensington museums, and its
dim echo, the 1951 Festival of Britain, which bequeathed the little loved
South Bank arts centre.
A few certainties about the millennium are emerging through the haze.
Undoubtedly, there will be some grandiose building projects but not nearly
as many as first envisaged, at least by the directors of our great museums
and galleries. Around half the millennium's cash will go on a dozen enduring
monuments, fairly spread across the country. The other half will be spent on
more transitory feel-good experiences which, ideally, would directly affect
the lives of as many people as possible.
The capital projects are up and running, at least in blueprint, before the
first lottery ticket has been sold (in November) and the first donations to
a good cause made, probably next June. It is already apparent that some
highly fancied schemes will be turned down by the millennium fund
commissioners, a nine-strong band of the Great and the Good.
They are not inclined to help Covent Garden in its Pounds 100m rebuilding
appeal: that is a decision for the Arts Council lottery staff. They are
unimpressed by a proposal for a great national sports stadium in Manchester:
that is for the Sports Council to consider. They are worried by schemes that
involve the refurbishment of existing buildings, like the British Museum's
Pounds 100m plan to enclose its inner court yard: perhaps the National
Heritage Fund could help here.
The millennium fund ideally wants new buildings, and mind-expanding ones at
that, something on the lines of the Crystal Palace of 1851 or its pipsqueak
1951 successor, the Skylon. It is unwilling to provide money when there are
already established institutions which exist to help. But it will provide
endowment funds, so that anything really innovative that emerges does not
have to struggle to survive. Who knows the UK might have the finest equipped
rock stadium in the world in five years, or a technology museum which places
foreign science parks back in the Dark Ages.
It is hard to find current projects which are copper-bottomed certainties
for millennium aid. For example, Cardiff Opera House is a strong candidate.
Wales must have one big millennium building, geography dictates that. Wales
is the land of song; Cardiff Bay is trying to regenerate itself; and the
local arts mafia has got its act so organised that it has already chosen an
architect, Zaha Hadid, on the basis of her challenging design.
The only doubt over Cardiff Opera House is not that the proposed gigantic
glass building will appear too 20th century modernist, and therefore dated,
for the commissioners, but that they decide that the Welsh Office, or the
local council, or commercial developers, are already in place to fund such a
development. Who is to say that opera houses might not be old hat in the
21st century?
Another strong contender is the South Bank Centre in London. It has asked
Richard Rogers, one of the most fashionable architects of the day, to come
up with ideas and he has proposed a semi-translucent umbrella to cover the
existing faded buildings. A nationally sensitive site, with memories of past
celebrations; a big name architect; plus the opportunity to hold the
millennium festival there, that the commissioners might think essential to
celebrate the big year - the South Bank looks a good bet.
As does the Tate Gallery of Modern Art on Bankside. Perhaps it is too near
the South Bank for comfort, but the UK lacks a national gallery of modern
art and we are supposed to be looking forward in 2000. This may enable the
commissioners to forget that the Tate is planning to move into an existing
building, the old Bankside power station, much of which will be retained.
The fact that the Tate has been quick off the mark, and is likely to be able
to raise perhaps half the Pounds 80m needed from its own resources, may sway
the commissioners, who expect big projects to conjure up some matching
funding.
None of these buildings, currently the fancied runners, really lifts the
imagination. It is hard to think that many people a century from now will
look at them in awe and regard or consider the 1990s as an age of Titans.
None compares to the Eiffel Tower in terms of pretension, or the Statue of
Liberty in terms of moral statement. None will take its place as a Wonder of
the World.
Oddly the most ambitious millennium project announced to date, the Pounds
150m Albertopolis plan for a regenerated museum village in South Kensington,
looks like an early casualty, with one important participant hiving off to
do its own thing, a pedestrian piazza linking the Hall with the Albert
Memorial. Along with the London opera houses and museums, Albertopolis is
likely to lose out to such regional ventures as a rehabilitated flour mill
in Gateshead, which aims to be the contemporary art centre of the north
east; or the Lowry Museum in Lancashire; or the proposed National Gallery of
Scottish art.
Here again there is nothing of real splendour. Anyone contemplating a giant
platinum pyramid, an awesome bridge, or an inter-denominational
cathedral-mosque, had better get their designs on paper quickly.
The commissioners are not really worried about the capital projects - they
feel they will emerge inexorably, even if they are not quite as
spell-binding as they would wish. What concerns them, and perhaps the
government, is engendering a feel-good factor in the public. They are
touring the country, touting ideas from local worthies. John Major came up
with one last month - a computer in every village hall in the land.
These meetings cause problems. The commissioners cannot solicit
applications: they can only offer guidelines. Most people, if asked how they
would spend Pounds 1.2bn (the commissioners are not yet accepting that the
lottery will give them Pounds 1.6bn: they are probably holding back Pounds
400m for a grand finale in 2000), would say 'devote it to cancer research,
or at least arthritis' or 'provide nursery schooling for all' or 'modernise
the transport system'. But millennium money cannot be spent on areas where
the government is already financially committed. Hence the hunt for
brilliant new ideas.
The environment is certainly in favour - plans to replant the Caledonian
Pine Forest in the Scottish Highlands, and to create parklands in derelict
inner cities, have a winning look. Technology is an acceptable buzz word,
and networks of local science centres, like that in the Smithsonian in
Washington, stand a chance. Bursaries for foreign travel and education on
the lines of the Rhodes Scholarships are obvious contenders.
But what the commissioners would really like is a mind-blowing grand idea -
like the Open University. They might have to settle for hundreds of small
ones. This village might get a clock; that a communal green. Certainly the
aim is to spread the money around the land, especially if local community
groups join in with their time, labour and perhaps a little cash.
Disused railway tracks might be brought back to life; canals might be put
back into use; Stonehenge might be turned into a national park; the
Highlands might get a university; retreats for artists and writers and
musicians might dot the land. The greening of Britain, with the planting of
millions of trees, may capture the public mood. The imagination is
encouraged to run riot.
The commissioners need help. Without the input of the people more and more
of the cash might be siphoned off on the grand proposals just because they
can afford consultants and influential appeal raisers and are ready to
start. This is the opportunity for the common man to improve his quality of
life.
The commissioners will look more kindly on plans to improve existence in
Derry rather than London. They want to reach the people and places which
have been left behind in recent years. They want to improve the image of the
nation now to future generations. Ideally, people in 2094 should be
benefiting from the expenditure of the next five years.
The FT is playing its part by asking its readers for their suggestions. They
must look forward to the next century and beyond, although no doubt the
millennium will also be used for a stock taking of the past, a modern
Domesday survey of Great Britain in the year 2000. The best ideas will
receive prizes, although not to the value of Pounds 1.6bn.

FT  01 OCT 94 / The Long View: Global growing pains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Living on the never-never has become expensive. This week, Britain's
government paid an interest rate of 8.9 per cent when it auctioned its
latest Pounds 2bn issue of 10-year gilt-edged bonds. At the present
inflation rate, the borrowing cost in real terms is 6 1/2 per cent.
No wonder share prices have been flagging in the face of such determined and
price-insensitive competition for savings; the stock market has just
tottered to the end of a grim September in which the FT-SE 100 index has
lost 8 per cent. Yet, this is not a specially British problem. The key US
long Treasury bond yield has crashed through a resistance point and is
nearing 8 per cent. In various parts of the globe, big mistakes are being
made by governments and by investors.
First, however, the good news. As the latest IMF World Economic Outlook
makes clear, the global economy is looking quite vigorous. The industrial
countries will grow at 2.7 per cent this year and the developing countries
at 6 per cent - with the emphasis on Asia where the pace is around 8 per
cent. Next year, with eastern Europe also pulling round, the global economy
is set to expand by 3.6 per cent, which would make it the best year since
1988.
Such a strong revival is a notable achievement, given the severity of the
debt crisis that has affected so many countries. The recent recession was
mild in comparison with the depressions which have plagued the global
economy periodically in the distant past. Governments have been successful
in preventing the kind of financial collapse which led to the slump of the
1930s - but the debt, instead of being wiped out, lives on.
Private sector balance sheets often remain stretched; this is the reason why
the British housing market is dead in the water. Very often, too, private
debts have simply been transformed into public sector liabilities. Saving
the Swedish banking system has undermined the Swedish government's own
creditworthiness. Too many governments have assumed they can tap an
unlimited pool of global savings, permitting them to run deficits which
cannot be financed out of domestic savings. They still have no sense of
urgency.
Last year, speculative buying of bonds by banks and hedge funds, financed by
cheap credit created by the US Federal Reserve, concealed the problem. But
that game ended abruptly last February and now Japan, the dominant source of
global savings, has been exposed as an untrustworthy link in the global
financial chain. In 1987, the time of the 'wall of money', the Japanese
bought Dollars 137bn of long-term securities, mostly dollar bonds. Up to
July this year, the corresponding total was only a net Dollars 8bn.
The Japanese government's support of a fundamentally insolvent and
notoriously opaque financial system has prevented an economic slump. But
this has allowed Japanese industry to go on pumping out goods at a loss, and
has generated a huge trade surplus and matching currency bubble. Foreign
currency losses incurred by Japanese investors in the recent past have
frightened them off investing overseas. But they are now missing a golden
opportunity to buy cheap bonds issued by overstretched western governments.
Instead, they are sitting on domestic assets while liquidity accumulates in
Japan from a trade surplus running at some Dollars 130bn a year. This has to
flow out somehow through the capital account; in fact it is largely being
recycled through central bank intervention, but into short-term money
market-type assets rather than bonds. Hence this year's apparent 'shortage'
of long-term capital.
The optimistic view would be that higher taxes, falling government deficits
and moderate economic growth will allow the imbalances to be corrected over
several years. Perhaps the rapid growth in the developing world will,
nevertheless, keep the real cost of capital relatively high. But if the
Japanese institutions buy foreign bonds again on a large scale, the value of
the yen will come tumbling down and the log-jam will have been broken, to
everyone's satisfaction.
Alternatively, there is the disaster scenario: that bond yields continue to
climb and central banks go on misinterpreting this trend as reflecting fears
of inflation. Higher interest rates will slow down the western economies,
causing budget deficits to widen again. The eventual result will be a global
breakdown of financial confidence.
To most people, the spectacle of market screens bathed in red while the
global economy is growing healthily is simply illustrative of financial
hysteria. But the markets reflect accurately the submerged financial
pressures.
A fundamental message for western governments is that the budget deficits
which they assumed would stimulate their economies will have the reverse
effect if they cannot be financed out of savings. In the UK, this boils down
to the choices facing pension funds, which are the country's largest savings
institutions but have very little new cash coming in. If they buy government
bonds, they will have to sell equities. Thus will the private sector of the
economy be crowded out. Governments should reduce their deficits and bring
down interest rates.
Higher short-term interest rates may actually make it more difficult for
governments to sell their bonds: this has become evident in the US, for
instance, where short-term savings deposits are now more attractive and
money is no longer flowing into mutual funds that invest in fixed income
securities. More radical thinking is required: the issue of yen-denominated
bonds, for instance, so that western treasuries accept the currency risk
that is being shunned by Japanese institutions.
This Black September in the securities markets has resulted from the
determination of too many governments to fight the wrong battle while facing
in the wrong direction. They still have not looked behind them.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Plan to smooth bank profits endorsed by top supervisor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A leading international banking supervisor yesterday endorsed plans by banks
to even out the swings in their reported profits caused by sharp rises in
provisions against bad and doubtful debts during recessions.
Mr Brian Quinn, executive director for financial stability at the Bank of
England, said banks should consider smoothing their profits by making
consistent provisions against loans in line with likely rates of default.
Barclays is among banks working on plans to make general provisions against
corporate loans at the time they are made, rather than waiting for signs
that borrowers are in danger of defaulting.
Mr Quinn's endorsement at a Financial Times conference on international
banking in Madrid yesterday is the strongest public backing given to the
idea by a supervisor.
He said banks should consider 'smoothing out the differences between
reported and actual profits over the life of the loan book', or
alternatively recalculating capital ratios internally to reflect likely bad
debts.
Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' chief executive, had argued that banks had
mis-reported profits during the late 1980s because they took into earnings
income from loans which they later had to write off in the recession.
UK banks have been discouraged from making large general provisions against
future bad debts because such provisions - unlike specific provisions
against troubled loans - do not attract favourable tax treatment.
Banks would find a more stable pattern of profits attractive, even if the
peaks in profitability were lowered, as shareholders would regard bank
earnings as of higher quality and consistency.
Mr Quinn said that greater stability through anti-inflationary fiscal policy
could lower banks' risks, and cost of capital, but he could not assume that
banks 'will not find other ways of digging holes for themselves'.
Speaking at the conference, Mr Eugene Ludwig, US comptroller of the
currency, said it was still hard to estimate the true value of banks'
financial derivatives in times of market turbulence.
Mr Ludwig said internal computer models, on which banks rely to value
derivatives such as swaps and options, often make different estimates of the
values of complex instruments when markets change suddenly.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Fiat to form leading car parts maker in merger: Group set
for return to profit, says chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Fiat, the Italian car and industrial holding company, announced yesterday
that it would merge Magneti Marelli and Gilardini, its components
subsidiaries, to create a company with a turnover of L5,000bn (Pounds 205bn)
which will become one of Europe's top three manufacturers of car parts.
At the same time, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, forecast that Fiat
group's consolidated gross profit for the full year could reach Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m).
'The gross consolidated profit will be between L1,000bn and Dollars 1bn, I
leave you to work out the exchange rate,' he said after the board meeting of
Ifi, the family holding company.
Last year, Fiat recorded a record loss of L1,783bn after tax, and decided
not to pay a dividend on ordinary shares for the first time since 1947.
Magneti Marelli will absorb Gilardini through an issue of new Gilardini
shares reserved for Magneti Marelli's shareholders. Gilardini will then
complete the process, which has already begun, of transferring its non-car
activities to other companies within the Fiat group.
The deal amounts to the biggest rationalisation of Fiat's activities since
the group sold its holding in Italian retailer La Rinascente a year ago as
part of a complex capital-raising exercise. But where that deal was part of
a concerted effort to pull out of the trough of recession, yesterday's
announcement came the day after Fiat published a first-half profit of L727bn
before tax.
Mr Agnelli warned that although 'the worst is past,(the situation) is still
difficult, and one shouldn't think that everything is resolved. The auto
(division) in spite of everything will still have slight losses'. He added:
'It's still too early to say if there will be dividends on Fiat ordinary
shares.'
Fiat owns some 60 per cent of Magneti Marelli and 70 per cent of Gilardini,
but the rest of the stock is quoted in Milan. Both component companies'
shares were suspended yesterday, before the announcement of the merger.
Fiat's shares, which have been among the Milan market's strongest performers
in recent weeks, fell L60 to close the day at L6,680.
Under the terms of the deal, Magneti Marelli shareholders will receive two
new Gilardini shares for every six Magneti Marelli shares held.
The deal will be put to shareholders of the two companies on November 14 or
15.
Fiat stressed yesterday that there would be no job losses at the combined
group, which will employ 23,000 people. According to a joint statement
issued by the two component companies, the enlarged Magneti Marelli will be
the market leader in Europe for dashboards instruments, and number two for
fuel injection systems, headlights and rear-view mirrors.

Indian authorities yesterday stepped up efforts to stop the spread of
pneumonic plague, while struggling to contain the economic threat posed by
the growing number of overseas travel restrictions.
The disease claimed the lives of two people in the capital, Delhi, yesterday
 -the first reported deaths outside the western city of Surat where plague
broke out last week. The deaths pushed the official death toll to more than
50, while the number of suspected plague cases rose to 2,500.
Meanwhile, officials in the capital moved to close all schools and cinemas
to prevent the plague bacteria spreading - and advised residents to cover
their faces with masks or handkerchiefs in crowded places.
The authorities' efforts have so far failed to reassure overseas governments
and visitors. KLM, the Dutch airline, said that 25-30 per cent of tourists
who had planned to travel to India by KLM this week and next had called off
their trips.
In the UK, Thomson, the largest holiday company, cancelled its Indian tours
scheduled for the first two weeks of October. Beach holidays in Goa would go
ahead, although people who decided to cancel would receive full refunds.
The move came as many Asian and Middle Eastern governments banned all
flights to and from India, and several European states imposed new medical
checks on passengers arriving from the country.
The UK health department said its plague surveillance system had identified
eight people showing flu-like symptoms 'who may be infected'. But the
Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre said later that medical tests had
cleared seven of them, while the eighth was unlikely to have the plague.
Dr Kenneth Calman, Britain's chief medical officer, said the system would
pick up more suspect cases. 'Should any cases be confirmed, they will be
treated effectively with routinely available antibiotics,' he said.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the Indian finance minister who is visiting London,
attacked countries that had imposed travel and trade restrictions on India.

A takeover of VSEL by British Aerospace, currently under discussion, would
make industrial sense. VSEL's capacity to thrive as an independent warship
manufacturer is limited. Its future hangs on winning the Royal Navy's Pounds
2.5bn contract to build the next batch of Trafalgar submarines. But it will
have a hard job convincing the Ministry of Defence that it is large enough
to bear the risks of a fixed-price contract. BAe would provide VSEL with the
necessary size. Its international reach should also help in marketing VSEL's
products overseas.
A takeover would fit in with BAe's ambitions to extend its role as a
military contractor from aviation to naval projects. So far, it has only a
small position in naval systems. But the skills it has developed in managing
complex aerospace contracts could be transferred to warships. The financial
structure of the proposed deal also has appeal. By paying with its own
shares, BAe would acquire the Pounds 320m of cash in VSEL's balance sheet
and improve its gearing. Such financial engineering would amount to a
disguised rights issue, but it should be one accomplished without a hefty
fall in its share price.
None of this means a deal will be clinched. The two companies could easily
fall out over how much VSEL is worth. And it is possible GEC may wade in and
spoil the party. That, though, looks unlikely. GEC still has ambitions to
take a bigger slice of the UK defence industry. But its main target remains
BAe, not VSEL.

Consumers are unlikely to feel the new 2.5 per cent tax on insurance
premiums which takes effect today. Premiums on some personal lines have
fallen by between 5 per cent and 25 per cent since the cyclical peak last
year. Given intensely competitive conditions in the industry, the pressure
on rates is still downwards and insurance companies will have to absorb the
tax themselves. Favourable claims experience in sectors such as theft,
weather and fire insurance over the past 2 1/2 years will also put pressure
on insurers to reduce rates further.
Fears about the sustainability of insurers' income have been the chief
factor behind the under-performance of the insurance sector during the past
year. Poor conditions in equity and bond markets, from which insurers derive
their investment income, have also soured sentiment. The sector is down
nearly 20 per cent against the market and the yield premium has climbed to
40 per cent, close to a historic high point. Only tobacco has done worse,
and that classification is dominated by BAT, a company with large insurance
interests.
This performance contrasts oddly with the record profits being generated
this year. The insurers are reaping the dual benefits of favourable claims
experience and rates which are still a long way above the last cyclical
low-point. But investors are rightly worried about the very pace of recovery
after three years of losses. The rebound is so pronounced that it has
emphasised the accelerating cyclicality of the sector.

FT  01 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For a logistics company that survives on getting goods to the right place at
the right time, the recent comings and goings at NFC have been particularly
painful. The group has now lost a chairman and chief executive within 10
weeks of each other. That said, the rapid appointment of Sir Christopher
Bland as NFC's chairman is to be welcomed. It allows him a significant role
in the most urgent problem confronting this once glamour stock - the choice
of a new chief executive. Perhaps the presentation skills that Sir
Christopher picked up at LWT will also help NFC to avoid such elementary
errors as consistently giving over-optimistic impressions of trading
performance.
The longer-term challenge is daunting. NFC suffers from lack of direction,
poor morale, and a sagging share price - down 40 per cent since this time
last year. There also seems to have been a degree of complacency among NFC's
management.
Investor disillusionment is near complete. A substantial rights issue and a
big restructuring programme have been followed by repeated profits
downgrades. If the group is to recapture investors' confidence it will need
rapidly to implement its UK restructuring programme, demonstrate some
ability to harness the economic recovery, and begin to replicate its
logistics successes in the US and continental Europe. But no matter what the
new management achieves, it will never recreate NFC's lost mystique.

FT  01 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Clinging to 3,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SG Warburg's decision to lower its year-end forecast for the FT-SE 100 index
is a salutary reminder that this looks like one of those rare years in which
equities actually fall. The consolation, after another bumpy week, was that
the market seems reluctant to hold below the 3,000 level where it yields 4
per cent. That may not be especially generous compared with a 10-year gilt
yield of 8.8 per cent. But the relationship is comfortable since the
accumulation of corporate liquidity should allow good dividend growth over
the next year or so.
The market's prospects still seem to depend more on bonds than the outlook
for earnings. For equity investors, the art thus lies in picking out
developments that would cause bonds to rally. Briefly one such moment
appeared to have been reached yesterday afternoon with reports of progress
towards a trade agreement between Japan and the US. In theory an agreement
which led the yen to weaken might stimulate capital outflows from Japan that
would re-liquify financial markets. But any trade agreement would have to be
extraordinarily convincing for that effect to last. A more plausible reason
for the market's burst of optimism was a large buy programme from a City
investment bank.
The more depressing truth is that a decisive turn in bond markets is likely
be triggered by developments that are negative for equities. Either the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates high enough to slow down the US
economy, or gilts will rally as consumer demand weakens in the UK.
Institutions inclined to put fresh money into equities at the start of the
new quarter should consider the possibility that, when equities stabilise,
it will still be bonds that out-perform.

FT  01 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Programme trading swamps
equities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
Blue chip stocks gave ground yesterday afternoon as a wave of late programme
trading swamped the market in final session of the third quarter, writes
Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 11.44 lower at 3,843.19, after
showing moderate gains for most of the session. But the more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 weathered the computer-guided selling to close up 0.48
at 462.71. Advancing issues on the Big Board led declines by a three-to-two
margin on moderate volume of 291m shares.
The secondary indices ended with solid gains. The American SE composite was
2.34 ahead at 458.81 while the Nasdaq composite added 4.95 to 764.29 on the
strength of a resurgent technology sector.
At first, the day's main economic news provided a favourable background for
institutional investors to put 'window-dressing' on their positions going
into the final three months of the year. The activity tended to favour
stocks which have performed well over the third quarter. By the end,
however, it pushed some widely held issues in the loss column.
The monthly survey of Chicago purchasing managers showed fewer manufacturers
were paying higher prices this month than last, reversing the recent trend.
With the financial markets on alert for tightening of monetary policy, the
development helped longer-dated government bonds move higher and buoyed
sentiment in the stock market in the early going, at least.
But any enthusiasm was tempered by conflicting reports on progress achieved
by US and Japanese trade negotiators, with the midnight deadline for
completing their talks fast approaching.
The Dow industrials opened in negative territory but quickly scrambled on to
the plus side, only to sag anew amid the final scurry.
Philip Morris was in particular favour. Its share price climbed Dollars 1
1/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 on reports - later confirmed - that the company was
negotiating the sale of its Kraft food-service business.
Offsetting that gain, Allied Signal dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 34 1/8
and Alcoa shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 84 3/4 .
But Chrysler added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 44 7/8 after the cash-rich car
maker revealed plans to increase its capital spending over the next five
years.
On the Nasdaq, the window-dressing plays appeared to benefit many technology
stocks, which extended their gains in the late afternoon. Among the best
performers were: Parametric Technology, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 33; DSC
Communications, Dollars 1 1/8 ahead at Dollars 28 7/8 ; and Informix,
Dollars 1 1/4 better at Dollars 27.
Canada
Toronto prices drifted mixed to lower in a quiet session, as investors kept
to the sidelines ahead of crucial economic data from the US in coming weeks.
The TSE 300 composite index was off 7.87 points, or 0.18 per cent, to close
at 4,354.18, but gainers outnumbered losers 425 to 359. Volume of CDollars
50.41m valued at CDollars 632.3m compared with 56.90m worth CDollars 789.5m
on Thursday.
Overall, eight of the 14 sub-indexes were down with one unchanged. Golds,
metals, communications and conglomerates posted the biggest declines. Brazil
Sao Paulo closed up 0.7 per cent in heavy trade despite some late
profit-taking as investors squared portfolios ahead of Monday's presidential
elections. The Bovespa index of the 55 most-active shares ended up 414 at
54,840 points.

FT  01 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich preoccupied with Swiss
Re and UBS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Market Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior bourses came cautiously, and in some cases uncomfortably, to the end
of a doubt-ridden week, writes Our Market Staff.
ZURICH was lower in heavy volume, with attention dominated by developments
at Swiss Re and at UBS, which is heading for a showdown over control with Mr
Martin Ebner and BZ Bank. The SMI index fell 23.6 to 2,534.4 taking the
week's fall to 2.9 per cent.
UBS bearers finished SFr5 lower at SFr1,200 and the registered stock lost
SFr21 to SFr303 after the bank's announcement late on Thursday that it
planned to create a single bearer share to curb the power of predators.
BK Vision, the investment company controlled by BZ Bank, fell SFr50 to
SFr1,400.
Some analysts suggested that falls in Roche certificates, SFr95 lower at
SFr5,785, Zurich Insurance, SFr51 at SFr1,170, and Ems-Chemie, SFr100 at
SFr4,060, could be attributed to expectations that Mr Ebner might soon
reduce his stakes in these companies to raise cash for the UBS battle.
However, others noted switching from Zurich Insurance into Swiss Re on the
sale of its direct insurance holdings to Allianz of Germany and Winterthur,
and plans to concentrate on reinsurance. Swiss Re, rewarded by analysts with
earnings upgrades, rose SFr49 to SFr626 but Winterthur dipped SFr5 to
SFr655.
FRANKFURT, closed for the Unity day holiday on Monday, incorporated
Thursday's post-bourse losses during the session. But it ran into more
trouble in the afternoon when the Ibis-indicated Dax index hit 1,984.65
before recovering to close 13.78 lower over 24 hours at 2,002.30, down by
4.3 per cent on the week.
Turnover rose again, from DM6.7bn to DM7.6bn, and brokers were beginning to
put some credence behind the stories of US selling. Mr Hans Peter Wodniok,
at Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, said that there were strong indications of
US selling on worries that the FDP, or German liberal party, may lose its
place in this month's polls, and that a red/green coalition could take over
from the current combination of conservatives and liberals.
At corporate level, Allianz dropped DM70 to DM2,240 following its direct
insurance acquisitions from Swiss Re. BMW recovered DM18.50 to DM752.50
after Thursday's 5.2 per cent drop following the recall of 57,000 325i
models in the US
At Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, Mr Eckhard Frahm's check on monthly
performance of the Dax constituent put a clutch of defensive stocks at the
top of the defensive charts: Schering (recovering from worries about its
product lines), Karstadt, RWE, Dresdner Bank and Viag.
Over nine months, the outperformers were cyclicals: BMW, Lufthansa, Hoechst,
Thyssen and Preussag, most of which came in for selling over the past two
days.
PARIS threatened its 1994 low, the CAC-40 index bottoming at 1,856.52 before
recovering to close 3.07 higher at 1,879.25, off 2.5 per cent on the week,
in turnover of FFr5.08bn.
Alcatel stabilised after Thursday's horrors, closing a token 60 centimes
higher at FFr489.30. The market liked the results from Paribas, Saint Louis,
and Peugeot, which rose by FFr6.80 to FFr324, FFr57 to FFr1,457, and FFr11
to FFr784 respectively.
MILAN finished lower as some disappointing interim results added to worries
that the budget could face a bumpy passage through parliament. The Comit
index fell 11.20 or 1.6 per cent to 679.77 but was still 1.6 per cent higher
over the week.
Benetton was marked L1,150 or 5.2 per cent lower at L21,000 in response to
disappointing results. Ras fell L2,200 or 8.6 per cent to L23,500 when it
was readmitted after a trading suspension on worries that the SFr1.5bn price
that it is to pay for Elvia, the Swiss insurer, was too high.
Fiat gave up L60 to L6,680 in spite of the better than expected first half
figures after the market closed on Thursday.
Among the telecoms stocks, Stet fell L119 to L4,835 and Stet gave up L75 to
L4,400 on profit taking.
AMSTERDAM was easier but off lows after reports of the US-Japanese trade
agreement as it tried out its new dealing system for the first time. The AEX
index gave up 1.64 to 402.27 for a 0.3 per cent fall on the week.
Aegon was up 20 cents at Fl 100.20 after announcing the sale of part of a UK
insurance unit to Independent Insurance Group.
Wolters Kluwer rose Fl 4.50 to Fl 123.50 and VNU lost Fl 2.50 to Fl 188.20
which, broker said, suggested switching in the stocks.
Chemicals were weak, with Akzo Nobel down Fl 3.80 at Fl 204.10 and DSM,
after two days of briefing analysts, losing Fl 4.80 at Fl 147.50.

FT  01 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Eerie parallels as Dow moves into
October - Frank McGurty is struck by similarities with 1987
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the seventh anniversary of Black Monday less a month away, at least one
influential Wall Street pundit is struck by the similarities between the
autumn investment environments of 1987 and 1994.
Throughout the late summer, when the bull market appeared to have regained
its vigour, Mr David Shulman was steadfast in his prediction that stocks
would complete a 10 to 12 per cent correction which began in February. The
Salomon Brothers analyst now is more convinced than ever, with the spectre
of higher interest rates pulling share prices off their September highs.
The parallels he draws are eerie. The economy is strong; the dollar weak.
After a springtime plunge, the Treasury market slumped anew last month. With
bond yields climbing, dividend yields are still well below their historical
levels. Meanwhile, mergers and acquisitions are propping up share prices in
a range of sectors.
These forces are as evident this autumn as they were leading up to October
19, 1987, that fateful Monday when panic selling scythed 508 points, or 22.6
per cent, off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Mr Shulman observes that seven years ago 'there was insufficient capital
simultaneously to fund a global bull market and an economic expansion. The
tension was resolved by a capitulation in the financial markets.'
Any capitulation this year is likely to be much less devastating, the New
York analyst concedes. 'A somewhat less-extended market should help temper
the potential downside risk.' Still, he predicts that the bellwether blue
chip index will revisit the 3,500 level before it again sees the likes of
its September 15 close at 3,953.
Not every analyst on Wall Street shares this view. Ms Gail Dudack at SG
Warburg is standing by her rosy prediction that the Dow will hit 4,200 by
the year-end. But even Ms Dudack, whose optimism runs deeper than most of
her colleagues, admits to feeling cautious as the fourth quarter gets under
way.
Interest rates are the key, most observers agree. 'Should the erosion of
bond prices continue, yields (on the benchmark 30-year government issue)
will soon approach the 8 per cent level, a big hurdle for equities since
asset allocation models will begin to favour bonds over stocks,' Ms Dudack
writes in a recent Warburg briefing.
In essence, the appeal of equity investments has waned in comparison with
the competition since January 31, when the Dow peaked at 3,978. The reason
is the steady rise in rates.
Individual investors, who have put the zip into the market since early 1991,
began to react to this gradual shift last month, taking refuge again in the
relative safety of money-market funds. They were turning tail just as the
first tangible evidence of a cyclical upturn in inflation surfaced in the
economy.
Two weeks ago, it was revealed that prices at the producer level had jumped
by 0.6 per cent in August, the biggest jump since 1990. Meanwhile, American
factories and mines were working closer to full capacity than any time in
past five years. As surplus materials and labour grow scarer, economists
fear prices for both could escalate quickly.
Fidelity Investments, the country's largest mutual fund group, said its
stock sales were halved last month, while its money-market business was
three times greater than in August.
Why did the little guy start to shy away from equities? 'The year-long rise
in interest rates, both long and short-term, has changed the valuation
backdrop substantially,' explains Mr William Dodge, chief strategist at Dean
Witter Reynolds.
The spread between bond yields - which determine the return on money market
funds - and the expected return on stocks has simply grown too wide, he
argues. Bond yields have surged over the past nine months, while stock
values have stalled, at best. The average retiree can no longer bank on a
steady rise in share prices to offset dividend yields which remain
stubbornly below 3 per cent.
In all likelihood, the gulf will get worse before it gets better, making
stocks even less attractive. Bond yields are driven by monetary policy, and
by all accounts the Federal Reserve is poised to tighten credit conditions
as soon as its chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan, sees a few more signs that the
economy is growing at an unmanageable pace.
That was the message which Wall Street gleaned last Tuesday from the
elliptical statement which was issued after the Fed's policy-making arm
adjourned its regular meeting without sanctioning an immediate rate hike.
Most analysts had expected the central bank to hold its fire, perhaps until
after the November congressional elections. Still, in the fortnight before
the meeting, the Dow industrial index back pedalled about 100 points on the
growing sense that rates would have to go a lot higher more before they
could come down again. 'The only way out is for the economy to slow,' says
Mr Dodge.
October is traditionally a volatile month on Wall Street, as investors react
to the torrent of third-quarter results released by US companies. This year,
the ride is likely to be even bumpier than usual.

FT  01 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign sales push Hong
Kong down 1.9%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
With most of the profit-taking for the interim book closing out of the way,
corporate and banking investors remained inactive and the Nikkei index
closed marginally lower after fluctuating within a narrow range, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed down 51.31 at 19,563.81 after a high of 19,719.04 and a low
of 19,519.70. Small lot buying by public pension and postal funds supported
share prices in the morning, but arbitrage unwinding and selling by dealers
eroded the gains.
Volume totaled 223m shares against 263m. The Topix index of all first
section stocks gained 0.62 to 1,576.89 while the Nikkei 300 fell 0.30 to
288.39. Advances led declines by 518 to 437 with 224 unchanged and, in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.89 to 1,287.32.
Traders said that dealers and most investors were cautious of carrying
positions over the weekend due to the uncertainty over the course of the
US-Japan framework talks on trade.
Car companies were stronger on hopes of strong car sale figures, due to be
released on Monday. Suzuki Motor rose Y30 to Y1,200 and Nissan Motor gained
Y15 to Y809.
Steel stocks were traded actively. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of
the day, fell Y2 to Y390 and NKK remained unchanged at Y292.
Speculative stocks fell on profit taking. Tsumura, a drug maker, lost Y50 to
Y1,190 and Sumitomo Coal Mining declined Y21 to Y705.
Tokyo Style, a leading apparel maker, retreated Y150 to Y1,770 on reports
that its interim operating profits fell by 13 per cent.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 6.30 to 21,985.13 in volume of 29.5m shares.
Roundup
HONG KONG fell 1.9 per cent, responding to the depressed tone of some
overseas markets and and weakness in local property company shares. The Hang
Seng index lost 178.97 to 9,521.24, after briefly dipping below 9,500, in
turnover that rose to HKDollars 4.14bn from Thursday's HKDollars 3.67bn. The
index was 1.2 per cent lower on the week.
Analysts said that European funds were sellers at the start of their
business day following Wall Street's slide overnight, and a low sale price
of some local flats also hurt sentiment.
Cheung Kong tumbled HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars 37.60, Sun Hung Kai dropped
HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 57.50 and Henderson Land lost 80 cents to
HKDollars 48.
TAIPEI edged back as the market consolidated after setting a four year high
on Thursday. The weighted index was 10.00 lower at 7,191.13, for a 3.8 per
cent rise on the week.
Financials that led the week's saw the heaviest selling. Hwa Nan, Chang Hwa
and First Commercial banks each lost TDollars 5 to TDollars 227, TDollars
208 and TDollars 208 respectively.
Steels, however, posted gains on reports that a steel factory in South Korea
had been shut because of fire. China Steel climbed 40 cents to TDollars 27.8
and Kao Hsing Chang was up 80 cents to TDollars 25.
BANGKOK edged higher, led by energy shares, and the SET index closed picked
up 3.59 at 1,485.71 for a 1.4 per cent fall over the week.
KUALA LUMPUR saw late bargain hunting that helped share prices to recoup
most of their early losses and the composite index closed down 3.92 at
1,129.76, for an 3.5 per cent loss over the week.
SINGAPORE was broadly easier on a day marked by profit-taking and
book-squaring ahead of the end of the corporate quarter. The Straits Times
Industrials index ended 16.27 lower at 2,332.63, for a 1.3 per cent rise on
the week.
MANILA posted further gains on the continuing recovery of PLDT, bargain
hunting among blue chips and the peso's fall against the dollar. The
composite index closed 16.28 up to 2,908.24, for a 1.7 per cent fall on the
week. PLDT rose 50 pesos or 3.4 per cent to 1,510 pesos.
SEOUL picked up in active trade after two days of consolidation as
petrochemical shares led a broadly based rally, and the composite index
closed 12.95 higher at 1,050.50, for a 1.9 per cent rise on the week.
BOMBAY was lower on sustained selling pressure and the BSE 30 share index
lost 53.82 to 4,304.48 for a 175 per cent fall on the week.

FT  01 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gestetner shock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gestetner reacted dramatically to the news of a Pounds 6.1m loss in the
futures market, diving 23 to 123p as analysts took a gloomy view of the
immediate profits outlook.
The feeling was that Gestetner is wiping the slate clean in one go but at a
big cost to earnings. Plainly the futures loss will cut a substantial swathe
through Gestetner's cash-flow if profit estimates of Pounds 21m pre-tax for
this year are anywhere near the mark.
Shares in Manchester United jumped 9 to 695p as the market appreciated the
sharp rise in full year figures from last season's UK premier league
champions.
News of a four-for-one bonus issue was also well received by investors.
HSBC were under pressure throughout the session, with one of the market's
leading agency brokers said to have been a persistent and sizeable seller of
the shares which closed a net 13 1/2 off at 682 1/2 p. NatWest put on 11 1/2
to 487 1/2 p after strong support from UBS.
Merchant banks dropped heavily with institutions fretting about the impact
of the recent turbulence in international markets on dealing profits. SG
Warburg lost 11 to 670p. Smith New Court, the integrated securities house
eased 3 more to 374p.
The two English generators came up with further good gains with the market
still adopting a positive position on the two stocks after Thursday's news
that the government intends selling its remaining 40 per cent stakes in
February. National Power jumped 10 to 460 1/2 p and PowerGen 12 to 526 1/2
p.
YJ Lovell, the building group, was among the market's worst performers, the
shares plunging 10, or over 13 per cent, to 65p.
Shares in sports wear and shoe company Hi-Tec Sports tumbled 33 to 45p,
after it said the six month period to January 1995 'will still be tough' and
trading in that period is 'unlikely to have a significant impact on
operating profits until 1995.'
The company reported a Pounds 7.11m interim loss against a profit of Pounds
780,000 a year earlier.
Hotels group Forte continued to celebrate Thursday's better than anticipated
interim figures and the shares advanced another 2 to 224p, after trade of
2.4m. However, NatWest Securities remains a bear of the stock and advised
investors to reduce holdings saying 'The corporate strategy may have started
to come together but the debt mountain has yet to be tackled. despite the
underperformance, on fundamentals the shares remain overvalued.'
Diversified industrial Tompkins moved up strongly in 5m shares traded,
rising 7 1/2 to 221 1/2 p. The persistent talk among analysts was that the
company was about to tee up some sort of takeover.
Both Reed International and Pearson moved up smartly among publishers but
trading volume was miserably thin. Reed gained 13 to 766p and Pearson put on
7 to 582p. United Newspapers dipped 7 to 498p, despite a buy recommendation
from Kleinwort Benson.
Elsewhere in the media sector, exhibitions group and one time stock market
high-flier Blenheim, rose strongly, climbing 11 to 246p followings news that
the board and big shareholder Generale des Eaux (now up to 15.1 per cent)
have been buying the company's shares.
The idea of an outright bidding war for VSEL lost momentum yesterday with
the stockmarket's two most fancied bid candidates, British Aerospace and GEC
taking no immediate action. VSEL eased 18 to 1210p on turnover of 1.3m.
Some traders doubted whether GEC - up 3 to 292p - would want to get involved
in a contested bid. BAe recovered part of yesterday's 15 fall, improving 3
1/2 to 452 1/2 p.
GKN shares were a feature of a buoyant Footsie, jumping 12 1/2 to 616 1/2 p
in 1.2m trades, helped by the generally bullish tone of a mid-week
presentation to Scottish analysts.
Transport shares shared in the general recovery. BAA rose 13 to 487p in low
turnover while British Airways rose 17 to 361p.

FT  01 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas in demand
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The see-saw performance by British Gas shares over recent sessions continued
yesterday with further dividend upgrades by some of the market's leading
broking houses driving the shares sharply better and recapturing most of the
fall that followed Thursday's important strategy meeting.
At the close Gas shares, again the heaviest individual traded stock in the
market, were 8 1/2 higher at 298 1/2 p on turnover of 15m.
Firmer oil prices, plus Talk of renewed US and domestic buying interest
helped BP move up 6 1/2 to 399 1/2 p on 11m traded. Shell, still helped by
the recent upgrade by Nomura, jumped 11 1/2 to 698 1/2 p.

FT  01 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Mixed trend in Recs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
South Wales Electricity was the biggest casualty in a mixed electricity
sector after the group said it had ended its share buy back programme ahead
of its 'closed period' which starts on October 7.
Companies and their directors are not allowed to trade in their own shares
for two months prior to reporting figures; Swalec is scheduled to announce
interims on October 7. Yesterday Swalec bought in 1.4m shares at 786p
bringing its total purchases up to its intended level, 7 per cent, ahead of
the closed period. Swalec has shareholder authority to buy up to 10 per cent
of its own stock.
At the close of trading Swalec shares were 26 lower at 763p, their lowest
level since mid-August. Swalec embarked on its buy-back programme on
September 6.
Southern Electricity, on the other hand, was the best performer in the
sector, the shares climbing 11 to 724p after a buy recommendation from
NatWest Securities. NatWest's utilities team described Southern as 'way
ahead of the pack' on its cost cutting ability. NatWest said that it
believed Southern to be committed to share-buy backs and to full demerger of
the National Grid, with Grid demerger enhancing the prospective dividend by
2.5 per cent and buy-backs by almost 10 per cent.

FT  01 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buying programme lifts shares at the
close - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK stock market rounded off the third trading quarter of the year with a
sudden burst of optimism as a Pounds 100m buy programme, reportedly from
UBS, the Swiss investment bank, helped spur the FT-SE 100 Share Index
comfortably above the 3,000 mark.
The final reading put the Footsie at 3,026.3, the best of the day and a net
gain of 33.8 on the session. The December stock index futures contract
closed strongly just above 3,040. Almost all the advance in the equity
sector came towards the close of trading when markets also responded to
reports, later denied, of a favourable settlement to the US-Japan trade
negotiations.
For much of the session, the market moved uncertainly, regaining and then
losing the Footsie 3,000 benchmark in very modest trading volume. The big
securities houses were still digesting the Pounds 250m trading programme of
the previous day, which had proved the final straw for trading books already
hit several times this week by sizeable sell programmes. Some dealing houses
are believed to have suffered severe losses as share prices have moved
sharply and often erratically. However, retail business in equities has
remained at a profitable level for the London securities industry.
Market confidence was not helped when SG Warburg, the London based
investment bank, trimmed its year-end forecast for the Footsie Index from
its long-standing target of 3,500 to 3,250 because of the continued weakness
in UK gilts.
Boosted perceptibly by yesterday's late upswing, the stock market ended the
third quarter with a gain of around 3.7 per cent, or 107 points on the FT-SE
100 Index over the three months. This week has brought further pressure on
UK equities, with some institutions moving into bonds and some preferring to
face their quarterly meeting with trustees with increased weightings in cash
rather than equities.
The stock market had settled won with a very modest gain at mid-afternoon
yesterday when equity traders had effectively balanced their books for the
end of the quarter. Consequently, the Swiss bank's buying programme,
accompanied by a sharp jump in the Dow Average on the US-Japan trade talk
rumours, sent the market ahead sharply. The gain in the Dow was also trimmed
to 10 points in UK trading hours.
Trading volume was slow to develop and the Seaq total stood barely above
3,000 shares in early afternoon. By the time the market closed, the trading
programme had lifted the Seaq total to 551.1m shares, still lagging behind
the 586.8m of the previous session. Blue chip stocks attracted most of the
interest yesterday, non-Footsie business making up only about 54 per cent of
the total. On Thursday, retail, or customer activity remained fairly high,
with a value total of Pounds 1.44bn.
The broader range of the market, less closely linked to stock index futures,
played little part in the late rally in the market. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index
continued to fall, closing a further 9.2 off at 3,494.8.
Long-dated British government bonds closed firmly, encouraged by
improvements in German and US bonds. Though sluggish for most of the day,
the long dates ended with gains of nearly half a point.
The short gilts, still nervous over the near term prospects for domestic
base rates, had a quiet day and ,lacking supporters, ended a shade off on
the session.
The UK markets are expected to open the final quarter of the year on a
cautious note, with investors focusing on important economic data due next
week in the UK and from Washington. The most serious test of the Federal
Reserve's policies and the market's nerves is expected on Friday when the
latest US payroll and unemployment figures are due.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar trades up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar rallied in afternoon trading yesterday on a Tokyo news service
report that a US-Japan trade deal had been agreed, writes Philip Coggan.
The dollar, which had been trading at around Y98.50 for much of the day,
jumped suddenly above Y99 on stories that the Japanese had agreed to relax
constraints on bidding for government projects.
The dollar then fell back below Y99, after Reuters reported a senior US
official as saying there was no procurement deal. The official predicted
that the result of the talks would be a partial deal, combined with light US
sanctions. The US had set yesterday as a deadline for the talks.
Nevertheless, the rumours aroused the currency markets from the lethargy
into which they sunk for much of the morning session. 'The markets have been
like a startled rabbit in the headlights of a car,' as they await the
outcome of the talks, according to Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at
Chemical Bank.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said that if the
dollar does break through the Y99 level, it could test Y100. But even if the
US currency rebounded as far as Y102/Y103, that would not break it out of
its long term trading range.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, thought the deal
would do little to help the dollar in the medium term. 'You need a recovery
in Japanese spending and import volumes to make significant inroads into the
trade surplus,' he said. 'Without a shrinking in the trade surplus, the
fundamental underpinning of the yen will remain.'
By the London close, the dollar was trading at Y98.9700, compared with
Y98.5050 on Thursday.
Economic news in the US and Germany seemed to have little effect on the
markets. Figures for German industrial production showed a
sharper-than-expected monthly fall of 3 per cent in August. 'There's been
quite a lot of bad news for the D-Mark this week but it hasn't been
affected,' said Mr Cocker.
US data was mixed with a strong rise in personal spending in August, but a
fall in the price component of the Chicago purchasing managers index. The
trade rumours, however, helped the dollar against the D-Mark. Itc closed in
London at DM1.5515, up from DM1.5461 on Thursday.
The UK purchasing managers' index showed signs of a slowing in the future
pace of growth and rate of price increases. But sterling remained on the
sidelines, ending the day down against the stronger dollar (at Dollars 1.577
from Thursday's Dollars 1.5810) and up slightly against the D-Mark (at
DM2.4468 from Thursday's DM2.4443).
Portugal said it would cut its discount rate from 12 per cent to 10.5 per
cent on Monday, but analysts said this was a technical rate which would have
little effect on the escudo. The Portuguese currency closed unchanged at
Es102/DM.
In the UK money markets, the Bank of England offered Pounds 499m of
assistance at established rates after forecasting a Pounds 800m shortage,
revised from an earlier estimate of Pounds 700m. Overnight rates moved
within the range of 6 per cent to 4 5/8 per cent.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper's advance boils
over
</HEADLINE>

London Metal Exchange traders watched anxiously yesterday morning as the
three months delivery copper price dipped below the Dollars 2,500-a-tonne
mark.
The price reached a 3 3/4 -year high of Dollars 2,578 on Wednesday but the
mood of the market changed the following day with the expiry of the
September position at the New York Commodity Exchange. Tightness in that
contract had been underpinning LME copper prices, dealers explained.
Stop-loss selling orders were triggered on Thursday as the three months
price fell through support at Dollars 2,550 and a short-term trend line at
Dollars 2,540. Further important chart levels were breached yesterday
morning, traders told the Reuters news agency, with continued stop-loss
selling accelerating the decline.
'The worrying thing about copper is that the market can go down to Dollars
2,150-2,200 and still be above the major uptrend line,' one dealer said.
Moreover, the copper market's upside potential is limited as its recent
support around Dollars 2,520 should now offer resistance.
Yesterday's early fall was halted at Dollars 2,495 a tonne by the appearance
of scale-down buying and some bargain-hunting. But by the close of the
afternoon ring late selling had taken the three months contract to Dollars
2,490.50 a tonne, down Dollars 40.25 on the day and Dollars 80 on the week.
The announcement first thing yesterday of a 1.16 per cent fall in LME
warehouse stocks of copper did little to relieve the market's gloom; but a
0.66 per cent fall in aluminium stocks was enough to underpin a rally in
that metal's prices. After an early dip to Dollars 1,601 a tonne the three
months position rose to Dollars 1,624 before closing at Dollars 1,617 a
tonne, down Dollars 2 on the day and Dollars 14 on the week.
Dealers said that the recovery was fuelled by speculative buying and
short-covering and suggested that the strength of chart-inspired support
around Dollars 1,600 boded well for an early attempt on the contract's
overhead objective of Dollars 1,650 a tonne.
The gold market ended lower on the week after briefly rising to Dollars 400
a troy ounce in response to a report, later denied, that Russia planned to
halt exports of the metal.
At the London bullion market the price ended Dollars 2.20 down overall at
Dollars 393.80 an ounce, but traders said it had done enough to foster hopes
of a renewed advance next week.
'Gold's uptrend remains intact down as far as Dollars 388-Dollars 389,' one
dealer pointed out, though he added that a retracement to that level would
long delay a fresh assault on Dollars 400.
The outlook for coffee prices appears less promising. In spite of the
continuing dryness in Brazilian growing regions the November futures price
at the London Commodity Exchange fell by Dollars 187 this week to Dollars
3,880 a tonne.
'It's looking fairly weak. Nobody is in the mood to buy, the roasters have
backed off and we're just drifting,' said one trader as the price extended
its decline yesterday. But others noted that concern about the Brazilian
weather situation was ensuring that selling pressure remained fairly light,
enabling the price to finish Dollars 40 above the day's low.
Reuters reported that the latest forecast indicated continued dry, warm
weather over the weekend in most Brazilian coffee growing areas, though a
few scattered storms were possible.
