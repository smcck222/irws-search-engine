A Note to the User

The material on this disk is copyrighted and is subject to the terms and 
conditions of the TREC-96 Information-Retrieval Text Research Collection User 
Agreement, which must be signed in order to obtain a copy of the CD-ROM on 
which this data is to be found.

The changes between the original material as it came from the publisher and the 
version on this disk is detailed in the following file: readfrcg.

The only tag changes were as follows:

PUBLICATION tag was replaced by <PUB>.  The END tag was deleted. 

The format uses a labelled bracketing, expressed in the style of SGML 
(Standard Generalized Markup Language).  The SGML DTD's used for verification 
at NIST are included on the CDs.  All of the different datasets have their 
major structures identical for easier reading, but have different minor 
structures.  The philosophy in the formatting at NIST has been to preserve as 
much of the original structure as possible, but to provide enough consistency 
to allow simple decoding of the data.

The major data structures are illustrated below in a sample of the Financial 
Times data.

Correction (published 16th May 1991) appended to this article.
'FRANK, it flies]' shouted someone at Sir Frank Whittle during the maiden
flight of a British jet. 'Of course it does,' replied Sir Frank, who
patented the first aircraft gas turbine. 'That's what it was bloody well
designed to do, wasn't it?'
Exactly 50 years ago yesterday, the first British jet made a brief 17-minute
flight from RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. To celebrate the event, Mr Eric
'Winkle' Brown, a 72-year-old test pilot of the prototype Gloster Whittle
jet, Mr Geoffrey Bone, a 73-year-old engineer, and Mr Charles McClure, a
75-year-old pilot, returned to RAF Cranwell. They are seen in front of a
restored Meteor NF 11. Sir Frank was unable to attend because of ill-health.
The Gloster Whittle was not the first jet to fly: a Heinkel 178 had its
maiden flight in August 1939, 21 months before the British aircraft.

Every document is bracketed by <DOC> </DOC> tags and has a unique document 
number, bracketed by <DOCNO> </DOCNO> tags.  Each beginning tag starts as the 
first character of a new line, but the ending tags could be on the same line or
on later lines.

The datasets have all been compressed using the UNIX compress utility and are 
stored in chunks of about 1 megabyte each (uncompressed size).

Both as part of the philosophy of leaving the data as close to the original as 
possible, and because it is impossible to check all the data manually, there 
are many "errors" in the data.  These range from errors in the original data, 
such as typographical errors, improper tagging errors, to errors in the 
reformatting done at NIST.  The error-checking has concentrated on allowing 
readability of the data rather than on correcting content.  This means that 
there have been automated checks for control characters, special symbols,
foreign language characters, correct matching of the begin and end tags, and 
complete DOC and DOCNO fields.  The types of "errors" remaining include 
fragment sentences, strange formatting around tables or other "non-textual" 
items, misspellings, missing fields (that are generally missing from the 
data), etc.

Special thanks should go to Mike Gardner and Nigel Foulks at the Financial
Times for providing this data.  Also special thanks to Professor Keith van
Rijsbergen and Mark Sanderson at the University of Glasgow for arranging for 
TREC to use this data.
