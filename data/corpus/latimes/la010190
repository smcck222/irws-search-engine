COUNTY'S PLAN IS GARBAGE; 
</P>
<P>
TRASH DISPOSAL: IF SOMETHING ISN'T DONE QUICKLY, LOS ANGELES CITY RESIDENTS 
WILL END UP MAKING UNJUSTIFIED CONCESSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO COSBY-ROSSMANN, Antonio Cosby-Rossmann, an attorney and lecturer at 
Stanford Law School, has represented citizens of the City of Los Angeles in the 
garbage wars since 1973. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County of Los Angeles, which has historically embraced some of the nation's 
sharpest land swindles, is out to break new ground in its legacy of shady 
real-estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
Purportedly acting to provide a badly needed garbage facility, the Board of 
Supervisors has secretly approved a plan that will enrich the county 
bureaucracy and a high-powered developer at the expense of Los Angeles city 
taxpayers and Santa Monica Mountains park users. Because the City Council 
tentatively approved the plan with little public notice or review, aggressive 
citizen action is needed to keep it from becoming reality. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors' plan begins with a worthy enough goal: to construct a readily 
accessible, environmentally sound garbage-disposal facility that can meet 
countywide needs for half a century. The location, Elsmere Canyon, lies in the 
San Gabriel Mountains just north of the city-county line and along the Antelope 
Valley Freeway. Virtually all the experts agree that Elsmere is the appropriate 
place for the county's major disposal facility. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than seize with principle this opportunity to meet public needs, the 
supervisors' program threatens establishment of the dump by attaching illegal 
and unwise conditions to Elsmere's use by all county residents. Like an 
entrepreneur in control of a hot property, the county sees Elsmere as an 
opportunity to maximize profits, broaden its options for future trash disposal 
and realize revenge against an old adversary, the city. Taking advantage of its 
public power to condemn the Elsmere land, the county seeks to extort 
unjustified concessions from city residents. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, the supervisors demand as a condition of dumping Los Angeles 
city garbage in Elsmere Canyon: 
</P>
<P>
 -- That dumping in Lopez Canyon be expanded and continued until 1996, even 
though the site violates state standards; 
</P>
<P>
 -- That dumping in Sunshine Canyon also be expanded, even though the operation 
violates a 25-year-old city permit; 
</P>
<P>
 -- That the city pay an extra "tribute" of at least $1 dollar a ton for 
dumping at Elsmere that can be increased at the sole discretion of the county 
and its Sanitation District; 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains be sold at 
market value, rather than released to park agencies at acquisition costs, as 
state law requires. (The sites are no longer suitable for dumping but held in 
trust by the county Sanitation District for public recreation.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- That Mission Canyon, county-owned under the same trusteeship as Rustic and 
Sullivan canyons, not be released for recreational use but be sold to developer 
Ray Watt, providing necessary access to his ambitious and adjacent development. 
</P>
<P>
Extortion of the city is the only glue holding together the Elsmere plan. 
County supervisors have been angry ever since the city closed the county's 
Mission Canyon garbage site in 1981. The city used its land-use authority to 
end dumping at the facility, located within city limits, citing harm done to 
surrounding neighbors. In response, the county has prohibited the city from 
dumping garbage at county sites open to other municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
This policy of blackmail, designed to force the city to place new garbage dumps 
within its borders, regardless of the environmental consequences, did not work 
so long as existing city facilities had not reached capacity. But with Lopez 
and Sunshine canyons nearing their limits, the extortion becomes more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
Alternative solutions exist that would create a garbage facility for all county 
residents, expand recreational opportunities in the Santa Monica Mountains and 
end existing conflicts over garbage dumping next to established neighborhoods: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Elsmere facility, designed to prevent harm to existing neighbors, 
should be established as soon as possible; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elsmere should be open at uniform fees to all residents; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
 -- Garbage dumping in Lopez and Sunshine canyons should terminate when current 
permits expire; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rustic, Sullivan and Mission canyons should be transferred to the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy for recreation at acquisition cost; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elsmere's uniform disposal fees should be used to reimburse the county and 
its Sanitation District for the transfer of the canyons, because all county 
residents will benefit from this new parkland; 
</P>
<P>
 -- The state attorney general should immediately prosecute county officials 
who maintain the policy of extortion. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the county's secretly formulated plan has been exposed, citizens and 
their representatives at City Hall can force a publicly acceptable substitute. 
As shown by its vote last month to require separation of household trash, the 
City Council can make sound policy. Los Angeles citizens and their council must 
undo the county's attempted swindle of public resources.

ROMANIAN REBUILDING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The deaths of thousands of people in Timisoara and Bucharest were not in vain. 
The extent of the tyranny that ruled Romania is beyond belief. 
</P>
<P>
For such a monstrosity to be overcome so fast is in itself a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
The battle is hardly over; although the cancerous core of the leadership is 
gone, the weight of the past must be now reshaped into a future. This could be 
the first time in recent history that America and the Soviet Union cooperate in 
the rebuilding of a shattered state and economy. 
</P>
<P>
Romania needs all the help we can offer: Advisers from a mutual pool of 
human/technological resources provided through the United Nations and other 
international bodies. An unprecedented opportunity is now presenting itself; a 
global shift towards increased cooperation between the East and West on many 
levels previously thought impossible. 
</P>
<P>
The bloody failure of the police state run by Ceausescu could have become a 
drawn-out civil war. Instead, it seems to be headed in a positive direction. 
</P>
<P>
We can help Romania and Eastern Europe rebuild their economies, and work 
together towards a positive future. There are astounding implications for world 
peace and commerce, two faces of the same dream.

LEGALIZING ILLICIT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three cheers for Rep. George W. Crockett (D-Mich.), columnist William F. 
Buckley, former Secretary of State George Schultz, U.S. District Judge Robert 
Sweet and Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. While countless other public officials 
exploit the drug problem for personal political advantage, they have 
unselfishly championed the only rational, effective alternative to the 
currently disastrous situation: legalization. 
</P>
<P>
Supply does not create demand. Demand creates supply. We can spend any amount 
of money trying to intercept substances. We can impose any penalty on the 
dealers and users. We can completely erode the civil rights of our citizens. 
But as long as someone is willing to pay for a commodity, someone will be 
willing to supply that commodity; and the more risk the suppliers assume, the 
greater their profits will be. This is basic economics, simple human nature and 
can not be altered by legislation. 
</P>
<P>
What we can do is eliminate international drug lords, terrorism, corruption and 
criminal empires by taking the profit out of the equation. By shattering their 
market, we can literally shut down these drug mafias overnight. 
</P>
<P>
We can also redirect our efforts and resources toward diminishing the demand 
for drugs by accurately publicizing the health risks inherent to the user. 
Former Surgeon General Koop has demonstrated that the public can be positively 
influenced in terms of substance abuse. And he didn't require a $9 billion 
budget to do it. 
</P>
<P>
By initiating serious discussion of the decriminalization issue, Messrs. 
Crockett, Buckley, Schultz, Sweet and Schmoke have done far more to protect our 
youth from the drug problem than all the rest of the "drug warriors" combined.

Surprise. Domestic auto sales are in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
I submit a partial list of possible reasons why: 
</P>
<P>
My 1985 Dodge Shelby Charger has had the brakes fail, the alternator fail, the 
timing belt fail, the computer fail, the headlights fail, the fuel system fail, 
the radio fail, the tachometer fail, the cooling system fail, the 
air-conditioning system fail, the battery fail (twice), the hatch lifters fail 
and the paint fail. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the turbo, lurking under the hood for the warranty to expire amid 
a flurry of repair dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Is there any question why the American public is giving pause before purchasing 
a domestic automobile that is (1) overpriced to start with, (2) unreliable and 
will need inevitable/expensive repair of even basic systems and (3) will lose 
resale value faster than back issues of Proctology Digest?

LEGALIZING ILLICIT DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Kunstler (Op-Ed, Dec. 15, "Why Not Sell at the Local Pharmacy?") 
continues the cry for drug legalization. Typically he raises the specter of 
violence, illicit profits, etc. and reaches the perfectly logical conclusion 
that prohibition doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, no thinking person would disagree with him. He fails, however, to 
point out that legalization (of alcohol, caffeine and nicotine) is hardly a 
howling success. 
</P>
<P>
Since our society has been so unsuccessful in "educating and treating" the 
current crop of boozers, smokers and coffee drinkers, what in the world makes 
Kunstler and all the rest think that, once legalized, the control of the much 
more addictive and psychoactive substances such as cocaine, marijuana and 
heroin will be so simple?

POP GOES THE REFUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pennies will be closer to nickels today for thrifty consumers who recycle their 
empty soda and beer containers. A new state law will boost the ineffective 
one-cent refund to a nickel for two small cans or one large bottle. 
</P>
<P>
The higher refunds will make recycling a little more rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
Californians have bothered to return barely half of their empties to recycling 
depots at nearby supermarkets or to a state-certified recycling centers since 
the bottle law took effect just over two years ago. Even environmentally minded 
consumers have argued that a penny back wasn't worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The stronger incentive takes effect today. An empty two-liter bottle, glass or 
plastic, is worth five cents. Also, worth a nickel are two cans or bottles that 
contain less than 24 ounces. Five cents, the standard reward in states that 
have successful bottle laws, ought to prove persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
Californians drink 12 billion bottles and cans of soda or beer in a typical 
year. The empties choke landfills -- and that's when the cans and bottles are 
properly disposed. Many are just tossed away by litterbugs, blighting beaches, 
parks and roads. Maybe a nickel will change their bad habits. 
</P>
<P>
Recycling can take some pressure off the distressed environment. Consumers who 
take the time to return their empties deserve their reward.

TRIBUTE TO A WAR HERO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not too long ago many Americans believed marijuana was no more harmful than 
tobacco, and a presidential adviser described cocaine as "probably the most 
benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use . . ." Back then, police 
officers fought a dangerous, lonely and unappreciated war against drugs. Los 
Angeles Police Officer Kelly Key was one of its troopers. 
</P>
<P>
He was paralyzed nearly two decades ago by a bullet fired while he tried to 
serve a search warrant on a suspected cocaine dealer. Key died last week, 
having spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair from which he taught 
youngsters the dangers of drugs and other temptations of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
A quadriplegic, he still volunteered three days a week at the Gwen Bolden 
Foundation, an after-school counseling program in a rough neighborhood south of 
downtown Los Angeles. Key was a tutor and a mentor, often for boys with no 
other man in their lives. He bought book-packs, shoes and treated youngsters to 
lunch, which was for many their first experience in a restaurant. He quietly 
did things to teach youngsters to feel good about themselves. There was no 
better role model in the war against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Drug use has exploded exponentially since a bullet cut short Key's once-bright 
police career in 1970. Now it destroys lives, families and communities 
wholesale. As the terror of the nightmare grows, more officers like Key risk 
their lives. But, as law enforcement leaders are beginning to recognize, the 
war must be waged with equal fervor against the underlying social causes that 
make illicit drugs so alluring for so many. Prevention must be as important as 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Key, who turned 49 the day before he died, will be buried Tuesday with 
full Police Department honors. His tombstone should read: Pioneer and Hero in 
the War Against Drugs.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: TEACH YOUNGSTERS TO PROFIT FROM SETBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: How can I help build my children's self-esteem and make them 
able to succeed in a tough world? I don't want them to be insensitive, but I 
don't want them to wilt every time something difficult comes along. My wife and 
I aren't wealthy, so they're going to have to make it on their own. -- T.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR T.S.: The fact that you're aware that youngsters need to be able to cope 
with frustration and disappointment is already a plus. Children need to learn 
how to cope with defeat and parents need to explain that we all learn from our 
failures. If a child doesn't know this, he may limit himself by trying only 
those tasks he knows he can do well. 
</P>
<P>
When things go wrong, when your youngster gets a disappointing grade or when he 
fails on a test, help him not to be overcome by these setbacks. Remind him that 
they are temporary and that he can learn from his past errors and do better 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Scheier, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon University, found that 
optimists handle stress better than pessimists. Optimists tend to respond to 
disappointments by formulating a plan of action and asking other people for 
help and advice while pessimists are likely to react to the same difficulties 
by trying to forget the whole thing or by assuming there's nothing they can do 
to change things. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I'm engaged to a wonderful woman but I'm troubled by what 
happens to her when she drinks. First of all, she doesn't seem to know when to 
stop, and when I mention this the next day, she gets defensive, assuring me 
that she can stop whenever she wants. I know that after we've been celebrating 
at a party, she doesn't remember things that have happened the night before. 
This is important because she frequently behaves badly. How can I handle this 
and should I insist that she go on the wagon? -- F.T. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.T.: I doubt that you'd accomplish much if you simply "insisted" that she 
go on the wagon. She's showing symptoms of alcoholism, such as personality 
changes when she drinks, denial about her drinking patterns and blackouts or 
memory lapses. While some non-alcoholics do occasionally experience these same 
symptoms, it's unusual and is a strong indication that there are serious 
drinking problems. 
</P>
<P>
There are ways to spot future alcoholics, such as the need to find constant 
excuses for a drink, and the pattern of having every occasion -- sad or happy 
-- begin and end with a drink. Another clue that you seem to be getting is the 
inability of your friend to stop drinking or to refuse alcohol once she's 
started. 
</P>
<P>
Try to get her to some meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous. If she refuses, I'd 
postpone plans for marriage until she reconsiders.

GRIM TALES INHABIT SPECIAL DARK REALITY

<TEXT>
<P>
A Place of Light by Mary Bush (Morrow: $16.95; 258 pps.) 
</P>
<P>
"I had four sisters in my life, but Maude is the only one alive," a boy in his 
teens tells us in one of these stories. That's because his mother has the nasty 
habit of killing off her babies when they cry too much. All of the short 
stories in this sober, brilliant collection are set in rural, poverty-stricken, 
Upstate New York -- deserted backwaters where there are no jobs. The land is 
played out; the smart, enterprising people have left, and the collective gene 
pool is something you wouldn't want to dive into. 
</P>
<P>
What are "we" -- and, by that pronoun, I mean the educated, the orderly, even 
the "enlightened" readers scanning this review right now -- to make of stories 
like these? 
</P>
<P>
My feeling is that having lived through the so-called "holiday" season, many of 
us have had to notice once again that human emotions are often irrational and 
base; that maybe 50% of all parents wish devoutly that they'd never had their 
children; maybe 75% of all children -- even in these "enlightened" times -- 
grow up in terror of their parents, and, if they live long enough, are able to 
turn the tables on those creatures who have been so penurious with their 
affection and so prodigal with their insults and their dreadful threats, their 
pledges of undying hatred. The child has no recourse but to live long enough, 
stick around and make his or her abusive parents miserable and afraid! 
Something to live for, in these trying times. 
</P>
<P>
This collection deals with several levels of terror that (perhaps all) children 
have to deal with at one level or another. "Underground Railroad," with its 
baby-slaughtering mother, is only the most extreme example here. Some of these 
tales seem comparatively innocuous: "Muskrat" and "Rude Awakening" are both 
gender-oriented, coming-of-age stories: In the former, two small boys set out 
to trap muskrat and end up with something large and alive that isn't a muskrat, 
already suffering terribly from the cramped iron trap on its leg. Too fearful 
to let it loose, too fearful to admit their fear, the boys finally suffocate 
the animal by burying it alive in stones. 
</P>
<P>
Harmless, maybe, "Boys will be boys," and all that, but this stolid 
indifference to suffering comes back to haunt the reader in another story as 
two adult hunters carelessly terrorize a young couple in the woods. In "Rude 
Awakening" a young girl, cordially detested by her mother, is forced to put 
aside her overalls and don a white veil for her First Communion. She gets sick, 
and after long and horrible minutes, finally spits out the Host. Again, no harm 
is done, all little girls get sick, but her alienation from her family, her 
sense of being totally alone in the world, is confirmed forever. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these stories emerge from poverty, so that, if we own a microwave and 
an automatic coffee pot, or are saving our money in CDs, we may be able to 
persuade ourselves that they are not our stories. In "Difficult Passage," a 
little girl wheels her legless grandpa to the circus to see freaks, realizing 
in the process that the poverty-stricken people in her own town are not just 
the audience, but freaks as well. 
</P>
<P>
In two separate stories, incest (or plain child molestation), may be blamed on 
unemployment: If Uncle JoJo in "Outlaws" or the repellent Robert in "A Place of 
Light" had decent jobs, perhaps they wouldn't spend their waking hours trying 
to have sex with small girls. But I don't believe money fixes everything, and 
neither does the author. In two stories, unexpectedly, sanctuaries appear, out 
in grim woods, where, people manage to live in harmony with their surroundings 
and with self-respect. Just seeing these places, these people, heartens other 
characters, trapped in their own misery. Maybe it is possible to live another 
way, in a decent way. 
</P>
<P>
Always, with stories like this, there is that lame editorial attempt at 
distancing. In a downright pitiful blurb of this book, someone writes, ". . . 
Harsh lives make for compelling drama." Maybe. But I have a feeling the world 
is made up of those who know these stories are reality, and others, who peek 
into these pages, play dumb and say "Yum yum! Look at all these harsh lives and 
all this compelling drama!" 
</P>
<P>
Those who know this grim reality will take these stories straight to their sad 
hearts: "Not one other family looked like theirs," one lost little girl thinks. 
"No one was making a scene. No one else was miserable." But a lot of other 
people -- even with Dad hauling in the bucks and Mom wearing a giant gold 
necklace -- are starving, right now, for love. Or, dry as a bone, they know 
themselves unable to give that love. That's not "compelling drama." That's 
reality. Mary Bush reminds all of us that, paradoxically, in our terrible 
isolation, we're not alone.

THE ECCENTRIC BUDDHIST VISION OF ITO JAKUCHU, GREENGROCER AND ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An exhibition of Japanese paintings that caused a stir last fall in New York 
recently arrived at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "The Paintings of 
Jakuchu," which features an astonishing range of works by one of 18th-Century 
Japan's authentically great individualists, is certain to captivate aficionados 
as well as visitors who just wander into the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Jakuchu's colorfully painted scrolls depicting flora and fauna are so profusely 
detailed and brilliantly designed that they defy imagining how any mere human 
being could have created them. At the opposite extreme is his breathtakingly 
minimal series of six ink-on-paper scrolls called "Lotus Pond." The quiet scene 
melts away into a central space that appears to be empty but is actually filled 
with the specter of death and winter. 
</P>
<P>
Between these two poles of Jakuchu's sensibility are relatively crude paintings 
of clay dolls, striking woodblock prints of bright birds on velvety black 
backgrounds and -- seriously -- a funeral scene portraying the dead Buddha as a 
radish surrounded by mourning vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
There's a certain logic to "Vegetable Parinirvana," the improbable and 
apparently irreverent death scene. Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800) was the son of a 
greengrocer and ran the family's wholesale business for 17 years before he 
became a full-time artist at 40. He may have been more at home with the 
mushrooms, persimmons, yams and cucumbers in his parody than with human 
characters. An assiduous observer of nature, Jakuchu also raised chickens and 
elevated them to lofty heights of grace and beauty in his paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Environment may account for some of his subject matter, but there's no 
explaining the innovative talent and brilliant eccentricity that has 
distinguished Jakuchu in the annals of Japanese painting. A born artist, he was 
ill-suited to business and eventually unloaded that burden on a younger 
brother. Jakuchu had classical training in Japanese painting and drew 
inspiration from Chinese painters, but he developed such an unusual style that 
he stands out as an eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
One wonders how he got away with it, but in fact he was highly regarded during 
his life. Jakuchu had the good fortune to live in Kyoto during a peaceful time 
when a spirit of experimentation and individuality was in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
He initially gained fame for his masterpiece -- a series of 30 vividly painted 
scrolls known as the "Colorful Realm of Living Beings." Painted from about 1757 
to 1765, the scrolls are a pictorial encyclopedia of plants and animals 
interpreted according to Jakuchu's vision of peace and prosperity. He presented 
the scrolls in 1765 to Shokukuji, a Zen temple in Kyoto. They are part of the 
Imperial Household Collection and are rarely put on public exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Examples currently on display in Los Angeles are panels called "Mandarin Ducks 
in Snow," "Hydrangeas and Fowl," "Fish in a Lotus Pond," "Golden Pheasants in 
Snow" and "Birds and Peonies." All are poetic marriages of flora and fauna, so 
closely entwined that they seem to be of a piece. Striking in composition -- 
characterized by sweeping curves and rhythmic repetition -- the scrolls are 
skillfully detailed down to the last detail of the last feather. 
</P>
<P>
These color paintings represent one major component of Jakuchu's work. The 
other is ink paintings that reveal the artist's devotion to Zen. Strictly 
speaking, however, the ink paintings do not conform to Zen principles. Despite 
their enormous energy and directness, they are more calculated, less 
spontaneous in feeling than classical Zen works. 
</P>
<P>
Jakuchu was a lay Zen priest, so his affinity to the philosophy's artistic 
precepts are expected. But he was also such an individualist that he inevitably 
came up with his own style. It is typified by such ink paintings as "Two 
Roosters and a Hen" and "Pine, Plum and Crane," which contrast dramatic shapes 
and patterns with open space. 
</P>
<P>
About 45 works, on loan from Japanese collections, are on view on the lower 
floor of the Ahmanson Building, but they are only the beginning of a 
three-course Jakuchu banquet. Because of Japanese government regulations and 
the fragility of the works, "The Paintings of Jakuchu" is being presented in 
two parts. Part I continues through Jan. 14. Part II will be shown from Jan. 18 
to Feb. 18. Each portion contains a full chronological range of the artist's 
work, so that visitors who only see one part can grasp the whole of his oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
The third course of the banquet is an auxiliary exhibition (to Feb. 18) in the 
Japanese Pavilion. "The Colorful Realm of Jakuchu and Jakuen" consists of works 
by the master and his most prominent student, Jakuen, from American 
collections. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Denver Art Museum 
and four private collectors have loaned pieces that complement the County 
Museum of Art's extensive Jakuchu collection.

Talk Show Host Gets Death Threat: A radio talk show host in Greenville, S.C., 
said he has received a death threat invoking the name of a Denver radio 
personality whose murder was linked to white supremacists. Mike Gallagher, 
whose talk show on WFBC-AM airs from 9 a.m. until noon, said he had just 
finished a program on racism on Thursday when he received a telephone call from 
a man who identified himself only as "George from Anderson," a South Carolina 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher said the caller told him to "remember Alan Berg," the Denver talk 
show host who was gunned down in 1984. When Gallagher left the station around 2 
p.m., he found a note on his car windshield that included a racial remark, 
another reference to Berg and the words, "You're a dead man." The threat, which 
is being investigated by police, came after Gallagher and his callers discussed 
the controversy over a South Carolina sheriff accused of using a racial slur.

The Bride Wore Black: Jeff Clayton, 26-year-old lead singer with the punk rock 
band Anti-Seen, exchanged wedding vows Saturday with 20-year-old Dee Dazis in a 
Charlotte, N.C., nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
The bride wore black, as did almost all the guests. The best man was a woman 
and the flower girl was a grown man. Clayton and his bride promised "to love 
and obey, to have and to hold, to rock 'n' roll until death do us part." As 
soon as the vows were pronounced, Clayton left his bride at the bar and 
performed songs from Anti-Seen's latest album, "Noise for the Sake of Noise." 
Observed one guest: "Rock 'n' roll is, like, forever." SHAUNA SNOW

PAYCHECKS TO MEDICARE -- NEW FEDERAL LAWS TAKE EFFECT

<TEXT>
<P>
The new year ushers in an array of federal laws and regulations affecting 
everything from the size of Americans' paychecks to the operation of the Panama 
Canal. 
</P>
<P>
During the first week of 1990, Social Security taxes and benefits will go up, 
Medicare coverage will be cut back because of the repeal of catastrophic 
illness insurance and the canal will get a Panamanian administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Long-term programs will be started Jan. 1 to control Medicare payments to 
doctors, close military bases, prevent an accidental clash between U.S. and 
Soviet forces and set up new task forces to fight organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
The new laws and regulations include: 
</P>
<P>
Social Security -- Automatic 4.7% cost-of-living increases start for 39 million 
Social Security and Supplemental Security Income recipients. Average monthly 
benefits rise from $541 to $566 for Social Security and from $368 to $386 under 
SSI. 
</P>
<P>
The total Social Security tax rate rises from 7.51% to 7.65% and the maximum 
earnings subject to the tax will be go up from $48,000 to $51,300. The maximum 
tax bite will rise from $3,604.80 to $3,924.45. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of money Social Security recipients can earn without a reduction in 
benefits increases from $8,880 to $9,360 for those between ages 65 and 69 and 
from $6,480 to $6,840 for those under 65. 
</P>
<P>
Panama Canal -- Under the 1979 Panama Canal Act, the U.S. administrator, Dennis 
McAuliffe, steps down and turns over day-to-day control of the waterway to a 
Panamanian, who reports to the U.S.-dominated canal commission. 
</P>
<P>
Until the administrator nominated by the new government of Panama is approved 
by President Bush and the Senate, the deputy administrator, Fernando Manfredo, 
a Panamanian, will be acting administrator. Panama takes over the Canal on Dec. 
31, 1999. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare -- Because of the repeal of the Catastrophic Coverage Act, 32.6 
million senior citizens lose some hospitalization, skilled nursing and hospice 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
In one major change, seniors face paying a hospital deductible for each 90-day 
benefit period and daily $148 co-payments after the 60th day. Under the old 
law, the elderly received 365 days of hospitalization for one deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a computer glitch, the monthly supplemental catastrophic coverage 
premium will be deducted from Social Security checks and then refunded for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital deductible automatically increases from $560 to $592 to cover 
rising costs. The monthly Part B premium, covering doctor fees, rises from 
$27.90 to $28.60. But because seniors no longer owe a supplemental premium, 
Part B costs actually will be lower. 
</P>
<P>
The program to control the growth in Medicare payments to doctors and to shift 
spending from specialized procedures begins. In 1990, a 9.1% rise in costs has 
been targeted, contrasted with recent increases of 16%. 
</P>
<P>
National Security -- The military begins a program to close 86 bases by 1995. 
The cost-saving plan was drafted by a commission created by Congress and took 
effect when congressional opponents failed to muster enough votes to kill it in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
Communications between the United States and the Soviet Union will be improved 
to prevent accidental conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes -- Farm workers subject to Social Security withholding will be subject to 
income tax withholding. 
</P>
<P>
The excise tax paid by passengers on international flights from the United 
States increases from $3 to $6. 
</P>
<P>
A new excise tax of $3 will be charged each passenger on some ocean voyages. 
</P>
<P>
An excise tax of 5 cents a barrel will be levied on crude oil and imported 
petroleum products to create a trust fund to clean up oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
An excise tax on ozone-depleting chemicals will take effect. 
</P>
<P>
Tax preparers who fail to sign a return or fail to include a taxpayer 
identification number will face new penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Loan Programs -- The Veterans Affairs Department will guarantee up to $46,000 
of a home loan for a veteran or a survivor, up from $36,000. 
</P>
<P>
Schools whose students have fault rate of 30% or more will be excluded from the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous -- Organized crime task forces will be set up in each of the 23 
U.S. attorney's offices, replacing autonomous task forces.

BEHIND PASADENA'S ROSE-COLORED GLASSES, A CITY OF DIVERSITY; 
</P>
<P>
PARADE: COLORFUL FLOATS AND SPIRITED BANDS WILL TAKE A TOUR OF THE CITY'S HIGH 
AND LOW POINTS. 
</P>

<P>
There is a popular theory that views the Tournament of Roses as a prime reason 
-- the prime reason -- for the population explosion in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Every year on New Year's Day, millions of shivering Easterners and 
Midwesterners tune their television sets to the festivities in Pasadena. What 
they see is a compelling small-screen vision of balmy revelry, complete with 
suntanned princesses, football players in short sleeves, swirls of flowers and 
sun-dappled mountains. Then, migrating like lemmings, dazzled television 
viewers join the westward march. 
</P>
<P>
So goes the theory. 
</P>
<P>
For a century, Pasadenans have treasured that vision of their city as a place 
where dreams come true and the weather's fine any time of year. 
</P>
<P>
But behind the image of civilized hoopla is a complicated city of 132,000, 
struggling fitfully to reconcile its diverse elements. These days, the 
once-idyllic community -- which seems to stretch across the map of the western 
San Gabriel Valley like a child's bib -- has gangs, drugs, smog and a running 
debate on development. But it also can boast of visionary entrepreneurship, 
socially concerned city leaders, impressive arts and educational institutions 
and -- especially during the holiday season -- a spirit of optimism. 
</P>
<P>
"The Tournament focuses international attention on the city," said Pasadena 
Mayor William Thomson, "but it's also a time of celebration within the city. We 
tend to put aside our troubles and differences and focus on the good things in 
our lives." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Parade, which began 101 years ago as a horse-and-buggy romp through 
wrestern Pasadena, now cuts through the geographical and economic heart of the 
city. For discerning Pasadenans, the 5.5-mile parade route represents a brief 
tour of the city's high points and low points. 
</P>
<P>
It begins, fittingly, on Orange Grove Boulevard, where the city itself began in 
the late 19th Century. The parade starts out from the heart of well-to-do 
Pasadena, in a palmy section south of the Rose Bowl called "Millionaire's Row." 
</P>
<P>
By 8:10 a.m. today, when the Riverside Community College Marching Tigers Band 
leads the parade down the boulevard, the neighborhood will be crammed with 
floats and marchers. 
</P>
<P>
For well-heeled residents, this is something between a nuisance and a blessing. 
"You sort of can't live with it and you can't live without it," said Ken 
Grobecker, who grumbles good-naturedly about the parade goers who jam the west 
Pasadena neighborhood each year. 
</P>
<P>
The parade moves out slowly, passing the sprawling Norton Simon Museum of Art, 
then moving into Old Pasadena, the city's commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
Old Pasadena is where city planners like to tout their city's spirit of 
creativity. In less than 10 years, the area has gone from Skid Row to "Westwood 
East." Buildings that once moldered in disuse now house a Cajun restaurant, a 
fitness club, an espresso bar and a disco. More than 120 new businesses have 
opened there since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Brignole was one of the pioneers. He bought an 80-year-old DeLacey Avenue 
stable in 1985 and turned it into a prosperous health club. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is overjoyed about the crowds of young urban professionals surging 
from shop to shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It has a shiny new coat of paint, but, yeah, it's lost something," said Paul 
Elliott, a former Art Center College of Design student. 
</P>
<P>
"My favorite place was a bar called Hazel's," he said, "where the old-timers 
used to sit at the bar and drink straight shots of whiskey. . . . Now I see 
they've built a Benetton's where the Salvation Army used to be. That's the end 
of any neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
His is a minority view. Cassandra Einstein, a San Marino artist who sips cafe 
au lait at a Colorado Boulevard cafe, likes it just fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody who lives in Hollywood thinks this is the slow lane out here," said 
Einstein, a recent Los Angeles transplant. "But this is a charming little place 
to get yourself together in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
A mile or so to the north of the parade route, Carolyn Stonestreet sits on a 
bench at a Fair Oaks Avenue bus stop, talking about her troubled life in 
northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically homeless now," she said. "I'm staying with my sister and her 
boyfriend. I took my kids to their grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
Stonestreet's problems began when, after a long custody fight for her children 
-- now 5 and 9 -- she was dismissed by the pharmaceutical firm where she had 
worked for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"Welfare sent me to a shelter in downtown Los Angeles," she said, sobbing 
quietly. "I was terrified. I came back to Pasadena and told the social worker 
it was unbelievable. I'd rather sleep on the streets over here than go back 
over there." 
</P>
<P>
This is the neighborhood where the underclass of Pasadena lives. Predominantly 
black, northwest Pasadena had about 102 drive-by shootings in 1989. Six people 
were killed and 69 injured -- many of them innocent bystanders -- in shooting 
incidents, police say. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood also has many hard-working homeowners and apartment dwellers, 
sometimes overwhelmed by the crime around them. "The attitude by the 
authorities seems to be, as long as it's not blown out of proportion, let it 
go," one resident said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a population that's basically a labor population" but "there's not a 
single smokestack in Pasadena," said Ibrahim Naeem, director of the 
Pasadena-Foothill Branch of the Los Angeles Urban League. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a vast gap between haves and have-nots. A city commission on 
youth and families recently compared income levels in a census tract in 
northwest Pasadena with one in wealthy west Pasadena. They found a $68,170 
difference in median family income. 
</P>
<P>
Often, that gap translates into a black Pasadena and a white Pasadena, black 
leaders contend. "The city's attitude in the past can be called neglect at 
best," Naeem said. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of City Directors (Pasadena's city council) has tried recently to 
assuage the restive black community, which constitutes about 25% of the city. 
Last month, after months of criticism, the board authorized a $100,000 audit of 
city personnel practices to determine whether city policies have been racist or 
sexist over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
When the parade reaches the corner of Marengo Avenue, it is in developer 
territory, say slow-growth activists. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of the two-block Plaza Pasadena mall, between Marengo and Los 
Robles avenues, was one of the first signs that the city was on a 
no-holds-barred growth track, said Mike Salazar, co-chairman of Pasadenan 
Residents In Defense of our Environment (PRIDE). 
</P>
<P>
After 1977, when the Community Redevelopment Agency demolished such older 
structures as the Pasadena Athletic Club to make way for the mall, slow-growth 
resistance started to build. There were early battles, like a 1980 petition 
drive that ultimately stopped a plan for twin office towers in the middle of 
town. But boxy office towers continued to spring up, particularly along 
traffic-clogged Lake and Los Robles avenues. 
</P>
<P>
City planners say 156 office buildings have been built in the city since 1980, 
almost doubling office space to about 9.7 million square feet. At the same 
time, condominium projects popped up like toadstools. 
</P>
<P>
"People would go to the city and complain that it wasn't fair to their 
neighborhoods, which had been single-family homes for years," said Claire 
Bogaard, executive director of the preservation group Pasadena Heritage. "But 
generally the developers got their way." 
</P>
<P>
The scene was set for a battle at the polls. Last March, PRIDE won, as 57% of 
the voters approved a measure to restrict new housing and large commercial 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders worry that the measure will stifle the entrepreneurial spirit that 
brought Pasadena out of economic doldrums. "It's already causing a housing 
scarcity and driving up prices," Mayor Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
William Podley, president of the Pasadena-based real estate firm of Podley 
Caughey Associates, says prices are indeed skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
"Properties we handled last year for $190,000 or $195,000 are going for 
$240,000, maybe even $250,000." he said. 
</P>
<P>
The parade passes Hill Avenue, a main thoroughfare for Pasadena City College 
and, a few blocks to the south, Caltech. A mile north of the route, on 
Washington Boulevard, Mary Donikian doles out baklava for a customer at the 
American Armenian Grocery. 
</P>
<P>
It is a fragrant place, full of the dried fruits, nuts and cheeses that 
Armenians serve during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians used to celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6, commemorating the arrival of 
the three kings on the Day of Epiphany. "But we're getting used to American 
ways," said Donikian, who came to the United States from Lebanon 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Getting used to those ways has been tough going for many of Pasadena's 15,000 
Armenians. Refugees from discrimination in the Middle East and repression in 
the Soviet Union, most arrive with little knowledge of English and few job 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Pasadena has accepted them with extraordinary generosity, Armenian leaders 
say. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the Board of Directors gave Armenians a special protected status in 
awarding city contracts and recruiting for city jobs. Now, a polling firm is 
conducting the first-ever Armenian census to implement an affirmative action 
program. 
</P>
<P>
It has not been easy sledding, said Serge Samoniantz, whose firm is doing the 
census. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who have had experience with local government in the Soviet Union are 
extremely distrustful of anything that smacks of government," Samoniantz said. 
</P>
<P>
A hard right onto Sierra Madre Boulevard, and the parade comes to rest in 
Victory Park, where the colorful floats are then put on display. 
</P>
<P>
It's an appropriate resting place. Eastern Pasadena is the middle-income, 
home-owning bedrock of the city. The residents here are civil servants, 
contractors, small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks east of Victory Park is Upper Hastings Ranch, a hillside 
neighborhood of winding streets and slanted roofs. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday season is their neighborhood's time to shine. 
</P>
<P>
For the past 34 years, residents have lit up the night with a torrent of 
Christmas lights. So extravagant is the display that tour buses and long lines 
of cars edge through narrow streets. 
</P>
<P>
Committees impose unifying themes on each block -- Cartwright Street has the 12 
Days of Christmas -- and a panel of judges awards prizes for the best use of 
lights and the best humorous display. 
</P>
<P>
The Upper Hastings Ranch "light-up," as residents call it, is brilliant but, in 
the end, ephemeral. From her front lawn, Dottie Csik, whose evergreen bushes 
are seeded with tiny white lights, takes in the short-lived illumination. 
</P>
<P>
"After New Year's, it's like a morgue around here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Parade Starts at 8:10 A.M. 
</P>
<P>
The 101st Tournament of Roses Parade begins at 8:10 a.m. at Orange Grove and 
Del Mar boulevards, proceeds east along Colorado Boulevard to Sierra Madre 
Boulevard and ends at Paloma Street about two hours later. Post-parade viewing 
opens at 1:30 p.m. For more information, the parade hot line is (818) 584-5983.

MAN FATALLY STABBED IN PIZZA RESTAURANT;

CRIME: VICTIM CRASHES CHILD'S BIRTHDAY PARTY AND ARGUES WITH HIS ESTRANGED 
GIRLFRIEND, THE BOY'S MOTHER. SHE IS ARRESTED.

<P>
A man was fatally stabbed by his estranged girlfriend after he crashed a 
birthday party for her 3-year-old son Saturday night at a crowded family pizza 
restaurant in Granada Hills, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bridges, 28, a millwright from Apple Valley, was stabbed once or twice 
in the chest in a quarrel with Cynthia Stafford, 23, of Pacoima, Los Angeles 
police Detective Ken Buscarino said. 
</P>
<P>
Bridges died at about 8:30 a.m. Sunday at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Stafford, who was described as unemployed, was being held without bail on 
suspicion of murder, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had lived together about six months before breaking up and Bridges 
apparently went to the restaurant to try to revive the relationship, Buscarino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The detective said Stafford went to the Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theater 
with her son, about five other children and as many as 10 adult friends and 
relatives. Bridges showed up, uninvited, at about 7:30 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
"He was not the boy's father, but he had apparently befriended him when he was 
with the mother and somehow learned about the party," the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had a lengthy argument, Buscarino said. Stafford left the restaurant 
and walked to a nearby supermarket, where she bought a 10-inch steak knife and 
returned, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbing took place about 9 p.m. near a salad bar in a dining room, some 
distance away from the youngsters at the birthday party, who apparently did not 
witness it, Buscarino said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the detective added, officers interviewed about 10 eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure a lot of people saw it and grabbed their kids and left as fast as 
they could," Detective John Birrer said. "I'm surprised as many people hung 
around as they did by the time we got there." 
</P>
<P>
Buscarino said Bridges was aware that Stafford had a knife, but "he may have 
thought she was just threatening him. But he was wrong. She did him in. 
</P>
<P>
"It went down quickly," the detective said. "Bridges got stabbed and he didn't 
fall down or scream. He was able to stand upright until his friends in the 
party drove him to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Stafford's son was placed in the custody of his maternal grandmother, Buscarino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman, who identified herself as Stafford's mother, said she was at work 
several weeks ago when her daughter phoned to report that Bridges was at the 
Pacoima home Stafford and her son share with her. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just banging on the door. Pounding, pounding, pounding. I could hear it 
through the telephone," the woman said. "I told my supervisor I had to leave 
because somebody's trying to break into my house. When I got here, he was still 
pounding. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, he's a damn nut, and I guess she is too," the woman said of the victim 
and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was her baby's birthday party. This is what it started out as. And it 
turned into a tragedy."

Imagine a world in which short children are treated with a drug to make them 
taller. Although it borders on the Brave New World -- depicted in the 1930s 
novel by Aldous Huxley in which human embryos were tampered with so that they 
developed standard traits -- the technology necessary to turn this science 
fiction into fact is already being explored. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, physicians have been treating some midget children with growth 
hormone extracted from human cadavers to boost their height by the time they 
reach adulthood. (Unlike dwarfs, who have disproportionately large heads in 
relation to their limbs and torso, midgets are proportionately short). 
</P>
<P>
But only since 1985 has genetic engineering made it possible to generate the 
hormone in large enough quantities to be used for short children who are 
growing so slowly that they are not expected to reach more than 5 feet, 3 
inches if they are boys or 4 feet, 10 inches if girls. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., 
is currently conducting clinical tests to assess the effectiveness of growth 
hormone in these "normal" children, who, unlike midgets, do not have a classic 
growth hormone deficiency. The results will not be in for at least 10 years, 
but that has not stopped some doctors from using the therapy on such children. 
</P>
<P>
The use of growth hormone is presenting an ethical dilemma in a society that 
often measures the worth of people by their height. Others argue that no 
substance, regardless of one's ethical point of view, should be used widely 
until it is proven safe and effective. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent state-of-the-art conference on growth hormone therapy sponsored by 
the Swedish Medical Research Council in Stockholm, about the only point 15 
experts on the therapy could agree on was that tests used to detect a growth 
hormone deficiency are not reliable, said Louis Underwood, a University of 
North Carolina pediatric endocrinologist who attended the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Without dependable tests, physicians cannot separate children who are growing 
slowly because of a medical condition that is stemming their growth hormone 
production from children who are merely following a family tradition of being 
short. While it makes sense that physicians should correct the former, treating 
genetically short children with the hormone raises thorny ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
Short stature is not necessarily a disease, points out Leona Cuttler, a 
University of Chicago pediatric endocrinologist in an article in the Journal of 
the American Medical Assn. last year, but part of the normal variation in human 
appearance. Physicians who try to boost a normal short child's height with 
growth hormone may be likened to plastic surgeons who try to improve appearance 
with nose jobs and tummy tucks. 
</P>
<P>
But consenting adults submit to these cosmetic procedures, not children. 
Because growth hormone therapy is only thought to be effective in children and 
not full-grown adults, a child's parents and physician must decide if he should 
be treated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful when deciding whom to treat," says pediatric 
endocrinologist Gilbert August of George Washington University. "Often it isn't 
the kids who are worried about being short, but their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"These parents, who are short themselves, vicariously relive through the child 
their own failures in high school about not being able to make the team, etc. 
I've often joked that if you could just do a 'parentectomy' these kids would be 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
But even without parental pressures, short stature can be emotionally costly in 
our society, which values height. "The money you save by not giving growth 
hormone," says August, "you may as well give to a psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists cite studies showing success is tied to height, with taller 
people making more money or having more prestigious jobs on the average than 
shorter individuals. The midgets who portrayed the munchkins in the movie "The 
Wizard of Oz," for example, earned less money than the dog Toto. 
</P>
<P>
Short height, however, is a relative term that is dependent on the range of 
height in a population. When August told a group of dwarfs, for example, about 
the possibility of using growth hormone to boost a normal but short boy's final 
adult height from 5 feet, 1 inch to 5 feet, 3 inches, they were horrified. 
"People 5 feet tall are like giants to dwarfs who typically aren't taller than 
4 feet, 3 inches," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, a child is short if he is in the lowest 5% of height in a normal 
population. But if doctors were able to effectively treat all these children 
with growth hormone, they would not eliminate short stature but rather create a 
new crop of short kids -- there will always be someone in the short range of 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Where to draw the line and decide whom to treat with growth hormone is a 
dilemma we're struggling with right now," says pediatric endocrinologist Susan 
Rose of the University of New Mexico Medical Center in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of growth hormone therapy is also an issue. "We're talking 
$60,000 to $70,000 per inch," says pediatric endocrinologist Melvin Grumbach of 
UC San Francisco. "Is a few inches worth the equivalent of what it costs to 
send a kid to college?" 
</P>
<P>
Another reason not to treat a normal short child with growth hormone, Grumbach 
added, is that "the jury is still out" on the effectiveness and long-term 
safety of the therapy used on these children. "If you know a therapy is 
effective and has no risk tied to it, you do it," says endocrinologist Gordon 
Cutler of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. "But if 
both the risk and the effectiveness are uncertain, you should do nothing and 
let nature take its course, or you should enroll the patient in a clinical 
trial so we can learn what the risks and benefits are." 
</P>
<P>
There are no clear-cut health risks associated with growth hormone therapy, but 
there are some unconfirmed findings that indicate the therapy -- which usually 
consists of three injections of the hormone per week for several years -- might 
boost a person's chances of developing diabetes, hypothyroidism or leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we knew the therapy would give a person a four-inch gain in their final 
adult height rather than just a two-inch gain, the risks are probably worth 
taking," says Cutler, "but we don't know that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Since most normal children who have been tested with growth hormone therapy 
have not reached adulthood yet, their final gain in height is not known. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the parental pressure on pediatricians to treat more short 
children with growth hormone is building. "Unfortunately, everybody imbues 
growth hormone with magical qualities because we value growth so much," says 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
What decisions pediatricians make on whom to treat with growth hormone will 
have bearing on the use of future therapies likely to be developed to boost the 
appearance rather than the health of children. "If pediatricians do not respond 
to these dilemmas thoughtfully, carefully and forcefully," Cuttler wrote in her 
article, "other decision makers, whose decisions may reflect political, social 
or market forces, may then respond in ways that do not reflect the best 
interests of children."

Bone marrow transplants are helping treat some women with advanced stages of 
breast cancer, researchers from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in 
Baltimore reported at the recent San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 140,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of these patients have a recurrence of the disease in other organs, 
such as the liver, the brain and the lungs. At present, there is no effective 
treatment for advanced breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
But an autologous bone marrow transplant -- in which a portion of the patient's 
own bone marrow is removed, treated chemically to kill cancer cells and 
reimplanted -- could help some of these women. With their highly sensitive bone 
marrow removed, the patients are better able to tolerate higher doses of 
cancer-killing drugs, which are then more effective at knocking out the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, oncologist Nancy Davidson and her colleagues have performed this 
procedure on 20 patients with advanced breast cancer. Nine patients have 
responded completely; 11 showed partial responses during nine months of 
follow-up after the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen centers are using the marrow transplants to battle advanced 
breast cancer at a cost of $75,000 to $100,000 per patient.

DIVERSE L.A. DRUG CULTURE THREATENS AIDS OUTREACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paul Rosas and Ronny Alvarado were out trawling for hypes in a wild pocket of 
downtown Los Angeles, carrying the message about AIDS and dirty needles to an 
urban prairie where an addict can get high for as little as 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
A man squatted on the curb, pumping heroin into a dappled arm. Nearby, another 
guided a skillet over an open fire, sauteing fish. People stood, slumped, 
against a chain-link fence, smoking cocaine. A woman flashed a leering grin at 
Alvarado. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado approached her. Had she heard about AIDS? Did she know the risks of 
dirty needles and unprotected sex? Could she use a few condoms? Nope, the woman 
retorted perfunctorily: She was a woman; she didn't need one. 
</P>
<P>
It's not easy spreading the word about AIDS to intravenous drug users, now a 
prime target of the epidemic in Los Angeles County. The obstacles range from 
the life styles of many addicts to the complex culture of drug use in the 
nation's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Geography is destiny in Los Angeles County: The sprawl of the region has shaped 
the drug market, and thus the AIDS epidemic. The county's vastness has slowed 
the spread of AIDS among drug users, but it is making it difficult to reach 
those at greatest risk. 
</P>
<P>
In East Coast cities like New York, intravenous drug use is centralized. 
Hundreds of addicts share needles daily in shooting galleries. As a result, 
more than half of New York City's estimated 200,000 addicts are believed to be 
infected with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
But that same density makes addicts easy to find. Public health workers 
routinely canvass the shooting galleries of cities such as New York and Newark. 
They have alerted addicts to the risk of AIDS and thus helped cut down on the 
sharing of contaminated needles. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, by contrast, there are few places, except Skid Row, 
where addicts congregate in large numbers. Drug use is spread out and tends to 
occur among small groups. Those who share needles tend to do so with a few 
friends, again and again. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, and the fact that the virus came late to the West Coast, the 
HIV infection rate among addicts here appears to have remained relatively low. 
Just 3% to 5% of the county's estimated 80,000 to 120,000 intravenous drug 
users are infected, researchers believe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Reach 
</P>
<P>
But that same diffuseness makes it difficult to reach users. They are scattered 
all over the county, only occasionally in pockets. Public-health workers find 
themselves forced to go door to door, scouring neighborhoods for an entree, 
hoping to happen upon a user. 
</P>
<P>
Gangs, too, create obstacles to spreading the word. Their role in drug dealing 
creates risks for public health workers in some areas. Most outreach workers 
say they avoid working after dusk -- the time when, some acknowledge, addicts 
are most accessible. 
</P>
<P>
The county's cultural mix makes their task even more complex. In some Latino 
communities, experts say addicts are inadvertently protected. Sheltered at 
home, rather than forced out, they are harder to reach. Their families may 
offer the only access. 
</P>
<P>
"Intravenous drug use is happening all over," said John L. Brown, who runs one 
of the five county-funded programs doing outreach with addicts. "But it 
manifests itself differently depending on culture, socioeconomic circumstances 
and even the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"So what really burns me is people from San Francisco and New York who say, 
'This is how you do street outreach,' " said Brown, director of the Los Angeles 
Centers for Alcohol and Drug Abuse. "It's a much more complicated problem than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
But without effective outreach, experts believe infection inevitably will 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
Many addicts here admit they still share needles and syringes. Those who use 
bleach to sterilize their equipment say they do so only intermittently. Many 
use condoms only rarely, yet condoms offer the only means of avoiding infection 
during sex. 
</P>
<P>
One preliminary survey of 100 addicts in the San Fernando Valley found that 
needle-sharing remains common. Yet use of bleach to clean needles was 
relatively rare. Many of the users surveyed had multiple sex partners or 
frequented prostitutes, but few reported using condoms. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, county-funded AIDS outreach workers remain barred by the Board of 
Supervisors from giving out condoms or bleach -- an approach used widely 
elsewhere in the United States and abroad and credited with having helped 
change addicts' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Among the homeless, activists believe drug use is rising. Among bisexual drug 
users, as many as 30% to 40% may be infected, researchers say. Some say there 
may also be a "microepidemic" of infection among the county's prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the field see a rise in "dual addiction," especially among 
Mexican-American addicts -- the supplementing of a heroin habit with low-priced 
cocaine. They find that ominous: Dual addiction is especially risky and can be 
more difficult to treat. 
</P>
<P>
Treatment -- getting off drugs -- is the ultimate form of AIDS "risk 
reduction." But access to programs remains a problem in the county. The wait 
for admission to a subsidized program ranges from weeks to months. And the 
price often serves as a powerful deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes people comfortable (ignoring the threat of AIDS for addicts) is the 
thought that if they wanted help, they could get it," Brown said. "The reality 
is, if they all decided to kick, there's nothing for them." 
</P>
<P>
How fast the AIDS virus is spreading among drug users is not entirely clear. 
</P>
<P>
M. Douglas Anglin, who heads UCLA's Drug Abuse Research Group, has studied 
rates of infection among addicts in treatment. His findings and others suggest 
that perhaps 2% were infected in 1986 and that the rate is still below 5%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
History of Drug Use 
</P>
<P>
According to those studies, the virus appears to be "pooled" among male 
intravenous drug users with some history of homosexual activity, and among 
women intravenous drug users with some history of prostitution, Anglin said. 
</P>
<P>
But some authorities have wondered whether the findings are reliable; that is, 
are addicts in treatment representative of addicts on the street? If men and 
women in treatment are less likely to be infected, the overall rate could be 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
Anglin expressed confidence in the data. He said the county could have as much 
as a three- to-five-year grace period before the infection rate reaches that 
critical 6% to 8% level at which a rapid rise could be expected to occur. 
</P>
<P>
Who are the drug users at risk in Los Angeles County? They are as diverse as 
the county itself. They include longshoremen, physicians, mothers, truck 
drivers and prostitutes, from San Pedro and East Los Angeles to the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Their drugs of choice, and their using patterns, vary widely. Heroin remains 
dominant among Latino addicts, experts say. Cocaine has eclipsed heroin in the 
black community. Both those drugs, as well as methamphetamine and PCP, are 
widely used by Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
The following sketches hint at the extraordinary diversity of drug use in Los 
Angeles County. While the people profiled have escaped infection, their stories 
illustrate the insidious power of addiction and a life style with potentially 
lethal consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Take Cheryl, a 33-year-old mother of three from East Los Angeles, who asked not 
to be identified by her real name. Experts in drug addiction say her experience 
is common among women addicts: They fall into drug use on the heels of men. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl grew up in East Los Angeles, one of five children. Her father is a 
transit worker; one sister is an aspiring wrestler. She completed high school 
and, she says, she had little interest in drugs until she met the man who would 
become her second husband. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, faced with his growing addiction, Cheryl tried heroin. It was a 
reckless bid for attention; his drug use seemed to have shouldered her out of 
his life. She followed him into the bathroom where he was fixing, and insisted 
he inject her too. 
</P>
<P>
For several years, Cheryl used only occasionally. But when her husband began 
dealing, they both began using more often. Emerging, horrified, from a two-week 
binge, she resolved to quit. But when she tried, she became violently, 
intolerably sick. 
</P>
<P>
After her husband was sent to prison, Cheryl tried to control her habit. She 
held down a job and cared for her children. Then one day, an old connection 
showed up at the furniture warehouse where she worked. As a favor, he gave her 
some heroin to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl began dealing, and used up the rest of the supply. From there, she slid 
into prostitution. She lost jobs, was sent to jail and was briefly cut off by 
her family. She remembers spending Christmas on her parents' front porch, 
barred from the house. 
</P>
<P>
"In this type of life, it's nothing but an evil merry-go-round," she said 
recently, in an interview at a methadone-maintenance program where she is 
enrolled. "It's a vicious master, you go in a circle. It's a never-ending 
circle." 
</P>
<P>
A similar tale comes from a man who asked to identify himself only as Doc, a 
35-year-old psychologist living in Los Angeles County. He began using heroin 
while working as a drug-addiction researcher at a prominent Southern California 
university. 
</P>
<P>
Intrigued by the world of the men and women he was interviewing in motel rooms 
throughout the state, Doc began experimenting with heroin. He compares his 
curiosity to that of an apple researcher who has never tasted the fruit: "I 
wanted to taste the apple." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, he began using more frequently, driving from his home in the San 
Fernando Valley to the heart of East Los Angeles to score. Even after his wife 
overdosed, and with a 10-month-old child at home, Doc found himself powerless 
to quit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding His Life 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, he entered a residential treatment program. His wife had left 
him, taking their child. He was having difficulty holding down jobs. He has 
remained clean ever since, he says, and is in the process of piecing together 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
"It will kill you," said Doc, who, like Cheryl, escaped without becoming 
infected with the human immuno-deficiency virus, which causes AIDS. "If you're 
lucky, it will only kill you psychologically. So you have a chance for another 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to stereotypes, the life of an addict can be cruelly demanding -- in 
ways that make it difficult to get the AIDS message across. It is a life in 
which immediate needs eclipse longer-term goals, in which caution is not a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
Many addicts, for example, rise before dawn to get high. Then they turn 
immediately to the urgent business of securing their next fix -- a task that 
may entail shoplifting, theft, prostitution, moving hot goods, wheeling and 
dealing, or selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Rosas, a former addict, supported his habit for a time by ripping off 
other addicts, peddling crack vials filled with soap or peanuts. He became so 
hated on the streets that, he recalls, he could only come out at night, his 
head covered by a hood. 
</P>
<P>
Personal hygiene, even eating, often fall by the wayside. Many addicts have 
chronic health problems, from tooth decay to liver and lung disease. Suspicious 
of institutions, and sometimes mistreated by doctors, many shy away from 
medical clinics. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no reality outside of the next two to three hours," said Barbara 
Casucci, director of Cornerstone Health Services, a methadone program in Pico 
Rivera. "There's no long-term planning, no looking forward to Christmas or 
Easter. It's just how are you going to get through the next two or three 
hours." 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, among others, AIDS outreach workers have a hard job. Just 
getting the attention of an addict on the street is no small feat. What should 
be a 20-minute presentation on AIDS and how to avoid it ends up abbreviated 
into a fleeting, one-minute rap. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the problem of vocabulary -- both language and lingo. In some 
communities, adults find it difficult to talk about sex. On Skid Row, phrases 
like "intravenous drug user" are jettisoned in favor of more graphic 
alternatives such as, "D'you slam?" 
</P>
<P>
Bleach and condoms, many outreach workers say, would make their job easier. 
They would catch addicts' attention and give them something for their time. 
They would also serve as invaluable tools in explaining precisely how to 
protect oneself against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of those tools, outreach workers fall back on the power of 
repetition. By being visible on the streets, and offering repeated reminders, 
they hope they will eventually get across their point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ongoing Process' 
</P>
<P>
"These people are busy. They're trying to get money, trying to get paid, trying 
to get high," said Rosas, who does outreach along Skid Row for Brown's agency. 
"It's an ongoing process. No one's going to learn this in one shot." 
</P>
<P>
One afternoon this month, Rosas threaded his way down the crowded sidewalks of 
downtown Los Angeles making his regular rounds -- past the park where addicts 
gather, past the curbside cardboard dormitories, past hotels where 
transvestites co-habit, four to a room. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling with him was Ronny Alvarado, a 20-year-old former addict who works 
with the Homeless Outreach Project, a Skid Row agency that, among other things, 
accompanies AIDS outreach workers and makes available free condoms and bleach. 
</P>
<P>
(That agency's funding comes from the city, not the county. So it is not bound 
by the county supervisors' ban on distributing condoms and bleach.) 
</P>
<P>
The two men loped through the streets, greeting familiar faces, cajoling 
passers-by, scanning arms and necks for tracks. They offered pamphlets, 
condoms, information. Some people listened, others kept walking. A few 
protested, in mock offense, they were happily married. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't push yourself on nobody out here," explained Rosas, a 225-pound man 
with a buzz cut who put in his own time on the New York City streets. "You got 
to know when to step, when to go. If you don't, you may end up dead where you 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
Over the hills in the San Fernando Valley, three AIDS outreach workers from an 
agency called El Proyecto del Barrio were working Van Nuys, moving methodically 
from house to house on a run-down street where residents said drug deals 
regularly go down. 
</P>
<P>
There, the obstacles are different. Drug use goes on mostly behind closed 
doors. "The biggest problem is identifying where these people are," said John 
Paloma, 36, one of the outreach workers. "Then, when you've found them, it's 
convincing them we're not the police." 
</P>
<P>
The outreach workers watch for tell-tale signs: Cars pulling up outside certain 
houses, visitors returning one time too often. They ask questions: Any signs of 
drug use in the neighborhood? They hope their message makes its way into the 
right hands. 
</P>
<P>
In Paloma's experience, most addicts now know about bleach. Whether they use 
it, he cannot be certain. Most say they no longer share equipment, but Paloma 
remembers when he was using: Everyone shared because no one wanted to be caught 
carrying an outfit. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Paloma used to stash equipment around town -- for example, 
high atop public toilets. Now, working the parks, he occasionally runs a hand 
through those familiar crannies. When he comes upon a syringe, he leaves a 
pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
Are outreach programs working? In Los Angeles County, it is difficult to know. 
Most programs have been operating little more than a year. And there has been, 
so far, no comprehensive study assessing whether addicts' practices have 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
El Proyecto del Barrio, the agency that covers the San Fernando Valley, 
recently completed a survey of 100 intravenous drug users. The findings are 
preliminary and the study sample small, but the results indicate there is more 
work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharing Needles 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 75% of those surveyed said they share needles, at least occasionally. 
More than half said they clean their equipment with water -- which is 
ineffective. Only one third said they cleaned their equipment with bleach and 
water, the only proven method. 
</P>
<P>
As for sex, 33% said they had multiple partners. Nearly one in five said they 
frequented prostitutes. Yet most never use condoms and only 30% use them 
sometimes. Four people said they used them all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Changing attitudes and behavior takes time," said Kimberly Green, outreach 
project coordinator for El Proyecto del Barrio. "Eventually, they hit bottom. 
Then they become more vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
Those spreading the word say they have no grandiose expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to solve the problem of AIDS," said Mike Neely, who runs the 
Homeless Outreach Project out of a storefront in the heart of Skid Row. "What 
we're trying to do is keep the person in front of us alive long enough to deal 
with their life. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can keep the person alive 'til they're ready to hear the message, maybe 
they'll be OK," said Neely. "If they die first, all we've got is a dead drug 
addict."

LOSING SOME KEY BATTLES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

<P>
SAVANNAH, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this elegant old city of graceful mansions in muted tones, Bud Hall's House 
of Many Colors stands out like rap music at a Debussy concert. 
</P>
<P>
You can almost hear the hot pink, lavender and blue paint that covers Hall's 
nine-room Victorian home on Whitefield Square in the city's historic district. 
And his 9-foot tall windows look even louder, 10 of them covered with paintings 
of women dressed in colors of the rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
As expected in a city that prides itself on antebellum charm and architecture, 
a city that William Tecumseh Sherman spared after his March to the Sea because 
it was "too beautiful" to destroy, many Savannah preservationists look at 
Hall's home and see red. City officials took him to court, arguing that his 
home is not in character with the rest of the historic neighborhood. But Hall 
argues that preservation laws clash with his rights. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in a room that he uses for his hair styling businesses, Hall said 
indignantly: "If I want to hang pictures of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Martin Luther 
King in my window, that's my right. Our country was founded on property 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Hall's house has come to symbolize increasingly worrisome issues 
surrounding the historic preservation movement. In Savannah, as in cities 
across the country, questions are being raised about whether the movement has 
become too powerful, too intrusive and whether preservation and progress are 
compatible -- and affordable. The questions take on added weight as aging 
cities increasingly rely on historic districts to attract visitors and help 
fuel their service economies. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, preservationists are battling to hold onto power they gained 
during the last several decades of heightened awareness of architectural 
treasures. 
</P>
<P>
In Charleston, S.C., and San Francisco, preservationists have taken a beating 
as they tried to convince some victims of the recent hurricane and earthquake 
that, in repairing their damaged property, they should spend the extra money it 
takes to buy materials like those destroyed rather than purchasing newer, 
cheaper ones. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Mellen of the Preservation Society of Charleston, said to be the nation's 
oldest such organization (70 years old), said, "You have to explain to them 
that you can put an asphalt roof on," instead of the more expensive metal, "but 
you're going to lose it in 10 years. You're also going to lose tourism" because 
the houses would not be attractive. 
</P>
<P>
In South Pasadena, Calif., homeowners -- backed by the National Trust for 
Historic Preservation -- struggle against a freeway that would destroy dozens 
of historic houses. One angry homeowner called that prospect "cultural 
suicide." The preservationists can lay claim to holding off the freeway for 20 
years, but they have not been able to kill it. The state continues to press 
forward with new plans. 
</P>
<P>
In Madison, Ga., preservationists sought to block the opening of a Hardee's 
hamburger shop which would result in the razing of two historic homes in the 
quaint old east Georgia town. But they lost. The restaurant now sits just off 
the town's main square, painted white, like many of the historic homes around 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only antebellum Hardee's in the world," said Don Stacy of the local 
chamber of commerce, adding that a Piggly Wiggly grocery store is located just 
across the street from Hardee's. "I wouldn't call it an antebellum Piggly 
Wiggly," he said, "but it is a quality construction with a quality appearance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Influence Considerable 
</P>
<P>
For many years, the preservation movement made great political headway. And its 
influence is still considerable, even dominating, in many communities. 
</P>
<P>
The national trust has identified 11 areas nationwide that it calls 
"endangered," including South Pasadena, St. Simons, Ga., and the historic 
district in Deadwood, S. D. "These places tell us who we were and who we are," 
said National Trust President J. Jackson Walter. "They deserve our protection." 
</P>
<P>
But a backlash of sorts has been building, and nowhere is it more apparent than 
in Savannah, where a 2.2-square-mile historic district graced by live oak trees 
dripping Spanish moss boasts of some 1,100 historic buildings and 22 landscaped 
squares. 
</P>
<P>
Savannah is among the nation's oldest planned cities -- James Oglethorpe laid 
it out in 1733 -- and possesses one of America's largest urban historic areas 
designated as a landmark district by the U.S. Interior Department. Thus, the 
plight of its preservation Establishment could set a pattern for others 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Savannah, along with other cities like Charleston, San Antonio and Annapolis 
that have been working to preserve their history, are the recognized and 
acknowledged exemplaries of historic preservation," Walter said. "Were it ever 
to be the case when one of those cities changed direction sharply, we would, I 
am certain, be alarmed" that other preservation efforts might be thwarted. 
</P>
<P>
"When the leaders fall, everybody else gets nervous." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sweeping Control 
</P>
<P>
Preservation officials exercise broad control over how a building is modified 
and over whether one is built at all in this city of 150,000. An 11-member 
Historic Board of Review that includes architects, builders and historians must 
approve "any type of alteration that is visible from the public right of way," 
said Beth Reiter, Savannah's preservation officer. 
</P>
<P>
The board is appointed by Mayor John Rousakis and the board of aldermen, 
serving three-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
The following changes are among those requiring a "certificate of 
appropriateness" approved by the board and issued by the zoning commissioner: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Demolition of a historic structure in the historic district. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Material change in the exterior appearance of" structures in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moving a structure into, within or out of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Adding or altering awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Material change" of existing walls, fences or sidewalks that are "subject 
to view from a public street or lane." 
</P>
<P>
Under a section of the ordinance called "visual compatibility factors," there 
are 11 categories for judging new construction and proposed changes. They range 
from height to roof shape to the "rhythm" (relationship) of the buildings with 
other structures. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists argue that such considerations are not trivial, as they make a 
city palatable to visitors, thereby making money. "If we do not safeguard the 
character of our community, if we allow it to fray around the edges, people are 
not going to be interested in coming to see it," said Stephanie Churchill, 
executive director of the Historic Savannah Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Behaving Like Nazis' 
</P>
<P>
However, many here argue that focusing on the past is preventing progress for 
the future. The board is "behaving like Nazis or like czars," Hall said. 
"That's not what I want in my government." 
</P>
<P>
Many people here disparage preservation officials, and some have become local 
celebrities by defying city orders based on preservation officials' judgments. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Faber, a Savannah delicatessen owner ran up against the wrath of 
preservationists when he put up a red awning at his restaurant, located in the 
historic district -- despite the fact that his sandwiches passed strenuous 
taste tests. 
</P>
<P>
He won his fight, but his bitterness, tinged with humor, lingers. "Preserve the 
cemetery," Faber exhorts, "but don't put the businessman in it." 
</P>
<P>
One after another, he zings one-liners at preservationists: Having them sit 
around a table demanding to see paint samples is like "rearranging the deck 
chairs on the Titanic," and, "If the world stopped, it would take Savannah 25 
years to catch up." 
</P>
<P>
And just to rub in his indignation on city officials, Faber makes sure his 
bright red awning is well lighted at night, "so they don't miss it." His 
matching red window sign trumpets, in white letters, "Faber's. A Savannah 
Tradition since 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Walter of the national trust is unamused. Citing "the extraordinarily beautiful 
color of Old Savannah brick and the wonderful filigree of the wrought iron," he 
is against "turning your back on what makes the place special." 
</P>
<P>
Calling the current activist preservationist movement a "reaction against urban 
renewal," Walter said: "If there is anything we have learned over the last 20 
years, it is that the way you build a successful community is to make historic 
preservation part of the plan." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sign of Trouble 
</P>
<P>
A sign of the diminished clout of the preservationists was the construction of 
the Hyatt Regency Hotel along the Savannah River earlier in the decade. It is 
modest by many cities' standards, but here its peach-colored, boxy architecture 
looms among the historic buildings. Built by local developer Merritt W. Dixon 
III, it stands 7 stories high and has 346 rooms. The promise of its substantial 
tax revenue as the city's largest hotel overcame bitter opposition from the 
entrenched preservationist Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
But no clash over preservation values here has been more remarkable than Bud 
Hall's. 
</P>
<P>
It began in October, 1987, when Hall tried out several colors on the Queen 
Anne-style Victorian home, which was built in 1896. All the colors were 
authentic from the Victorian period, Hall said the other day, showing a visitor 
a chart called "Victorian Hues." He originally selected five colors, including 
Public House, a robin's-egg blue, and Andover, a pink. At one point he even 
painted his tin roof in pink stripes. 
</P>
<P>
The Savannah Historic Review Board pounced on Hall, slapping him with a 
stop-work order, arguing that his paint job was out of character with the rest 
of the neighborhood. "Sof-f-f-t," said Hall, derisively. "They wanted colors 
that were sof-f-f-t. Well, the Victorians were not soft. They were extremely 
eclectic. They were whimsical." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute escalated, with Hall getting hauled into court and fined $100. Last 
year, he had an artist paint women on plywood panels, asserting that the panels 
were an energy-saving measure for his windows. Preservationists and some of 
Hall's neighbors hate the panels, but they remain on the windows. 
</P>
<P>
"The windows are not a typical treatment for that style house," said Reiter in 
unaffected understatement. "It looks like stained glass." 
</P>
<P>
The house's notoriety has earned it a stop on the tour-bus route, and sometimes 
the guide toots her horn at Hall, whose home is known as "House of Many 
Colors." 
</P>
<P>
Hall now talks of bigger battles with City Hall. "I want economic change in 
this community," he said, asserting that the preservation Establishment should 
be joining him and others in that struggle instead of mounting a paint patrol. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize we need to attract business," said Reiter, but she argued that, in 
trying to curb Hall's eclecticism, she was trying to prevent "bit by bit, piece 
by piece, the unraveling of the historic district." Preservation and economic 
progress "are not mutually exclusive," Reiter said. 
</P>
<P>
But despite three decades of effort, preservationists have been unable to 
energize much of this city's commercial district, most notably Broughton Street 
and an ailing City Market, in the middle of the historic area. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent study, titled "Is Savannah Growing Senile?," a group of business 
and civic leaders calling itself Renaissance Savannah spared almost none of 
Establishment Savannah, criticizing business, political and media leaders. The 
report places the city ninth on a list of 14 Southeastern cities in population 
growth -- behind Orlando, Fla., Montgomery, Ala., and Augusta, Ga. The report 
likens Savannah to an "underdeveloped country." 
</P>
<P>
Said Julie Smith, a member of the group and a Chatham County commissioner: "The 
only industry that is growing is tourism. We need to get the city moving 
again." 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of surveys, a lot of talking, a lot of writing and not a 
damned bit of action," said one longtime business owner here. 
</P>
<P>
It is debatable how much of this restiveness can be blamed on preservationists 
blocking progress and discouraging people from coming here, but Reiter 
acknowledges that "we're the target right now. Preservation is a wonderful 
focal point." 
</P>
<P>
Bud Hall is doing all he can to keep it that way, although, he says, he has 
gone broke fighting City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after his many appearances in court, filing appeals and paying 
legal fees, he has been forced to file bankruptcy. "Lawyers aren't cheap," he 
said, estimating that his expenses have run "into the thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hall seems to relish his role as Savannah iconoclast. "I'm amused 
by the whole thing," he said. "I don't know what I'll do next." 
</P>

From Savannah, Ga., to South Pasadena, the influential historic preservation 
movement finds itself battling to retain power. As the Column One story points 
out, the controversy is perhaps best symbolized by the "House of Many Colors," 
a Victorian home in Savannah that has preservationists seeing red. Hot pink, 
lavender and blue paint cover the house. Fueling the fire, owner Bud Hall,

energy-saving measure for his windows. MATTHEW STANLEY / For The Times

ISSUE OF JAPANESE RACISM GROWS WITH IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A chance encounter on a suburban train one recent Sunday sheds some awkward 
light on the elusive problem of racism in Japan. It began when a little 
Japanese girl pointed with fascination at a black woman and asked, "Daddy, 
what's that?" 
</P>
<P>
The father squirmed with embarrassment. He tried to satisfy the innocent 
curiosity of his preschool daughter by reminding her of an old Chinese fable 
known in Japan as "Saiyuki." The man prodded the child with the name Songoku, 
hero of the tale, which is popular among children. 
</P>
<P>
Songoku is a monkey. 
</P>
<P>
The young black woman apparently did not understand enough Japanese to catch 
the indignity of this literary allusion, but she grasped the meaning of the 
child's blunt question. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a person," she told the little girl in Japanese, "just like you." 
</P>
<P>
A tense situation dissolved into gushing smiles of international goodwill when 
it was further established that the woman was an American. The child was told 
she herself is a Japanese, and that was why they were different. 
</P>
<P>
After her new "friends" got off the train, the woman confided to another 
American that she felt more irritated than insulted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same whether they're 3 or 20 years old, they stare and point," said 
the woman, who had been in Japan about a year teaching English. "Japanese are 
all children when it comes to dealing with other races." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was isolated, and does not reflect how most Japanese feel about 
people of other ethnic backgrounds. But it offers a clue as to where some 
disturbing misunderstandings begin. 
</P>
<P>
Furor has periodically erupted in the American black community over the last 
several years at news that Japanese political leaders have made disparaging 
remarks about blacks in public. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, for 
instance, drew heat in 1986 for saying America has a "low intelligence level" 
because of its black and Hispanic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese toy company, Sanrio Inc., was denounced and forced to withdraw its 
hot-selling line of "Little Black Sambo" dolls and beachwear last year after 
press reports described how these caricatures, with their thick lips and 
distorted features, were regarded here as cute rather than offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's insensitivity in matters of race does not end with negative black 
stereotypes. A recent boom in anti-Semitic books has continued without serious 
challenge from Japanese intellectuals. Members of Japan's ethnic Korean 
minority, mostly descendants of forced laborers brought here during the 
colonial period, still face discrimination in employment and marriage and only 
lately have felt comfortable using their legal Korean names. 
</P>
<P>
Now, stubborn attitudes of racial intolerance and xenophobia are bearing down 
upon the tens of thousands of Asians who have come to Japan, often staying 
illegally, to seek jobs at the lower echelons of this robust economy. While 
small-scale employers desperately need unskilled workers to correct a labor 
shortage, many Japanese oppose opening their borders for fear of increased 
crime and social disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, a local newspaper disclosed the existence of an internal police 
report that singled out Pakistanis for contempt, characterizing them as smelly 
people with skin diseases who speak poor English, get mad when they are fed 
pork without being told and tend to "lie in the name of Allah" during 
interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely necessary to wash your hands after questioning or detaining 
(Pakistani suspects) because many of them suffer from contagious skin 
diseases," said the document, a partial copy of which was obtained by The 
Times. "Since they have a unique body odor, the detention and interrogation 
rooms will stink." 
</P>
<P>
Police officials have apologized to the Pakistani Embassy and said they will 
revise the 179-page report, which was distributed in November, 1988, to 
regional authorities by the National Police Agency's International Research and 
Training Institute for Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the report was to "raise awareness" about people of an unfamiliar 
culture, but it was badly worded, said Masahiro Tamura, a senior superintendent 
in the agency's international criminal affairs division. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a sudden rise in crime by foreign visitors, but we know so little 
about other countries, especially Pakistan," Tamura said. "We thought it would 
be a good idea to say a few things about what kind of country it is, and give a 
few examples." 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide arrests of Pakistanis increased by more than five times since 1985, 
to 78 cases in 1988. As many as 1,643 Chinese and Taiwanese were arrested last 
year, but they were not mentioned in the agency's training manual. 
</P>
<P>
Police are not the only ones with a low regard for Pakistanis, whose relatively 
dark skin makes them stand out among other Asian visitors drawn to Japan by the 
high yen and plentiful work. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Kawaguchi, an industrial city in Saitama Prefecture (state) with a 
large population of foreign workers, complained to a symposium on immigrant 
labor earlier this month that "some Pakistanis embarrass staff at public bath 
houses because they do not remove their underwear when bathing," according to 
Kyodo News Service. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Yoji Nagase also reportedly quipped that "Japanese people could bump into 
Pakistanis at night because of their dark skin." Nagase later insisted his 
remarks did not imply racial prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
In September, authorities at Warabi High School, also in Saitama, barred a 
19-year-old Pakistani from working as a teacher's aide in an English class. 
School officials told the Mainichi newspaper that the man was "a suspicious 
person" and that "there are a lot of communicable diseases and crime among 
Pakistanis." 
</P>
<P>
Similar bias is encountered by workers from Bangladesh, who, like those from 
Pakistan, were able to come to Japan as tourists -- without visas -- until 
Tokyo tightened its immigration rules in April. A new law will soon require 
foreigners to produce certification of visa status before they can work. 
Employers will be face penalties for hiring illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese consider themselves a single race, and they think their society 
will become dirty if foreigners come in," said a Bangladeshi businessman who 
has lived here for 13 years -- and who asked not be identified by name to avoid 
antagonizing his Japanese friends. "This attitude is deep in their hearts. 
There's no proof of it, but if you talk to people you're made to understand." 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, Japanese have considered themselves victims of racial 
discrimination for decades, and not entirely without cause. Japanese and 
Chinese immigrants were deprived of civil rights in the United States earlier 
this century during the regrettable era of "Yellow Peril," and a generation of 
Japanese-Americans was confined to U.S. concentration camps after the attack on 
Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
A sense of persecution weighed heavily in Japan's decision to go to war with 
the United States, and its territorial conquests were rationalized as an 
attempt to liberate the region from Western colonial masters. That view remains 
current among the powerful right wing of the political leadership, as 
illustrated last year when Land Agency Chief Seisuke Okuno was forced to resign 
his Cabinet post after declaring that Japan had justifiably fought against 
Asian colonization by the "white race." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, defenders of Japan's whaling industry routinely attack environmental 
critics as racially motivated, and some observers see the specter of racism 
lurking behind the emotional backlash by some Americans against the recent 
surge of Japanese investment in the United States. They point out that there 
are few complaints about corporate takeovers by the British. 
</P>
<P>
One hawkish lawmaker, Shintaro Ishihara, rattled nerves in Washington earlier 
this year by asserting in a book of essays that "racism is at the base of 
U.S.-Japan trade friction." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite this apparent gulf in communication, the Japanese have attempted 
to repair damaged feelings in some of the most highly visible cases of racial 
insensitivity. The Foreign Ministry issued a memorandum to the publishing 
industry in September warning of Jewish revulsion toward a recent spate of 
Japanese bestsellers that postulate Zionist conspiracies behind world events. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the books may "offend the most sensitive areas of Jewish psychology," 
the memorandum said. "The fact that such anti-Semitic works are published 
unchallenged and without criticism in Japan calls into question the common 
sense of the Japanese people." 
</P>
<P>
Government and publishing industry officials have so far responded positively 
to complaints, "partly because it's bad for business," said Neil C. Sandberg, 
director of the American Jewish Committee's Pacific Rim Institute, who recently 
visited Tokyo with a delegation of Jewish leaders. "But part of it represents a 
new understanding. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have had very limited exposure to cultural differences for many 
centuries and developed a sense of uniqueness that tends to encourage either 
indifference or negative feelings toward foreigners," Sandberg said. "There's a 
vacuum here because there's so little information about the Jews. We're worried 
that these books may fill that void with negative stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
The potential for exporting intolerance also worries Sandberg, who noted that 
the work of one of the most scurrilous anti-Semitic writers, Masami Uno, has 
been translated into Korean. 
</P>
<P>
Questions also have been raised about employment practices of Japanese 
companies with operations abroad. Earlier this year, former employees of a U.S. 
subsidiary of Recruit Co., the job-placement firm of political bribery scandal 
fame, alleged that a secret code had been used to discriminate among applicants 
on the basis of race and sex. When a client wanted to hire a Japanese or a 
Latino, for example, the names "Mariko" or "Maria" were allegedly jotted on 
internal memos. 
</P>
<P>
In an echo of former Prime Minister Nakasone's slur about U.S. ethnic 
diversity, a significant number of Japanese -- two out of five -- believe that 
America's major economic problem is that it has too many minorities, according 
to a recent Harris Poll cited in the magazine Business Week. 
</P>
<P>
There are some encouraging signs of changing attitudes, however. Hajime Arita, 
a 10-year-old, and his parents started a family campaign to fight racism in 
Japan after reading about the "Little Black Sambo" controversy. They visited 
Washington in August to meet black leaders and promote better understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese booksellers have removed copies of the children's book "Little Black 
Sambo" from their shelves, and several companies have joined Sanrio in phasing 
out products and designs featuring derogatory caricatures of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
But the caricatures, essentially borrowed from the symbols of America's own 
past, still proliferate on the Japanese landscape in signs and advertising 
images. 
</P>
<P>
One such eyesore is the sign outside a tiny pub in Tokyo's Ebisu neighborhood, 
which calls itself "Chibi Kuro Sambo" -- Japanese for Little Black Sambo. 
Inside is a log-cabin decor with comical black dolls displayed on the window 
sill. The Japanese waitress has her hair set in a style resembling African 
dreadlocks and wears a red gingham smock. Specialties on the menu are "little 
black fried chicken" and "little black potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Sachiko Sasaki does not see why there is such a fuss over the theme she 
chose for her pub nine years ago. She has no plans to change the name. 
</P>
<P>
"This had nothing to do with racial prejudice or how I feel about black 
people," Sasaki said. "I've always thought Little Black Sambo was cute." 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Bureau research assistant Takeshi Yabe also contributed to this story.

<TEXT>
<P>
A Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese communications satellites roared 
into space Sunday night after nine postponements as Martin Marietta Corp. 
entered the commercial launch business. 
</P>
<P>
The 155-foot-tall booster blasted away from its launch pad at the Cape 
Canaveral Air Force Station at 7:07 p.m. and gave thousands of spectators a 
dazzling New Year's Eve show, brilliantly lighting the night sky as it climbed 
toward orbit. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything looks good," mission commentator Bob Gordon reported as the rocket 
sped into space. Twenty minutes after liftoff mission director Vic Whitehead 
reported the Titan 3 upper stage carrying the satellites had achieved a 
successful orbit ranging from 117 to 437 miles high. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan got away on its 10th attempt. Originally set for Dec. 7, the launch 
was delayed once by a technical problem and eight times by strong, high 
altitude winds. The wind was no problem Sunday night and the countdown 
proceeded without a hitch to an on-time liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
Packed in the nose cone of the most powerful U.S. commercial rocket were the 
14,700-pound JCSAT-2 and the 3,230-pound Skynet 4 satellites. 
</P>
<P>
Skynet 4A was ejected from the Titan's nose cone into its planned preliminary 
orbit a little more than an hour after launch and JCSAT 2 followed about an 
hour and a half later. On-board rocket motors were to boost the relay stations 
to their operational altitude of 22,300 miles. 
</P>
<P>
JCSAT-2 will complete a two-satellite Japanese domestic network, providing 
telephone, television, facsimile and high-speed data services. It is owned by 
the Japanese Communications Satellite Co. 
</P>
<P>
Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for communicating with 
land, sea and air forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese company and British government share the $125-million cost of the 
rocket and launch services provided by Martin Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
Roaring with power, the Titan's boosters burned out about two minutes after 
liftoff as planned and fell away into the Atlantic Ocean. The liquid-fueled 
Titan "core" vehicle then continued the ascent, looking like a brilliant star 
as the vehicle disappeared to the east. 
</P>
<P>
The flight plan called for Skynet 4 to be deployed from the Titan's 
second-stage nose cone one hour and 12 minutes after liftoff. JCSAT-2 was to 
follow suit about an hour and a half after that. 
</P>
<P>
The Titan 3, built at Martin Marietta's Denver plant, is the second big U.S. 
rocket to enter the commercial market, launching payloads for a fee. McDonnell 
Douglas was the first, with its Delta rocket hoisting a communications 
satellite for British Satellite Broadcasting in August. 
</P>
<P>
General Dynamics plans to enter the competition next year with its Atlas 
rocket. 
</P>
<P>
The three U.S. companies are competing with the European Space Agency's Ariane 
rocket.

POLK, Neb. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The land is tabletop flat between the Big Blue and Platte rivers, a good place 
to get a clear view of the world: the bright red and orange sunsets of summer 
and fall, the harsh winter winds that whip through small towns like freight 
trains, and, come springtime, the return of migrating birds and the lush 
prairie plant life. 
</P>
<P>
"To stand centered in a 360-degree horizon," Norris W. Alfred once wrote, "is 
to experience a natural worldliness, colorful and complete." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred, editor and publisher of the Polk Progress, not only mirrored the 
richness of the Nebraska horizon, but also used it as a place from which he 
could comment on the world. The demise of the 82-year-old weekly newspaper, 
which published its final issue last week, is being mourned by 900 avid 
subscribers in 45 states. 
</P>
<P>
The breadth of the subscription list -- including 75 from California -- is more 
of a tribute to Alfred than to Polk, which he described as a town of "384 
friendly citizens and one grouch." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred, 76, is a left-wing populist in a solidly Republican state who likes to 
rail against government secrecy, big businesses, big machines that destroy 
family farms, chemicals that deplete precious topsoil, and any Republican 
within striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
Many newspapers have creeds and slogans, but Alfred has a mantra, "Slower Is 
Better," which appears, along with a snail, on the masthead of the eight-page 
newspaper. Type for the Progress was set on a hot-metal Linotype and the paper 
was printed on a 100-year-old big cylinder Babcock printing press in a cramped 
Main Street office. 
</P>
<P>
The Progress could be anyone's hometown paper, featuring such pictures as Wilma 
Flick with her large turnip. But it's the features, mostly written by Alfred, 
that set the paper apart: the folksy Polking Around, the weather, an 
impassioned editorial and a bird-watching column; Alfred, who once supported 
himself as a water colorist, does pen-and-ink drawings for the paper. 
</P>
<P>
The birding column is an opportunity not only to count birds, but, Alfred said, 
"to point out the necessity for leaving trees, bushes and water in the land as 
part of the birds' livable environment. It's an extension of what students 
learn in kindergarten and maybe preschool -- sharing." 
</P>
<P>
The weather column is unusual because it is never wrong -- it eschews forecasts 
-- but it can make a political point: "This week's weather had Siberian 
temperature readings in the deep-freeze range accompanied by a secretive 
military mission of the space shuttle" (Feb. 7, 1985). 
</P>
<P>
Away from a typewriter, the soft-spoken bachelor observes that "loco" residents 
sometimes bristle at his politics, but they seem to have provided him with an 
endless source of good copy. None is more quotable than Alvena Lind, who is in 
her 80s and the leader of a three-woman team of paper folders, whose job is to 
crease and fold the sheets of the paper into a manageable whole when it comes 
off the press. A daughter once criticized Alvena for talking too much. "If you 
don't talk," replied Alvena, "you never say anything." She also campaigns 
regularly against sloth: "If you don't do anything, you get out of practice." 
</P>
<P>
Alfred, of Swedish ancestry, never had to worry about a work ethic. He writes 
most of his columns before the farmers get up. A Polk native, he worked briefly 
for the Progress after graduating from high school in 1931, and became an 
itinerant pressman and printer (he has a degree in chemistry from Doane College 
in Crete, Neb.). 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1950s, he came back to Polk to help his ailing parents who owned a 
clothing store and several farms. In 1955, he bought the Progress with a small 
loan and monthly payments of $100. Alfred soon realized he had acquired a 
suspect printing business with old machines, a leaky roof and a precarious 
future. Then a farmer named John Hultman came in and renewed his subscription, 
telling Alfred: "I better pay for two years, then I don't have to come to town 
so often." 
</P>
<P>
With two years to prove himself, Alfred knew then his wandering days were over, 
except for a yearlong absence in the early 1960s. The Progress, by Alfred's own 
account, was not anything remarkable until the Vietnam War, when he decided it 
was pointless fighting the Vietnamese when the United States really wanted to 
fight Russians -- and said so. 
</P>
<P>
His national following started to build in the late 1970s when some San 
Francisco State University journalism teachers discovered Alfred (they 
nominated him for a Pulitzer Prize in 1980). 
</P>
<P>
Alfred announced his retirement last September and tried to sell the paper for 
$25,000, but couldn't find any takers. He may start a newsletter, but the 
Progress is gone.

The mayor of this northern town says that Roman Catholic Church officials have 
sent him a bill for more than $20,000 for a series of special Masses celebrated 
since 1630. 
</P>
<P>
The church said the town requested the special Masses in the 17th Century when 
it was troubled by the plague. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Giuliano Gaigher said Saturday that church authorities are now insisting 
on payment of 10,000 lire (about $9) for each of seven votive Masses celebrated 
each year since 1630. That would bring the total bill to about $22,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing historical research. We haven't found any commitment by the town" 
to pay for the Masses, Gaigher said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian news agency ANSA quoted local church officials as saying they are 
willing to work out a solution.

President Bush on Sunday sent a television greeting to the Soviet people, 
offering "warmest greetings" for the New Year and for "a new world of our own 
making." 
</P>
<P>
In a video message to be broadcast on Soviet television, Bush praised Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as "a good partner in peace." 
</P>
<P>
A companion message taped by Gorbachev is expected to be aired on U.S. 
television, continuing an exchange begun by Gorbachev and former President 
Ronald Reagan in the mid-1980s. It was not immediately clear when either 
message would be broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the war-torn history of this century, we should redouble our efforts to 
forge a new century of peace and freedom," said Bush, who is vacationing in 
Texas but who taped the message in Washington before he left. 
</P>
<P>
Bush noted that "our nations have produced" leaders such as Abraham Lincoln, 
Soviet novelist Leo Tolstoy, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and 
Soviet dissident Andrei D. Sakharov. 
</P>
<P>
"We have persevered as allies in a terrible war," he said. "The challenges we 
face today are no less daunting. But with good will and determination on both 
sides, I am confident our two peoples will be equal to the task." 
</P>
<P>
Bush reiterated that the United States "seeks no advantage from the 
extraordinary changes under way" in Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
With tears, clapping and shouts of "Viva Panama!" passengers made an emotional 
return to Panama on Sunday morning on the first commercial flight to enter 
since U.S. troops invaded and ousted strongman Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"We made it. Long live Panama!" yelled one woman who joined some 200 passengers 
in wild clapping and cheering as Eastern Airlines Flight 4977 touched down. 
</P>
<P>
"Panama is so beautiful, so beautiful," she repeated over and over. 
</P>
<P>
Another woman, unable to contain her emotions, could do nothing but sob. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great. This is incredible," said one Panamanian businessman who has 
lived in self-exile in the United States since March, 1988. He said he will 
stay only a week now but plans to move back to Panama with his family by the 
end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Though all of the passengers interviewed said they were relieved that Noriega 
was ousted, many were nervous about criticizing him, and all asked not to 
quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
Omar Torrijos International Airport, named after Panama's previous leader, has 
been transformed by the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The Panama Defense Forces, which under Noriega took over control of the ports 
and customs and immigration services, had exercised absolute control over the 
facility, lending it a sometimes sinister atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers known for their opposition to Noriega were in the past forced off 
planes by members of the PDF, harassed as they passed through immigration or 
denied re-entry. Journalists were sometimes detained and interrogated by 
suspicious PDF officers. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, travelers reacted with pleasure as heavily armed U.S. troops offered 
New Year's greetings and the country's new civilian director of immigration 
welcomed them to "our new Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Jose Chen Barria, a member of the opposition Christian Democratic Party, was 
cheered when he introduced himself as the new immigration head and welcomed the 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
Chen acknowledged that although immigration is now run by civilians, the 
airport remains under U.S. military control. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a military zone," he told passengers. "The U.S. Army is in control 
here." 
</P>
<P>
The airport had been a principal target of U.S. forces when their invasion was 
launched Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops brought the airport under control after heavy fighting, and a 
hostage standoff was defused when U.S. forces persuaded Panamanian troops to 
release two American women, saying Noriega had been captured. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, as the first commercial flight arrived, there was still evidence of 
a strong U.S. military presence. 
</P>
<P>
Armed servicemen met passengers at the door of the airplane. Others were 
stationed throughout the main terminal. Jeeps full of soldiers were stationed 
along the runways, and a U.S. military helicopter hovered nearby while the 
Eastern aircraft taxied to the terminal.

AQUINO RESHUFFLES CABINET BUT KEEPS RAMOS; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: THE SHAKE-UP IS UNLIKELY TO SATISFY THE REBELS OR OTHER CRITICS, 
ANALYSTS SAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
One month after a coup nearly toppled her from power, President Corazon Aquino 
announced sweeping changes in her Cabinet on Sunday, including a new chief of 
the nation's much-criticized civilian intelligence services. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino removed seven of her 22 Cabinet ministers and moved several others to 
new posts. It was the broadest Cabinet shake-up since she assumed power four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino did not accede to growing pressure to oust Defense Secretary Fidel 
V. Ramos, whose military has now mutinied six times against her government, or 
announce new policies to solve the nation's growing social and economic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet shake-up came as rebel leaders declared a cease-fire for the New 
Year's weekend, ending for the moment nearly daily rumors and press reports of 
another coup or assassination attempt. The Dec. 1-9 military revolt left at 
least 113 dead and more than 500 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said much of the Cabinet reshuffle appeared more cosmetic than 
substantive. They said it was unlikely to satisfy rebel leaders and military 
and civilian critics, who charge that Aquino's administration is corrupt and 
inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino won critical support in a strongly worded pastoral letter that was 
read in thousands of churches before millions of parishioners Sunday morning 
across Asia's only Roman Catholic country. 
</P>
<P>
"The staging of a coup d'etat . . . is a rebellion . . . against God, from whom 
all civil authority is derived," the nation's bishops declared in the letter. 
"In other words, to seize power through a coup d'etat is a sin." 
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the faithful could not stand idly by during a coup, which 
it called "a morally neutral stand." 
</P>
<P>
The church leaders, led by Manila's archbishop, Cardinal Jaime Sin, conceded 
that there is abuse of power, incompetence and graft under Aquino. "Our 
government must get its act together," the church leaders warned, calling for 
"profound" and "thoroughgoing reforms." 
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised appearance, Aquino said that she reorganized her 
Cabinet to "adjust to new situations" and to improve deteriorating government 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Her spokesman, Adolfo Azcuna, later told reporters that the changes were 
"triggered not so much by the coup attempt but by the same reasons that 
precipitated the coup attempt. It's something you might say is parallel." 
</P>
<P>
Azcuna said the new Cabinet "should be an action team. The time for action is 
long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
The most significant change appeared to be the sacking of Rodolfo Canieso, who 
ran the National Intelligence Coordinating Authority, the Philippine equivalent 
of the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
Philippine intelligence apparently failed to detect the most recent revolt, in 
which an estimated 3,000 heavily armed rebel troops quickly captured the 
nation's top military bases and then laid siege to Manila's financial district. 
In his defense, Canieso said later that a majority of the armed forces did not 
oppose the coup. 
</P>
<P>
Before running the intelligence agency, Canieso was commander of the army and 
head of a right-wing anti-Communist group. Under his tenure, the army helped 
foster dozens of rural vigilante groups who were blamed for hundreds of human 
rights abuses, including brutal beatings and deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Canieso was replaced with retired Maj. Gen. Mariano Adalem, who also was named 
presidential consultant on military affairs. Adalem had commanded the 
Philippine army until he was appointed head of the National Casino Authority in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino did not remove Defense Secretary Ramos or armed forces Chief of 
Staff Renato de Villa. Opposition politicians and even some of Aquino's closest 
aides had demanded that both be ousted for failing to forestall the latest 
military uprising. Ramos was a prime target of the coup attempt, and rebel 
leaders have made his removal a key demand. 
</P>
<P>
Ramos helped start the initial military-civilian revolt that swept Aquino to 
power in 1986. He has been her closest and most trusted military adviser since 
then and is considered a front-runner in the 1992 presidential election, when 
her term expires. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Magno, an associate professor of political science at the University of 
the Philippines, said Aquino could not replace Ramos easily, since he is the 
only civilian respected by a large segment of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be unwise to make dramatic changes in the military now," Magno said. 
"It's not politically feasible. It might disturb a very precarious 
equilibrium." 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts said that Aquino's failure to remove several key aides was as 
noteworthy as the shifts she made. She did not, for example, replace Jose S. 
Concepcion Jr., secretary of trade and industry, or Mita Pardo de Tavera, head 
of social welfare and development. 
</P>
<P>
Concepcion's longtime tenure as trade czar has been marked by widespread 
accusations by foreign businessmen and local officials of inefficiency, 
incompetence and possible corruption. Concepcion broke into tears several 
months ago while defending himself in a congressional hearing, which examined 
allegations that his own companies had profited from his official actions. 
</P>
<P>
Tavera, who has served in the Cabinet since Aquino came to power, has been 
criticized even by Aquino's inner circle for failing to deliver basic social 
services in rural provinces. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts applauded Aquino's removal of Education Secretary Lourdes 
Quisumbing in favor of Isidro Carino, the highly regarded president of 
University of the East, one of Manila's largest universities. Quisumbing has 
presided over an education system that has seen illiteracy grow, a decline in 
the number of schools, a lack of textbooks and other major problems. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino also won kudos for replacing Transportation Secretary Rainerio Reyes 
with Oscar Orbos, one of the Philippines' most active congressmen and sponsor 
of a bill that would boost small business in rural areas. Under Reyes, public 
transportation in the capital has deteriorated dramatically in the past year, 
with a shortage of buses, rising fares and a series of crippling strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino moved her labor secretary, Franklin Drilon, to head the justice 
department. He replaces Sedfrey Ordonez, who had vowed to resign if he did not 
catch any "big fish" in corruption or organized crime by year's end. Although 
he did not succeed, Ordonez was named new ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy struggling to recover from the coup's bloody fighting, Aquino 
replaced both her finance secretary and the head of the central bank. She also 
named a new secretary to run the land reform program, which has been plagued by 
scandal and charges that the Aquino family sugar cane plantation used a 
loophole to avoid distributing land. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino also appointed new secretaries for agriculture, economic planning, labor 
and a new press secretary. Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who will head 
negotiations on whether to renew leases for U.S. military bases in the 
Philippines, was retained.

FUNDAMENTALIST AFGHAN REBELS REPORTED HANGED

Several fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla leaders were hanged at a public 
gathering inside Afghanistan for murdering about 30 moderate moujahedeen rebels 
last summer, a spokesman for the Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla group said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Fundamentalist Hizb-i-Islami commander Syed Jamal Agha was hanged along with 
several other of the group's commanders in Taloqan on Dec. 23, Jamaat-i-Islami 
spokesman Umar Sherdil said, confirming reports published Sunday in local 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Sherdil told journalists that Agha and a "few" other Hizb-i-Islami commanders 
were publicly hanged in the city's main park in the presence of 43 leading 
elders from northern Afghanistan. He said that a large number of people 
witnessed the execution. 
</P>
<P>
The executions are the latest in a series of assassinations among moujahedeen 
guerrillas and politicians in Afghanistan and in refugee camps in Pakistan as 
Muslim fundamentalists struggle with moderates for control over the 5 million 
Afghan refugees and the rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
A Jamaat-i-Islami member who claimed to have witnessed the executions said Agha 
was questioned in the park and accused by many people present of having killed 
their relatives and friends. 
</P>
<P>
The commander reportedly told them that he had killed hundreds of people in the 
fighting against Soviet and Soviet-backed Afghanistan government forces and 
couldn't identify them. 
</P>
<P>
He was also reported to have confessed his role in the murders of about 30 
Jamaat-i-Islami commanders and moujahedeen in an ambush last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Hizb-i-Islami is a hard-line fundamentalist Afghan guerrilla group seeking to 
create an Islamic state in Kabul. Jamaat-i-Islami, while also strongly Islamic, 
is more moderate. 
</P>
<P>
Hizb-i-Islami has been particularly envious of the charismatic and successful 
Jamaat-i-Islami commander, Ahmed Shah Masoud, who was reportedly the target of 
the massacre.

SINGAPORE'S PREMIER SAYS HE WILL RETIRE AT END OF 1990

<P>
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who turned a colonial backwater into a modern 
industrial giant, announced Sunday that he will step down from the post he has 
held for 30 years before the end of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In his New Year's message, the 66-year-old Lee said First Deputy Prime Minister 
Goh Chok Tong will be his successor, ending speculation that he would 
immediately pass the post on to his son, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien 
Loong. 
</P>
<P>
Lee, the country's first and only prime minister, has made it clear he is not 
retiring but has said in the past that he will become a senior Cabinet 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
Western observers expect he will retain veto power on all critical decisions 
and leave the day-to-day running of the country up to his handpicked second 
generation of leaders, including his 37-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Although Goh, 48, has said he expects Lee Hsien Loong to eventually follow him 
in the No. 1 job, he ruled out any interim label for himself by making it clear 
he expects to run for prime minister in the next election in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Kuan Yew, who has been in control from the time Singapore achieved 
self-rule in 1959 and full independence from Britain in 1965, said the country 
of 2.6 million residents "enters the 1990s with its people and leaders 
confident that they have pulled together when the going got rough, and can do 
so again." 
</P>
<P>
"For Asia and the Pacific, a sound relationship between America and Japan is 
crucial to stability and growth," Lee said. He noted this "may be more 
difficult in the future without a common threat from the Soviet Bloc," which 
has been swept by democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He exhorted his countrymen to "let the 1990s be the decade when Singapore comes 
of age as a developed country." 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a decade of self-renewal," Lee said of the 1980s. "A new 
generation has assumed leadership positions in the Cabinet, Parliament and the 
public service. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the end of 1990, Goh Chok Tong will take over as prime minister," Lee 
said, in his most explicit statement yet about relinquishing the prime 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics, however, recalled that five years ago, Lee indicated he would retire 
at 65.

The city of Fresno filed a $650-million lawsuit against three international 
firms that sold the pesticide DBCP that ended up polluting city wells. The 
pesticide contamination has forced closure of nearly three-dozen city wells. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup costs could total tens of millions of dollars. City Councilman Craig 
Scharton said Friday that he does not believe taxpayers should have to foot the 
bill for a mess created by private companies. Named in the suit, which was 
filed in San Francisco Superior Court, are Shell Oil, Occidental Petroleum Co., 
Dow Chemical and distributors of the cancer-causing pesticide that was banned 
in the late 1970s but is expected to remain in San Joaquin Valley ground water 
supplies for the next 50 to 100 years. At least two other San Joaquin Valley 
cities, Sanger and Kingsburg, have pending suits against the pesticide 
companies dating back six years.

A small earthquake struck 24 miles southwest of Palm Springs. There were no 
reports of damage or injury in the magnitude 3.1 temblor, which was in a remote 
desert area, said Bob Finn, a spokesman for Caltech in Pasadena. The quake was 
not related to a series of small temblors that struck last week along the San 
Jacinto fault from San Bernardino to east of Palm Springs, Finn said.

Police in San Jose arrested the father of a 3-year-old boy who was jabbed by a 
cocaine-filled hypodermic needle while trying to break up a fight between the 
parents. David Kennard, 24, was arrested at his home and booked on suspicion of 
assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities planned to test him for any diseases that might have been passed to 
the boy through the needle. Tests conducted on the boy after he was stuck with 
the needle showed no significant amounts of cocaine had entered his system. 
Kennard and the boy's mother, Charlene Ann Lemon, were reportedly arguing about 
Kennard's cocaine use when the boy tried to stop the dispute, police said. 
During the argument, Kennard was waving a syringe and the boy was jabbed in a 
finger, officers said.

CONGRESSMEN'S AGENDAS FOCUS ON NATIONAL ISSUES; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: CLEAN AIR, IMMIGRATION REFORM, VIDEOCASSETTE COPYRIGHT PROTECTION 
AND AIDS TESTING ARE OF INTEREST TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among other items on his sweeping 1990 legislative agenda, Rep. Henry A. Waxman 
(D-Los Angeles) aspires to overhaul the Clean Air Act and place stricter limits 
on agricultural pesticide residue on fruits and vegetables. He also hopes to 
require food manufacturers to provide detailed labeling of products and 
scientific support for health claims. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), meanwhile, is seeking immigration 
reform that would increase the number of visas for family members of permanent 
U.S. residents. He is also sponsoring a bill to ban "black boxes," which are 
used to make unauthorized copies of videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
Among his modest legislative goals, Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) 
continues to carry a measure that would empower federal courts to impose the 
death sentence for the killing of federal law enforcement officers. The same 
proposal failed to move in the last session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
These six measures are a sampling of the 54 diverse bills that the five San 
Fernando Valley-area members introduced this year and hope to see enacted in 
1990. The proposals generally deal with national issues rather than local 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, some of the laws -- such as the Clean Air Act, immigration reform, 
videocassette copyright protection and Waxman's efforts to provide early 
confidential AIDS testing and counseling -- are of particular interest to 
Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, these health issues have impact on my constituents as they have on 
people throughout the country," said Waxman, whose 24th District includes 
Universal City and parts of North Hollywood and Los Feliz as well as the 
Beverly-Fairfax area, Hollywood and Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives carried in the 101st Congress by Waxman, Berman, Gallegly and 
by Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los Angeles) and Carlos J. Moorhead 
(R-Glendale) reflect the lawmakers' legislative priorities as well as their 
place in the Capitol Hill hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman expects to pass some of his far-reaching bills, although struggles 
remain over important specifics; Berman may see provisions of his immigration 
bill incorporated into a broad reform package and would like to move other 
proposals, and Beilenson hopes that his politically risky measures in favor of 
a tax increase and public campaign financing will at least inspire discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Moorhead and Gallegly, as members of the Republican minority, face uphill 
battles over their narrower legislative priorities. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley members' initiatives are among 4,842 measures introduced by House 
members in 1989, the first year of the two-year session. Overall, 93 bills and 
resolutions have been enacted, which is typical of an institution that tends to 
creep along until adjournment approaches and then engages in a lawmaking 
frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
Even then, most proposals fail to negotiate the legislative labyrinth. Success 
often comes by folding the provisions of a bill into a broader measure that 
appears headed for passage, persuading senior colleagues to sponsor an 
initiative or influencing behind-the-scenes negotiations and policy committee 
actions. For Republicans such as Moorhead, this may mean getting a Democrat to 
adopt their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
And it often takes more than one session of Congress to get something done. 
Thus, many of the Valley-area lawmakers' proposals are carried over from 
previous sessions when they failed to go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
For the third time, for instance, Beilenson is sponsoring a bill to increase 
the federal gasoline tax by 50 cents a gallon over a five-year period to reduce 
the federal deficit and another to publicly finance congressional general 
election campaigns. For the fourth time, he has reintroduced a measure to 
double the safety standard for automobile bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the sort of thing he likes to leave there so people will talk about 
it," said a legislative aide to Beilenson. 
</P>
<P>
After two unsuccessful attempts to expand patent protection for industrial 
designs of such items as luggage, telephones and automobile parts, Moorhead 
says that new-found backing by key colleagues and the Bush Administration may 
portend passage. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we will get it through eventually," Moorhead said last week. "I 
wouldn't guarantee this Congress. We're building more and more support for it 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, a legislative power as chairman of the influential health and 
environment subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is 
carrying numerous major bills and plans to introduce others. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Clean Air, food labeling, pesticide and AIDS measures, he is 
pushing bills to establish standards and routine inspections of fish to detect 
chemical contamination; toughen the Food and Drug Administration's oversight of 
medical devices; increase the number of community residential programs for the 
mentally retarded and authorize Medicaid to pay for home health care for the 
poor elderly rather than restricting coverage to nursing home costs. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman said last week that he also plans to sponsor a bill to further restrict 
cigarette promotion and advertising and sale to minors. Stiff opposition from 
the powerful tobacco lobby is expected. 
</P>
<P>
This is not unusual. On many of his initiatives, Waxman is opposed by the Bush 
Administration as well as by private industry. 
</P>
<P>
A senior agriculture official testified in May that Waxman's bill to change the 
standard for cancer-causing carcinogenic pesticide residue on food from a 
balancing of health and economic concerns to strictly health considerations 
would have a disastrous impact on food prices and the food supply. The measure 
is one of several introduced in the wake of widespread fears prompted by use of 
the chemical Alar on apples. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman, in turn, adamantly opposes a pesticide-control bill by the White House 
that would tighten registration requirements and stiffen sanctions against 
violators but would also prevent states from imposing more stringent pesticide 
restrictions. Environmentalists in California are seeking to place a tough 
environmental initiative on the 1990 ballot that would phase out all 
agricultural chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive injury by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Waxman's subcommittee chairmanship has allowed him to assemble a large and 
respected staff, hold frequent hearings and aggressively pursue a liberal 
agenda that includes protecting consumers and fighting for benefits for the 
poor, elderly and infirm. 
</P>
<P>
He possesses "an instinct for the legislative process that is second to none, a 
thorough knowledge of the rules and willingness to exploit every one and a 
temperament that is all but unflappable," said the 1988 edition of "The 
American Almanac of Politics." 
</P>
<P>
Berman, an ally of Waxman's, has established clout on the House Judiciary 
Committee, particularly on immigration and copyright issues. As a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, he also has become a player on some international 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Berman passed a far-reaching bill that prohibits all arms sales, 
whether publicly known or covert, to countries placed on a so-called "terrorist 
list" by the secretary of state unless the President provides Congress with 
prior notice and detailed justification. Berman introduced the measure in 
response to the Iran arms sales scandal. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to prevent the spread of ballistic missiles, he also has sponsored 
a bill to require the President to impose sanctions against companies that 
export missile technology in violation of U.S. export-control laws. Under the 
measure, which overwhelmingly passed the House this year, foreign companies 
that sell this technology to countries such as Libya or Iraq would face the 
prospect of being cut off from U.S. Department of Defense contracts. 
</P>
<P>
On immigration, as Congress moves to revise the 24-year-old U.S. visa-allotment 
system, Berman is pushing for expansion of visas in general and is championing 
the reunification of family members of those who have become permanent U.S. 
residents. Berman maintains this should remain the cornerstone of national 
immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, have sought to shift the overall emphasis toward immigrants' 
education and employment skills. This is intended to open the doors for more 
Western Europeans, who have been largely shut out by the current system's bias 
toward regions with more recent immigrants, who thus have more immediate 
relatives in the United States. These regions include parts of Asia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Berman is also carrying a bill that he has previously introduced twice. The 
measure, sought by the American Civil Liberties Union, would remove the 
President's authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from spending money in 
countries against which the United States has an economic embargo -- which 
effectively prohibits travel to places such as Cuba, Vietnam and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Berman passed a provision of his original bill last year that eliminated the 
ban on exporting and importing informational materials, such as films, 
newspapers and books, to and from embargoed countries. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson's significant legislative roles are, by their very nature, low 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
He sits on the important but largely anonymous House Rules Committee, which 
controls the flow of legislation and determines the limits of debate on the 
House floor. He is chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence, which provides oversight and approves the budgets for the CIA and 
other intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson tends to be less of a force on other legislation. His tax and 
consumer bills have languished. His proposals to publicly finance congressional 
campaigns have earned him renown as an advocate but have not led to any reform 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, such efforts have contributed to Beilenson's reputation as an 
independent-minded lawmaker willing to take politically unpalatable positions 
that are certain to wind up in election opponents' brochures. 
</P>
<P>
Beilenson did win passage last year of a long-sought measure prohibiting the 
import of ivory and other pachyderm parts as part of international efforts to 
save the threatened African elephant. Under the measure, Congress can earmark 
as much as $5 million a year for elephant conservation projects; $300,000 was 
appropriated last year. Beilenson plans to ask for $5 million again in the 1990 
fiscal year, an aide said, but funding remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly, a two-term Republican, has yet to make a legislative mark. None of 
the handful of bills he sponsored in his three years has passed. 
</P>
<P>
This year, he picked up additional bipartisan support for his measure to 
authorize the death penalty for killers of police, judges and other law 
enforcement officials. Similar bills had previously stalled in committees but 
Gallegly maintained his was more narrowly drawn. 
</P>
<P>
He also sponsored a bill to deny federal student financial aid to individuals 
convicted of desecrating the American flag. It remains in the House Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
</P>
<P>
"He concentrated more of his attention to constituent service and building 
relationships with other members and familiarizing himself with the process," 
John Frith, Gallegly's spokesman, said of the former Simi Valley mayor's first 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Frith said, Gallegly's staff is exploring a series of legislative 
initiatives that may be introduced next year. 
</P>
<P>
These include a resolution putting Congress on record as opposing any 
consideration of legalizing drugs and bills to ban the manufacture, sale and 
importation of drug paraphernalia; to shift American troops no longer needed in 
Europe to Immigration and Naturalization border patrols and to give the 
President a line-item budget veto but allow Congress to override a presidential 
veto with a majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
Moorhead, dean of the California Republican delegation, has introduced a 
measure to require customs agents to check the vehicle identification number of 
exported automobiles. He said this would cut down on car thefts that involve 
changing identification numbers and shipping stolen vehicles overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Another Moorhead measure would permit the INS to use volunteers for clerical 
and secretarial duties at border patrol offices. This idea, which Moorhead said 
was prompted by volunteer programs in Los Angeles law-enforcement agencies, is 
intended to alleviate a manpower shortage by putting more professional agents 
out on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Neither bill has gained any apparent legislative momentum. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his design patents proposal, Moorhead also has introduced a bill 
to provide a process for patenting products developed through space 
exploration. He said he is optimistic about its prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond his own bills, Moorhead said, he is often involved in shaping 
legislation as the ranking Republican on Energy and Commerce's subcommittee on 
energy and power and on Judiciary's subcommittee on courts, civil liberties and 
administration of justice. The latter assignment has led to his pre-eminent 
legislative specialty. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of his legislative work has been done on patent and copyright -- useful 
but scarcely fascinating matters like protecting American patent rights abroad, 
protecting the privacy of electronic mail and extending drug patents to give 
time for regulatory approval," according to "The American Almanac of Politics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONGRESSIONAL BILLS PENDING 
</P>
<P>
Some legislation introduced in the 101st Congress by Valley Area 
Representatives: 
</P>
<P>
REP. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON (D-Tarzana) 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN FINANCING: Bill would publicly and fully finance all general election 
campaigns in the House of Representatives. Prospects: Measure failed to move in 
two previous sessions; partial public campaign financing considered a 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
GASOLINE TAX: Bill would phase in a 50 cents-a-gallon increase in the federal 
gasoline tax over five years, raising $150 billion for deficit reduction during 
that time. Prospects: Dim, given President Bush's pledge not to increase taxes. 
</P>
<P>
REP. HOWARD L. BERMAN (D-Panorama City) 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION REFORM: Bill would increase visas for family members of permanent 
U.S. residents and for workers. Prospects: Under active consideration; likely 
to be merged with other immigration measures. 
</P>
<P>
VIDEOCASSETTE COPYRIGHTS: Bill would ban the manufacture and sale of "black 
boxes" that facilitate the unauthorized copying of videocassettes. Prospects: 
Berman seeking hearing early next year in House Judiciary subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
REP. ELTON GALLEGLY (R-Simi Valley) 
</P>
<P>
DEATH PENALTY: Bill would empower federal courts to impose the death penalty 
for killing federal law enforcement officers. Prospects: Bottled up in House 
Judiciary Committee last session; Senate Judiciary Committee passed broader 
capital punishment bill in October. 
</P>
<P>
REP. CARLOS J. MOORHEAD (R-Glendale) 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN PATENT: Bill would expand copyright protection for industrial designs of 
such items as telephones, luggage and automotive parts. Prospects: Moorhead has 
unsuccessfully introduced measure in two previous 
</P>
<P>
sessions but has new-found congressional and Administration support. 
</P>
<P>
AUTO THEFT: Bill would require customs officers to verify identification 
numbers of vehicles before the cars are exported to make sure they are not 
stolen. Prospects: Uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
REP. HENRY A. WAXMAN (D-Los Angeles) 
</P>
<P>
CLEAN AIR: Sweeping bill would revise clean air legislation including urban and 
rural air pollution guidelines, toxic pollutants restrictions and acid rain 
controls. Prospects: Passage of a bill likely but high-stakes battles, 
particularly including over on alternative automobile fuels and acid rain 
provisions, remain. 
</P>
<P>
FOOD LABELING: Bill would require food labels to specify the amount of fat, 
cholesterol, sodium, protein and calories and manufacturers to provide 
scientific evidence to support health claims. Prospects: Waxman optimistic, but 
disagreements remain. 
</P>
<P>
PESTICIDE RESIDUE: Bill would change the standard for measuring acceptable 
level of pesticide residue on foods from a balancing of health and economic 
concerns to strictly health considerations. Prospects: Major fight looms, with 
Bush Administration proposing a bill more sympathetic to agriculture and 
chemical industries.

REMODEL: NEW AGUA DULCE FIREHOUSE BEGAN LIFE AS FAMILY HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters assigned to Los Angeles County Fire Station 81 in remote Agua 
Dulce find they can do most of their work from home. 
</P>
<P>
The home, in this case, is the station itself -- a converted three-bedroom, 
ranch-style house on Sierra Highway that serves a 60-square-mile area with a 
population of about 4,500. It houses two firefighters, a Fire Department 
engineer and a captain, each of whom spends an average of two 24-hour shifts 
per week in the cozy quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The 2,200-square-foot house was bought by the county in 1986 to replace the 
community's aging fire station in nearby Mint Canyon, Fire Department officials 
said. It is one of only three such stations operated by the county -- the 
others are on Catalina Island and in the city of Walnut, said Randy Gomez, 
construction coordinator for the Fire Department. Two other county fire 
stations operate out of mobile homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The house cost the county $250,000 -- about a third of what it might have cost 
to build a new station, officials said. The Fire Department spent an additional 
$50,000 to remodel the house. 
</P>
<P>
It's a nice change from the standard red-brick station, providing relaxation 
amid otherwise stressful working conditions, firefighters say. 
</P>
<P>
"On a comfort scale of one to 10, this is a 10," said fire engineer Allyn 
Holton, who regularly works at a much busier county fire station in Newhall but 
occasionally fills in at Station 81 when its engineer has to be away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more like a motel, instead of an army barracks." 
</P>
<P>
Fire Department planners built an office for the captain and installed a larger 
entrance, a microphone and loudspeakers for radio dispatches and a paper towel 
dispenser in the bathroom. But in most respects, the single-story house looks 
pretty much the way it did in its domestic state, said Capt. Ted Lindaman, one 
of three captains assigned to the station. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters enjoy the luxury of two fireplaces, a bathtub and a large kitchen 
with wood-grain cabinets and a built-in microwave oven. They pitched in for a 
large-screen television in the living room, and each bedroom has weightlifting 
equipment for fitness training. An outdoor satellite dish that came with the 
house improves TV reception in the mountainous area, Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
There isn't much interior decorating to speak of -- the walls are generally 
bare except for a large map showing county fire station locations -- and family 
mementos have been replaced by a firefighter's first-place award for a local 
chili cook-off and a wood plaque that says "The Fighting 81st." 
</P>
<P>
The captain and engineer have their own bedrooms, and the two firefighters 
share the third bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 12 Fire Department employees are assigned to the station, though 
only four occupy the house at any one time due to shift changes, Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
The house caught the eye of Fire Department planners because its garage had 
been built to fit the previous owner's motor home and was large enough for a 
fire engine, Lindaman said. Also, a large, corrugated-metal storage shed has 
room for four reserve engines that can be put into service throughout the area 
if regular engines are being repaired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the station's calls are for auto accidents on Sierra Highway -- an 
alternate route to the often congested Antelope Valley Freeway -- and 
occasional brush fires. In between, firefighters inspect water tanks for leaks 
and make sure that brush has been cleared near homes and businesses, Lindaman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The station handled about 400 calls this year, compared with about 3,000 at 
Station 73 in Newhall, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The homey atmosphere is nice for some, but others prefer a faster pace, 
Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a nice station to be at," he said. "But if you're looking for a lot of 
action, you want to get out of here. This is not what you would call a fast 
firehouse." 
</P>
<P>
And despite the remodeling, some of the fixtures just aren't designed for the 
kind of wear and tear that fire stations have to endure, Lindaman said. At most 
stations, doors are designed to swing so firefighters can quickly exit to 
respond to emergencies, but the solid wood doors at Station 81 sometimes lock 
when closed, creating hassles when firefighters rush out of the house toward 
the fire engine, Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has its advantages and disadvantages," he said. "This tends to alleviate 
some of the stress because of the atmosphere. But it's not really set up to be 
a firehouse. The fixtures are meant for a regular family. They're not meant for 
12 guys, day in and day out, going in and out." 
</P>
<P>
"You have firefighters who are dirty and grimy coming back from fires -- and 
the carpet has a tendency to get dirty." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the station are surprised to find out it's a house, Lindaman said. 
</P>
<P>
"People that stop in say 'Boy, this is pretty nice -- just like being at home,' 
" he said. "Well, it is, in a way. People have never seen a fire station like 
it."

RIVERSIDE TEEN-AGERS HELD AFTER 125-MILE CHASE IN STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A 14-year-old Riverside boy was arrested early Sunday after leading police on a 
125-mile, high-speed chase in a stolen car before finally running out of gas 
north of the Santa Clarita Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The youth's 16-year-old girlfriend, a passenger, also was taken into custody 
following the chase, which began about 1:45 a.m. in Riverside, said Sgt. Mark 
Lunn of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Riverside police attempted to stop the 1987 blue Mazda 323 after spotting the 
stolen vehicle at Washington Street and Overlook Parkway, Lunn said. But the 
car sped away, heading north on Washington Street, Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The pursuit continued to the westbound Riverside Freeway, where the California 
Highway Patrol took over the chase, which proceeded north on the Santa Ana 
Freeway at speeds of up to 110 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The chase continued through the San Fernando Valley and into the Santa Clarita 
Valley, where the couple left the freeway and headed west on Templin Highway, 
then north on The Old Road before running out of gas about 3 a.m., Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The two were arrested on suspicion of grand theft auto, possessing stolen 
property, evading arrest, being a minor in possession of alcohol and for not 
wearing seat belts, Lunn said. The boy also was arrested on suspicion of being 
an unlicensed driver, Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy told authorities that he stole the car before picking up his girlfriend 
at her Riverside home to go for a ride, Lunn said. 
</P>
<P>
The youths, whose names were withheld because of their ages, are being held at 
Sylmar Juvenile Hall, he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PACOIMA WOMAN SAVED FROM EMPTY CESSPOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacoima woman was rescued by Los Angeles firefighters Sunday after she fell 
20 feet into an empty cesspool, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Esquivel, 26, fell into the cesspool in the 8500 block of North Cayuga 
Avenue about 12:45 p.m., said Pat Marek, spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire 
Department. The underground catch basin near Esquivel's home had been opened by 
Los Angeles city workers for repairs, Marek said. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear how the accident occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Esquivel suffered minor injuries and was taken to Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills, where she was treated and released, a hospital spokeswoman said.

NFC PLAYOFFS: L.A. OFFENSE SCORES ON FIRST TWO POSSESSIONS AND ALL-ZONE DEFENSE 
SHUTS DOWN CUNNINGHAM AND EAGLES.

PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one ever said Buddy Ryan's team couldn't talk. Like coach, like team. The 
Philadelphia Eagles passed out opinions last week like business cards. 
</P>
<P>
Zone defense? If the Rams were sissies enough to try it, fine -- it's their 
reputations on the line down at the rifle club. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' defensive line? Couldn't be stopped. They'd swat the Rams from 
their path like moths from a doorstep. Super Bowl, here we come. 
</P>
<P>
Travel plans? If needed, the Eagles would be sunning in Santa Rosa this week in 
preparation for next week's divisional playoff game against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"They can go ahead and plan that flight to Frisco," Ram quarterback Jim Everett 
said, "but they ain't going." 
</P>
<P>
Not representing the league, anyway. The Rams ruined some great pregame 
material for round two with a 21-7 wild-card victory over the Eagles at 
Veterans Stadium on Sunday, earning a spot in next week's divisional game 
against the New York Giants in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
Not much to talk about, really. The Rams scored two touchdowns in the first 
eight minutes, could have scored two more in the next eight but didn't, then 
held on in typical hair-raising fashion, needing two Greg Bell bursts in the 
final five minutes to clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
Over Ryan's protestations about the sins of zone defense, the Rams proceeded 
with their coverage of Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham. He was to them a 
blip on their radar screen, never to be lost from tracking. 
</P>
<P>
Unsporting as it seemed, the Rams played not a single down of man-to-man 
defense against the Eagles. Theirs was more a quarantine approach of patience 
and containment, and it worked well enough to hold Cunningham to 39 rushing 
yards and no touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said last week that any quarterback worth his salt could undress a zone. 
Sunday, he could only tip his cap to Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur, 
who had caged Cunningham with nets, not bullets. 
</P>
<P>
On this subject, you might say Shurmur and Ryan, another defensive strategist, 
have differing opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree like hell with it," Shurmur said of Ryan's attack philosophy. 
"Physical is not described in terms of man-to-man or pass rush. Our guys are as 
tough as any group I've been around. These guys have been criticized, 
chastised; people have said what's a defense that's 21st in the league doing in 
the playoffs, all of those things. I think this was a great opportunity for 
them to show the world that, hey, we can play this game however you want to 
play it." 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side of scrimmage, the Rams' offensive line kept the heat off 
Everett. The Eagles' sack team of Reggie White and Jerome Brown bagged Everett 
one time each, but it wasn't the menacing rush of doom that had been predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle Jackie Slater said the line has never been better prepared, and worked 
in uncommon unison to pick up stunts and blitzes. 
</P>
<P>
The line held the Eagles in check -- without holding any Eagles. The lone Ram 
penalty in the game, in fact, was a self-induced delay call to proffer a better 
end-zone angle for punter Dale Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson considered his line's work commendable, given the task 
at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"Their line is very famous," he said mockingly of the Eagles' front four. "But 
they clearly had their hands full with our offensive line. You might call it a 
standoff." 
</P>
<P>
You might call it that; Robinson wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
"You get to vote," he said. "But I thought we won. They said they were going to 
win the battle. I don't think they did." 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles' arrogance, born of their coach, rubbed many Rams the wrong way. 
Even the team's most guarded diplomat, Everett, admitted he took some of last 
week's Eagle chatter into the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell said he was taunted throughout the game by Eagles' safety Andre 
Waters, who jarred the ball from Bell's arms on a first-down carry at the 
Eagles' five in the first quarter, a crucial fumble considering the Rams could 
have moved ahead, 21-0, with a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"He just talked the whole game," Bell said of Waters. "It got to be kind of 
funny. He kept saying 'Four-two (Bell's number), I'm going to get you.' And he 
got me." 
</P>
<P>
Bell redeemed himself later, with the Rams clinging to a seven-point lead in 
the fourth quarter. Pinned at their own 16 with 5:44 left, the Rams craved a 
possession drive to work time off the clock. They kept the drive alive on third 
and four at their 21 on a 15-yard pass from Everett to Buford McGee. On second 
down from the 36, Bell took a handoff and broke the play outside. 
</P>
<P>
Bell: "Sometimes they spend too much time thinking about what to say, and they 
don't think about what their assignments are." 
</P>
<P>
Bell broke free down the left sideline and ran 54 yards before being dragged 
down by Izel Jenkins at the 10. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I was flying down the field as fast as Bo Jackson would," Bell 
said, "but I was getting down the field. I knew he was back there, because I'd 
seen him when I took off. He wasted a lot of time trying to strip me (of the 
ball), rather than trip me up." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins did strip the ball, but Bell was able grab the ball with his other hand 
before going down. 
</P>
<P>
Bell ran three yards on first down and then scored the game-clincher from seven 
yards out with 2:14 left, putting the Rams up, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't top last week's 210-yard performance against New England, but this 
wasn't the Patriots' defense, either. Bell finished with 124 yards in 27 
carries, which was plenty good enough for Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
"Greg Bell had an outstanding game," Robinson said. "That was a slippery, wet, 
treacherous set of circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Bell said the Eagles, a gambling defense by nature, gambled one time too many 
on his long run. He said it was only a matter of time before a big play popped. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew our line was more dominant than theirs because they were trying so many 
stunts," he said. "If a team stunts a lot, it tells you one thing: they can't 
beat you straight, so they've got to try and finesse their way. And they 
weren't capable of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
So, Ram fans live to suffer another day. The Rams dominated the Eagles 
throughout, but still needed a fourth-quarter surge to protect the win. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was almost indignant when asked how such a thing could happen. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way this team has played all year," he said. "We screw up. That's 
us." 
</P>
<P>
It took the Rams five plays to score on their first possession, Everett 
throwing a wobbly, underthrown pass to receiver Henry Ellard, who was rewarded 
for jumping higher than safety Jenkins by pulling down the reception at about 
the 20 and strolling in for a 39-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
After a 30-yard Eagles' punt on their first possession, the Rams marched 46 
yards in seven plays for another touchdown, the score coming on a four-yard 
pass from Everett to Damone Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams might have been cruising at halftime if not for Bell's fumble inside 
the five; a 47-yard field goal attempt by Mike Lansford that went awry, and an 
Everett interception late in the half after the Rams had earned first-and-10 at 
the Eagles' 25. 
</P>
<P>
The unenlightened might see the squandering of such opportunities as wasteful, 
or nerve-wracking. 
</P>
<P>
"We have character," tackle Irv Pankey said. "We don't put up a facade of 
character, you see what I'm saying? We've got character." 
</P>
<P>
With Sunday's win, the Rams also have a chance, and a funny feeling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's growing on us," Everett said. "It's like the Rams can get there." 
</P>
<P>
And the Eagles can't. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
In the quarterback battle, Jim Everett completed 18 of 33 passes for 281 yards 
and two touchdowns; Randall Cunningham was 24 of 40 for 238 yards with no 
touchdowns and one interception. . . . Ram quarterback coach Dick Coury said he 
has had preliminary conversations about coaching vacancies with the Phoenix 
Cardinals and New York Jets. Coury said new Jet General Manager Dick Steinberg 
called him, but no formal interviews have been scheduled. . . . Ram defensive 
coordinator Fritz Shurmur is expected to be among those considered for the 
Cardinals' job. . . . Both sacks of Cunningham were made by linebacker Kevin 
Greene. . . . Add Cunningham: His only punt of the game traveled just 20 yards. 
. . . The Eagles' lone touchdown game on a one-yard run by Anthony Toney in the 
fourth quarter, capping an 11-play, 80-yard drive. . . . The Rams held the 
Eagles to just 95 yards net rushing.

RAMS GOT DEFENSIVE ABOUT IT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The poor guy was just trying to do his job, revving up a grounds-crew truck 
outside the Ram locker room, and there was John Robinson's red face, screaming 
at him. 
</P>
<P>
"Either move it in or move it out," Robinson yelled at the driver. "We can't 
get anything done with that going." 
</P>
<P>
Upon command, the rumbling truck shifted into reverse and retreated around the 
corner, out of earshot, giving Robinson the space he needed to conduct his 
postgame rap session. 
</P>
<P>
The coach looked pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, puffing out his chest. "We're tough guys." 
</P>
<P>
If you thought the Rams were defensive during Sunday's 21-7 wild-card victory 
over Philadelphia, you should have heard them in the aftermath. Under Ram horns 
sits some extremely thin skin, along with ears that burned all week, on both 
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
This is what the Rams heard, or what they thought they heard: 
</P>
<P>
(a) They're too soft. 
</P>
<P>
(b) They can't play in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
(c) They can't play in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
(d) They can't play a lick of defense. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson swears he heard it. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always on us -- we don't play enough man-to-man, we don't rush the 
passer, we're stupid, we don't know how to coach," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Jim Everett swears he heard it. 
</P>
<P>
"How many shows did I watch in Philadelphia talking about the Eagles going to 
San Francisco?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene swears he heard it. 
</P>
<P>
"We read stuff about the warm weather, the beach boys from L.A.," he said. "And 
I don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Basically, it took three Philadelphia quotes to set the Rams off. The first had 
Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan calling the Ram defense the worst in the playoffs. True, 
but unkind. The second also came from Ryan, claiming the Eagles were good 
enough to beat the 49ers, which presumed the Eagles already had the Rams 
beaten. 
</P>
<P>
The third came from Mike Schad, the Ram washout who now starts for 
Philadelphia. Schad forecast an Eagle victory because the Rams weren't physical 
enough up front and, basically, were about to get head-butted all over Veterans 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard all of it," Everett said. "We took a lot of pregame abuse. That comes 
with the territory, I guess, when you play Philly and Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us a lot of motivation. We had the locker-room material. They gave 
it to us. That's the way they play, that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
"They deserved everything they got today." 
</P>
<P>
So Sunday was a day for the Rams to break a few myths, although, as with most 
stereotypes, some of them were grounded in fact. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Before Sunday, the Rams were 2-5 in playoff games this decade. Robinson's 
only postseason victories had come against the Dallas Cowboys -- in 1983 and 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: Before Sunday, the Rams were winless in cold-weather playoff sites this 
decade, losing twice at Washington and again at Chicago in the 1985 NFC 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Fact: The Rams' defense did rank 21st in the NFL this season -- a dead-last 
28th against the pass. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Ram cornerback LeRoy Irvin a fact-checker. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the standings, look at the ratings," Irvin said. "We do have the worst 
defense in the playoffs. No doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
And the worst defense in the playoffs holds Randall Cunningham to seven points. 
</P>
<P>
"Not bad for a bunch of hacks," Irvin noted. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin wasn't, however, as ready to support the cold-war theory. 
</P>
<P>
"They said we couldn't win in the cold? Why?" Irvin said. "Because we lost to 
Chicago when they were the most dominant team in the entire league? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how they can say that. I'm from Kansas, Mel Owens is from 
Michigan, Vince Newsome is from Washington. We've got guys who've played in 
cold weather their entire college careers." 
</P>
<P>
Including running back Greg Bell, late of Notre Dame and the Buffalo Bills, who 
gets downright indignant over the topic. 
</P>
<P>
"People are always writing we have trouble with the cold weather," Bell said. 
"That's nothing new. I've been written off for the last six years. I've been 
out of the league for six years. I'm still reading that I'm a malingerer, 
although I don't see it and John Robinson doesn't see it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't see us blinking in the cold weather today. But that won't change what 
people write about us." 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing the Rams moved as well as they did in the Pennsylvania rain, 
considering the persecution complex they carried with them. 
</P>
<P>
But, whatever gets you through the wild-card round. If Rams had to believe that 
the world was out to get them in order to band together against the Eagles, 
then fine, there may be a future in paranoid power after all. 
</P>
<P>
If Everett found the going a little too slippery when wet -- he was intercepted 
twice -- the Ram defense and offensive line performed at peak capacity. When 
Philadelphia had the football, the Rams yielded but three first downs in the 
first half, sacked Cunningham twice and held the Eagles scoreless through three 
quarters. When the Rams had the ball, the hard-rushing Philadelphia front was 
neutralized, resulting in 409 net Ram yards, sleet or no sleet. 
</P>
<P>
"We physically controlled the football game," said Robinson, delighting in each 
syllable. "Their defensive line is to be congratulated; they're famous. I don't 
want to call it a standoff, but we controlled the line of scrimmage. Their 
defensive line clearly had their hands full." 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Everett gleefully pointed out, "We might live close to Hollywood, but we 
still know how to play football." 
</P>

STEELERS GIVE OILERS THE BOOT IN OVERTIME 
</P>

<BYLINE>

HOUSTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It began as a comedy of errors, and although both teams played 15 minutes of 
pretty good football in the fourth quarter, it ended with another big error in 
overtime -- a fumble that led the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 26-23 upset victory 
over the Houston Oilers Sunday at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Houston halfback Lorenzo White fumbled a kickoff in the end 
zone before picking the ball up and running it out to the five-yard line. This 
is a mistake that few high school backs make. 
</P>
<P>
In overtime, on the Oilers' first play after the Steelers had won the toss but 
failed to make a first down, White fumbled again. 
</P>
<P>
This time, Pittsburgh got it on the Oiler 46, made one first down, then called 
in Gary Anderson to kick the seventh 50-yard field goal of his career for the 
winning points of the day's second NFL wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
It was his fourth field goal of a ragged, sometimes badly played game that was 
full of dropped passes, mishandled punts, false starts and wasted big plays. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's kicking, however, was errorless, putting the Steelers in Denver for 
next weekend's second-round match with the favored Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
"It can go unsaid that our football team is on the way up," Pittsburgh Coach 
Chuck Noll said afterward. "Playoff time is fun time. That's what you work for 
all year." 
</P>
<P>
Houston Coach Jerry Glanville, who usually has a lot to say, said: "There 
really isn't much to say." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's big kick put Glanville's team away despite a strong comeback 
performance by Oiler quarterback Warren Moon, who took charge in the fourth 
period after Pittsburgh had led after the first 15 minutes, 7-0, at halftime, 
10-6, and after one series of the fourth period, 16-9. 
</P>
<P>
At that point -- after the Oilers had made only one first down in the third 
quarter -- Moon finally got them moving with two impressive drives ending in 
touchdown passes to wide receiver Ernest Givins. 
</P>
<P>
And now, after slumbering most of the afternoon, Houston was ahead, 23-16. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't last. As a crowd of Houston partisans swept the Steelers with noisy 
jeers, they marched 82 yards to get even in regulation time, 23-23, before 
winning it in the fifth minute of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh quarterback Bubby Brister was the triggerman for the Steelers on the 
two touchdown drives they managed in the midst of Anderson's kicking exhibition 
-- an exhibition in which he improved steadily as the day wore on with field 
goals of 25, 30, 48 and 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Brister's poise -- in only his second season as a starter -- was 
eventually the difference. But it was the coaching of Noll that made everything 
possible for the Steelers, who moved to their first touchdown with 
well-rehearsed, old-fashioned plays -- a Statue of Liberty run and a 
quick-pitch end run, both by rookie running back Tim Worley. 
</P>
<P>
In the opening minutes, after the Steelers blocked Houston's first punt at the 
Oiler 32, Noll's first call was the statue, which produced 13 yards. His last 
call was the pitch to Worley for the nine-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the NFL's better teams often relied on the quick pitch, which 
requires a big, fast back with the moves to cut around the defensive line 
without any help from pulling blockers. 
</P>
<P>
Noll, who has been around awhile, brought it back at the right time and place, 
and Worley made it go as well as Bobby Mitchell used to for Cleveland when 
Browns' opponents were keying on Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
The game-tying Pittsburgh touchdown drive in the fourth quarter was another 
Noll masterpiece. At all times, he made sure to keep the pressure off Brister, 
who was asked to throw nothing longer than 10 yards, and who was assisted at a 
timely moment by an end-around run by wide receiver Dwight Stone gaining 22 
yards to the Houston 29. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the Steelers hammered in the tying touchdown on six runs by their 
big backs, Worley and Merril Hoge, through a Houston line that had been 
devastated by injuries. By then, three of the Oilers' most useful defensive 
linemen, Ray Childress, Doug Smith and Richard Byrd, were all out. 
</P>
<P>
Noll's most successful call on that last drive, the one that probably won him 
the game, was Hoge's nine-yard draw play to the one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
And so a sharp, old NFL coach, Noll, combined with some sharp new Steelers -- 
Brister, Worley, Hoge and tight end Mike Mularkey, among others, to end another 
dream for Houston Coach Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
To most of the 58,306 watching in the oldest of the domed stadiums, Glanville 
appeared to have brought in the better offensive players -- Moon, Givins, wide 
receiver Drew Hill and four rotating backs, the best of whom is halfback Allen 
Pinkett. 
</P>
<P>
But as an offensive team, the problem with the Oilers is that their running 
offense is based on power and their pass offense on the run-and-shoot. 
</P>
<P>
You can usually tell what they're going to do by the way they line up. When 
their four little receivers are on the field, it's hard for them to fake a pass 
and succeed with a power run. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, they don't effectively pass after faking a run. 
</P>
<P>
Good football teams normally run to set up the pass -- as Washington and even 
San Francisco often do -- or they pass to set up the run, as Detroit does in 
its run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oilers don't do either. And in the overtime period, after their 
defensive team had stopped Pittsburgh at the outset, Glanville had to make a 
decision: Should he send in the pass-offense race horses or the power backs? 
</P>
<P>
After thinking it over a moment, he called for the power. But on first down, he 
gave the ball to White, an East-West runner with some moves who often fails to 
cut forward at the appropriate time. 
</P>
<P>
On the biggest play of the game, he was still sliding laterally when cornerback 
Rod Woodson came up and separated him from the ball. 
</P>
<P>
When White fumbled, the New Year's party was almost over for the Oilers. On 
Pittsburgh's first play after recovering the fumble, Noll went back to his 
trap-blocking offense -- he is one of the few favoring this style of attack as 
an everyday staple -- and got 11 yards from Hoge. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough for Anderson.

Boulder, Colo., schoolteachers Bill and Cheryl Dennler say they have learned 
their lesson. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 4, Bill Dennler watched elated fans topple the goal post at Folsom 
Field in Boulder after Colorado beat Nebraska, in effect assuring the Buffaloes 
of a trip to the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Dennlers took out a second mortgage on their home to finance sales of 
slices of the goal post, mounted on a wooden base with the CU logo, for $59.95. 
They obtained the goal post from the university, which is to receive 10% of any 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
But there apparently won't be any. 
</P>
<P>
The Dennlers' family room is stacked with about 400 plaques. "We've only sold 
about 50 of them," Cheryl Dennler said. "We've learned a lot about marketing. 
We've learned that we're not salespeople. We'll never do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Rookie Tony Mandarich of the Green Bay Packers, the first 
offensive lineman taken in the NFL draft, did not start a game this season. Who 
was the last offensive lineman to be chosen first and not start a game during 
his rookie season? 
</P>
<P>
Part of a tradition: Carmen Cozza, Yale's football coach, recalled being an 
assistant at Miami of Ohio in 1963 when head coach John Pont left for Yale. 
Cozza was beaten out for the Miami job by another assistant, Bo Schembechler, 
who will coach his final game for Michigan today. Cozza, a Cleveland native, 
took over at Yale when Pont became coach at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Any regrets after 25 years at Yale? Cozza told Joe Concannon of the Boston 
Globe: "I came from a country school to a school surrounded by a city. It was a 
different experience. I didn't realize the beauty of this place until I started 
walking through the courtyards, and I realized football as we know it today 
really started here. I've never wanted to leave." 
</P>
<P>
Grass is greener: Alan Page, Hall of Fame defensive end for the Minnesota 
Vikings and Chicago Bears, on playing on artificial turf: "I suppose you could 
say it was novel, at the beginning. But at the time, I was playing on good 
fields and ice fields and fields with no grass on them. This was another 
variation for the list. But it was at the bottom of the list." 
</P>
<P>
A sore winner: Lee Remmel, the Green Bay Packers' publicity director, on being 
a reporter during Coach Vince Lombardi's era: "When he was winning, (Lombardi) 
was very arrogant answering questions. When he lost, he had a certain amount of 
humility and was easy to talk to. But then Vince never had a losing season." 
</P>
<P>
Living the concept: Former Raider linebacker Matt Millen has a chance for a 
third Super Bowl ring, this time as a San Francisco 49er. Millen on his former 
team: "When you would watch them the last few years, you'd look at No. 55 and 
say, 'That's what a Raider is.' Am I wrong or right? I epitomized it."

AFTER YEARS OF WINNING, HATFIELD WORRIED ABOUT THE WORDING; 
</P>
<P>
COTTON BOWL: ARKANSAS COACH FUSSING OVER CONTRACT BEFORE FACING TENNESSEE IN 
SECOND CONSECUTIVE TRIP TO DALLAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In six seasons as head football coach at the University of Arkansas, his alma 
mater, Ken Hatfield has compiled a record of 55-16-1, the best winning 
percentage (.771) of any coach in school history. What's more, he has survived 
the '80s without the taint of NCAA probation, which, given the state of the 
Southwest Conference during the last decade, is practically a Man Bites Dog 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz, Hatfield's predecessor at Arkansas, took the Razorbacks to six 
different bowl games during his seven years at the school, but never got them 
to the Cotton Bowl. Today, under Hatfield, the 10th-ranked Razorbacks (10-1) 
will make their second consecutive Cotton Bowl appearance, meeting 
eighth-ranked Tennessee (10-1). The game marks the first time Arkansas has 
appeared in back-to-back Cotton Bowls since 1965-66. 
</P>
<P>
But, even with these accomplishments, Hatfield doesn't rest easy, and a new 
contract, offered to him a year ago, remains on his desk in Fayetteville, Ark., 
unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a couple of little wording things in there that I don't think are 
right," he said, "and I'm not going to sign it as long as they're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . It's a difference of opinion. At this point, we have not resolved it. 
But I love Arkansas. It's my state. We've won there. We're recruiting well 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But will they love him tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
When Hatfield replaced Holtz, ousted after a 6-5 season, the move was hailed as 
a native son returning to his roots. Hatfield, coming off a five-year run as 
head coach at Air Force, had grown up in Helena, Ark., and played defensive 
back for the Razorbacks. His 81-yard punt return for a touchdown helped 
Arkansas beat Texas, 14-13, in 1964, the year the Razorbacks went 11-0 and won 
the national championship. Razorback fans, weary of Holtz's jokes and excuses, 
were ready for the change. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long, however, before the school's fickle following turned on 
Hatfield. His offense, a wishbone derivative known as the flexbone, was roundly 
knocked for being unimaginative and boring. Hatfield's personal style also drew 
criticism. He was said to be too preachy, too open with his religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-Hatfield sentiment reached a crescendo in 1987 when the Razorbacks, 
picked to win the SWC, finished tied for second. And as that season wound down, 
Arkansas Athletic Director Frank Broyles, the man who had coached Hatfield and 
then hired him 19 years later, joined the chorus, saying publicly that Hatfield 
needed to open up personally -- be more willing to explain his actions to 
Arkansas fans -- and open up his offense as well. 
</P>
<P>
Under these pressurized conditions, the Razorbacks won the '88 SWC championship 
outright and earned the school's first Cotton Bowl trip in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of that season, Hatfield was offered a new contract, but he declined 
to sign it. There was speculation before Arkansas' Cotton Bowl meeting with 
UCLA that Hatfield was headed for Georgia to replace the retiring Vince Dooley. 
Hatfield did not dispel that speculation, then later said the talk linking him 
to the job was enough of a distraction to contribute to his team's 17-3 loss to 
the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "As a reward for a great ('88) season, he got a new five-year 
contract, a big raise and raises for his coaches. I did that way before the 
Cotton Bowl. Then he looks at it, and he wants a big . . . Well, his lawyer 
wants a big definitive contract rather than just what faculty and Holtz and 
(former Arkansas basketball Coach Eddie) Sutton and Broyles and others had. So 
we write up a big definitive contract for him." 
</P>
<P>
Definitive? "Meaning everything a lawyer can think of," Broyles said. "Thirteen 
pages." 
</P>
<P>
Broyles says he is "totally confident" with Hatfield in charge of the football 
program, although they are not close personally. 
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "We have nothing in common off the field, because he does certain 
things like . . . Well, I play golf. He plays tennis and other things. When I'm 
not at the office or at home, I'm playing golf. But I don't think I would want 
to be personal friends with the people who work under me, as a rule. I just 
don't think that's wise. But Ken and I are professional friends." 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield on Broyles: "My relationship with him is something that's been 
different ever since I've been back at the University of Arkansas. But, hey, 
he's doing a good job. As an athletic director, he's doing a tremendous job." 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's plain that these two are on different pages philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
According to Broyles, a college football coach nowadays has to do more than 
simply win. He must win with the sort of flair that will keep the stadium full 
and the contributions flowing. 
</P>
<P>
Said Broyles: "The day Lou Holtz walked in, I said, 'You've got to sell out the 
stadium, do whatever it takes to sell out the stadium.' And he did. He knew 
that. I think any coach knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield may know it, but he doesn't buy into it. He did dump his flexbone this 
season in favor of the I-formation. But Hatfield remains a ground-oriented 
coach. The Razorbacks actually threw the ball less in '89 than they did in '88. 
</P>
<P>
Hatfield on offense: "Too many of the commentators doing football on television 
are pro-oriented or come from the pro ranks. They think you've got to throw the 
ball every down. . . . The game is changing a little bit, but the media people 
have made it like if you don't pass, you're no good. A fullback who carries the 
ball is not thought of as highly as a receiver who makes a splashy, spectacular 
catch. And yet I love that fullback who's got a momma and daddy just like 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
So, what does Ken Hatfield want? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know yet," he said. "I mean, I know what I want, but that's something 
that the administration, myself and so forth are going to have to talk about 
after Jan. 1."

NEBRASKA'S GDOWSKI IMPRESSES THE PEOPLE WHO COUNT THE MOST; 
</P>
<P>
FIESTA BOWL: CORNHUSKER QUARTERBACK, THE COACHES' CHOICE, LEADS TEAM AGAINST 
FLORIDA STATE.

<P>
Unlike Florida State's Peter Tom Willis, his lankier counterpart in today's 
Fiesta Bowl game, Nebraska quarterback Gerry Gdowski probably won't attract 
much attention from NFL scouts. 
</P>
<P>
A year from now, the 6-foot, 190-pound Academic All-American might well be back 
home in Fremont, Neb., balancing books as an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
Like Willis, though, Gdowski will look back fondly on a senior season in which 
he was nothing short of spectacular in his only chance to be a collegiate 
starter, putting up the kind of numbers that made fans and the media wonder 
where he had been hiding for three years. 
</P>
<P>
According to his coach, Tom Osborne, no Nebraska quarterback has ever played 
the position any better than Gdowski. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, he remains almost as unknown as he was last August. 
</P>
<P>
An understudy for two years behind All-Big Eight quarterback Steve Taylor, a 
three-year starter for the Cornhuskers, Gdowski emerged from Taylor's shadow 
only to be eclipsed this season by Colorado's spectacular Darian Hagan, who led 
the Buffaloes to the Big Eight championship, an unbeaten regular season, an 
Orange Bowl date against Notre Dame and the top of the polls. 
</P>
<P>
But when it came time for the Big Eight coaches to select an all-conference 
quarterback, the name they chose was Gerry Gdowski. 
</P>
<P>
The media chose Hagan. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the coaches found these numbers hard to ignore: 
</P>
<P>
 -- While Hagan passed for 1,002 yards and ran for 1,004 to become only the 
fifth player in major college history to both pass and run for more than 1,000 
yards in the same season, Gdowski passed for 1,326 and ran for 925 in 69 fewer 
attempts than Hagan, averaging 7.9 yards a carry to Hagan's 5.4. 
</P>
<P>
"When you figure that he's going to run some quarterback sneaks and he's going 
to get sacked a few times, it's really remarkable for a quarterback to average 
(almost) eight yards a carry," Osborne said. "I'd say that's probably the most 
significant of his statistics." 
</P>
<P>
It is not, however, the only one that stands out. 
</P>
<P>
Some others: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gdowski averaged 204.6 total yards a game, which was superior to Hagan's 
average of 182.4 and established a Cornhusker record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- While Hagan accounted for 21 touchdowns, including 17 by rushing, Gdowski 
accounted for 32 total and 19 through the air, one every seven pass attempts 
and only one short of Vince Ferragamo's school record. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gdowski threw only two interceptions in 136 pass attempts, none in his last 
92, and accumulated a passing efficiency rating of 177.3, which would have 
surpassed Jim McMahon's NCAA record of 176.9 if Gdowski had attempted the 
required 15 passes a game instead of only 12.4. 
</P>
<P>
"Amazing," Kansas Coach Glen Mason said of the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Still, outside his football-crazed home state and the projection rooms of 
Cornhusker opponents, Gdowski is widely unrecognized. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the reason for that, it seems, is that despite a 10-1 record and No. 6 
national ranking, the Cornhuskers were under-publicized this season, especially 
for a team that earned its 21st straight bowl bid. 
</P>
<P>
None of Nebraska's powder-puff nonconference schedule, which included games 
against Northern Illinois, Utah, Minnesota and Oregon State, was televised by 
the networks or ESPN. Neither were the Cornhuskers' Big Eight games against 
Oklahoma and Oklahoma State because those teams, sanctioned by the NCAA, 
couldn't appear on television this season. 
</P>
<P>
And Nebraska hardly made the most of its only national TV appearance, losing to 
Colorado in a showdown for the Big Eight title. 
</P>
<P>
But even that doesn't explain Gdowski's lack of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
While Hagan passed for only 22 yards and ran for 86 and a touchdown, accounting 
for 108 total yards in Colorado's 27-21 victory over the Cornhuskers, Gdowski 
ran for 69 yards in 14 fewer carries and passed for 211 yards and three 
touchdowns, accounting for 280 total yards against a defense that allowed only 
300 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
It's understandable, then, that when asked what he hoped to get out of today's 
game, Gdowski said: "I guess maybe a little respect." 
</P>
<P>
Though he averaged 8.2 yards a carry in 35 rushing attempts as a sophomore and 
junior, Gdowski gave little indication of his passing prowess, throwing for 
only 72 yards in two seasons after connecting on only 32.6% of his attempts 
three years ago as a starter on the freshman team. 
</P>
<P>
"I had probably a better year than I could have imagined," said Gdowski, who 
would have a year of eligibility remaining if he had redshirted as a sophomore 
instead of spending the season third on the depth chart. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, even Gdowski didn't anticipate his emergence. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be the third-team quarterback and I was going to have a chance 
to play a little bit and travel with the team," he said of his decision not to 
redshirt. "Plus, I knew I could graduate in four years. I thought it would be 
better just to get on with things. 
</P>
<P>
"If I could have looked into the future and known I was going to have a year 
like this, I would have liked to redshirt. But I'm happy with the way things 
turned out. I don't regret anything."

No. 9 Auburn, which finished the regular season with a five-game winning 
streak, faces No. 21 Ohio State, which won six of seven games after a 2-2 
start, today for the first time since 1917 in the Hall of Fame Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers (9-2) are eight-point favorites over the Buckeyes (8-3), but Auburn 
Coach Pat Dye is wary of the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an underdog has been a motivating factor for them every day for a 
month," said Dye. 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes, playing in a bowl game for the first time in three years, led the 
Big Ten in offense and scoring, utilizing the kind of balanced attack that gave 
Auburn problems in a midseason loss to Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State Coach John Cooper is concerned about Auburn's defense, which held 
opponents to 268.7 yards and 10.6 points and will counter the Buckeyes' size 
(Ohio State's offensive line averages 295 pounds) with quickness. 
</P>
<P>
"People have been telling us how hard it's going to be moving the ball against 
Auburn, and you can see that on the films," said Ohio State quarterback Greg 
Frey, whose improved play was instrumental in the Buckeyes' turnaround from a 
4-6-1 finish in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't really tell until you get out there, though," Frey said. "I don't go 
into a game worrying about whether we're going to run the ball or throw it. All 
I want to do is win. We'll just do what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
The Buckeyes would prefer to run, allowing Carlos Snow and Scottie Graham to 
pound away at the defense and control the clock. Snow rushed for 948 yards 
despite a nagging knee problem and Graham gained 924 yards, but Frey has been 
effective enough throwing that opponents can't take the passing game for 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
The junior quarterback led the Big Ten in passing efficiency and finished with 
128 completions in 215 attempts for 1,900 yards and 12 touchdowns.

There have been times this season when Ohio State's best defense has been its 
offense. The Buckeyes gave up 386.7 yards and 24.2 points, but overcame it by 
averaging 418.1 yards and 29.5 points on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State's 28-18 loss to Michigan in the last game stopped a six-game winning 
streak, but the Buckeyes weren't any hotter than Auburn down the stretch. The 
Tigers looked average in building a 4-2 record but gained momentum in the weeks 
leading up to a 30-20 victory over Alabama on Dec. 2.

Scott Geyer's 85-yard interception return helped Arizona close out the decade 
with a 17-10 victory over North Carolina State Sunday night in the inaugural 
Copper Bowl, college football's newest postseason game. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams dominated on defense and North Carolina State (7-5) held Arizona 
(8-4) to only 50 rushing yards and just 130 total yards, the worst in both 
categories for the Wildcats this season. The Wolfpack gained 222 yards passing 
and 88 rushing and had the ball almost 16 minutes longer than Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
But the Wildcat defense recovered two fumbles, made two interceptions and 
survived three fourth-quarter drives by the Wolfpack that could have tied the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of only 37,237 watched the game, about 20,000 under capacity at Arizona 
Stadium, the Wildcats' home field. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona led, 17-7, at halftime on a 37-yard pass from Ronald Veal to Olatide 
Ogunfiditimi, Geyer's second interception of the game for the touchdown and 
Gary Coston's 34-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Montgomery threw a four-yard pass to Todd Varn with 1:55 left in the half 
for North Carolina State's only touchdown. The Wolfpack also scored on Damon 
Hartman's 43-yard field-goal with 4:53 left in the third quarter, ending a 
10-play, 62-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats forced turnovers that cut off three Wolfpack drives and came up 
with the key plays when needed. Chris Singleton forced a punt with a 13-yard 
sack and Ty Parten prevented Aubrey Shaw from converting a fourth-and-one at 
the Arizona 26 with 3:03 to go. 
</P>
<P>
After Arizona punted, the Wolfpack's last chance ended when Chris Williams 
dropped a pass from Montgomery deep in Arizona territory with 57 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays after a Wolfpack punt, Veal passed to Ogunfiditimi to start the 
scoring with 1:59 left in the first quarter. It was only the third touchdown 
pass of the season for Veal. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the second period, with the Wolfpack at Arizona's 17 and driving 
after Jesse Campbell intercepted a Veal pass at the Wildcat 29, Geyer stepped 
in front of a pass by Montgomery intended for Varn and easily raced 85 yards to 
make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Montgomery's short pass to Varn brought North Carolina State within a 
touchdown, but Arizona drove from its 36 to the Wolfpack 24 after the ensuing 
kickoff and Coston kicked his field goal 10 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona's worst previous rushing total this season was 97 yards against Texas 
Tech and the Wildcats had only 161 yards against Oregon. They lost both games.

Ed Chynoweth, the president of the Western Hockey League, stepped in and 
persuaded members of the Tri-Cities Americans that they should play their 
scheduled game against the Portland Winter Hawks at Portland Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
The night before, the Americans and Winter Hawks were scheduled to play in in 
Kennewick, Wash., but that game was canceled after 20 members of the Americans 
refused to play. 
</P>
<P>
The revolt was aimed at Bill LaForge, the team's new director of hockey 
operations. The players want him fired. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the players said Saturday that they disliked LaForge's approach 
and would not play until he is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Chynoweth said a compromise was reached Sunday. He didn't say what it was, but 
added: "What I pointed out to them, very simply, was that if they weren't 
prepared to play, then I had no choice but to look at possible suspensions and 
the possible loss of scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that's a threat. I think that's a fact of life." 
</P>
<P>
LaForge, hired Dec. 17, has taken on the duties of co-coach with Rick Kozuback, 
who has been head coach since the hockey season began. The Americans began the 
season as a favorite to win the WHL's Western Division but have fallen into 
third place at 16-16-3.

TWO BIG WINS GIVE JETS CONFIDENCE

The Winnipeg Jets enter the new year with a lot of confidence after victories 
over two of their Smythe Division rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smail scored the winning goal at 9:32 of the third period Sunday at 
Winnipeg as the Jets followed an 2-1 overtime victory over the Calgary Flames 
two nights earlier with a 3-2 win over the Edmonton Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big win for us in Calgary and it would have been a shame to come back 
here and lose to another team that we're chasing," said defenseman Dave Ellett, 
who scored in the second period. "It was a big confidence builder." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hawerchuk also scored for the Jets, who won their third straight to climb 
to within three points of the third-place Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton was outshot, 31-27, and showed the effects of having to play two games 
in less than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers beat Montreal, 6-2, just 18 hours earlier in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, New York Rangers 4 -- Mario Lemieux and Mark Recchi scored 20 
seconds apart late in the third period at Madison Square Garden to extend the 
Rangers' winless streak to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux tied the game at 14:10 with a 10-foot wrist shot past Bob Froese. 
Recchi tapped in Dan Quinn's pass at 14:30, extending the Rangers' winless 
skein to 0-8-3, their longest since 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins capitalized on a Ranger mistake for the tying goal. New York 
failed to place a man in the penalty box when Kris King received a major for 
slashing at 8:42. The Rangers were unable to get a stoppage of play after the 
penalty expired and were still a skater short when Lemieux scored. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 4, Buffalo 2 -- Pat LaFontaine scored three times, extending 
his goal-scoring streak to seven games, to lead the Islanders at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
LaFontaine, who took over the league lead with 33 goals, has 12 goals in his 
last seven games, during which the Islanders are 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, New Jersey 4 -- Rick Zombo, Marc Habscheid and Lee Norwood had goals 
during a 2:19 span as the Red Wings scored five times in the third period at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit, which was 1-19-2 when trailing after two periods, scored four goals 
within a 7 1/2-minute span early in the third period to overcome a pair of 
two-goal deficits and snap a four-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, St. Louis 1 -- Dave Gagner stole the puck from Rob Brind'Amour and 
beat goaltender Vincent Riendeau 1:14 into overtime at Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars, who were 2-11-2 in December, snapped winless streaks of six 
games overall and five at home. Since it had the NHL's best record (15-8-1) on 
Nov. 24, Minnesota is 3-12-2. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull of the Blues sent the game into overtime with 8:21 left in 
regulation with his 33rd goal. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 2, Vancouver 2 -- The tie at Vancouver gave the Flyers sole 
possession of first place in the Patrick Division, one point ahead of New 
Jersey and Washington.

RULE CHANGE MAY HAVE OFFICIALS USING ERASER ON RECORD BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An obscure but potentially significant ruling has recently been enacted that 
may change the face, and certainly the record books, of American road racing. 
</P>
<P>
At the recent convention of The Athletics Congress, which governs track and 
field and road racing, a rule was passed which makes times run in 
point-to-point races ineligible for record consideration. The rule also 
modified the allowance made for downhill portions of races. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, times run on point-to-point courses would be considered "records," 
but only for that type of course, and would have little meaning. Times set on 
courses falling outside the new guidelines will now be labeled "noteworthy 
performances." Further, the rules will be applied retroactively to all existing 
distance racing records. 
</P>
<P>
Remember that last part. But first, a bit of background. 
</P>
<P>
There are basically three kinds of course configurations for distance races: 
</P>
<P>
Point-to-point -- Runners start at point A and finish at point B. 
</P>
<P>
Loop -- Runners start at point A and go in a loop to finish back at point A. 
</P>
<P>
Out-and-back -- Runners start at point A, go to a halfway point, and return on 
the same course to finish back at point A. 
</P>
<P>
There has long been discussion in the running community on which course is best 
and most fair. Each has its merit, but the out-and-back course is considered 
most fair. A point-to-point course may be designed so that runners may never 
face a prevailing head wind, for example. A loop course may be designed to 
skirt a horrible hill. On an out-and-back course the runner experiences the 
best and worst of every factor. The tail wind on the first leg will be in his 
face coming back. The downhill on which he could coast on the way out turns 
into a grinding uphill on the way back. 
</P>
<P>
Course variations have also made it difficult to compare relative times. All of 
this has led to years of debate in the road racing community both domestically 
and abroad, culminating in the passage of the TAC rule. 
</P>
<P>
So what? So, consider that America's biggest marathons, Boston, New York and 
Chicago, are all point-to-point races. Also consider that Alberto Salazar's 
American marathon record for men was set at Boston. Joan Benoit Samuelson's 
record for women was set at Chicago (which may sneak in because of an rule 
change that liberalized the allowable distance from the start to the finish 
line). Also consider that Mark Nenow's 10K American record at Crescent City 
fails the start/finish test. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the rule does not apply to world records, the international impact 
is the same. Especially since Americans do compete internationally. The women's 
world record was set at London, a point-to-point course. The Seoul Olympic 
Marathon was point-to-point. The course for the 1994 Barcelona Olympic marathon 
is point-to-point and with elevation variations that may not make it eligible 
for record consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The impact this rule will have on American marathons is tremendous. According 
to records compiled by the Road Race Management newsletter, under this new rule 
the top 17 all-time performances for U.S. men are ineligible for record 
consideration. That appears to make the American record-holder at the marathon 
Tony Sandoval, with a 2:10:20 set Sept. 9, 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of changing start/finish lines after decades of tradition may have 
race directors in a snit. The Boston Marathon is actually the Hopkinton, Mass., 
to Boston Marathon. The New York City Marathon's entire cachet is the fact that 
the race starts on Staten Island and weaves through all five boroughs. 
Tradition and logistics are not the only issues. Television loves the New 
England-in-spring look of the early stages of the Boston race and the ethnic 
neighborhoods of the New York course. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the start/finish problem, Boston also fails the elevation 
requirement. Despite its well-known landmark, Heartbreak Hill, Boston is 
basically a downhill race. The new rule allows for an elevation decrease of 10 
feet per mile. Boston has a net decrease of 14 feet per mile. In fact, 
according to Basil Honikman of TAC, Boston's dramatic drop in elevation has the 
effect of making it 500 yards short. 
</P>
<P>
This may account for the fact that, up to the end of 1988, six of the 10 
fastest times ever run by an American were at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Marathon is well within the tolerance levels of the new rule. 
L.A. is and always has been a loop course. It is and shall remain a flat 
course. The elevation change for the race is one foot per mile, barely 
noticeable. The total change is 187 feet, as compared to Boston's drop of some 
450 feet. 
</P>
<P>
This rule change may serve to boost L.A.'s attraction to elite American 
runners, who may not want to waste a world-class effort on a course in which 
they can't get a record. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the rule will have a profound effect on the sport. However, not all 
change is bad. Times on the roads have long been properly called world bests, 
not world records, and for a reason. Unlike races on tracks, road race course 
have had little uniformity or even a modest adherence to worldwide standards. 
Only by factoring in such elements as elevation, wind and even the layout of a 
course can uniform standards begin to be applied to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
This difficult decision by TAC is merely the wave of the future and can only 
help lead to the eventual ratification of road race "records" as accepted world 
records. While internationally some racing officials are dragging their feet on 
adopting TAC's rule in their own federations, look for this idea to slowly gain 
worldwide acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Former marathoner Dick Beardsley, whose 2:08:54 is second all-time among U.S. 
men, is struggling to recover from an injury that mangled his leg and left him 
with a goal of walking again, much less running. 
</P>
<P>
Beardsley, who lives in rural Minnesota, suffered the injury in a farm accident 
Nov. 13. He was transferring corn to a crib on his farm near Shafer when his 
coveralls became caught in a tractor power takeoff, a drive shaft used to power 
farm implements. He suffered a broken right wrist, broken ribs, cuts on his 
calf muscles in his left leg and severe ligament damage to the left knee before 
he was able to turn off the machine. 
</P>
<P>
Although the accident was horrible, Beardsley had been working with a physical 
therapist three times a week at his farm and his recuperation from the surgery 
had been progressing well. 
</P>
<P>
Then disaster struck again. Last month Beardsley, 33, developed a severe 
postoperative infection in the site of the original surgery and was admitted to 
a hospital after developing a fever. Beardsley's agent, Bill Wenmark, said the 
infection had not invaded the knee joint or gotten into Beardsley's blood 
system, which was good news. 
</P>
<P>
The road ahead is long, however. The second surgery sets his rehabilitation 
back several months. It may take Beardsley years to get out from under the 
medical bills. He had no health insurance at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Running Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Marathon has added a 5K race, to start a half hour after the 
marathon runners. Like the marathoners, the 5K runners will finish in the 
Coliseum. The March 4 race will get substantially more television coverage than 
last year. KCOP Channel 13 has increased its total coverage to 8 1/2 hours, 
with a half-hour preview show the night before the race, five hours of race 
coverage and a three-hour highlight show. Last year's coverage was a total of 5 
1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Marathon's annual series of clinics begins Jan. 9. Race director 
Joe Carlson will outline the program for the weeks leading up to the race. The 
clinics are conducted in cooperation with the Long Beach Parks and Recreation 
Department and will be held at Recreation Park Community Center at 7:30 p.m. 
Information: (213) 494-2664. . . . The Redondo Beach Super Bowl Sunday 10K is 
going strong in its 12th year. The Jan. 28 race usually draws a large field, 
this year about 15,000 runners are expected. In addition to the 10K race, there 
is a companion 5K walk, which is in its second year.

People are lined up on the freeway, trying to get to work from San Diego's most 
popular new suburb -- Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
It's 7:15 a.m. In 45 minutes, you and thousands of others will have beaten the 
morning rush -- you hope -- only to sit at your desk for eight hours before 
returning to the San Diego/Tijuana/drive-time fray. 
</P>
<P>
The scenario is more likely than you might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands may work in "America's Finest City" but they won't be able to live 
here. Those who cannot afford California may look in desperation to Baja 
California, or points many miles east of here. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to San Diego in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The place where the population will continue to boom; where the Hispanic and 
Asian communities will gain increasing prominence; where the work force will 
undergo sweeping changes. It's the place with more traffic, more smog, and a 
vexing need to resolve such problems as what to do with the airport and how to 
build more jails. 
</P>
<P>
With a population expected to reach nearly 2.8 million in the year 2000, 
growing 16% from today's 2.4 million, San Diego County will continue its 
urbanization curve through the 1990s, demographers predict. 
</P>
<P>
Even more stunning growth is expected in the San Diego Unified School District. 
From 1986 to the turn of the century, the number of students is expected to 
increase 46% to 165,000. The largest increase is expected to be in the 
high-school population. 
</P>
<P>
But planners say those increasing numbers of people will be increasingly 
squeezed for places to live -- leading to higher prices, vanishing open space 
and the emergence of new suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Max Schetter, director for the Economic Research Bureau of the Greater San 
Diego Chamber of Commerce, said the county growth will produce surprising 
shifts and turns, not the least of which is the "Tijuana factor," in which not 
only do Mexicans continue to migrate to the United States to find jobs, but 
U.S. residents move in the other direction, with affordable housing in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The poor and lower-middle class might settle in Mexico only because the average 
price of a San Diego home may be prohibitive by the year 2000, outstripping 
gains in income. 
</P>
<P>
The average household income is expected to rise 90% during the decade, to 
$92,400. But the average home price is expected to rise by 124%, to $439,500. 
</P>
<P>
"The huge numbers of Hispanics and Asians coming into the county will work in 
San Diego but may live in Mexico," Schetter said. "As housing becomes less 
affordable, they'll have to consider Tijuana, or points considerably east of 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"People will want to work here but can't afford to live here. It could affect 
all ethnic groups of the lower middle class (including non-Hispanic whites)." 
</P>
<P>
As workers line up at the border, creating massive traffic jams in an effort to 
get to work, Schetter predicts, the county will need new border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
Schetter and other experts say that, 
</P>
<P>
except for the upper class, those who wish to move within the county -- "to 
trade up" -- will be severely limited in doing so. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will have massive equity in their homes, but it won't do them much 
good unless they move to another region, because all the other houses in San 
Diego County will have gone up just as much. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the demand for housing, during the 14 years from 1986 to 2000, 
the number of housing units is expected to increase by 37%, to more than 1 
million. Vacant land is expected to undergo a corresponding shrinkage of 
100,000 acres, a loss of about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Makeup 
</P>
<P>
Given the press that the increasing Hispanic population has received, it is not 
surprising to most San Diegans that continuing migration and high birth rates 
will mean that the number of Hispanics in the county will more than double, to 
700,000, from 1980 to the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
But what confounds even some demographers is that the Asian population will 
more than triple during that time, to 356,600. The change was not foreseen 
until recently. 
</P>
<P>
But Richard Madsen, a sociologist at UC San Diego and contributor to the book, 
"Habits of the Heart: Individualism and Commitment in American Life," said the 
Asian explosion makes perfect sense when considering its sources: Hong Kong, 
Indochina and other cities in California. 
</P>
<P>
Control of Hong Kong reverts from the British to the Chinese in 1997, so Madsen 
believes refugees will leave Hong Kong -- San Diego being only one destination 
-- over a gradual 7-year period. He believes the evacuation of Indochinese from 
Cambodia and Vietnam has by no means ceased. He sees greater numbers of 
Japanese and Koreans arriving in San Diego because of its promise of 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"You have as many as 50,000 people a year leaving Hong Kong now," he said. 
"Plus, the Hong Kong government recently turned away thousands of Indochinese 
refugees. They had to return to Vietnam. Sooner or later, some of those will 
come here." 
</P>
<P>
Madsen sees the West Coast as becoming "much more multiethnic in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"Every generation has had its share of immigrants, but clearly the most visible 
immigrants in this generation will be Asians and Hispanics. It presents certain 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"America has long been dominated by European values. The mentality has been 
WASPish or European, and that may change. Americans have tended to be more open 
than some societies, but on the other hand, this nasty streak of racism seems 
to be coming back. I thought racism had waned after the civil rights movement, 
but that isn't the case at all." 
</P>
<P>
The non-Hispanic white population -- in 1988, 67% of the county's residents -- 
is expected to fall to 58.5% by the year 2000. The county's black population is 
expected to stay about the same, at nearly 6%. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the San Diego Police Department nor the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department keep statistics on so-called hate crimes, except to say that they 
rose significantly in the 1980s. Madsen fears the county's clash of cultures 
may ignite more in the future. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, for instance, that the number of Asians entering the state's elite 
University of California system increased dramatically during the 1980s, with 
the trend expected to flex itself more strongly during the next decade. As 
minorities win out in academic and professional challenges, "it's not hard to 
see," he said, why tensions will be inflamed. 
</P>
<P>
Age 
</P>
<P>
The aging baby boomers will play a major role in making San Diego an older 
county in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the median age was 28.8 years; by the year 2000, it is projected to be 
35.8 -- just about middle age. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Tayman, senior planner with the San Diego Assn. of Governments (SANDAG), 
said that change will affect the make-up of families, putting older parents at 
home with their children. "The baby boomers are having kids a lot later," he 
said. "We'll have a lot more parents, 50 and 60 years old, with kids home. It's 
kind of terrifying when you think about it. We expect to see a tremendous 
increase in high school students in the Nineties." 
</P>
<P>
Madsen, the sociologist, said older parents may be a change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"Such parents will probably be more mature, more comfortable materially and 
thus better able to take care of children," he said. "I see it as a plus. They 
may feel more sympathetic to paying for education, as much as they do, say, for 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
But those older parents are expected to face double burdens -- caring for their 
own parents at the same time that they care for their children. 
</P>
<P>
As life expectancy increases, the number of double-generation elderly is 
expected to increase -- "younger" senior citizens in their 60s, for example, 
caring for parents who are in their 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see a significant increase in the elderly," Tayman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employment 
</P>
<P>
Tayman predicts dramatic changes in the county's work force. He said that more 
than half the new workers will be female, and more than 60% of new workers will 
be minorities. He said that only 15% of new workers will be white, non-Hispanic 
males. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing entry of women into the workplace, he foresees child 
care becoming perhaps the most major employment issue of the 1990s. In 
addition, the new ethnic makeup will make affirmative action a major issue of 
the new decade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to see a lot of discrimination suits." 
</P>
<P>
Those workers are expected to go to jobs increasingly centered in the high-tech 
arena and focused more and more away from the military. 
</P>
<P>
Recent studies of employment trends predict the number of direct military jobs 
staying the same in the county through the year 2000. But Schetter said those 
figures might have been outdated by a combination of glasnost and the federal 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a trend that's been growing for a long time," he said. "At the end of 
World War II, 70% of all county jobs were oriented to the military. Now, the 
figure is somewhere near 20%." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the number of military workers remains the same, it will be dwarfed by 
expected increases in other fields. For example, the number of retail service 
employees will increase from 1986 to the turn of the century from 141,069 to 
203,307. Manufacturing, which employed 127,893 people in 1986, is expected to 
provide jobs for 200,000 by the end of the new decade. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the county's work force is expected to increase during that time by 
50% and almost 500,000 jobs -- none of those in the armed services. 
</P>
<P>
And very little of that increase -- 139, to be exact -- is expected to fall in 
the agricultural category, a sign of increasing urbanization in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Schetter said the county is becoming more high-tech, more white-collar, more 
business-oriented and much less dependent on the military. 
</P>
<P>
No sleepy little Navy town any more; no rural backwater in the shadow of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transportation 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic increase in the number of workers also puts pressure on the county 
to find a way of getting those people to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the growth of the work force, the increase in traffic will be much 
greater than the growth of the population," Tayman said. 
</P>
<P>
Tayman said San Diego's "drive-alone" compulsion has to cease, or the rush-hour 
commute will be "horrendous," on the order, say, of Houston or Los Angeles. He 
said the current average of 1.1 San Diegans commuting to work each day by car 
must increase to 1.5 or 1.7 by the end of the decade to avoid disastrous 
traffic snarls. As a result, Tayman said car-pooling may evolve from the realm 
of "polite suggestion" to a legislative mandate born of necessity. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Tuomi, SANDAG's transportation expert, said San Diego County has 56% more 
traffic today than it did nine years ago. He said new freeways, extensions of 
old ones, an expanded trolley line and a commuter rail system through North 
County will ease the traffic burden, but the key is boosting the passenger load 
per car. 
</P>
<P>
Tuomi said that 55 million people ride the county's trolley or bus lines each 
year; the number "needs to reach" 95 million by 1995. In the 1990s, the 
trolley's eastern end, now in El Cajon, will stretch as far as Santee. It will 
move north, from downtown to Old Town and will soon service the new Convention 
Center as well. 
</P>
<P>
Tuomi said the No. 1 traffic hot spot of the 1990s is Interstate 5, 
specifically the junction of Interstates 5 and 805. 
</P>
<P>
"Interstate 5 carries more than 200,000 cars a day now," Tuomi said. "In 1980, 
the number was 100,000, so it's doubled in a decade. We're expecting 310,000 
cars a day on I-5 by the year 2000. That's definitely a source of concern. 
</P>
<P>
"Interstate 8 is our most heavily traveled freeway, handling about 270,000 cars 
a day. We expect to hold at that number until the year 2000. The traffic growth 
of East County is no longer as fast or fierce as up north. We expect the 
extension of California 52, which now goes from I-5 to Tierrasanta, to be 
extended to Santee and to ease the west-east burden dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
The other major transportation conflict of the 1990s will be the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Koerper, SANDAG's special projects director, said the question of what to 
do with Lindbergh Field will be resolved in the Nineties, one way or the other. 
If it isn't, if procrastination rules, then that in itself will be a decision, 
Koerper said: "Some people don't act until there's a crisis, so maybe we'll 
have one." 
</P>
<P>
The Navy objects to making Miramar Naval Air Station the site of a new regional 
air facility, although the air station comes up repeatedly among the panels 
charged with making a decision on a new location. The Navy says the air station 
is not now and never will be available to civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
Koerper sees potential crises as an air crash in the downtown area, traffic so 
ugly on Harbor Drive that "you'll have to arrive two hours early to catch your 
flight." 
</P>
<P>
"Or we might have our air-carrier service curtailed because of use restrictions 
on the runway," he said. "Lindbergh might be taxed with one big convention 
after another coming in to use the Convention Center. We'll find we don't have 
the airport to accommodate the Convention Center, and then we'll do something." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Prognosis 
</P>
<P>
Tayman and others say San Diego "will be more big-city in the years to come," 
taking on the good, and the bad, that come with high-level urban living. 
</P>
<P>
We may see a downtown sports arena, and a professional basketball or hockey 
team to play in it; we should see at least one more Super Bowl (probably in 
'93); at least one baseball All-Star Game (for sure in '92) and maybe another 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Tayman and others think planning is sophisticated enough here to prevent San 
Diego from becoming a crude clone of its northern neighbor, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Ironically," said Schetter of the Chamber of Commerce, "our organization was 
formed in 1870, and the issues they were talking about then -- housing, 
transportation, water, commerce, jobs, crimes . . . are the same ones we're 
talking about now. We seem to have done pretty well between then and now. I see 
no reason why we can't move forward with hope." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On a Growth Curve: PROFILE OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
An older and higher-income population of San Diegans will crowd into more 
expensive houses in the year 2000, planners predict. The county expect to add 
about 400,000 new residents in the 1990s. While much public attention has been 
given to the projected rise in Hispanic population, it is the Asian population 
that will have the largest relative growth.

VALLEY CENTER'S HOMELESS PUT BLAME ON BUILDING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Madge May put most of her savings into a nice piece of property in Valley 
Center and planned to build a little house for herself and her 6-year-old 
daughter in the pretty little town. 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, she still waits for a chance to build her dream home, unable 
to obtain a building permit because of a 9-year-old building moratorium in the 
valley and unable to sell the land to anyone else. She and her daughter have 
been living in a white frame garage on the property, "roughing it" without 
proper toilets or electricity and hoping that inspectors look the other way. 
</P>
<P>
Her washer and dryer sit unused and unplugged in a corner while she goes to the 
coin laundry each week. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there was a building moratorium, but I thought the sewer was going in," 
May said about buying the 3-acre parcel. "My friend (Bob Winsett) sold it to me 
for a modest price. He had bought it in 1978, and the taxes were eating him 
up." 
</P>
<P>
May had good reason to believe that Valley Center was going to get a sewer 
system when she bought her land. The Valley Center Municipal Water District had 
been working on sewer plans for the central part of the valley since 1975. The 
county Board of Supervisors in 1980 imposed a building moratorium because the 
valley's septic systems posed a health hazard. The moratorium brought a federal 
grant for the $13-million sewer project -- and construction of the sewer 
project would have meant the end of the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
But, over the years, the population around the valley had changed from farmers, 
dairymen and ranchers to retirees, young families and others seeking to escape 
from the urban hubbub. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to the valley northeast of Escondido moved there for much the same 
reasons that Madge May did: to get away from noise and traffic and smog. The 
thought of a "country town" with tract housing and traffic signals and shopping 
malls that a sewer system would allow welded the valley's residents into an 
slow-growth, anti-sewer coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after May bought her property, the slow-growth coalition campaigned for 
and won the right to have a deciding vote on any project by the local water 
district costing more than $1 million. The sewer project was dead and the 
federal grant withdrawn. Only the decade-old moratorium remained. 
</P>
<P>
Although she has plenty of space for a septic system, May cannot put one in 
because of the moratorium, which was placed on 3,200 acres of the central 
valley area after the rainy years of 1978 and 1979. During the late 1970s and 
early '80s, ground-water levels in the valley rose nearly to the surface and 
septic systems contaminated the runoff. Eleven septic systems failed. 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Madge May has attempted to "talk sense" to county 
officials and win an exemption from the building moratorium. After all, the 
rainy years are long past and the ground water has receded so low that it would 
take a 40-day deluge to bring them back up to contamination levels, she argues. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was "a political move" to give the local water district the 
"emergency situation" it needed to win a federal grant for a sewer system, she 
said. Now, in the driest year in the past century, why can't the county Board 
of Supervisors allow one financially strapped woman to build one small septic 
system? 
</P>
<P>
Runoff from May's septic system would raise the Valley Center ground-water 
level by only 0.4 of an inch in 1,000 years, engineers tell her. 
</P>
<P>
"And the irony of it is that I could plant my 3 acres in citrus and put 
3-million gallons of irrigation water into the ground every year and do it 
legally," May said. "It just doesn't make sense. But, no matter what you say, 
no matter how rational you are, they just won't listen." 
</P>
<P>
May is not alone. A lot of property owners are in the same fix -- unable to do 
a thing with their property. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Benson owned industrially zoned property in the moratorium area and 
complains that "the only thing I could do was pay taxes on it and graze horses 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Lloyd, a Valley Center businessman, said merchants in town "are being held 
hostage by the moratorium." How can the town grow and businesses thrive when a 
person can't even add a bedroom, he asks. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sharp has owned property in the moratorium area for more than a dozen 
years and planned to build his retirement home there. He isn't getting any 
younger, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Val Wynn, a civil engineer with offices in Valley Center, pointed out that the 
moratorium has forced development out of the logical "town center" onto the 
edge of town. The school district had to build its new schools out on the 
fringe of Valley Center. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening, businessmen and town folk agree, is that Valley Center is 
growing around the edges, leaving the moratorium area bare, like a hole in the 
middle of a doughnut. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Waltz, assistant chief of county environmental health services, 
sympathizes with people caught in moratorium, especially with Madge May. 
</P>
<P>
"I admire her greatly," Waltz said of May. "She has tremendous perseverance." 
</P>
<P>
But Waltz takes issue with those who say the building ban is no longer needed 
in these dry years. Despite the lack of rainfall for the past three winters, 
Waltz said, there are still septic tank failures in Valley Center and the 
ground-water level has not retreated all that much. 
</P>
<P>
County supervisors echoed her opinion earlier this month when they refused to 
lift the Valley Center building moratorium. Perhaps because of the plight of 
May and the dozens of other property owners caught in the building ban, 
slow-growth forces and building advocates are slowly edging toward a 
compromise: sewers in a rural community. 
</P>
<P>
Marty Tisdale, chairman of the Valley Center Planning Group, reports that "the 
key players in extremely diverse factions" are coming together to revise the 
community plan, lowering the high-density zoning that was imposed in 
anticipation of a sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Knust, who represents the pro-sewer forces, says "both sides do not agree 
wholeheartedly on anything," but acknowledges that "they are talking for the 
very first time." 
</P>
<P>
Madge May is in the center of the peace negotiations, coming home from work for 
a quick meal with her daughter in their rustic shed, then rushing off to a 
subcommittee meeting, which often lasts well into the night. 
</P>
<P>
She resents the time it is taking and admits that daughter Amy views the latest 
shift in the growth vs. no-growth battle as "just another thing that takes me 
away from home for three or four hours at a time." 
</P>
<P>
May doesn't know if the compromise talks will earn her the right to build her 
house, and she's getting mighty tired of the fight and the pioneer existence 
she and her daughter are forced to live. 
</P>
<P>
"But then I think, what else can I do?" she said. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPORTS IN THE '80S; 
</P>
<P>
THE GOOD, BAD AND UGLY OF THE DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A quick look at some of the highlights (and lowlights) of San Diego sports in 
the 1980s: 
</P>
<P>
1980 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Coleman spends one year as Padre manager before returning to the 
broadcast booth after a last-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield leaves the Padres and signs as a free agent with the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Stadium is renamed San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium after the late 
sports columnist. The Chargers win their second consecutive AFC West 
championship but lose to Oakland, 34-27, in the AFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young trails, 45-24, with 3:56 to play, but rallies to beat SMU, 46-45, 
in the Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
1981 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn finishes his San Diego State basketball career as the all-time 
leader in assists and steals. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Sterling buys the Clippers from Irv Levin, plasters his picture all over 
town and promises to make everyone proud of his team. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers lose John Jefferson and Fred Dean after protracted contract 
squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
After one year with nice-guy Frank Howard as manager, the Padres hire grumpy 
Dick Williams. The Chargers win their third consecutive AFC West championship. 
</P>
<P>
1982 
</P>
<P>
The Padres trade Ozzie Smith for Garry Templeton. 
</P>

<P>
Some things they said during the 1980s: 
</P>
<P>
Claude Gilbert, answering a booster's criticism about the red-and-white 
uniforms worn by San Diego State's football team in 1980: "I designed those 
uniforms. I've been catching hell here for eight years, and I'll keep catching 
hell. But you know something? I don't care. We're going to keep those uniforms 
until you get yourselves a new football coach." 
</P>
<P>
The red-and-white uniforms were gone in 1981. So was Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
Don Coryell, on the SDSU administration's firing of Gilbert: "They've got their 
heads so far underground they can't see." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Donald Sterling's promises were hollow. 
</P>
<P>
Take this one from 1981: "One day, it will be harder to get a Clipper ticket 
than it will be to get a Charger ticket." 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
An irate Rich Gossage struck out at Padre owner Joan Kroc in the aftermath of 
the clubhouse beer ban in 1986: "She's poisoning the world with her 
hamburgers." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Garvey, on the reaction of his new wife, Candace, to his revelation that 
he might have fathered two babies out of wedlock: " . . . Her greatest line to 
me was, 'Well, at least I got you off the streets.' " 
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, commenting on Brigham Young University before the 1981 Holiday 
Bowl: "I don't have a lot of fond memories of school. In fact, I hate school. 
Once I graduate and get to the NFL, I won't be coming back here." 
</P>
<P>
Jim McMahon, responding to a reporter's questions in 1989 by blowing his nose 
at him: "There's an answer for you." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Fouts could be surly in postgame interview situations, particularly after a 
game such as the 34-27 loss to Oakland in the 1981 American Football Conference 
championship game. A microphone thrust through a crowd of reporters veritably 
brushed his beard. 
</P>
<P>
"Get this damn thing out of my mouth," he snarled. 
</P>
<P>
He looked up. The offending reporter was his father, Bob, a broadcaster in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Charger defensive back Pete Shaw, lamenting the 1981 trade that sent wide 
receiver John Jefferson to the Green Bay Packers after a long contract 
squabble: "A lot of players are angry about this. We feel a deep loss, like a 
death." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Fay, the owner of New Zealand, complaining that Dennis Conner and his 
catamaran, Stars &amp; Stripes, had "dogged it" in winning the 1988 America's 
Cup races off Point Loma: "I don't think that other boat was raced at all out 
there today. It was disappointing to see a competitor ahead of us parked . . . 
We would rather have been beaten by a greater margin than see a competitor sail 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Former San Diego State basketball Coach David Gaines: "You know what you call a 
guy who finishes last in a class of 25 at medical school? You call him doctor. 
You know what you call a coach who finishes last? You call him fired." 
</P>
<P>
Gaines was fired after SDSU tied for last in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
A classified advertisement from 1980, when Ozzie Smith and his representative 
were trying to squeeze a better contract out of the Padres: "Padres baseball 
player wants part-time employment to supplement income. College education. 
Willing to work. Prefer PR-type employment. Needs hours tailored to baseball 
schedule but would quit baseball for right opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Kroc offered him a job as a gardener. 
</P>
<P>
He is doing quite well these days with the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Winfield, after leaving the Padres and signing a 10-year contract worth 
$15 million with the New York Yankees following the 1980 season: "Hey, I'm 
ready, I paid my dues, I need some attention. I feel good about my supporting 
cast." 
</P>
<P>
The "supporting cast" won 103 games in 1980 without him.

FOOTNOTES: QUAKE PUT DAMPER ON WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all their pluck, Bay Area workers did not accomplish much in the weeks 
after October's massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Companies surveyed by William M. Mercer Meidinger Hansen, a benefits consulting 
firm, reported that employees were afraid to commute to their jobs and use 
office elevators, easily flew off the handle, had trouble concentrating on work 
and were falling asleep in meetings. "Very little work got done," most 
employers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
And that just covered the workers who showed up. "At least one employee took 
early retirement on the spot, rather than return to work," according to the 
Mercer study of 39 companies employing 120,000 Bay Area residents. 
</P>
<P>
While a majority of employers reported signs of emotional distress among their 
workers in the three weeks after the Oct. 17 quake, fewer than half had taken 
steps to improve workplace safety, upgrade disaster plans or provide employees 
information about earthquake preparedness, the study found. One company brought 
in a geologist to talk to workers; three arranged direct help for employees hit 
hard by quake damage. Only two firms did nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning to Move? Try Malta 
</P>
<P>
The weather may have been rotten, but the tiny Mediterranean island of Malta 
still hopes to capitalize on the worldwide publicity it received during the 
recent Bush-Gorbachev summit there. And California is the chief target. 
</P>
<P>
"People before were asking, 'Where is Malta?' " said Joseph Vella Bonnici, 
manager of investment promotion for the government's Malta Development Corp. 
"At least now they know where it is." 
</P>
<P>
To lure foreign investors, Malta offers a package of incentives similar to 
those provided by some other European countries, including such goodies as a 
10-year tax holiday and reduced tax rates for foreign managers. 
</P>
<P>
The government is most interested in attracting electronics firms, which could 
use Malta as a jumping-off point to market in Europe. So Bonnici said the 
development agency plans to open a promotion office in California sometime next 
year. By then, the image of President Bush trapped aboard a Navy ship for 10 
hours by high seas may be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Microwave, Mexican Style 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to microwaveable snack food, Mexican-style food is much more 
popular than ready-to-eat frozen hamburgers or packaged croissant sandwiches -- 
especially in California. A recent study by the Los Angeles office of Selling 
Areas Marketing Inc. finds that Americans spend 60 cents per capita on frozen 
burritos and only 30 cents per capita on frozen hamburgers. However, 
Californians spend two to three times the national average on frozen Mexican 
food products. 
</P>
<P>
Those reports did not go unnoticed at Four 'n Twenty, the Tustin-based 
subsidiary of an Australian company. It began to distribute a two-ounce, 
beef-filled pastry called "Aussie Snacks" in April and plans to add a 
taco-flavored pastry to its line. The product will be introduced in Los Angeles 
and San Francisco early this year, said Craig Lesly, general manager.

OCEANSIDE DRUGS, VIOLENCE BLAMED ON GANG INVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY TESSLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oceanside police say drug use and violence among the city's long-established 
ethnic gangs have been overshadowed by the arrival of Crips gang members from 
Los Angeles and elsewhere looking to set up a permanent cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working three or four shootings by these new gangsters in town," said 
Ruben Sandoval, a seven-year veteran of the police department's gang unit, 
which was increased from two to four officers to handle the Crips. 
</P>
<P>
According to Oceanside police reports, four incidents within a 10-day period in 
October reflected the violence that they believe has been brought by the 
newcomers: 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 21, a woman was shot in the leg when she tried to stop gang members 
from using her apartment to sell drugs. She told investigating officers "that 
L.A. Crips gang members had been using her apartment to sell cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 23, two women allege they were fired at by Crips after one of the 
women told a gang member her little brother would no longer sell drugs for 
them. A victim said in the police report that "L.A. Crips had recently moved 
into the Oceanside area and had taken up selling rock cocaine" from an 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 28, a woman told police that four Los Angeles Crips forced their way 
into her apartment after beating up a man outside in a drug dispute. She said 
gang members had been trying to use her apartment as a base for drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 31, two local men were shot and wounded by two suspects. A police 
report said one victim recounted that his assailant had claimed to be a member 
of a Los Angeles gang. The shooting occurred when one of the men warned the 
gang members to stop selling cocaine from his sister's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Such bloodshed has become commonplace in metropolitan areas like Los Angeles 
and San Diego. But drug-related violence by outsiders is new to the 130,000 
people of Oceanside, where gang fighting was largely confined to Hispanic and 
Samoan gangs arguing over their turf. 
</P>
<P>
Police say that about 15 to 20 Los Angeles-based Crips first came to Oceanside 
in the summer of 1988, selling cocaine from hotels and motels on the weekends, 
and returning to Los Angeles during the week. 
</P>
<P>
They dealt drugs for six months until some were arrested; beefed up police 
patrols pressed most of the others to leave, evidenced by a sharp decline in 
cocaine sales, say police. "We were saturating the streets with 50 to 70 
officers," said Oceanside police Chief Lee Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
A few months of peace followed, but last summer a new batch of Crips arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"There were more of them," said Sandoval, about 35 or 40, he estimated. Most 
came from Los Angeles, but police learned from driver's licenses and vehicle 
registration that others came from San Bernardino, Lancaster and Perris. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference is, they're going into certain residential areas and buying off 
the homeowners by giving them drugs or paying them," Sandoval said. The Crips 
live here, but resupply themselves with drugs from Los Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
An alarmed Drummond initiated a $20,000 study of the city's gang problem by law 
enforcement consultants, including Manuel Ortega, police chief in Bell-Cudahy, 
and Lt. Paul Jefferson of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The study, released last month, concluded that "gang-related crime in 
Oceanside, while still largely confined to traditional turf wars, (has) 
recently taken on a distinctly more dangerous and criminal nature" because of 
the arrival of "predatory gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside police believe their city has attracted the Crips because it is 
located between Los Angeles and San Diego and it represents a new market for 
rock and crack cocaine. "If gone unchecked, they could set up a lucrative 
market here," Drummond said. 
</P>
<P>
A 20-year-old Oceanside woman, who used to sell crack bought from Los Angeles 
Crips living in Oceanside, said there's opportunity here. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who come down here are small frys up there, but down here they're 
really big," said Leilani, who spoke on the condition that her street name and 
last name not be used. She said a quantity of cocaine that sells for $5 in Los 
Angeles gets $20 in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
She said Crips enlist "rushers" who stand outside a crack house to make quick 
transactions with buyers who drive or walk buy, and also hire drug users to 
deal cocaine for them downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"If their dope is good, each of five rushers can make $1,000 or more a day," 
Leilani said. Crips "like to have 13- and 14-year-olds selling for them because 
when they get into trouble, they're just going to juvenile hall, but they're 
not going to do no big time." 
</P>
<P>
Sandoval said police have arrested more than 100 users and dealers over the 
last three months and 10 search warrants have been issued to enter suspected 
drug houses. Scores of arrests have been made around the 200 block of North 
Hill Street, where Rick Trevino, Sandoval's partner for three years, said 
people working for the Crips were doing a brisk and highly visible business. 
"They were blatantly dealing," said Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
But downtown, cocaine street sales appear to have fallen over the last few 
weeks, and Sandoval believes the lull may be caused by the cold nights or the 
increased police enforcement.

rise in violence and drug sales on an influx of members of the Crips gang from 
Los Angeles and other areas. Police say gang members do a brisk business,

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPORTS IN THE '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOP PRO EXECUTIVE 
</P>
<P>
Jack McKeon, Padres: McKeon, hired as vice president/baseball operations in 
September 1980, turned the Padres' franchise from a laughingstock into a prized 
possession. And as the citizens of San Diego have learned, it's not wise to 
become emotionally attached to any player. McKeon has engineered trades 
involving 165 players since his arrival. Their 1990 spring-training roster 
consists of just four players -- Tony Gwynn, Eric Show, Garry Templeton and Ed 
Whitson -- who opened the 1987 season with them. They don't call him Trader 
Jack for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
TOP MALE PRO ATHLETE 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, Padres: It took just one minor league season for the Padres to be 
convinced that they had something special on their hands. Of course, when 
you've got a guy batting .331 in rookie league and .462 in double-A, it doesn't 
take a genius to figure he might have some major league talent. What 
materialized was four National League batting championships, five All-Star 
appearances and an image that would put Wally Cleaver to shame. Gwynn is the 
pride and joy of the Padres, and one day just might be standing behind a podium 
at Cooperstown, being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Others considered: Dan Fouts (Chargers). 
</P>
<P>
TOP FEMALE PRO ATHLETE 
</P>
<P>
Paula Newby-Fraser, triathlete: Since moving to Encinitas from England in 1985, 
Newby-Fraser has become a household name on the triathlon circuit. She has won 
three Ironman Triathlons and more than 40 other championships, including the 
two in San Diego this year, the Bud Light and San Diego International. For 
winning all of these titles, she has won more than $100,000. A native of 
Zimbabwe, South Africa, Newby-Fraser started her racing career in Europe in 
1985. She finished third in the Ironman Triathlon that year -- and then got 
serious. 
</P>
<P>
Others considered: Wendy MacPherson (bowling), Robin White (tennis). 
</P>
<P>
TOP PRO COACH 
</P>
<P>
Ron Newman, Sockers: He has had plenty of critics, including players who don't 
always see eye-to-eye with his sometimes unorthodox methods. But the Sockers 
have won seven championships this decade under him. Newman has always had a 
knack for molding players from all over the world, with vastly different 
backgrounds, into a unit that wins. They fight, but they win. Newman has also 
established himself as an innovator, coming up with new strategies each season 
to keep a step ahead of other coaches -- and even the referees. 
</P>
<P>
TOP PRO TEAM 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers: Who else? Seven championships. Each year, they have to think up a 
new slogan. We've seen: "Twice is not Enough." "Keep the Streak Alive." "One

players come in to boost them to a new title. Mainstays of the first group were 
Juli Veee, Jean Willrich and Kaz Deyna. Brian Quinn and Kevin Crow came along 
in 1983, Branko Segota and Steve Zungul in 1984. And goalies Zoltan Toth and 
Victor Nogueira have anchored championships the past two seasons. The biggest 
threat to the Sockers' dominance in the '80s wasn't any one particular team but 
the Major Indoor Soccer League, which nearly folded several times because of 
financial difficulties.

1984 Padres: The improbable Padres, never before taken seriously, rode their 
second winning season all the way to their first World Series. They captured 
the hearts of the city like no other sports team, and maybe that's what helped 
them reach the Series. Nobody wanted the fun to end. They finished the regular 
season 92-70 but opened the National League playoffs in Chicago by dropping two 
consecutive games. Facing a sweep, the Padres returned to San Diego after Game 
2 to find a few thousand fans waiting in the San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
parking lot. Recharged, the Padres became the first team in NL Championship 
Series play, and the second team in Championship Series history, to overcome an 
0-2 deficit and win a series. The fun finally ended, though, when the Padres 
were defeated by Detroit in the World Series, four games to one.

1981-82 NFL playoffs, Chargers vs. Dolphins: On the day after New Year's, 1982, 
Rolf Benirschke's 27-yard field goal at 13:52 of overtime finished a dramatic, 
41-38, Charger victory in the Orange Bowl in one of the great games in NFL 
history, one that both teams seemed to have won several times. Both Dan Fouts 
and Miami's Don Strock passed for more than 400 yards. The Chargers had and

Judy Sweet, UC San Diego athletic director: The UC San Diego athletic program 
flourished under Sweet, the first woman to become athletic director at a school 
that had a combined men's and women's program in 1975. But it wasn't until the 
'80s that the Tritons exploded on the NCAA Division III scene. UCSD teams won 
11 national titles in the '80s, finished second 14 times and third 12 times. 
During that span, UCSD had 300 All-Americans, 18 academic All-Americans and two 
NCAA post-graduate scholarship winners. While the Tritons were making their 
presence felt in Division III, Sweet was making an impact in the NCAA. She was 
vice president of Division III from 1986-88 and became the first women to be 
elected secretary-treasurer of the NCAA in 1989.

Although Asian consumers have a reputation for frugality in their homelands, 
where saving is encouraged, their Asian-American counterparts are avid shoppers 
-- generally less concerned about price and convenience than they are about 
quality, according to new research. 
</P>
<P>
The findings are bound to renew the debate among advertisers and marketers 
about how to best reach America's rich mix of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, 
Filipinos and Southeast Asian immigrants, as well as highly assimilated 
Asian-Americans. Although such consumers are widely viewed by Madison Avenue as 
a potentially lucrative market because of their comparatively high incomes and 
education levels, differences in language and culture make them difficult to 
reach, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"Most advertisers think that all they need to do is simply translate an English 
ad to reach this market," said David Chen, executive vice president of the Los 
Angeles advertising firm Muse Cordero Chen &amp; Baca. "But there are problems 
with that; there are many differences among Asian people. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand advertisers being concerned with the difficulty," Chen said, 
"but it's not a difficulty we cannot overcome. Themes like stressing quality 
have universal appeal" among many Asian groups. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the SRI/Gallup organization of Lincoln, Neb., found that in choosing 
a product, 67% of 779 Chinese-American consumers surveyed ranked the quality of 
the product more important than price, store location or service. Similarly, an 
SRI/Gallup survey last year of 400 Japanese and Korean households in Southern 
California found that while there were "significant" cultural differences 
between the two groups, both "are upscale shoppers with rapidly expanding 
purchasing power." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, both Impact Resources of Columbus, Ohio, and the Find/SVP 
research organization in New York found Asian-Americans to be avid shoppers who 
are generally more concerned about product quality than the general population. 
For instance, while price was more important to the total population than among 
the 3,251 Asian-Americans surveyed in the Impact study, 54% of the 
Asian-Americans said quality is the most important reason for selecting a men's 
clothing outlet, compared to 50% of the total population. 
</P>
<P>
Quality, of course, is a subjective concept, and it is still unclear to many 
experts why Asian-Americans embrace certain brands or whether they will remain 
loyal to them as they become more acculturated. Nevertheless, some marketing 
specialists believe that companies should continue to direct special campaigns 
at even highly assimilated third- and fourth-generation Asians, although 
convincing advertisers of that approach has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been banging on the door since 1985, and now we're beginning to see 
greater acceptance of the Asian market," said Greg Sullivan, president of Asian 
Television Sales, a San Francisco company that sells advertising time on three 
Asian-language television stations, including KSCI in Los Angeles. "What 
advertisers don't realize is that if you are an Asian immigrant, 80% of this 
stuff on TV you've never heard of." 
</P>
<P>
Concentrated in three areas -- California, Hawaii and the New York metropolitan 
area -- Asian-Americans represent a large and rapidly growing market. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian population has increased 67% since 1980 in Los Angeles County alone, 
according to a 1987 Census Bureau estimate. And because the mean family income 
of Asian-Americans is about $10,000 higher than that of Latinos, their buying 
power is substantially greater, said Holmes Stoner, head of Artesa Media 
Services, a Los Angeles ad agency that specializes in marketing to Latinos and 
Asians. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, unlike Latino immigrants who come from countries closer to the United 
States, Asians are not as familiar with the broad universe of American goods. 
As a result, many Asian-Americans flock to a dominant brand deemed "the best" 
by their immigrant neighbors, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
For example, studies conducted between 1986 and 1988 by SRI/Gallup found that 
40% of Chinese consumers surveyed used Tide laundry detergent, 44% of Koreans 
used Ajax cleaner and 70% of Japanese used either Crest or Colgate toothpaste. 
No other brand had more than a 10% share in each of those product categories. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many experts see a tremendous opportunity to instill brand loyalty 
and grab a large share of the Asian-American market by trumpeting the quality 
or the prestige of their product to newly arrived Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
In advertising to the general public, for example, Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Co. of New York runs ads featuring the comic strip character Snoopy saying, 
"Get Met; it pays." But in a special campaign directed at Chinese- and 
Korean-Americans, the company stresses its prestige, as well as Asian values 
such as financial security and family responsibility. Instead of showing 
Snoopy, the ads shows several massive office buildings owned by Metropolitan 
Life. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a more tangible identification of where our financial strength lies," 
said William Orton, a marketing executive with Metropolitan Life. "We did a 
fair amount of market research in terms of what major themes would appeal to 
the Asian community . . . We emphasize the prestige of dealing with a company 
that was here yesterday and will be here tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Las Vegas hotels such as the Desert Inn and Caesars Palace have held 
Chinese New Year parties, advertised on Asian-language TV and put on other 
glossy promotions stressing the quality and prestige of their hotel's 
accommodations to entice both Asian-American and foreign tourists. Caesars also 
has marketing offices throughout Asia -- as well as in heavily Chinese-American 
Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The Asian community is a significant market for Caesars Palace; we try to 
emphasize (to them) the elegance and ambience of our world-renowned resorts," 
said Jack Leone, a vice president at Caesars World Inc. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T has taken a somewhat different approach. Last year, it became the 
first U.S. company to air a regional television commercial with entirely 
Japanese dialogue, said Mark N. Burgess, AT&amp;T's acting director for 
international advertising. The 30-second ad, which had English subtitles, shows 
a Japanese-American man calling long-distance to a colleague in Japan to relate 
a joke told to him by his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Some Asian-American advertising executives, as well as the 157-page study 
published in December by Find/SVP, prefer AT&amp;T's general market approach, 
saying it's a waste of money to specifically target the Asian-American market. 
They say Asian cultures are too different to reach efficiently with one kind of 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though Asian people who come here have their own ethnic television, the 
majority are watching regular network TV," said Clifford Yuguchi, president of 
the Los Angeles advertising firm Bozell/Yuguchi Inc. "What companies ought to 
do is pull off some of those white people and show more Asians." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Ching, executive director of the Chinatown Service Center in Los 
Angeles, says she, too, would like to see more Asian-Americans on TV. But she 
said she is turned off by some efforts that have "racist and sexist" depictions 
of "Asian men as less than masculine and Asian women as exotic, desirable and 
subservient." She cited as particularly offensive the Singapore Airlines' 
"Singapore Girl" commercial that shows attractive female flight attendants 
serving passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Candiotti, a spokesman for Singapore Airlines, responded: "It's true that 
the presentation of Singapore girl has been one of our ongoing ad campaigns for 
several years. To us, the Singapore girl is symbolic of our high level of 
service. Their uniforms are actually quite modest; they wear ankle-length 
dresses. We do not view the ads as being sexist or racist." 
</P>
<P>
Although many marketers say they are moving away from unfavorable Asian 
caricatures, there are still slip-ups and outright mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
Playboy magazine once wished Chinese celebrants "Year New Happy" in a full-page 
newspaper ad. And Filipinos -- the nation's largest Asian-American group -- are 
sometimes mistakenly lumped with Latinos by marketers because Filipinos often 
have Spanish surnames. 
</P>
<P>
A more practical problem in reaching the Asian market is the lack of national 
media. Unlike Spanish-language television, which has two national broadcasting 
networks, there is no national Asian TV. Instead, regional systems -- such as 
KSCI Channel 18 in Los Angeles and KTSF Channel 26 in San Francisco -- provide 
programming in areas with large Asian populations. 
</P>
<P>
The print medium is even more fragmented. In Southern California, there are at 
least 15 Vietnamese-language newspapers, more than a dozen Chinese newspapers 
and three Japanese papers. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you are willing to get in there and get your hands dirty, the 
(Asian-American) market can be really intimidating," said Stoner of Artesa 
advertising. "You can't go out there with a typical kind of ad and try to be 
all things to all people." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, although Find/SVP agreed with other experts that Asian-Americans have a 
"commitment to obtaining products and services noted for having the 'best' 
quality" the study went on to conclude that: "In reality, each of the separate 
Asian-American ethnic groups is a separate ethnic market. The only 
characteristic they all have in common is their 'American-ness.' And it is only 
through their 'American-ness' that the various groups can be reached through 
the same marketing campaign."

A DOZEN WHO SHAPED THE 80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California's image as a pacesetter held up fairly well in the 1980s in the 
world of business and economics. Californians were a force for dramatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Some achieved change on a grand scale -- inspiring a revolution in economic 
policy or transforming corporate finance. Some of the change may seem minor, 
but it altered our daily routines and our life styles. Some business people 
built firms that are monuments to America's spirit of enterprise; others 
brought companies to ruin and became symbols of corporate recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of California residents who gave American business a 1980s 
makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ARTHUR B. LAFFER 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Arthur B. Laffer's name was a household word. The crusading 
analyst was a leader of the supply side movement, a band of ideological 
outsiders who stressed lower tax rates as the key to economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
But the outsiders became insiders in Ronald Reagan's White House. Laffer's 
famous mathematical curve gave the president an intellectual tool to justify 
tax cuts. And the efforts were rewarded when Congress slashed taxes in the 
Reagan years, dropping the top individual rate to 33% from 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have blamed Laffer and other tax-cut advocates for the federal budget 
deficit -- estimated at $152 billion in fiscal 1989 -- which has weakened the 
U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
But Laffer maintains that the cuts succeeded in stimulating economic growth and 
raising federal revenue; the deficit has persisted, he argues, because Congress 
failed to control spending. "The supply side won," he said last year. "We won." 
</P>
<P>
These days -- when not tending to his exotic collection of plants and animals 
-- Laffer, 49, spends most of his time on business travel. He is chairman of 
Laffer, Canto &amp; Associates, an economic consulting firm and merchant bank 
in La Jolla, and lives on a 17-acre mountain retreat in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a lower profile, he has kept a hand in politics. He mounted an 
unsuccessful bid in 1986 for the Republican senatorial nomination. Last summer, 
he was among a group of experts who advised President Bush on economic matters 
at a Camp David meeting. And in October he helped Rep. Ed Jenkins (D-Ga.) 
fashion a proposal to cut the capital gains tax, which prevailed on the House 
floor. JONATHAN PETERSON

INFLATION RATE TO SETTLE AT 4% IN 1990, S&amp;P SAYS; 
</P>

ECONOMY: PRICES FOR AUTOMOBILES, FOOD AND CLOTHING ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN FLAT. 
GAS HEATING, INSURANCE AND HEALTH-CARE COSTS COULD RISE.

<P>
The inflation rate for 1990 is likely to remain in the 4% range after an 
initial surge early in the year, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The December cold wave will leave us with a January hangover of higher prices 
for heating oil, other energy, and fresh fruits and vegetables," the financial 
services company said in its semiannual consumer price forecast. 
</P>
<P>
"Prices will return to their recent 4% track. By late in the year, the soft 
economy should push consumer price inflation even below that figure." 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P warned that the inflation trend, however moderate, will raise concern 
at the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with a soft economy, the Fed will continue to watch the inflation 
measures very carefully," the report said, stressing that the Fed has failed to 
bring the inflation rate close to the zero level during the past seven years of 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Cars and air fares are the indicators that will contribute the most toward 
keeping the inflation rate down, S&amp;P said. 
</P>
<P>
"Domestic automobile prices will remain flat or decline in 1990. . . . 
Slackening consumer demand will cause prices on many 1990 models to drop," 
Joshua Harari, S&amp;P auto analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
"Airlines will not be successful in raising their fares more than 1% to 2% in 
1990, and Eastern Airlines may continue to offer discounts in an effort to 
rebuild its traffic to prestrike levels," predicted Thomas Canning, S&amp;P 
airline analyst. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P analysts also expected prices for clothes and food items to remain 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
"Stable raw material, a flood of imports and a sluggish overall consumer 
market" will keep clothing prices at least at a stable level or possibly drive 
them lower, the report said. Food prices are projected to increase by 4% next 
year, down from 6% in 1989, with only luxury items and tomato products -- 
suddenly in high demand -- likely to go up. 
</P>
<P>
"An oversupply of restaurants -- more than 80,000 franchise chain outlets in 
the United States -- will also keep the price of eating out in check," the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
Major items expected to increase in price are gas heating, insurance rates and 
health-care costs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers should be prepared to shell out 8% to 9% for natural gas home fuel 
costs next year," the report warned, adding some good news for electricity 
consumers who should see only a small 2% rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
But oil industry analyst Edward Graves predicted that drivers would get a break 
as gasoline prices drop following a softening in crude oil prices "in early 
1990 from their current $21 a barrel to $19 a barrel." 
</P>
<P>
Graves predicted that overproduction by the 13 members of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries would drive prices down, with the cartel's output 
remaining at 23.5 million barrels a day, for a stagnant demand of 21 million 
barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
Medical bills should increase by more than twice the projected rate of 
inflation, in the double-digit range, reflecting expensive drugs, and cuts in 
Medicare and Medicaid programs, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The soaring health-care costs will be matched only by property and casualty 
premium hikes, in the 10% to 12% range, with insurers likely to work their way 
around legislation aimed at capping the rates.

AT&amp;T RINGS IN DECADE WITH STATE RATE CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new year and new decade spell lower telephone rates, effective this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph cut its prices for long-distance calling 
within California by an average of 8.6%, an annual savings to AT&amp;T 
customers of $113.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company earlier announced a $300-million reduction in tolls for calling 
between states and abroad, also effective New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Most local callers in the state also get a price break today. 
</P>
<P>
The California Public Utilities Commission ordered Pacific Bell's rates cut 
$391 million a year, effective Jan. 1, saving the residential customers about 
$1.15 on the typical $26 monthly bill. 
</P>
<P>
That reduction will appear as a percentage credit subtracted from January and 
subsequent bills until the PUC gets around, later this year, to recalculating 
the specific price changes for local services provided by Pacific Bell and the 
state's second largest local carrier, Thousand Oaks-based GTE California. 
(GTE's rates, which were sharply lowered a year ago, will start the new year 
unchanged.) 
</P>
<P>
The AT&amp;T rate cut will reduce the cost of a 5-minute, weekday call between 
Los Angeles or San Diego and San Francisco to $1.06 from $1.20. A 10-minute 
call anywhere in the nation will cost up to $2.50. Since Monday is a holiday, 
daytime rates are discounted by 33% to 47% after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokeswoman Linda McDougall attributed most of the reductions to state 
and federal regulators. All but $7 million of the California cut stems from a 
1985 order by the PUC that began a seven-year reduction in what long-distance 
carriers pay local phone companies for completing calls and a corresponding 
increase in what local customers pay Pacific Bel and GTE California. 
</P>
<P>
The interstate reduction is based on a similar cost shift ordered by the 
Federal Communications Commission, which regulates interstate service. Phone 
customers now pay a $3.50-a-month "subscriber line charge" to compensate local 
phone companies for revenue they used to collect from long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
In all, AT&amp;T rates for calling within California have dropped 45.5% in six 
years, while interstate rates fell 40%. AT&amp;T's long-distance competitors 
have generally cut their rates proportionately.

BMI Grants HBO One-Month License Extension: Broadcast Music Inc. has agreed to 
grant a one-month extension of its license to Home Box Office Inc. "at a 
substantially higher fee." 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came in negotiations between representatives of HBO and BMI. BMI 
said that the issues raised in the lawsuit filed on Dec. 28 are still 
unresolved and that unless the parties could reach agreement in January, the 
litigation will continue. BMI filed suit against HBO to obtain a preliminary 
injunction to prevent it from using BMI repertoire on the Home Box Office 
channel after HBO's license expires Dec. 31.

$10-Million Settlement for Gold Investors: The owner of two defunct gold 
investment firms agreed to repay more than 250 investors $10 million to settle 
two U.S. District Court suits accusing him of being unable to deliver on 
contracts for thousands of ounces of gold. William M. Moreland of Weldon, 
Calif., will pay back investors at a rate of $300,000 per month beginning in 
April, said Marge Erickson, an assistant regional director of the Federal Trade 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the refund stems from an FTC case against Moreland charging that he 
sold gold contracts during 1986-88 that were unlikely ever to be delivered 
through his two Beverly Hills units, Continental Trading International Ltd. and 
Axiom III. Moreland neither admitted nor denied the allegations. (Filed August 
8, 1989, Case No. CV89-4708)

Los Angeles Superior Court against MGM/UA Entertainment Co. The Saul Zaentz Co. 
of Berkeley accused MGM/UA with licensing two of its films -- "Cuckoo's Nest"

ROCKY MOUNTAIN WEST RECEIVING TOURISM BOOST FROM FAR EAST; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL INDUSTRY: AMERICA'S MOUNTAIN STATES HAVE BENEFITED FROM A MAJOR PUSH TO 
ATTRACT ASIAN TOURISTS TO THE REGION'S SCENIC VIEWS, FORESTS AND NATIONAL 
PARKS.

In every way but one, the slick new magazine that just hit the stands looks 
like every other travel mag you've picked up on airplanes and in doctors' 
offices. The articles consist of hyperbolic prose about "mountain splendor" and 
"natural wonders." The lavish color pictures show off Colorado's most scenic 
mountains, forests, rivers and national parks, and the advertisements promote 
hotels, restaurants, dude ranches and ski resorts. 
</P>
<P>
But this new journal, Colorado Gaido, is written entirely in Japanese, and the 
only newsstands where you can buy it are in Tokyo, Nagoya, Fukuoka and other 
Japanese cities. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado Gaido ("Colorado Guide") and its sister publication, Oregon Treiru 
("Oregon Trail"), both published by a Portland firm called Pacific Gateways, 
are key elements of a major new thrust across the Rocky Mountain West to 
attract tourists, and their money, from the nations of the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
"American travel markets have started focusing on the Pacific Rim as the 
high-growth area . . . the first priority," said Max Ollendorf, director of 
market development for the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration. The 
strongest push, he added, comes from the Western states. 
</P>
<P>
Manifestations of the new drive are evident throughout the region. On the ski 
slopes at big resorts like Deer Valley and Snowbird, you now see trail signs in 
Japanese as well as English. At the airport in Las Vegas, tour companies quote 
prices for their Grand Canyon sightseeing flights in yen as well as dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In the casinos at Las Vegas, you can now play Asian games of chance like Pai 
Gow and Sic Bo. At the edge of a forest not far from downtown Portland sits a 
perfect Japanese tea house, complete with tatami floors and sliding shoji 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to attract Asians is part of a larger pattern of change that is 
transforming the economic structure of the mountain West. With energy, mineral 
and timber markets in the doldrums, the Western states have been moving away 
from traditional extraction industries toward the attraction industry -- 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
"People have discovered that you can make more from a forest by leaving it in 
place and charging visitors to ski through it than you can by cutting it down 
and selling the timber," observed Sen. Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.). 
</P>
<P>
Because tourism is one of the fastest-growing industries in every Western 
state, it was natural to look for new markets. And for the states on the 
Pacific side of America, a natural place to look was the booming economies on 
the other side of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the travel councils of eight Western states pooled their money to 
fund a new promotional outfit called "Visit USA West," which exists for one 
purpose: to sell Asians on the natural wonders of the Rocky Mountain and 
Pacific Coast states. 
</P>
<P>
The sales effort seems to be scoring points. The number of Japanese tourists 
visiting Wyoming jumped this year to 8,000, double the figure for 1988, 
according to the state's Travel Development Office. Japanese skiing at resorts 
in Utah increased from "essentially zero" two years ago to 3,000 last season, 
the state Travel Council reports. 
</P>
<P>
The trend has been a boon in a part of the country that missed most of the 
1980s expansion. And since the money that foreign tourists spend here is 
counted as "export revenue" in national trade accounts, every skier from Tokyo 
schussing down Ajax Mountain at Aspen helps offset the U.S. trade deficit with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"Tourism is second only to aircraft and space equipment in total export 
revenue," said Jill Collins of the federal Travel and Tourism Administration. 
Foreign tourists spent an estimated $37.1 billion in the United States in 1988, 
a huge 25% increase over the year before. That means that foreign tourism is 
America's fastest-growing export commodity. And the Pacific Rim is the 
fastest-growing market for this "export." 
</P>
<P>
Although state tourism officials here all talk hopefully about drawing visitors 
from Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, the Pacific Rim market today is, for 
all intents and purposes, the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
For some states, this is nothing new. Hawaiian hotels have done a thriving 
trade in Japanese tour groups and honeymooners for two decades now. California 
has always been a big draw, and Alaska also has had a fairly large Japanese 
tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no such tradition for Oregon, a state whose name the Japanese 
have difficulty both pronouncing and spelling (a geography book used in 
Japanese schools shows a state called "Olegon"). And so Oregon's Division of 
Tourism set out to create an instant tradition. 
</P>
<P>
The state paid for the filming of a sentimental dramatic movie, "Oregon Nikki" 
("Oregon Diary"), which tells the story of a young Japanese boy living in 
Oregon who falls in love with the state and its natural beauty. The two-hour 
film is shown annually on the national Fuji Television network. 
</P>
<P>
The result? Recognition of the name "Oregon" among Japanese adults went from 
23% in 1986 to 78% this year. And the state broke all records by drawing about 
60,000 Asian tourists, mostly Japanese, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
For most Western states, however, appealing to Japanese tourists means breaking 
long-established routines. The standard route for Japanese travelers coming to 
Los Angeles has followed a path known in the Japanese travel trade as the 
"Golden Triangle." It consists of various stops around Los Angeles -- 
Disneyland, Universal Studios -- followed by a trip to Las Vegas, with a side 
trek to the Grand Canyon, followed by a stop in San Francisco and then the long 
flight home. 
</P>
<P>
To break that habit, the Western states are busily advertising such 
off-the-triangle wonders as Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, Colorado 
dude ranches and Salt Lake City's Temple Square. Much of this effort is aimed 
at tourists who have been to the United States once. "Many Japanese on their 
second visit don't want to go back to the same places again," explained Kasho 
Furuya, director of Pacific Rim sales for Las Vegas-based Scenic Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most successful campaign was the major promotion called "89 in 
'89." Created by Osamu "Sam" Hoshino of Utah's travel division and adopted by 
six major tour packagers in Tokyo, it took Japanese tourists along U.S. Highway 
89, the two-lane route sometimes called the most beautiful highway in America. 
The route starts at Glacier National Park on the Canadian border and winds 
south through Wyoming and Utah, passing near several other major parks before 
its terminus at the north rim of the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing is one of the major tourist businesses of the mountain region, but this 
fact has been lost on the Japanese until recently. Japanese skiers traveling 
overseas have traditionally gone to Europe or the Canadian Rockies. That, too, 
is beginning to change, thanks to major sales efforts by the big Rocky Mountain 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
At Utah's Deer Valley, for example, Japanese skiers are greeted by Japanese 
hosts when they arrive. The resort provides Japanese-speaking ski instructors 
and Japanese-language restaurant guides. 
</P>
<P>
The number of Japanese skiers choosing Colorado seems almost certain to 
increase now that Japanese investors have purchased two of its biggest resorts, 
Breckenridge and Steamboat Springs. 
</P>
<P>
To win the Japanese market, American travel destinations have to be creative. 
Dorothy Maitland, who owns a travel agency in Kalispell, Mont., has learned to 
be creative during the past five years while making Tokyo-to-Montana packages a 
key part of her business. 
</P>
<P>
When Maitland first got the idea, she said, she was stymied by the fact that 
the Japanese like to see the sights from a train. "I said, 'This is Montana. 
The only train we've got is Amtrak from Seattle to Chicago, and that goes 
through here in the middle of the night'." 
</P>
<P>
After stewing over this dilemma for a while, Maitland hit on the solution. She 
printed up a Japanese brochure promoting the midnight rail journey as a 
romantic adventure: "the Moonlight Express." 
</P>
<P>
And it worked. "We're selling tours on that moonlight train almost every day of 
the summer," she said. "And our Japanese customers are buying like mad."

Canadian shoppers have made this holiday season jolly for U.S. retailers, but

"The prices -- check it out," said Manny Hilario, 23, who drove 100 miles from 
Brampton, Ontario, to shop at the Factory Outlet Mall one recent Saturday. 
Outside, in an overflowing parking lot, Ontario plates outnumbered New York 
plates more than three to one. 
</P>
<P>
The crowded lots, long checkout lines and delays entering Canada on the area's 
three international bridges have caused tempers to rise at times. 
</P>
<P>
A group of six Niagara Falls residents announced recently that they were 
forming a group called "People Against Canadian Shoppers" to press local 
merchants to deal with the problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing against them (Canadians) personally, but we do think something 
could be done to improve the situation for everyone," Steve Hughes, a spokesman 
for the group, told the Niagara Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes said his group is circulating petitions blaming Canadians for everything 
from litter and rudeness to unsafely transporting gasoline across the border in 
extra tanks. 
</P>
<P>
That effort, in turn, has prompted U.S. business and tourism officials to 
hasten to assure Canadians that they are still welcome. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to blow this out of proportion and make out that there's a major war 
going on," said Ray Wigle, spokesman for the Niagara Falls Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
The convention and visitors bureau and the Niagara Falls Area Chamber of 
Commerce have urged businesses to clean up the trash and expand checkouts. 
Local governments have been asked to increase traffic control in order to 
reduce the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Local Canada Customs officials have asked the agency that operates the 
international bridges to expand the customs facilities and are trying to 
persuade Ottawa to allocate more staff. 
</P>
<P>
Same-day shopping traffic across the Rainbow and Whirlpool bridges has 
increased by almost 60% over the past four years, and at the Lewiston-Queenston 
bridge, the main route to major Canadian cities such as Hamilton and Toronto, 
traffic is up 107% over that period, said John Johnston, district manager for 
Canada Customs operations in Niagara Falls. 
</P>
<P>
Theories abound as to why the number of shoppers has multiplied, though the 
year-old U.S.-Canada free trade pact isn't considered a direct cause. The 
agreement has reduced wholesale tariffs on several categories of merchandise 
but has not yet affected the duties paid by individual shoppers at the border. 
</P>
<P>
Still, free trade may have subtly boosted cross-border shopping by helping to 
strengthen the Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar trades at about 85 U.S. 
cents these days after falling as low as 70 cents earlier in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Niagara Falls, N.Y., also has a built-in price advantage because western New 
York is one of the cheaper regions of the United States, but Niagara Falls, 
Ontario, is an extension of the pricey Toronto metropolitan area, Wigle said. 
</P>
<P>
Price is not the only attraction of the United States, some Canadian shoppers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"In groceries, anything new they come out with (in the United States) is in 
Canada the year after," said Lisa Morrice of Hamilton, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. grocery chains began advertising heavily across the border in the past few 
months after seeing the stronger dollar and the increased willingness of 
Canadians to cross the bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian merchants say they can't compete with U.S. prices.

California's image as a pacesetter held up fairly well in the 1980s in the 
world of business and economics. Californians were a force for dramatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Some achieved change on a grand scale -- inspiring a revolution in economic 
policy or transforming corporate finance. Some of the change may seem minor, 
but it altered our daily routines and our life styles. Some business people 
built firms that are monuments to America's spirit of enterprise; others 
brought companies to ruin and became symbols of corporate recklessness. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of California residents who gave American business a 1980s 
makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL MILKEN 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken arguably has had a greater impact on American business in the 
1980s than anyone else. The 43-year-old trader radically transformed the world 
of American finance by pioneering the $210-billion market for high-risk, 
high-yield debt securities known as junk bonds -- and then landed squarely at 
the center of the nation's biggest securities fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
In fostering the junk bond market, Milken helped touch off an unprecedented 
wave of merger and acquisition activity. Some entrepreneurs built vital 
businesses with the money that Milken raised for them, and corporate raiders 
were able to launch takeovers against industry giants by using almost no money 
of their own. In many instances, as companies sought to defend themselves or as 
raiders dismantled their prey, workers were laid off by the thousands. 
Investment bankers and shareholders often walked away rich and happy. 
</P>
<P>
When Milken started work as a bond trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert in New 
York, a junk bond was debt issued by a "fallen angel," a once highly regarded 
company that had fallen on hard times. Small and mid-size companies were rarely 
able to borrow from anyone but a bank, and even that wasn't easy. But Milken 
helped hundreds of smaller firms issue bonds in the public markets in the way 
that big companies did. 
</P>
<P>
For a long while, the business was good for both Drexel, which became a 
financial powerhouse, and Milken, who earned $500 million in one year and ranks 
among the wealthiest men in America. But Drexel and Milken were charged with 
massive securities fraud. Drexel has pleaded guilty and paid a huge fine; its 
business is suffering. As for Milken, he is fighting a 98-count indictment on 
similar matters and hopes to stay out of jail. He maintains his innocence and 
has started a new financial advisory firm. KATHY M. KRISTOF

<P>
</P>
<P>
SOL PRICE 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1976, San Diego retail executive Sol Price opened a bare-bones, 
cash-and-carry store in an aircraft-hangar-sized building in an industrial 
section of his hometown. It marked the birth of a store, as well as the birth 
of an idea -- warehouse membership outlets that cater to small-business owners 
and consumers who want rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, that idea was transformed into a booming industry. But even 
as a flock of copycat companies opened similar stores, the Price Club chain 
remained a leader. 
</P>
<P>
Price, now in his early 70s and no longer running the company, was the first to 
recognize that "a real basic need of small-business customers was not being 
met," said Sarah Stack, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And, she added, "He saw that consumers were able to forgo some creature 
comforts to get the best price possible." 
</P>
<P>
Price also was early to recognize, among other things, the value of what is 
known as vertical integration, Stack said. One example: After the Price Club 
started offering optical lenses, it also got into the business of grinding 
lenses so that it could offer the product at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas H. Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities, said another 
important innovation by Price was the introduction of a customer newsletter 
about developments at the stores. Such newsletters, he said, now are regarded 
"as a vital component of the business." STUART SILVERSTEIN

makeover -- making it better, or worse, or just more fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A. W. CLAUSEN 
</P>
<P>
A.W. (Tom) Clausen -- as BankAmerica Corp.'s once and future chief executive in 
the 1980s -- was the architect both for one of the decade's biggest corporate 
declines and one of its biggest comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
He was blamed for many of BankAmerica's troubles earlier in the decade, such as 
leaving its Bank of America unit with a huge portfolio of Latin American loans 
that soured, as well as building an inefficient, bloated bank with an outmoded 
computer system. 
</P>
<P>
BankAmerica's problems went beyond those loans: Key executives left amid 
turmoil, morale was low, the bank suffered an embarrassing mortgage scandal, 
and its stock was battered on Wall Street. So vulnerable was BankAmerica that 
First Interstate Bancorp launched an unsolicited $3.4-billion takeover bid in 
late 1986 that BankAmerica ultimately fought off. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it also was Clausen who returned to lead BankAmerica through a 
Chrysler-like turnaround. Clausen, 66, had left BankAmerica, the San 
Francisco-based parent of Bank of America, in 1981 to head the World Bank. 
BankAmerica was a shambles when Clausen was asked by its board to return in 
1986 to replace his successor, Samuel H. Armacost, who resigned under fire. 
</P>
<P>
Under Clausen, BankAmerica became profitable again by slashing costs, improving 
loan quality, selling assets and pushing consumer banking. More important, 
Clausen brought in a team of key executives to work the turnaround, notably 
former Seafirst Corp. President Richard M. Rosenberg, 59, who is now 
BankAmerica vice chairman and the executive considered most likely to succeed 
Clausen. 
</P>
<P>
But the clout that BankAmerica once enjoyed worldwide has diminished from the 
days when it was the nation's largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
Clausen has not indicated when he may retire. Observers speculate that he may 
leave in a year or two. JAMES BATES

THE STAR ATTRACTION OF HOLLYWOOD'S CHINA CLUB; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: CELEBRITIES OFTEN PLAY AT THE LATE-NIGHT HOT SPOT, WHERE EVERYBODY 
-- EVERYBODY WHO CAN GET IN -- IS SOMEBODY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The long-haired young man seemed a bit fazed on a recent Monday night when the 
doorman at Hollywood's China Club wouldn't let him enter the nightclub. After a 
trip to the side door, the man returned to explain to the doorman that he'd 
been told he would be allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
"OK, so what's your name?" asked the doorman, a tall New Yorker in a beige 
trench coat. 
</P>
<P>
The young man paused. "Well . . . Axl." 
</P>
<P>
The doorman stiffened. "That's good enough for me," he said, sweeping aside the 
people waiting to clear the entry for one W. Axl Rose, the lead singer of Guns 
N' Roses. 
</P>
<P>
It's all par for the course at the China Club, the hottest nitery in town since 
it opened in August, where class division is the rule -- and perhaps the 
attraction. Before the Axl incident, as the club prepared for its 10 p.m. 
opening, the same doorman gave those waiting a convoluted explanation of how 
the entry system worked. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're on the guest list, get in this line," he said, indicating the 
20-person queue to the left of the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not on the guest list, you have to wait here," he continued, 
motioning to a slightly longer line at the right. "Now, if you only think 
you're on the guest list, you might not be. So, unless you know you're on the 
list, don't stand in the guest-list line." 
</P>
<P>
Sound inviting? It is to many in Hollywood who all-too willingly stand in line 
-- especially on Mondays when a star-studded jam session draws celebrity guests 
only a notch below the rumors -- so they can pay $10 to be sardined around the 
elongated horseshoe bar or on the dance floor -- where it's too crowded to 
dance and too loud to talk -- and pay five bucks a pop for mixed drinks. (The 
"pro-jam" will be held tonight and, beginning next week, on Tuesdays as well.) 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, everybody's somebody here," said Stephen Eads, who has served as 
general manager of the club since it opened in August. But, of course, some 
people are more somebody than others at the China Club, a three-level, 
400-capacity facility at the Selma and Argyle site that once housed the 
punk-era Cathay de Grande. 
</P>
<P>
Though the club is used frequently for record companies to showcase 
up-and-coming artists, it's the Monday-night jams that get the buzz going. A 
few weeks ago, Elton John hopped on stage to lead the band through nine songs. 
Michael Bolton and Rick James are among those known to turn up. Even rocker 
wanna-be John McEnroe plugged in his guitar recently. 
</P>
<P>
And the rumors! 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Jeff Beck, maybe Phil Collins, maybe Eric Clapton," said club publicist 
Joe D'Ambrosio as the cozy, understatedly Chinese-themed main room started to 
fill up. On this occasion the rumors proved a bust (as was one about Paul 
McCartney the week before) -- the crowd had to "settle" for Sam Kinison and 
Gary Busey destroying "Wild Thing," plus the now-standard guest appearance of 
Who bassist John Entwistle. Word persisted through the evening that Beck was in 
the club, but that proved untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some people are more somebody than others, and that is certainly, at 
least in part, what draws the lesser somebodies. 
</P>
<P>
"The general public is used to being slighted, watching premieres and parties 
on TV that they can't go to," said Belissa Cohen, who covers the night life for 
the L.A. Weekly. "So when they see it right in front of them, they're 
privileged to be there. If you see Madonna walk ahead of you to the front of 
the line, you know you're in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, on that Monday, they did see Madonna, with close-cropped dark hair, 
walk by with Warren Beatty. The celebrated pair took their places at a table in 
one of the elevated areas that flanks the narrow ground-floor room where the 
nightly entertainment takes place. Others in the star contingent this night 
included Justine Bateman, actor Danny Aiello -- his son Ricky was the doorman 
that night. And Lakers owner Jerry Buss and party held a table throughout the 
night separate from, though in sight of, the hoi polloi. A guarded VIP room 
downstairs held more celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
"They make it comfortable here," Buss said while the loud house band, the Nasty 
Survivors, took a break and made conversation possible. "The security's real 
good -- you don't have to have your bodyguards." 
</P>
<P>
But, for all that, the China Club is fairly egalitarian, as these clubs go. 
There's none of that trendy snobbery about style that people accustomed to the 
likes of Vertigo expect. Both the celebs and the common folk tend to favor the 
casual look here. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the rock 'n' roll business, not the snob business," insisted Danny 
Fried, who co-owns both this club and its New York namesake, which has served 
as a successful, celebrity-filled hot spot for five years. "We don't play the 
'We don't like your clothes' games. . . . The only times it gets tight at the 
door is when it's too busy. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not a trendy kind of place," he continued. "We are in the music 
business. I don't cater to kids; we cater to an older, sophisticated crowd. 
That's why I'm so happy that top musicians have frequented the place. They know 
if they play they're gonna sound good and play to a crowd that appreciates it." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Buss appreciates it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only place (like it) with live entertainment in L.A., which is 
strange for the entertainment capital of the world, that we would have to 
import that from New York," Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
And even those who have to wait in line outside, often for more than half an 
hour, appreciate it too. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in L.A. for a year, and this is one of the best places I've been," 
said Erika Hjelm, a fashion designer from Switzerland, as she stood with her 
brother Jonas, a USC student. 
</P>
<P>
And the pair insisted that they'd like the club even if it weren't a great 
place for star-gazing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd still come even if there were no celebrities," said Erika. 
</P>
<P>
Belissa Cohen agreed that it's more than being able to rub elbows with the 
aristocracy that brings the public to the China Club. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be in there without knowing that David Bowie and Axl are over there," 
she said. "Some people find the conservative atmosphere pleasant. That's enough 
for them. They don't want to deal with the underground and the trendiness." 
</P>
<P>
But, if not for the impressive guest list, you'd have to wonder if the club 
could remain the hottest place in town. It certainly wouldn't draw the 
paparazzi who stake out the club religiously. 
</P>
<P>
"We give the club a lot of publicity," said celebrity photographer Al Ortega 
during his vigil. "Stuff we shoot here gets published." 
</P>
<P>
At 2:15 in the morning, after the club had closed, Ortega and several 
colleagues were still working, coaxing a complaining Justine Bateman to 
dutifully pose as she headed across Argyle to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the China Club's magic is working. But even those who are impressed 
expect it will wear off eventually. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," marveled one record industry executive, who asked his name not 
be used because he might need to book some of his acts there in the future. "I 
wonder how long will it last."

CRITIC AT LARGE: HOPES ARISE WITH THE DAWN OF A NEW DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like birthdays, years divisible by 10 have a special aura about them. In the 
case of our private birthdays, the aura gets darker and darker as the numbers 
go up. Turning 50 has a chill about it, like a cloud passing the face of the 
sun, and let us not speak of 60 at all. 
</P>
<P>
The world's birthdays have no such darkening auras, and it is a small miracle 
of our lives that no matter how dark things have been for the individual or the 
world up through Dec. 31, New Year's Eve always carries the hope that things 
will change for the better. The hope may be as thin as a penlight at the end of 
a very long tunnel, as it has often been in wartime. But the hope is there, 
because things have always gotten better before, or so you tell yourself as the 
bells ring and the horns toot in the crisp night air. 
</P>
<P>
Even in the hard, realistic light of New Year's morning, a guarded optimism is 
at very least an allowable state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
And if the old year has ended up in a rush of good news, personal or 
collective, as this one surely has collectively speaking, then the new year 
begins with a sense of possibility that is headier than any Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
The year 1989, lately dead, and the ending decade have been memorialized and 
analyzed to a true fare-thee-well. And seeing the bits of film and tape, 
hearing the litany of new voices discovered and familiar voices gone still, and 
glimpsing again the triumphs and the tragedies, it is impressive to realize how 
much we've all borne witness to. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Mort Sahl once remarked in an album title, the future lies ahead, and 
the view from New Year's morning is indubitably ahead. Not to those 
intimidating resolutions. Yes, yes; we're all going to eat less and exercise 
more and save more and be better persons in each and every way, at least 
through Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Resolutions, unreal to begin with, tend to have rather short lives. On the 
other hand there are hopes -- and the first day of any year is nothing if not a 
time of hope -- that should last longer than the resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
I hope, for example, that the movie makers will rethink the prevailing 
conventional wisdom that only home runs count. Singles and doubles have a place 
in the Hollywood scheme of things too. Those swollen budgets, averaging $18 
million to $20 million but occasionally peaking at twice that or more, have 
deprived the movies of one of their greatest strengths -- variety. Variety in 
size, themes, tone, casting. 
</P>
<P>
The argument always is that little pictures cost as much to distribute as big 
ones so you're better off making big ones that have more selling points. The 
trouble is that the big budgets carry timid compromises, like barnacles. 
</P>
<P>
There are signs of hope already in the success of modest-cost films such as 
"sex, lies, and videotape," "Do the Right Thing" and even, in its limited 
showings, Kenneth Branagh's "Henry V." The hope at last is for more hope. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the television networks read the handwriting on the screen about their 
still-declining share of prime-time viewing. They are losing to cable, to 
independents, to VCRs. Indeed, their share of viewing time may be even lower 
than the measurers can measure. 
</P>
<P>
And what, the networks might well ask, are their viewers viewing instead? Even 
less objectionable programming, which is to say, even blander and more 
derivative stuff? Not exactly. A lot more sports, certainly, on cable, which 
feeds an evidently insatiable appetite in the society. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond sports, what we watch appears to be a mosaic of what you can only call 
the good stuff, films and specials for cable (the networks abandoned variety 
shows too quickly), plays, documentaries, profiles, news in breadth and depth 
and, not without a touch of irony, the best of what network television did in 
the past, the excellence of which now also carries a heavy icing of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
The networks' old quest for LOP (Least Objectionable Programming) is obviously 
an inadequate response to the new challenge they face. The hope is that they 
will try upgrading their offerings to a viewership that is now anything but 
captive. 
</P>
<P>
Television's not a wasteland; never was, entirely. There were oases in the 
thinnest of times, and the medium's inventiveness and immediacy have at their 
best been spectacular. The power of television's news coverage increasingly 
shapes history as well as recording it. But even here the networks are under 
siege from CNN and other quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The hope, I think, is for a counteroffensive by the networks, taking risks and 
showing their undoubted muscle, instead of cutting costs and plotting spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
I can't say I hope, but I wish that the pop music I hear seemed to originate 
deeper in the soul. For a time in the '60s particularly, the voices of rock 
spoke for a generation and reflected, early on, its angers and concerns, its 
rejection of what it saw as outworn values but its essentially positive 
aspirations for change. 
</P>
<P>
Today much of what I hear, or read about, seems to me to reflect the 
disenchantment of senders and receivers. It's hard not to sense a strained 
quest for commercial novelty, preferably built on shock value. Cynicism 
pervades the music, or probably more accurately the industry. 
</P>
<P>
It seems no accident that the possibility of a Beatles reunion holds such 
fascination for so many, or that the individual Beatle tours have done so well. 
There is a terrific nostalgia for the (relative) innocence and the romantic 
idealism that their music carried in the '60s when they owned the world. 
</P>
<P>
It is also no accident that someone like Bruce Springsteen, who has a point of 
view and whose attraction is therefore lyrical as well as musical, should 
command such a following. 
</P>
<P>
(I remember watching a 1965 rehearsal of the Byrds and a young man beside me 
shouting, "This is it! Facade show business is dead!" It isn't; it just uses 
megawatt amplifiers and wears artfully torn jeans. 
</P>
<P>
My hope, I guess, is that out there somewhere are new composer-musicians who 
are looking beyond a facile and fashionable cynicism to find new angers and 
concerns. It may well be beyond them, but we can not give up the possibility of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
There is a banquet of subsidiary hopes lurking about. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the theater will rediscover the lean, sophisticated musical as an 
alternative to the overwhelmingly spectacular musical. I hope for the spirit of 
Rodgers and Hart, as well as revivals of Rodgers and Hart. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the Los Angeles Theatre Center will hang in there, while more and more 
customers find their way to it and discover that it is a safe and exciting 
oasis in an undeniably off-putting part of downtown. The operating losses have 
not dimmed Bill Bushnell's daring as a producer, and I hope they never will. 
</P>
<P>
I hope the writers of crime fiction will ease off on drunken private eyes and 
serial killers; both are becoming not so much bores as trivializations. 
</P>
<P>
To end on a more cosmic level, I hope -- no, I pray -- that Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev holds his own against the troglodytic Old Guardsman who undoubtedly 
lie in wait for him. He has diverted us all from a collision course with 
catastrophe. The world is not free of terror or terrorists but it is 
immeasurably saner than it was a year ago, and a hope for more of the same fits 
this morning like none other.

HIDDEN POPULATION POSES CENSUS WINDFALL FOR CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It was a natural fear, and Quach Tho Ninh was no different than the rest. In 
the grim months after the fall of Saigon in 1975, Vietnamese authorities would 
conduct an occasional head count, marching house to house with automatic rifles 
slung over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
This was only a census, but the questions invariably strayed. Were you in the 
army of the south? What are your beliefs? Your politics? Quach would always 
give the correct responses, the answers that would keep him alive. 
</P>
<P>
Now more than a decade has passed. Quach has come to Orange County, hoping for 
a new life. One recent day, the 46-year-old immigrant was sitting in an 
English-language class, grappling with strange new vowels and syllables, when a 
visitor appeared -- a man from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
This, Quach soon realized, was different than the homeland. The census 
employee, a slight Vietnamese man named Vong Ngo, softened up the class with a 
few one-liners in his native tongue, then explained the importance of the 
nationwide survey. 
</P>
<P>
The spiel did the trick. Afterward, Quach, without fear, was eager to 
participate in the U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
Such small victories, however, could prove the exception rather than the rule 
when the 1990 census is launched in late March. While the past decade saw 
perhaps the greatest influx of foreign newcomers in Orange County's history, 
many of those immigrants from south of the border and Indochina might go 
uncounted in the upcoming national survey. 
</P>
<P>
They are among the nation's hidden population, which also includes the 
homeless: families tucked into garages or vans, and drifters with no fixed 
addresses. Wary of the government and its emissaries, both recent immigrants 
and the homeless typically are not counted in the U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
Although the census missed about 1.4% of the overall U.S. populace in 1980, the 
undercount was greater among minorities, with the rate of omission for black 
and Latino inner-city residents pegged at 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The undercount is unfortunate, since the census serves as an important 
springboard for help. It bears directly on the distribution of about $30 
billion in federal aid and millions more in state subsidies for a variety of 
programs. Each city's share of that money is generally based on its numbers of 
poor, homeless or unemployed people. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials contend that the 1990 census can overcome the daunting 
obstacles to produce a reasonably complete count, even among immigrants and in 
the pockets of poverty that lace Orange County and other communities. The 
bureau has pressed ahead with a spate of programs to reach the types of people 
who have been overlooked in past decades. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, census officials will enlist the help of churches, schools 
and social service agencies. Outreach specialists have been dispatched to give 
presentations to community organizations, adult English-language classes and 
Head Start groups. 
</P>
<P>
Census officials also plan to hire temporary employees directly from the ethnic 
minority neighborhoods, marching into apartment complexes and housing projects 
to make a pitch for recruits. By tapping workers from the community, officials 
hope to ease the tensions and worries of residents facing the census. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County cities such as Santa Ana have also helped, promoting the census 
with videos on local cable channels and distributing literature. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau, meanwhile, is gearing up for an ambitious, one-night 
campaign to count the homeless. Dubbed "shelter and street night," the special 
push is expected to far surpass the bureau's past enumeration efforts, which 
have focused on flophouses and other places of refuge. 
</P>
<P>
But several problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau's promotional literature in Spanish and other languages has 
largely failed to materialize in district offices throughout the United States. 
Aghast at the information gap, a nonprofit Latino group has stepped in to 
provide pamphlets in Spanish for many regions of the country. 
</P>
<P>
For the Indochinese communities in Orange County, local census officials have 
resorted to producing their own literature, drawing up and photocopying 
rudimentary pamphlets for distribution. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond logistical glitches, critics also see problems with the census form. The 
questionnaire comes only in English, with a small paragraph at the bottom 
giving a toll- free number to order a copy in Spanish. The form is unavailable 
in Vietnamese, Chinese or any of the scores of other languages spoken in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Our feeling is a lot of people will not even see the paragraph at the bottom 
of the census saying they can request one in Spanish," said Berta Saavedra, 
state census coordinator for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education 
Fund. "It could cause problems. And it's even worse for people who speak other 
languages." 
</P>
<P>
Census officials attribute such drawbacks mostly to a lack of funds. But they 
insist the informational literature will be arriving at most district offices 
in January. They also stress that residents who speak another language can get 
help at special translation centers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a concern," said Fernando Tafoya, a census district manager in Orange 
County. "But it's up to all of us on the local level to get the word out, and I 
feel we've got all the bases covered. The literature is important, but what's 
even more important is the personal contact we hope to establish." 
</P>
<P>
Such a face-to-face approach could prove invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
Undocumented immigrants, most of them Latinos settled in cities such as Santa 
Ana and Anaheim, fear the census will be used by immigration officials to track 
them down. (Illegal immigrants are counted by the census, despite repeated 
efforts by some congressmen to repeal the practice.) Even those granted legal 
status under the amnesty program are sometimes filled with distrust or don't 
understand the benefits of being counted, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
New arrivals from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos carry not only fears imported from 
their homelands, but a suspicion that the census might help housing authorities 
root out large families packed into cramped apartments in immigrant enclaves 
like Orange County's Little Saigon in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our efforts have to be aimed at saturating the community with accurate 
information about the census," said Father Jaime Soto, vicar of the Hispanic 
community for the Catholic Diocese of Orange. "We need to get out the message 
that the information is confidential, and that the census could actually help 
them a lot." 
</P>
<P>
The news is only beginning to trickle out. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of Natividad, a 26-year-old Latino woman in Santa Ana. An 
illegal immigrant who asked that only her first name be used, Natividad said 
she did not know what the census is. The mother of four also said she feared 
filling out government forms because of what she believes is the threat of 
deportation. 
</P>
<P>
But Maria, another undocumented immigrant, said she planned to participate in 
the census, even though many of her friends are too frightened to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"My friends have a lot of concern that the census is a way the government can 
find out we are here illegally," said Maria, 23, who learned about the 
nationwide survey from a Spanish-language news program. 
</P>
<P>
There are others just like them, in Anaheim, in Westminster, in Santa Ana and 
Garden Grove. And that is where people like Vong Ngo come in. 
</P>
<P>
A bespectacled 29-year-old with a wife and two children, Ngo came to the United 
States as a boat person in 1980 after five years under the communist regime in 
Vietnam. Now a community outreach specialist for the Census Bureau, he spends 
his days combing the Indochinese communities throughout Southern California, 
urging people to come forward and be counted. 
</P>
<P>
So it was that he arrived one recent day for a presentation at Cambodian Family 
Inc., a nonprofit community services agency in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Talking in a mix of English and Vietnamese, Ngo stressed that the census is 
confidential. Moreover, he pointed out how the count would actually help the 
community. More money would come for day-care centers, for health care, for 
sidewalks on a street. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to explain it in terms of how it will help their own neighborhood and 
family," Ngo said. "That's why these presentations are important. But there's 
never enough. There is no way that we can spread out the message to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
Across town, Tafoya was delivering a similar talk to a room packed with about 
50 young Latino families at a community center. A murmur filled the room and 
small children in hooded jackets squirmed at their parents' feet as Tafoya 
spoke in English. But the audience grew attentive when he broke into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Tafoya talked of building bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"You're sort of in their environment when you come out to these meetings," he 
said. "It strengthens the relationship. And it helps that we're going to give 
some of them a job with the census. The others know that their neighbor is not 
going to do something to hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
But it is a fragile trust. Some community leaders argue that unconnected events 
such as an immigration sweep a few days or weeks before the census could 
convince many immigrants not to participate. They have asked the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service for a moratorium on sweeps in the months before the 
census. 
</P>
<P>
"If they decide to raid, it'll put a damper on a complete count," said 
Saavedra. "These people don't understand that one hand of the federal 
government doesn't always know what the other is doing. When they think of the 
government, they think of the INS, IRS, FBI. It all begins to run together." 
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau faces no less troubling a dilemma with the homeless. 
Street-corner preachers and bedraggled bag ladies drifting on the periphery of 
society often hold a chilling animosity toward any type of government 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for the 1990 count, census officials have been putting their heads 
together with homeless advocates and others to pinpoint all the shelters and 
street locations that need to be visited. 
</P>
<P>
On March 20, the massive operation will begin across the country. Shelters and 
low-cost motels will be visited between 6 p.m. and midnight. Streets will be 
searched the next morning from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. Sleeping persons will not be 
awakened, but enumerators will estimate as best they can the person's age and 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Even with such tactics, a percentage of the United States' hidden population 
will likely remain uncounted, experts say. For many cities, that will mean less 
federal money for streets, social services and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, for instance, officials estimate that $2.5 million a year could 
be lost during the coming decade if the city's estimated 50,000 Latino 
newcomers are omitted. Officials in Los Angeles, which has an even greater 
variety of needy immigrants, say their city stands to lose $12 million annually 
if there is an under-count. 
</P>
<P>
"It boils down to the fact that if we do not count everybody, these people will 
not exist on paper," noted Santa Ana Councilman Miguel A. Pulido. "Everything 
from reapportionment to tax dollars will be affected." 
</P>
<P>
Eager to ensure an accurate tally, many state and city officials are pushing 
for the Census Bureau to use a new technique it has developed to estimate the 
nation's hidden population and adjust the census accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is similar to a 100-year-old method for counting fish in a lake. 
Immediately after the census, an intense recount will be conducted of 150,000 
randomly selected households across the country, including neighborhoods that 
have been habitually undercounted. By comparing the survey results against the 
census, the percentage of residents not included in the original count can be 
estimated. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was initially endorsed by several key officials with the Census 
Bureau, but the Reagan Administration rejected the technique, prompting 
protests from critics who accused the president of playing politics. 
</P>
<P>
As the critics saw it, the Republican president opposed the concept because of 
a probable rise in population totals in areas that are Democratic strongholds. 
As a result, those regions would gain Congressional seats and more federal 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Several large states and cities, including California and Los Angeles, sued to 
reverse Reagan's decision. The result was a settlement in 1989 that created an 
eight-member committee that will recommend whether the survey results should be 
used to adjust the nation's population. 
</P>
<P>
But politics could still come into play, the survey's advocates contend, 
because the final decision, expected in mid-July, rests with Secretary of 
Commerce Robert Mosbacher, a Republican political appointee. 
</P>
<P>
While the intrigue continues in Washington, the mood in Orange County has 
remained one of optimism, of hope that all segments of society will be counted 
on April 1, Census Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hoping the census will be the beginning of a reorientation in the way we 
see ourselves here in Orange County," Father Soto said. "One of the critical 
issues facing the county will be ethnic pluralism, how we choose to engage the 
reality of who we are. The census could be a pivotal beginning to bringing that 
reality to us and making us face it."

SITTING IT OUT: Those wanting to cheer on Orange County entries in today's Rose 
Parade will be disappointed. . . . Despite a history of entries that extends, 
with lapses, back to 1917 when Santa Ana first entered, there will be no float 
from here this year. . . . "We're cutting back on all the frills," a Santa Ana 
City Hall spokesman explained. Instead, the city will be represented by the 
Santa Ana Winds Youth Band, appearing 110th in the line of march. Steve Emmons

WHAT'S NEW? From The Times Orange County in 1979: "The '70s are likely to be 
remembered as the end of Orange County's free-wheeling growth . . . roads grew 
more crowded. Environmental concerns led to constraints on development. Many 
young adults lost the American Dream of owning a house. . . . Perhaps the 
brightest note during the '70s was the rebound of Orange County's economy. . . 
. Housing and transportation . . . will be Orange County's most goading issues"

It was a decade in which Laura Bradbury disappeared from a stark desert 
campsite, a small boy survived an inferno set by his father, the county got its 
first billionaire, septuplets were born, mountain lions attacked children and 
an animal shelter was chosen to house the homeless. Winnie the Pooh went on 
trial, Richard M. Nixon went to New York, Anaheim went up in smoke, the 
Olympics came and went, and the price of a house went through the roof. Here's 
a closer look at some of the events that made headlines in Orange County in the 
1980s: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1983: The year of the Decade 
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE: 
</P>
<P>
Stanton Police Officer Anthony Sperl, called to an apartment because neighbors 
had not seen the family for days, went in to investigate. Startled by a dim 
figure brandishing a handgun, Sperl fired and killed Patrick Ridge, 5, who had 
been left home alone by his working mother. Patrick had been holding a toy 
revolver. 
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC INTENTIONS: 
</P>
<P>
Charles Rothenberg, a waiter on vacation from New York, checked into a Buena 
Park motel room, put his 6-year-old son David to bed, doused the room with 
kerosene, then set it ablaze and fled. David survived but was horribly burned 
and faced years of plastic surgery and pain. His father, begging forgiveness at 
his trial, was sentenced to 13 years in prison and is due for parole in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
CAUGHT AT LAST: 
</P>
<P>
Two California Highway Patrol officers routinely stopped a car on Interstate 5 
in Mission Viejo and found a dead Marine in the seat next to the driver, Randy 
Kraft. That discovery ended a string of murders so long that prosecutors say 
they may never know the total. Six years after his arrest, Kraft was convicted 
of 16 murders, but prosecutors think that he may have committed 65 or more, the 
most in U.S. history. The trial was the county's longest (13 months, with five 
years of preparation) and most expensive (an estimated $10 million). 
</P>
<P>
DENTISTRY DEATHS: 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Tony Protopappas, who built a million-dollar practice based on painless 
dentistry, was arrested and later convicted of second-degree murder after three 
patients died from his anesthesia. Protopappas was an "unqualified, arrogant 
man" who used methods as reckless as "shooting a gun into a crowd," his 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
FIRST BILLIONAIRE: 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren bought control of the Irvine Co., moved to Orange County and 
instantly became its biggest wheel. 
</P>
<P>
LAST (BUT LONG) HURRAH: 
</P>
<P>
Joan Irvine Smith, great-granddaughter of the Irvine, whose ranch once covered 
one-fifth of Orange County's territory, spent three decades fighting for what 
she considered her legacy -- the Irvine Co. stock she inherited. But she was so 
at odds with new owner Bren that she decided to sell him her stock rather than 
associate with him. Hers has been a lengthy exit, however. The lawsuit over the 
selling price persists into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
PIER PRESSURE: 
</P>
<P>
Huge waves from offshore winter storms ripped away a section of the Seal Beach 
Pier. The waves returned three months later to finish the job, this time 
tearing away the end of the Huntington Beach Pier, including the End Cafe. (See 
"Goodby Again.") 
</P>
<P>
LABOR OF LOVE: 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Holland, working virtually single-handed for 13 1/2 years in his front 
yard in Costa Mesa, hand-wrought a 100-foot wooden brigantine according to 
19th-Century plans and christened it Pilgrim. As it slid into Newport Harbor, 
2,500 people cheered and scores of boats tooted -- probably the biggest and 
most festive launching crowd in the harbor's history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Rest of the Decade. . . 
</P>
<P>
CAUGHT AT LAST II: 
</P>
<P>
The Night Stalker, who sneaked into homes to rape and murder, struck in Mission 
Viejo and sent Orange County residents scurrying to buy guard dogs and guns 
(1985). Both Mission Viejo victims survived, and the attack provided the clue 
that broke the case. A 13-year-old boy's description of a suspicious vehicle 
led police to a Texas drifter, Richard Ramirez. Convicted of 13 murders but 
defiant to the end, Ramirez was sentenced to death four years later in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
INFERNO:

A tree swaying in a severe Santa Ana wind brushed a power line. The resulting 
fire gutted an entire section of Anaheim. The epic blaze destroyed 50 buildings 
containing 525 apartments and turned 1,200 people into instant homeless. The 
damage was estimated at $50 million. Miraculously, no one was seriously injured 
(1982). 
</P>
<P>
INFERNO II: 
</P>
<P>
Six months after the Anaheim conflagration, a brush fire erupted in Gypsum 
Canyon behind Orange and spread to the nearby, very pricey Crest de Ville 
community. Twelve homes were leveled there and three others nearby (1982). 
</P>
<P>
TERRORISM AT HOME: 
</P>
<P>
Alex M. Odeh, 41, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Defamation 
Committee, opened his office door in Santa Ana and was fatally injured by a 
bomb. The FBI's suspicions fell on members of the Jewish Defense League, but no 
arrests have been made (1985). 
</P>
<P>
FERTILITY RECORD: 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Frustaci checked into St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and delivered the 
first septuplets in U.S. history. Although just three survived, the Frustacis 
said they were blessed and returned to Riverside. After the worldwide hoopla 
subsided, they sued the doctor who had administered fertility drugs (1984). 
</P>
<P>
CHILDREN AS PREY: 
</P>
<P>
It's called Caspers Wilderness Park, but no one took that literally until a 
young mountain lion sprang from the brush and carried away 5-year-old Laura 
Small. Laura, rescued almost immediately, was left partially paralyzed and 
blind in one eye. Seven months later, Justin Mellon, 6, was similarly attacked. 
The park was closed and a hunt begun. When the park reopened three months 
later, visitors were warned to stay with their children (1986). 
</P>
<P>
SURF RIOT: 
</P>
<P>
There were 100,000 people on the beach the final day of the Ocean Pacific Pro 
Surfing Championships in Huntington Beach when a group of beach-goers behind 
the grandstand became rowdy, then violent. Soon a full-scale riot was under 
way. By darkness, riot police had cleared the beach, but not before several 
police and lifeguard vehicles had been burned, more than 40 people injured and 
13 people arrested (1986). 
</P>
<P>
OLYMPIC FEVER: 
</P>
<P>
Lots of the excitement and some of the pageantry of the Los Angeles Olympics 
spilled over into Orange County. The biggest happening: bicycle races through 
Mission Viejo (1984). 
</P>
<P>
MISSING CHILD: 
</P>
<P>
Three-year-old Laura Bradbury of Huntington Beach disappeared from the family 
campsite at Joshua Tree National Monument, apparently a kidnap victim, touching 
off what grew into a nationwide search captained by her father (1984). Five 
years later, her family continued to deny the possibility of her death despite 
DNA tests showing bone fragments found near the campsite "were consistent with 
Laura Bradbury". 
</P>
<P>
MURDER MYSTERY: 
</P>
<P>
Edward Lee Cooperman, a Cal State Fullerton physicist, was found shot to death 
in his office. But why? A student, Vietnamese immigrant Minh Van Lam, said it 
had been an accident. Cooperman's friends said it had been an assassination 
prompted by Cooperman's humanitarian and scientific aid to Communist Vietnam. 
The judge scoffed at the assassination theory and convicted Lam of involuntary 
manslaughter (1984). 
</P>
<P>
MONEYGATE: 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, based in Irvine, spent five years on the financial 
fast track of junk bonds and high-risk real estate before federal regulators 
took it over (1989) and calculated that it could cost taxpayers $2 billion to 
bail it out. After Lincoln's collapse, Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of 
Lincoln's parent company, found himself the subject of congressional, civil and 
criminal investigations. Joining him on the hot seat were politicians whose 
favor he had cultivated -- including U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston of California. 
</P>
<P>
MUNIGATE: 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest judicial investigations in California focused on Harbor 
Municipal Court in Newport Beach, where six judges came under scrutiny (1989). 
In the end, Judge Brian R. Carter, suspected of exchanging courtroom favors for 
sex, retired rather than undergo a formal disciplinary hearing. Evidence 
included a taped conversation between Carter and a prostitute in which he 
stated, "This is the one you owe me." And Judge Calvin P. Schmidt was publicly 
rebuked for giving preferential treatment to a friend's daughter and making 
improper campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
GATESGATE: 
</P>
<P>
A jury heard weeks of allegations that Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates had 
used his investigators to harass political opponents by tape-recording their 
conversations and trumping up charges against them. Their verdict: Gates must 
pay $189,894 to the private investigator who filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
SECOND THOUGHTS: 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown, 14, confessed to murdering her stepmother and was sentenced to 
prison (1985). Case closed? Not quite. After three years in stir, she conceded 
to investigators that she had taken the rap for her father out of "love and 
loyalty." Officers arrested David Arnold Brown, an Anaheim Hills businessman, 
who they said took out $835,000 in life insurance on his wife, persuaded his 
daughter to confess to the murder, then married his dead wife's sister. Later, 
more charges were filed against Brown: trying, while in jail, to hire the 
murders of key prosecution figures. David Brown's trial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE II: 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Jean Ernst, 27, said she wanted only to lie down and asked her 
boyfriend to watch her 3-month-old twins napping outside in a car in Garden 
Grove. But by the time she checked on them five hours later, they were dead 
from the summer heat, estimated to have reached 120 degrees inside the car. 
Tried for involuntary manslaughter, she was convicted of child endangerment and 
sentenced to four years in prison. "It's not fair," she said to her attorney 
(1986). 
</P>
<P>
TRAGIC MISTAKE III: 
</P>
<P>
A Costa Mesa police helicopter, helping to pursue a suspect, passed the chase 
to a Newport Beach police helicopter as the suspect's car crossed over the city 
limit. But within seconds, the two helicopters collided and crashed. All three 
people aboard the Costa Mesa craft were killed. Miraculously, the two Newport 
officers survived (1987). 
</P>
<P>
DEADLY CLOUD: 
</P>
<P>
About 7,500 people fled their homes and jobs when an arsonist touched off a 
fire in an Anaheim pesticides and fertilizer warehouse (1985). More than 80 
chemicals, some of them lethal, were released over sections of Anaheim, 
Fullerton and Placentia. Only emergency workers were allowed in the area for 
four days. The owner of the warehouse, the Larry Fricker Co., later agreed to 
pay $200,000 for the cleanup. More than 300 claims were filed, alleging lost 
work time, respiratory infections and burdensome hotel, food and medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
HOME, v.EET HOME: 
</P>
<P>
The cost of houses, which began to spiral up in the '70s, went through the roof 
in the '80s. The average price of a house was about $150,000 at the start of 
the decade and was flirting with $400,000 at the end. 
</P>
<P>
NEAREST MISS: 
</P>
<P>
At John Wayne Airport, Air California Flight 336 tried to land on the runway 
where Air California Flight 931 was taking off, forcing 336's pilot to belly-in 
his Boeing 737 at the last second. The plane was mangled, but of the 104 
aboard, just 33 were injured, and no one was killed (1981). 
</P>
<P>
CHANGING FACE: 
</P>
<P>
The 1980 census put the county's minority population at about 22%, but a 
decade-long migration of Mexicans, Vietnamese and El Salvadorans raised the 
figure to an estimated 27%, and still climbing. 
</P>
<P>
TRAFFIC: 
</P>
<P>
It was a problem in 1980. It was a bigger problem in 1989. With two 
transportation taxes defeated, population still growing and cars still 
everyone's favorite wheels, there was no solution in sight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Newsmakers 
</P>
<P>
John Paul Bostrom, 13 months, and Eugenie Wilhelmina Bostrom, 2 weeks, went in 
for a medical checkup, the first step in events that eventually blew their 
secret: They were the out-of-wedlock children of family man and right-wing 
moralist John G. Schmitz, 51, once a congressman but then state senator from 
Corona del Mar. Their mother, Swedish-born Carla Stuckle, 43, had been one of 
Schmitz's students at Santa Ana College and a Republican volunteer. Stuckle 
said that Schmitz, married 28 years with seven children, eventually offered to 
pay $200 a month in child support but told her he couldn't pay more and still 
maintain his wife's life style (1981). 
</P>
<P>
Andrija Artukovic, frail from 85 years of living, was seized at his home in 
Surfside and ordered sent to Yugoslavia, becoming the highest-ranking Nazi war 
criminal ever extradited from the United States (1985). The Yugoslavs said that 
while Nazi interior minister of Croatia, Artukovic ordered entire town and 
village populations executed. Before a firing squad could carry out his 
sentence, Artukovic died of old age in a prison in Yugoslavia (1988). 
</P>
<P>
Mel C. Yorba, 17, of Riverside, became Disneyland's first murder victim (1981). 
</P>
<P>
W. Patrick Moriarty, an Anaheim fireworks manufacturer determined to prevent 
anti-fireworks laws, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to influence 
legislation. He wound up indicted and pleading guilty to bribing government 
officials and giving kickbacks to bankers (1985). Called one of the most 
significant political corruption cases in recent California history, the 
Moriarty affair led to indictment of city council members, bankers and one 
state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
David P. Jacobsen of Huntington Beach, a hospital administrator held hostage in 
Lebanon for 17 months, returned home to an outpouring of welcomes and 
patriotism. Released after U.S. arms shipments to Iran, Jacobsen praised Lt. 
Col. Oliver L. North as a hero, criticized news media probing of the 
transaction and at the White House tried to protect President Reagan from 
hostile questions by ordering reporters to "back off" (1986). 
</P>
<P>
Father Lawrence Jenco was also released by Lebanese terrorists after 19 months 
in captivity and was assigned by the Catholic Church to temporary duty in 
Orange County (1986). Asked what he thought of the arms shipment that freed 
him, the priest said: "I can't comprehend why we have to ship arms and kill 
innocent men, women and children. It doesn't make sense to me. . . . I would 
have said, 'No, I will stay.' " 
</P>
<P>
Sheryl Lynn Massip repeatedly tried to kill her 6-week-old son and finally 
succeeded by running over him with the family Volvo. Her attorneys said she 
suffered from postpartum psychosis, a rare maternal disorder that causes severe 
anxiety, delusions and sometimes violence. A jury convicted her of 
second-degree murder (1988), but the trial judge overturned the verdict. "I 
didn't have any choice but to find her insane," Superior Court Judge Robert R. 
Fitzgerald said. "She was bonkers." 
</P>
<P>
Wally, the 5 1/2-foot alligator who had lived in Upper Newport Bay for at least 
three years, was finally caught on a street in Irvine, much to the relief of 
local water birds. Too small for a zoo, Wally was sent to live in a 
herpetologist's private pond (1985). 
</P>
<P>
Roger R. Stanton, a Fountain Valley city councilman, launched an impossibly 
low-budget campaign against incumbent county supervisor Philip L. Anthony 
(1980) -- and won, apparently buoyed by Anthony's indictment for laundering 
campaign money. By decade's end, Stanton still firmly held the seat. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Razo Jr., 21 -- pride of the La Habra barrio, fund-raiser for cancer 
victims, Boys Club leader, youth award winner, star high school scholar and 
athlete, scholarship winner, above-average student and linebacker at Harvard -- 
</P>
<P>
was also La Habra's Ski Mask Bandit. Razo confessed (1987) to a string of armed 
robberies during vacation breaks from Harvard, saying "I'm a home boy now. At 
Harvard, I didn't fit in." He later recanted his confession but was convicted 
and sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Waisanen, former aide to TV evangelist Robert H. Schuller, blew the 
whistle on his old boss, revealing that fund-raising letters and photographs 
supposedly made during Schuller's trip to China had been faked months before 
Schuller departed. Schuller refused to comment, but his public relations 
spokesman, oblivious to the pun, called mailing the letters "a clerical error" 
(1987). 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Northwood Little League All-Stars, winning 18 straight playoff games 
-- 12 of them by shutouts -- became the national champion and America's hope of 
dislodging powerhouse Taiwan at the 1987 Little League World Series. Final 
score: Taiwan, 21, Northwood 1 -- the worst shellacking in the series' history. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the North Irvine Bobby Sox Minors won their second straight 
national softball championship (1987).

A gay couple were tossed out of Disneyland after caught dancing together on a 
dance floor (1980). The men filed suit, and five years later Disneyland quietly 
dropped its no-same-sex dancing rule. 
</P>
<P>
UP AGAINST THE WALL, BEAR: 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland's Winnie the Pooh was hauled into Superior Court by parents of a 
9-year-old girl who said Pooh had slugged their daughter at the park, causing 
$100,000 worth of bruises and headaches. In full costume, Winnie demonstrated 
that it had been an accident, nothing more than a smack from an ear when Pooh 
turned around. The jury deliberated 21 minutes and found the bear innocent 
(1980). 
</P>
<P>
UP AGAINST THE WALL, YOUR HONOR, WHENEVER IT'S CONVENIENT: 
</P>
<P>
Former Irvine Mayor Art Anthony beat his wife and nicked her with a bullet from 
a .45-caliber automatic pistol, sending her fleeing to the home of Police Chief 
Leo Peart. Peart, taking charge of the case, decided to let Anthony stay home 
that night, visited him twice the next day, allowed him to voluntarily check in 
to a psychiatric hospital and did not attempt an arrest for almost two days. 
Peart said later that moving too fast might have provoked a shoot-out (1981).

FOR ONE THING, THE RENT'S LOWER: 
</P>
<P>
Theodore Streleski, a Stanford mathematician who beat a professor to death with 
a hammer, chose to remain in prison rather than be paroled to Orange County. "I 
have nothing against Orange County," he said. "I understand it's got the best 
solid tax base in the state. But it's not my place." 
</P>
<P>
FREEWAY FEEDING FRENZY:

Bank robbers fleeing police tossed cash onto the Costa Mesa Freeway, touching 
off a scramble among motorists. Police caught up to the pair but found $1,200 
of the loot missing (1985).

GOOD CITIZEN AWARD: 
</P>
<P>
Deanna Young, 13, fresh from a lecture at church against drug abuse, turned in 
her parents to Tustin police for possessing about an ounce of cocaine and a 
small amount of marijuana (1986). Her parents, a bartender and a federal court 
clerk, later said they were proud of Deanna. Deanna said, "I'd do it again." 
</P>
<P>
KING OF THE JAILBIRDS: 
</P>
<P>
Willie Ray Wisely, convicted murderer and jailhouse lawyer supreme, set the 
record for longest stay in Orange County Jail -- more than seven years. Because 
he acted as his own attorney, he was provided with a private double cell, law 
books, a personal computer, a TV set, a telephone and a wife. (He secretly 
married his court-appointed law clerk during a jail visit.) Wisely was finally 
sent to Folsom Prison (1988) but continues to file motions occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
POLLGATE: 
</P>
<P>
Afraid that the Democrats would cheat, the Republicans got in the first punch. 
Blaming rumors that Democrats would truck illegal aliens to the polls, county 
Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes approved stationing uniformed security 
guards at polls in 20 mostly Latino precincts of Santa Ana (1988). County 
officials ordered them away and local Latinos filed lawsuits, but the 
Republican candidate, Curt Pringle, narrowly won his seat in Congress, and no 
one was charged. Eventually a bill was passed in Sacramento making uniformed or 
armed guards at the polls a felony, and local Republicans paid $400,000 to 
settle the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
WAIT, LET ME EXPLAIN: 
</P>
<P>
Irvine applied for federal funds to convert an animal shelter into housing for 
the homeless (1987). (The feds later withdrew their grant because planes taking 
off from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station came too close to the site.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hello... 
</P>
<P>
To car-pool lanes, appearing on the Costa Mesa Freeway (1985), spreading to the 
San Diego Freeway (1989) and prompting smiles or rage, depending on whether you 
were in one. 
</P>
<P>
To the Orange County Performing Arts Center, nurtured by land and money 
donations from C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons. Its opening (1986) ushered Orange 
County into the cultural big leagues, according to its promoters. 
</P>
<P>
To Rudy Castruita, who grew up in a Spanish-speaking home in El Monte, earned a 
doctorate at USC and became the first Latino superintendent of the Santa Ana 
Unified School District, the biggest in Orange County and eighth-largest in the 
state (1988). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goodby... 
</P>
<P>
To Edison Miller, Edmund G. Brown Jr., appointee to the Board of Supervisors, 
whose anti-war statements while a Vietnam POW made him anathema to 
conservatives. He was easily swept off the Board of Supervisors by Reagan 
Republican Bruce Nestande (1980). 
</P>
<P>
To the California Surf, who proved that Orange County wasn't ready for 
professional soccer (1981). 
</P>
<P>
To Richard Nixon, who moved out of San Clemente and became a New Yorker (1980). 
</P>
<P>
To John Briggs, Republican state senator from Fullerton for 15 years, who 
resigned with three years left in his term. He was bored, he said (1981). 
</P>
<P>
To Walter Knott, Orange County's most famous berry farmer, who died at age 91 
(1981). 
</P>
<P>
To James Myford Irvine, great-grandson of 19th-Century land baron James Irvine. 
He moved to Hawaii (1981). 
</P>
<P>
To Orange County International Raceway, the last drag strip in Southern 
California, lost to a business park development (1983). 
</P>
<P>
To affordable housing. Bowing to pressure from developers, the county 
supervisors scuttled its 5-year-old program that required builders to produce 
some lower-cost homes (1983). 
</P>
<P>
To C. David Baker's political career. So intent on bankrolling his campaign for 
a Republican congressional nomination, he forged the name of a Superior Court 
judge to a check and got caught (1988). 
</P>
<P>
To Ralph A. Diedrich, one-time baron of the Board of Supervisors. Imprisoned 
for bribery, defiant to the end, he died in San Diego (1988). 
</P>
<P>
To 44-year-old, barnstorming Meadowlark Airport in Huntington Beach, the last 
privately run airport in the Los Angeles and Orange County area (1989). Its 
successor: a shopping center and housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goodby Again (and Again and Again)... 
</P>
<P>
To the Huntington Beach Pier. A hurricane removed its end (1939), then winter 
storm waves did the same (1983 and 1988). As the '90s approached, Huntington 
Beach closed the remainder of the pier and announced plans to rebuild the whole 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
To the husbands of Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Rams. In the '80s, she 
married, then divorced musician/composer/convicted tax evader Dominic 
Frontiere, her seventh.

</P>
<P>
Hello and Goodby... 
</P>
<P>
To drug guru Timothy Leary. Hired to be host for a talk show on KEZY radio in 
Anaheim, he was fired within a week (1980). 
</P>
<P>
To trauma centers. Five opened and were praised for saving the most critically 
injured patients (1980), but high costs began thinning their ranks. Two are 
gone, and the future of the remaining three could be tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
To Jewel Plummer Cobb, appointed president of Cal State Fullerton, the first 
black woman to head a major university in the West (1981). Eight years later, 
she announced that she would retire, effective in July. 
</P>
<P>
To the Orange County Centennial. After a year of celebration, the county turned 
100 on Aug. 1, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hello and Goodby (Maybe)... 
</P>
<P>
To the scourge of fruit growers, the Mediterranean fruit fly. The first one, a 
sterile male, appeared in Buena Park (1981), making local authorities jittery. 
But after a pregnant female was found in Brea (1989), the county's first aerial 
pesticide spraying began.

<P>
Goodby and Hello... 
</P>
<P>
To Guy Snyder, 41, a Las Vegas hotel worker, who said he would sail round the 
world in 242 days and smash all sorts of records. He, his wife and his mother 
set out from Newport Harbor aboard We Made It, their 42-foot sailboat -- and 16 
days later made a U-turn for home, victims of seasickness (1980). 
</P>
<P>
To the Gay and Lesbian Student Education Union at Fullerton College. Rather 
than be forced by court order to recognize the group, the Board of Trustees 
withdrew recognition from all campus clubs (1980). The decision still stands, 
but G&amp;L eventually got onto campus by obtaining student government approval 
(1988). 
</P>
<P>
To Richard L. Fluharty, Eleazar Gonzales, Ly Hung, Michael D. Taylor and Steven 
Wilson, who checked out of Orange County Jail by rappelling four stories using 
a rope of knotted bedsheets (1988). One got no farther than a jail roof, one 
surrendered, two made it to Denver, and Taylor got as far as Chicago, where 
authorities believe he stuck up a jewelry store for $450,000 in loose gems. 
Within eight months, all were back in the slammer.

<P>
</P>
<P>
Hello and Shut up... 
</P>

To the Pacific Amphitheatre, which opened to the cheers of audiences and the 
howls of neighbors (1983). The neighborhood took its complaint about concert 
noise to court, where it remained unresolved as the decade ended.

STREET SMART: A TICKLISH ROUTE FROM DISNEYLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
For years there has been a major problem experienced by Disneyland visitors who 
wish to go north on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
After exiting the park and proceeding north on West Street, they must turn 
right onto Ball Road, then work their way over to the left-hand lanes so that, 
once they've crossed the freeway, they can make a left turn across the 
westbound lanes and onto the freeway entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans is building a new bridge where Ball Road crosses the freeway. It is my 
understanding that when this new bridge is completed, Disneyland visitors will 
still have to work their way over to the left lanes on this new bridge so they 
can make a left turn across traffic on Ball Road to reach the freeway entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Why would anyone spend millions of dollars on a new bridge without making 
provision to safely handle the many cars traveling east on Ball Road that would 
like to enter the northbound Santa Ana Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
Richard C. Martin 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
That freeway entrance is a doozy, the kind that makes motorists wish they were 
safely back on the Autopia in the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
But officials at Caltrans have a ready explanation for why they won't be 
eliminating the troublesome left turn on Ball Road. 
</P>
<P>
Given their druthers, the agency's highway engineers admit they would like to 
install a cloverleaf-type freeway entrance that would siphon eastbound traffic 
off Ball Road's right-hand lane and swing it on a curving strip of asphalt down 
onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway. No muss, no fuss and no left-hand turn. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the land needed for such a serpentine freeway ramp is occupied 
by a motel. Caltrans officials say the agency cannot justify purchasing the 
property and removing the motel just for a new freeway ramp. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they plan to do the next best thing. As part of the bridge 
construction, Caltrans will erect a new left-turn signal and add an extra 
left-turn lane off Ball Road onto the northbound Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the new turn lanes and traffic light, which will be 
synchronized with signals on nearby Harbor Boulevard, will help all those 
Mouseketeer groupies and Tinkerbell fans get onto the freeway a whole lot 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Like everyone in the Los Angeles Basin, I have become increasingly concerned 
with our traffic problems. The only solutions I see being offered appear to 
involve large sums of money and long-term projects. 
</P>
<P>
The solution is to reduce the number of vehicles on the road. The obvious 
answer is car-pooling. Unfortunately, most people give up on the idea because 
of the hassles involved in coordinating everyone. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to see local newspapers run advertising at no charge to commuters 
listing where people live and work, using the coordinates from a Thomas 
Brothers map book. This would provide a quick reference for people who live and 
work near one another and who have similar work schedules to form a car pool. 
</P>
<P>
Many large companies use a similar system for their employees. I am suggesting 
that this could be tried on an areawide basis. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written about the number of single-driver vehicles on the 
freeways. I think this plan could be a very logical way to reduce that number 
and speed up traffic on our freeway system, and it could be done with the least 
cost to the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas C. Moore 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
It's nice to see someone thinking about promoting car-pooling, which many 
transportation experts say is an important weapon in the battle to ease traffic 
congestion in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Those same experts, however, say that putting together such a commuter bulletin 
board in local newspapers might prove ineffective, since many residents are 
squeamish about public listings of their addresses and phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there is already a program to serve this purpose. It is called Commuter 
Computer, and it offers motorists information about others who live and work 
near them in an effort to encourage the formation of car pools. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested can call Commuter Computer at (714) 636-RIDE for information 
on car pools, van pools and the nearest park-and-ride lot. 
</P>
<P>
A very valid point. Seat belts save lives. Just ask any CHP officer or 
ambulance driver. Street Smart encourages motorists to use them, even if they 
sometime wrinkle your tie or blouse.

HOMICIDES SET RECORD IN COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From a 4-year-old boy slain in a hail of gang gunfire to a topless bar owner 
ambushed inside his limousine, a record number of people became homicide 
victims in Orange County during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The 155 killings recorded for the year by the Orange County coroner's office up 
to New Year's Eve, far surpassed the previous record of 131 homicides set in 
1985. The 1989 total easily topped the 129 slayings in 1988, 98 in 1987 and 112 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials studying the grim statistics say they cannot pinpoint 
any specific causes for the nearly 18% rise in the number of people who died at 
the hands of others in 1989. They can only note a general increase in violence 
in society and evidence that a growing number of people carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
"Homicides are just one of those things (for which) there are no explanations," 
Garden Grove Lt. Chuck Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is difficult to find a satisfying explanation for the death of 
4-year-old Frank Fernandez Jr., caught in the gang cross-fire in September as 
he stood in his family's driveway in Garden Grove. Or for the kidnap and murder 
of 9-year-old Nadia Puente of Santa Ana in March. Or for the slaying of 
12-year-old Jacalyn Calabrese, who was shot and killed in the Mall of Orange 
last month as a schoolmate showed off his .25-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
While many of last year's murders seem particularly senseless, others were 
carried out with the precision of a gangland murder. 
</P>
<P>
Horace Joseph McKenna -- known as "Big Mac" -- was shot through the rear 
passenger window of his limousine as it pulled up to the gate of his expansive 
estate in Brea's Carbon Canyon. McKenna, a former California Highway Patrol 
officer and a 6-foot, 6-inch bodybuilder, was under investigation for hidden 
ownership in several nude and topless bars at the time of his death. No arrests 
have been made. 
</P>
<P>
While no tally was available for each city, Anaheim appeared to have posted one 
of the largest increases in homicides. There were 28 killings in 1989, an 
increase of 10 over the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said that little changed in his city last year in 
terms of the provocation for homicide. Fights between family members and 
drunken brawls were again the most common situations that led to homicide in 
the county's most populous city. 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of the homicides we're investigating, the victim and suspect knew 
each other," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For all the concern and publicity about drugs and gangs, only four of the 
killings appeared to be directly linked to the narcotics trade, he said. And 
echoing the comments of police officials in other cities, Molloy added that 
gang activity accounts for relatively few killings around the county. 
</P>
<P>
While Anaheim, the Sheriff's Department and Santa Ana report an upswing in 
homicides, Garden Grove actually experienced a reduction. Gibbs said the city 
had four fewer homicides in 1989, recording eight as the year drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
But just as no one has a good answer for why the county's homicide rate surged 
last year, Gibbs is at a loss to explain the good news in his city. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been real fortunate," Gibbs said. "I don't know why. (There's) no way to 
track this stuff or predict it."

NUN WHO HELPED POOR IS DEAD AT 81 
</P>

<P>
Sister Henrietta Sauvageau, who spent more than 60 years ministering to the 
poor, the homeless, the addicted and the deaf in Orange County, has died at age 
81. 
</P>
<P>
Her fellow Sisters of St. Joseph described her as an irrepressible person to 
whom it was nearly impossible to say no. She had a knack for organizing and 
would go to great lengths to help anybody in need, other nuns said. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to say, 'I'm not going to go out with you any more, Sister Henrietta; 
you're a perfect beggar,' " recalled Sister Angela Lemay, 85, a friend from 
childhood. "But it was always for the poor, never for herself." 
</P>
<P>
Once Sister Henrietta learned that St. Joseph Hospital had purchased new 
mattresses, and she resolved to give the old ones to poor families. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'But how are you going to move the mattresses?' " Sister Angela said. 
"She said, 'Never you mind.' There was a circus in town, and somehow she got 
the men to help her." The mattresses were indeed delivered -- in a circus van. 
</P>
<P>
"She would get anything and everything from anybody," Sister Angela said. "You 
couldn't say no to Henrietta." 
</P>
<P>
Born Mathilde Sauvageau in 1908 in Manchester, N.H., she went to work in a shoe 
factory after completing the eighth grade. According to Sister Angela, who 
worked in the same factory, she gave most of her earnings to a local religious 
order, and on Saturday nights persuaded her friend to come with her to an 
orphanage, where they would put little girls' hair up for Sunday curls. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, she suffered from polio, and once confided that she had been told 
by a doctor that she would not walk again, Sister Rose Marie Redding said. "She 
said, 'Oh, yes I will. If God wills it, I will walk again.' She promised God: 
'I won't complain about my legs if I can walk again.' And even when her legs 
hurt her, she never did complain." 
</P>
<P>
After hearing about nuns who were ministering to homeless immigrants in Los 
Angeles, she came west and entered the Sisters of St. Joseph convent in Orange 
in 1927, taking her final vows in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Henrietta taught school in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego for 
about 15 years, and was stationed permanently in Orange in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
She began a home for women with alcohol or chemical dependency and founded 
programs for the hearing-impaired, Sister Rose Marie said. And in 1975, she 
volunteered to help the first Vietnamese refugees who arrived after the fall of 
Saigon and were sent to Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few years she had suffered from diabetes and had difficulty 
walking, but she got around in an electric cart, and "never missed a party," 
Sister Rose Marie said. Sister Henrietta continued to visit women in the 
dependency program until she suffered a stroke in early November. She died 
Saturday of kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
Sister Henrietta is survived by an older sister, Bertha Marston, who lives in 
the convent's infirmary, and by a stepsister, nieces, nephews and cousins. 
</P>
<P>
A Rosary prayer service will be held at 5 p.m. Thursday, followed by a Mass of 
the Resurrection at 7 p.m. in the Motherhouse Chapel, 480 S. Batavia St., 
Orange. Burial services will be at 9 a.m. Friday in the chapel, with burial in 
Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange.

RAMS PUT THEIR FOUL-WEATHER REPUTATION ON ICE WITH VICTORY

<P>
The cold, rainy weather for Sunday's wild-card game was supposed to favor the 
Eagles, who are accustomed to playing on the 100-yard slip-and-slide that is 
the Veterans Stadium artificial turf in a downpour. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the Eagles, not the Rams, who couldn't hang onto the football. The 
Rams fumbled once. Philadelphia fumbled six times. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams hope this will help put an end to their reputation as fair-weather 
football players. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could get (cornerback) Darryl Henley out from in front of the heater, 
we'd be all right," linebacker Mel Owens said. "He's the only guy who sits in 
front of the heater. 
</P>
<P>
"But, really, I'm from Michigan and believe me, nobody gets used to cold and 
rain. Nobody. I don't care who you are. Not even the birds. They seek shelter 
too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same for both teams. You put on a little sweat shirt and a little 
glove and you play football." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene was a little more succinct in his appraisal of the 
Rams' cold-weather rap. 
</P>
<P>
"Can the beach boys play in cold weather?" he asked, rather loudly, of the 
media mob crowded around his locker. "Well, can the beach boys play in cold 
weather?" he asked again, even louder. 
</P>
<P>
A number of reporters mumbled something akin to "yes," and Greene seemed 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams also hope they have dispelled another popular notion: that a team with 
a defense ranked 21st in the league has no business being in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the lowest-ranking defense in the playoffs and a lot of people said we 
didn't deserve to be here," linebacker Mike Wilcher said. "That gave us a lot 
of incentive today." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Greene took a more emotional tact on that subject. 
</P>
<P>
"Stiff all that, man," he said. "Play with your heart. It was a question of 
will today and we maintained that mentality. We had the desire and we kept 
fighting. And we had no lulls in the whole 15 rounds."

FIRING BACK AT EX-EMPLOYER; 
</P>
<P>
ATTORNEY DISCUSSES LAWSUITS OVER WRONGFUL TERMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gregory Crouch, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald Bott, 55, of San Clemente claimed he was terminated from his 17-year job 
as Santa Ana's director of personnel in 1983 because of his age and his efforts 
to expose wrongdoing in city hiring. Six months ago, a jury decided it didn't 
believe him. But last week, Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein said he did 
and overturned the jury's verdict, awarding Bott $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is a good example of the difficulties involved in proving a wrongful 
termination lawsuit. Courts and legislatures are providing an increasing amount 
of protection for employees from indiscriminate firings but many of the laws 
are complicated. Nearly all require anybody terminated to act quickly if he or 
she hopes to win a verdict against a former employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin attorney Harris E. Kershnar has represented more than 100 individuals 
who have sued their former employers for wrongful termination. He spent the 
early part of his career defending employers from such suits but changed sides 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm philosophically more comfortable representing the underdog," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kershnar, 36, now serves on the American Bar Assn.'s Equal Employment 
Opportunity Committee and is a former chairman of the labor law section of the 
Orange County Bar Assn. He graduated from the law school at UC Berkeley. He 
recently spoke with Times staff writer Gregory Crouch about how fired employees 
can vindicate themselves in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What types of wrongful termination cases have you typically argued? 
</P>
<P>
A. They are a varied lot. One was a case involving a large oil company that 
conducted searches of employees' vehicles and lockers as well as the employees 
themselves. The employee I represented was discharged because a marijuana 
cigarette was found in his car. The jury reached a verdict in favor of the 
employee on the grounds the employer violated an expressed agreement not to 
discharge people without good cause. Plus, there was an inadequate showing that 
the marijuana was his. And there wasn't much in the way of precedent to 
establish that drugs found inside a car amounted to grounds for terminating 
someone when there was no indication he had ever used drugs at work or ever 
reported to work under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
On a different subject altogether, I handled an age discrimination case against 
a trucking company where there was a manager who thought my client was too old 
to be a driver and didn't hesitate to communicate that in front of other 
employees. My client was fired for a minor driving accident, which would not 
have typically resulted in the termination of a driver. The case was settled on 
terms we thought were quite favorable. And I had a case where an employee was 
fired for refusing to fire somebody else who declined to take a lie detector 
test. It's illegal to require someone to take a lie detector test, and my 
client was told to fire an employee who exercised his right to decline such a 
test. My client told the president of the company it was illegal for him to 
fire this person and, in turn, my client was fired. My client won a verdict on 
the basis his firing was contrary to the public policy of the state of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How common is it for somebody to get fired? 
</P>
<P>
A. Exceedingly common. People who feel they have been improperly terminated 
call up virtually on a daily basis. Nearly everyone who is fired feels that it 
was improper or unfair, but the real question is how many have a legal remedy, 
because what's unfair does not equal what is unlawful. I don't have a 
percentage for you, but a small percent of the unfair terminations fall into 
categories where the law provides a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So what are the different categories? 
</P>
<P>
A. The primary area is in civil rights laws covering age, race, sex, religion, 
national origin and physical handicap. Firings based upon any of those 
categories is prohibited based upon the Fair Employment and Housing Act, which 
is a California statute. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is 
not prohibited by the terms of the acts but there are serval cities that have 
municipal ordinances that prohibit discrimination against gays and lesbians, 
including Laguna Beach, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if the reason for somebody's dismissal doesn't coincide with one of the 
civil rights classifications? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are a number of individual pigeonholes. It's illegal to fire someone 
because they have brought a wage claim before the labor commission. It's 
illegal to fire an employee for disclosing his wages to a fellow employee. You 
cannot be fired for reporting to state or federal authorities any illegalities 
that you plausibly believe are occuring at your employer. For example, if you 
think your employer is violating environmental laws by dumping petroleum 
products into sewers instead of disposing of them in a proper manner and your 
employer fired you for blowing the whistle on them, that would be unlawful. If 
you are fired because you attempt to organize a union, that is unlawful under 
the National Labor Relations Act. If you are fired by the company to try and 
deprive you of your pension, that is prohibited under the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act. Finally, if you are fired because you performed jury 
service when summoned, that is unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if you were simply fired without warning or good cause? 
</P>
<P>
A. The category most people fall under is that involving an expressed or 
implied employment contract which limits the employer's right to terminate. For 
instance, if an employer has a progressive discipline policy requiring warnings 
or other procedures prior to termination but does not follow that, an employee 
can bring a contract-based action for improper termination. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How can an employee find out whether his or her company has such a policy? 
</P>
<P>
A. Many employers issue employee handbooks which would contain such a policy. 
And if you're a supervisor you have probably received instruction from your 
employer as to the discipline of employees. If a policy is not in your employee 
handbook, ask your supervisor or the personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Besides what's contained in the employee handbook, are there other things a 
company does that imply a contractual relationship? 
</P>
<P>
A. Aside from written policy there is also the issue of actual practice. Even 
if there is not a piece of paper that says a company will follow progressive 
discipline but the way the employer disciplines employees amounts to a practice 
of progressive discipline, then employees are entitled to be treated in the 
same manner. There is an aspect of what's called the implied covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing which holds that like cases should be treated alike. For 
example, if employees who are tardy or absent are normally cautioned at least 
two times before being fired and a prospective client walks into my office and 
says he was absent once and was fired for that absence and there had been no 
other infractions committed by him, the employer would not be treating like 
cases alike. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about performance appraisals? 
</P>
<P>
A. Verbal and written communications by superiors are important. For example, 
if your boss told you that you had a bright future with the company and you 
bypass opportunities elsewhere, that would strengthen the claim for you based 
on an implied contract. Make sure performance appraisals are done because they 
will document whether you are or are not doing a good job and that is another 
factor looked at in implied contract cases. If you have a series of favorable 
evaluations and then all of a sudden you are told your performance warrants 
termination, that is not going to carry the day unless they can show some very 
specific misdeeds on the employee's part. The handbook, appraisals and length 
of service are all building blocks of an implied contract. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should an employee ask to see his personnel file if he smells trouble? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Every employee in California has a statutory right to inspect his 
personnel file and ought to exercise that right so the employee knows whether 
he or she has been written up. The employee should send a written response to 
the head of the personnel department and ask that a copy be placed in his 
personnel file while the incident is fresh in his mind and he has an 
opportunity to clear it up. Because employees come and go, it might be 
important for the employee to speak to other employees at the time this occurs 
because other employees' input may be critical to substantiating the employee's 
version of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are there some firings that cannot be challenged in court? 
</P>
<P>
A. If an employee was truly what is called "at will," that employee can be let 
go for no reason. Someone who is an at-will employee doesn't have a contract, 
implied or expressed. The United States is very unusual in that regard among 
Western nations. In Western Europe there typically must be some legitimate 
basis for termination. Otherwise, employees can obtain some monetary 
compensation. But in California, if an employee is truly at will and doesn't 
fall into any of the pigeonholes of the civil rights laws or specific statutory 
prohibitions, he can be fired because the employer wakes up on the wrong side 
of the bed. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Are at-will firings common? 
</P>
<P>
A. I screen out many more cases than I accept because the circumstance don't 
seem to be such that the law will provide a remedy. There are many times when 
people describe circumstances which strike me as unfair but they don't have any 
legal recourse. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How soon must a fired employee decide whether he will sue? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's important for individuals to act in a timely manner because even if you 
fall into a category where the law would permit relief, if you wait too long 
you lose your rights. The time frames for each statute vary but an employee 
should never let a full year lapse before proceeding against an employer. 
Ideally, you should act more promptly than that, while witnesses are available 
and recollections are fresh. Employment cases are almost always hard-fought. 
And employers typically have much greater resources than individuals. The 
typical plaintiff is by definition unemployed and suffering disastrous 
financial consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Can an employee with a medical condition be fired? 
</P>
<P>
A. When employees have been on a substantial medical leave because of a 
non-work-related condition which does not amount to a physical handicap, they 
can be fired. The man in the street feels it's grossly unfair, yet there is 
nothing unlawful about it. Take somebody who was seriously injured but not 
crippled in an automobile accident that wasn't work-related. The person is not 
considered handicapped in the strictest sense of the law because they don't 
have a permanent disabling condition. The employer might say you are fired 
because it won't wait until you are ready to come back and the employee has no 
recourse. The person may be entitled to state disability insurance but that 
doesn't force the employer to retain the employee. Those two are not tied 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much is the fired employee going to have to spend on legal fees? 
</P>
<P>
A. Typically employment attorneys, including me, handle cases on a contingency 
basis. And that's another reason why it's important for plaintiff practitioners 
to carefully evaluate cases. You can't make a living unless you win a fair 
percentage of the time. If there is a valid claim, I'm willing not to bill the 
client but take a contingency when and if we prevail. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there anything an employee can do to make a wrongful termination case 
airtight? 
</P>
<P>
A. The best thing to do if you can is to have an expressed contract, and almost 
the only time you will get that is when you are coming on board with a company 
because that is the honeymoon period when an employer wants someone with a 
specific skill or talent. Short of that, it's important for an employee to 
document any agreement or promises that an employer makes. Take a sales 
employee who is told verbally that if he reaches $150,000 in sales in a 
specific time period he will receive an extra 10% bonus. If I were that 
employee I would write a memo to that effect and send it to the person who sent 
it to me -- "In accordance with our discussion if I reach X dollars in sales I 
will be entitled to X percent extra commission." So as not to be too crass, 
because tact is always important, the employee might do that in the text of a 
memo about the extra sales efforts they intend to pursue to achieve the 
company's goal. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kind of employees realistically could get such an agreement? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think executives are the people who typically have an agreement of this 
type. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What should prospective employees look for in an employer? 
</P>
<P>
A. Employees considering joining a company should ask the personnel department 
to see a copy of the employee handbook and procedures. Carefully read what that 
employer says in its official documents regarding how it's prepared to treat 
its employees. Also, employees should be very wary of forms placed in front of 
them which may vary from what they have been told are the terms of their 
employment. For example, a manager recruiting an engineer from another 
aerospace company may make all sorts of promises regarding bonuses, career 
opportunities, et cetera, and yet the day they come on board they may have a 
document placed in front of them saying something like, "I am aware no one has 
authority to make any promises to me regarding length of employment and I can 
be terminated at any time for any reason." Six or seven months later, that 
employee is fired under circumstances which the employee believes to be 
unlawful and, lo and behold, the management lawyer takes out Exhibit 1, this 
preprinted form which says the employee can be fired any time for any reason 
and says "Didn't you sign this," and "Of course you read it and understood it, 
didn't you?" If you are asked to sign such a document, read it very carefully 
and scratch out anything that contradicts what has been promised you. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Should a fired employee accept severance pay if he is thinking of suing? 
</P>
<P>
A. Employers do not have a legal obligation to pay severance. The fired 
employee presented with a severance package needs to assess whether the money 
being offered is worth accepting in exchange for giving up your potential 
claims. The average employee would probably need to consult counsel to 
determine whether they had a claim and its likely worth compared to the 
severance package being offered. 
</P>
<P>
Q. If your case does go to trial, how much can you win in damages? 
</P>
<P>
A. That depends on the law the suit is based on. In an implied contract claim, 
punitive damages -- those designed to punish and deter similar treatment in the 
future -- are not available to you regardless of the outrageousness of the 
employer's conduct. You can get all out-of-pocket losses -- lost wages and lost 
benefits plus any catastrophic losses which flowed from the termination. For 
example, an employee out of work might lose his home because he can't make the 
mortgage payments. Emotional distress damages can also be pursued if such 
distress foreseeably resulted from the termination. Under the Fair Employment 
and Housing Act, you can get everything I just described plus punitive damages 
and attorney's fees. So if a person was sexually harassed at work and brought a 
claim under the FEHA, the remedies are potentially much greater than someone 
whose contract was breached.

ORIGINAL T.S.O.L. BAND'S REUNION SHOW PACKS NOSTALGIA, LACKS FOCUS

Steve Soto, who knows a few things about Orange County punk rock, sat in the 
upper rows of the Celebrity Theatre Friday night, surveying the house a few 
minutes before the original members of T.S.O.L. were about to go on stage 
together for the first time since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our high school reunion," said Soto, who was co-founder of Agent 
Orange and the Adolescents, two of the leading bands that came out of the 
Orange County punk rock explosion of 1979-80. Then Soto said something else: 
"There's money in punk-rock rehash." 
</P>
<P>
That pretty much explained why the show was taking place. And the high school 
reunion aspect had a lot to with why a near-capacity crowd (2,279 paid, 
according to promoter Gary Tovar of Goldenvoice Presents) had turned out to see 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Other bands from the Orange County punk wave wrote songs that were better and 
more melodic than the original T.S.O.L., and some groups had more staying 
power. But T.S.O.L. (True Sounds of Liberty) built a reputation as the most 
sensational, tempestuous and unpredictable live act of the local punk scene 
during the early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
The reunion brought out some younger fans who never had seen the band before -- 
like Christina Palmer, a 15-year-old from San Bernardino County who was 
scrounging change outside the theater before the show to raise the price of a 
ticket. She said that her interest in T.S.O.L. had been handed down from an 
older generation of punkers, an aunt and uncle now in their 20s and 30s. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Mora, a tall, hulking punk rock fan from Hollywood, said he used to go 
see the original T.S.O.L. in Los Angeles when he was barely in his teens. Mora, 
20, grumbled about how he could get in for as little as $1 to $5 in those days, 
compared to the $20 he had paid to see T.S.O.L.'s reunion. "For all the money 
they're getting, they'd better have a lot of energy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, T.S.O.L. had enough energy to get by, but not enough focus or 
group cohesiveness to infuse the show with much beyond nostalgia value. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Mike Roche (who came out wearing a top hat and red bandanna on his head 
and a skull mask on his face) kept up a fast, rumbling pulse along with drummer 
Todd Barnes, but the rhythm section only occasionally kicked the beat to a 
surging peak. 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Ron Emory generated the most musical excitement of the bunch, 
consistently churning out raw, slashing riffs and solos that often took on a 
charged rockabilly edge reminiscent of Billy Zoom's work during the punk heyday 
of X. Emory, now a member of Lunchbox, captured the roaring spirit of punk rock 
with his one lead vocal of the night, spitting out convincing scorn for 
authority during "Die for Me." Emory and lead singer Jack Grisham also raised 
some effective punk ire with their call-and-response screams on one thrashing 
number. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that was the only truly interactive moment of the 50-minute 
show. For the most part, Roche stayed in the background and Emory played in 
self-contained, if intense, solitude at stage right, leaving Grisham to caper 
about in his old role as T.S.O.L.'s ringleader and rabble rouser. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham alluded to the fact that the band hadn't played together in seven 
years, but there wasn't a flicker of warmth and sentiment between these old 
cronies. No smiles exchanged, no pinball-style physical contact between players 
(always helpful for a punk show), not even an introduction of the band members 
or a mutual bow at the end. 
</P>
<P>
The old personal animosities that split the band apart didn't surface, but the 
four T.S.O.L. alumni appeared only to have contrived a truce for business 
purposes, not a reconciliation born of rediscovered fondness for the good old 
days and each other. Still, this aloofness was better and more true to the 
take-us-as-we-are punk ethic than a feigned camaraderie would have been. 
</P>
<P>
The concert wound up being mainly a vehicle for Grisham, the big, lithe, 
naturally charismatic front man who spent the show moving about in graceful, 
loping strides. Grisham, who now leads the hard rock band Tender Fury, doesn't 
have an exceptionally rangy or powerful voice, but he hammed it up with the 
theatrical, half-crooned, half-spoken vocals that distinguished T.S.O.L. from 
its more snarling hard-core punk competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The 15 or so songs that T.S.O.L. performed all were drawn from the two EPs and 
two albums the original band released during its original run from 1980 to 
1983. One of the early T.S.O.L.'s virtues was its willingness to experiment 
with musical styles. The band changed with each recording, and that paid off in 
its reunion by allowing for a variety of tone -- a rarity among punk rockers. 
There were thrashing, politically oriented songs that railed at authority, the 
lighter, more melodic approach of the reggae-inflected "Word Is," the 
disgusting but funny necrophiliac fantasy of "Code Blue" and textured melodrama 
on songs like "The Triangle," with its spy story full of paranoia, and the 
stormily romantic "Wash Away." Most of the songs came off as grist for 
Grisham's performance, rather than as deeply felt expression in which the song 
itself mattered more than the singer. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham has said he got into punk rock as a teen-ager because he saw it as an 
outlet for his adolescent delight in all-purpose hell-raising. His instigator's 
streak surfaced at the Celebrity, as he egged on an already tumultuous crowd to 
leap over a wooden barrier and on to the stage. The many who tried didn't fare 
very well: a cordon of linebacker-size security men would grasp each would-be 
stage crasher in a bear hug and hustle the intruder out of the auditorium. But 
if the aim of singer and audience was to recreate the tumult of the good old 
days of punk, they pretty much succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
(Whether out of savvy, instinct, or blind luck, Grisham picked just the right 
moment to stall the show and let emotions subside at the point when the 
turbulence in front of the stage threatened to get out of hand. He did so by 
taking off his shoes and promising to perform naked. But Grisham, stripped to 
the waist through most of the show, managed to keep his leather tights and 
codpiece in place for the remainder of the concert). 
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise of the show was Grisham's announcement from the stage that 
what was to have been a one-time reunion will have a sequel Tuesday night at 
Raji's nightclub in Hollywood. That show will be recorded for a live album 
(Peter Heur, president of Triple X Records, said the second show was arranged 
to avoid a $2,500 fee that the Celebrity Theatre required to record Friday 
night's concert). 
</P>
<P>
The decision to do a live album, which Heur said will be a joint release by 
Triple X and Enigma Records, will have consequences for Mike Roche. Until now, 
Roche had been the last original member of T.S.O.L. still playing with the 
second-generation version of T.S.O.L., which has continued to tour and record 
since 1984 while phasing out punk music in favor of a blues-rock and 
heavy-metal slant. Roche's partners in the current T.S.O.L., Joe Wood and Mitch 
Dean, had consented to his playing Friday's reunion only after much internal 
haggling that threatened to split the band. The current members said they 
aren't going to stand for Roche taking part in a reunion album as well, and 
Roche said in a post-show interview that he is being ousted from T.S.O.L. as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
"They said if I do this record I'm out of the band," Roche said. "I'm doing the 
show (at Raji's). If it is so bitter and they want to replace me, I don't want 
to play with them any more. We can't keep riding the merry-go-round." Roche 
said he is considering legal action either to prevent Wood and Dean from 
continuing to use the name T.S.O.L., or to gain financial compensation for use 
of the name he says he originated. 
</P>
<P>
Wood confirmed Saturday that the current T.S.O.L. was planning to perform 
Saturday night in Montclair with a new bass player, Dave Mello. "I have the 
ideal band. I'm happy," Wood said, dismissing the notion that Roche has more 
claim to the T.S.O.L. name than he and Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Wood has maintained that Roche's personal problems, more than the tension over 
the original T.S.O.L.'s reunion, have undermined Roche's position in the band. 
"If Mike gets his (stuff) together, he's welcome back (in the current 
T.S.O.L.). He needs to get his priorities lined up."

EARLY EXHIBITS TO DISPLAY CONTEMPORARY LOOK

<P>
Well, out with the old year, in with the new. What's coming up on the visual 
arts scene in Orange County? Happily, some impressive-sounding shows -- nearly 
all devoted to contemporary work -- are on tap for the first six months of 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
One important point to keep in mind: While it's great for our museums and 
galleries to host fine shows organized elsewhere, an institution's real 
prestige comes from having done the planning, thinking and legwork on its own. 
</P>
<P>
Newport's first big blast for the year opens April 8. "OBJECTives: THE NEW 
SCULPTURE," (through June 24) is chief curator Paul Schimmel's last project 
before he leaves for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. The show 
presents a type of work by younger American and European artists that has come 
to dominate the offerings of a number of major galleries in L.A., New York and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Neo-Geo" or "Simulationism" in the United States, this work is about 
our attitudes toward everyday objects and the way they reflect assumptions held 
by the society that produced them. 
</P>
<P>
Without knowing these works were created by artists and meant to carry a 
particular set of meanings, viewers are likely to see such pieces merely as 
mass-produced kitsch, a bizarre kind of window dressing or the whims of an 
eccentric collector. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, work such as this cries out for explication -- a task that a museum 
survey is equipped to undertake. Artists in the show include the much-lauded, 
much-derided Jeff Koons as well as Grenville Davey, Katharina Fritsch, Annette 
Lemieux, Julian Opie, Haim Steinbach and Robert Gober. Financial support comes 
from the Irvine Co. and the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
Associate curator Lucinda Barnes' first show at Newport Harbor is also the 
first one-person exhibition of Buzz Spector's art in California (Jan. 21 
through March 18). An art critic and former book designer, Spector transforms 
books "from object(s) of communication into . . . object(s) of the 
imagination," as a Museum of Modern Art curator has written. Part of the 
ongoing New California Artist series, the exhibit -- supported by the museum's 
Century Club -- presents several of the artist's "altered books" (created by 
tearing or carving) and one of his sculptural installations, made with 6,500 
stacked volumes. 
</P>
<P>
Although an exhibit called "Selections from the Permanent Collection" (Jan. 21 
through March 18) sounds like old news, Newport's includes some significant 
recent additions. One is "Rondo," an installation by celebrated "light and 
space" artist James Turrell, purchased with funds from the Peter Norton Family 
Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum's big contender -- the pet project of director Charles 
Desmarais -- is "The Profound in the Banal: The Art of Ilene Segalove" (April 
27 through July 8). The Los Angeles artist is well known for her deadpan 
videotapes exploring the amazing-but-true blend of blandness and weirdness 
experienced by middle-class suburbanite living in a consumer culture. 
</P>
<P>
The show -- funded in part by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts 
-- will include 30 large-scale photographic works, 12 videotapes and 20 audio 
works. (Viewers may already have heard some of Segalove's audio pieces on 
National Public Radio's "All Things Considered" and "Morning Edition.") 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Art Museum's South Coast Plaza Satellite site starts the new year 
with a group of installations by San Francisco artist Paul Kos (Jan. 11 through 
April 15). His new piece, "Ber lin" -- the title is divided to represent the 
Berlin Wall -- incorporates neon, lights, two-by-fours and cuckoo clocks as 
metaphors for recent political upheaval in the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
Kos' other work in the show includes a couple of recent pieces -- "Silenced 
Tongues" and "Trotsky" -- as well as "rEVOLUTION: Notes for the Invasion -- mar 
mar march" from 1973, in which the rat-a-tat-tat of a typewriter stuttering 
over the same word creates a hypnotic, marchlike cadence. 
</P>
<P>
How brave of South Coast Plaza, which is bearing some of the costs of the show, 
to have opened its pocketbook for such subversive-sounding stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Other exhibits are imports from points east and north. 
</P>
<P>
"Success Is a Job in New York ... The Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol" 
runs from Jan 21 through March 18 at Newport Harbor, where is also is funded by 
South Coast Plaza. Organized by the Grey Art Gallery and Study Center at New 
York University, the show traces the artist's early commercial and 
non-commercial art, before he became a big shot in the Pop world. 
</P>
<P>
In 1959 Warhol came to New York from Pittsburgh, a 21-year-old with a design 
degree from Carnegie Tech. His early jobs were with ad agencies, fashion 
magazines and department stores. (The show's title comes from a magazine 
article Warhol illustrated.) A few years later he was hired to design book 
jackets and record albums, and he dabbled in "image shaping" for retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
Only in 1957 did he give up commercial stints to focus on his own art -- which 
was, of course, derived from the look of advertisements and throwaway media 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
"Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper 1951-1989," which runs July 13 through Oct. 7 at the 
main location of the Laguna Art Museum, was organized by the University Art 
Museum, Berkeley. DeFeo, who died in November at 60, showed at the Ferus 
Gallery in Los Angeles and was included in the prestigious "Sixteen Americans" 
show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1959. One of the few women 
painters of her era to hold her own with the big boys of the art world, she 
worked in both figurative and abstract modes. 
</P>
<P>
This exhibit -- funded by the Exhibitionists, a Laguna Art Museum council -- 
includes drawings, photo collages and paintings on paper. 
</P>
<P>
For the die-hard lovers of California Impressionism, Laguna is trotting out 
"Colors and Impressions: The Early Work of E. Charlton Fortune" on Feb. 2 
(through April 15). Fortune was one of the handful of women (the "E" stood for 
Euphemia) among the painters who introduced the French style so belatedly to 
California in the 'teens of this century. Originated by the Monterey Peninsula 
Museum of Art, the exhibit is supported in Laguna Beach by 
Wittenberg/Livingston Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The non-commercial galleries also have come up with a bunch of shows that sound 
well worth checking out: 
</P>
<P>
"John Paul Jones: The Man in the Mirror: The Constant Image" opens Jan. 9 at 
the Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna Beach (through Feb. 20). 
Phyllis Lutjeans, guest curator for the show, says it is not a real 
retrospective; instead, as she modestly says, it's based on "a funky idea I 
had." The exhibit includes about 40 works made by the UC Irvine art faculty 
member from 1948 to 1989. Lutjeans believes the somewhat murky, amorphous 
figurative images in Jones' early paintings and works on paper are strongly 
related to the sculptures he has been making recently, in which viewers can see 
reflections of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The redoubtably titled "California Collectors and Collections II: The Arts and 
Crafts Movement in California 1900-1918: Traditions and Antecedents" opens Feb. 
6 and runs through May 26 at the Center for the Study of Decorative Arts in San 
Juan Capistrano. This movement -- led by English poet-artist-craftsman William 
Morris -- was a revolt against the lack of quality and overdone embellishment 
in machine-made Victorian furnishings. As Morris once said: "Have nothing in 
your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
In California, the Arts and Crafts spirit involved the use of restrained 
designs and lavish use of natural woods, metals and minerals. It was kept alive 
by such true believers as Greene &amp; Greene, the Pasadena architecture firm; 
furniture maker Gustav Stickley; and Dirk van Erp, a San Francisco lamp maker. 
Their influences will be visible in this exhibit of furniture, ceramics, 
metalwork, lamps and textiles, including period rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Only sparse information was available last week about upcoming offerings at 
Saddleback College Art Gallery in Mission Viejo, but they include "Leningrad 
Artists," Feb. 8 through March 9, recent work by painters who broke away from 
the officially sanctioned styles and subjects of art in the U.S.S.R. The 
exhibit is curated by Selma Holo of the Fischer Gallery at the University of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Coming up Jan. 7 (through Feb. 10) at the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery is "The 
Pleasure and the Terror: An Exhibition of Landscapes," works by Los Angeles 
artists Richard Sedivy and Lynn Aldrich. He does mixed-media constructions on 
canvas; her works are free-standing painted sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
Sedivy is a popular guy in these parts: His paintings also can be seen in 
"Insistent Landscapes" at Security Pacific Gallery in Costa Mesa. Opening Feb. 
3 (through April 1), the exhibit includes paintings by Lawrence Gipe (whose 
work was at the Laguna museum a couple of years ago), Tobi Kahn, Marcia Cygli 
King, Vicki Teague-Cooper and Jean Towgood. For that matter, work by Annette 
Lemieux (shown concurrently in Newport Harbor's "OBJECTives") makes another 
appearance in a Security Pacific show provisionally called "Representational 
and Non-Representational Strategies" (April 21 to June 3), along with Moira 
Dryer, David French, Jim Iserman, Ronald Jones, Lari Pittman, Rosemarie Trockel 
and Sohki Wagner. Meanwhile, the gallery's Project Room gets a mysterious new 
tenant: an installation by Los Angeles artist Michael McMillen called "Train of 
Thought" (Feb. 3 through July 29). 
</P>
<P>
Art, architecture and music are the topics of several hot-ticket lectures and 
lecture series this winter and spring at the museums. 
</P>
<P>
Francoise Gilot, an artist who was Pablo Picasso's mistress in the late '40s 
and early '50s speaks on "Cocteau as I Knew Him 1944-1963" at the Severin 
Wunderman Museum in Irvine on Jan. 20 at 4 p.m. Picasso introduced Gilot to 
author and artist Jean Cocteau, and they remained friends until his death in 
1963. The museum is at 3 Mason St. Ticket prices are $20 general, $12 seniors 
and students with ID. For more information and reservations, call (714) 
472-1138. 
</P>
<P>
"California and Beyond: The State of Design in the '90s," a five-part lecture 
series, begins Feb. 7 at Beckman Center on the UC Irvine campus. Sponsored by 
Newport Harbor Art Museum, the series includes talks by architect Michael 
Graves (Feb. 7), landscape architect George Hargreaves (Feb. 28), architect 
Steven Holl (March 14), graphic designer April Grieman (March 28) and architect 
Frank Israel (April 11). 
</P>
<P>
Supported by The Western Regional Philanthropic Committee of Shearson Lehman 
Hutton Inc. and the Shearson Lehman Hutton Mortgage Corp., the series is a

THE MARSHAL OF CONTROVERSY; 
</P>
<P>
TOUCHED BY A SCANDAL, SEN. JOHN GLENN WILL STILL BE AN ASTRONAUT-HERO TO MANY 
WHEN LEADING TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE 
</P>

<P>
It has been a bit of a sticky wicket, conceded Tournament of Roses president 
Don Fedde -- "We don't like controversy more than anybody else. Let's put it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
But here was Fedde, a genial 52-year-old furniture store owner who has served 
the tournament faithfully for 25 years, finally getting his shot at the top job 
and with it the honor of choosing the grand marshal for today's Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
And, bingo, controversy. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 12, with flair and flourishes, former astronaut John H. Glenn, now a U. 
S. senator from Ohio, was announced as grand marshal for today's 101st 
Tournament of Roses parade. Announcing his choice, Fedde had praised Glenn as 
"a hero with steely nerves and harmonious hometown values. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 13, in what Fedde understatedly describes as an "unfortunate" bit of 
timing, the Common Cause citizens' lobby called for investigations of five 
senators, including Glenn and California's Alan Cranston, on charges they 
improperly interfered with a federal investigation of now-bankrupt Lincoln 
Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Ethics Committee announced 2 1/2 weeks ago that it was beginning a 
preliminary investigation to determine whether the five had abused their 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn's integrity, heretofore untarnished, is being questioned, the key issue 
being whether Lincoln owner Charles Keating bought Glenn's influence with a 
$200,000 contribution to a political action committee controlled by the Ohio 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
"On selection day, we had thought it was the greatest (pick) we could have 
made," Fedde said, adding that Glenn had been a noncontroversial choice for 
grand marshal, a standout among the dozen or so finalists that included 
musicians, actors -- and former Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the committee was left to wonder if its hero might have feet of clay. 
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that there was never any serious thought given to uninviting 
Glenn. "We couldn't find any basis," he said. "There's nothing but innuendo. 
The innuendo has been very heavy, admittedly. But we think we know all the 
facts." 
</P>
<P>
As the "Keating 5" scandal grew, Fedde made it his business to learn everything 
he could about it. "I read every article, taped every program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
From Washington, Fedde obtained a copy of the transcript of the meeting that 
took place in April, 1987, with the five senators and federal thrift 
regulators, a meeting called at the urging of Charles Keating. 
</P>
<P>
From Glenn, he got a copy of an eight-page statement the senator wrote around 
Thanksgiving, explaining what he did and did not do, and concluding: "My life 
has been, and remains, an open book. . . . It's been a life based on decency, 
honor, integrity and the highest ethical standards. I have not changed, and 
with every fiber in my being, I resent anyone implying otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Never, Fedde said, was there one terrible moment of crisis when the 
tournament's nine-man executive committee sat down and asked themselves, "What 
do we do now?" It was more a matter of worrying about how big this thing was 
going to get and how soon. 
</P>
<P>
Although they continued to read about the savings and loan scandal and Glenn, 
Fedde said, "We have looked into it deeply and we feel his conscience is clear, 
and we think time will prove our decision to be the right one to proceed with 
him. . . . He is a national hero and we still consider him so. . . . We just 
want to honor a space pioneer." 
</P>
<P>
Sure, some may be critical of the tournament's choice for grand marshal, Fedde 
shrugged. Last year, the honor went to Shirley Temple Black, hardly a wildly 
controversial figure, and, he said, "We even got letters on her." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Glenn, for his part, appeared to be enjoying himself enormously as 
he dutifully worked his way through three days of formalities leading up to the 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Friday morning, shortly after returning from a jog, he said he 
wasn't worried about the Keating scandal -- "Not at all. That'll all come out 
all right. I'm not concerned." Everything will be OK, he added, when "what I 
did not do comes out." 
</P>
<P>
Had he at any time considered withdrawing as grand marshal? "No, not at all. I 
had no reason to step down. . . . If people have been misled by the media, 
well, I'm sorry about that. But I know the American people to be very fair." 
</P>
<P>
For the long haul, Glenn said, he is not concerned. In the short run, he 
acknowledged, his implication in the Keating affair, is "very irritating." 
</P>
<P>
As for the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game, "We've watched every year on TV," he 
said. "Of course, I'd hoped maybe Ohio State (not Michigan) might be here. I 
guess we're character-building this year." 
</P>
<P>
The entire Glenn family will be on hand. Annie, his wife, will ride with him. 
In the stands will be their son, Dr. David Glenn, an anesthesiologist in San 
Francisco, his wife, Karen, and their sons, Daniel, 7, and Zachary, 5, as well 
as the Glenns' daughter, Lyn, who lives in St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn hopes to get some good film along the route with his new hand-held 
camcorder. 
</P>
<P>
There is no indication that he intends to let the cloud of scandal rain on his 
parade. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking forward to it," he said. "I'm really getting a big kick out of 
it. It's a great honor." 
</P>
<P>
At his first official appearance as grand marshal, at the annual Kiwanis 
kickoff luncheon Friday at The Pasadena Center, the reception Glenn received 
indicated that, in the eyes of the public, he is still the bona fide hero who 
became the first American to orbit the globe in the little Friendship 7 
capsule, one February morning 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As he was introduced by Fedde as "the perfect person" to lead this year's 
parade, Glenn -- the World War II bomber pilot, Korean War fighter pilot and a 
test pilot who once set a transcontinental speed record -- received a steady 
round of applause, building to a crescendo, then to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
He responsed with a patriotic pep talk, in which he spoke of "walls tumbling 
down" and "dictators tumbling down" throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
A fit and youthful-looking 68, Glenn, who became a multimillionaire through 
investments in hotels and who briefly was a Democratic Presidential candidate, 
breezed through a Saturday morning of television interviews at Tournament House 
in Pasadena. He described for one interviewer how weightlessness in space 
feels, talked about the California sunshine and the bitter cold back home in 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Fedde seemed well pleased. Everything seemed harmonious, nicely in keeping with 
this year's parade theme, "A World of Harmony." 
</P>
<P>
That theme had proved to be an inspired choice this particular year, although, 
Fedde acknowledged, "What we had in mind was the wonderful Reagan-Gorbachev 
relationship. How were we to know about these incredible world events?" 
</P>
<P>
Still, the accolades for omniscience were music to his ears in a year when 
tournament-bashing appeared to be in vogue. Although there have been reports 
that parade and game tickets were all but going begging, not so, Fedde said. 
Sales, he said, were only "minutely off." 
</P>
<P>
And there were the critics asking, once again, if it is moral to spend hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to build pretty floats when there are thousands of 
people hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always an anti-Establishment element," Fedde said, observing that the 
festivities are more than "just a party," that $10 million in television 
revenues are divided among the 20 Big 10 and Pac 10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, he observed, "on a cost per impression basis, (a float) is one of the 
best bargains in the world" for corporate America. It's advertising, PR, so 
"why not say it in a joyous, beautiful way?" 
</P>
<P>
He was more concerned about glitches that could arise, even after 18 months of 
planning. What was going to happen to the people who traditionally park on the 
other side of the arroyo and walk over Colorado Bridge? The bridge has been 
closed as unsafe but, he knows, "they're not going to be aware of it until New 
Year's morning." 
</P>
<P>
A giant robot, the parade entry from General Motors-United Auto Workers, had 
been a potential troublemaker, 40 feet wide (that's 22 feet over what's 
allowed). The committee worked that one out. Said Fedde, "We've put the arms on 
separate circuits so one arm can go down when the other one comes up." 
</P>
<P>
The committee, he said, had been very, very busy dealing with requests for 
exceptions to size limits: "We don't want the parade to be a size race, a 
budget race or a horsepower race." 
</P>
<P>
Fedde had just received a memo from one of his staff with the information that 
the lead car in this year's parade, a 1952 Chrysler Imperial Phaeton limousine, 
was the very car that appeared in the 1984 film, "The Right Stuff," carrying 
actor Ed Harris as astronaut Glenn in the tumultuous New York ticker tape 
parade in his honor in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
(Glenn greeted this news with his opinion that the whole film should have been 
left on the cutting room floor). 
</P>
<P>
It was all about to happen. Horses, parades, floats. 
</P>
<P>
And an embattled American hero as grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
Fedde emphasized that all of his opinions on the Glenn matter were just that, 
his opinions, adding, "Nothing in this world is absolutely certain. We're 
running on faith, and that's all you can do."

ERA ENDS AS JONES EXITS TOP POST AT NORTHROP CORP.; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: IN HIS 30 YEARS AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE HE LED THE COMPANY FROM RELATIVE 
OBSCURITY TO A PLACE AS A MAJOR MILITARY PRIME CONTRACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The last of the aerospace industry Titans, the men who became synonymous with 
their corporations and the aircraft they produced, is gone with the departure 
of Thomas V. Jones as chief executive of Northrop Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who at Northrop's helm for 30 years came to personify the maverick 
aerospace company and who survived an astonishing succession of personal 
controversies, will remain its chairman but will retire today as an employee of 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the aerospace industry has rushed to give Jones several major 
awards for his career accomplishments, adding to the long list of recognitions 
that he has received as an aviation leader. The City of Hawthorne even named a 
park for him. 
</P>
<P>
But Jones is stepping down from his post with the company still under 
indictment on criminal charges and facing several investigations by federal 
grand juries in Los Angeles and elsewhere. And although he undoubtedly built 
Northrop into a leading prime contractor, the success of his legacy depends on 
the outcome of several risky programs. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't make them like Jones anymore," said Paine Webber aerospace analyst 
Joseph Campbell. "Jones is the last of the old guard. It is the passing of an 
era -- rightfully so." 
</P>
<P>
Jones declined to be interviewed for this story. A Northrop spokesman said 
Jones was so busy that he had no time to talk. 
</P>
<P>
Jones came from a time when aerospace chiefs made gutsy big gambles on new 
technology, and Jones made some of the biggest wagers in history. He bet $1.2 
billion of shareholder money on the F-20 jet fighter during the 1980s and 
failed to sell one. But he also gambled big on the B-2 Stealth bomber program 
and turned the industry on its ear by winning. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he transformed a relatively small and flagging aerospace 
company in the late 1950s into one of the major military prime contractors in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"He took Northrop to a commanding position, at least technologically and in the 
engineering systems to exploit that technology," said Prudential-Bache analyst 
Paul Nisbet. "He has been a strong factor in bringing the company to where it 
is, though there is divided opinion over exactly where that is." 
</P>
<P>
Jones is leaving with the company deeply in debt and with a market value of 
just $823 million, less than what two of his Stealth bombers cost. Northrop is 
teetering on the edge of tremendous success or virtual extinction, depending on 
the outcome of the B-2 and the advanced tactical fighter, or ATF, programs. 
</P>
<P>
However those programs fare, Jones was a driving force behind the development 
of the F-5 jet fighter, the T-38 Air Force trainer and the Navy YF-17, which 
became the basis for the current F-18 jet fighter. 
</P>
<P>
"He should be remembered as an enormously effective pioneer of new airplanes," 
said Thomas O. Paine, a former Northrop president. "He has an incredibly 
powerful personal determination to succeed against all odds." 
</P>
<P>
But Jones had another side to his personality -- a penchant for bold acts that 
often carried an unnecessary risk, according to another former colleague. 
</P>
<P>
"Jones brings to mind that statement from Adm. Arleigh Burke: 'Give me a strong 
ship, for I intend to sail into harm's way.' Well, Tom liked to sail into 
harm's way," the former colleague said. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom gets a big kick out of getting into trouble and then getting out," he 
added. "It is ingrained in his personality." 
</P>
<P>
Jones got into more trouble and survived more often than probably any 
contemporary aerospace executive. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, Jones signed a consent agreement with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission in which he promised not to bribe any foreign officials. That was 
after the company had allegedly paid out $30 million to foreign officials in 
connection with international arms deals. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop, under Jones, became the consummate international arms merchant, 
selling its F-5 jet fighter to nations from Norway to Saudi Arabia. Jones 
became close to the Shah of Iran and at one time proudly displayed a Persian 
rug at the company headquarters that was a gift from the Shah. 
</P>
<P>
Jones also pleaded guilty to a federal felony count during the Watergate 
scandal in which he admitted to falsifying documents involving political 
contributions that were linked to a Richard Nixon slush fund. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath, Jones agreed to form a board of directors that was 
constituted almost entirely of outsiders. But that board eventually became a 
source of support for him, backing such risky Jones ventures as the F-20, ATF 
and B-2. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much more you can accomplish," said William Ballhaus, a board 
member who has known Jones throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. J. Long, another board member, said Jones "made some significant 
contributions to the whole aerospace industry." 
</P>
<P>
But Ballhaus and Long sought to dispel any doubt that Kent Kresa, the president 
and new chief executive, is in full control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Jones' precise role will be determined by (Kresa)," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballhaus said: "It is a transition from the Jones era and it will now be the 
Kresa era. As a non-employee, Jones is free to go sail a boat. I am sure he 
will not be there (at his office) every day." 
</P>
<P>
The Kresa era will also begin with a substantially new slate of top executives. 
Since the start of 1989, eight of Northrop's 22 elected corporate officers, 
many of whom were Jones cronies, have left. Most recently, Northrop general 
counsel William M. Elliott quietly departed the company at a time of legal 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
The company is facing probes by federal grand juries in Texas, Hawaii and 
California. One inquiry is into whether $7.75 million in payments to Koreans 
violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company was also indicted 
on federal charges of criminal fraud earlier this year in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all these problems, Jones' departure was not forced on him, according 
to knowledgeable sources. 
</P>
<P>
A former Northrop executive said: "It was a situation where Jones himself 
recognized it was time to leave. There were people in Washington, in the Air 
Force and at the Pentagon, who let it be known that they would not be unhappy 
if he retired."

</P>
<P>
MERCENARIES: MIKE HARARI ONCE WORKED FOR MOSSAD. BUT HE BECAME THE PANAMA 
STRONGMAN'S RIGHT-HAND MAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

JERUSALEM 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The news proved false, but a report last week that Mike Harari, an Israeli 
mercenary and right-hand man to deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega, 
was under arrest caused brief anxiety among government officials here. 
</P>
<P>
Harari is a former agent in the Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, who 
gained prominence as a figure in business and arms dealings between Israel and 
Panama, of which he was reported to take hefty commissions. Harari also trained 
anti-terrorist and private security squads for Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats in Panama and American congressmen have warned Israel on 
several occasions that if Noriega and Washington collided, Harari could prove 
to be an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Before word arrived that U.S. troops had in fact not detained Harari, officials 
here had already moved to disown him. Whatever he was doing, he was doing it on 
his own, they insisted. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a private citizen. As far as I know, he has no connection with the 
government of Israel," said Yosef Amihud, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Harari say that he is in Israel, Israel Radio reported last week. 
It is not yet clear whether Harari would face charges in Panama if he were 
captured. 
</P>
<P>
Harari, 62, is the second prominent Israeli whose tangled relationships with 
suspected Latin American drug dealers made Israel blush last year. Officials in 
Colombia accused Yair Klein, a retired army colonel, of training killers on 
behalf of cocaine smugglers. Klein said he was training cattle ranchers to 
defend themselves against terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
The Harari and Klein cases had another common thread: Both men evidently traded 
on skills that have limited marketability in their home country, once their 
official services ended. There are more than 800 Israeli companies that export 
anti-terrorist, paramilitary and security training overseas; most are manned by 
former soldiers and intelligence agents. 
</P>
<P>
Harari's long career with the Mossad included some of the agency's most deadly 
missions. He headed a force of "hit squads" to kill Palestinian terrorists in 
Europe. Harari's Mossad career seemed at an end when, in the mid-1970s, one of 
the hit squads mistook a Moroccan waiter in Norway for an Arab terrorist and 
shot him dead. 
</P>
<P>
Harari also served as Mossad chief for Mexico and Central America before 
retiring in the late 1970s. After leaving the Mossad, Harari managed a large 
insurance firm for a while, published reports here said. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1983, Harari was reported to be selling arms to Panama. An Israeli 
partnership that included Harari won a contract to harvest lumber in Panama, 
and he was a middleman in deals that led to Israeli participation in public 
works and telephone projects in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Harari appeared in Jerusalem with credentials from the Panamanian 
government appointing him honorary consul in Israel, and he headed Panama's 
commercial mission here. That same year, he was photographed -- wearing his 
trademark aviator sunglasses -- escorting Panama's civilian president at that 
time, Eric A. Delvalle, around Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers reported that businessmen here resented Harari because they 
said he demanded participation in any dealings with Panama. "Mister 60%," his 
detractors called him. In 1988, Jose Blandon, Noriega's former consul in New 
York, told U.S. congressional investigators that Harari managed arms-smuggling 
operations for Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Israeli newspapers reported that Washington asked Israel to 
recall Harari from Panama, but Jerusalem responded that it had no control over 
him. But intelligence observers point out that it is rare for former Mossad 
officials to completely sever their links with the intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It would strain relations with the U.S. if someone working for Israel was also 
undermining the Americans in a place like Panama," said one observer.

The man who runs Panama has an office in the Presidential Palace and roars 
through town in a bulletproof limousine accompanied by armored cars full of 
large, heavily armed bodyguards who wear ominous dark glasses.

He decides who can walk free and who goes to jail, when citizens can be on the 
street and when they have to be in their houses, and even what avenues are open 
to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
This man is not President Guillermo Endara, nor is he the popular, charismatic 
2nd Vice President Guillermo (Billy) Ford, nor the intellectual 1st Vice 
President Ricardo Arias Calderon. He isn't even a Panamanian. 
</P>
<P>
And if you thought, well, it must be the American ambassador, you would be 
wrong. The man who runs Panama is a middle-aged career diplomat who has never 
reached the rank of ambassador -- in fact, he's never held a post higher than 
that of the No. 2 diplomat in the American Embassy in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
He is a tall, stooped American with thinning hair and a desire not to be 
identified in public. His name is John Bushnell -- and he is the closest thing 
the United States has to a proconsul. 
</P>
<P>
While Endara, a once-obscure lawyer with no political following, is enjoying 
the public trappings of office -- a Mercedes-Benz limousine, a tricolored 
presidential sash and bowing and scraping aides, Bushnell wears a simple, white 
sport shirt and nondescript slacks. 
</P>
<P>
The only things that set him apart from the crowd are his security guards and a 
white bulletproof vest that he wears outside his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
But, when the new Panamanian government was temporarily located in the Foreign 
Ministry, the two vice presidents had their offices in cramped quarters on the 
first floor -- while Bushnell was ensconced next to Endara in comfortable rooms 
on the second floor. He even lives in the same building where Endara, Ford and 
Arias live near the American Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
If Bushnell appears unassuming and his title is nothing more than U.S. deputy 
chief of mission, the people in the know here know who to talk to when things 
need to be done. 
</P>
<P>
When U.S. troops stepped over the bounds of international law and violated the 
diplomatic sanctity of the Nicaraguan ambassador by raiding his official 
residence, it was Bushnell who was called and who fixed things. 
</P>
<P>
And when American troops were trying to unnerve ousted dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega by playing loud rock music outside his hiding place in the Vatican 
embassy, it was Bushnell who ordered the broadcasts toned down after the 
Vatican's emissary complained that he couldn't sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell is reported to have approved sending American troops to seal the area 
around the Peruvian Embassy because of reports that Noriega might seek asylum 
there, and he was the one the Peruvian ambassador complained to. 
</P>
<P>
"No diplomat calls (U.S.) Ambassador (Arthur) Davis; he doesn't count," said a 
European envoy about Davis -- the almost invisible political appointee who is 
mocked by some associates as Elmer Fudd because he has a slight speech 
impediment. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Bushnell has signed off on curfew hours set for this capital 
city and makes the final decisions on which former Noriega officials and 
cronies are arrested. And, says a senior embassy official who asked not to be 
identified, until the Panamanian government is capable of assuming police and 
security functions, "the embassy is in operational control" of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
That means, says a different official, John Bushnell. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell's role is not the only unusual aspect of life in Panama in the wake of 
the Dec. 20 American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that invasion has been a massive influx of reporters and broadcast 
technicians. At one point, the figure reached nearly 500, many of whom had 
never covered a military operation nor been near danger. 
</P>
<P>
The number of journalists quickly overwhelmed the American military's capacity 
to deal with them. To pare down the total to something manageable, the U.S. 
Southern Command took an imaginative approach that showed more originality than 
some of its battle tactics. 
</P>
<P>
First, the military made life very uncomfortable -- preventing reporters from 
leaving U.S. bases but not providing places to sleep, adequate facilities for 
filing their dispatches or sufficient food. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the soldiers turned to scare tactics. After describing how his car had 
been shot at near the American Embassy and saying that "it is war out there," 
Col. Ronald Sconyers, the Southern Command's spokesman, said a charter flight 
had been arranged to take anyone to Miami who wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 125 of the 300 journalists in the room immediately signed on for the 
trip, even though none had been outside of the American-run Howard Air Base 
here or had been in Panama for more than 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Noriega has been thoroughly discredited -- and even the former 
dictator's most loyal supporters now sport Endara T-shirts -- some signs of the 
former regime remain. 
</P>
<P>
Standing 20 feet tall on Via Espana, one of Panama City's busiest streets, is a 
huge poster, unblemished by graffiti, pronouncing "Carlos Duque, President." 
</P>
<P>
Duque was Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate who was embarrassingly 
trounced in last May's vote. Noriega ultimately annulled the results. Duque is 
being sought by the U.S. military.
