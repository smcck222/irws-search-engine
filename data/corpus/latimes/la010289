CARING FOR THE EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Events converged during 1988 to make the state of the Earth a matter of keen 
public concern. Now comes the difficult part. In 1989 the involved officials 
must move forcefully to translate that concern into serious public policy so 
that this new awareness does not become just another passing trend or lost 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
The issues will not go away. There is a danger, however, that the enormousness 
of the collective problem will overwhelm a public desire to do something. After 
all, what can one person do about the atmosphere or the ocean? The United 
States has become a result-oriented nation that likes to see some bang for its 
buck, and soon. A dollar invested today to avert a global-warming crisis may 
have no visible payoff for decades. 
</P>
<P>
But perception is critically important. What made 1988 the year of the Earth 
may have been a coincidence of unrelated and largely irrelevant circumstances. 
The appearance of medical waste on Atlantic beaches or the Yellowstone Park 
fires had nothing to do with the ozone hole. The 1988 drought may have had 
nothing to do with global warming. The growing trash crisis certainly did not. 
But all these events impinged on the public consciousness until they set off an 
alarm bell: Something is very wrong. 
</P>
<P>
The importance of this public attention cannot be underrated. But little 
happened in 1988 that was new or surprising to most environmental scientists. 
And Earthlings possess most or all of the technical equipment needed to slow or 
halt just about all the bad things that are assaulting the planet. What has 
been lacking is the public demand, the political will and an institutional 
structure for facing the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The new year provides the opportunity for setting this process in motion. The 
obvious source of leadership is the presidency. President-elect George Bush 
already has been inundated with stacks of studies for combatting environmental 
problems on a national and global scale. One of the best was compiled by a 
50-member bipartisan task force under the chairmanship of Sens. Timothy E. 
Wirth (D-Colo.) and John Heinz III (R-Pa.). In addition to the more traditional 
regulatory controls, the plan emphasizes the search for common ground and the 
development of market incentives for pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
The Wirth-Heinz outline also makes the critical point that the public must be 
informed of the full social costs of environmental action or inaction, not just 
the direct outlays. Because so many environmental issues are interrelated, some 
policies will attack several problems at once and provide multiple benefits. 
The energy-efficiency program advocated by the Wirth-Heinz study would help 
fight global warming, acid rain and local air pollution while also improving 
U.S. energy security and productivity. Short-term investments can yield 
long-range national economic benefits. Existing fragmented federal policies 
often work at cross-purposes or lack the public attention and support that they 
deserve. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will have to decide what he thinks are the most effective means of 
advancing the environmental agenda. An address to Congress is an obvious 
possibility. Or he could revive the dormant President's Council on 
Environmental Quality, which is supposed to serve as a clearing house and as a 
coordinator of programs. Better yet would be the creation of a Cabinet 
Department of the Environment that would consolidate the Environmental 
Protection Agency with related agencies from within the Interior and 
Agriculture departments. Most other industrialized nations created 
cabinet-level environmental agencies years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Since so many of these issues observe no boundaries, the United States must 
pursue international agreements to control pollutants and preserve critical 
rain forests. The environment is an appropriate topic for the next superpower 
summit and the annual meeting of the Western industrial nations, leading 
perhaps to a global environmental conference. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental problems, from protection of U.S. wild lands to the global 
atmosphere, seem immense. Still, every citizen can have an effect. It begins 
with caring.

JUDGE'S RULING IN BABY KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I was a medical student in Sacramento in the 1970s, I was a member of a 
multidisciplinary team of professionals who worked hundreds of hours a year 
attempting to help children who were battered, tortured, and mutilated by 
people who unfortunately had the biological capability of bearing them. 
</P>
<P>
One particularly disgusting example was a female who had killed one of her 
children, severely tortured two others, and finally managed to kill a third, 
who had been sent back into the home by a "compassionate" judge who felt that 
the biological mother was more valuable than a foster one. This woman was 
admitted to our hospital in Sacramento to bear another child. 
</P>
<P>
Our child abuse team reacted quickly, obtaining a court order to take the 
newborn child away. The woman sued, but quickly dropped the case, deciding to 
move to Nevada and "have all the babies I want." I felt a profound sense of 
nausea, sadness, and anger for weeks following that horrible case. The outcome 
caused one of our social workers to resign -- she just couldn't handle these 
situations anymore. 
</P>
<P>
I felt the same sense of nausea, sadness, and anger when I read the article 
regarding Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald's ruling in the case of Sheryl Lynn 
Massip's battering and eventual murder of her infant son ("Judge Clears Mother 
Who Killed Baby," Part I, Dec. 24). 
</P>
<P>
From my previous reading about the case, there would appear little doubt that 
the woman battered and killed her son. A jury of her peers came to this 
conclusion after a long, and I am sure, emotionally difficult trial. There is 
little doubt in my mind also that the woman was emotionally distraught when she 
murdered her baby. 
</P>
<P>
But criminally insane? A much more profound proposition! When I worked as a 
family physician, I delivered hundreds of babies, and followed these kids and 
their mothers through the early years of their lives. No murders. A few 
distraught mothers who needed to talk out their frustrations, but no murders. 
What happened with Sheryl Lynn Massip? 
</P>
<P>
If Massip was criminally insane, why were the examining psychiatrists and her 
jurors unable to realize this? In explaining his reasoning, Judge Fitzgerald 
said, " . . . I didn't have any choice but to find her insane. . . . She was 
bonkers." Well, judge, I think you had two other fairly obvious choices: First, 
you could do your job as described by law; you could administer an appropriate 
sentence based upon the verdict handed down by the jury. A murder conviction 
demands a murder sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Second, if you truly bought the concept that the defendant was insane on the 
basis of postpartum depression, and was therefore totally out of control, you 
could have acted to save the lives of her future babies by ordering that the 
woman undergo sterilization. If she was truly insane as a result of her 
postpartum hormonal imbalance, why should she be any less insane with her next 
baby?

JUDGE'S RULING IN BABY KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since it seems quite likely that the Supreme Court will overturn or 
significantly modify Roe vs. Wade, Judge Fitzgerald's decision to reject the 
jury's guilty verdict in the Massip case is most timely. 
</P>
<P>
Abortions will no longer be necessary, anyway, now that the mother can run over 
the kid and plead "postpartum psychosis" (or "bonkers" to put it in the judge's 
more technical language).

THE CAMPUS AND PUBLIC SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Increasing numbers of college students want to serve their communities. Some 
help homeless people find shelter and services. Others tutor children or teach 
the illiterate how to read. Now a coalition of more than 40 California colleges 
and universities, public and private, has agreed to help these students to help 
others. The California Compact, as it is called, plans to work with communities 
to identify the problems on which students could work, try to win foundation 
support for these volunteer programs, and get faculty members as well as 
students involved. It's a gift of commitment that should not go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
The California Compact has just been launched as part of a national effort 
called Campus Compact, which is sponsored by the Education Commission of the 
States and has been in existence for several years. The California group is 
co-chaired by Stanford University President Don Kennedy and UCLA Chancellor 
Charles E. Young, and includes among others the University of Southern 
California, Occidental College, Claremont McKenna College, Los Angeles City 
College, the California State University system and the University of 
California campuses. The James Irvine Foundation has just announced a $120,000 
donation over the next three years to enable private universities to 
participate in the compact. 
</P>
<P>
It's just this kind of program that California legislators sought to foster 
when they passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara). That measure encouraged students to work 30 hours a year in their 
communities and urged their colleges to help them, in part by providing 
academic credit for some of their work. The efforts have gotten under way 
despite the governor's unwillingness to spend the $240,000 needed to help 
organize the program. 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the organization of the compact, UCLA's Chancellor Young said 
recently that government resources may continue to be scarce, "but our human 
resources are potentially unlimited." He said that the colleges want to help 
build a "citizenry of problem solvers." 
</P>
<P>
People who have studied college life have said for years that higher education 
could be made more meaningful if it inculcated in young Americans the value of 
public service. The California Compact aims to make that recommendation a 
reality.

POPULATION, RENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Andrea Rosenwein, in a Dec. 17 commentary ("L.A. Renters: Condemned to 
Extinction?" Editorial Page), bemoaned circumstances that forced her to join 
the "real word (of) exorbitant rents." However, this followed years of enjoying 
artificially low housing costs. An acknowledgement that the law (rent control, 
for example) can fix the price but not the cost of a commodity would have shown 
more real world awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is a mega-city beginning an explosive increase in population 
density; spacious lodgings in a desirable neighborhood in such a city are not 
easily had, particularly by those with low incomes. Most, like myself, wind up 
east or south of her neck of the woods, in whatever midway between splendor and 
squalor they can manage. 
</P>
<P>
There are 5 billion people in the world. If Rosenwein stopped worrying 
exclusively about developers and considered how many others would like to be 
where she is, the cost of her desired life style would be more explicable.

'CLEANING UP THE BALLOT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was pleased to read in The Times Dec. 26 editorial "Cleaning Up the Ballot" 
that you support initiative reform in California. The Times printed my 
initiative reform proposal "Keep the Initiatives but Reinvolve Legislators" on 
Nov. 27 (Op-Ed Page). 
</P>
<P>
While the indirect initiative process proposed by the League of Women Voters 
and supported by The Times sounds similar to my idea, there are some 
differences. According to the editorial, the League's proposal would allow 
initiative proponents to avoid the legislative process by requiring the 
signature gatherers to meet a higher signature quota than if they submitted it 
to review. This seems to me to subvert the very idea of indirect initiatives, 
i.e., to involve the governor and the Legislature in the process. 
</P>
<P>
My initiative reform solution would require the involvement of the governor and 
Legislature on any ballot initiative for which at least half the required 
signatures had been gathered. The governor would be required to appoint a 
three-member commission to make recommendations to him within 60 days. The 
Legislature would then have 90 days to deal with the governor's 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
We have had a plethora of initiatives lately because the governor and the 
Legislature have failed to deal with pressing problems facing California 
residents. My proposal would involve them in the process. That's what they are 
paid to do. 
</P>
<P>
As The Times points out, the initiative process provides an important "safety 
value" for the people of California, but as important as this process is, it 
can and should be improved.

OUR WATER FUTURE CAN'T BE TIED UP 40 YEARS IN THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE MILLER, Rep. George Miller, a Democrat, represents the 7th District 
of California. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forty years ago, Harry Truman was President, Frank Sinatra was a teen idol, and 
no one had ever heard of Watchman, Walkman, or "rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
And 40 years ago, the federal government began selling water from its dams and 
reservoirs, permitting crops and cities to flourish where once only desert 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the departing Reaganites in the Department of the Interior, at the urging 
of subsidized farmers in California, want to return to that bygone era and to 
finance their fantasy with your tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '40s, Americans didn't worry much about inflation, environmental 
quality or toxic pollution. Little thought was given to public-works subsidies 
or the ecological damage that such projects might cause. Nor were our current 
concerns about droughts as pronounced, since the federal project appeared to 
provide more water than Californians could even anticipate consuming. 
</P>
<P>
In the decades since then, we discovered that we had been extremely 
shortsighted in much of our planning and forecasting. Congress and the states 
have enacted tough laws that require the thorough evaluation of the impact on 
environmental quality from public and private projects -- the environmental 
impact statements. Government agencies, like private entities, have learned to 
comply with the strict requirements of this process. 
</P>
<P>
But not the Bureau of Reclamation. Its recent history all too often reflects a 
disregard for the spirit of the law and a total indifference to the 
environment, which is the responsibility of its parent agency, the Department 
of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
Four decades ago, irrigators in the Friant Division of the federal Central 
Valley Project secured a 40-year contract for federal irrigation water, paying 
a fraction of the true costs of that water back to taxpayers. Friant's 
inflation-free contract is about to expire, and the growers are demanding that 
the bureau renew it for another 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
No one objects to continuing deliveries to Friant. But isn't it prudent, at 
least once every 40 years, to reevaluate the volume of water that the 
government commits when antiquated contracts expire? Isn't it appropriate, once 
every two generations, to ask some basic questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does Friant really need all the water it has been receiving, or could 
improved conservation and better management reduce the volume? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Given the enormous changes in the California population and economy over 
the next four decades, should irrevocable commitments of public resources be 
made through the year 2029? Should water contracts instead be for 10-year 
periods, or 20, to permit periodic reevaluation and modification? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What are the ecological consequences of the Friant deliveries? We have 
learned that irrigation in the Central Valley has produced an unanticipated 
ecological catastrophe at the Kesterson wildlife refuge; are there any negative 
impacts resulting from the Friant contract that, at least, ought to be 
identified and addressed as part of any contract renewal? 
</P>
<P>
 -- And might others in California -- more efficient irrigators, fish and 
wildlife, or urban users like those in Los Angeles -- make better use of a 
portion of the Friant supply? 
</P>
<P>
These, and other pertinent questions, could best be answered through completion 
of a thorough environmental review of the request for contract renewal. But in 
an extraordinary decision, the Department of Interior recently rejected the 
need for an environmental impact statement on the new Friant contract, arguing 
instead that the government must renew existing contracts -- not just as 
Friant, but throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, in effect, argues that in the case of Bureau of Reclamation water 
contracts, we who live in the late 1980s are bound by the decisions of those in 
the 1940s -- no questions asked. Forget the efforts to slash the federal 
deficit and public subsidies; forget the drought and the need to demand 
efficiency in water use; forget the growth in California and the changes that 
have occurred in agriculture over the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The most outrageous aspect of the Interior Department's decision is not that we 
cannot order changes when necessary, but that public officials cannot even ask 
the prudent questions that should govern the commitment of public resources. 
How will the residents of Los Angeles, or Fresno, or Northern California 
respond when told that there is no more water for them, despite the expenditure 
of billions in tax dollars on developing additional supplies, because all the 
water was committed 40 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
Neither we in government, nor taxpayers, nor those who will invariably (and 
rightfully) sue to overturn the department's preposterous position should have 
to even raise these questions. It should go without saying that when a public 
agency has the opportunity to reevaluate a major policy decision 40 years after 
it was initiated, it should carefully review that decision in light of 
contemporary concerns. If the Interior Department's legal experts don't think 
so -- they should think again.

<P>
Variety Baby used the middle of the track to overtake favorite T.V. of Crystal 
and win the $82,800 La Brea Stakes by a half length Sunday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The La Brea is the first of three races for 4-year-old fillies in the La Canada 
Series, which also includes the $100,000 El Encino Stakes, Jan. 21, and the 
$200,000-added La Canada Stakes, Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Baby, ridden by Corey Black, came into the stretch four wide and wore 
down T.V. of Crystal in the final sixteenth. Sent off as second choice of the 
crowd of 34,606, Variety Baby covered the 7 furlongs in 1:21 3-5 and paid $7, 
$3.20, $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
T.V. of Crystal, ridden by Chris McCarron, paid $3.20 and $2.80. Forewarning, 
ridden by Laffit Pincay Jr., was another 4 1/2 lengths back in the field of 8 
and paid $4.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
Variety Baby, trained by Bruce Headley, earned $40,050 for owner and breeder, 
Kjell H. Qvale. 
</P>

Al Iafrate scored a power-play goal with 6:23 remaining in regulation time to 
give the Toronto Maple Leafs a 3-3 tie with the Blackhawks Sunday night at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto, which trailed 3-1 after two periods, got to within one goal at 9:45 of 
the third period when ex-Blackhawk Ed Olczyk banged his own rebound past 
replacement goaltender Ed Belfour for his 21st goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Belfour replaced Darren Pang 5:19 into the third period after Pang was injured 
during a goal-mouth scramble. 
</P>
<P>
Iafrate tied the game when he beat Belfour with a 40-foot slap shot at 13:37 
for his sixth goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago took a 2-0 lead on first-period goals by Wayne Presley and Dave Manson. 
Presley, who had not scored since Dec. 14, beat Toronto goaltender Ken Wregget 
to his glove side with a 25-foot slap shot from the left circle at 8:07, and 
Manson beat Wregget to the glove side with a 30-footer at 9:34 during a power 
play.

Montreal 4, Vancouver 0 -- Patrick Roy stopped 39 shots for his third shutout

NEWSWIRE: NYKANEN WINS SKI-JUMP LEG; THOMA FOURTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Olympic triple gold medalist Matti Nykanen of Finland won the second leg of the 
traditional Four-Hill ski jumping tour by soaring 109 and 102 meters in his two 
jumps at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
West German Dieter Thoma, who won the first segment of the event in Oberstdorf 
two days earlier, managed only a fourth-place finish in the second leg but held 
on to his lead in both the Four-Hill tournament and the World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
Thoma had jumps of 104.5 and 102.5 meters Sunday, trailing second-place 
finisher Jens Weissflog of East Germany and Finland's Risto Laakonen, who came 
in third. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Thoma swept down the track after his first jump, visibly 
angered that he had to land prematurely when a strong sidewind began pushing 
him wide of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Weissflog had jumps of 104 and 100 meters and Laakonen landed with 107.5 and 
99.5 in his two attempts, both earning more style points from the judges than 
did Thoma to finish ahead of the tournament leader.

A stagehands strike in Toronto forced cancellation of the National Ballet of 
Canada's last sold-out holiday performances last year of "The Nutcracker." Four 
matinee and evening performances of the traditional ballet and one of the 
farcical "Nutty Nutcracker" were canceled from Thursday to Saturday. "The union 
refuses to put stagehands on the job while mediation talks are in session," 
Charles Cutts, general manager of the O'Keefe Center, said in a statement. The 
O'Keefe's theater seats 3,000. The National Ballet has been performing the 
holiday favorite annually since 1964. The International Alliance of Theatrical 
Stage Employees' local and the center are in a dispute over the use of outside 
technical workers by touring productions. STEVE WEINSTEIN and DAVID CROOK

Actor Martin Sheen won a ruling Thursday from the Nevada Supreme Court 
overturning a requirement that he post a $5,000 bond aimed at stopping a 
protest trespass at the Nevada Test Site. Sheen, active in the movement against 
nuclear testing, was forced to post the "peace bond" after saying on national 
television he would "hopefully commit civil disobedience" at the test site. In 
reversing District Judge Bill Beko of Tonopah, the Supreme Court said in its 
2-page order that prosecutors conceded that civil disobedience isn't a crime in 
Nevada. STEVE WEINSTEIN and DAVID CROOK

MACAL LEADS PACIFIC SYMPHONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With each guest conductor leading the Pacific Symphony while the search for a 
new music director goes on, the orchestra has responded with alertness and 
security. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee Symphony music director Zdenek Macal took his turn Saturday with a 
New Year's Eve pops program at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Macal is an interesting conductor to watch. He feints, he jabs, he flirts, he 
pouts, he argues, he suffers. He plucks notes out of the air. He directs 
finger-shimmies at the musicians. He crouches to half his height for the right 
pianissimo, rises to bring the music to a climax and finishes with little, 
happy jumping hops. He is capable of singing along with the players at the most 
expressive moments. 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the Pacific rarely gave him expressiveness to match, and it may 
not have been entirely the orchestra's fault. 
</P>
<P>
While always enforcing clarity, balance, proportion, exactness and discipline, 
Macal eschewed flights of lyricism or poetry. He could be fussy in detail, yet 
cool in overall aim and phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
The overtures to Strauss' "Die Fledermaus" and Offenbach's "Orpheus in the 
Underworld" were vigorous and clean, but not sweet or sparkling. Even 
Offenbach's famous cancan lacked a sense of fun. 
</P>
<P>
The conductor and pianist Jeffrey Siegel pretty much missed the style boat in 
Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue." Macal took a Teutonic, declamatory approach to 
the work, while Siegel viewed it as if he were playing Tchaikovsky's virtuosic 
First Concerto or perhaps one of Prokofiev's keen-edged works. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel stabbed at the sustaining pedal with his right foot, kept time by 
tapping with his left, thundered at the keyboard with steely facility and 
occasionally veered into honky-tonk style as if an inner voice suddenly nagged, 
"Jazz score . . . Jazz score. . . ." But it was a sometime thing. 
</P>
<P>
Macal enforced such rigid rhythms that when the big tune arrived, it sounded 
fatigued and oddly accented. Clarinetist Emily Bernstein, who in other works 
offered fine playing, proved tentative and inexpressive in the famous opening 
solo. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone came off best in the Suite from Strauss' "Der Rosenkavalier." The 
orchestra sounded strong and secure, and Macal conveyed sweep and power but 
only a little of the poignancy and intoxication of this magical score.

A provincial court in Egypt has ordered the television series "Falcon Crest" 
off the air on grounds it undermines public morals, according to a newspaper 
report. The newspaper Wafd, published by a centrist opposition party of the 
same name, said Thursday the ruling banning the show was in a provincial court 
in the Nile Valley town of Shibin el-Kom. "Falcon Crest" began appearing 
several years ago on local television and quickly became a favorite among both 
poor and wealthy Egyptians, despite its depiction of a society generally 
foreign to the mostly conservative Egyptians. Television censors, for example, 
routinely cut kissing scenes from "Falcon Crest" that they consider too 
passionate. The TV series "Dallas," a predecessor of "Falcon Crest," also was 
widely popular until it was stopped six years ago after a member of parliament 
complained it was corrupting the morals of Egyptian youth. STEVE WEINSTEIN and

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: DOCUMENTARY SERIES FOCUSES ON SOCIAL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four feature-length documentaries on social and political issues will be shown 
over the next three weekends at the Monica 4-Plex. They will be screened 
Saturday and Sunday mornings simultaneously but with staggered starting times: 
Cathy Zheutlin's "Just One Step: The Great Peace March" (10:15), Martyn Burke's 
"Witnesses: Afghanistan -- The Untold Story" (10:30), Morley Markson's "Growing 
Up in America" (10:45) and Beverly Shaffer's "To a Safer Place" (11). 
</P>
<P>
All of them are worthy rather than dazzling efforts, and they all tend to pound 
out the points that their makers wish to make. 
</P>
<P>
The most affecting is "To a Safer Place," an occasionally awkward and 
self-conscious but rewarding study of Shirley Turcotte, a 36-year-old Vancouver 
phone company executive, wife and mother, who reveals her nightmarish 
childhood. From the time she was a toddler until she was at last able to escape 
to a foster home at 14, she was the victim of her brutal father's incest. By 
the time Turcotte was filmed she had already pretty much come to terms with her 
past and had become an activist in the prevention of child abuse; consequently, 
the film is more in the spirit of advocacy rather than self-discovery. Even so, 
her conversations with her family and even former neighbors are strong stuff, 
and the film makes clear the awful helplessness and guilt of the abused child. 
</P>
<P>
"Just One Step: The Great Peace March" captures the tremendously spiritual 
experience those 500 anti-war, anti-nuke protesters underwent in the course of 
their 1986 nine-month march from Los Angeles to Washington. Unfortunately, the 
film in its attempt to hammer home its message becomes repetitive and wearying 
long before the marchers reach the District of Columbia. There are some nifty 
moments along the way, however -- e.g., the elderly man who runs the Reagan 
Information Center in the President's hometown, Dixon, Ill., and who reasons 
that "more bombs make for more jobs." 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses" is an illuminating, comprehensive and utterly relentless account of 
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, focusing on the incredibly brave, resilient 
and unyielding Afghans and a remarkable band of Westerners who are trying to 
come to their aid. This is a sobering, invaluable account of a war that has 
been called "Russia's Vietnam," but we're shown so much suffering that the film 
becomes numbing. 
</P>
<P>
On a lighter note "Growing Up in America" contrasts footage of a group of '60s 
radicals with contemporary interviews with them. Inevitably, there's Abbie 
Hoffman, who has kept the faith, Jerry Rubin, who thinks he has, even though 
he's become a Manhattan entrepreneur, and Allen Ginsberg, who remains 
wonderfully transcendent no matter how often he shows up in such documentaries. 
Of the 10 subjects attorney William Kunstler is by far the most incisive. While 
acknowledging that he has lived a good, fulfilling life he stresses that in 
regard to racism and other social ills, America has actually changed very 
little since the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
Monica 4-Plex information: (213) 394-9741. 
</P>
<P>
As a curtain-raiser to its weekend morning New Chinese Cinema series, the Nuart 
is presenting Sunday and next Monday Xie Fei and U Lan's exquisite "Girl From 
Hunan," adapted from a 60-year-old classic novel by Shen Congwen that indicts 
the cruelty of child marriage. As it tells of the fate of a 16-year-old peasant 
girl, Xiao Xiao (Na Renhua), already married for four years to a boy a decade 
her junior, it exudes a sensuality that has been exceedingly rare in the 
Chinese cinema and has some nude scenes that are, in fact, regarded as a first. 
</P>
<P>
At first Xiao Xiao's life seems reasonably idyllic -- for one thing she somehow 
escaped having her feet bound -- but then she and a farmhand (Deng Xiaotung), 
too poor to afford a wife, become mutually attracted. Considering the zealous 
puritanism of their community the film concludes surprisingly (though not 
without irony). The film is set in 1910 but it might as well be antiquity, yet 
it's clear that its feminist sentiments are meant to reverberate in today's 
China. For full schedule: (213) 478-6379, 479-5269.

ISRAEL BANISHES 15 ARABS IN BID TO CURB UPRISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Israel on Sunday banished 15 Palestinians considered to be activist leaders of 
the Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in an apparent 
challenge to the United States, which has condemned such actions in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The expulsions followed the close of one of the bloodiest months in the 
uprising, now nearly 13 months old. According to data compiled by an Israeli 
member of Parliament, Israeli soldiers shot and killed 31 Arabs during December 
and wounded another 400. 
</P>
<P>
More than 330 Palestinians have died during the uprising. Ten Israeli Jews and 
one Israeli Arab also have been killed. A total of 51 Arabs have been banished 
from the country during the intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flown to Lebanon 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army flew the 15 by helicopter to southern Lebanon, where they were 
each given $50 taxi fare, Israel Radio reported. The 15 then headed for an 
office of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction 
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the radio added. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the Palestinians taken out of the country Sunday agreed to leave after 
giving up their court appeals in return for the right to come home in five 
years -- provided they refrain from taking part in "negative actions" against 
Israel. The rest refused the deal and are barred "for life." 
</P>
<P>
The banishment was "due to their involvement in the leadership of the uprising 
and the direction of it," an army spokesman declared. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has opposed expulsions as a violation of due process as well 
as of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the removal of civilians 
from land under military occupation "for any reason whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
There was no reaction Sunday from the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian observers lashed out at the Israeli move. "The timing is 
atrocious," Palestinian lawyer Jonathan Kuttab said. "When people are beginning 
to talk solutions, talk peace, the Israelis create frustration." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appeals to U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Kuttab called on Washington to put some bite into its customary condemnation of 
the expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
The United States recently dropped a 13-year prohibition and opened contact 
with the PLO, to which most Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza owe their political 
loyalty. "The strength of the United States criticism of Israel will be a test 
of its intentions to foster peace," Kuttab argued. 
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said the newly expelled Arabs played "leading roles" in the 
intifada and that most belonged to Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction headed by 
Yasser Arafat. Among the 15, the radio singled out four for special mention: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rizek Bayari, 29, a journalist who led popular committees in the northern 
Gaza Strip and was charged with "directing violence" in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abdallah abu Samahadana, 38, a lecturer at Islamic University in Gaza. 
Samahadana spent four years in jail on charges of transporting hand grenades 
and was released last year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Massoud Zaefer, 42, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine who was a leader of the uprising in Nablus, the largest and most 
militant Palestinian city on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abdel Hamid Baba, 25, a Fatah activist in the Amari refugee camp who is 
reported to be responsible for violence in Ramallah, a West Bank city north of 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources said that the expulsions, in the works since August, were 
timed to coincide with Sunday's 24th anniversary of the first PLO guerrilla 
operation inside Israel, observed by the Palestinians as "Fatah Day." The 
timing was a means of depressing Palestinian morale, the source said. In an 
attempt at showing its psychological impact, the official compared the action 
to a military raid Dec. 9 on a PLO faction's headquarters in Lebanon. That raid 
coincided with the first anniversary of the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Local Committees Targeted 
</P>
<P>
Removal of Palestinian leaders has been part of an Israeli effort to break the 
back of so-called popular committees that have spearheaded Arab resistance to 
Israeli rule in the occupied territories. Last August, Israeli authorities 
accused the 15 Palestinians of leading the committees in various localities and 
prepared the cases for expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, a Defense Ministry spokesman said the popular committees were 
designed "to impose by violent means the orders of the PLO and the uprising's 
leaders on the population, to undermine the Israeli authorities . . . and to 
create alternative mechanisms instead." 
</P>
<P>
The number of December clashes and the expulsions appeared to be a concrete 
sign of Israel's tough defiance of efforts in the international community to 
encourage peace talks by Israel with the PLO. Israel refuses to make contact 
with the organization, which it believes is unswervingly bent on destroying the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials insist that peace talks with non-PLO Palestinians must be 
preceded by an end to the intifada. In the meantime, Israeli army officials 
have pledged to take the fight to stone-throwing youths in Arab towns and 
villages. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the Israeli army authorized occupying soldiers in the West Bank 
and Gaza to use so-called plastic bullets, whose lethal range is said to be 
less than that of full-metal projectiles. When the bullets were introduced, 
firing rules were relaxed; it no longer was necessary for a "life threatening" 
situation to arise before troops could shoot into crowds or at individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin predicted that the bullets would increase the 
number of wounded but reduce the number of dead. 
</P>
<P>
The prediction about fatalities is debatable. In the close quarters of Arab 
neighborhoods, the plastic bullets -- actually a blend of plastic and metal -- 
have proved as lethal as regular cartridges. In August, more than 20 Arabs were 
shot to death. The toll dipped in both September and October, climbed to 20 
again in November and surged to 31 in December. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 16, paratroopers based in Nablus shot and killed eight Palestinians 
during unrest that followed a funeral for an earlier victim -- the highest 
one-day fatal toll in a single city since the uprising began. Arabs have taken 
to calling the shootings "the Nablus massacre." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
40 Killed in April 
</P>
<P>
The only month to top December in carnage was last April, when more than 40 
Palestinians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Yossi Sarid, a member of Israel's Parliament from the leftist 
Citizens' Rights Party, wrote to Defense Minister Rabin to protest the use of 
plastic bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"When Israel started using plastic bullets, the basic assumption was: They 
don't kill," Sarid said in an interview. "This evidently is not the case. The 
use of the bullets is intolerable. The death figures are horrible." 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, Israel's attorney general, Yosef Harish, said he would 
investigate the use of the bullets. His report would not be officially binding, 
but, as legal adviser to the government, his opinion might have some impact, 
Israeli observers say. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the army imposed a curfew on the entire Gaza Strip in an effort to 
prevent protests or violence connected to the PLO anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
During the day, at least five Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, Arab 
sources said. The army reported that two teen-agers were shot in the legs when 
soldiers fired at dozens of stone-throwing youths in Ramallah, on the West 
Bank.

<P>
A Brazilian excursion ship jammed with New Year's revelers bound for a 
fireworks display capsized and sank after ignoring an order to return to port, 
officials said Sunday. At least 51 people died. 
</P>
<P>
The sightseeing ship was carrying at least 131 people -- above its reported 
capacity of 100 -- and sank in 65 feet of water in Rio's Guanabara Bay about 
11:45 p.m. Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the exact cause of the sinking, but we think it was because of 
excess capacity," said Maj. Oldemiro Santos of the Fire Department's maritime 
group in Rio de Janeiro state. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said 51 bodies have been recovered and a search for survivors is 
continuing. Some passengers are believed trapped in the hull of the vessel, 
said Col. Jefferson Cardoso de Bem, chief of the maritime group. Among the dead 
was the boat's captain. 
</P>
<P>
The ship was so crowded that a naval vessel ordered it to return to port, but 
it ignored the order, said Irineu Barroso, chief of Rio's 10th police precinct. 
Some survivors confirmed that account, saying the ship had been stopped by 
officials and ordered to shore but that it set out a second time. 
</P>
<P>
De Bem said he had no accurate number of survivors or of the number missing 
because several boats took part in rescue attempts, and survivors were taken to 
hospitals throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
The boat, a popular tourist attraction that offers daily cruises of the bay, 
was to anchor in the Atlantic Ocean so passengers could view the midnight 
fireworks display at Copacabana Beach. The $220-per-ticket dinner cruise was 
heavily promoted in local newspapers and at tourist hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The double-decked ship Bateau Mouche sank between Sugar Loaf Mountain and a 
small island as it rounded the bend on the western side of Guanabara Bay near 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"The top deck was so crowded you could hardly move," a Brazilian woman told 
Brazil's TV Globo. "The boat was completely full, including lots of children. 
Then everything began shaking back and forth. People were shouting: 'It's going 
to flip over!' " 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Fabricio Calo, who was rescued by a fishing boat, said: "The boat was 
turning and shifting. Then tables started flying, glass started crashing, and 
the whole boat just turned over on its side." 
</P>
<P>
"This was not an accident," said one passenger, a business executive from Sao 
Paulo. "No effort was made to control the number of passengers who got on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Didn't Want to Go' 
</P>
<P>
Paulo Soares, 28, a brother-in-law of the Bateau Mouche's captain, Camilo da 
Costa, 50, said at the mooring station: "Camilo didn't want to go out. He said 
the boat was overloaded, and the sea was too rough. But he had no choice. He 
would lose his job if he didn't sail." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Sol e Mar restaurant, which organized the excursion, said 
at least 131 people were on board, according to an incomplete reservation list. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, refused further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Rio newspaper O Globo reported Sunday that an American may have been on 
board. The U.S. Consulate said it was not authorized to give out any 
information about possible U.S. victims. 
</P>
<P>
The vessel capsized quickly, according to passenger Hans Leutner, 56. The West 
German said: "It was clear that the boat was overloaded. As it was going out, 
it was not very high in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"The boat tipped slightly to one side and did not come back," Leutner said. "In 
half a minute it had gone." 
</P>
<P>
On television, former Planning Minister Anibal Teixeira fought back tears as he 
spoke of the disaster in which his wife, Maria Jose Andrade Teixeira de Souza, 
died. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Adam, 34, said she tugged an officer's shirt to ask: "Aren't we 
overloaded?" Adam, a French citizen, reported that he told her not to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband Jean, 43, who once sailed with the French navy, said he didn't 
believe the flat-keeled boat was suitable for seagoing trips. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had been thrown into the sea and returned to the sinking ship for 
his wife, a poor swimmer. He failed to find her, but the two were reunited on 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
"She had the sort of luck you have only once in your life," Adam said. A 
passenger gave her a chair that she held onto until rescued by fishermen.

<TEXT>
<P>
There's good news for people concerned about the spread of AIDS and widened 
drug use, but there's bad news for new-car dealers and shady travel promoters 
who like to cut corners to make a quick buck. Taking effect on New Year's Day 
were many of the 1,647 bills passed by the Legislature and signed into law by 
Gov. George Deukmejian during 1988. Here's a sampling of the new laws and what 
they do:

</P>
<P>
Toy Guns -- Manufacture, sale or distribution of realistic-looking toy guns is

IN NEW YEAR'S DAY PRAYER, HE URGES COMMITMENT TO COMBAT EVIL

<TEXT>
<P>
Pope John Paul II on Sunday urged Christians and "all men of good will" to 
commit themselves to building peace and justice in the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope, observing the Roman Catholic Church's traditional "World Day of 
Peace," spoke from his Vatican apartment to 30,000 pilgrims and tourists massed 
in brilliant sunshine in St. Peter's Square for the noon Angelus prayer 
traditionally held on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Before the prayer, John Paul celebrated High Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, 
where he repeated his dedication to the rights of racial minorities in 1989 and 
the duty of governments to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
"The New Year that begins today is under the sign of the maternity of Maria, 
queen of peace, almost to signify a new hope, a renewed purpose," John Paul 
said in his address broadcast throughout the world by Vatican Radio. 
</P>
<P>
"If the forces of evil and hate insist in their destructive activity, we, the 
disciples of the Lord and of Mary, will insist still more, together with all 
men of good will, in the commitment to the building of peace and justice," the 
Pope said. 
</P>
<P>
At the High Mass, attended by some 10,000 pilgrims and diplomats accredited to 
the Holy See, John Paul prayed that "the face of the Lord" will rest upon the 
world in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"We express the wish that it may be the year of peace, of justice and of 
growing solidarity, of social solicitude for each person and for everybody," 
the Pope said. "May peace, justice and solidarity grow in men and society. 
</P>
<P>
"May they grow and mature in human consciences, as also in the daily toil of 
conscience and willingness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pope recalled that the Second Vatican Council, held in the 1960s, declared 
that "in all the nations of the Earth there exists a single people of God." 
</P>
<P>
"Precisely because of this, on this day the church thinks of all men of the 
entire planet, of all nations, in which each person finds his own human roots 
and his own identity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rights of Racial Minorities 
</P>
<P>
John Paul quoted excerpts from his message for World Peace Day, published by 
the Vatican on Dec. 9 and dedicated this year to the rights of racial 
minorities and the duty of all states to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect for minority groups should be considered, in some way, the touchstone 
for harmonious social coexistence and as an index of the civil maturity 
achieved by a country and its institutions," the Pope said, quoting from his 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"Guaranteeing the participation of minorities in public life is a sign of 
elevated civil progress, and this turns to the honor of those nations in which 
all citizens are guaranteed such participation in a climate of true liberty," 
he said.

Eleven Filipinos were killed and about 2,000 injured in firecracker blasts, 
stabbings and shootings during New Year's revelry, officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Police said two people died in blazes sparked in Manila slums by firecracker 
explosions. Filipinos traditionally set off firecrackers and shoot guns into 
the air to usher in the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Philippines News Agency, quoting police officials in the 
capital, said the celebration was relatively peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital workers said five people were shot to death and 11 injured, most by 
stray bullets. Three men were stabbed to death and 14 reported hurt in drunken 
knife fights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killed by Bomb 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said a man died when a homemade bomb hurled at him exploded on 
his chest. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 people were taken to hospitals for cuts, burns and other blast 
injuries as well as stab wounds, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The firecracker blasts ignited blazes in six Manila districts. More than 14,000 
people were reported to have lost their homes in the fires and investigators 
put initial property damage estimates at about $2.4 million.

IZVESTIA SAYS A LIGHT-HEARTED GOODBY TO 1988

<P>
The newspaper Izvestia said goodby to 1988 with a good measure of humor Sunday, 
saying it hadn't been hard to give up one-candidate elections, jammed radio 
programs and other former staples of Soviet life abolished last year. 
</P>
<P>
The government newspaper toasted many changes made during 1988, including the 
improvement in supplies at liquor stores, which resulted from the Kremlin's 
realization that its crackdown on alcohol had created a massive network of 
moonshine distillers. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's raise our glasses to it (1988), because among other things it helped us 
get rid of the lines for this holiday drink," Izvestia's correspondent Yuri 
Makarov wrote in a rare bit of levity published in the central Soviet press. 
</P>
<P>
The article was headlined "Congratulations on the Old Year." 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the events of 1988, Izvestia said goodby to West German daredevil 
pilot Mathias Rust, who was allowed to return home in August after serving 14 
months of a four-year sentence for making an unauthorized landing in Red 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Madcap Inspector' 
</P>
<P>
"Auf wiedersehen Mathias Rust, madcap inspector of our anti-aircraft defenses," 
Izvestia said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper saluted the dramatic changes that took place in the Soviet Union 
last year as the country pursued Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
perestroika program of political and economic reform and his glasnost policy of 
openness. 
</P>
<P>
Many government bureaucrats were sent to work in industry as ministries were 
slashed or reduced, and multi-candidate elections to a new two-tiered 
Parliament were scheduled for 1989 as part of sweeping constitutional changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Farewell to the exciting election of one deputy from one candidate," Izvestia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We bade farewell to some officials who ruled our country. . . . We bade 
farewell to a number of ministries and branches despite their desire to stay 
on. How invincible and compulsory they seemed to be for many years!" 
</P>
<P>
Of the decision to stop jamming foreign radio broadcasts, Izvestia said 
tongue-in-cheek that it was difficult to abandon the belief that millions of 
dollars must be spent "to save our ears from the misinformation of foreign 
radios." 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia praised another new direction of glasnost taken in 1988 -- the end to 
the intentional distortion of maps. 
</P>
<P>
"It was also difficult for us to abandon the conviction that maps of our 
country are issued only to mislead foreign spies," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Now better maps are being issued "and a precise map of Moscow can be bought not 
just in London." 
</P>
<P>
Places and institutions re-named after Leonid I. Brezhnev and Konstantin U. 
Chernenko, former Soviet leaders now officially linked with stagnation, resumed 
their old names last year -- another change praised by Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
"We departed from the city of Brezhnev with a light heart," the newspaper said. 
The old name of the city on the Volga, Naberezhniye Chelny, was restored last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
"Goodby, 1988. You were a good year. But at the same time you were a difficult 
year, and frankly speaking, it is a good thing that you are leaving," Izvestia 
said.

KABUL, SOVIETS DECLARE CEASE-FIRE BUT REBELS ATTACK 2 VILLAGES

The Soviet-backed Afghan government began a cease-fire on New Year's Day, but 
U.S.-backed Muslim rebels rejected the truce and attacked government troops in 
two villages, Kabul Radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire offer was made Friday by Afghan President Najibullah, and the 
Soviet Union announced Saturday that its troops would join the truce. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised address to his nation Sunday, Najibullah complained that rebels 
have expanded operations against his government and repeated his offer of 
direct talks with them, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported. He also 
rejected any future Afghan government that excludes the present leadership, 
Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels recently opened talks with Soviet representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas attacked government troops Sunday in two villages in eastern 
Nangarahar province, Kabul Radio reported in a broadcast monitored in 
Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
The radio said eight guerrillas were killed and seven wounded in the attack on 
the military posts in Gushta and Deh Bala. It gave no casualty figures for 
government troops, but it said that soldiers launched mopping-up operations 
against the rebels after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Ahmad Shah said the cease-fire was "a condemnable suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
The seven-party Guerrilla Alliance named Shah head of a provisional Islamic 
government, that has yet to be installed. 
</P>
<P>
"It only shows how desperate Najib is," Shah said in a statement issued in 
Peshawar, Pakistan. "Najib has repeatedly proposed such meaningless 
cease-fires, but every time we rejected them." 
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Masood Khalili said of Najibullah's offer: "We did not start 
our fight because he asked us to. And we won't stop because he asked us to." 
</P>
<P>
Khalili belongs to the Jamaat-i-Islami guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Soviet soldiers marched into Afghanistan in 1979 to help the 
Marxist government fight Muslim rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Half the Soviet troops left last year under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord 
signed in Geneva by Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet 
Union. The rest of the Soviet troops are to withdraw by Feb. 15.

THATCHER SPURNS REVENGE IN JET BOMBING

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher distanced herself on Sunday from U.S. vows to 
punish whoever planted the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think an eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth is ever valid," she said 
in a wide-ranging New Year's television interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing to do is to try to get the cooperation of all nations 
to track these people down so that they are brought to justice," she said on 
the "David Frost on Sunday" program. 
</P>
<P>
The danger of revenge, she said, is that "it can affect innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan said in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday that the United 
States would punish those responsible for the bomb, which brought the Boeing 
747 down in southern Scotland, killing all 259 people on board and at least 11 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan said a report overseen by President-elect George Bush advocating 
possible military action against terrorists "ought to be giving some people 
sleepless nights" in the wake of the Dec. 21 bombing. He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Seek Hard, Punish Firmly' 
</P>
<P>
Bush vowed last week to "seek hard and punish firmly, decisively, those who did 
this, if you could ever find them." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher allowed Reagan to use U.S. bombers based in Britain to bomb Libya in 
1986 in retaliation for alleged Libyan involvement in international terrorism.

She said Sunday that no country should grant the Pan Am terrorists safe haven 
or permit them to escape justice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think public opinion is disgusted with nations that will not try to track 
down terrorists, absolutely disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say no group has offered a credible claim of responsibility for 
the attack. Speculation on suspects has focused mostly on Palestinian 
extremists and pro-Iranian Shia Muslims.

No Celebrations 
</P>
<P>
Searchers in Lockerbie, Scotland, gave up their traditional New Year's 
celebrations Sunday to continue the hunt for bodies and wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that one more body, thought to be one of the missing local 
residents, was recovered, bringing the total to 242. 
</P>
<P>
Only 35 have been identified and released to relatives for burial. Capt. Bruce 
Smith, a Pan Am pilot whose English wife, Ingrid, was killed, was quoted in the 
Sunday Telegraph as saying the Scottish police were "paralyzed by inexperience 
and incompetence." 
</P>
<P>
John Boyd, chief constable of the Dumfries and Galloway police, replied at a 
news conference: "I am sure no one would thank me for shortcutting any legal or 
evidential gathering processes which may . . . help to bring the person or 
persons (responsible) to justice." 
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people are expected at a memorial service Wednesday in Lockerbie, 
and 1,000 more will watch on monitor screens in nearby halls. 
</P>
<P>
British newspapers reported Saturday that investigators believe the bomb was 
smuggled onto the flight in Frankfurt, possibly by a Lebanese-born passenger 
duped into carrying it. The West German government said no evidence supports 
those reports. 
</P>
<P>
Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727 jet and switched to a 
Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow Airport for the trip to New York. 
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times of London said the bomb was loaded into the airplane's forward 
cargo hold next to the electronic nerve center that keeps the jet airborne.

DEMOLITION IS STOPPED ON HISTORIC MCKINLEY HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Italian Renaissance-styled McKinley Mansion, which is on Los Angeles' 
official list of historic-cultural monuments, was saved from the wrecker's ball 
over the weekend after a city building inspector arrived on the scene and 
declared that a demolition permit had been issued by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Contractors hired by owner Jason Lee had been at work an hour or more and did 
what could be thousands of dollars in damage before building inspector Michael 
D. Tharpe ordered them to stop demolishing the $4.5-million property at 301 S. 
Lafayette Park Place on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
By the time neighbors' complaints and police inquiries had brought out the 
building inspector, the wreckers had smashed the front patio superstructure, 
wrecked the adjacent arbors and made a number of gashes in the main part of the 
house, including exposing the wood frame on the southwest corner. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said Sunday that his contractors had obtained the demolition permit from 
the city Friday afternoon, and he believed that he was fully authorized to 
destroy the 13,000-square-foot house, built in 1917 and named for the late 
mortuary operator, Maytor H. McKinley. Lee wants to remove the house to make 
way for a 140-unit apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
However, an official of the Los Angeles Conservancy, Christy McAvoy, said a 
demolition permit cannot legitimately be issued, pending completion of an 
environmental impact report and exploration of alternative uses for the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"The owners were aware of that, but they evidently took advantage of the 
situation in the city offices on the eve of a holiday," she said. "The permits 
division may have been shorthanded. These properties are supposed to be clearly 
flagged in the city's files, however, so I really don't know how they got the 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very saddened by the owners' action. We had a substantial communication 
with them, and the situation had been fully explained to them. I'm deeply 
disappointed that they chose to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Lee, who said he has owned the property for about seven months, said he had 
grown tired of waiting for the city to act and told his contractors this fall 
to see what they could do about getting a demolition permit. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the city's building inspector had told him he was stopping the 
demolition only until Tuesday, when the city would decide what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
Lee showed the permit his contractors had obtained to a reporter Sunday. He 
also displayed a city report saying that the Cultural Heritage Board had lifted 
a 180-day stay on issuing a demolition permit last March and said he knew 
nothing about any requirement for an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
Present at the house Sunday was another man, Rod Daniels, a San Fernando Valley 
developer who said he has been seeking permission to move the house to 
Chatsworth and that he would like to live in it. It has also been proposed that 
the house be left where it is and used as an AIDS hospice.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy was killed and a 5-year-old girl critically injured Sunday 
afternoon by a hit-and-run driver whose car dragged them for nearly a 
half-block in Long Beach, police said. 
</P>
<P>
So Den Tang was killed and Anika Elk was in critical condition after the 
driver's older-model Lincoln Continental struck them as they crossed Alamitos 
Street at 17th Street about 3:30 p.m., Long Beach Police Lt. Craig Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
"He just kept on going after dragging them under his car," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
The two children were taken to St. Mary Medical Center, where the boy died a 
short time later, he said.

TWO KILLED, WOMAN BADLY HURT IN NEW YEAR'S EVE PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man and a woman were killed and another woman critically injured in a New 
Year's Eve crash of a single-engine airplane in the snow-covered San Gabriel 
Mountains, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The plane is believed to have gone down about 5 p.m. Saturday, but a search 
team, hampered by snow and rain, took more than 16 hours to locate the 
wreckage, said Sgt. Tom Federoff of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were alerted to the crash by signals sent by the downed plane's 
emergency locater and searchers on Sunday morning found the crash site near Mt. 
Baldy. The two women were airlifted to Huntington Memorial Hospital in 
Pasadena, where one of them died at 11:30 a.m., a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The survivor, Jody Pierce, 25, of Santa Barbara, was in serious condition with 
abdominal and chest injuries and a fractured leg, nursing supervisor Judy 
Pruitt said. 
</P>
<P>
Federoff said the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the Civil Air Patrol 
assisted in the rescue operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department could not provide names of the other victims or 
details about the flight.

DANA POINT BECOMES A CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The seaside resort of Dana Point on Sunday officially became Orange County's 
28th city. 
</P>
<P>
During a ceremony aboard a replica of the brig Pilgrim, which carried 
19th-Century author and namesake Richard Henry Dana to what he called "the only 
romantic spot in California," Dana Point's City Council was sworn in and 
Councilwoman Judy Curreri was voted temporary mayor by her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
In a referendum June 7, three-quarters of the voters approved cityhood for the 
community of 26,000 between San Clemente and Laguna Beach. The new city 
includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the 350-room Dana Point Resort and 
the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach resort, which are expected to yield 
millions of dollars in hotel bed taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A consultant estimated that first-year revenues would be about $9 million -- 
more than enough to provide existing services. 
</P>
<P>
A cannon blast -- actually, a 12-gauge shotgun blank -- commemorated the birth 
of the municipality Sunday as a red Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol boat 
chugged up the channel toward the ship, its sirens wailing and five jets of 
water spraying high.

The leader of Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the outlawed Irish 
Republican Army, criticized the IRA for killing civilians in a string of 
botched attacks in Northern Ireland in 1988. "I think the onus is on the IRA to 
safeguard the civilians from injury and death," Gerry Adams said in Belfast. In 
its traditional New Year message, the IRA conceded last week that 1988 had been 
a difficult year with many of its guerrillas killed and several attacks 
bungled. Among the victims killed in IRA bomb attacks intended for other 
targets were a family of three returning from a U.S. vacation, two men near a 
swimming pool and an elderly man and his granddaughter who were outside an 
unmanned police station.

Hundreds of dead birds found along a three-quarter mile stretch of country road 
near Austin, Tex., may have been poisoned by a pesticide or other chemical, a 
biologist said. Area residents first noticed the dead birds Saturday. Hundreds 
of birds were visible from the road, flapping on the ground or dangling from 
tree limbs. Hundreds more were dead in fields. The types included brown-headed 
cowbirds, Brewer's blackbirds, redwing blackbirds, Eastern meadowlarks, 
mourning doves, killdeer and a marsh hawk that died after feeding on a dying 
cowbird. Jack Ralph, a contaminants biologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife 
Department, said he suspected poisoning, possibly from a type of herbicide, 
pesticide or related toxin. "As yet, we can't determine whether this is a 
natural or man-made event," Ralph said. He gathered several birds for 
laboratory analysis and said test results will be available in about a week.

House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) said higher taxes probably will 
be part of a bipartisan compromise budget plan in 1989. Michel said he does not 
believe that spending can be cut enough to meet deficit limits set by law. "I 
don't know that there is that much flexibility," he said. "I suspect (tax 
increases) may be part of the answer." Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), on the other hand, said he takes at face value President-elect George 
Bush's stated opposition to a tax hike. Dole said: "I didn't coin the phrase 
'read my lips,' but I think (Bush) means it and I don't see any give in that 
area at this point." Michel and Dole were guests on ABC-TV's "This Week With 
David Brinkley."

A fire swept through a home north of Remer, Minn., killing eight children and 
two adults who were baby-sitting, authorities said. The fire spread so quickly 
it was unlikely that anyone woke up before being overcome by smoke, Remer Fire 
Chief Leo Renn said. The bodies were found still on the couches or beds where 
they were sleeping, he said. The victims in the two-story wooden home included 
four children of the owners, John Watson and his wife, Nancy, who were not at 
home. The names of the victims were not immediately released. Renn said a 
wood-burning stove and a fuel-oil space heater were being investigated as 
possible causes. In Anchorage, Alaska, two adults and two children died in an 
early morning blaze in a trailer house. They were not immediately identified.

Members of a small Oakland church have bought a neighboring motel plagued with 
prostitution and drug dealing and plan to reopen it as a low-cost apartment 
house. The Rev. George Epps, pastor of the Greater Emmanuel Missionary Baptist 
Church, said a nonprofit corporation formed by the church paid $550,000 for the 
property with the help of a redevelopment loan from the city. "We saw this as a 
great opportunity to try to get in there and make a change," Epps said. The 
300-member congregation plans to first overhaul the motel's 22 units.

Politics and sex, the mix that has rocked Greek theater for 2,400 years, is 
finding new life in satirical shows that mock Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
and his relationship with a former flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
Greeks are packing the capital's theaters to laugh at satires of the 
69-year-old Socialist premier, who is carrying on a public relationship with 
34-year-old Dimitra Liani while his governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement is 
besieged by financial scandals. 
</P>
<P>
Public affairs -- sexual and political -- have been favorite topics for Greek 
comedians since the playwright Aristophanes made the combination a smash hit in 
the 5th Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
Papandreou's heart operation in London last September inspired the title of a 
popular revue, "Post-Aorta Greece," written and directed by Lakis Lazopoulos, 
Greece's top satirist. 
</P>
<P>
Lazopoulos asks innocently at each show: "If a newcomer to Athens saw Andreas 
and Dimitra walking and holding hands, what would he think?" 
</P>
<P>
"That there's a nice girl helping an old man cross the street," comes the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the Vembo Theater a giant poster of Papandreou and Liani embracing 
advertises "Little Dimitra's Sweetheart," a take-off of a classic Greek 
folklore play, "The Little Shepherdess's Sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
In the show, an Athens housewife is asked whether the prime minister's 
pre-election pledges of political and social change have been fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
"Andreas has made one change OK. He changed his American woman for a Greek," 
she answers as the audience breaks into enthusiastic applause. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Papandreou said he will divorce his 66-year-old American-born 
wife Margaret, but no proceedings have yet been started. The blonde Liani has 
been divorced twice. 
</P>
<P>
Six political revues are playing over the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
According to box-office figures, the shows are grossing up to $37,500 a week, 
twice as much as the most successful drama in Athens.

 What job hazard might a baker, dentist and bartender share? Exposure to 
allergens that make them sneeze, wheeze or break out in a rash. 
</P>
<P>
When choosing careers, few people consider whether they may be allergic to 
materials found at the workplace. But many on-the-job substances -- ranging 
from rubber gloves to celery -- can trigger allergic reactions that make 
workers' lives uncomfortable, if not downright miserable. 
</P>
<P>
"Work-related allergies are often misdiagnosed. Only in the last 10 years have 
they started to be taken seriously," Dr. Robert Adams, a dermatology professor 
at Stanford University, said at a recent seminar. 
</P>
<P>
Among the workers at particular risk for developing job-linked allergies are 
bakers. The problem is so widespread that wheezing caused by allergic reactions 
to flour and other baking ingredients has been dubbed "baker's asthma." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to breathing difficulties, Adams said, bakers may develop skin 
rashes from exposure to dough, molasses, preservatives and certain flavorings 
and spices, particularly cinnamon. 
</P>
<P>
Although not all skin problems stem from allergies, many do. That is 
significant in light of federal findings that skin disorders account for a 
third of all cases of chronic occupational disease. The annual cost of lost 
work time, medical care and disability payments related to skin disorders is 
estimated to be at least $222 million. 
</P>
<P>
Bartenders often are plagued by the allergic skin reactions "extremely common 
among people who do wet work," Adams said. Possible allergens for those who 
earn their living mixing drinks are lemon juice, aromatic bitters, glass 
cleaner and rubber gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber gloves are an allergy source for a wide variety of workers, including 
doctors, dentists, butchers, dairymen and kitchen employees. The threat of 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome and hepatitis has also prompted paramedics, 
firefighters and police officers to don gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"A common reaction (to rubber gloves) is a hive-like condition on the hands 
known as contact urticaria, which causes severe itching," said Adams, noting 
that hypo-allergenic and plastic gloves are available for people sensitive to 
chemicals in regular gloves. 
</P>
<P>
Even people who work in office environments cannot evade job-related allergies. 
</P>
<P>
University of Iowa doctors recently reported cases of clerical workers 
developing potentially life-threatening allergic reactions to carbonless copy 
paper. The researchers found that the resin used in such paper can trigger 
rashes, shortness of breath and swelling of the throat. 
</P>
<P>
Allergens also lurk in the florist's shop. The American Academy of Dermatology 
reports that alstroemeria, a bell-shaped flower commonly used in arrangements 
because it stays fresh so long, can cause severe, disabling skin reactions in 
floral workers. The ever-popular primrose can also cause rashes.

A test that tells a woman when she can have sex without using artificial birth 
control to avoid pregnancy has been developed by a biotechnology company that 
said it will be at least a year before it gains regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
Monoclonal Antibodies of Mountain View, Calif., has released details about the 
test, which it said provides valid results only during the second half of a 
woman's monthly cycle, after ovulation. 
</P>
<P>
The test, which Monoclonal said will sell for $3 to $5 per test when it is 
eventually marketed, measures progesterone levels to tell women when ovulation 
has happened. When the hormone level is high, it indicates that ovulation has 
taken place and conception is no longer possible. The test involves putting a 
spot of urine on a pad. If the progesterone level is high, the sample shows no 
color. If the test sample turns blue, a woman would be liable to become 
pregnant.

TREATMENT EFFECTIVE AGAINST BREAST CANCER

<P>
The combined results of 61 studies involving nearly 29,000 women establish 
"beyond reasonable doubt" that drug and hormone treatment after surgery can 
save the lives of many victims of early breast cancer, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
The analysis shows that during the five years after treatment begins, a 
synthetic hormone called tamoxifen reduces the odds of death among older women 
by about one-fifth. For women under age 50, a combination of chemotherapy drugs 
reduces the odds by about one-quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. I. Craig Henderson of the Dana-Farber Cancer Center in Boston, one of 79 
co-authors of the report last week's New England Journal of Medicine, said that 
the treatments do not necessarily cure these women but "substantially delay 
death." 
</P>
<P>
National Institutes of Health recommended in 1985 that tamoxifen and 
chemotherapy be used for breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes. In 
May, 1988, the National Cancer Institute told doctors that this treatment could 
be extended to women in the earliest stages of breast cancer that is not yet 
evident in the lymph nodes. The institute based its recommendation on three 
unpublished studies showing that cancer was slower to return when these women 
were treated after surgery.

In an effort to allay public fear that medical residents are working too many 
hours and providing inadequate patient care in hospitals, an ad hoc committee 
organized by the University of California has recommended that the state's five 
public and three private medical schools restrict doctors in training to no 
more than 84 hours of work per week. The recommendations are in stark contrast 
to current practices of allowing young physicians, particularly obstetricians 
and surgeons, to work round the clock without sleep for upwards of 90 or 100 
hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
The California plan for reform, however, is in keeping with those of a number 
of other efforts around the country to make medical residency training less 
stressful and to improve hospital care of patients. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for California, and one the UC committee did not address, is how to 
pay for the additional personnel that would be needed to implement such a plan. 
According to the committee's own estimates, to replace residents with 
additional residents, nurses, or trained physicians could cost anywhere from 
$26 million to $190 million a year.

THIRD-AND-1 GAMBLE LEAVES HOUSTON AT A LOSS, 17-10

<P>
What Napoleon learned in Russia, another macho little general named Jerry 
Glanville learned again on the steppes of the Niagara Frontier: 
</P>
<P>
It's tough out here in winter. 
</P>
<P>
Where was the old Oiler fire? 
</P>
<P>
Those high elbows? 
</P>
<P>
Those late hits? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that twin bill they just split on the tundra of Cleveland took it out of 
them? At any rate, it was a subdued Oiler team that showed up here Sunday and 
lost, 17-10, to the Bills in a ho-hum American Football Conference semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills advance to next week's AFC final at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers? Once again, they're the contender that came in from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately a very good football team isn't going to play anymore," said 
Glanville, his voice little more than a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, his very good football team lost a late season game at home to 
the Pittsburgh Steelers, blew a 23-7 lead at Cleveland in the regular-season 
finale and lost its chance to welcome the playoffs to the House of Pain. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Oilers upset the Browns last week and were competing on even terms 
Sunday until another of their vintage flourishes backfired. Last season in 
Denver, it was Stagger Lee, the lateral pass they threw into the end zone that 
became a game-turning fumble. Sunday, it was a third-quarter option on third 
and 1 at the Buffalo 2-yard line in a 7-3 game that became a wild pitchout . . 
. and then a missed field-goal try. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," said Glanville softly, "we felt it would score. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent a guy in motion, they followed him and they had one guy to take two. 
That's what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
The question, as always, remains, if the Oilers are so big and talented, why 
not just forget about the tricks and play football? 
</P>
<P>
"The option has been very good for us," Glanville said. "It's what we do down 
there. It's how we score." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, well, win some, lose some. The Oilers played last week, and the Bills 
rested . . . and plotted. 
</P>
<P>
Had the Bills been going backward for a month? 
</P>
<P>
Losing three of their last four? 
</P>
<P>
Getting out-rushed in three of their last four? 
</P>
<P>
Sunday -- surprise! -- the arch-conservative Marv Levy let his hamstrung 
prodigy, Jim Kelly, come out firing and Kelly's pulse danced. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills passed on 15 of their first 21 first downs . . . and Kelly went 11 
for 15. 
</P>
<P>
Was Kelly happy, or what? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yeah, definitely," he said. "I was a throwing quarterback coming out of the 
USFL. I love to throw the ball. That's why I'm a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"At times during the season, we ran the ball extremely well, so we didn't throw 
it. Our defense played so well, our offense kind of took a back seat, but we 
were No. 4 in total offense. I think that speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
However, Levy was having a little trouble himself, guessing right on calls near 
the Oiler goal. 
</P>
<P>
It was 0-0 when Kelly talked him into going on fourth and 1 at the Houston 3 in 
the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly threw an incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
Levy and Kelly were going to guess wrong again later, but not before the Bills 
took the lead. Early in the second period, Leonard Smith blocked an Oiler punt 
by Greg Montgomery and the Bills took over at the Oiler 46. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly promptly threw a couple of first-down passes to Trumaine Johnson for 18 
and 9 yards. Then Thurman Thomas broke free over the right side for 16 to the 
Oiler 3. A couple of plays later, Robb Riddick jammed over from the 1 -- after 
Kelly fell down handing off and Riddick bobbled the ball and guard Jim Ritcher 
blocked Eugene Seale, who had stacked up Riddick at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills were still clinging to a 7-3 lead when Kelly came out firing in the 
second half . . . and drilled one into the chest of Oiler nickel back Tracey 
Eaton at the Buffalo 47. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, the Oilers were at the Buffalo 2, with third and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Where to run? 
</P>
<P>
Off the left side behind 320-pound Bruce Davis and Pro Bowl choice Mike 
Munchak? 
</P>
<P>
Off the right behind Pro Bowl selection Bruce Matthews and blue-chip No. 1 pick 
Dean Steinkuhler? 
</P>
<P>
How about around right end, where quarterback Warren Moon would have to make a 
read, risk injury if he turned it up, or get the ball out to his trailing back, 
Mike Rozier? 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers chose the option. Moon may have made a bad read, and he certainly 
made a bad pitchout. Rozier never touched it, and it rolled over the sideline 
for a 12-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Zendejas then came out to try a 31-yard field goal . . . and duck-hooked 
it, and the Oilers had nothing to show for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
"It kinda slipped out of my hand and got away from me," Moon said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of either me taking it into the end zone or Mike. I'm not 
sure, they said from upstairs that I might have made it myself. I didn't think 
I could." 
</P>
<P>
Why not run straight ahead? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I've got 5 TDs running the option this year," Moon said, "and our backs 
have scored more. We're going to do the things that got us here. We can't throw 
it out now." 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers use a lot of the old USFL: Houston Gamblers/Jim Kelly/Mouse Davis 
run 'n' shoot, and the option, too, which may be imaginative of them. The 
argument against the latter, on the pro level, is that defenses will try to 
take out your quarterback, and if they do, it won't be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Moon threw for 195 yards in the first half, and 45 in the second. Why? 
He had come into the game with a sore right elbow and injured it again -- 
running an option. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just say that when Zendejas missed, the air went out of the Oilers with a 
whoosh you could hear on the Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Each defense held twice. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills then put together a 59-yard drive, including Kelly's first-down pass 
to Chris Burkett for 26 yards, and a third-down Kelly scramble with a face-mask 
penalty against ex-Raider Sean Jones tacked on. Thomas bolted the last 11 yards 
off the right side, and it was 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been 17-3 early in the fourth period after Kelly completed a 
53-yard pass play to Andre Reed. However, Kelly talked Levy into trying to go 
again on fourth and 1 at the 1, and Riddick was thrown back, again. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, it's the playoffs, let's go for it," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
"I said that to him twice, and we came up short twice. The second time, I 
apologized to him." 
</P>
<P>
They didn't have to worry, this wasn't the Oilers' day. Moon promptly threw an 
interception to Mark Kelso, who returned it 28 yards to the Houston 18. 
</P>
<P>
This time, when the Bills got to fourth and 1 at the Houston 9, Levy sent out 
his field goal unit. Scott Norwood kicked the 27-yarder and it was, finally, 
17-3. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Oilers have anything left? Moon took them 80 yards, completing passes 
for 65 yards of the drive. Rozier ran straight ahead this time and went over 
from the 1 with 5:12 left, making it 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers even got the ball back . . . briefly. 
</P>
<P>
They forced a punt, but Curtis Duncan came running up to field a line drive by 
John Kidd, bobbled the ball, went to one knee, got up and tried to run before 
he was hit by ex-Oiler Steve Tasker and fumbled the ball to the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills ran out the clock as the fans sang and threw their last snowballs at 
the Oilers and the police on horseback, 22 years of pent-up yearnings fulfilled 
at last. The Bills hadn't played a home playoff game since 1966, when the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development-designate, Jack Kemp, who was 
watching upstairs, was the quarterback, and they were teeing it up in a 
downtown pile of bricks called War Memorial Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerry Glanville's heart, it may have been wintertime, but it's summer in 
Buffalo.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A year after suffering his most painful pull outside of a dentist's office, 
quarterback Joe Montana was removed from the starting lineup again Sunday, sent 
to the bench with 8 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Same place, same playoff opponent, same stakes. But hardly the same ol' Joe. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the 32-year-old Montana left as conquering hero, having played a 
game with the hunger of a man who hadn't thrown a playoff touchdown pass in 4 
years. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Montana hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
But those ghosts, along with others, were finally purged from the souls of the 
San Francisco 49ers, who snapped a 3-year, first-game playoff losing streak 
with a 34-9 win over the Minnesota Vikings to advance to next week's NFC title 
game against the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, who would throw his first postseason scoring pass since Super Bowl 
XIX, played brilliantly early and made it stand up. Montana finished with 
scoring passes of 2, 4 and 11 yards -- all to receiver Jerry Rice, all in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
A more complete reversal of last season's loss to the Vikings is difficult to 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
It was here at Candlestick Park that Montana was breaded and deep fried in a 
playoff loss a season ago, a humbling performance that led to his second-half 
benching and the dawning of a new-age quarterback controversy with Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, before a crowd of 61,848, Montana left the game only after his work was 
done, his good name and a game's outcome having long been satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not that the 49ers were sensitive about their little run of bad luck 
in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"The past 3 years have been glorious years," Coach Bill Walsh said, responding 
to a pointed question afterward. "I don't know where you're from. We've been to 
the playoffs every year. We haven't won the Super Bowl in 4 years. People will 
look at the negative side about that. But what other team has done more than we 
have? We have no apologies for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Especially not after Sunday, when the 49ers reversed virtually every trend from 
last season's Vikings loss. 
</P>
<P>
None was more important than the elimination of Anthony Carter from the 
Vikings' game plan. Last time, Carter cut through the 49er secondary for a 
playoff-record 227 yards with 10 catches. Sunday, Carter did not have ball 
thrown his direction in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
He made his first catch with 13:21 left in the third quarter and finished with 
3 catches for 45 yards. Viking quarterback Wade Wilson threw Carter's way just 
5 times all day. 
</P>
<P>
Cornerback Tim McKyer, who admitted he and the boys did a pretty nice 
double-coverage blanket job on Carter, still couldn't believe the Vikings 
didn't take a chance on their home-run king. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what their game plan was," McKyer said. "But I know if I was the 
coach, I would throw him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, for example, don't seem to mind how many people are covering Rice. 
Great receivers make great catches, they figure. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, of course, has been through this before with his coaching staff and 
wasn't pleased with his snubbing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Viking Coach Jerry Burns said the 49ers' heavy pass rush and double coverage 
took Carter out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do anything differently," Burns snapped later. "They just did it a 
hell of a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
Carter basically said that Burns took him out of the game. And for Carter, 
those lonely pass routes were tough pills to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
Double coverage? 
</P>
<P>
"That's not what I saw," he said. "I saw a lot of zone. They just didn't call 
my number." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Viking coaches can reach Carter at home. 
</P>
<P>
It was true, though, the 49ers' defensive front put an excessive amount of heat 
on Wilson, who sometimes had trouble getting the ball out of his own hand, let 
alone to his receivers. Wilson was sacked 6 times on the day for minus-47 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if we didn't sack him today, we wanted to be in his face and get a hand 
up," 49er defensive end Larry Roberts said. "By keeping a lot of pressure on 
Wilson and playing AC (Carter) up tight, we knew we pretty much had them where 
we wanted them." 
</P>
<P>
And that, of course, was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
On the flip side, San Francisco's offensive line protected Montana well, much 
better than last season when the Vikings sacked him 4 times. Sunday, Montana 
was sacked once. 
</P>
<P>
Against the likes of Keith Millard and Chris Doleman and the rest of 
Minnesota's No. 1-ranked defense, that was big news. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line had a great day," Montana said. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Millard, twice called for offsides, grew more frustrated as 
the day wore on. After Roger Craig's 4-yard run put the 49ers up, 28-9, with 
13:41 left, Millard sauntered over and took a shot at Montana's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, certainly not foolish enough to exchange blows, instead wagged his 
finger at Millard as he ran off the field. Millard, of course, wagged back. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just the heat-of-the-moment-type thing," Montana said. "I was just 
congratulating my offensive line and got an elbow across my face." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Millard's face was stained only with egg. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, whose mobility this season has been hampered by various injuries, 
seemed strong and sharp Sunday, especially in the first half, when he completed 
11 of 14 passes for 111 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Things might have been worse had the Vikings not squandered a nice 6-minute, 
12-play drive on their opening drive, settling for a 47-yard Chuck Nelson field 
goal. Minnesota's only lead of the day, 3-0, would last just minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Montana drove the 49ers 48 yards late in the quarter before finding Rice open 
for a 2-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
Nine seconds later, 49er safety Ronnie Lott intercepted a Wilson pass intended 
for Darrin Nelson, returning it 5 yards to the Minnesota 30. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-yard reverse run by Rice took it down to the 9, setting up a 4-yard 
touchdown pass play, Montana to Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the half, after the 49ers had driven 59 yards down to the 11, Montana 
faked right and looked left to Rice, who froze Viking corner Reggie Rutland 
with an inside move. Rice went outside. Touchdown and 21-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings only made a game of it twice. On their first possession of the 
third quarter, they finally discovered Carter hit him twice on pass plays of 21 
and 14 yards to set up a 5-yard scoring pass from Wilson to Hassan Jones. 
Nelson missed the extra point, cutting the lead to 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
The play that turned the game came with 2:26 left in the third quarter. 
Rutland, anticipating a Montana pass to Rice in the left flat, cut in front of 
the receiver at his own 40 and seemed in perfect position to make the 
interception and take it 60 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"We both had the ball in our hands," Rutland said, describing the play. "We 
came down with it." 
</P>
<P>
The ball, in fact, went past Rutland's fingertips into the hands of Rice, who 
turned it into a 28-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
In last season's game, Rutland took a similar gamble and returned a Montana 
interception 45 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
As Rutland would say, there were many things different about this game. 
</P>
<P>
"It could have went either way," Rutland said. "In another situation, it might 
have been different. I'd play it the same way each time. I'd just come down 
with it each time." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a 21-16 game, Rice's catch set up the touchdown that put the 49ers 
up, 28-9. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig removed all comeback doubts when he turned a simple pitch into an 
80-yard touchdown run with 9:04 left. It was the longest run of Craig's career 
and the longest day in recent Viking memory. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, that run was by design," Walsh said of Craig's run. "It 
broke like we had hoped. But after the first 5 yards, it was all Roger." 
</P>
<P>
Craig, who had been mostly frustrated until his big run, finished with 135 
yards in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Young replaced Montana with 7:46 remaining. Redemption was sweet, Montana would 
say. And complete.

THE BOWL GAMES;

ROSE BOWL; 
</P>
<P>
SCHEMBECHLER COULD USE LAST LAUGH AGAINST USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler is reminded of his 1-7 record in the 
Rose Bowl, which is often, he jokes about it. 
</P>
<P>
It's a logical response, because he can't do anything now about what has 
happened in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his lighthearted comments, Schembechler would like to start 
chipping away at his record by beating USC today in the 75th renewal of the 
Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach Larry Smith doesn't have such skeletons rattling in his coaching 
closet. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, there is a certain urgency for Smith to win today's game, 
considering that his Trojans lost to Michigan State in last year's Rose Bowl 
game in his first appearance as a head coach. It would also take some of the 
sting out of a regular-season ending loss to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
That defeat ranks as one of the most disappointing in 100 years of USC 
football. If USC (10-1) had won, it would be defending a No. 1 ranking in 
college football against Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
USC quarterback Rodney Peete has said that it will be a long time before that 
defeat is little more than a memory. 
</P>
<P>
So how will the Trojans respond? Smith isn't sure. "We won't know until we come 
out on the field. We haven't been able to judge ourselves in that situation 
because it's the first time we've come off a loss this season," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Michigan (8-2-1), the Wolverines could be a national championship 
contender today if it weren't for early season losses to Notre Dame and Miami 
by a total of 3 points. 
</P>
<P>
Much has been written that the USC-Michigan matchup is a secondary bowl game, 
inasmuch as No. 1-ranked Notre Dame and No. 3 West Virginia will be playing for 
the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Schembechler and Smith contend that the "Granddaddy of them 
all," the Rose Bowl, doesn't take a back seat in viewing interest to any bowl. 
Subsequent television ratings will provide more insight. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, today's Rose Bowl game has its intrinsic interest -- 
Schembechler's albatross-like record along with the Big Ten's failure here in 
recent years, losing 12 of the past 14 Rose Bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there's the relationship between the coaches. Smith got his coaching 
start as a member of Schembechler's staff at Miami of Ohio and Michigan in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
They've been friends ever since, and Smith attributes much of his coaching 
philosophy to his early apprenticeship under Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Smith has lost only 5 games and won 18 in 2 seasons at USC. In those losses, 
Trojan turnovers were decisive. Smith says they will be a key factor today. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan isn't likely to oblige, considering that quarterbacks Michael Taylor 
and Demetrius Brown have thrown only 2 interceptions and have lost only 8 
fumbles the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of the Notre Dame game when USC had 4 turnovers, the 
Trojans haven't been error-prone. 
</P>
<P>
Peete has thrown 10 interceptions, but that's misleading, considering his 
entire offensive output. He has completed 208 of 338 passes (61.5%) for an 
average of 241.3 yards a game and 18 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Michigan's quarterbacks have attempted only 191 passes. The 
Wolverines are primarily a running team, featuring tailback Tony Boles and 
fullback Leroy Hoard, who are each averaging 5.5 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
"Michigan will not be taken out of its running game," Smith said. "They're 
better at it than any team we've played." 
</P>
<P>
However, the Wolverines may be forced to pass more often than in previous games 
considering the Trojans are No. 2-ranked nationally in rushing defense, 
allowing an average of only 76.6 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
USC has a more balanced offense, averaging 214.6 yards running and 247 yards 
passing compared with 256.6 and 153.4 for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have what Smith calls bend-but-not-break defenses. Michigan features 
one of the nation's best defensive linemen in tackle Mark Messner. 
</P>
<P>
However, Peete, who placed second to Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders in the 
Heisman Trophy voting, seemingly provides USC with an edge in an otherwise even 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
Brown became the starting quarterback when Taylor suffered a broken collarbone 
in the ninth game of the season against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Brown had 16 interceptions last season, a factor in losing his starting job to 
Taylor. However, he hasn't been intercepted since replacing Taylor, completing 
61.7% of his passes for 5 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
It's Brown's show today as Taylor was recently hospitalized with the flu and 
isn't expected to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are aware of Peete's capabilities. Said Messner: "He's very, 
very fast and he can beat you single-handedly." 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had some success blitzing Peete in a 27-10 victory, and it wouldn't 
be surprising if Michigan uses the same tactic. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines don't seem to be up-tight, perhaps reflecting the mood of their 
coach, who has been accommodating and apparently relaxed since the team's 
arrival here. 
</P>
<P>
As for his 1-7 Rose Bowl record, Schembechler, who has won more games than any 
other active college coach, dismisses it by saying: 
</P>
<P>
"If you win all the time, maybe you don't have as much appreciation for it. The 
thing that has balanced out my career is the fact I haven't been as successful 
in bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the same record I had in bowls as I do in the regular season, I'd 
probably be too cocky and have too big an ego." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff for today's game is 2 p.m. A crowd of 95,000 to 100,000 is expected. . 
. . USC is a 6 1/2-point favorite. Even though Aaron Emanuel has been USC's 
most productive tailback in recent games, Coach Larry Smith said that Ricky 
Ervins would start today. "He has had excellent practices," Smith said of 
Ervins, "but all of our tailbacks will play." He was mainly referring to 
Ervins, Emanuel and Scott Lockwood. Smith would also like to use Steven Webster 
if possible. Webster, a senior, has missed virtually the entire season with 
injuries. . . . Michigan's Wilbur Odom, a sophomore, who has played in only one 
game, will back up Demetrius Brown at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
USC is ranked fifth in the polls, Michigan 11th. . . . Smith concedes that 
Michigan has an edge over USC in the kicking game. Mike Gillette, a catcher on 
the baseball team, is averaging 40.4 yards on punts. He set a school record 
with his 56-yard field goal against Ohio State. USC punter Chris Sperle is 
averaging 38.3 yards, and Quin Rodriguez made 14 of 19 field goals, 7 for 7 
inside the 30-yard line. . . . Erik Affholter, USC's All-American split end, 
set schools records in the regular season for receptions in a season (63) and 
career (118). Michigan has accomplished wide receivers in Greg McMurtry, Chris 
Calloway and John Kolesar. However, that group has had a total of only 67 
receptions on a run-oriented team. 
</P>
<P>
T.J. Osman, Michigan's middle guard, on Bo Schembechler's overall 4-11 bowl 
record: "He told us before we left that if we got a question about his bowl 
record to answer by saying that it's his record and not anything that we had to 
do with." . . . Asked to comment on Michigan allowing 31 points against Ohio 
State in the second half of a final regular-season game, defensive tackle Mark 
Messner said: "We're still asking what happened. We had the same players and we 
were calling the same defenses, but they were going right through us." Michigan 
won, though, 34-31, on a late, 41-yard pass from Brown to Kolesar. Michigan is 
ranked ninth nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 13.9 points 
a game. . . . USC has a 3-1 record against Michigan in the Rose Bowl and 3-3 
overall. The Trojans have an 18-7 Rose Bowl record. . . . Schembechler has lost 
only one Rose Bowl game by more than 8 points, a 24-14 loss to UCLA in 1983.

BOWL RECORD PROVIDES INCENTIVE FOR UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Unable to beat Washington State to maintain its No. 1 ranking, or to beat USC 
to earn a trip to the Rose Bowl, UCLA can still make 1988 a noteworthy season 
by beating Arkansas today in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Outscoring the eighth-ranked Razorbacks, who were 10-0 before losing their 
regular-season finale to Miami, would give the Bruins bowl victories in seven 
consecutive seasons, a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Terry Donahue has dangled the record as incentive for his ninth-ranked 
Bruins, who were No. 1 for 2 weeks in October before staggering through the 
final month of the season, losing 2 of 4 games to finish 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
"In my eyes now, the fact that the national championship slipped away, the fact 
that we aren't the conference champion, the season is nowhere near as 
successful as I had hoped it would be, based on my expectations as they built 
throughout the season," Donahue said. "The emotions of the moment tell me that 
we've got to win this game or the season's a failure." 
</P>
<P>
And beating Arkansas, Donahue said, will not be easy, in spite of the opinions 
of the oddsmakers, who favor UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a lot of obstacles to overcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Donahue, the Razorbacks have several psychological advantages. 
Donahue seems to say that about every opponent, of course, but in this case he 
seems to harbor legitimate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas has worked toward this day since 1976, when it beat Georgia in its 
last Cotton Bowl appearance, whereas UCLA accepted a bid as the first team from 
the West Coast to appear in the Cotton Bowl since 1949 only as a consolation 
prize after losing a Rose Bowl showdown to USC, 31-22. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas might be inspired by a natural resentment toward UCLA's 
All-American quarterback, Troy Aikman, who has received most of the attention 
from fans and the local media because the Dallas Cowboys are expected to make 
him the No. 1 pick next April in the National Football League draft. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A majority of the fans in the sold-out, 72,032-seat Cotton Bowl stadium 
will wear funny red hats shaped like hogs' heads. Whereas about 35,000 tickets 
to the game were sold in Arkansas, fewer than 3,000 were sold at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arkansas might simply be better than advertised. The Razorbacks, some 
believe, were underrated, never rising above eighth in the national rankings. 
The Southwest Conference champions, in fact, earned more respect from their 
loss to Miami than they did from their 10 victories. And they might have beaten 
the second-ranked Hurricanes if safety Steve Atwater hadn't dropped a potential 
interception in the Arkansas end zone with fewer than 6 minutes to play. 
Miami's Carlos Huerta then kicked a 20-yard field goal with 5:38 left to give 
the Hurricanes an 18-16 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a great opportunity here," Donahue said. "I think the obstacles and 
the barriers for this game are a great deal different and more challenging than 
some we've had in past (bowl) games." 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, though, isn't the only one facing hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Arkansas arrived in Dallas last week, Coach Ken Hatfield had 
suspended, for unspecified reasons, All-Southwest Conference offensive guard 
Freddie Childress and defensive tackle Wayne Martin, an All-American and the 
defensive player of the year in the Southwest Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Neither will play today. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the Razorbacks have had to deal with speculation about Hatfield, who 
reportedly is among the candidates to replace Vince Dooley at Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game, we'll decide about the future," said Hatfield, who has 
sidestepped all questions about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
And the Razorbacks, despite their record, were hardly a dominant team, winning 
6 games by 8 points or less, including a 21-14 victory over 0-11 Rice. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just about one step better than everybody we played and then we got to 
Miami and were about one step behind," Hatfield said. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by quarterback Quinn Grovey, who led the Southwest Conference in 
passing efficiency but passed for only 966 yards and 4 touchdowns, the 
Razorbacks' flexbone attack ranked third in the SWC in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
The Razorbacks also ranked third in total defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA, meanwhile, caught the nation's attention with its 41-28 dismantling of 
Nebraska in September, moved to No. 1 after Notre Dame knocked off Miami in 
October and rolled to a 7-0 start, its best in 22 years, before squandering a 
27-6 third-quarter lead in a 34-30 loss to Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by less-than-impressive victories over Oregon and Stanford, 
in which Aikman endured his least productive games, and the loss to USC, in 
which Aikman was brilliant, throwing for 317 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hatfield said that UCLA was more balanced offensively than Miami and 
called the Bruins "as good a team as there is in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Unless they beat Arkansas, though, their season will be looked upon in some 
circles as a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can view 9-2 as an unsuccessful season, I'm not sure that I'm not as 
guilty as the next person in contributing to the madness," Donahue said. "It 
was a good year, but it just didn't meet all of our expectations." 
</P>
<P>
A victory over the Razorbacks would ease the burden. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cotton Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Of the 4 other schools that won bowl games in 6 consecutive seasons, Georgia 
Tech and Alabama had their streaks ended by Southwest Conference schools. 
Georgia Tech lost to Arkansas, 14-7, in the 1960 Gator Bowl and Alabama lost to 
Texas, 14-12, in the 1982 Cotton Bowl. USC and Nebraska also won bowl games in 
6 straight seasons. . . . In the only meeting between the schools, UCLA and 
Arkansas played to a 10-10 tie in the 1978 Fiesta Bowl. . . . UCLA is listed as 
a 5 1/2-point favorite. . . . The extended forecast called for a cloudy sky 
with temperatures in the low 50s and a 20% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is playing in a bowl game for the eighth consecutive season, the longest 
current string in the Pacific 10 Conference. Its record in bowl games is 8-7-1, 
including a 6-2-1 record under Coach Terry Donahue. . . . Arkansas is 9-12-3 in 
bowl games, including a 1-3 record under Coach Ken Hatfield and a 2-3-1 record 
in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Outside linebacker Eric Smith of UCLA will miss the game with knee and ankle 
injuries, Donahue said Sunday, and will be replaced in the starting lineup by 
Billy Ray. . . . UCLA also will be without inside linebacker Chance Johnson, 
who is out with a knee injury, reserve linebacker Stacy Argo and reserve 
defensive back Randy Beverly. . . . Eric Ball, who has been bothered by an 
ankle injury, will start at tailback and reserve wide receiver David Keating 
might play despite a hamstring injury, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Henry will take the place of suspended right guard Freddie Childress in 
Arkansas' starting lineup, although James Morris will move over from left guard 
to take Childress' regular place in the line. . . . Suspended defensive tackle 
Wayne Martin, who led the Razorbacks with 13 sacks, will be replaced by 
sophomore Tony Ollison. . . . James Rouse, who was Arkansas' leading rusher 
before missing the Razorbacks' last 5 games with a knee injury, is expected to 
play, but will not start.

U.S. International University will try for its second consecutive victory 
tonight, playing host to Vermont in a men's nonconference basketball game at 
7:30 in Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
USIU beat St. Francis (N.Y.), 95-77, Friday for its second victory in 3 games. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont lost, 83-76, to San Diego State Saturday. Vermont (1-5) has lost its 
last 5 games. 
</P>
<P>
Only one senior will start for either team tonight. The Gulls (5-9) have no 
senior starters, while Vermont starts two freshmen and sophomore and junior 
forwards. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont's one senior starter, 6-foot 11-inch center Joe Calavita, is averaging 
16.3 points and 9.6 rebounds and has scored in double figures in 23 consecutive 
games, including 20 Saturday against San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
USIU has started 6-11, 235-pound sophomore Mike Sterner at center. Sterner, 
however, has had his problems this season and is averaging just 4 points and 4 
rebounds. Demetrius Laffitte, a 6-5 forward, leads the team in rebounding with 
10 per game. RICK HAZLETINE

AUBURN, FLORIDA STATE HAVE CORNERS COVERED; 
</P>
<P>
IT'LL BE TIGERS' DEFENSE AGAINST SEMINOLES' OFFENSE IN TONIGHT'S SUGAR BOWL

<P>
For Auburn's Tigers and Florida State's Seminoles, the ifs are these: 
</P>
<P>
If Notre Dame and West Virginia had been upset this season, somewhere along the 
line, and if Miami were to be upset today, Auburn and Florida State could be 
playing for No. 1 tonight in the Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the way they see it, they'll be playing for No. 2, when, at the end of 
a long, 7-game day of football, the fourth-ranked Seminoles and seventh-ranked 
Tigers meet on the Superdome field at 5:30 p.m. (PST). 
</P>
<P>
By then, many sports fans will doubtless be bowled out. But others may still be 
wondering what Deion Sanders is all about. 
</P>
<P>
The pregame star of the 55th Sugar Bowl, Sanders is the fast-talking, 
fast-moving Florida State cornerback who led the nation in punt returns this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think of Florida State, you think of Deion Sanders," Auburn 
quarterback Reggie Slack said Sunday. "He's the guy who gets them their great 
field position (on punt returns). 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing (a passer) looks for is where Deion is. If I'm throwing to his 
side, I have one goal: Get the ball there quick." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is a three-sport star who played in the New York Yankee chain last 
summer shortly after he was named the MVP of the Metro Conference track and 
field meet, where he won at 100 and 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most exciting athlete we've ever had here," Florida State Coach Bobby 
Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Seminoles under Bowden are known for offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't stand a quarterback who's afraid he might throw an interception," 
Bowden said, tipping his game plan. 
</P>
<P>
He added that he also expects a big performance from running back Sammie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Dye's Auburn team, meanwhile, is known for defense. The Tigers led the 
nation this season in total defense, scoring defense and run defense. 
</P>
<P>
"You only do that if you've got quality (players) everywhere, in every 
position," said Auburn's All-American defensive tackle Tracy Rocker, the winner 
this season of both the Outland and Lombardi trophies. 
</P>
<P>
Florida State quarterback Chip Ferguson said: "People say this game is our 
offense against their defensive team. (But) I'm not so sure about that. I've 
seen our defense. It's terrific." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, working with four receivers who alternate by pairs, had a big season, 
leading the Seminoles to 10 straight victories after their stunning 31-0 defeat 
on opening day at Miami (Fla). 
</P>
<P>
Going into the Miami game, Florida State was No. 1 in the polls that Notre Dame 
leads today. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't in the right frame of mind (for Miami)," Bowden said. "We were 
highly overconfident -- I was overconfident myself. 
</P>
<P>
"We had outplayed (Miami) the year before, and lost by 1 point. We had most of 
our team back, and they were remaking theirs. We had been practicing very well 
-- and they walloped us." 
</P>
<P>
Other Seminoles suggested that Miami may have broken Florida State's audible 
code that day. 
</P>
<P>
"They read us like a book," one Florida State coach said. 
</P>
<P>
Said a Florida State offensive tackle, Joey Ionata, "Every time we called an 
audible, (Miami) shifted right into the hole." 
</P>
<P>
But it's all over now, and, said Bowden, "The rest of the season has proved how 
good we really were then -- and are now." 
</P>
<P>
It has also proved how good Auburn is. Under Dye, whose team shared the 
Southeastern Conference title this season with LSU, the Tigers have made seven 
straight bowl trips. 
</P>
<P>
They've been one of the four biggest winners in college football the last 6 
years, winning 80% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never had a better defensive player than Tracy Rocker," Dye said. "And 
the rest of our defense is about as experienced as you can get. We have two or 
three great (defensive) players, and seven or eight others who are playing at 
the top of their game." 
</P>
<P>
Dye was asked what it would take today to make him identify Auburn as his 
best-ever team. 
</P>
<P>
"It wouldn't take (more than) just a win," he said.

FORD SAYS OKLAHOMA TO PROVIDE TEST FOR CLEMSON

During the 1980s, Clemson has won 5 Atlantic Coast Conference championships and 
1 national title. During that span, Oklahoma has won 5 Big Eight championship 
and 1 national title. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 9-2 entering today's Citrus Bowl game. Clemson is ranked 13th, 
Oklahoma 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Clemson Coach Danny Ford believes this game represents a measuring stick 
of sorts for his team. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anxious to play the University of Oklahoma because of their tradition," 
Ford said. "We want to play and see where we are. We know where Oklahoma is. 
They're there every year." 
</P>
<P>
Where Oklahoma is going is on probation. The received National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. sanctions 2 weeks ago, and this will be the Sooners last bowl 
game for at least 2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer said the sanctions would have no effect on the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"That won't be an excuse," he said. "Clemson will have more to do with it than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, Ford and his players have described the Sooners in glowing 
terms. Switzer, for one, doesn't believe the praise is deserved. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a good college football team, but we're not anywhere near what we have 
been before," Switzer said, alluding to the teams that went 11-1 in each of the 
past 3 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson, who lost to Florida State and North Carolina State, comes into the 
Citrus Bowl with a 4-game winning streak. The Tigers scored at least 29 points 
in each of those games. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Williams directed an I-formation offense that averaged 397 yards per 
game, the best in Ford's 10 seasons as coach. The senior quarterback, who has 
been named most valuable player in both of his bowl games, doesn't throw often 
or well, but he does win. His 31-10-2 record makes him the winningest starter 
in ACC history. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Williams doesn't throw much is tailback Terry Allen, who became the 
first Clemson sophomore to rush for more than 1,000 yards when he ran for 1,139 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson prefers to keep the ball on the ground, although Williams burned Penn 
State for 214 passing yards in a 35-10 Fiesta Bowl victory last year. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma finished fourth nationally with an average of 343 yards rushing per 
game. However, that was accomplished mostly on artificial turf and with Charles 
Thompson at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
When the Sooners take to the grass field of the Citrus Bowl, gimpy-legged 
Jamelle Holieway will be the quarterback in his final collegiate game.

TURNOVERS MIGHT PROVE COSTLY TO LSU, SYRACUSE

Coaches from Louisiana State and Syracuse, today's opponents in the Hall of 
Fame Bowl, see little difference between their teams. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have two teams as evenly matched as we are, the game is going to be 
decided by turnovers and big plays," said LSU Coach Mike Archer, whose Tigers 
will take an 8-3 record and one of the Southeastern Conference's best passing 
attacks into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"The game is not going to be decided by whether they throw the ball well or 
not. We expect them to throw it well," said Syracuse Coach Dick MacPherson, who 
starts 5 fifth-year seniors in a secondary that hasn't given up a touchdown 
pass in 38 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the game will be decided by whoever plays the hardest, the cleanest, 
and has no turnovers, because we're both excellent football teams." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (9-2) is ranked 17th going into the second-ever meeting between the 
schools. LSU, a 13-10 winner over the Orangemen in the 1965 Sugar Bowl, is No. 
16 and a slight underdog despite being co-champions of the SEC in Archer's 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident, we know all about the SEC, and it's a great conference," 
Syracuse quarterback Todd Philcox said. "But we played one of their teams last 
year and did pretty well. We're not in awe." 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen, 11-0 during the 1987 regular season, tied Auburn, 16-16, in last 
year's Sugar Bowl when the Tigers settled for a game-tying field goal with 1 
second left. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Orangemen won 8 of their last 9 after a 26-9 loss to Ohio 
State. The other defeat came at West Virginia, 31-9, Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
LSU also finished strongly after losing to Ohio State (36-33) and Florida 
(19-6). The Tigers began a 5-game winning streak with a 7-6 victory over Auburn 
and closed with a 30-point rout of Tulane after losing to Miami, 44-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen will play without junior running back Michael Owens, the team's 
third-leading rusher with 460 yards. MacPherson suspended him for a "repeated 
breach of team guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
All-American safety Markus Paul leads a Syracuse defense, which will try to 
stop quarterback Tommy Hodson, a 52% passer who threw for 2,074 yards and 13 
touchdowns to carry LSU after preseason knee injuries sidelined running back 
Harvey Williams and wide receiver Todd Kinchen.

AFTER SUFFERING HEART ATTACK, LEE ELDER NOW ON COURSE ON SENIOR TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Elder is the surprise entry in the senior division of the Tournament of 
Champions, which ushers in the professional golf season beginning Thursday at 
La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen months ago, Elder had no intention of playing in this tournament. He 
was in a hospital fighting for his life. 
</P>
<P>
Only tournament winners qualify for the opening tournament of the season. Elder 
climaxed an extraordinary comeback by winning the Gus Machado tournament in 
late November. His 6 under 65 on the last round enabled him to win by 5 shots 
with a 54-hole total of 202. He had made it back almost a year to the day after 
suffering a heart attack that threatened his life. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing ninth in the Gus Machado at Key Biscayne, Fla. Nov. 22, 1987, 
Elder became ill. He had been on a busy schedule in October and November, 
flying coast-to-coast twice and to Japan, competing in tournaments every week. 
He had complained of back and side pains during the tournament, wearing a brace 
for the last round after leading the first round. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably was worn out, but I thought it was a back problem," Elder recalled. 
"I never thought about a heart attack. Something like that couldn't happen to 
Lee Elder. But it did. By 10 that night I was in terrible pain. I had to go to 
the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Elder was in the intensive care heart unit for 5 days and remained in the 
hospital another 9 days. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctor told me that only extensive tests would determine whether I would 
ever play golf again," said Elder, who arrived early in Southern California to 
practice for the tournament. "It was frightening. I was only 53 and golf was my 
life. I didn't know anything else. There was a chance I would wind up like 
Arthur Ashe, unable to compete again. 
</P>
<P>
"As it turned out, I was lucky. There was only a small tear in the heart. Tests 
indicated there was very little blockage of the arteries. The doctor said being 
a golfer, being outside so much and walking, probably kept me from having a 
much more severe attack. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten days after going to the hospital, my doctor came into the room and said, 
'I have some very good news for you. You will be able to play again. It's your 
choice. You had a stress cholesterol attack. Rest, time, no stress and 
rehabilitation are the answer. It's up to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
It meant a complete change in life style. He had to give up smoking, decrease 
his drinking, go on a low cholesterol diet and take cardiovascular treatment 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been a heart attack waiting to happen," he said. "I smoked two or three 
packs of cigarettes a day and I had been drinking heavily. I had very high 
cholesterol and wore myself out physically with all that traveling. I ate the 
worst possible foods, eggs, fatty meats and lots of it. I let myself get fat. 
In addition, I kept my anger inside of me, under control on the course. I 
wanted to keep up an image. Of course, there were times in the clubhouse when I 
blew my top. I would throw the offending club -- it's always the club's fault 
-- around the locker room after a poor round. 
</P>
<P>
"I was determined to follow orders and continue my career. Quitting smoking was 
easy. I couldn't smoke during the 14 days in the hospital. The diet and the 
drinking, except for the holidays, were not too tough, either. I'm on a 1,700 
calories per day diet and I haven't had an egg in more than a year. I go to the 
cardiovascular treatment center every day and I walk at least 2 miles." 
</P>
<P>
When the doctor told Elder he could start chipping in January, Elder said he 
wanted to play in the Senior PGA, which is played near his Palm Beach Gardens, 
Fla. home, and started Feb. 10. He was told he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"But, he told me I could start swinging a club Jan. 20," Elder said. "He told 
me it would probably hurt at first. I was to stop, take a nitroglycerin pill 
and try again. It never did hurt at all. The first few days I was afraid to 
swing hard, but when I finally did, it still didn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started hitting golf balls, it was like hitting into a three-club wind. 
I had no strength. It wasn't that difficult to adjust, especially with the 
irons. I have always been a good iron player." 
</P>
<P>
Elder, to the surprise of his doctor, played in the Senior PGA. He amazed 
everyone by shooting a 70 in the first round. Although he faded somewhat, he 
still earned $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I still had a long way to go," he said. "Probably a year. At first, I 
would play a tournament and rest one week. In warm weather I could play two in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
"Guys I used to outdrive were now hitting the ball farther than I could. I 
wanted to do some weightlifting to regain my strength, but the doctor wouldn't 
let me. However, I was allowed to use 3-pound weights when I went for my walk. 
</P>
<P>
"The change was gradual. My caddy has been with me 8 years and when I 
practiced, he would measure off the distance I hit with each club. But, I could 
tell by the way I felt that I was hitting the ball better." 
</P>
<P>
By late summer, Elder was playing regularly again and challenged in a couple of 
tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have felt good if I never shot better than 80," he said. "It was 
wonderful just competing again. It was a real bonus when I won the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
The victory put Elder in select company. He is one of nine pros to win $1 
million on the Regular PGA tour and also on the Senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
Elder was the first black golfer to play in the Masters. He was the first to 
make the Ryder Cup team, and the first to win a million on each tour. But he 
doesn't consider himself a pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, no," he said. "I had it easy. Charlie Sifford, Pete Brown and Rafe Botts. 
They took most of the knocks. They did the fighting. They were the ones not 
allowed to even dress in the clubhouse. I experienced some things, but it keeps 
getting better. I'm just trying to make it easier for those who will come along 
after me. 
</P>
<P>
"The worst experience was at the Masters in 1975. I was always on stage. 
Everybody wanted to know how it felt. And some wondered, 'Is he a gentleman?' I 
was a little bit better than the caddies. 
</P>
<P>
"In the week we (his wife Rose) were at the Masters, we had to change houses 
four times. The pressure was unfair. I couldn't think about golf. It was the 
first time I was ever happy to miss the cut. The next year Calvin Peete was 
there, too, so it was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
All the problems in a pro career that began 30 years ago don't seem too 
important since the heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
"The Lord gave me a second chance and I'm not going to get upset about 
anything," Elder said. "Maybe, I do have one little goal. I want to outdrive 
those guys again. Maybe this is the week I'll do it."

LAW OF ACADEMICS: 1ST-TERM TRUSTEE JIM ROACHE PROVES FULL OF SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SMOLLAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Thursday last month, Jim Roache popped in unannounced at Pershing Junior 
High in San Carlos for a tour, part of his periodic efforts as a San Diego city 
school board member to get an unvarnished, grass-roots feel for trends and 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
During the school lunch break, Principal Bill Hassett took Roache, who commands 
the county sheriff's substation in Lemon Grove, to chat with three math 
teachers eating in the no-smoking lounge. Roache immediately engaged the three 
in a lively discussion about the school district's new common core curriculum, 
an idea he co-sponsored last year. The core, now being phased in, will require 
all secondary school students to take college preparatory courses in basic 
subject areas, including algebra. 
</P>
<P>
The math teachers decried the plan, saying that some students simply cannot be 
taught algebra and that to require such classes will bring only further 
frustration to teacher and student, and could result in more dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
As Roache turned to leave after 20 minutes of animated questions and answers, 
one teacher asked him what he did for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in law enforcement," Roache replied, realizing the teacher had no idea he 
had been talking to a school board member. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, if ever you are with school administrators, you'll find they're the ones 
cramming this thing down our throats," the teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe I could plead guilty to being part of that," Roache laughed as 
he left. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact Outstrips Recognition 
</P>
<P>
The incident is illustrative of the fact that although many San Diegans -- even 
within the 11,000-employee school district -- may not recognize first-term 
board member Roache by face or name, they are keenly aware of his impact in 
changing the shape of local schools. 
</P>
<P>
Roache, finishing up only his second year as a school trustee, has surprised 
both administrators and fellow board members with his aggressive stance on 
reform issues. The many board initiatives under way have helped catapult San 
Diego into the forefront of districts nationwide that are experimenting -- at 
times with controversy -- with new ways of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Roache has belied the image he brought to the board: that of an 
inflexible right-wing ideologue. He is praised for his hard work, his 
willingness to listen and his enjoyment of debate without hidden agendas. 
Observers say he marks a substantial change in representation for his area in 
the the city's northeastern tier. Predecessor Larry Lester was an 
often-inflexible conservative member who delighted in staking out extreme 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Roache was elected the board's vice president as a prelude to 
becoming president next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Jim is doing a good job, although he comes from a conservative point 
of view," said colleague Kay Davis, the board's senior member, who has had her 
share of disagreements with Roache during the past two years, in particular 
over core curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
"He has very strong opinions, and sometimes he doesn't know everything about an 
issue before forming that strong opinion, and then you have to convince him to 
look at a different way or conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
"But what saves him is that he really is a pragmatist who realizes this is not 
a perfect world . . . " she said. 
</P>
<P>
District Supt. Tom Payzant said Roache has surprised many people, including 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Game Playing 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I thought he would be more ideological and have a stereotypical 
conservative agenda, however people wanted to define that, based on the 
consensus of what people were expecting," Payzant said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I have found him very open-minded, receptive to good data and 
well-reasoned argument, and his candor and ability to go to the heart of issues 
are very refreshing. Plus he has a good sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
"He has no hidden agendas and does no game playing, and that is commendable in 
public policy-making," Payzant said. "We do disagree at times, but he also has 
also taken risks and told his community things that they don't necessarily want 
to hear. That makes him very effective over the long haul in understanding the 
conflict at times between representing the people of his district and the best 
interests of students in all of San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Smith, who retired last month after eight years on the board 
representing heavily minority areas, said Roache has the potential to be the 
group's most influential member. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1987, Smith and Roache formed an alliance, considered unusual by some 
at the time, to push the core curriculum with colleagues and top administrators 
who were initially less than enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite my own misgivings at first -- I thought he was a little naive -- I 
soon found he really cared for kids," Smith said, citing a talk Roache gave at 
the dedication of DePortola Middle School in early 1987. "I didn't know what 
deep feelings he had for education until I heard him speak that day about 
patriotism, about high standards for all children (a longtime priority for 
Smith) and how education will affect America's future. 
</P>
<P>
"He opened his heart that day, and I was in tears at the end." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew He'd Be Stereotyped 
</P>
<P>
The lean, intense sheriff's captain said he knew he would be stereotyped when 
he joined the board. After all, his 1986 election opponent, Sue Braun, had 
labled Roache's background as simply "jails, jails, jails" in mocking his 
campaign for an education office. Roache won the final vote by a scant 903 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
"People said, 'He's a cop, he's a non-educator, he's a white male, and he comes 
from a predominantly Caucasian district.' And in their minds, that added up to 
a right-wing, red-necked, kick-ass, take-names conservative," Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, I am a conservative, but to me, that means a value system that at its 
base says that education is important to society, and that means my objective 
is to have all kids receive the best possible education no matter what color 
they are or where they come from." 
</P>
<P>
Both his own uneven educational background and his 18 years in law enforcement, 
often dealing with school-related problems, have helped bring forth not a 
cynical view of society, as many administrators assumed, but rather a sense 
that all things are possible. 
</P>
<P>
Roache acknowledges that he stayed in high school -- he graduated from 
Twentynine Palms High north of Palm Springs -- only because of athletics, and 
he dropped out of Grossmont College before joining the Air Force in the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Only after several years of supporting a wife and child on an enlisted man's 
sparse salary did Roache realize he needed further education to make more of 
his life. He returned to community college and eventually graduated from San 
Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Is Building Blocks 
</P>
<P>
"That is why the common core concept has been so important to me," Roache said. 
"A lot of kids are like I was, who don't know where they are going, who have no 
immediate goals. But at some point in the future, they will develop a plan, and 
the key is to give them the fundamental academic building blocks so that they 
won't be encumbered by poor basic educational preparation like I was when I 
matured. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll still have to work hard, but at least they will stand a chance of 
making it more quickly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Roache also links the core concept to his years in dealing with juveniles in 
trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, I'm a blue-collar type of guy, and I make no pretense to be an 
intellectual," Roache said. "But when I see a kid picked up for burglary or 
whatever, I sometimes talk with them and I see a chance is still there, that 
almost no one is beyond salvation and that there is always the chance that 
somebody will connect with them to turn them around." 
</P>
<P>
In his position as station commander, Roache oversees all contacts between his 
officers and public schools in the Grossmont and Lemon Grove school districts, 
giving him an additional perspective on school-related issues. Grossmont Union 
High School District Supt. Robert Pyle consults periodically with Roache on 
issues from violence to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Roache concedes that other San Diego board members, such as Kay Davis, have 
questioned his commitment to programs for children identified as gifted or for 
advanced placement testing for students ticketed for blue-chip universities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Them to Have the Option 
</P>
<P>
"I do care about those programs because those children are going to be our 
future doctors and physicists," Roache said. "But I am firmly convinced that 
the great portion of our future leaders, from clergy to politicians, are going 
to be from the vast, amorphous group of regular education kids, and they are 
going to end up driving our culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the common core so that more of these kids will have the options of 
being among our future leaders." 
</P>
<P>
The hard-charging style with which Roache has approached life admittedly has 
clashed with the nature of school board decision making. 
</P>
<P>
"I am impatient, I want to see quick results, but I know that on a lot of 
issues, the quick fix won't work and that it takes time on long-range, complex 
things such as the core," Roache said. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, I would have liked to have had the core curriculum implemented 
everywhere at once. But my philosophy is also to be pragmatic, to take a little 
at a time if you can't persuade everyone of the validity of the entire program. 
The reality of implementation involves budgets and teachers and administrators, 
and I know from my own experience (he oversees 40 people with an annual budget 
of $1.5 million) that it must be a group effort. . . . I need to give others 
more time to work through things." 
</P>
<P>
Roache has staked out clear positions on two major issues expected to come 
before the board in 1989: a possible change to district-only elections and the 
idea of health clinics at schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relishes the Debate 
</P>
<P>
On both, he appears opposed to positions of the two new board members, Ann 
Armstrong and Shirley Weber, but Roache said he looks forward to honest debate 
and, where possible, compromise. 
</P>
<P>
Already, Roache arranged for the board to meet in an informal workshop last 
month where members could learn about their colleagues' philosophies candidly 
and firsthand, rather than relying on media reports as the previous board did 
in forming its first impressions of Roache. 
</P>
<P>
He cites his own votes on year-round schools as a reason for keeping the 
present system of electing school board members, rather than opting for 
elections by geographic district only. (Currently, two finalists are nominated 
in a primary by voters in their geographic district, but compete in the entire 
school district in the final election.) Roache went against the wishes of many 
in the upscale, influential Scripps Ranch area in 1987 by supporting Payzant's 
recommendation to have the area's elementary school, Jerabek, go year-round on 
a four-track schedule to relieve overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that some constituents still feel I sold them down the river," 
Roache said. After more than a year of implementation, the year-round schedule 
is said to be going smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"But if I voted in opposition, how in good conscience could I tell some other 
school or some other community in San Diego to go multi-track year-round? Yet 
if we had district-only elections, I don't know how I could risk making such a 
vote and not become the target of organized special interests and community 
activists, who have great power within districts, at the next election." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversy Could Erupt 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of health clinics, Roache was told last month by Hassett, the 
principal at Pershing, that clinics are needed because too many children do not 
have regular medical care until their illnesses become crises. 
</P>
<P>
"How you do it given the controversy that could erupt, I don't know," Hassett 
said, referring to a wrenching board debate that occurred three years ago over 
the issue of providing birth control and abortion information. The board voted 
3 to 2 against a Payzant plan for the clinics. Roache's predecessor, Lester, 
led the battle against them. 
</P>
<P>
However, both new members, Weber and Armstrong, favor clinics and, together 
with board President Susan Davis, could provide the majority needed to 
establish them. 
</P>
<P>
"I agree that there is a legitimate need for health care services for 
adolescents and youth and it is not being met now," Roache said. "I have 
political reservations about whether that is proper for schools, but the 
practical side of me says that society is paying a tremendous cost because it 
isn't being done elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"If some program can be designed for those services, I would favor it. But if 
you add birth control and abortion aspects, that offends me. I want some 
parental contact included when you do that, even though I know a lot of parents 
don't talk to their children about (sex-related) matters and that some kids 
don't have parents to talk to. 
</P>
<P>
"But it just offends me if we don't bring the parent or guardian into the 
process on the campus. . . . By not doing so, we are saying we know what is 
best for their kid despite any moral or religious values of the family, or that 
parents aren't thinking right on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand, we are arguing in all our reform efforts that parent support 
is vital for the success of school, but we don't want them there when it comes 
to pregnancy or sex." 
</P>
<P>
Roache said he will work for compromise if both sides are amenable. Despite his 
feelings on family planning, he supports programs at several high schools that 
allow teen-age mothers to continue their schooling while receiving child care 
and birth control information. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just throw the kids out of school," Roache said. "This is a real, 
real difficult issue, and we have to avoid the extremism of both sides."

MOTORCYCLE THEFT SUSPECT WOUNDED BY LA MESA POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A La Mesa police officer shot a man in the chest Friday night while police were 
attempting to arrest him in Lemon Grove. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as James L. Warnicke, 22, of Lemon Grove was listed in 
serious condition Sunday at UC San Diego Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
La Mesa police spokeswoman Allison Moore said Officer Jeff Allen followed two 
motorcyclists to a Lemon Grove liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting outside, Allen was advised by his radio dispatcher that one of the 
motorcycles had been reported stolen. The officer asked for backup assistance 
and when other officers arrived, they confronted the two men. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the officers asked both men to raise their hands, but that 
Warnicke "suddenly moved his hands to an object in his waistband." She said the 
officers again ordered him to stop, but that Warnicke repeated the movement and 
that Allen then fired one shot, hitting Warnicke in the right side of the 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
Warnicke was taken by Life-flight to the medical center, where he was held on 
suspicion of motorcycle theft. 
</P>
<P>
His companion, Andre Perez, 26, of La Mesa, was held in the downtown county 
jail on suspicion of possessing a dangerous weapon and on several outstanding 
warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said detectives found a knife at the scene, but she said it was unclear 
what, if anything, Warnicke may have had inside his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a 3-year police veteran, was placed on administrative leave while the 
investigation is continuing.

SMOKE FROM RUBBISH FIRE FILLS JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burning rubbish and debris was placed inside a ventilation system duct at the 
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center Sunday afternoon, sending a large 
amount of smoke wafting through several levels of the high-rise jail building 
downtown, San Diego fire officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
Fire Capt. William Middleton said there were no injuries to inmates but the 
incident presented some problems for jail officials because smoke was blown 
through several stories of the complex. He said the burning material had been 
placed inside a duct on the 8th floor. 
</P>
<P>
"Other than that, it was a relatively small fire and easy to contain," 
Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 2:30 p.m., he said. Because the location was a 
high-rise, 24-story structure, the Fire Department sent a large number of units 
to the scene, including eight engine companies, four truck companies, a rescue 
rig, three battalion chiefs and one division chief. 
</P>
<P>
Jail officials declined to comment on the incident.

CONSTRUCTIVE DISSENT; 
</P>
<P>
A TOPANGA-BASED GROUP IS OPPOSING U.S. POLICY BY HELPING NICARAGUANS WITH 
BUILDING PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ted Heselton is, in effect, a contra Contra. The 40-year-old West 
Kennebunkport, Me., carpenter and Vietnam veteran spent 6 weeks in war-torn 
Nicaragua in 1987 helping build houses, a school and a water system in a poor 
rural cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frustrated with demonstrations and wanted to do something more personal 
and practical," said Heselton, a staunch opponent of U.S. support for the 
anti-Sandinista rebels. "The point is to somehow help the situation rather than 
having those policies done in my name as a U.S. taxpayer." 
</P>
<P>
Heselton is one of 350 volunteers from across the nation who have been 
recruited and dispatched to Nicaragua's battle-scarred highlands since 1984 by 
a Topanga-based organization, Architects and Planners in Support of Nicaragua. 
These short-term brigadistas have built 85 homes, four schools and four water 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Providing Equipment 
</P>
<P>
APSNICA, as it is known, has also shipped $170,000 in trucks, generators, 
chain-saw mills and other equipment to Nicaragua and taught campesinos to use 
them. It has sent teachers, biochemists and transportation planners to the 
Central American country for several months each to assist the government. It 
has arranged trips for Americans to see the revolution firsthand. And, most 
recently, it is helping rebuild a hurricane-ravaged village. 
</P>
<P>
Its slogan defines its mission: "Help Build Not Destroy in Nicaragua." 
</P>
<P>
The grass-roots, nonprofit project is run out of an architectural firm, set 
deep within wooded Topanga Canyon, that specializes in helping the poor and 
handicapped. APSNICA is one of a handful of groups nationwide -- and the 
largest in Southern California -- that recruits Americans to support a 
Sandinista revolution that the Reagan Administration has actively opposed for 
the past 8 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenging Policy 
</P>
<P>
"Our idea always was that we should bring people down in different capacities 
so that they can see what was happening there, work with the Nicaraguans, help 
them, but also come back here and tell others what they've seen so we can 
change the policy of the Administration," said Stephen Kerpen, 52, the Topanga 
architect who founded and directs APSNICA. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a policy, sad to say, that doesn't respect the sovereignty of Nicaragua, 
that's contemptuous of Third World people. And it's a policy that kills men, 
women and children." 
</P>
<P>
APSNICA's educational program -- which includes individual slide shows, house 
parties and a quarterly newsletter -- has reached more than 15,000 individuals 
in the United States, Kerpen said. Volunteers have also made presentations to 
civic groups, including several local Rotary clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, groups such as the Quixote Center in Mount Rainier, Md.; Witness 
for Peace in Washington, and TecNica in Berkeley have raised $202 million in 
labor and supplies for Nicaragua since June, 1985, according to Sister Maureen 
Fiedler, co-director of the Quixote Center. In addition, she said 1,500 
Americans are working in Nicaragua at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
These efforts seek to counteract U.S. military and humanitarian support for the 
Contras. In fact, Fiedler said, annual fund-raising goals have been based on 
the amount of U.S. Contra aid. 
</P>
<P>
APSNICA's recruits represent a cross-section of men and women from 15 states. 
Their ranks have included a cabinetmaker, computer programmer, factory worker, 
lawyer, park ranger, electrician, waitress, mechanical engineer, university 
lecturer and music teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Some enlist because they want to see firsthand what's happening in Nicaragua, 
Kerpen said. Others are drawn to a revolution that they say epitomizes a sense 
of community and idealism that is missing in the United States. Many are driven 
by opposition to the Administration's Central American policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selective Service Age 
</P>
<P>
Heselton, who lives 12 miles from President-elect George Bush's family estate, 
has another, more personal, incentive to see the Central American hostilities 
end: His 19-year-old son recently registered with the Selective Service. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see him killing Nicaraguans, and I don't want to see him in a 
war down there," he said. "I don't see anything going on in Central America 
that's worth Americans dying for." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone pays his or her way down, room and board, a $300 administrative fee 
and insurance costs as well as foregoing potential earnings at home. APSNICA 
bluntly advises prospective recruits that they are putting themselves "in an 
inherently risky situation." 
</P>
<P>
Participants find various ways to take the time off. Some are self-employed. 
Those who work in construction may go during the winter lull. Some teachers use 
their summer vacations. Others take a leave of absence or go between jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department does not have an official policy opposing such groups 
as APSNICA as long as they comply with U.S. law, said press officer Anita 
Stockman. Kerpen, however, maintains that APSNICA has been harassed by the 
government while shipping supplies. And some U.S. elected officials are 
critical of those who seek to bolster the Managua government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sandinistas Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to object to people building shelter for the citizens of Nicaragua, 
who are certainly among the oppressed of the earth," said Rep. Henry Hyde 
(R-Ill.), a high-profile Contra supporter. "I do object to strengthening the 
Sandinista government because I think it's a tyranny." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sandinistas -- who work closely with APSNICA -- welcome the 
volunteers with open arms. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been doing a wonderful job there," said Rita Clark, who is assistant 
to Nicaragua's charge d'affaires in Washington and has visited APSNICA 
projects. "These are people who saw a need and they started helping. The more 
they do, the more they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Weiss, 41, a Minneapolis carpenter and self-described anti-imperialist, 
first went to Nicaragua with APSNICA in early 1987. He returned for almost 8 
months later in the year as a project coordinator with his wife and two 
daughters. He's going back for 6 weeks in March. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Won't Give Up' 
</P>
<P>
Weiss said he was most impressed by the pride and determination of the 
Nicaraguan peasants. For example, he recalled sitting around a campfire one 
evening when two older couples discussed the hardships they endured under Gen. 
Anastasio Somoza, the former U.S.-backed Nicaraguan president who was ousted by 
the revolution in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy said, 'We'll die before we'll go back to that. We're campesinos. We 
know hunger. We can do that again. But we won't give up what we have for 
anything.' " 
</P>
<P>
Two events in the past 2 years have spurred APSNICA to expand its activities. 
The most recent was Hurricane Joan, which killed more than 116 Nicaraguans in 
October and further wracked an economy already crippled by war. 
</P>
<P>
In response, APSNICA established a wood-milling operation in Pearl Lagoon on 
the Caribbean coast 25 miles north of Bluefields, a town of 42,000 that was 
largely destroyed. Volunteers are harvesting hurricane-felled trees on the 
river bank and floating them downriver to the mill, where they will be used to 
rebuild homes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activist's Death 
</P>
<P>
The other occurrence was the death of Benjamin E. Linder, 27, a mechanical 
engineer from Portland, Ore., who suffered a fatal head wound in 1987 when his 
armed work crew was ambushed by rebels in the northern Nicaragua war zone. 
Linder was working on a hydroelectric project under the auspices of the 
Nicaragua Appropriate Technology Project, which he had helped found. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt strongly that he was targeted because he was a real figure down 
there," Kerpen said as he sat at his desk beneath a poster of Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega. "And we felt it was a means for this Administration to 
stop other Americans from building in Nicaragua. So instead of stopping us, we 
made plans to build twice as much." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Linder, who was reportedly carrying a Kalashnikov assault rifle for 
protection, APSNICA volunteers do not bear arms. Instead, they put themselves 
in the hands of the cooperative defense committees. There have been no APSNICA 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The construction efforts are around the town of Mantiguas in the Matagalpa 
region of north-central Nicaragua, which Kerpen describes as "a war zone but 
not what you might call a combat zone." Volunteers have heard mortar fire but 
never been in imminent danger, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grieving Mother 
</P>
<P>
They have encountered grieving Nicaraguans, however. When an APSNICA-sponsored 
delegation visited a cooperative that had been attacked by Contras, a woman 
took the group to the grave site of her 16-year-old son who had been killed 5 
days earlier, Kerpen recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"She said, 'If any of you have cameras, take pictures of all the kids because I 
don't even have a photograph of my son.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, the volunteers face many hardships. Health problems are endemic. APSNICA 
warns participants prior to departure that typhoid fever is "not uncommon"; 
hepatitis is "very common"; malaria is "quite common"; worms, amoebas and other 
diarrhea-causing parasites are "almost inevitable," and "many Nicaraguan dogs 
have rabies." 
</P>
<P>
Living conditions are primitive. The weather is hot and humid. Food is simple. 
The workweek entails 45 hours of hard physical labor. Volunteers wash their 
clothes by hand in the river. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Self-Sufficient 
</P>
<P>
"I realized how simple the life is there, how people have learned to live on 
the basis of their ability to devise tools and hard work," said Lisa Aarli, 29, 
a Chicago tenant organizer who spent 2 months in Nicaragua in early 1988. "It 
was one of the most intensive experiences of my life." 
</P>
<P>
The experience of working in Nicaragua generally reinforces pre-existing 
support for the revolution or creates new-found sympathy, Kerpen said. 
Volunteers Heselton, Weiss and Aarli said this was the case for them. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Aarli said: "We were very isolated. We were staying on this cooperative. 
We didn't get out to see other things. In some ways, I didn't see much in a 
bigger, broader sense." 
</P>
<P>
It was the bigger geopolitical picture that Kerpen says drew him to Nicaragua 
as a cause. A native New Yorker, he began his architectural activism nearly 25 
years ago with urban renewal efforts in Harlem and continued them when he moved 
to California in the late '60s and directed the Rural Development Corp., which 
built federally subsidized housing in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unpaid Post 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, he established a private architectural firm specializing in low-income 
housing and barrier-free designs for the disabled with his partner, David 
Marshall. Peoples Center for Housing Change now provides the headquarters and 
corporate umbrella for APSNICA; Kerpen is the unsalaried, full-time director, 
while Marshall handles Peoples Center's paying clients. 
</P>
<P>
Kerpen and two others founded APSNICA after a trip to Nicaragua in 1984. The 
idea arose when a Sandinista official asked them to raise money in the United 
States for housing in Nicaragua. The first brigade was dispatched in December, 
1985, to build 25 simple 3-room, brick-and-stone houses, a 1,200-square-foot 
school and a water system. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people will ask us, 'Well, aren't there communists down there?' " Kerpen 
said. "The fact is that every country has a right to decide what kind of a 
government they have. . . . Of course, if anything, it's a nationalist 
government down there and nothing else. But the question itself is 
impertinent."

ECONOMISTS SPLIT ON WHERE U.S. IS HEADED; 
</P>
<P>
PANEL AGREES DEFICIT IS KEY ISSUE BUT DIVIDES ON CHANCE OF RECESSION

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times' panel of distinguished economists reached a standoff 
this year, equally divided over whether 1989 will be the year that a recession 
finally halts America's longest postwar boom. 
</P>
<P>
But the six members of The Times' Board of Economists who participated in the 
year-end survey more or less agreed that three key issues will determine 1989's 
economic fate. These are whether the Bush Administration and Congress will 
agree on meaningful steps to lower the budget deficit; the reactions of foreign 
investors, especially the Japanese, to economic developments here, and whether 
American consumers, loaded down with record levels of debt, will nevertheless 
continue to spend beyond their means. 
</P>
<P>
As always, the Federal Reserve Board's role in setting interest rates, largely 
in response to these issues, also is considered crucial. 
</P>
<P>
The economists' forecasts differ so widely mainly because they hinge on 
predictions of human behavior and the outcome of political maneuvering in 
Washington, rather than simple number-crunching. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Participants 
</P>
<P>
The bright note this year is that the board of economists as a group is 
somewhat less pessimistic now than a year ago. Jarred by the October, 1987, 
stock market crash, five out of eight board members last year predicted 
recession in 1988. But the American economy romped right past the crash, 
growing by at least 2.6% last year. 
</P>
<P>
Only six economists participated this year because two have been enlisted in 
the service of the Bush Administration. Michael A. Boskin resigned from the 
board because he was named chairman of the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers. Board member Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of political economy and 
public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, declined to participate because he 
is now serving as an adviser to the President's council. 
</P>
<P>
The three who predict no recession in 1989 are George L. Perry, a senior fellow 
at the Brookings Institution in Washington; Paul R. Krugman, a professor of 
economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Irwin L. Kellner, 
chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But those who predict that the expansion will come to an end in what is now its 
seventh year are Robert Lekachman, professor of economics at Lehman College of 
the City University of New York and author of "Visions and Nightmares: America 
After Reagan"; David M. Gordon, economics professor at the New School for 
Social Research in New York, and A. Gary Shilling, a New York-based economic 
consultant and author of "The World Has Definitely Changed." 
</P>
<P>
While the budget deficit has been a big concern in past years, this year the 
economists agree that it is a pivotal question for the U.S. economy in 1989. 
One reason is that the budget deficit, and the related U.S. trade deficit, have 
become key determinants for how foreign investors and foreign central bankers 
react, driving the dollar down or up, and making foreign capital for investment 
here plentiful or scarce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Recession Scenario 
</P>
<P>
The two economists who believe that Congress and the new President will be able 
to agree promptly on budgetary steps serious enough to impress the jittery 
world markets predicted that the economic expansion will continue at least one 
more year, although the economy will probably grow at a slower rate. One, 
Krugman, predicted no recession even though he doubts that there will be much 
progress on the deficit this year. 
</P>
<P>
But the rest, who don't expect agreement this year on spending cuts or a 
combination of spending cuts and tax increases predicted a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The recession scenario generally goes like this: A marked failure to do 
something about the deficit could cause the dollar to drop dramatically against 
major foreign currencies such as the yen and the West German mark as foreign 
investors conclude that the U.S. economy isn't such a good investment and 
foreign central bankers decide that there is no longer any point to propping up 
the dollar. The Fed responds by sharply raising interest rates to attract back 
foreign investors (higher interest rates on investments help compensate 
investors for a depreciating dollar) and to choke off inflation that may be 
caused by more expensive imports. 
</P>
<P>
But a big hike in interest rates could easily end the expansion and would be 
particularly dangerous at a time when both individuals and companies are loaded 
up with record levels of debt. 
</P>
<P>
Making the situation even more fragile, says Shilling, is that record amounts 
of both personal and company debt are now subject to fluctuating, variable-rate 
interest payments. This includes variable-rate mortgages, home equity loans and 
credit card accounts for individuals, as well as variable-rate borrowing by 
companies. As a result, Shilling says, any big hike in interest rates would be 
felt almost immediately throughout the economy, triggering bankruptcies and an 
abrupt drop-off of consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
Shilling foresees a recession starting in the first half of 1989, setoff in 
part by the Fed raising interest rates to choke off a perceived threat of 
renewed inflation and to make up for an expected loss of confidence in the 
American economy by foreign investors. "It will be a classic case of the Fed 
being forced to raise short-term interest rates to recession-precipitating 
levels," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Shilling also sees the first strong signs in some time of fear by industry that 
inflation, currently at a relatively low rate of 4.5% annually as measured by 
the consumer price index, is about to take off. Companies, he says, are doing 
the first hedge-buying of inventory -- stocking up on supplies in expectation 
that prices are about to go up -- since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Lekachman, another predictor of recession, owns up to having forecast a 
downturn every year for the past four years. But he maintains that "the chances 
are about 2 to 1 that by the fourth quarter of 1989, we'll see the recession." 
He predicts that the main cause will be Japanese investors and Japan's central 
bank, responding to what they view as a weak U.S. President and a political 
"mess" in Washington's approach to the deficit. Lekachman notes that the United 
States depends on a massive influx of foreign capital and says he detects signs 
that the Japanese are increasingly willing to throw their weight around on the 
global economic scene. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reprieve Predicted 
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese lose confidence in Bush's ability to reduce the deficit, they 
may well reduce their buying at U.S. Treasury auctions, which in turn could 
sharply push up U.S. interest rates. "This will be the classic trigger for a 
recession," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon foresees a particularly deep recession. "It's going to be pretty nasty 
because of the mountainous levels of personal and corporate debt," he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Kellner, a member of The Times' board who last year predicted a recession, 
this year thinks the economy will squeak by with another reprieve. Kellner 
thinks that despite the political problems, the Bush Administration will win an 
agreement this year with legislators on a plan to eliminate the deficit over 
four years. This, he maintains, would be enough to satisfy foreign investors 
and Japanese and European governments and allow the Fed to ease up on its 
current tight-money policy. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Kellner predicts a slackening of consumer spending sufficient to 
keep inflation in check but not severe enough to induce a recession. Of the six 
economists, Kellner alone expects consumer spending to slow significantly 
without a sharp jolt of higher interest rates first. 
</P>
<P>
Economic forecasters consider consumer spending extremely important to their 
calculations since it makes up about two-thirds of the nation's economic 
activity. (Slightly under half of this goes for items bought in stores, the 
rest goes for rent, health care, transportation and other services.) 
</P>
<P>
Kellner believes that consumers are getting exhausted from years of increased 
spending and are about to cut back. With employment high, he says, "There is no 
pent-up demand for big ticket items people delayed buying because they were out 
of work." 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that prices of expensive consumer items have risen faster than 
most peoples' incomes. "Given that the cost of big-ticket items has gone up 
faster than incomes, people have bought about all they're going to buy," he 
asserts. As evidence, he cites the fact that consumer spending, adjusted for 
inflation, was lower this fall than it was two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of The Times panel, however, doubts that consumers are likely to begin 
acting so rationally. Some say that during the past eight years, encouraged by 
the economic boom and the Republican Administration's supply side economics, 
the habit of spending much and saving little has become ingrained. "Ronald 
Reagan . . . really has gone a long distance to reinforce the American attitude 
of spend today, pay tomorrow," says Lekachman. 
</P>
<P>
Shilling, too, sees no signs of consumer spending slowing down. He notes that 
the stock market crash didn't shock consumers into spending less. "The consumer 
just isn't giving up," he said. "People are way overextended. They're borrowing 
to pay their bills. People don't want to give up on the American dream of 
ever-increasing purchasing power." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Economy Pretty Healthy' 
</P>
<P>
Early indications that 1988 Christmas buying was relatively strong seem to give 
credit to those who see no falloff of consumer spending. One fear is that 
continued strong consumer demand will add to inflationary pressures, forcing 
the Fed to continue raising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But Perry, although he foresees little change in consumer spending levels this 
year, says he isn't particularly worried. "I think the economy is pretty 
healthy," he states, adding that he thinks a recession in 1989 is unlikely. 
"People have predicted it every year, and every year they've been wrong," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that the economy is slowing a bit and that the gross national 
product -- a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy -- will 
continue to grow at an acceptably low rate of about 3% in 1989. Perry doubts 
that foreigners will become so concerned about the U.S. economic situation that 
they will begin dumping dollars. And he said that any substantial improvement 
in the budget deficit would be met by a decline in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
He gives the Fed credit for keeping growth rates and inflation in check. "The 
Fed is doing what it traditionally has done, to lean against the wind," Perry 
says. "It sees an expansion that is still pretty vigorous, and it's letting 
interest rates rise to take a little steam out." 
</P>
<P>
Krugman, while not completely ruling out the possibility of recession in 1989, 
sees a greater risk of an overheating economy. "The fundamentals are that we 
still have very strong domestic demand and a weak dollar," he says. He believes 
that the Fed will continue to nudge up interest rates, even enough to send some 
highly leveraged companies into bankruptcy. But because demand is so strong, he 
doesn't predict a full-fledged recession. Because with the wave of corporate 
takeovers and leveraged buyouts companies are heavily indebted, "what we have 
is a strange economy -- you could have a lot of bankrupt companies working at 
(full) capacity."

BUSINESS GROUPS CALL DEFICIT REDUCTION MOST CRITICAL TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, Times Staff Writer

<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For organizations representing business in Washington, the transition from 
President Reagan to President Bush is a change from very good to even better. 
</P>
<P>
Business almost always found itself on Reagan's side. His campaigns to cut tax 
rates and reduce burdensome federal regulations could have been written in 
corporate board rooms. 
</P>
<P>
But Reagan's Administration was a tumultuous one. He vetoed 78 pieces of 
legislation in his eight years, and Congress managed to override him nine 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Now representatives of business organizations are looking forward with pleasure 
to a kinder, gentler era. George Bush, while no less business oriented than 
Reagan, is a two-term veteran of the House of Representatives; of the 13 
Cabinet members he has selected so far, two are former senators and three are 
former House members. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders predict that Bush will try to establish a more cooperative 
relationship with the Democratic-controlled House and Senate. And that, they 
hope, will prove more productive -- especially on the all-important issue of 
reducing the federal deficit -- than Reagan's more confrontational style. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a consummate Washington insider," said Joseph P. O'Neil, president of 
the American Retail Federation. "He's more inclined to seek accommodations than 
President Reagan was. On that score, a lot of issues left on the table are 
likely to get settled." 
</P>
<P>
For example, several business lobbyists suggested, Bush might propose a 
compromise minimum wage increase, lower than the $4.55 an hour unsuccessfully 
sought by the Democrats. That way, Bush could get credit for helping the 
working poor without offending business groups. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Bush proposals on parental leave and child care would force Congress 
to address those issues on his terms and impose less of a burden on business 
than Democratic alternatives that were talked to death in the Senate last fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prefer Spending Cuts 
</P>
<P>
Business has no particular legislative wish list of its own. At one time it 
might have hoped that Bush would follow through on a campaign promise and 
propose a tax break for capital gains. But now it understands that Bush does 
not dare propose tinkering with the tax code for fear that Congress would take 
the opportunity to legislate tax increases as well as reductions. 
</P>
<P>
"Business agenda?" asked Stacy Mobley, vice president for federal relations of 
Du Pont Co. "We're always reacting. This coming year, like all other years, 
we're going to be reacting." Business' fondest hope is that Bush and Congress 
will join forces to reduce the federal deficit. Business organizations regard 
spending cuts as the best approach, although some of them would even tolerate a 
tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Ross, assistant vice president for communications of the National Assn. of 
Manufacturers, said NAM hoped that Bush would follow the lead of the National 
Economic Commission, a congressionally mandated blue-ribbon panel that is to 
recommend budget-cutting measures next year. 
</P>
<P>
"We favor spending cuts," Ross said, "and then a consumption tax increase as a 
last resort." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil, of the American Retail Federation, agreed that the budget was the most 
critical issue facing the nation and said a lot of Washington insiders expected 
a tax increase next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Retailers are against consumption taxes," he said, "but a lot of business 
firms would support a gasoline tax increase as a way to cut the deficit if the 
money is earmarked for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Mobley also rated deficit reduction as Bush's leading problem. "Everything 
hinges on that," Mobley said. "At least a combination of spending cuts and new 
revenues are needed. Bush is going to have to play an active role. I don't 
foresee any stalemate or legislative gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Veto Less Likely 
</P>
<P>
As for a gasoline tax increase, he added: "We're not pushing it, but if you had 
to look at additional revenues, it's broad-based, doesn't adversely affect 
energy-intensive industries and is probably the lesser of all the evils." 
</P>
<P>
But most business representatives take a hard line against any kind of tax 
increase. "If Bush agrees to a tax increase as the Democrats want him to do, 
he's a one-term President," said John J. Motley, legislative director for the 
National Federation of Independent Business, which represents small retail and 
service firms with an average of eight employees and $500,000 in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
And Stephen Moore, a budget analyst for the business-backed Heritage 
Foundation, said Bush should be willing to accept the automatic, indiscriminate 
spending cuts of the Gramm-Rudman law rather than raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
On overall relations with Congress, there was a consensus that Bush would be 
far less likely to resort to the veto and more likely to make deals with the 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a product of Washington," Du Pont's Mobley said. "He didn't run 
against Washington. My feeling is that he will be able to work with Congress 
better than Reagan or Jimmy Carter. I think he will seek accommodation." 
</P>
<P>
Al Bourland, a veteran of 20 years of lobbying for the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Bush) is going to put out the olive branch more than Reagan did," Bourland 
said. "I think you'll have less of a philosophical approach -- he's more 
inclined to a political, pragmatic solution." 
</P>
<P>
But Bourland added that the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate could 
challenge Bush on the theory that he is less popular than Reagan and thus less 
likely to be able to appeal to the public over the heads of the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he said, business groups could rely on a Reagan veto or the threat 
of a Reagan veto to influence major legislation as it went through the House 
and Senate. "It was one of the biggest arrows in our quiver," Bourland 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, think that Bush could undercut his -- and business's -- 
political opponents by going on the offensive on such controversial issues as 
raising the federal minimum wage, unchanged since 1981 at $3.35 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats brought up a bill this year to raise that figure to $4.55 an 
hour, but Republicans filibustered it to death -- even though Bush said in a 
campaign statement that he favored some unspecified increase. 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyist Motley said Bush could propose a $4.25 hourly rate, together with a 
lower figure for young people, and probably get near-unanimous Republican 
support and enough Democrats to assure the bill's enactment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you may see this Administration go on the offensive with initiatives 
of their own in two or three areas," Motley said. 
</P>
<P>
The same technique, business lobbyists agreed, could be employed on other 
social legislation to get bipartisan backing for Bush initiatives on child 
care, unpaid leave for new parents and health insurance for workers not covered 
by company plans. 
</P>
<P>
And on environmental issues, business expects renewed action now that Senate 
Democrats have selected George J. Mitchell of Maine as their new leader and 
Bush has named William K. Reilly, president of the World Wildlife Fund, as head 
of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Congress is likely to try to amend the Clean Air Act, a pet 
issue of Mitchell's. But business groups are confident that Mitchell will have 
to make concessions to their concerns over additional costs if he wants to get 
the legislation through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On their major stand against new federal benefits, the business groups expect 
Bush to be on their side, with his veto pen ready if necessary. But there is a 
yearning for a more ecumenical style. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush is a very pro-business President, and we're grateful for that," said the 
NAM's Ross. "But problems are coming to a head, with a lot of unfinished 
business. We need a consensus approach."

INVESTING IN 1989; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYING IT SAFE COULD BE WRONG STRATEGY; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE, SHORT-TERM BONDS LOOK GOOD BUT ART MARKET MAY COOL 
</P>

<P>
Investors played it safe in 1988. But they would have been better off had they 
not. And being overly cautious this year also could be a mistake, many 
investment advisers say. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by takeovers, strong corporate earnings and other factors, stocks defied 
a mass exodus by individual investors to post double-digit gains last year. As 
the table accompanying this story shows, equities and equity mutual funds 
easily beat bonds, savings and most other conservative investments that small 
investors generally preferred amid lingering memories of the October, 1987, 
stock crash. 
</P>
<P>
But bonds -- led by the high-yield "junk" sector -- did well during the year, 
despite rising interest rates toward year-end that pushed prices down and 
partially offset gains in yields. 
</P>
<P>
Collectibles posted a mixed year, with art topping all major investments in 
1988 with a whopping 41.99% gain through November, and rare investment-grade 
coins finishing second. But stamp prices took a licking, rising just barely. 
The biggest losers: gold and silver, hit by abundant supplies and subdued fears 
of higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Will these trends continue in 1989? Not surprisingly, experts can't agree on 
the overall direction for stocks and bonds. But on some things there is general 
agreement: 
</P>
<P>
* Buyers of short-term bonds and money market funds will continue to enjoy 
among the best yields in years, at least into the early part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
* Although the Dow Jones industrial index closed 1988 near a post-crash high, 
plenty of individual stocks are depressed and have room to go much higher. 
</P>
<P>
* Some housing markets, such as those in California, will continue to be hot, 
while others, such as in oil-depressed areas and the Northeast, will remain in 
slumps. 
</P>
<P>
* Gold and silver are likely to remain dull, but platinum has a brighter 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
* Blistering prices in the art market are due for a correction. 
</P>
<P>
Whether these predictions come true, of course, depends a lot on what happens 
to interest rates and the economy. Economists generally predict that interest 
rates will continue rising into the first part of the year, declining in the 
second half as economic growth slows. A recession may be a threat in late 1989 
and early 1990, economists say, but they have been crying wolf about a downturn 
for months now -- and the economy fortunately has not obliged. 
</P>
<P>
A recession "will happen eventually, but when is still too early too tell," 
says David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources, reflecting the 
gun-shy attitude of many forecasters who have made it a habit of prematurely 
predicting recessions. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a review of opinions on some key segments for small investors: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bonds and savings 
</P>
<P>
Bonds had a good year generally, as "junk bonds," municipals and long-term 
investment-grade corporates posted double-digit total returns (including price 
appreciation and yield). 
</P>
<P>
Savers are enjoying among the highest yields in short-term investments in 
years, thanks to the Fed's tight-money policies. Yields on three-month Treasury 
bills, for example, recently hit 8.22%, the highest in 3 1/2 years. Recent 
9%-plus yields on two-year Treasuries have topped those on 30-year issues. 
</P>
<P>
Money market funds also look great, yielding an average of 8.52%, more than two 
percentage points better than the 6.20% average yields for bank money market 
deposit accounts. The spread normally is less than 1 point, but now is higher 
because money market funds generally move up faster in a rising interest rate 
environment, says Susan M. Cook, editor of Donoghue's Money Fund Report. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts generally expect short-term rates to continue rising well into the 
first half of this year. But toward mid-year, they say, interest rates should 
begin to decline, making money market funds and short-term Treasuries somewhat 
less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, some advisers say, investors should consider buying long-term 
Treasury issues. Even though they yield less than short-term issues now, they 
are a good way to lock in high yields, and they will gain in value once 
interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
For conservative investors who stick only to safe, federally insured bank 
certificates of deposit, the outlook is both good and bad. Banks will continue 
to be slow in boosting CD rates to keep up with rises in the prime rate and 
other market interest rates, says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate 
Monitor.

"There is no reason to believe that banks in '89 will suddenly get religion to 
help the consumer," Heady says. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, those who shop for the highest-yielding CDs nationwide are 
finding that troubled institutions no longer dominate the list of firms with 
highest savings rates. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the percentage of troubled Texas thrifts on the lists of 
institutions with top-yielding CDs has plummeted from 75% to 13%, Heady says. 
They have been replaced by much-stronger Northeastern institutions, who are 
boosting rates to attract deposit money that can then be loaned out to fuel 
that region's bustling economy. That trend should continue this year, Heady 
says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stocks 
</P>
<P>
Surprising many experts, stocks had a good year last year, with Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index gaining 16.61% with dividends reinvested. The Dow Jones 
industrial index closed at 2,168.57, close to its post-crash high of 2183.50. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no consensus that the good times will continue rolling. 
</P>
<P>
Even normally bullish brokerage houses disagree. Dean Witter, for example, 
leads the bulls in suggesting that investors put 71% of their assets into 
stocks, versus 25% in bonds and only 4% in cash equivalents. But over at Paine 
Webber, bearish analysts advise only 14% in equities, versus 35% in bonds and a 
whopping 51% in cash equivalents. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, experts are looking at much of the same data but are coming to 
different conclusions. The bulls see low price-earnings ratios (stock prices 
divided by earnings per share) on the S&amp;P 500 of about 12, down from above 
20 before the crash and more than 15 after the crash. They also cite strong 
gains in corporate profits and cash flow, and predictions that takeovers will 
continue at 1988's hot pace. 
</P>
<P>
The bulls also point to the high degree of pessimism among investment advisers. 
Such bearishness is actually bullish, they say, because it means that a lot of 
selling has already occurred. "A lot of people have a lot of cash, and that's a 
mistake," says John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment policy committee at 
Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
But the bears counter that there is still a lot more cash that could hit the 
sidelines before stocks are ready to take off again. High yields on Treasury 
securities and other fixed-income investments are siphoning off money that 
otherwise would go to stocks. Recent rallies have occured with low trading 
volume and relatively few stocks setting new 52-week highs, they say. And the 
threat of recession and slower economic growth bodes poorly for equities. 
</P>
<P>
Weighing all arguments, some experts are straddling the fence. The Dow, they 
say, will continue to trade in a narrow range between 1,900 and 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
"Until there is some direction from the new Bush Administration on fundamental 
economic issues, such as the budget deficit . . . the market is going to 
continue to trade in a narrow range," says Joseph Hardiman, president of the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers. "Once we see how these issues are 
resolved, you'll see a (clearer) direction for the market, whether up or down." 
</P>
<P>
The key to investing, many experts say, will be in picking the right stocks 
that will perform well regardless of the overall market's direction. Shying 
away from the market completely -- as many investors have done -- could result 
in many missed opportunities, they say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Real Estate 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for home prices will continue to be mixed, with some markets 
remaining hot while others will stay behind, says John A. Tuccillo, chief 
economist for the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
In California, home prices will continue to post strong gains, although slower 
economic growth will dampen price hikes somewhat, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the influx of new residents, a strong economy and restrictions in new 
housing due to slow-growth measures, California boasted five of the 10 markets 
nationwide with the most price appreciation in 1988. Those five -- Orange 
County, San Diego, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and San Fernando 
Valley -- each posted gains of more than 15%, Tuccillo says. 
</P>
<P>
The Midwest also will show strong increases, but the Northeast and Oil Patch 
states will remain sluggish, Tuccillo says. 
</P>
<P>
As for office buildings and other commercial real estate, many markets remain 
soft due to overbuilding, slow economies and loss of tax breaks under tax 
reform. Accordingly, yields on many limited partnerships and real estate 
investment trusts have been declining. Investors must be careful, because with 
fewer tax breaks, real estate investments will have to make it largely on their 
economics. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have the tax factor working for you, so there is nothing to bail you 
out if you make a mistake," Tuccillo says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Precious Metals 
</P>
<P>
Gold and silver were among the top performers in 1987, but they flopped last 
year. And this year promises not to be much better, many experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Both gold and silver face plentiful supplies and only modest increases in 
demand. And inflation is expected to increase only modestly, dampening buying 
of metals for their traditional roles as inflation hedges. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, industrial demand for platinum is expected to rise, despite 
a recent announcement by Ford Motor that it had developed a platinum substitute 
in catalytic converters, which account for one third of worldwide demand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Collectibles 
</P>
<P>
In fine art, caution is the word for 1989. Prices continued to rise to dizzying 
heights last year, confounding many experts. Sotheby's, the big auction house, 
reported record or new record prices in Impressionist and Contemporary art, but 
strong rises even hit lower price categories. If history is any guide, this 
boom can't last forever, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Stamps, however, posted a modest year, but observers are encouraged by recent 
pickups in prices at auctions, says Elaine R. Boughner, managing editor of 
Linn's Stamp News. 
</P>
<P>
Many types of collector coins also gained only modestly. But rare, top 
investment-grade coins posted double-digit gains, as investors were encouraged 
by improved grading standards, says Keith M. Zaner, editor of Coin World 
Trends. More investors are expected to enter the market this year through new 
mutual funds or limited partnerships, Zaner says. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest collector market? Consider baseball cards. Prices of rare, 
mint-condition cards of such former greats as Mickey Mantle have increased more 
than five-fold in recent years.

<P>
What are the best investments for 1989? 
</P>
<P>
To answer that question, The Times asked five investment experts to decide how 
they would invest $10,000, in both conservative and risky portfolios. For the 
conservative portfolio, the experts assumed that $10,000 was all they had to 
invest, and thus they couldn't afford to lose any of it. For the risky 
portfolio, the experts assumed that $10,000 was part of a total $100,000 
portfolio, and thus they could afford to take capital losses. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the experts disagreed on the outlook for the stock market. 
But they all agreed that staying away from the market entirely would be a 
mistake because there are plenty of individual stocks or stock mutual funds 
that should do well, even if the market as a whole heads down. 
</P>
<P>
Here are their picks: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DONALD J. PHILLIPS 
</P>
<P>
Phillips is editor of Mutual Fund Values, a Chicago investment advisory service 
that evaluates performance, risk, expenses and other key measures for 1,082 
mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: With so much money on the sidelines, stocks and stock mutual funds 
should do well again in 1989, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Phillips slips $5,000 into Vanguard Short-Term Bond Fund, 
a no-load (no sales charge) mutual fund that invests in fixed-income securities 
with slightly longer maturities than those in money market funds. But the fund 
could return as much as 2 to 3 percentage points more than money funds, with 
virtually no risk of loss of principal, he says. It has posted average 
compounded annual returns of 10.41% in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips pops another $3,000 into T. Rowe Price New Income, a no-load fund with 
bonds of even longer maturities than the Vanguard fund. It has earned average 
compounded annual returns of 10.33% for the past 10 years. He tucks his last 
$2,000 into Strong Investment Fund, which he describes as one of the more 
conservative funds with exposure to stocks, which constitute up to 40% of its 
portfolio. It boasts an average compounded annual return of 10.72% in the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Phillips splits it equally into four stock funds. Two, Royce 
Value Trust and Gabelli Equity Trust, are relatively new "closed-end" funds 
whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange and are managed by 
well-respected money gurus Charles Royce and Mario Gabelli, respectively. As 
evidence of Royce's record, his older Pennsylvania Mutual fund has posted 
average annualized compounded returns of 19.54% for the past 10 years. Gabelli 
Asset Trust had gained 35.47% in the 12 months ended Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Phillips favors two no-load mutual funds. One is Nicholas Limited Edition, a 
2-year-old small-company stock fund managed by Albert Nicholas, whose older 
Nicholas Fund has posted a compounded annual return of 20.23% over the past 10 
years. The other is GIT Equity-Special Growth, another small-company fund that 
has posted a compounded annual return of 14.9% over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GERALDINE WEISS 
</P>
<P>
Weiss, editor and publisher of Investment Quality Trends, a La Jolla 
newsletter, is a leading expert on dividend-oriented investing. Her 
newsletter's recommendations were up 21.2% in 1988 through October, according 
to Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter that tracks performances of other 
newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: While the market as a whole has more room to fall than to gain, many 
stocks are undervalued and have little downside risk. The key is to find stocks 
whose dividend yields are at levels where their historical trading patterns 
show they were near the bottom in price and thus undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Weiss sticks to simplicity: She puts it all in insured 
savings accounts or certificates of deposit. She likes to keep her CD 
maturities staggered so that some cash is always coming available. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Weiss taps nine stocks. Her first choice, for $1,500, is 
Bristol-Myers, a company that consistently raises dividends and is historically 
undervalued with a dividend yield of about 4.5% (she considers 4% or more to be 
levels at which it is undervalued). For another $1,500 she taps Xerox, which is 
undergoing a turnaround, lowering costs and increasing profit margins. Its 
yield of 5.5% makes it highly undervalued. 
</P>
<P>
Weiss splits her remaining $7,000 equally among seven blue chip stocks that she 
considers to be close to undervalued levels, based on dividend yields. They are 
Schlumberger, Texas Utilities, Houston Industries, Baxter International, 
International Business Machines, American Medical International and Eastman 
Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN W. ROGERS JR. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, at age 30, is a rising young star in mutual fund management. His 
Calvert Ariel Growth, a small-company growth stock fund, was up 31.83% this 
year through Dec. 9, among the year's top performers. That followed a 11.4% 
rise in 1987, a strong gain in a year when the crash made losers of many stock 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Select stocks of quality companies that enjoy solid market shares in 
stable, non-cyclical businesses, but that are also undervalued and followed by 
few analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Rogers places $4,000 into money market funds. The rest 
goes into two conservatively managed stock mutual funds with excellent 
long-term reputations that he expects will continue to do well even in a down 
market. "It's nice to have growth as part of your portfolio," even if it's your 
first $10,000, he says. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers puts $4,000 of the remainder in Acorn Fund, a no-load fund with domestic 
and international stocks that has posted a compounded annual return of 18.78% 
in the past 10 years. The other $2,000 goes into Evergreen Total Return, a 
no-load stock and bond fund with a compounded annual return of 17.99% in the 
past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Rogers divides his risky $10,000 evenly between seven stocks. 
One of his favorites is Clorox, the bleach maker with a strong cash flow and 
balance sheet. Its share price has been beaten down somewhat by analysts' 
concerns that earnings will be negatively impacted by its planned rollout of a 
new detergent -- concerns that Rogers finds overblown and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
Rogers also likes McCormick &amp; Co., a spice concern flush with cash that 
seems to be followed by few analysts. Next he selects two office products 
stocks: United Stationers, the nation's largest distributor of office products, 
and Sanford, known for its markers and pens. 
</P>
<P>
He also picks two specialty packaging firms: Shorewood Packaging, the largest 
packager of records, compact discs, cassette tapes and music videos, and 
Sealright, the top ice cream packager. Finally, he taps SEI, a large pension 
fund consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOLA MADDOX FALCONE 
</P>
<P>
Falcone is co-manager of Evergreen Total Return, a stock and bond mutual fund 
that's among the top performers among so-called growth and income funds that 
seek capital gains as well as dividend income. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: The stock market will be sluggish, but real undervalued stocks with 
strong dividend yields will hold up well. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Falcone puts $5,000 in two-year Treasury notes, currently 
yielding about 9.11%, higher than 30-year Treasury bonds. She tucks the other 
$5,000 into a money market fund. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Falcone puts it into three "depressed" stocks with good yields 
that will limit downside risk. "I wouldn't mind putting my mother into these," 
she says. The first $4,500 goes into Bristol-Myers, a company misperceived by 
investors who don't realize that it has turned into a high-growth drug company 
with exciting new products in such fields as cancer treatment and orthopedics, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Falcone slips another $2,500 into First Fidelity Bancorp, whose stock was 
pushed down following a recent announcement of a huge writeoff due to poor 
loans. The negative reaction has been overdone, she says. As a extra bonus, the 
stock yields about 7.7%. 
</P>
<P>
Her last $3,000 goes to Springs Industries, a towel and comforter maker that 
recently bought a company that makes industrial fabric used in electronic 
circuit boards, aerospace construction and marine industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JOHN D. CONNOLLY 
</P>
<P>
Connolly is chairman of the investment policy committee at Dean Witter 
Reynolds, currently among the most bullish of Wall Street investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
Outlook: Stocks will do well largely because interest rates will begin to 
decline in coming months. At that point, he says, investors will pull money out 
of short-term fixed-income investments and put it into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative $10,000: Connolly socks it simply into one-year CDs, which have a 
better return than Treasury bills. "If you can't afford to lose, you can't 
afford to play" with stocks and other higher-risk, higher-return investments, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Risky $10,000: Connolly divides it equally among five stocks that he considers 
undervalued with price-earnings ratios (stock price divided by earnings per 
share) far under what he thinks they should be. 
</P>
<P>
The first, Price Co., is a retailer that he expects to enjoy 25% earnings 
growth. Next he tabs Computer Associates, the nation's biggest independent 
supplier of systems software. 
</P>
<P>
Connolly also likes H. F. Ahmanson, a strong savings and loan firm that could 
benefit from lower interest rates and a resolution of troubles plaguing the 
S&amp;L federal deposit insurance system. His fourth pick is Schering-Plough, a 
drug firm that he expects will post 20% annual earnings growth in the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
His final selection is Monsanto, a chemical and drug firm that has been hurt by 
adverse rulings on an intrauterine device. It is selling far under the price 
shareholders would get if the company was broken up, Connolly says.

In the advertising industry, 1989 may best be described as the year of the 
poacher. Because most executives are expecting billings growth of only 6% to 
7%, there are increasing suspicions that the only sure-fire way to grow larger 
in 1989 will be to steal the business from someone else. 
</P>
<P>
Already, a slew of agencies are chasing after all or parts of the $200- million 
Burger King business that is now up for grabs. And in mid-December, 
Admarketing, a Los Angeles ad agency, dumped the $15-million HomeClub ad 
business in order to take away the more lucrative, $25-million Home Depot 
advertising account from a competitor. 
</P>
<P>
Also, as advertising giants like Kraft, Pillsbury and RJR Nabisco continue to 
mix it up in the buyout arena, a number of client conflicts could arise, 
forcing some ad agencies to make tough decisions on which clients to keep -- 
and how to keep all clients happy. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, advertising executives expect that their clients will continue to 
spend more money on various forms of sales promotion and direct marketing -- 
and less in more conventional forms of advertising such as network television 
and radio. BRUCE HOROVITZ

The cable television industry should continue to show large profits with the 
higher rates now charged for basic service. Prospects for local TV station 
advertising revenues remains open, however, with some experts predicting a year 
of small or flat growth. The national broadcast advertising that sustains the 
TV networks is expected to rise a slight 4.5%. With as many as 30 network 
affiliate stations up for sale, prices paid for stations may be sharply down, 
after the go-go advances of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the newspaper business have been candidly predicting a couple of tough 
years ahead, because of the rising cost of newsprint and postage, as well as 
the recession that many economists expect to begin in the second half of 1989. 
In addition, the merger boom of recent years has reduced the volume of 
advertising done by such key newspaper clients as supermarkets and department 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
In book publishing, a shining light may be the textbook segment, which is 
expected to be helped by demand from the baby boom "echo" -- the children of 
baby boomers, now entering school in growing numbers. Some analysts are looking 
for the general aging of the American population to also help popular hardback 
sales, since older people are the most avid readers. PAUL RICHTER

Shoppers can look forward to some bargains in the coming year. That's because 
retailers, after a spate of buyouts and mergers, are loaded with debt and must 
focus on short-term cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's consolidation is expected to continue apace in 1989, with more 
linkups between real estate developers and merchants, similar to last year's 
epic joining of Toronto development firm Campeau Corp. and Federated Department 
Stores. Mergers and store closings, with resultant loss of jobs, can be 
expected particularly in areas such as Denver and Houston that are still 
afflicted by oil-related woes. 
</P>
<P>
At stores that are trying to boost profit margins such as Bullock's (now owned 
by R. H. Macy &amp; Co.) and Robinson's (a May Department Stores division), 
more development of private label merchandise will be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, pent-up demand should lead to a modest rebound in the women's 
clothing business, which has been in the doldrums for well over a year. 
(However, any improvement there would be offset by weakness in hard goods.) The 
return to classic, feminine fashions bodes well for accessories. MARTHA GROVES

In personal computers, look for more and better sound. Increasingly, PCs are 
coming equipped with special sound chips that alow them to "talk," provide 
special sound effects for games and even play music on compact discs. Compact 
discs will also become a more popular form of storing data. Erasable optical 
discs are also expected to hit the market for the first time in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Personal computers will also increasingly use the Unix operating system, a 
sophisticated software base developed nearly two decades ago in the 
laboratories of AT&amp;T. Until the last couple of years, Unix had been used 
primarily on large computer systems, but with the increasing power of 
microprocessors, the PC is now able to take full advantage of this complex and 
powerful system. 
</P>
<P>
This year is also expected to see the arrival of portable digital audio tape 
players from Japan, where they are already extremely popular. Cellular 
telephones are expected to be one of the most popular consumer electronics 
items in 1989. Experts expect them to drop significantly in both price and 
size. CARLA LAZZARESCHI

INNOVATIVE DESIGNS CAN ENLIVEN EVEN THOSE DIFFICULT BUILDINGS

What's an architect to do when designing a building for a socially undesirable 
or an aesthetically ugly activity? 
</P>
<P>
"Do you disguise, say, a sewage treatment plant's function by prettying it up 
with fake mansard roofs and roses 'round the door?" architect Anthony Lumsden 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Or do you take the more sophisticated route of developing a design that 
honestly expresses what goes on inside, and find a way to turn that action into 
interesting architecture?" 
</P>
<P>
Lumsden, who advocates the latter, is chief of design for Daniel, Mann, Johnson 
&amp; Mendenhall, an engineering and architecture company overseeing the 
$600-million modernization of the Hyperion waste-water treatment plant in El 
Segundo. By 1998, the firm will have supervised the completion of more than 40 
new buildings at the site, part of the city's $2-billion public works program 
to upgrade Los Angeles' ailing sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
"Hyperion has always been shrouded in mystery," said Mary Anne Pierson, 
recently appointed to develop a public tour program of the 144-acre facility 
wedged between the city of El Segundo and Dockweiler State Beach. "To most 
people it's a smelly place where dirty things happen -- a kind of pollution 
factory. Hyperion's function is so unattractive, the place is not even named on 
the standard Thomas Bros. city map." 
</P>
<P>
That negative image will change with Hyperion's new generation of architecture, 
Pierson believes. 
</P>
<P>
One of Lumsden's first designs is the warehouse and maintenance facility on the 
prominent corner where Imperial Highway joins Vista del Mar Boulevard. The 
long, low, largely windowless building, soon to be completed, is enlivened with 
imaginatively sloped metal-clad roof surfaces, curved stucco walls and bold 
primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
"The structure's shapes are sculpted into forms that engage the eye of the 
passing motorist," Lumsden explained. "Instead of the usual boring industrial 
facility, we have a building that adds to the streetscape without pretending to 
be a nursing home or an upscale shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
Other structures being built by the firm include a 200-foot-long compressor 
building that sits between the aeration basins where the active organic 
"sludge" is blasted with high-pressure oxygen and "clarified" for secondary 
treatment into inert matter. Sleek yet muscular, the compressor building's 
aluminum rooftop drums and loops of high-tech piping give the impression of a 
clean yet honest energy that does not deny the building's function. 
</P>
<P>
Lumsden and his firm are not neophytes in the art of transforming ugly duckling 
buildings into architectural swans. Many designers regard the Tillman Water 
Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area of Van Nuys, built by 
DMJM in 1984, as the most attractive public service facility in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Set in a Japanese garden, the Tillman administration and laboratory building is 
the centerpiece of a plant that recycles waste water. Lumsden's trademark 
sloped metal roofs and sleek concrete curves express the building's technical 
function, yet integrate the design into a park-like landscape. 
</P>
<P>
"At Tillman we made an architectural play of glass and metal folds and ripples 
wrapped around an exposed structural skeleton," he said. "This envelope 
cascades over the building's bare bones as a metaphor for the facility's 
water-reclaiming activity." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Spirit 
</P>
<P>
Tillman's acclaim sparked a new spirit among those concerned with the 
architecture of the city's public service projects. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Department of Water and Power has upgraded the design 
level of many of its sprawling facilities. An architectural exhibit in the 
DWP's downtown headquarters displays five major planned developments crafted to 
a standard well above the department's post-World War II norm. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley Generating Station in Altadena by Miralles Associates Inc., the 
Valley District Headquarters in Van Nuys by Ellerbe-Becket Associates, and the 
Sun Valley District Headquarters by Leason Pomeroy Associates are among the 
best of the new DWP designs. All of these potentially unattractive projects 
manage the difficult trick of being architecturally honest and aesthetically 
pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past the DWP often showed us buildings that were, quite frankly, 
hokey," said Merry Norris, president of the city's Cultural Affairs Commission, 
which has the statutory right of design approval over all buildings proposed on 
public land. "They were so dishonest in character -- generating stations 
masquerading as country clubs, for instance -- that we had to reject them out 
of hand." 
</P>
<P>
According to the commission's architectural guidelines, the design of any 
city-financed building must be "true to the nature of the activities it 
contains," use the best materials available within the budget and take account 
of the buildings, streets and landscapes that surround it "to create pleasant 
environments for people who may work in the project and for those who visit and 
pass by." 
</P>
<P>
In the last year or so, Norris said, the DWP has made "a truly herculean effort 
to raise the level of its submissions to the commission. It's truly marvelous 
that the public sector has at last begun to set an example of architectural and 
social quality in its projects." 
</P>
<P>
The Cultural Affairs Commission also has become far more involved in the issues 
of quality design, observed William Gossy, senior architect for the DWP's 
design and construction division. "The result is that, in the 26 years I've 
been here, I've seldom seen such excitement about good architecture generated 
within the department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several designers recently engaged by the DWP and the Board of Public Works 
credited the Cultural Affairs Commission for greatly strengthening their hands 
in dealing with the city's public service facility bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"The commission kept rejecting bad designs until the agencies got the message," 
Lumsden said. "The priority of public architecture has been lifted from the 
dumps to the top of the pile. Ugliness and dishonesty are out the window, at 
last."

FOR SHIRLEY TEMPLE BLACK, A REPRISE OF A STAR ROLE IN PASADENA 50 YEARS LATER 
BRINGS A PARADE OF MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A youngish TV reporter settled himself opposite Shirley Temple Black in the 
parlor of Tournament House in Pasadena, where she was sailing cheerily through 
a morning of obligatory interviews, and suggested for openers, that, good 
grief, she'd been around forever and now she was grand marshal of the Rose 
Parade for the second time, after Fifty years and. . . . 
</P>
<P>
To which Black, who is now 60, replied, enjoying her own joke, "Yes, I'm one of 
the oldest living Americans." 
</P>
<P>
An American icon at an age when most Americans aren't yet collecting Social 
Security checks, Black is not one to dwell in the past. As she puts it, 
"Looking over my shoulder is not my style." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, she was the dimpled charmer who lifted Depression-era spirits and 
sat on the laps of so many world leaders that, she later observed, "It's a 
wonder I ever learned to walk." 
</P>
<P>
Today, she is more apt to be talking about peace, help for the homeless and the 
hungry, preservation of the environment, halting the AIDS epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Nippy, Overcast Day 
</P>
<P>
But on this particular morning, two days before today's centennial Rose Parade, 
Black was happy to reminisce: It was Jan. 2, 1939, and the adorable 10-year-old 
moppet, wearing a white ermine coat with matching muff, a white hat atop her 
perfect curls, was riding as grand marshal at the head of the 50th Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
She recalled: "The float I was on was spectacular, covered with roses" (2,500, 
shading from red to pink) with a dais of gardenias, "my favorite flower." The 
day was nippy and overcast -- rain would hold off until the parade had ended -- 
but, Black said, "there was a little heater at my feet, covered with flowers. 
It was cozy and warm and everything smelled beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"I waved diligently for about 2 1/2 hours," she added, noting she learned to 
cover the record crowd of 1.2 million along the route by adopting the "Queen of 
England" technique, tracing a slow, sweeping arc with one arm. "You can get a 
whole lot of people that way. And I love all people. There are some I don't 
like, but I love all people." 
</P>
<P>
She also "loved the horses and the beautiful saddles and all the silver." 
(Three years earlier, she had been given her first horse, a Shetland pony she 
named Spunky.) 
</P>
<P>
And she "loved" being the grand marshal and wearing a big badge with a rosette 
even though, prodded now for more details, she summarized it like the pro she 
always was: "It was dark. I was taken to the float and put on it. And I did my 
job. My car, or truck, or whatever it was under all those flowers, didn't break 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents had insisted on security precautions, and safe she was, with Leo 
Carrillo, "one of my best friends," riding his horse close by. He gave her a 
Western outfit, chaps and all, and, she says, "I still have it." Clopping along 
right behind her float was Los Angeles Sheriff Eugene Biscaluiz with his 
mounted posse. 
</P>
<P>
It was, by all reports, a spectacular parade -- 5 miles long, with 65 floats 
and 18 bands, a spectacle of such proportions that one journalist was moved to 
write, "The 1939 Tournament of Roses probably never will be excelled." 
</P>
<P>
The flower-decked floats had drawn gasps from spectators. Santa Barbara had 
entered a Taj Mahal; Laguna Beach had recreated Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last 
Supper." Camp Baldy's entry had depicted Whistler's Mother. Burbank had rolled 
off with the sweepstakes for its tally-ho pulled by four prancing snow-white 
floral steeds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
She Likes to Steer 
</P>
<P>
But what was Shirley Temple thinking as she rode at the head of that parade? 
Well, she recalls, "I knew I was part of a very important tradition." Then she 
added, "And I would have preferred to steer. I like to steer everything, 
trains, boats. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
And, as she had earlier told the crowd at Pasadena Kiwanis Club's 1989 kick-off 
luncheon, being grand marshal "has a few disadvantages. It is no job for 
someone who likes to march. I really loved to march." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she observed, "You don't get to see the parade, all that happens back 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Having said all that, she was, Black emphasized, "thrilled" when 1989 
Tournament of Roses President John H. Biggar III came calling at the Blacks' 
home in Woodside in Northern California with an invitation to be grand marshal 
once again. Her answer, she said, was an "instant yes." 
</P>
<P>
When Lathrop K. Leishman, tournament president in 1939, was looking for a grand 
marshal, he recalls in "Tournament of Roses: The First 100 Years," a centennial 
history, "There was no name in America as big as Shirley Temple. . . . I 
decided she should be our grand marshal -- if we could get her." 
</P>
<P>
They got her, thus scoring the coup of having as grand marshal the child star 
who had been No. 1 at the box office for four straight years, topping such 
superstars as Clark Gable and Robert Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
And as Biggar noted at this year's kickoff luncheon, the theme for today's 
parade is "Celebration 100" and the committee wanted a grand marshal who would 
"express the tradition" of the parade. It also sought "a celebration-type 
person, cheerful, uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
Reenter, Shirley Temple Black. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Purple Power Suit' 
</P>
<P>
But this is 1989, and this time around the grand marshal won't be wearing 
ermine. 
</P>
<P>
"The (anti-) fur people wouldn't like it," she says. Instead, she has opted to 
wear what she calls her "purple power suit," bought on her recent 21-city tour 
to promote her autobiography, when she discovered that her 
black-and-white-checked number was dizzying on TV. 
</P>
<P>
And, riding beside her, at Black's request, will be her only grandchild, Teresa 
Falaschi, an 8-year-old who has promised her "Nana" that she will sit suitably 
still. 
</P>
<P>
"Teresa said to me, 'Do I have to ride in the buggy? I'd rather do gymnastics 
all the way.' " Black noted. "She's very energetic." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feels Like Child Again 
</P>
<P>
Two horses will pull the grand marshal's surrey -- a conveyance about which 
Temple said, "I guess it befits my age" -- and, as it will seat three, she 
hoped to have her daughter, Susan Falaschi, 40, ride along. Black's husband, 
businessman Charles Black, will be in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
It is not hard to believe Black when she says she feels once again like "a 
child of 10, wide-eyed with honor." She plunged into pre-parade festivities and 
duties with contagious enthusiasm, answering repetitive media questions with 
grace and humor, tossing one-liners, occasionally slipping in a word for her 
book, "Child Star." 
</P>
<P>
She is eager to know how the book reads, mentioning that author Wallace 
Stegner, a friend and neighbor, got her on track, telling her she needed a 
story line to tie together her anecdotes and insisting that she "get rid of the 
dangling participles." 
</P>
<P>
One of those charming anecdotes is about New Year's Eve, 1938, when Shirley and 
a girlfriend, who was spending the night, were whisked off to bed early so 
Shirley would be rested for her role as grand marshal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Watched Horror Thriller 
</P>
<P>
But the girls were determined to crash her parents' anniversary party, in 
progress below. On their third try, they managed to thwart a photoelectric beam 
that protected Shirley's bedroom at the Brentwood home from intruders. 
</P>
<P>
Creeping down the circular staircase, they peered into the darkened living room 
where guests were watching "Night Must Fall," a horror thriller starring Robert 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
In the film, "They were carrying somebody's head around in a hatbox," she 
recalls, adding that she promptly had nightmares about a body-less head. She 
laughs and says, "I had all of New Year's Day to recover." 
</P>
<P>
"Child Star" is no sordid Hollywood tell-all, though Black does write candidly 
about the breakup of her 1945 marriage to John Agar, describing him as a 
drinker and a womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
She also sets the record straight on her wealth: All but $44,000 of the $3.4 
million she earned has disappeared, largely as a result of mishandling by her 
father, George, who died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
But, she is quick to say now, she does not blame him. He was, she says, a man 
of limited education, "an innocent led to slaughter" by advisers. No, she has 
"no regrets" about the lost millions. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other celebrities, Black did not want to write about what she describes 
as "all that psychological stuff -- who am I? Where am I going?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Well-Adjusted Woman 
</P>
<P>
She laughs and says, "I started so young, I didn't have to ask." (At age 3, 
little Shirley was plucked from a Santa Monica dancing school and cast in a 
series of low-budget one -- reelers called "Baby Burlesks.") Black now refers 
to this as her "starlet" period, before being signed by Fox at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
What is perhaps most astonishing about Shirley Temple Black is that she matured 
into such a well-adjusted, focused woman. This, after all, was the child who 
taught fractions to Noel Coward, played croquet with Orson Welles, handed out 
Oscars to Disney's seven dwarfs, the child whose doll look-alikes added up to 
$45 million in sales for Ideal Toy and Novelty Co. of New York by 1941. 
</P>
<P>
How did she do it? "I had a super mother," she says. "She kept my head on 
straight." (Gertrude Temple also rolled every one of Shirley's 56 famous 
sausage curls each day and, with two secretaries, answered her fan mail.) 
</P>
<P>
Mother Temple "just dusted off" the adulation, Black said, always explaining to 
her daughter that what people admired was her work. Shirley never saw the fan 
letters. And, each day when she left the Fox lot, she remembers, "I'd get off 
the little frilly dress," pull on jeans "and climb trees" or play cops 'n' 
robbers with the neighborhood boys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ran Before Horses 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "tomboy" and "jock," Black was never more thrilled than during 
the filming of "Wee Willie Winkie," (1937) when, eschewing a double, she ran 
before a herd of stampeding horses. John Ford was the director, she says, and 
"he liked to direct men." But from then on, she added, "he started treating me 
as a macho kid." 
</P>
<P>
She lists that film as one of two favorites among all those she made from her 
first in 1931 to her last in 1949, chiefly "because I got to march so much." 
Her second favorite was "The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer" (1947), largely 
because "Cary Grant was just super to work with." 
</P>
<P>
Watching Black in action -- a poised, outgoing woman in a happy second marriage 
of 38 years, with three grown children, a woman who refers to herself as "a 
good wife, that's No. 1," an observer can't help but make comparisons to 
today's young stars, many of whom are plagued by alcohol and drug problems and 
lifelong conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about 1939 Hollywood, she reflected on it as "a time of innocence." 
Reporters did not probe celebrities' private lives, she says, and "everybody 
was idolized." She looks back on "an enchanted childhood." 
</P>
<P>
She pauses before another interview at Tournament House and checks to see if 
she has remembered to remove the price tag from the new, long white sweater 
with a pattern of stylized red roses that she is wearing over a black leather 
skirt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Practicing Spanish Phrase 
</P>
<P>
Those are apt to be the only red roses she'll get very close to. Yes, she is 
allergic to them, "not the pink ones," just the red ones. Next, for an 
interview with a Spanish language station, she is practicing, in Spanish, how 
to say "Happy New Year." 
</P>
<P>
To a radio reporter from Michigan, she expresses her disappointment that her 
book tour did not take her to Detroit -- "I've never been to Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
In another interview, she demurs on a question about whether she prefers 
Northern California to Southern California, where she was born, saying, "I like 
the whole state." 
</P>
<P>
Will she be rooting for USC or Michigan when she tosses the coin for the team 
captains before today's game? "I'm a diplomat. However, I was born in 
California. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ambassador to Ghana 
</P>
<P>
Black is a professional diplomat, having been during 19 years of government 
service U.S. ambassador to the West African nation of Ghana, a stint she looks 
back on as "the best job of my whole life," as well as a U.S. delegate to the 
United Nations and U.S. chief of protocol, the first woman to hold that job. 
</P>
<P>
One interviewer refers to her years as an "ambassadress" and she gently 
corrects him, explaining she was "an ambassador. Ambassadress is what you 
wear." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, she is fielding another question about her, well, normalcy. "Life has 
been very fair to me," she says. "I've had a very fulfilling life." Yes, there 
have been "some bad times, some sad times," including breast cancer surgery in 
1972, a personal crisis she shared with the world in hopes of encouraging other 
women to have checkups. 
</P>
<P>
People come and go, the room filling with pleasant, low-key banter. Someone 
makes a good-natured reference to her as "The Little Colonel," one of her 
famous film roles, and Black shoots back, "I'm a general now, and a grand 
marshal. Watch it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lost Congressional Race 
</P>
<P>
Then she is talking sports with ABC's Tim McCarver, telling him she's "a good 
shot" (targets only). 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hunt quail," she says later, "but I love Bush." (A lifelong 
Republican, Black ran for Congress in 1967, losing in the primary to Paul 
McCloskey Jr. She was a first-time delegate this year to the GOP National 
Convention.) 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, someone asks what if -- what if it rains today on her parade. It 
won't, she replies. "As an ambassador, nothing perturbs you. If it rains, I'll 
get wet. You'll never know it."

A FINE POLITICAL SEA TALE IN AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN SEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Wilful Woman by Michael Talbot (Knopf: $18.95; 354 pages) 
</P>
<P>
"A Wilful Woman" is second in a closely researched series of serious, 
sophisticated and intelligent historical novels recording the settlement of 
Australia. But -- since the characters here are still calling this land "New 
Holland" and referring to aboriginals as "Indians" -- this story has much less 
to do with the matter of Australia as such than with English politics and 
seafaring in the 18th Century. Those readers who remember (or still read) the 
C. S. Forester novels, particularly the wonderful early Capt. Horatio 
Hornblower ones like "Beat to Quarters" and "Ship of the Line" will be crazy 
about "A Wilful Woman." 
</P>
<P>
For those who grew up on Forester (remember, that's C. S. Forester, not E. M. 
Forster), there's nothing more fun than a leaky ship that's gone around a 
couple of capes, stays "hoveto" for pages at a time and makes a perfect 
landfall with the aid of nothing more than dead reckoning and a couple of 
aspirin. It's the mark of a more perfect and simple world, where you've got the 
easy-going (but cool and hip) Blue Jackets, Navy Men, set against the klutzy, 
rule-bound Red Coat Marines, who hate to be on board a ship, don't know how to 
get in or out of a dinghy, live to slaughter innocent passers-by and have bad 
personalities besides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Complimentary Commander 
</P>
<P>
This is the kind of novel where the commander of the fleet -- in this case, 
Arthur Phillip, is always "sending his compliments" to some unlucky officer, 
then having a tantrum about why this hasn't been done or that hasn't been done. 
Also the kind of novel that's rife with scoundrels -- in this case they range 
from (1) the churlish, humorless, Robert Ross, commander of the marines, who 
spends all his time building Ft. Ross and figuring out how Cmdr. Arthur Phillip 
might catch some kind of pox and keel over and die, so that he, Robert Ross, 
might become commander of this very biggest -- yet least known -- colony of the 
British Empire, New Holland, to (2) Buck Nash, a former Buckingham Palace 
wastrel, an idle, mean-spirited courtier, who got convicted for wife-stealing 
and was subsequently "transported," who also wants Cmdr. Phillip out of the 
way, for reasons of his own. 
</P>
<P>
The backdrop here is the very beginning of the founding of the Sydney Harbor 
Colony. The plot moves along on three levels: (1) Who's going to win 
ascendancy, Arthur Phillip or Robert Ross? (2) What about all those convicts, 
especially, what about the women? With a ratio of one-to-six in favor of the 
stronger sex, won't all these women, even the one respectable married lady, end 
up raped, murdered and pillaged? And (3) who, of the sundry male convicts, will 
be successful in the colonies and end up becoming a pillar of the state? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kitty's Coalitions 
</P>
<P>
"A Wilful Woman" (the woman in question here is an ex-actress named Kitty 
Brandon, who spends most of her time setting up coalitions between unlikely 
characters), presents an interesting literary or "writerly" challenge. As in 
Michael Wilding's "The Paraguayan Experiment," the prose here moves between 
actual documents of the day, weird, hard-to-read, bureaucratic officialese, and 
plenty of the spoken word in dialogue. But how did officials, prostitutes, 
criminals and marines actually speak in the 18th Century? I'm willing to take 
C. S. Forester's word about how British naval officers talked: After Capt. 
Horatio Hornblower, how could I not? But I had trouble with some of the 
convicts here and with Kitty Brandon herself. That doesn't matter much. This is 
a wonderful book to read, an acerbic antidote to the holidays, a book full of 
low crime, undug latrines and ruffled dignity. 
</P>
<P>
The reviewer presents her compliments to the intelligent readership of the Los 
Angeles Times and respectfully suggests that it take under consideration for 
purchase, Michael Talbot's "A Wilful Woman."

PAT SAJAK AND ARSENIO HALL ENTER THE NIGHTTIME FRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Johnny Carson and David Letterman made it. But not Alan Thicke, Joan Rivers, 
Paul Robins and Phil Cowan, et al. The late-night TV arena and trivia books are 
littered with the bodies of Carson challengers, but that hasn't stopped Pat 
Sajak and Arsenio Hall. This month they plunge into the highly competitive time 
slot after the 11 o'clock news. (Answer to trivia question No. 1: Robins and 
Cowan hosted the late "The Wilton North Report" on Fox Broadcasting.) 
</P>
<P>
Both Sajak, congenial host of "Wheel of Fortune," America's favorite game show, 
and Hall, who broke into late night last year as a guest host on Fox's 
now-defunct "Late Show," plan to avoid direct competition with the mighty 
Carson "Tonight Show." Both say they'll try to provide something completely 
different. 
</P>
<P>
Marla Kell Brown, producer of "The Arsenio Hall Show" points out that 
competition in late-night television is somewhat different from that during 
other "dayparts," as the networks dub the different time periods. 
</P>
<P>
In prime time, for example, the competition is the other networks. In late 
night, "your biggest competition is sleep," said Brown, who worked with Hall 
during his "Late Show" stint after Joan Rivers' ouster. 
</P>
<P>
Sajak, who makes his CBS late-night debut next Monday at 11:30 p.m. with the 
appropriately titled "Pat Sajak Show," and Hall, whose syndicated "Arsenio Hall 
Show" premieres Tuesday at 11 p.m. on KCOP Channel 13 in Los Angeles, say they 
don't plan to unseat NBC's Carson and Letterman, ABC's "Nightline" or even go 
head-to-head with each other. 
</P>
<P>
They just want to find their own audience among the available pool of 
late-night viewers and keep them from falling asleep over their bedtime snacks. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to worry about Arsenio; we're not going to worry about Carson 
and 'Nightline,' either. We just have to do what feels best for Pat," insisted 
Sajak producer Paul Gilbert in a recent conversation at CBS, where the network 
spent between $4 million and $5 million constructing a new sound stage and 
other facilities for "The Pat Sajak Show," the network's first late-night 
effort since 1972, when it canceled Merv Griffin's show. 
</P>
<P>
Ask the people behind "The Arsenio Hall Show" whether they're drawing up battle 
plans and they give the same answer. "Hopefully there's enough room for 
everybody," said Frank Kelly, senior vice president of programming at Paramount 
Television, where the show is produced. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hall: "I think people place too much emphasis on the competition; I'm 
running my own race. It's a personal best, it's me against me. I'm on after 
Sajak in Chicago (the show airs at various times in different cities) so I want 
him to do well." 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe there's just a little competitive sentiment. "The demographic that 
knows Sajak from daytime TV is people who should be asleep (at 11:30). His 
people are asleep," Hall noted smugly in an interview at his office at 
Paramount. "He probably would do well with a morning talk show. That's what I 
would have done with him if I were a CBS executive." 
</P>
<P>
The Carson camp refused comment on their new competitors. But Robert Morton, 
producer of "Late Night With David Letterman," said there's truth in the notion 
that dissimilar late-night shows pose little threat to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'd be crazy not to care that they're out there," Morton said. "(But) 
there are some shows that, when they're faced with severe competition, are in 
an out-and-out battle -- witness the morning shows, how many different ones CBS 
has tried. I don't think it's that intense with the late-night shows. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we've had Pat Sajak on 'Letterman,' talking about 'The Pat Sajak 
Show,' There is, of course, a competitive spirit. But on the other hand, I 
think he'll bring another audience to late night -- his daytime viewers. That 
can only be helpful to late night. (If) they like his show, maybe they'll turn 
to our show." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Sajak, however, Hall has not been a guest on "Letterman." "I was booked 
(on the show), and then, the day of the announcement that I was going to have 
my own show, they canceled me," Hall said. "At first I wasn't upset about it, 
because this is war. Then I heard that Sajak was on the show. Maybe they don't 
consider Sajak competition . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Morton denies playing favorites. "We don't care about competing shows 
as far as booking -- we have guests from the other networks all the time," he 
said huffily. He acknowledged, however, that Hall was originally booked for one 
"Letterman" date, which Hall himself canceled because he had a schedule 
conflict. The only other date Hall had available was nixed because it fell too 
close to the debut date of "The Arsenio Hall Show." "We just thought it would 
looked a little strange to have him one place, and then another right away," 
Morton countered. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not Hall and Sajak are deliberately competing -- or which one gets 
an on-air audience with David Letterman -- the pair have definitely assigned 
themselves a difficult task: trying to be different from each other and the 
rest of the pack without really breaking any of the comfortable late-night 
conventions that have made Jack Paar, Carson, Letterman and others bright stars 
long after the moon comes up over Television Land. 
</P>
<P>
And now, he-e-e-re's Pat and Arsenio. . . . Host: Pat Sajak. (Caucasian male, 
42, "Wheel of Fortune" host. Weatherman for Los Angeles' KNBC-TV 1977-81 and 
prior to that at WSMV-TV in Nashville.) 
</P>
<P>
Network: CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Time: 11:30 p.m. Running Time: 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sidekick: Yes (Dan Miller, former news anchor and Sajak colleague in Nashville; 
briefly held an anchor position at Los Angeles' KCBS-TV in 1986, but was fired 
following a messy management coup at the station). 
</P>
<P>
Studio Orchestra: Yes (The Tom Scott Band, all-male, jazz-rock-fusion). 
</P>
<P>
Desk for the host: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Style: Neo-Jack Paar. Broad demographic appeal. Guests ranging from show-biz 
superstars to political figures, authors, scientists and the man- or 
woman-in-the-street. Sajak, who worshiped Paar as pre-Carson host of "The 
Tonight Show" while a child growing up in Chicago, hopes to bring back the good 
old days of late-night talk -- when guests were entertaining, conversation was 
gracious and nobody ever broke the host's nose by throwing a chair at him. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the producers of the "Pat Sajak Show" considered a radical move: 
Instead of seating guests on the left side of Sajak's desk -- the way Johnny 
Carson does on "The Tonight Show" -- Sajak's people wanted to put guests on the 
right side, just to make things a little different. 
</P>
<P>
They decided against it. "I swear, it was like looking into a mirror, we're so 
used to seeing it the other way," said Sajak. "It just looked weird." 
</P>
<P>
Weird is the last thing "The Pat Sajak Show" wants to be. It enters late-night 
TV with the philosophy that the traditional talk-show format is not broken and 
needs no fixing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the show's producers seek to minimize Sajak's identification with 
"Wheel of Fortune," the new Pat Sajak will basically be the old Pat Sajak. 
Coordinating producer David Williger said any image changes will be subtle, if 
detectable. Sajak usually wears double-breasted suitcoats and a pocket 
handkerchief on "Wheel." On "Sajak," he will wear mostly single-breasted coats 
sans handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Mischler, CBS vice president of advertising promotions, described the 
show's promotional campaign as equally low-key to avoid what he calls 
"anticipointment" -- or unrealistic viewer expectations. "The problem with that 
is, they watch the first night and they never come back again," he said. 
"That's why 'Thicke of the Night' failed; they trumpeted the Second Coming, and 
there was no Second Coming." 
</P>
<P>
Sajak considered the idea of having no sidekick. He considered the idea of 
having a woman sidekick -- but after years on "Wheel" opposite Vanna White, 
decided that viewers might find another woman disconcerting, "as though Vanna 
and I had gotten a divorce or something" (although Sajak will be replaced on 
the daytime "Wheel of Fortune" by ex-football star Rolf Benirschke, he will 
continue to host the night-time show). 
</P>
<P>
Sajak also thought the good-natured ribbing between male host and female 
sidekick might be misconstrued: "If I'm needling some guy, it's two guys having 
fun -- but if I'm needling a woman, I'm a cad, and if she's needling me, she's 
a bitch," Sajak said. Eventually he settled on old friend Dan Miller, a 
quintessential authoritative newscaster whose towering height and rich 
Nashville-tinged voice provides vivid contrast to Sajak's elfin charm and quick 
wit. 
</P>
<P>
Sajak said the show will make ample use of CBS' location in the Fairfax 
district, conducting live interviews from the studio via microwave link-ups 
with the locals, from melon merchants at Farmer's Market to the punks of 
Melrose Avenue. The producers have purchased a helicopter to pay impromptu 
visits to earthquake sites and other areas of note. Sajak plans to do for CBS 
Television City what Carson did for beautiful downtown Burbank. And Steve Allen 
once did for Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Although "Sajak" producers eventually hope to develop their own signature bits 
along the lines of Letterman's "Stupid Pet Tricks," Sajak plans to keep his 
show traditional -- even returning to the 90-minute format earlier used by Paar 
and Carson to allow guests enough time to develop a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was at Jack Paar's house a couple of weeks ago, and we watched some of his 
old shows," Sajak said. "You can't do it quite the same way anymore -- things 
have changed, attention spans have shortened. But you can get a little of that 
flavor. The one thing we did not do was say, 'What can we do to break new 
ground, what can we do to be radical?' This format has been working in one form 
or another for 35 years." Host: Arsenio Hall. (Black male, 30, most popular 
guest host of Fox Broadcasting's "Late Show Starring Joan Rivers" following 
Rivers' ouster. Turned down regular hosting position on "Late Show" to pursue 
movie career; most recently starred with best friend Eddie Murphy in the 
box-office hit "Coming to America.") 
</P>
<P>
Network: Syndicated. 
</P>
<P>
Time: In Los Angeles, 11 p.m. on KCOP Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
Running Time: 60 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sidekick: No. 
</P>
<P>
Studio Orchestra: Yes (Hall describes the band as unusual because it features 
women: "I have a sexy lady on drums, I have a sexy lady on keyboard" . . . ). 
</P>
<P>
Desk: Absolutely not. 
</P>
<P>
Style: Hall plans to create the hipness of Letterman without his hard-edged 
cynicism. Hall describes himself as just a star-struck boy from Cleveland 
beneath all the Hollywood glitter. Although guests will be wide-ranging, as on 
"Sajak," Hall expects his show to have a slightly younger demographic appeal 
due to his own freewheeling, desk-less approach to interviewing. Hall boldly 
calls himself "The Martin Luther King of comedy," and plans to eliminate racism 
and sexism from late-night TV by making sure minorities and women appear on the 
show. "There are a lot of people out there who don't have a talk show. I am 
their talk show." 
</P>
<P>
Hall will make two concessions to late-night TV tradition: (a) he will call his 
show "The Arsenio Hall Show," and (b) the announcer will be male. Paramount 
audience research showed that people did not find a female announcer's voice 
"authoritative" enough. 
</P>
<P>
And the title? It just seemed to fit. "We had guys here (at Paramount) who make 
$300,000 a year saying: 'How about "The Arsenio Hall Show?" ' " Hall said with 
a chuckle. "But 'Arsenio Hall After Dark' sounded sleazy. And I thought of 
'Arsenio,' " but they said: 'You're not Cher, pal." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Hall plans to shake up the format. Talking to his guests without 
the barrier of a desk, Hall said he will try for spontaneity with both guests 
and audience. "I just like to wing it," he said in a conversation at his 
ultra-modern Paramount office, with a big-screen music video throbbing in the 
background. "I'm a comedian, I come from the clubs. I know how to work an 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his youthful following, Hall will eschew leather jackets and jeans for 
stylish suits and a more sophisticated look to broaden his audience. Nor does 
he plan to limit his guest list to youth-appeal acts. "I'd love to talk to 
Ronald Reagan," he offered. "There isn't anyone who I would consider too old 
and square. I'd love to do Bette Davis, I'd love to talk to Wayne Newton." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Brown noted that publicists for some of Hollywood's less-than-hip 
stars have begun seeking out the show because they believe Hall can bring out 
"a lighter side to the client" than other hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as both host and producer will tell you, Arsenio will do nothing but 
concentrate on being Arsenio. "I honestly think Joan's (Rivers) failure was 
based on the fact that they tried to change Joan, they tried to tone her down," 
Hall said. "I have to be Arsenio. I'm the best Arsenio there is." 
</P>
<P>
"Sajak" head writer Monty Aidem believes that Sajak and Hall, both nice guys 
from the Midwest, have just the right non-abrasive quality and ability to draw 
out other people -- rather than simply go for a joke -- that makes viewers want 
to welcome them into their homes on a nightly basis. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the very successful talk-show hosts are Midwestern people, just like 
Pat," mused Aidem, veteran of "The Tonight Show," "Thicke of The Night," and 
Fox's "Late Show Starring Joan Rivers." "That includes Johnny Carson and David 
Letterman, and, gee, Dick Cavett, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people wear well, you don't get tired of them quickly. It's a real solid 
base to come from."

TRAIL OF AGELESS ART IS NOGUCHI LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, Times Art Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A biological theory known as hybrid vigor holds that a child born of parents of 
different races will possess greater intelligence and physical health than 
either of them. Metaphorically, at least, the productive and long-lived 
sculptor Isamu Noguchi with his Japanese-poet father and Caucasian-American 
mother seemed animated by this force. Born in Los Angeles in 1904 under the 
sign of Scorpio, he died last Friday in New York at 84. 
</P>
<P>
It came as something of a surprise to realize that when Noguchi's ledger was 
closed he had left a protean legacy of artworks scattered across three 
continents and had attained the status of the modern art world's leading 
sculptural patriarch. And not just because he had outlived the competition. The 
quality of his work had never faltered into commercial decoration or 
self-caricature as it has with so many long-lived modern masters. There was an 
incredible steadiness about Noguchi's work, as if it were produced by someone 
-- or something -- ageless, like a mountain stream patiently sculpting its 
rocks. Noguchi's career added up to a fairly vivid endorsement of 
miscegenation. 
</P>
<P>
Hiroshima mon amour. 
</P>
<P>
There is a socio-psychological theory which holds that people born of mixed 
race will be more troubled than their parents, suffering feelings of not quite 
belonging anywhere and never being exactly sure of who they are. Some evidence 
suggests that Noguchi sensed himself as this Marginal Man. Little of the 
autobiographical turns up in accounts of his career. He was married once, 
briefly. He moved about somewhat restlessly, widening his geographical circuit 
until in recent years he divided his time between homes in New York, Japan's 
Shikoko Island and junkets to other countries to work on an ever-expanding 
roster of commissions. He liked Pietrasanta, Italy, and recently caught a cold 
there, which eventually led to his death. 
</P>
<P>
If Noguchi felt displaced, he certainly identified with both poles of his 
alienation. During the Japanese-American internment of World War II, he 
voluntarily had himself confined to one of the camps. It was a wonderfully 
subtle affirmation of his roots and a truly aristocratic gesture of contempt 
toward the American establishment. After that he always looked a bit like a 
prisoner, keeping the top button of his shirt closed without wearing a tie. He 
looked at once like a convict, a Zen priest and a Eurasian polo fancier played 
by Toshiro Mifune. 
</P>
<P>
For many of the decades he was around one was barely aware of him. His image 
lacked the dramatic presence of the volcanic Picasso, the bear-like charm of 
David Smith or the trendiness and wit of Claes Oldenburg. Noguchi was like a 
shadow cast on the floor through the light from an open door, enigmatic and 
without substance. 
</P>
<P>
What was he up to? 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Minneapolis' Walker Art Center organized an exhibition whose travels 
brought it to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. For many adults it was 
the first opportunity to have a focused look at a possibly minor artist from, 
when was it exactly, the '20s or '40s or sometime and is he still alive? 
</P>
<P>
The show was an authentic revelation. Noguchi had studied with the great 
Brancusi but by the '40s, he was making works like "Avatar," whose forms 
resembled the biomorphic surrealism of Miro while retaining the sensuous 
material elegance of Brancusi. Noguchi seemed to be moving like a vacuum-fish, 
absorbing everything in his wake. In the early '60s, he made forms like 
unshelled snails before anyone heard of Funk. 
</P>
<P>
And so it went. Long before Robert Rauschenberg collaborated with Merce 
Cunningham, Noguchi did sets for Martha Graham's dances, for "Appalachian 
Spring" and "Frontier." They had the skeletal spareness of Giacometti's "The 
Palace at 3 A.M." Decades before art developed a social conscience or an 
awareness that real light and space were sculptural materials, Noguchi designed 
playgrounds. When artists furniture was not even a glimmer in the aesthetic 
eye, Noguchi made lamps. 
</P>
<P>
The years rolled on and Noguchi began to receive larger and more prominent 
commissions. They made it clear that his originality consisted less of pure 
invention and more of hybrid vigor. Squint at a sunken garden at Yale's 
Beinecke Library and it is clearly a minimalist paraphrase of Japanese Zen 
gardens with their raked sand and huge boulders. 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi's work tells us that the individualism and inventiveness of the 
Occident was anticipated in the collectivism and tradition of the Orient, where 
nature itself is regarded as a huge artwork. The artist does not dictate to 
nature. He listens to it and does its bidding. Just set the boulder on edge, 
give it a few taps and it is a sculpture. And we thought it was so 
revolutionary when Duchamp told us the art is found rather than made. 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi came to Los Angeles to work on his plaza for the Japanese American 
Cultural and Community Center and his spectacularly calm "California Scenario" 
in Costa Mesa's South Coast Plaza. He did not think highly of his hometown and 
was not a pleasant man to meet. He answered questions with contemptuous 
casualness and seemed to wish to be elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
He came across as a man so aware of his absolute aloneness that the only way to 
survive was to convince himself he had chosen it out of obligation to a greater 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
If one is going to fuse oneself with nature -- to take on the personality of 
the relentless wind or the tireless stream -- it requires a certain 
ruthlessness, an austere humility that can play out as arrogance. 
</P>
<P>
What does it mean that Noguchi made the monomaniacal gesture of establishing a 
museum to himself but then placed it in an obscure section of Long Island City, 
N.Y.? 
</P>
<P>
Noguchi set himself the superhuman task of fusing time and space into an art 
that makes Stonehenge modern and subsumes the idea of modernism to man's most 
primitive impulses, delivering him back -- truly civilized -- to the endless 
cycled rhythms of nature.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: POTOMAC 'POWER GAME' -- RULE NO. 1 IS . . . TAKE CARE OF NO.

What a thrill it is to visit Washington, stroll the Capitol, tour the great 
edifices of liberty, glory in the traditions of democracy and see the elected 
representatives of the people governing. 
</P>
<P>
Or whatever it is they do. 
</P>
<P>
"Before you save the world, you gotta save your seat," says California 
Congressman George Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, yes. Down from the clouds we plummet, crashing into the hard tundra of 
political reality. Miller's pragmatic words, spoken on the premiere of a PBS 
series titled "The Power Game," epitomize what appears to be the primary 
mission of many, if not most members of Congress. Not survival of the universe. 
Not survival of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Survival of self. 
</P>
<P>
Taking care of No. 1. That's the main theme of tonight's instructive hour about 
Congress (at 8 p.m. on Channels 28 and 15; 10 p.m. on Channel 24) opening this 
week's four-part series adapted from reporter/host Hedrick Smith's book about 
the inside workings of Washington. Tuesday's program tackles the Pentagon, 
Wednesday's, such unelected power brokers as the media and Thursday's, the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The drive to remain in office is primordial in politics. Yet Smith credits the 
Congressional Class of '74 -- a group of reformers who changed the rules of the 
power game -- with perfecting the techniques of survival to the extent that we 
now may have only a three-day Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Many members remain in Washington only Tuesday through Thursday, spending the 
other days back home, protecting their incumbencies by informally stumping and 
raising the funds they need for their TV-minded reelection campaigns. The 
survival obsession may be steadier in the House, which has two-year terms, than 
in the Senate, whose members are elected every six years. Yet the obsession is 
shared by both bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The average Senate campaign alone costs $3 million, we're told. Handshakings 
and mailings help. But the cornerstone of the "constant campaign," as Smith 
labels it, is media exposure. 
</P>
<P>
"American politics is money and 30-second spots," laments former Missouri Sen. 
Thomas Eagleton. "The modern young candidates -- the Dick Gephardts, the Al 
Gores -- can talk in 10 seconds, 20 and 30. You just tell 'em what you want, 
and they go click, click, click, click. Old-fashioned politicians like me take 
three weeks to answer something." 
</P>
<P>
Or as former House Speaker Tip O'Neill's one-time media adviser Chris Matthews 
puts it: "The old guys schmooze, the new guys broadcast." 
</P>
<P>
And broadcast and broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Smith sees New York Congressman (and Class of '74 member) Stephen J. Solarz as 
the prototypical media swifty and "master of all survival games." Regular 
viewers of network newscasts will attest to that. 
</P>
<P>
The Solarz mastery includes making an impression on the folks back home by 
shrewdly getting his mug on camera for positive reasons again and again. That 
includes this program, ironically, for even as his power game is being replayed 
and critically analyzed by Smith, the media-smart Solarz uses the camera to 
impressively convey action, movement and concern. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Congress with less access to national TV than Solarz is 
not left out either. Forget the old-fashioned mimeograph. Republicans and 
Democrats maintain their own impressive media operations that enable their 
congressional members to make and beam back video press releases to their 
constituencies via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Smith calls this "mass marketing with a home touch." The Democrats used the 
technique at their national convention in Atlanta, operating their own studio 
inside the convention center from which office holders and other prominent 
Democrats taped messages for their constituencies or conducted live satellite 
interviews with TV reporters in their home districts. With any luck, they made 
the local news. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite stage in Washington is the Capitol lawn, where tonight we see 
members of Congress in the role of propagandists for their voting philosophies 
and, not incidentally, themselves. One after another, these video hucksters 
queue up before a camera and make virtually identical statements tailored for 
local newscasts back home: "The trade bill is extremely important to this 
country and to my district. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"And," you wish they'd add, "my own survival is extremely important to me." 
</P>
<P>
So important, perhaps, that for many members of Congress the drive to save 
one's seat is so consuming that little time or energy remains for saving the 
world.

TV TALK SHOWS GOING . . . AND COMING . . . ;

<P>
THE IMPACT OF TABLOID TV ENDS GARY COLLINS' DAYTIME 'HOUR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"When you have had your fill of TV's tabloid talk shows -- Geraldo's satan 
worshipers, Oprah's weight loss, Phil's transvestites -- it is nice to know 
that you can escape to the common sense tranquillity of 'Hour Magazine' and its 
affable host Gary Collins." 
</P>
<P>
So began the letter from Collins' publicity agent Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
Although the show had recently "undergone a bit of a face lift," including a 
title change to "Gary Collins' Hour Magazine" to give it a more personal touch, 
the publicist added there was no change in the show's "core objective: to 
consistently inform and entertain without forcing kids to leave the room and 
without anyone shouting at you." 
</P>
<P>
Eight days later in a midseason surprise, comparisons would no longer matter. 
After 8 1/2 years, Group W Productions told Collins that "Hour" -- seen here on 
Fox's KTTV Channel 11 at noon -- was being taken off the air. The last show is 
Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
From a high of 154 stations across the nation in mid-1986, the program had 
dropped to 104 stations. "Stations were focusing on different program forms," 
Group W President Derk Zimmerman explained, "and, frankly, that's not 
compatible with Gary's style. . . . Gary Collins is a terrific guy, always has 
been, still is. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The clear implication was that Zimmerman was talking about program forms so 
successfully marketed by Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey and Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that until he got canceled, Collins and his show hardly got 
noticed. No one, after all, would ever toss a chair in the air on his "Hour" 
and break his nose. 
</P>
<P>
Collins apparently lost out by being too nice. To some viewers his 
"tranquillity" translated into dull. As TV Guide sniped last spring, "This is 
the TV talk show that poses the burning question: If host Gary Collins were any 
more low-key, would he still register a pulse?" 
</P>
<P>
It is, of course, precisely that kind of blandness that works so well for the 
50-year-old picture-book-handsome Collins as master of ceremonies on the "Miss 
America Pageant" and on the annual National March of Dimes telethon co-hosted 
with Mary Ann Mobley, his wife of 21 years, who was Miss America 1959. 
</P>
<P>
To Collins, who has no apologies for his "soft, service information" show, the 
real irony is that his last week on the air is all about tabloid TV, and that 
he was told of the show's demise while taping shows on that theme. Another 
change "Hour" producers had instituted to keep up with its competitors was 
having assorted "theme weeks." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there was any question in anyone's mind how the changes in the 
marketplace and the format out there had rendered a program like ours, which 
was extremely innovative in a sense when we started, kind of old news," Collins 
said slowly over a recent lunch at Trumps. 
</P>
<P>
He laughed as he recalled the coincidence of the tabloid theme. "It seems that 
the viewing public and producers of those programs have tapped into this 
insatiable desire for stronger formats, stronger issues, stronger 
confrontations, a stronger examination of subject matter and reality subject 
matter. And that was never 'Hour Magazine.' 
</P>
<P>
"So times change," Collins continued affably, "and you have to look way back in 
the woods to not see that the trend's coming." 
</P>
<P>
And what does he think of this trend? "I'm fascinated with some of the stuff. I 
cringe a little at some of the subject matter. . . . I won't give you any 
specifics, but I have a reaction as a human being that 'Gee, that was a little 
far. That was a little too close to the bone.' " 
</P>
<P>
Collins gave the impression of choosing each word with the same care he gives 
to his appearance. Not a color, pattern or sandy hair flecked with gray was out 
of place. He insisted that he is neither angered nor worried about the 
cancellation, but "excited" about the "opportunities." He had "some great 
meetings" with unnamed producers that very morning. Besides, he is the kind of 
guy who "always sees the glass as half-full and never half-empty." 
</P>
<P>
About the only note of wistfulness cropped up when Collins noted that "Hour's" 
ratings in November had gone up a full Nielsen point, meaning 900,000 more 
viewers. "So we really felt we were on the upswing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why he didn't do anything to accommodate the trend, Collins replied 
simply and without rancor: "Because our show was never that kind of (tabloid) 
show, nor am I that type of host. 
</P>
<P>
"Each host has had a very individual personality and that's what separates him 
from the rest of the crowd," Collins went on. Asked to define himself as a 
host, Collins said without hint of a boast that he was "inquisitive, sensitive, 
caring, likable, non-confrontational." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think all television has to be on that hard edge," Collins added. "The 
thing that's always separated what I do has been the confrontational element. 
You always knew when you watched our show, it wasn't there. That's basically 
not a part of my character." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed not. On a recent afternoon when the theme week was parents and children, 
Collins had as one of his guests a 20-year-old Nevada woman who was giving 
birth to her second child and was planning to have the baby adopted by another 
woman who was also on the show. There was not a tough question in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Collins' comments were optimistic and encouraging. Collins also 
brought on Valerie Harper and her adopted daughter. 
</P>
<P>
On this show, he introduced a personal note about his daughter Clancy, a 
20-year-old Stanford communications major about to take her junior year at the 
Sorbonne and Oxford. Every time he and his wife bring out the photo scrapbooks 
"within a couple of minutes Mary Ann's in tears, and I'm running to get 
Kleenex," he told viewers. 
</P>
<P>
With Collins, there is the decided sense that what you see is really who he is. 
He said he was spending the Christmas and New Year's holidays with Mary Ann's 
grandmother and family in Mississippi. "For so many years the family came out 
here for the holidays, but her grandmother is 96. Unfortunately, she's one of 
those seniors who has retained everything from the neck up but the body has 
failed. I'm not quite sure which is worse. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
The Collinses' next stop will be Africa to see friends they met while filming 
the 1974 TV series "Born Free," and other friends from their work in World 
Vision, the Christian relief agency. "Mary Ann went to Cambodia and I went to 
Ethiopia for them. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Although Collins, the son of an auto parts dealer, was born and raised in Los 
Angeles, he identifies himself as Midwestern and readily points out that "Hour" 
fared better in the middle of the country than in places like New York and Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Johnny Carson is probably my all-time favorite (TV host) in the sense I feel 
more close to that type. My family's from the Midwest, he's Midwest. My 
family's from Ft. Dodge, Iowa," he said with obvious pride. "I was the first 
one to be born outside Iowa." 
</P>
<P>
Collins graduated from Venice High School, attended Santa Monica City College 
and enlisted in the Army, where he discovered acting. His Army service included 
a stint as announcer and disc jockey for Armed Forces Radio. Already in Europe, 
he got a role in "Cleopatra" starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. 
After parts in several more movies made overseas, he went to New York and did 
some work in theater. In 1965 Collins landed his first starring TV series, "The 
Wackiest Ship in the Army." 
</P>
<P>
He welcomed the transition from acting to TV hosting. It gave him and Mary Ann 
a chance for "regular hours" and a more stable home life -- and his wife won 
the option of pursuing her own acting career. In the past, she had always 
followed him on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Over his show's long run, Collins had a spate of celebrity guests from Nancy 
Reagan to Fawn Hall, but he's most interested in talking about Laurence 
Olivier. 
</P>
<P>
"He came on and I said, 'I'm so impressed. Having made my living as an actor, I 
always looked to you and two or three others as the ultimate craftsman. I said 
I was 'in awe; I don't know what to call you, Sir Laurence or Sir Olivier and 
he said, 'Just call me Larry. . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
He said his show also was the first of its genre to put on regular AIDS updates 
discussing medical developments as well as discriminatory practices. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my good moments came from putting something on the air I knew I was 
going to have an impact. Medical things to me were the most important. I would 
get so jazzed when I would do one of those things. . . . One of the strengths 
of this show is to bring information to the public that at its least is 
life-enhancing and at its best life-altering. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Collins declined to rate the likes of Oprah, Phil and Geraldo. They each have a 
"different style" and he does not want to talk about that either. "I respect 
'em all for what they're doing. They're obviously doing a bang-up job." 
</P>
<P>
Only on that word bang-up did an edge of sarcasm creep into his voice.

New Year's Eve in San Diego County: 
</P>
<P>
One man was shot 3 hours before the old year ended; he died hours into the new 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A driver was jailed after his brother died in what police described as a crash 
fueled by alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
A quadriplegic was briefly kidnaped in a car by two armed men, and then dumped 
alongside a dark highway. 
</P>
<P>
And a teen-ager, apparently caught up in the noise-and-fireworks revelry of New 
Year's Eve, fired several shots into the air from a pistol. Then he 
accidentally fired a fatal shot at his head. 
</P>
<P>
"This New Year's Eve was a very busy night for us," Lt. Michael Blakely, a San 
Diego police spokesman, said Sunday afternoon as he sorted through a log of 
crime incident reports. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, without releasing any hard figures on the number of arrests, 
law enforcement agencies throughout the county said it appeared that the number 
of New Year's Eve drunk-driving cases had declined.

COUNTY'S 28TH MUNICIPALITY STARTS WITH A BANG, FACES THE CHORE OF UNITING 
DISPARATE ELEMENTS

<P>
Blessed by a harbor, beaches and world-class hotels, all that Dana Point needed 
was a sense of community to tie it all together. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, Dana Point lacked for nothing as it officially became the 
county's 28th city. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief ceremony aboard a replica of the brig Pilgrim (the first Pilgrim 
carried 19th-Century author and city namesake Richard Henry Dana Jr. to what he 
would later call "the only romantic spot in California") Dana Point's 
five-member City Council was sworn in Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the council's first official acts, Councilwoman Judy Curreri was 
voted temporary mayor by her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
A cannon blast -- actually, a 12-gauge shotgun blank -- marked the birth of the 
municipality as 100 people aboard the square-rigged Pilgrim winced at the roar. 
A fire engine-red Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol boat chugged up the 
Dana Point Harbor channel toward the ship moored at Dana Cove Park, its sirens 
wailing and five jets of water spraying high. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll be a great coastal city," said Ingrid McGuire, newly sworn in as 
the city's temporary mayor pro-tem. "I think it's a marvelous omen today that 
the sun is shining. Even the elements are smiling on Dana Point." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the city will get down to the giddy business of collecting millions of 
dollars in hotel bed-tax revenue and making sure that its 26,000 residents have 
enough essential services. A consultant has determined that the city's 
first-year revenue would be about $9 million -- $2 million more than needed to 
provide services at the level they are now under county auspices. 
</P>
<P>
The new council will have some nettlesome problems in governing a community so 
diverse that transient day laborers sleep in fields within view of $250-a-night 
hotel rooms. But nearly everyone in Dana Point is optimistic, given that it is 
entering cityhood as one of the more prosperous new municipalities in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as probably the greatest city in the United States," Lynn Dawson, a 
member of the Dana Point Task Force for Incorporation, said last week. "We've 
got harbors, hotels, beaches and sun nearly every day of the year. I mean, what 
else can you want?" 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, council members Bill Bamattre, Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause, Curreri 
and McGuire conducted their first act of business by adopting a 2-inch-thick 
set of county ordinances and regulations -- a routine procedure until the city 
adopts its own laws. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the Pilgrim II's deck with hands raised, the council members were 
sworn in by County Clerk Gary L. Granville. Newspaperman Dana sailed on the 
original brig Pilgrim in 1834-36 and published "Two Years Before the Mast," 
based on those experiences, in 1840. 
</P>
<P>
The council will select a mayor and mayor pro-tem Wednesday and participate in 
a ceremonial inauguration at the Dana Point Resort. Fifth District County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley is to administer the oath of office. The public is 
invited to the free event, at which hors d'oeuvres will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
The council will eventually have to adopt a general plan and hire a city staff. 
For now, the city has hired former Anaheim City Manager William O. Talley as 
its city manager and former Rep. Jerry M. Patterson (D-Garden Grove) as its 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The city hall now consists of a trailer at the construction site of an office 
building, where the city has leased space. The city plans to build a civic 
center within 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I'm nervous," Curreri said last week. "But I am excited and 
glad that we're finally at the point that we can take action." 
</P>
<P>
Getting there has been a long and troublesome journey for Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens who first tried to incorporate in 1961 couldn't even get enough 
signatures on their petitions to qualify for a hearing before the County Board 
of Supervisors, according to Dana Point historian Doris Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Twice more during the next decade, residents tried to incorporate but were 
turned down by the county for, among other things, not having a strong enough 
economic base, Walker said. During that period, Dana Point was little more than 
a sleepy backwater, halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But by the 1980s, the Dana Point Harbor had been built for yachts, the 
Ritz-Carlton and Dana Point Resort hotels had opened and the community was 
beginning to rival other county coastal cities for the lucrative tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1987, Dana Point decided to try again for cityhood. Curreri 
lead a group of residents to the County Local Agency Formation Commission with 
a plan to incorporate just a 3-square-mile area known as Old Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO later added 1.5-mile-square Capistrano Beach and -- in a move that 
outraged adjoining Laguna Niguel -- a 1.5-mile-square coastal strip that 
includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton and the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach 
resort. The two resorts are expected to account for nearly $10 million in hotel 
bed taxes -- a major reason Laguna Niguel laid claim to the same strip. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel's claim, however, has been rejected by both the county and by a 
Superior Court judge. Laguna Niguel is appealing further. 
</P>
<P>
With Dana Point's incorporation boundaries finally set, an election was held 
June 7 in which three-quarters of voters approved cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood outcome pleased nearly everyone in the community, as it finally 
freed residents from having to deal with county bureaucrats in faraway Santa 
Ana for such matters as street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason people wanted cityhood was to have accessibility to the 
decision-makers," Curreri said. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Cummings, director of the Orange County Marine Institute at Dana Cove 
Park, said the incorporation finally gives him the sense of identity that he 
had while growing up in a close-knit New England town. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel that we now have a city which controls a certain amount of its 
own destiny," said Cummings, who will be master of ceremonies for Wednesday's 
inauguration festivities. "The people running it will be people you see on the 
street every day and who are friends and neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
The self-governing process actually began before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic, Parking, Renewal 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point's City Council-elect met on several occasions in recent months to 
hear what residents want from their new city. They have cited traffic 
congestion, parking shortages and the need to upgrade older areas. 
</P>
<P>
It will take time for the city to organize, but Eggers and some other council 
members believe they can alleviate traffic congestion quickly. 
</P>
<P>
One major bottleneck, Eggers said, is at the intersection of Coast Highway and 
Del Obispo Street, where afternoon commute traffic often backs up more than a 
mile. Eggers said the city may press the California Department of 
Transportation to widen Coast Highway by restriping the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The city may also try to speed up the planned extension across San Juan Creek 
of Stonehill Drive, Eggers added, which would give motorists a second artery 
for getting to Old Dana Point from Capistrano Beach. That extension project is 
financed jointly by state and local agencies, so he said the city can help 
facilitate the work by making sure its share of the money is allocated swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, some merchants are concerned that a recent rerouting of Coast 
Highway traffic so one-way northbound and southbound lanes are separated by a 
large chunk of the city's main business district causes traffic to whiz by too 
fast for many potential customers to safely stop, Curreri said. She wants the 
city to install lights on both one-way corridors to slow traffic down. 
</P>
<P>
The city will also need to spend untold money repairing and maintaining roads 
in older parts of the city, City Manager Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first orders of business will be to study which roads need 
attention, Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers said the council will get involved in Dana Point's economic development. 
"You can't have a healthy city if you don't have a healthy business community," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers would like the city to establish an economic development committee to 
take a long-term look at the city's business needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourist Orientation Shunned 
</P>
<P>
One thing Dana Point wants to avoid, he said, is seeing its business district 
taken over by tourist-oriented "yogurt shops and novelty items," as he said has 
happened in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the city needs to bill itself as a "destination resort" that 
will not only have businesses catering to tourists but also to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Conway, a local Realtor and past president of the Dana Point Chamber of 
Commerce, said business is growing in the city. Membership in the local Chamber 
of Commerce, he said, grew from 400 in 1986 to 600 in 1988. Conway added that a 
2-year boom in local real estate has pushed property values to unprecedented 
levels. A three-bedroom home worth $150,000 in 1986 now fetches up to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the economic picture is not so bright for everybody in the new city. 
</P>
<P>
In Capistrano Beach, for example, transients are known to be camping under 
bridges and in fields, while Latino laborers congregate in large numbers along 
Doheny Park Road in search of temporary work. Capistrano Beach merchants have 
complained about the laborers, as well as about run-down housing along Doheny 
Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Contrasts in 3 Areas 
</P>
<P>
With pockets of poverty on one side of town and fabulous wealth on another -- 
homes in the Monarch Beach coastal strip on the north side of the city run into 
the millions of dollars -- the Dana Point council will face a challenge in 
meeting the needs of all residents. 
</P>
<P>
But the council may be ill-equipped to do that, as two of the council members 
live in the Monarch Beach strip and the other three live in Old Dana Point, 
said Peg Maynard, leader of a citizens' watchdog group calling itself the 
Coastal Organization Group. 
</P>
<P>
There is no one, she said, to watch out for the interests of Capistrano Beach, 
where 7,000 city residents live. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard, who along with many other members of the group ran unsuccessfully for 
the Dana Point council, said the city should have its council members elected 
by district to ensure fair representation. 
</P>
<P>
But Curreri argued that districting "tends to narrow people's focus and tends 
to encourage political deal-making. I would rather have five people concerned 
equally about the whole area."

BIRDERS TALLY TEALS, LOONS AND THE LIKE IN ANNUAL RITUAL

<P>
Loren Hays had been in bed for hours when most people were just starting to 
celebrate New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
His sleep was important. He got up in the darkness Sunday morning, made his way 
toward the coastal wetlands and waited for the sun to rise so he could look 
through a telescope and spot such species as the double-crested cormorant, 
northern shoveler, blue-winged teal, common loon and the long-billed dowitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Hays, a biologist at Cal State Long Beach and for the federal government, 
gathered with his wife, Debra, and five others, including Department of Fish 
and Game wildlife biologist Esther Burkett, for an annual bird count in a 
small, rain-soaked parking lot at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve near 
Pacific Coast Highway just south of Huntington Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas season count, conducted throughout the country by members of the 
Audubon Society, collects valuable data on bird numbers and habitats. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun made its first appearance of the day, about the time many New Year's 
Eve revelers went to bed, Hays' group fanned out over the state Department of 
Fish and Game's wetland reserve to count birds. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups met at other places along the coast to count birds and gather 
information about species. One group group went by boat to make its count 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to have bird shoots around Christmas," Hays said. "They would go out 
and blast everything in sight. In the late '40s or early '50s, someone decided 
that counting the birds might be a better alternative than shooting them." 
</P>
<P>
So each year, members of the Audubon Society and others, who like to call 
themselves birders, go out and count the birds. There are two counts each year, 
one inland and one along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"Much of the information that is gathered during the counts is now used as a 
scientific database," Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
The counters carry official tally sheets that list about 180 species of birds. 
</P>
<P>
The advanced birder in each counting group -- in this case Hays -- peers 
through a telescope scanning the wetlands for the birds. Hays called out their 
names as he found them. 
</P>
<P>
It went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
"Five northern harriers. Thirty-five long-billed dowitchers. Thirty-five common 
loon. One bufflehead and twelve northern pintail." 
</P>
<P>
As Hays rattled off the names, Debbie Hays thumbed through the pages to find 
the species and note the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"A red-breasted merganser. A pied-billed grebe. Two surf scoters and an 
American coot." 
</P>
<P>
Then the group moved to a new position. Hays began his search again. He looked 
around the estuary for birds. When he found them, he called out their species 
too. 
</P>
<P>
Hays did not need a book to identify the birds found Sunday. Asked how many 
species he could identify by sight, he modestly replied, "Less than a 
thousand." 
</P>
<P>
Last year was a particularly good one for the coastal counters. They spotted 
214 species, the second highest count in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we'll come close to that this year," Hays said. "Many of the 
mountain birds are not here this year." 
</P>
<P>
Counting birds is not an easy job, and prospective counters are warned ahead of 
time about the long hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember, every daylight hour counts," warned a newsletter for the Sea &amp; 
Sage Audubon Society, a local chapter. "One year, rough-winged swallows, 
northern water thrushes, lesser nighthawks and western screech owls were all 
found as the sun was setting or later. That means four species would have been 
missed if counters had quit early." 
</P>
<P>
"It is the world's greatest hobby, and I've tried about everything," Hays said 
of birding. "No day is ever the same. There's always a surprise. It's the 
thrill of seeing something new or rare, the number of species or the numbers in 
a particular species." 
</P>
<P>
Other birds spotted Sunday included some song sparrows, a black-billed plover, 
a Belding's Savannah sparrow, a great blue heron, ruddy ducks and a brown 
pelican. 
</P>
<P>
Also spotted waddling along the water was one large, white, domestic goose. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the goose, which looked out of place surrounded by the smaller wild 
birds, Hays noted that people who abandon domestic birds in wildlife reserves 
can be arrested by a game warden.

NOTEBOOK: LEVITY CUTS HEARING'S HOSTILE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
By and large, the court hearing that will resume Tuesday for David A. Brown, 
accused of murdering his wife, has been an intensely bitter and heated affair. 
</P>
<P>
The warring attorneys sniped at one another endlessly over the course of four 
days of testimony, beginning late last month. Vicious accusations flew wildly. 
Brown's 18-year-old daughter, who was convicted of murdering her stepfather but 
now claims she was set up by her own father, cowered on the witness stand under 
Brown's sharp gaze. 
</P>
<P>
And even the judge acknowledged that the hostile, emotionally charged 
atmosphere threatened to become more like "a three-ring circus" than a hall of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even in that tense atmosphere of antagonism, there emerged a few moments of 
levity so spontaneous that even the feuding lawyers, the man accused of murder 
and his embittered daughter all had to laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The week's proceedings in Westminster Municipal Court were filled with a stream 
of objections by both defense attorney Joel Baruch and prosecutor Jeoffrey 
Robinson as each complained bitterly about the other's legal tactics. And 
rarely did either miss a chance to tinge a legal objection with a personal jibe 
at opposing counsel. 
</P>
<P>
But on the second day of a hearing to determine whether Brown should stand 
trial for murder, defense attorney Baruch sought to strike a rare, conciliatory 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
As he began to make his point to the court, Baruch said: "Now I know Mr. 
Robinson is a very good lawyer, but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He was cut off abruptly as prosecutor Robinson rose from his seat with a wry 
smile on his face. "Objection!" Robinson said. "Assumes a fact not in 
evidence!" 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Baruch was trying, with some frustration, to shake Cinnamon 
Brown loose from the story that she had been telling on the witness stand for 
the last 3 days. 
</P>
<P>
Brown claims that she killed her stepmother only after her father's persuasive 
prodding and, wanting to protect her father, had remained silent about the plot 
for more than 3 years while in a California Youth Authority facility. 
</P>
<P>
Baruch didn't buy the explanation. He disclosed in court that Cinnamon Brown 
has a boyfriend, a young man whom she met in the CYA facility in Camarillo but 
who has since been freed. 
</P>
<P>
And through sharp questioning, Baruch tried to show that the young woman 
changed her story about the killing not out of any concern for the truth but 
because she wanted to get out of prison and be with her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't Cinnamon Brown jealous because the boyfriend is on the outside and able 
to date other women -- and perhaps leave her for someone else? Baruch asked 
pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, stone-faced and pained throughout most of her testimony, flashed a brief 
smile as she shook her head. 
</P>
<P>
No, she wasn't jealous, she answered quickly. "It doesn't really concern me 
because no one else wants him." 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom broke into laughter. Baruch, a bit flustered, soon moved on to 
another subject. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown was offering most of the admissions as she talked on the witness 
stand about the killing of her stepmother, but prosecutor Robinson had a 
confession or two of his own. 
</P>
<P>
On the second day of Cinnamon Brown's testimony, defense attorney Baruch was 
trying yet another tack in an effort to damage the credibility of the 
prosecution's star witness. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney wanted to throw doubt on Cinnamon Brown's mental stability 
by introducing evidence that the teen-ager had invented and often conversed 
with a pair of imaginary playmates -- Oscar and Maynard. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, objecting to the use of such testimony as irrelevant, told the court 
he didn't find anything strange about the woman's playmates. 
</P>
<P>
A bit embarrassed, he admitted that when he was younger "I had imaginary 
friends, and, frankly, right now I still have one." 
</P>
<P>
There were chuckles from the judge, the court audience and even Baruch -- 
though many in the courtroom didn't seem quite sure whether to take the 
prosecutor's remark seriously. 
</P>
<P>
And the judge? He agreed with the prosecutor's argument and blocked Baruch from 
bringing any imaginary friends into the case. 
</P>
<P>
The laughs will probably be fewer and further between when David A. Brown's 
preliminary hearing resumes. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Floyd H. Schenk has scheduled a hearing on Baruch's motion to have 
Robinson dismissed from prosecuting the case because of his conduct. The 
defense attorney -- who himself was cited by Schenk for contempt of court -- is 
complaining that the prosecutor has been trying to harass and intimidate him. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony then will resume, with Patricia Bailey -- the dead woman's sister, 
David Brown's alleged accomplice and now his wife -- takes the witness stand.

'89 ARRIVES WITH SANTA ANA KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A family argument left one man dead in Santa Ana, and a suspected drunk driver 
caused a fire truck crash in Anaheim on an otherwise quiet New Year's Eve in 
Orange County, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike past New Year's Eves, there were no reports of bystanders shot by 
stray gunfire in the county as revelers shot into the sky at midnight. 
Rain-slick roads prompted many to celebrate the arrival of 1989 at home, 
helping to keep weekend casualties down, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police on Sunday were seeking Tomas Bustos Valadez, 32, who they say 
shot and killed his brother, Joaquin, 28, during an argument. The brothers, who 
shared an apartment in the 1200 block of East McFadden Avenue, got into a brawl 
after returning from a party about 1:30 a.m., said Cpl. Charles Jarusek. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Died at the Scene 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Valadez took a rifle from his bedroom and returned to the living room, 
where he shot his brother, police said. Joaquin Valadez died at the scene from 
a single gunshot wound, Jarusek said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomas Valadez left the house on foot with the rifle, witnesses told police. He 
is described as a Latino, 5 feet, 9 inches tall, weighing 150 to 160 pounds, 
with short black hair and brown eyes. He was wearing a gray sweat shirt and 
green pants. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, four firefighters escaped with only minor injuries when a suspected 
drunk driver collided with a fire truck returning from a call shortly before 2 
a.m., police said. The driver of the car, Bruce Russell, 29, of Anaheim, was in 
satisfactory condition Sunday night at UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred when Russell turned in front of the truck at the 
intersection of East Broadway and South Wayside Place, police said. The fire 
truck was so badly damaged that it had to be towed from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Russell was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Dave Severson said the fire truck had been on its way to the station and 
didn't have its lights or siren on. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Quiet Holiday 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials throughout the rest of Orange County reported a quiet 
New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. A number of drunk driving arrests were made, 
but officials said there were no other major accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities in Santa Ana reported 27 drunk driving arrests between 6 p.m. 
Saturday and 3:30 a.m. Sunday. The California Highway Patrol recorded about 50 
arrests during a 48-hour period ending at 6 a.m. Sunday. The tally for New 
Year's Day was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
Several law enforcement agencies beefed up patrols over the holidays. The CHP 
added at least five officers to patrol freeways in Orange County to handle the 
rush of holiday revelers on slippery roads, a dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
In Costa Mesa, seven two-officer teams were sent out to look for drunk drivers 
and make arrests, officials said. Other cities with beefed-up patrols included 
Newport Beach, Garden Grove, Buena Park and Fountain Valley.

POSTSCRIPT: LOTTO WINNER STILL HAS HER GOALS -- PLUS A BMW, YACHT AND FIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE BUNDY SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When 20-year-old Christene E. Lentz of Capistrano Beach won $19.58 million in 
California's Lotto game in August, the first question fired at her at a news 
conference was: "So, you got a boyfriend?" 
</P>
<P>
Lentz laughed and answered: "I probably have a lot of boyfriends right now!" 
</P>
<P>
Today, she is engaged, drives a new car, owns a 43-foot yacht and has bought a 
new home for her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
And that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest change is that now I can spend money when I go shopping instead of 
just looking," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The day she struck it rich, Lentz said, she had been wondering how she would 
make the next $200 payment on her silver 1984 Nissan Sentra with $11 left in 
her checking account. 
</P>
<P>
"I had made three monthly payments before it happened," said Lentz, a 
Saddleback College sophomore majoring in theater arts. "The next payment I paid 
it off." Now, Lentz glides around in a white BMW 325i with a black convertible 
top. 
</P>
<P>
It was on Aug. 25 that Lentz and a Riverside truck driver split a $39-million 
Lotto jackpot. She will receive a $783,200 check every year for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always happy," Lentz said last week. "Now, I'm ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
Still living with her parents and working for her mother's company, National 
Aerospace Supply in Anaheim, Lentz has received six marriage proposals -- 
several in jest -- since hitting the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
But the one that counts came from her boyfriend, 19-year-old Charles Cooper of 
Colton, just before the Lotto numbers popped out that night in August. "If you 
win the lottery tonight, will you marry me?" Lentz recalls him asking. 
</P>
<P>
They were engaged Oct. 2 and plan to be married July 15. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper, a machinist who works for his father, has been dating Lentz off and on 
for about 2 1/2 years, she said. They began dating while both were high school 
students in Colton, where the Lentz family lived before moving to Capistrano 
Beach last June. 
</P>
<P>
"We had talked about marriage before," Lentz said. "But we didn't have the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Said her mother, Joyce: "I love him. He's every mother's dream. I always yelled 
at her when they broke up." 
</P>
<P>
During the 3 weeks after she won the Lotto, Lentz received a flood of inquiries 
from investors and a ton of missives seeking money. 
</P>
<P>
"You just kind of have to put them aside," Lentz said. "But I read a lot of sad 
things. Most people are too embarrassed to ask you for money to your face." 
</P>
<P>
"Except me," her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
Lentz said one of her biggest headaches has been handling paper work now that 
she has a lawyer, a financial adviser and an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"I also had to prepare a will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the BMW and the yacht -- which is still in Dallas at a former family 
getaway spot -- Lentz's major acquisitions include a Gucci purse and wallet 
(for $500) and lots of clothes. Her only exotic journey so far has been a trip 
with Cooper to visit his relatives and go sightseeing in Washington and 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"We were gone 4 days, and I missed home," Lentz said. 
</P>
<P>
She also has donated money for scholarships at Fontana Christian School, where 
she went to elementary school, and Colton High School. She set up a trust fund 
for her sister and has made a number of investments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lentz said money hasn't changed her basic goals. "I still want to be a 
theater arts teacher." 
</P>
<P>
She and Cooper plan to finish college and have decided they want four children. 
Lentz hopes to earn her teaching certificate, and Cooper wants to pursue an 
engineering degree. 
</P>
<P>
As for Lentz's family, they are trying to take the windfall in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect her to support me for the rest of my life," said her mother, 
who started her own company 3 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope not," Lentz said. 
</P>
<P>
Her sister, Collene, said she finds all the attention embarrassing. But she 
doesn't mind the money. "I still like shopping too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And what about the Lotto? Does lightning ever strike twice? 
</P>
<P>
Said Lentz: "I played last night."

JAZZ DICTIONARY FOR THE EVERYMAN DEBUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OWEN McNALLY, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weighing in at almost 10 pounds, "The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz" is the 
undisputed, world heavyweight champion of jazz scholarship, a highly readable, 
scrupulously researched two-volume, 1,400-page compendium packed with 
everything you always wanted to know about jazz but were afraid to ask. 
</P>
<P>
About as hefty is the price: $295. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't aimed the dictionary just at the jazz insider. And we don't presume 
that everybody knows what a 'honk' (a loud blaring note on the saxophone) is or 
what a gig (job) is, or even what a clarinet is. We've aimed at a very general 
audience interested in the music," chief editor and musicologist Barry Kernfeld 
said recently in a telephone interview from Oxford, England. 
</P>
<P>
Kernfeld initiated the mammoth project and has devoted the last 4 1/2 years to 
editing and organizing the work, which has been written by more than 250 
contributors from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a labor of love and absolutely all I've done for 4 1/2 years. I'm 
a saxophonist, but I haven't played a note all that time," said Kernfeld, who 
has been on the road promoting the magnum opus. The jazz scholar has been 
plugging the classy product in New York, San Francisco, Paris, London and even 
in a 5-minute appearance on NBC's "Today Show." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to open up the literature for everyone. And we wanted it to be 
wide-ranging, with a lot more than just biographical entries," Kernfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
"We especially wanted it to be even-handed in its treatment of all styles 
because so many people get bogged down in factionalism in jazz. Some people 
hate bop, and some hate everything but bop, and we've tried to avoid that kind 
of divisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
The Grove music dictionaries are to music what the Oxford English Dictionary is 
to language -- a scholarly source revered by many as the ultimate authority on 
matters of fact. 
</P>
<P>
Lavishly illustrated with 220 rare photographs from the celebrated Frank Driggs 
Collection, the handsomely bound volumes -- a bibliophile's delight -- surpass 
all earlier jazz dictionaries and encyclopedias in breadth and depth with its 
4,500 entries, 3,000 biographies, 1,800 discographies and more than 1,000 
cross-references. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its exhaustive Who's Who of jazz from Louis Armstrong to Joe Zawinul, 
the dictionary offers well-written entries on a dazzling variety of topics. 
</P>
<P>
Among these are musical styles ranging from ragtime to free jazz, jazz 
instruments from kazoo to synthesizer, record labels both flourishing and 
defunct, fabled jazz nightclubs around the world and festivals. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 100 magazine-length entries on specialized areas, including 
improvisation (the heart of the matter for jazz), arrangement, harmony, form 
and notation. All are illustrated with copious musical illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
"A small part of the dictionary is esoteric, but we also wanted to reach the 
serious fan who might want more in-depth knowledge of specialized subjects like 
harmony, or about specific things like how chordal substitution works in the 
bop style," Kernfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
If these more technical areas sound too dry, rest assured that there are plenty 
of juicy areas to tromp around in, including a fascinating 11-page essay on the 
role jazz has played in films. 
</P>
<P>
Besides being an invaluable resource book, the dictionary is fun to thumb 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Ardent fans will have a good time second-guessing the scholars and finding 
fault with their judgment about who gets in and who is excluded from this work, 
which is now the official jazz pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to take a critical stand here, but that's what Grove is all about," 
Kernfeld said when asked about the dictionary's process of natural selection. 
</P>
<P>
"A quarter of the book is devoted to non-American subjects, so I've had New 
Yorkers asking me why there are so many Europeans. The English are asking why 
aren't there more English, and the French are asking why there aren't more 
French." 
</P>
<P>
Errors, of course, are the ultimate nightmare for editors of any dictionary or 
encyclopedia, and jazz, as liberated as it is, provides no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most consistently misspelled name in jazz history has been 
Thelonious Monk's unusual first name. 
</P>
<P>
Grove has it right.

Former Channel 39 sports guy Al Janis asked what may have been the unwisest 
question of 1988. Frustrated with all the changes at the station, Janis went to 
his boss and demanded to know whether he was going to be kept around after the 
transition period. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, Al, now that you mention it . . . " was the reply, and Al went back to 
clean out his desk. 
</P>
<P>
The moral: Don't ask a question if you don't want to hear the answer. 
</P>
<P>
This is a strong argument for ignoring the urge to speculate about the year 
ahead. Perhaps we're better off taking the experiential approach, blissfully 
letting events sweep over us. 
</P>
<P>
But that would be no fun. As a great philosopher once said, speculation is the 
spice of life (or something like that). 
</P>
<P>
Certainly it is fair to speculate that KFMB-TV (Channel 8) viewers will be 
seeing more of anchorwoman Andrea Naversen in the next year. She has that 
professional, easy-to-look-at, Ice Queen-look, popularized locally by Bree 
Walker. The Ice Queen-look is apparently "in," so there is no doubt Naversen 
will be working her way up the Channel 8 ladder of success, especially since 
current No. 1 anchor Allison Ross' relationship with the station is rumored to 
resemble that of the Bundy family on "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
Over at Channel 39, viewers certainly will be seeing a lot more of former 
newspaperman Bill Ritter, who is becoming the station's designated hitter, the 
epitome of Channel 39's attempt to build a hard-news image. Now that Ritter has 
mastered the intricacies of television news -- his hair and makeup look great 
-- he is on the Channel 39 fast track. 
</P>
<P>
Also watch for more of Dave Bender at Channel 39. Bender reeks of perkiness. He 
is perky enough to be a poster child for a campaign to ban caffeine. Bender's 
perky weather reports and perky puff features are already starting to get more 
play, especially since semi-perky weatherman Brian Hackney recently said a 
short goodby. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of people born to smile 'til it hurts, 1989 will be a big year for 
Bill Griffith and the folks at Channel 10's "InSide San Diego." When Channel 10 
started the show, station officials said they were going to give it at least a 
year to build an audience. The year is up in June, and, following standard 
television operating practice, Channel 10 probably will either can the 
chat-fest, fire the hosts or make it a semi-permanent part of the station's 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The year ahead also will be crucial to Larry Himmel, who probably will get a 
chance to take his new Channel 39 show weekly, and for XTRA-AM (690), which is 
trying to establish its news-talk format amid a general "who cares" sentiment 
among radio listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the "who cares" department, KSWV-FM (102.9) will continue its attempt 
to convince people that modern elevator music is "The Wave" of the future. 
After an initial ratings flourish, listeners throughout the country have been 
opting to pass on "The Wave." The hiring of disc jockey Art Good, local radio's 
answer to Sleep-eze, is unlikely to revive the local version. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, all this is simply speculation, similar to these predictions for the 
New Year: 
</P>
<P>
* Channel 8 weatherman Larry Mendte will be asked to host "The Gong Show," but 
he'll turn it down to take a job in the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
* Channel 10 will rename its 5 p.m. broadcast "ZooNews," and reporter Margaret 
Radford will win an Emmy for a poignant and moving feature entitled "Your 
Friend the Giraffe." 
</P>
<P>
* Frustrated by lack of interest in his new television show, former mayor Roger 
Hedgecock will form a traveling nude mud-wrestling troupe, featuring himself as 
the ringmaster. 
</P>
<P>
* Channel 10's Kimberly Hunt, impressed with the hair dye-jobs of fellow 
broadcasters Jerry G. Bishop and Mitch Duncan -- and tired of being called a 
blonde bimbo by local radio personalities -- will decide to dye her hair 
purple. She also will legally change her name to "Babycakes." 
</P>
<P>
* Channel 39 sports guy Bobby Estill will quit to become the new sports 
columnist for GQ magazine. He'll be fired when he refuses to wear socks. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, you heard it here first.

Friday was the last day of local radio traffic reports from the Automobile Club 
of Southern California, the second traffic report service to fold since the 
national Metro Traffic service moved into San Diego a few months ago. "The 
service was no longer unique, so we decided to place the resources elsewhere," 
Auto Club assistant district director Bill Schurmer said. Metro will pick up 
several of the Auto Club's contracts, but local traffic reporter Jon Hoffman 
has landed the gig with KKLQ-FM (Q106) and KNSD-TV (Channel 39). . . . KSDO-AM 
(1130) afternoon talk-show host Stacy Taylor has been one of Kimberly Hunt's 
main tormentors. Friday afternoon, Hunt will be a guest on his show. Meanwhile, 
Michael Tuck will be a guest on Gloria Penner's KPBS-TV (Channel 15) talk show, 
6:30 p.m., Sunday. It will mark the start of Penner's fifth year. . . .

It must be nice to be editor of your own paper. Not only did the Tribune do a 
massive puff piece on editor Neil Morgan a couple of weeks ago, but last week 
Morgan managed to get a Page 1 photo credit for a photo of his own mountain 
cabin. And, in Friday's column, he sneaked in a plug for his wife's cover story 
in the January issue of Travel &amp; Leisure.

MUSICAL AND X-RATED SIDES OF A BLUE COIN

B.B. King posed the question of the night Saturday when he sang one of his 
signature songs: "How Blue Can You Get?" 
</P>
<P>
In the first of two New Year's Eve shows at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, 
King and Bobby "Blue" Bland both provided the traditional response in solid, 
sometimes eloquent sets, well stocked with classics of the genre. For them, how 
blue you can get depends on how much emotion you can generate in a song -- and 
the answer for both was plenty. 
</P>
<P>
For Millie Jackson, being blue has more to do with the profanely outrageous 
comic tradition of Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor than with the musical tradition 
of the other two stars on this triple bill. 
</P>
<P>
How blue can you get? Well, by the end of her 55 minutes on stage, there was no 
question about which Jackson is really Bad. Like Michael, who is no relation, 
Millie made a point of grabbing at her crotch during an X-rated, bump-and-grind 
version of "Something You Can Feel." Actually, she took it a step further, 
getting comic mileage by grabbing at male targets in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson wound up overdoing the saucy and scatological stuff. It would have been 
better to hear more of her gritty funk singing and ardor-filled soul balladry 
-- and less of her salty rapping about male shortcomings and female survival 
tactics. She might have hit a workable balance if she had played it straight 
with her last number, "Love Is a Dangerous Game," rather than turning it into 
yet another rude spoken rap. 
</P>
<P>
In these Sam Kinison days, dirty talk is cheap indeed, while singing voices 
like Jackson's are rare. She may have been breaking ground in the '70s with her 
raw comedy, but there is a greater need now for more moments such as her 
exciting improvisation at the end of "An Imitation of Love." 
</P>
<P>
If brashness is Jackson's hallmark, Bland's is restraint. It served him well in 
a 40-minute performance in which his singing was often stirring enough to 
elicit testifying cries from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
That old-fashioned response was probably prompted by some old-fashioned musical 
virtues. Bland had a crack, eight-piece backing band that moved deftly through 
rich, varied song arrangements. With full-bodied musical output such as that -- 
featuring real horns and a real Hammond organ -- one has to wonder why so many 
contemporary R&amp;B singers settle for emaciated and phony-sounding production 
founded upon tinkling synthesizers and sound-alike computer rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Using understatement rather than big vocal gestures, Bland's singing 
consistently brought emotions into clear focus. Whether pleading for romance on 
the soul-flavored ballad "Share Your Love With Me," or suffering existential 
slings and arrows on "Stormy Monday," Bland sang with conviction and immediacy, 
and his refusal to grandstand added another fine quality: intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
B.B. King made it a happy new year for anyone who loves to hear him play the 
guitar. In his previous county appearance, in August at Michael's Supper Club, 
King was content to be an entertainer, a talkative, gracious host rather than a 
musical dynamo. This time he came to make music. 
</P>
<P>
The 90-minute set was crammed with liberal guitar solos in King's distinctive, 
clean-but-rough-edged style. Highlights included "You Know I Love You," 
rendered as a lovely, lyrical guitar ballad, and "Why I Sing the Blues," which 
found King skittering up and down the fret board in a playfully rocking 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
King's singing was forceful, although he no longer has the impressive high 
range that he did 15 or 20 years ago. Perhaps he was limited by the sore throat 
that he said was bothering him. 
</P>
<P>
King stuck to older material rather than play anything from his new album, 
"King of the Blues: 1989," and that was just as well. In a crowd-pleasing 
ending, he sang "The Thrill Is Gone," the 1970 hit that brought him to the 
attention of the rock generation, then swung into a funky reading of "When Love 
Comes to Town," the new number from U2's "Rattle &amp; Hum" album that features 
King in a vibrant guest shot.

A fireboat captain I know (whose firehouse must be the only one that regularly 
posts art reviews) always kids me about my writing. "Why don't you ever say 
something positive?" he jokes. "Just say something nice once in awhile!" 
</P>
<P>
Believe it or not, I yearn to do exactly that. But much of the art shown in 
Orange County (and just about everywhere else; relax, ye civic boosters!) is 
mediocre. Too many exhibitions are ineptly conceived and lacking in 
intellectual substance, and the art too often tends to be timid, boring and 
parochial. 
</P>
<P>
These days, when we do get worthy art to look at, it is frequently packaged as 
an homage to a collector's good taste. Collectors have an important place in 
the art world, for obvious reasons. Art patrons have played a major role in the 
history of art. 
</P>
<P>
But art institutions have become too beholden to the consumer mentality of the 
'80s. We need to be looking at significant works of art not as fine possessions 
purchased by x but as significant entities in their own right. The best and 
most memorable exhibits tend to be organized around a strong intellectual 
concept: a curator's notion of how a particular artist developed his or her 
style or how a body of art relates to the preoccupations of the society in 
which it was created. 
</P>
<P>
In a larger sense, museums and other art institutions are doing their job when 
they give viewers "what's good for them" rather than what they seem to want. 
Art is a specialized field -- as specialized as computer technology or 
arbitrage or microbiology. Rather than second-guess the interests of "average 
viewers," art institutions are in a position to introduce them to art they 
don't already know and love -- provided that the institutions' overseeing 
boards of directors or city departments don't stubbornly stand in their way. 
</P>
<P>
By the same token, clarity and depth are the watchwords of first-class 
exhibition materials. Contemporary art is often based on difficult and unusual 
ideas. Older art is best understood in its historical context. Too often 
viewers of contemporary art are expected to wade through confusing texts 
bristling with unfamiliar terminology, and viewers of historical material are 
sent on their way with wishy-washy platitudes. 
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, however, this year's exhibition schedule includes a quartet of 
particularly meaty approaches to art. 
</P>
<P>
At Newport Harbor Art Museum, "L.A. Pop in the Sixties" (April 23 to July 9) 
will reconsider Pop Art in Los Angeles -- as exemplified by the work of Ed 
Ruscha, Joe Goode, Billy Al Bengston, Wallace Berman, Vija Celmins, John 
Baldessari and others -- in light of the movement's conceptual underpinnings. 
To quote the museum's press materials, the exhibit will deal with "the 
relationship between visual 'sign' and written word, the conceptual 
manipulation of common objects and an extreme autobiographical bias" on the 
part of the artists. 
</P>
<P>
"American Landscape Video: The Electronic Grove," coming in the fall to Newport 
Harbor (organized by Carnegie Institute Museum of Art at Carnegie Mellon 
University in Pittsburg) will survey 20 years of video installations by Dara 
Birnbaum, Frank Gillette, Doug Hall, Mary Lucier, Bill Viola and others (Oct. 
20 to Dec. 31). Besides experiencing the sheer visual impact of works by major 
American video artists, viewers may look for curatorial insights into the way 
an age-old theme in art -- landscape -- has been transformed into a 
psychologically acute and technologically complex form. 
</P>
<P>
At the Laguna Art Museum, "David Park" (March 9 to May 17) will present 75 
works from the 1950s by the San Francisco Bay Area painter who abandoned 
abstraction to strike out on his own as a forceful realist. Organized by 
curator Richard Armstrong at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the show has 
been criticized because it analyzes Park's achievement in purely formalist 
terms even though the artist was deeply and chiefly interested in portraying 
lonely people in everyday settings. It will be interesting to see how the work 
holds up under such heavy-duty, if seemingly misguided, scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's Fine Arts Gallery will offer a peek at the collecting habits of no 
less than Sigmund Freud, who fancied Egyptian bronzes, Greek and Roman terra 
cottas and various pieces of Asian art (Nov. 12 to Dec. 10). Unlike the usual 
run of "collector" shows, the collector is rightly paramount in this exhibit. 
What did art mean to the founder of psychoanalysis and why did he choose to 
live with particular works? That's what we will want to read about in the 
catalogue for the show, curated by Lynn Gamwell for the State University of New 
York at Binghamton. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, the exhibition roster also includes three exhibits consisting 
primarily of drawings by artists known for ambitious, large-scale projects. 
Granted, such shows tend to be on the dry side visually, but if presented well 
they can impart valuable information about the way artistic ideas develop and 
mature. 
</P>
<P>
"Barry Le Va: 1968-1988," at Newport Harbor, will present 80 drawings (and, 
happily, six re-created installations) by the California artist (Jan. 20 to 
April 2). Le Va is famed for his "scatter pieces," made with eccentric 
materials that included flour, felt, bullets and paper towels strewn around 
defined spaces according to a particular logic of their own. The show was 
organized by Carnegie Mellon University Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"David Ireland: A Decade Documented 1978-1988" at UC Irvine (March 28 to April 
29) will introduce a Northern California artist whose unusual architectural 
environments are seldom seen in these parts with a group of drawings for 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Works by Helen and Newton Harrison," at the Laguna Art Museum (Jan. 20 to 
March 12), will consist of drawings and hand-colored photographic works for 
some of the couple's ecological projects. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of other exhibits will explore pockets of art activity of more than 
passing interest. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Harbor's exhibit of work by avant-garde Moscow painter Erik Bulatov 
will offer a glimpse of the way glasnost has affected the formerly 
monolithically Socialist Realist output of Soviet art (July 28 to Oct. 1). The 
museum has organized the exhibit in concert with the Renaissance Society of 
Chicago and the Albert and Vera List Visual Arts Center at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Wayne Thiebaud: Works on Paper," due at UC Irvine (Oct. 8 to Nov. 4), is 
billed as the first major retrospective of prints, drawings, watercolors and 
paintings on paper by the Bay Area artist known best for his images of pies and 
cakes and hilly landscapes. Thiebaud is very popular with viewers. (The Newport 
Harbor show of the artist's paintings a couple of years ago was a smash hit.) 
But I hope that this show (organized by the Richard L. Nelson Gallery and the 
Fine Arts Collections at UC Davis) will provide a fresh outlook on his bright 
and seductive body of work. 
</P>
<P>
Another Bay Area artist is the focus of "Stephen De Staebler: The Figure," due 
at the Laguna Art Museum (June 2 to Sept. 10). The exhibit (curated by Lynn 
Gamwell for the museum and Saddleback College, where she was formerly director 
of the art gallery) will survey the sculptor's life-size works in clay and 
bronze. The monumental scale and fragmentary condition of these figures -- 
suggestive of archeological discoveries -- long ago gave De Staebler cult 
status in Northern California. In a larger context, his work always struck me 
as formulaic and redolent of little more than a sort of genteel, wistful 
humanism. 
</P>
<P>
But maybe this is the show that will change my mind. At the beginning of a new 
year, even curmudgeonly critics hold out bouquets of hope.
