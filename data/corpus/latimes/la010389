DANA POINT SETS SAIL ON AN INDEPENDENT TACK WITH CEREMONY MARKING CITYHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Blessed by a harbor, beaches and world-class hotels, all that Dana Point needed 
was a sense of community to tie it all together. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, Dana Point lacked for nothing as it officially became Orange 
County's 28th city. 
</P>
<P>
During a brief ceremony aboard a replica of the brig Pilgrim (the first Pilgrim 
carried 19th-Century author and city namesake Richard Henry Dana Jr. to what he 
would later call "the only romantic spot in California") Dana Point's 
five-member City Council was sworn in Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the council's first official acts, Councilwoman Judy Curreri was 
voted temporary mayor by her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
A cannon blast -- actually, a 12-gauge shotgun blank -- marked the birth of the 
municipality as 100 people aboard the square-rigged Pilgrim winced at the roar. 
A fire engine-red Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol boat chugged up the 
Dana Point Harbor channel toward the ship moored at Dana Cove Park, its sirens 
wailing and five jets of water spraying high. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it'll be a great coastal city," said Ingrid McGuire, newly sworn in as 
the city's temporary mayor pro-tem. "I think it's a marvelous omen today that 
the sun is shining. Even the elements are smiling on Dana Point." 
</P>
<P>
Now, the city will get down to the giddy business of collecting millions of 
dollars in hotel bed-tax revenue and making sure that its 26,000 residents have 
enough essential services. A consultant has determined that the city's 
first-year revenue would be about $9 million -- $2 million more than needed to 
provide services at the level they are now under county auspices. 
</P>
<P>
The new council will have some nettlesome problems in governing a community so 
diverse that transient day laborers sleep in fields within view of $250-a-night 
hotel rooms. But nearly everyone in Dana Point is optimistic, given that it is 
entering cityhood as one of the more prosperous new municipalities in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as probably the greatest city in the United States," Lynn Dawson, a 
member of the Dana Point Task Force for Incorporation, said last week. "We've 
got harbors, hotels, beaches and sun nearly every day of the year. I mean, what 
else can you want?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
County Ordinances Adopted 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, council members Bill Bamattre, Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause, Curreri 
and McGuire conducted their first act of business by adopting a 2-inch-thick 
set of county ordinances and regulations -- a routine procedure until the city 
adopts its own laws. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the Pilgrim II's deck with hands raised, the council members were 
sworn in by County Clerk Gary L. Granville. Newspaperman Dana sailed on the 
original brig Pilgrim in 1834-36 and published "Two Years Before the Mast," 
based on those experiences, in 1840. 
</P>
<P>
The council will select a mayor and mayor pro-tem Wednesday and participate in 
a ceremonial inauguration at the Dana Point Resort. Fifth District County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley is to administer the oath of office. The public is 
invited to the free event, at which hors d'oeuvres will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
The council will eventually have to adopt a general plan and hire a city staff. 
For now, the city has hired former Anaheim City Manager William O. Talley as 
its city manager and former Rep. Jerry M. Patterson (D-Garden Grove) as its 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The city hall now consists of a trailer at the construction site of an office 
building, where the city has leased space. The city plans to build a civic 
center within 3 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that I'm nervous," Curreri said last week. "But I am excited and 
glad that we're finally at the point that we can take action." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Troublesome Journey 
</P>
<P>
Getting there has been a long and troublesome journey for Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
Citizens who first tried to incorporate in 1961 couldn't even get enough 
signatures on their petitions to qualify for a hearing before the County Board 
of Supervisors, according to Dana Point historian Doris Walker. 
</P>
<P>
Twice more during the next decade, residents tried to incorporate but were 
turned down by the county for, among other things, not having a strong enough 
economic base, Walker said. During that period, Dana Point was little more than 
a sleepy backwater, halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But by the 1980s, the Dana Point Harbor had been built for yachts, the 
Ritz-Carlton and Dana Point Resort hotels had opened and the community was 
beginning to rival other county coastal cities for the lucrative tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
In the spring of 1987, Dana Point decided to try again for cityhood. Curreri 
lead a group of residents to the County Local Agency Formation Commission with 
a plan to incorporate just a 3-square-mile area known as Old Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
LAFCO later added 1.5-mile-square Capistrano Beach and -- in a move that 
outraged adjoining Laguna Niguel -- a 1.5-mile-square coastal strip that 
includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton and the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach 
resort. The two resorts are expected to account for nearly $10 million in hotel 
bed taxes -- a major reason Laguna Niguel laid claim to the same strip. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Niguel's claim, however, has been rejected by both the county and by a 
Superior Court judge. Laguna Niguel is appealing further. 
</P>
<P>
With Dana Point's incorporation boundaries finally set, an election was held 
June 7 in which three-quarters of voters approved cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
The cityhood outcome pleased nearly everyone in the community, as it finally 
freed residents from having to deal with county bureaucrats in faraway Santa 
Ana for such matters as street improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason people wanted cityhood was to have accessibility to the 
decision-makers," Curreri said. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Cummings, director of the Orange County Marine Institute at Dana Cove 
Park, said the incorporation finally gives him the sense of identity that he 
had while growing up in a close-knit New England town. 
</P>
<P>
"I really feel that we now have a city which controls a certain amount of its 
own destiny," said Cummings, who will be master of ceremonies for Wednesday's 
inauguration festivities. "The people running it will be people you see on the 
street every day and who are friends and neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
The self-governing process actually began before Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic, Parking, Renewal 
</P>
<P>
Dana Point's City Council-elect met on several occasions in recent months to 
hear what residents want from their new city. They have cited traffic 
congestion, parking shortages and the need to upgrade older areas. 
</P>
<P>
It will take time for the city to organize, but Eggers and some other council 
members believe they can alleviate traffic congestion quickly. 
</P>
<P>
One major bottleneck, Eggers said, is at the intersection of Coast Highway and 
Del Obispo Street, where afternoon commute traffic often backs up more than a 
mile. Eggers said the city may press the California Department of 
Transportation to widen Coast Highway by restriping the lanes. 
</P>
<P>
The city may also try to speed up the planned extension across San Juan Creek 
of Stonehill Drive, Eggers added, which would give motorists a second artery 
for getting to Old Dana Point from Capistrano Beach. That extension project is 
financed jointly by state and local agencies, so he said the city can help 
facilitate the work by making sure its share of the money is allocated swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Whizzes by Quickly 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, some merchants are concerned that a recent rerouting of Coast 
Highway traffic so one-way northbound and southbound lanes are separated by a 
large chunk of the city's main business district causes traffic to whiz by too 
fast for many potential customers to safely stop, Curreri said. She wants the 
city to install lights on both one-way corridors to slow traffic down. 
</P>
<P>
The city will also need to spend untold money repairing and maintaining roads 
in older parts of the city, City Manager Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
One of his first orders of business will be to study which roads need 
attention, Talley said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers said the council will get involved in Dana Point's economic development. 
"You can't have a healthy city if you don't have a healthy business community," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers would like the city to establish an economic development committee to 
take a long-term look at the city's business needs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tourist Orientation Shunned 
</P>
<P>
One thing Dana Point wants to avoid, he said, is seeing its business district 
taken over by tourist-oriented "yogurt shops and novelty items," as he said has 
happened in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, the city needs to bill itself as a "destination resort" that 
will not only have businesses catering to tourists but also to residents. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Conway, a local Realtor and past president of the Dana Point Chamber of 
Commerce, said business is growing in the city. Membership in the local Chamber 
of Commerce, he said, grew from 400 in 1986 to 600 in 1988. Conway added that a 
2-year boom in local real estate has pushed property values to unprecedented 
levels. A three-bedroom home worth $150,000 in 1986 now fetches up to $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
But the economic picture is not so bright for everybody in the new city. 
</P>
<P>
In Capistrano Beach, for example, transients are known to be camping under 
bridges and in fields, while Latino laborers congregate in large numbers along 
Doheny Park Road in search of temporary work. Capistrano Beach merchants have 
complained about the laborers, as well as about run-down housing along Doheny 
Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Contrasts in 3 Areas 
</P>
<P>
With pockets of poverty on one side of town and fabulous wealth on another -- 
homes in the Monarch Beach coastal strip on the north side of the city run into 
the millions of dollars -- the Dana Point council will face a challenge in 
meeting the needs of all residents. 
</P>
<P>
But the council may be ill-equipped to do that, as two of the council members 
live in the Monarch Beach strip and the other three live in Old Dana Point, 
said Peg Maynard, leader of a citizens' watchdog group calling itself the 
Coastal Organization Group. 
</P>
<P>
There is no one, she said, to watch out for the interests of Capistrano Beach, 
where 7,000 city residents live. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard, who along with many other members of the group ran unsuccessfully for 
the Dana Point council, said the city should have its council members elected 
by district to ensure fair representation. 
</P>
<P>
But Curreri argued that districting "tends to narrow people's focus and tends 
to encourage political deal-making. I would rather have five people concerned 
equally about the whole area."

BOXER'S DEATH STAGGERS FATHER WHO TAUGHT, NURTURED HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer

<P>
William (Murf) Murphy, owner of a popular downtown boxing gym, has been down on 
the canvas before. Looking back on a career that included more than 200 
professional fights during the 1940s and 1950s, he is the first to admit, "I 
was never a great fighter." 
</P>
<P>
But somehow, "Irish Billy" Murphy -- as he was known in his fighting days -- 
always managed to get back on his feet and clinch or backpedal to survive the 
round, if not the fight. Murphy has not fought in decades, but today finds 
himself reeling from a blow delivered harder than any he received from the 
dozens of forgotten opponents he faced in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, 62, would gladly relive the awful whipping he got from former 
middleweight champion Rocky Graziano more than 40 years ago, if someone could 
erase Oct. 23, 1988, from the annals of time. The old man's eyes filled with 
grief, and his voice choked as he told a visitor about that Sunday two months 
ago, when he carried the limp body of his 28-year-old son from the gym's 
dressing room to a rubdown table. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas (Spud) Murphy, a popular club fighter with the heart of a lion, 
collapsed from an aneurysm after a workout and lingered for 27 hours before his 
wife, Mary, gave doctors permission to pull the plug on the machine that was 
keeping him alive. Doctors told the family that Spud was brain-dead. 
</P>
<P>
Moments before collapsing into unconsciousness, the kid walked out of the 
dressing room, complaining of a headache and begged his father, "Dad, take it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
"Those were his last words. There was nothing I could do," said Murphy. The 
tone of his voice reflected his helplessness. 
</P>
<P>
Local boxing aficionados lament that Spud Murphy's ring career lasted less than 
two years. His professional lifetime record is listed as an unimpressive 7 
wins, 6 losses and 1 draw, but that does not reflect his fierce dedication to 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stripped of License 
</P>
<P>
Although he had not fought since 1979, when the state boxing commission 
stripped him of his license, the mention of his name stirs memories in the 
minds of fans who remember the quiet Irish kid who used to sell out the old 
Coliseum at 15th and E streets. Spud was a crowd pleaser, a fighter willing to 
wade in and trade punches with an opponent until one or the other quit or 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
His second fight with Sammy Meza was a typical brawl. After winning a decision 
over Meza on Oct. 21, 1977, the appreciative crowd showered the ring with more 
than $1,000 in coins, which was split between the two fighters. That bout was 
picked as the fight of the year by local sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Spud Murphy's fighting style was remembered by the San Diego Tribune, which 
reported a few days after his death that he lost his license because "he was 
the type of fighter who took so many punches while landing his own." People may 
have questioned his ring tactics, but nobody ever questioned his courage. 
</P>
<P>
Ringside physician Thomas Lundeen and Rob Lynch, director of the California 
Boxing Commission, said the aneurysm that killed young Murphy was not caused by 
any injuries he may have received in the ring. Lundeen reported to the 
commission that the aneurysm was caused by a congenital disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day I don't believe that Spud's gone," said Murf. "Whenever I hear the 
(gym) door slam shut, I listen to the footsteps coming up the stairs. I always 
look to see who it is, and I still expect to see Spud standing at the top of 
the stairs, smiling at me." 
</P>
<P>
The gym is at the corner of 11th Avenue and Broadway, on the second floor of a 
building that houses a rundown bar on the bottom floor and a nationally known 
billiards hall across the hallway from the gym. The approximately 2 dozen 
fighters and others who train there in the evenings have to run a gauntlet of 
pimps, hookers, junkies and hustlers on the sidewalk before walking up the two 
flights of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
A small, hand-lettered sign on the door lists Spud Murphy as the gym's 
"assistant trainer." But Murf has already made plans to tear it down. The old 
man has renamed the place the "Spud Murphy Boxing Gym." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spud Turned Pro in 1977 
</P>
<P>
Spud Murphy won his share of amateur titles in the early 1970s, fighting 
throughout the United States, before Murphy moved his family to San Diego, 
where Spud turned pro in 1977. Spud fought as a professional featherweight 
while he was still in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad, father-in-law and I would pay money to go see him fight. . . . He used 
to sell out the Coliseum when he was still in high school," said Rey (Cherokee) 
Inchaurregui. "Everybody looked up to the kid because he was so young and a 
pro." 
</P>
<P>
Inchaurregui, an ironworker who works out at the gym, turned out to be one of 
Spud Murphy's best friends. 
</P>
<P>
Murf nurtured Spud and guided his career, convinced that he was some day going 
to earn a title shot. In and out of the ring, the two were inseparable. Preston 
Easley, a local attorney and boxing fan, said the two shared a bond that went 
beyond that of a normal father-son relationship. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were looking for Spud, you'd ask where the old man was at that 
particular moment. One was an appendage of the other. The same was true if you 
were looking for Murf. You'd might as well look for Spud, and you'd find the 
old man," said 
</P>
<P>
Easley. 
</P>
<P>
Inchaurregui echoed Easley's comments. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at the old man, and you can tell he's hurting bad. Sometimes, when 
I'm working out I see him standing near the stairs, listening for the door to 
open. Just for a moment you can see him look quickly at the stairs, waiting for 
Spud to come running up. . . . If I had the power to do one miracle, believe 
me, I'd bring the kid back . . . for the old man's sake," said Inchaurregui. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Spud Murphy's life outside the ring was a complete 
contradiction of a boxer's life. The family is devoutly Catholic, and Murf 
remembers a church retreat that he and Spud participated in when they were 
living in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"We were buddies. We went on a five-day retreat with the church at a monastery 
located in the hills of Colorado. Spud served as an altar boy at Mass every 
morning. . . . He was a good kid. He went to church," said Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
After the state stripped him of his license, Spud Murphy appealed to the boxing 
commission three times, in 1983, 1985 and earlier this year, commission 
officials said. The appeals were denied each time. 
</P>
<P>
"We retired him in 1979 because he collapsed in his dressing room after his 
last fight with David Madrid. He was flat unconscious," said Lynch. "Once you 
start blacking out, we don't want you licensed." 
</P>
<P>
Friends say that Murf told them that Spud collapsed from exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Never Gave Up Hope 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setbacks, father and son never gave up hope that Spud would one day 
be able to climb back into the ring. Anticipating that, he trained and kept in 
shape, with Murf supervising every move. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked out every day, ran 5 or 6 miles in the morning at Fiesta Island. I 
used to pick him up at 4 a.m. and drive him out there so he could do roadwork. 
Then I'd bring him back and take him to work," said Murf. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my boy back," he continued. ". . . I'll be driving down the highway, 
and I find myself talking to him. I drive by the cemetery just to say 'hello.' 
I drive that Cadillac slowly by the cemetery and look at him. His grave sits on 
a hill. . . . Spud and I were inseparable," said Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
After Spud's death, the family agreed to donate his organs. The kid's heart is 
now ticking inside a father of five. 
</P>
<P>
When Spud died, he left a young widow and three young daughters, ages 8, 6 and 
1, and a 6-month-old son, Thomas Jr., or TJ. After his brother's death, Rocky 
Murphy, a noted amateur boxer in his own right, moved to San Diego from Denver 
to be Murf's assistant trainer. Rocky, 23, was named after Murf's old nemesis, 
Rocky Graziano. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Murphy, the matriarch of the family, manages the gym and is known as "Mom" 
in local boxing circles. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife was the strong one during the funeral. . . . She's the one that kept 
the family together. But, since we buried Spud, she hasn't visited the 
cemetery. She hasn't brought herself to accept the idea that he's dead," said 
Murf.

CASTAIC OPENS 2ND SCHOOL IN DISTRICT, MARKS CENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For nearly 100 years, one school was all Castaic ever needed. It was, after 
all, the kind of place where horses and cattle generally outnumbered children. 
</P>
<P>
But today, as the Castaic School District prepares to celebrate its centennial, 
the tiny district is opening its second campus, Live Oak Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here, there were 450 students in the entire district," said Sharon 
Millen, Live Oak principal and former principal of Castaic Elementary School. 
In the 4 years since her arrival, new housing developments have pushed district 
enrollment past 1,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
Live Oak has more than 500 students, many of them residents of a new housing 
tract surrounding the school near Hasley Canyon Road, west of the Golden State 
Freeway. The school can accommodate up to 600 students, and empty portions of 
the campus await more classrooms sure to be installed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 8 years, the unincorporated town of Castaic has grown from 2,500 
residents to 5,000. Its population is expected to hit 25,000 by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5th Smallest District 
</P>
<P>
But even with the new elementary school, Castaic remains the fifth smallest of 
82 school districts in Los Angeles County, according to the county Office of 
Education. The smallest is the Gorman School District, with 43 students. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, plumbers and electricians tinkered with sinks and clocks to prepare 
for the opening of the $6.8-million campus. New computers and chairs remained 
wrapped in plastic. Sawdust littered the floors. 
</P>
<P>
But Millen, a cheerful and energetic woman who likes to jog each week with her 
students -- "It's great therapy for the principal, and it's good exercise for 
the kids" -- was confident all would be ready when school bells herald the 
start of class today.

Millen said the centennial celebration will become a springboard for discussion 
of Castaic's history and world events since 1889. The children will participate 
in a country fair that will kick off the celebration in June. 
</P>
<P>
In its early days, the district consisted of a one-room schoolhouse, with white 
walls and green trim, that was heated by a large potbellied stove. The school 
was so small it was once moved on the back of a wagon. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Edmunson, a parent who is co-chairman of the centennial committee, 
said the discovery of gold in Castaic in 1876 and an oil strike a few years 
later fueled the town's growth, eventually leading to construction of its first 
school in March, 1889. 
</P>
<P>
The district was so tiny that until 1984 the principal doubled as 
superintendent. When Millen was hired 4 years ago, she technically became the 
district's first principal, a confusing fact for some youngsters. A few 
children, Millen said, asked if she hailed from the days of the potbellied 
stove. 
</P>
<P>
Until the recent suburban growth, Castaic had become known as a truck stop. 
That reputation developed after 1914, when grocer Sam Parsons started a general 
store to supply workers building the Ridge Route, said Jerry Reynolds, 
president of the Santa Clarita Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
Students of Castaic history will learn, Reynolds said, that it has always been 
a stopping place for travelers. Spanish friars built an outpost of the San 
Fernando Mission there in 1804. In 1847, Lt. Col. John C. Fremont camped at 
Castaic on his way to what is now North Hollywood to sign the Treaty of 
Cahuenga, which ceded Mexico's holdings north of the Rio Grande to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Two future Live Oak students had more immediate concerns last week. Clint 
Fredrickson, 10, and Barett Peterson, 8, watched from their bikes as a 
construction crew poured concrete on the playground. The new school, they 
agreed, looked beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
"I can hardly wait," Barett said.

SLAYING SUSPECT SHOT, CAPTURED 
</P>

<P>
A gunman suspected of shooting to death two innocent bystanders, wounding 
another and kidnapping a couple was shot by Los Angeles police Monday morning 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
A woman was also arrested in the incident, but a second man, believed to be an 
accomplice in the shootings, escaped, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The double slaying in the alley of a Sepulveda apartment building was 
apparently a random attack by two men who were angry over a New Year's Eve drug 
deal gone awry, said police Lt. William Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The identities of the two dead men were not released, pending notification of 
relatives. The wounded man, Timothy Brown, 24, was being treated at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, where officials refused to disclose his condition. 
</P>
<P>
Edward T. Furnance, 23, who was shot once in the leg by police, was arrested on 
suspicion of murder. He was being held in the jail ward at Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, where he was in stable condition, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Sophina Newsome, 27, of Van Nuys, who is believed to have been involved in the 
drug deal, was also arrested on suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said Furnance and his accomplice, armed with automatic rifles, had gone to 
a Sepulveda apartment complex late Sunday night "to seek retaliation" against a 
resident apparently involved in the drug transaction. 
</P>
<P>
"The dope deal had gone sour. There was a dispute and maybe a rip-off," said 
Hall, who described the deal as "a small-time narcotics transaction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grabbed Man and Woman 
</P>
<P>
On their way into the building, the two suspects grabbed a 22-year-old man and 
a 33-year woman who were talking outside. At gunpoint, the pair was ordered to 
accompany the men into the unit. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if they kidnapped them for cover or as hostages," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, who were wearing ski masks, kicked down an apartment door, but 
found the unit vacant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
As they left, the gunmen, without provocation, fired at four men who were in an 
alley behind the apartment complex at 8861 Langdon Ave. Two men were killed, 
one was wounded, and the fourth man escaped the bullets by scrambling beneath a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no motive in that shooting," Hall said, adding that the gunmen did 
not argue with the bystanders and may have shot "out of frustration." 
</P>
<P>
After firing at the group, the gunmen released the couple unharmed, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators determined early Monday morning that the gunmen had 
invaded the wrong apartment. The resident who was the gunmen's alleged target 
later told police that Furnance may have been involved in the drug deal with 
Newsome, who lived in a Van Nuys apartment about three miles away, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not release the identity of the man who apparently had been targeted 
for revenge. He was not arrested but was being questioned by detectives. 
</P>
<P>
Two officers hid inside Newsome's apartment at 15630 Vanowen Street for several 
hours Monday morning. Hall said Newsome is suspected of "setting up" the 
retaliatory shooting. 
</P>
<P>
About 9:45 a.m., Furnance entered the locked unit with a key. Police said he 
was carrying the same kind of semiautomatic rifle that was used in the double 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Furnace refused an order to drop the gun, police said, and was shot in the leg 
by an officer. 
</P>
<P>
Police, believing that the second suspect might also be in the building, 
ordered the evacuation of about 60 residents. The crowd stood for hours across 
the street, watching police and trained dogs search their apartments. 
</P>
<P>
A police radio dispatcher warned of a "man with an Uzi" inside the three-story 
brown stucco complex. Police fired tear gas into a Jeep during their search for 
the accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents said they did not know Newsome and did not know of the stakeout 
at their building until police issued the evacuation order. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew there was a problem apartment with drug-dealing going on, but that's 
about it until today," said resident Mike Payton, 20. Residents were allowed 
back into their apartments at 1:30 p.m.

REFLECTIONS: THE P-38 WAS THE HIGHEST SPOT OF MY WHOLE MILITARY CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PERRY C. RIDDLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas G. McGuire, retired Valley College English teacher and competitive 
marksman, fell in love nearly 50 years ago. The object of his affection was a 
sleek new airplane built in Burbank. McGuire, 70, writes for "Lightning 
Strikes," the P-38 National Assn. newsletter. He lives in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The first time I ever saw a P-38, some nut in San Francisco looped the Golden 
Gate Bridge. I thought, "Oh my God!" It was 1940. I just dreamed of that damned 
airplane all those years that I was flying other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
I graduated as a pilot in December of 1943. I went down to Santa Ana on the old 
daylight train, 220 young guys. When the war was over, I think about 69 of them 
were still alive, out of 220. I was lucky, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to fly P-38s, but I was sent to instructor school. I taught advanced 
flying for all of 1944 and a little bit of '45. I never lost one student. I 
like to think it was because I was very careful with them that I never lost 
one. 
</P>
<P>
I first went to Pecos, Tex. At Pecos, there was a cadet killed every week or 
so. We killed 13 in one night. We killed more men in training in the States 
than we lost overseas. A new pilot would ask, "How many pine boxes are going 
out of here a week?" Those statistics have never been made available to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
We killed eight in one day at Chico. We killed nine in one day in Santa Rosa. 
My mother would phone the Red Cross from San Francisco because the paper would 
just say, "Midair collision in Santa Rosa, both pilots killed." I didn't know 
how hard it was on her. 
</P>
<P>
I wanted to get out of the training command and into P-38s. Finally, I got my 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
The P-38 is a wonderful airplane, a twin-fuselage, single-seat fighter. The 
cockpit is between the two engines. It's got a lot of weight. It's got a lot of 
power. It had a nice, soft, sweet hum about it. It was the most incredible 
thing there was. The P-38 fought in every theater in World War II. It was the 
first American airplane of any type to fly over Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
No airplane ever had that many switches, lights and gadgets for one man to 
handle. It was harder to fly, more complicated. And it had the highest death 
rate in training and operation. 
</P>
<P>
In fighters, a solo flight is a very hairy thing, but especially in a P-38. I 
was really scared, too. You've got two engines pulling like hell. You have to 
lock your wheels, your legs jammed against the brake pedals, and you run it up 
to 3,000 r.p.m.s. I just let go of the brakes, poured the coal to it and got a 
shock from that slam back against the seat. I never felt that before. I had 
never been in anything that powerful. I came around and made a good landing, 
too. I got this funny feeling about that afterward, like, "Did I really do 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
I never went overseas. I flew P-38s out of Santa Rosa. Santa Rosa was a real 
fighting airport, with loaded guns in the planes, in defense of San Francisco. 
They were afraid the Jap submarines were going to come up and make a run over 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
When the war was over, I had the weird experience of ferrying beautiful 
brand-new P-38s from Lockheed to Kingman, Ariz., where they were just left to 
rot or to be chopped up. 
</P>
<P>
When I got out of the service, they offered to sell me a P-38 for $1,300. I 
didn't have the money then. I was going back to school, so I passed on that. 
Now one of those is worth $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
They made 10,000 of them, but only 13 are left. The P-38 Assn. is having this 
big blowup in January in Santa Maria. They'll have some P-38s flying, and you 
can walk up and look at them or climb up the ladder in back. 
</P>
<P>
The P-38 was the highest spot of my whole military career. It was the greatest 
thing that ever happened to me. No words can really tell what it was like to 
fly those things at maximum performance. It was a most amazing kind of thing. 
I've never used narcotics, but one of the guys who has, told me that going 450 
miles an hour at low altitude in a P-38 gives you a higher boost than any kind 
of drug.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: PERRY, EVANS LEAD SDSU WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego State women's basketball team, ranked 14th in the nation, 
returned from a 14-day layoff with an 81-58 nonconference victory over Murray 
State Monday night in Peterson Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Chana Perry and Julie Evans led the Aztecs with 20 points apiece. Perry was 12 
of 16 from the free-throw line and had 18 rebounds, Brooke Meadows had 13 
points and Crystal Lee had 6 assists for SDSU (9-0). 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Smith led Murray State (9-2) with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
With her team trailing U.S. International University, 74-73, and 40 seconds 
remaining, Wendy Sturgis scored to give Alaska Anchorage's women's basketball 
team a 75-74 victory at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Vanessa Johnson scored 30 points for the Gulls. Teammate Sonya Carter had 17 
points and her 15 rebounds are a season high for USIU. Alaska Anchorage 
improved to 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
USIU (10-11) meets Southwest Texas State on Thursday at 5 p.m. in Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego's women's basketball team avenged Friday's 31-point loss to 
Millikin of Illinois with a 67-60 nonconference victory at Triton Gym. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Koster's 15 points led the Tritons, Beth Koenig added 13 and Tracy Ragatz 
had 11, including two from 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
The Tritons used full-court pressure defense to shut down Millikin's outside 
shooting, which they weren't able to do in last week's consolation final loss 
(79-48) of the UCSD tournament. May Sanders led Millikin with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Millikin (8-6) led, 32-28, at halftime, but UCSD (7-4) took the lead with 10 
minutes to go in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
SURFING 
</P>
<P>
Brad Gerlach of Encinitas finished 17th in the $100,000 Billabong Pro on Banzai 
Pipeline, at the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The competition is the last stop on the 25-event series of the Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals. Gerlach's finish helped move him into 10th place overall on the 
ASP World Tour standings, his best finish since joining the pro tour in 1984. 
Last year he was 15th. 
</P>
<P>
Tricia Gill of Encinitas begins competing today in the women's event, the 
Sunset Beach Pro, also on North Shore. Gill is seeded eighth in the 
competition.

SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego stocks on average turned in a much better year than the major stock 
averages, according to Irving Katz, director of research at Thomas Green/San 
Diego Securities. 
</P>
<P>
"On a composite basis, our list of 69 stocks gained 19.3%, compared to the 
11.8% increase in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 12.4% in the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 average and 15.4% in the NASDAQ Composite," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for the gain is probably the preponderance of small-capitalization 
San Diego companies in our list, which were overly depressed in the last few 
months of 1987 following the October, 1987, (stock market) debacle. That made 
for significant gains in 1988," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Big local gainers were led by Pancretec, which gained 701%. It moved from 
$1.06, its closing bid in 1987, to $8.50 in 1988. Medical Imaging Centers 
gained 147%. Both companies began to show profits for the first time during 
1988 and were initial ventures investments by John Pappajohn, an Iowa-based 
venture capitalist instrumental in many San Diego start-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Following in percentage gains were Cousins Home Furnishings, up 133%; Advanced 
Marketing Services, up 123%; Agouron Pharmaceuticals, up 103%; and Psicor, up 
84%. Medi-Mail, which went public at $1 last year, closed 1988 at $1.81 for an 
81% gain. 
</P>
<P>
On the downside, some local companies nearly disappeared in price. The biggest 
loser was International Robomation, which went from $2.625 to $.125, a 95% 
loss. Gascard Club dropped from $1.75 to $.125 for a 93% loss. These were 
followed by Telequest, down 77%; Celltronics, down 74%; CHoPP Computer, down 
71%; Kaypro, down 67%; and CCT Corp., down 62%. 
</P>
<P>
During the year, eight San Diego stocks disappeared through mergers and 
acquisitions. Foodmaker, which closed 1987 at $9.25 a share, went private at 
$19.43. Energy Factors, which closed 1987 at $5.375, was purchased by Sithe 
Energy for $8.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Video Library, closing 1987 at $3.125, was purchased for cash by Blockbuster 
Entertainment for $4.75 a share. Linear Corp. and Northview Corp. completed 
mergers begun the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham American Properties was merged into Burnham Pacific Properties. Magma 
Energy was merged into Magma Power, and Guild Mortgage Investments shares were 
exchanged for those of MDC Asset Investors.

THE GREAT YEAR-END TAX RACE; 
</P>
<P>
NUMBERS CRUNCHING IS THE NAME OF THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Chatsworth drug manufacturer intentionally slowed its sales to get a bigger 
tax refund. In Simi Valley, a maker of computer parts hired temporary 
accountants to put its books in order. And a stockbroker urged a Woodland Hills 
investor to quickly sell some ailing stocks in his portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
These are just a few examples of how San Fernando Valley area businesses and 
individuals last week took last-minute steps to bolster their 1988 financial 
performance as the year drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the maneuvers were aimed at reducing Uncle Sam's tax bite. 
Companies and individuals try to maintain financial and tax strategies 
throughout the year, but the calendar often prompts them to fuss with their 
financial affairs one last time in an effort to squeeze out extra savings. 
</P>
<P>
That's especially true for investors -- both institutional and individual -- 
who own securities that have not done well. Tax laws enable investors who sell 
securities at a loss to use those losses to cut their tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
Losses on securities sales can offset capital gains up to $3,000 of an 
investor's ordinary income in any one year, said Richard T. Walsh, vice 
president for investments at the Woodland Hills branch of the brokerage firm 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Selling Hard to Do 
</P>
<P>
So as the end of the year approached, investors asked: Do I sell now so I can 
use the losses in 1988, or keep the securities and hope that they will do 
better in '89? 
</P>
<P>
"Selling is the hardest thing an investor does. Dec. 31 forces us to make a 
decision," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies were busy tidying up financially in advance of 1989. The maker 
of computer parts in Simi Valley and a movie company in Burbank were among 
those getting accounting help from Accountants Overload, a Westwood-based firm 
that provides 50,000 temporary accountants annually in Southern California. 
Lynn Kaplan, who manages Accountants Overload's Woodland Hills branch, declined 
to identify the companies. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, her temporary accountants help get the customers' books and 
records in order so the customers can have their annual audits performed early 
in the new year by outside auditors. The Big 8 accounting firms, which perform 
such audits, also hire temporary accountants to help with the year-end number 
crunching, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The big accounting firms, meanwhile, were busy dispensing last-minute tax 
advice to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Bill Michaels, a tax partner at Coopers &amp; Lybrand's Sherman 
Oaks office, said one of his clients, the Chatsworth drug producer that he also 
declined to identify, intentionally "slowed down on year-end sales" to cut its 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losses Mean Tax Refund 
</P>
<P>
How? If a company loses money from operations during the year, it can use the 
losses to get back income taxes that it paid in the 3 previous years, Michaels 
said. Thus, the Chatsworth company, realizing that it would have a loss for 
1988 in any case, slowed it sales "to maximize the size" of the tax refund that 
it stands to get. Why? Had the company continued pushing for sales as the year 
ended, he said, its operating loss might have narrowed or vanished, as would 
its tax refund. 
</P>
<P>
Michaels said another client, a majority owner of an insurance agency in 
Sherman Oaks, had to decide by last week how much he should pay himself in a 
year-end bonus to cut his firm's 1988 tax liability. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the 1986 overhaul of the federal tax system, closely held firms 
generally can get a deduction and reduce their taxes by paying much of their 
profit to owners who control more than 50% of the business. The money is also 
shifted from the corporate level, where the top federal income tax rate is 34%, 
to the individual level, where the top rate is generally 28%, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
But individuals also grappled with how best to position their tax liability for 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Several self-employed people came into TransWorld Bank late last week to open 
Keough accounts, which are tax-deferred retirement plans for the self-employed. 
The plans can be fully funded later this year when the people file their tax 
returns, but the law required that the plans be established in 1988 to use the 
plan's deduction for that year, said Peter Steinmann, TransWorld's senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losing Stocks Stold 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, the Bateman Eichler executive, said one of his customers is a 
well-heeled Woodland Hills man who will retire this year. In looking at his 
investment portfolio, Walsh noted four stocks that were losers. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh urged the man to sell the stocks because he could use the losses to 
reduce his taxes. But he said the main reason that he urged the investor to 
sell last year is because the man's six-figure income will drop when he 
retires. 
</P>
<P>
By taking the losses in 1988 instead of this year, the man "gets the maximum 
use of his tax losses" while he is in a higher tax bracket, Walsh said.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: BRITISH COMPANY TO PAY $15 MILLION FOR ANDUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Courtaulds, a British chemical, textile and industrial products company, has 
agreed to buy Andus Corp. in Canoga Park from its parent company, Raychem Corp. 
of Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
Courtaulds will pay $15 million. As much as $10 million more may be paid to 
Raychem should Andus' revenue growth meet certain targets. 
</P>
<P>

A DARK LOOK AT LIFE ON THE HOME FRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT ELLIS TAYLOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Breaking and Entering by Joy Williams (Vintage Contemporaries /Random House: 
$6.95; 251 pages) 
</P>
<P>
 With her two earlier novels -- "State of Grace" (1973) and "The Changling" 
(1978) -- Joy Williams has come to be known as a writer talented in creating 
surreal, dreamlike worlds corresponding to the mental states of 
child-preoccupied women. The first one was a pregnant woman named Kate in shock 
from the accidental death of her husband; the second, Pearl, was subject to 
alcoholic and paedophobic hallucinations. 
</P>
<P>
And now with the publication of "Breaking and Entering," a third has been added 
to the Williams collection of mothers-gone-mad. This is Liberty, a young woman 
first introduced in a short story called "Breakfast," part of a volume of 
stories, "Taking Care," published in 1982. She is a pretty, though gloomy, 
young woman unable to speak for herself, married to Willie who talks for her, 
making up stories about his wife for the amusement of whoever will listen. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Secret Lives 
</P>
<P>
But with the expansion of story to novel, the plot has thickened, so that 
Liberty's inability to talk, we learn, stems from much more than simple 
reticence. She is a woman of secret lives created by Willie's honed skills of 
breaking into other people's houses and living there for short periods of time, 
a habit acquired after they are banished from the house of their parents at the 
early age of 15 because of Liberty's pregnancy and their failed attempt at a 
joint suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Liberty's subsequent stay in a psych ward and her life upon release with Willie 
leave her somewhat unsure of her status as real person. She tends to believe 
that they are living beyond their own deaths, as she finds herself walking 
through locked doors and occupying others' spaces. And Willie seems to have 
taken up the occupation of saint, occasionally saving people from death by 
physical intercession. 
</P>
<P>
Sick green ocean tides come and go, carrying Liberty and Willie off to affluent 
beach houses, then back to their own dilapidated rent-house in a working-class 
neighborhood. The children from both sides of town are in states of desertion 
because of disrupted households and low priorities given to parenthood. Liberty 
baby-sits the 7-year-old bed-wetting Teddy who is wired to an alarm and a 
rubber sheet at night and kept busy by his father's unfaithful girlfriend, 
Janiella, during the day with an unending schedule of extracurricular 
activities in order to keep him out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Dread, Despair and Sorrow stalk through the sumptuously appointed villas as 
well as the low-income houses like apocalyptic specters, and the public schools 
have become battlefields in a time of dark revelation as Liberty finds written 
between the lines of a mimeo sheet about drugs from Teddy's school: "The 
principal had misspelled absorption. The school had faulty wiring, daily 
tornado drills, and nervous German shepherds with names like Kong and Goforit 
prowling the corridors seeking illegal substances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awkward Metaphors 
</P>
<P>
They had banned "The Little Lame Prince" from the library, had a nurse who 
spanked children in the infirmary, and had turned off the drinking fountains 
because there was salt-water infusion in the wells. A teacher had just been 
attacked in a room where children were dutifully growing radishes in egg 
cartons and making cameras out of Quaker Oats boxes. There wasn't time for 
spelling." 
</P>
<P>
Williams' preoccupation with the enigmas of time clogs her own generally smooth 
running prose in places, creating awkward metaphors that even a wraith like 
Liberty would be hard put to perform, as when "the moments of the past are 
stones behind her, over which she stumbles forward." And, just as Liberty is 
accused at one point of making an object of her life, so Williams is more 
interested at times in making symbols of her characters than developing the 
subtle contrarinesses that make fictional beings come alive. 
</P>
<P>
But by and large, Williams' quick juxtapositions of telling detail draw the 
reader into the story's otherwise murky undertow. And Teddy becomes one of the 
more engaging children of modern fiction whose devotion to the egg he is 
assigned to carry with him in his human sexuality class for a week, though a 
futile effort in terms of actually making it hatch into something, makes him 
the real hero in an otherwise motherless world. 
</P>
<P>
The rivers of death and self-destruction are difficult to explore. But great 
poets and prophets have not refused the challenge of the plunge, and our 
literature is richer for it. Dante brought his note pad with him on his barge 
ride down the river; Lethe and Jeremiah walked the streets of the City of Death 
at daylight predicting its fall. And so Williams, in the good company of these 
literary predecessors, continues with maturity and growing power to voice a 
dark vision -- the reflection of life on the home front gone loveless and sour, 
reminding us that the hour of Now is upon ourselves and our children, and all 
is not well.

Ray Cooney's "Run for Your Wife," the longest-running comedy on the London 
stage, is Broadway-bound after six years on the West End. The play starts 
previews at New York's Virginia Theater on Feb. 22, opening March 7, after a 
tryout stint Jan. 17 to Feb. 19 at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami. "It's 
so readily acceptable; that's what people relate to," Cooney, 56, said of his 
farce about a bigamous taxi driver. "It can be summed up so simply. People can 
understand the dilemma of an innocent guy who, because he didn't have the heart 
to say no, has got two wives." "Run for Your Wife" has been slated for Broadway 
for years, but Cooney said only now had talent and script meshed properly. 
Under a special agreement with the American actors' union, Equity, three 
British actors will appear in the play for four months on Broadway, at which 
point the five Americans completing the New York lineup will transfer to the 
London production at the Criterion Theatre. DAVID CROOK

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: CLASSICAL MUSIC / KENNETH HERMAN: STARTING THE YEAR OFF ON 
A PREDICTABLE NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH HERMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
In these opening days of the new year, it is tempting to take a look into the 
critic's crystal ball and divine the highlights of the local music scene in 
1989. If this column appeared in a supermarket tabloid, the list of predictions 
might begin with San Diego Symphony executive director Wesley Brustad sighting 
a UFO atop the new Symphony Towers. But tabloids and classical music? Never! 
</P>
<P>
This is the year in which the San Diego Symphony is scheduled to announce the 
name of its new music director. Since the post has been vacant for nearly two 
years, a new music director, especially one in place for the 1989-90 season, 
could be the city's best musical news of the year. Without the steady, 
cultivating influence of a music director, the local orchestra has little 
chance of becoming a first-class symphonic organization. 
</P>
<P>
Sources within the symphony claim that Leopold Hager, the guest conductor who 
opened the symphony season this October, is Brustad's personal favorite. Kees 
Bakels, who conducted the orchestra last month, won the hearts of many players, 
and Jahja Ling made an impressive case for his podium abilities when he 
conducted Beethoven's Fourth Symphony a few weeks later. However, Ling's 
enthusiasm for American composers and contemporary music is not likely to win 
him any points with the symphony board or administration. 
</P>
<P>
I predict that Hager will be named the symphony's new music director. 
</P>
<P>
David Atherton's Mainly Mozart festival, scheduled to be held at the Old Globe 
Theatre in June, is not likely to be a significant addition to the local scene. 
Atherton's return to music making in this city will no doubt quicken the pulse 
of many a La Jolla matron. But the La Jolla Chamber Music Society's SummerFest 
already has set the standard for a summer festival based around standard 
repertory, and, in the past, musical events held at the Old Globe have not 
fared well. 
</P>
<P>
I predict that Mainly Mozart will be more of a social success than a musical 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Opera's offerings for the 1989 season are not going to set opera in 
America on its ear, nor will they lure the cadre of international critics to 
Civic Theatre. While the production of Beethoven's "Fidelio" set in a 
contemporary Banana Republic sounds intriguing, the rest of the season -- 
another "Madama Butterfly" and two Donizetti warhorses -- is about as ho-hum as 
it could be. 
</P>
<P>
I predict an increase of No-Doze sales at Civic Theatre during the opera 
season. 
</P>
<P>
If the mayor's vaunted Soviet Arts Festival makes a serious contribution to the 
classical music scene, it will come as a welcome surprise. San Diego Opera is 
supposed to open the festival in October with a "Boris Godunov" production, 
still not cast, and other musical plans are even hazier. 
</P>
<P>
I predict a "Boris Godunov" less impressive than the 1971 production by the 
still fledgling San Diego Opera. Although it was not the most sumptuous staging 
of Mussorgsky's grand historical opera, it did boast no less a singer than the 
late Norman Treigle in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego put itself on the map musically by championing contemporary music 
and composers. Last summer, SONOR and a large entourage of UCSD musicians, 
composers and technicians were guests of the noted Institute for Contemporary 
Music at Darmstadt, West Germany. Since the return of the SONOR traveling show, 
the department movers and shakers have been recuperating from their exhausting 
international exposure. 
</P>
<P>
I predict that for UCSD's SONOR, 1989 will be the first year of a 20-year 
snooze, a la Rip Van Winkle, in which the contemporary performance ensemble 
will sleep on its laurels. 
</P>
<P>
Local classical radio station KFSD-FM will resume broadcasting the weekly radio 
program hosted by San Diego Opera's Ian Campbell this Saturday at 6 p.m. The 
15-week series will present a potpourri of opera news, interviews and music, 
focusing on the operas and singers featured in the local company's 1989 season. 
Among the show's more winning traits are Campbell's rare recordings of obscure 
operas and fabled divas of earlier eras, not to mention the general director's 
own tongue-in-cheek evaluations of singers and recapitulation of opera lore. 
The final program, on April 16, will present San Diego Opera's new season for 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
If the term "petting zoo" sounds slightly off color, banish such impure 
thoughts. The San Diego Symphony sets up a petting zoo in the Symphony Hall 
lobby at its family concerts and Classical Hits programs. Patterned after a 
children's zoo, it gives youngsters a chance to get some hands-on experience 
with various musical instruments. Under the supervision and assistance of the 
petting zoo staff, children can toot a cornet, blow notes on an oboe or bow a 
cello. For many youngsters, this is the first time they have actually handled 
instruments they've seen in a marching band or watched on the symphony stage. 
</P>
<P>
Should any readers have unused musical instruments they would like to donate to 
the petting zoo, Marilyn Rue, the orchestra's education coordinator, would be 
glad to hear from them. Rue can be reached at the symphony office in Symphony 
Hall.

RITE OF PASSAGE FOR A ROOKIE COP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Terror on Highway 91" (Channels 2 and 8 at 9 tonight) is an assembly-line 
presentation of a young cop's exposure of corruption and brutality within the 
sheriff's department of a small Southern county. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many surprises here. At the beginning of the film, a flashback 
framing device informs us that there's trouble, right here in Cade County, and 
the examples of that trouble parade across the screen for most of the running 
time of the film. It's difficult for us to share the gradual disillusionment of 
rookie cop Clay Nelson (Ricky Schroder) when we're never allowed to share the 
initial illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Writer Stuart Schoffman also neglects to explain why Clay, who joins the 
sheriff's department right out of high school, is impervious to the corruption 
that affects everyone else in the department. Apparently it's because Clay is 
played by Schroder, and we all know that Schroder's a good guy. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end, Schoffman hints that Clay too might be criminally culpable; he 
isn't granted immunity in exchange for his testimony. But this is simply 
forgotten by the next (and final) scene, when the miscreants are led out of 
court while Clay watches from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Although the roles are made out of cardboard, George Dzundza's performance as 
the dictatorial sheriff adds a fine-grained texture that isn't in the script. 
Schroder is less successful at deepening his role, but he does go through his 
good guy routine with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Jameson's direction seemed listless on the review tape, but this may have 
been due to the condition of the rough cut which was sent to reviewers. DON

EUDORA WELTY SEEN ON PBS THROUGH ENGLAND'S EYES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It happens too often to be a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons no council of sages could ever fathom, foreigners consistently 
display a surer fix on American culture than Americans do. The French see 
something in Jerry Lewis that passes right by most of Lewis' compatriots. The 
country with the biggest jazz following is Japan. The list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
So it's no surprise that it took England's "Omnibus" series on the BBC and 
director-producer Patchy Wheatley to bring us a sublime portrait of one of 
America's great fiction writers. Wheatley's "Eudora Welty -- One Writer's 
Beginnings" is the newest edition of the on-going PBS series "The American 
Experience" (Channels 15 and 28, 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
If the best thing that television can do is compel viewers to read about what 
they just saw, then this meticulously constructed portrait is television at its 
best. Wheatley used Welty's 1984 autobiography, "One Writer's Beginnings," as 
the basis for this exploration into the writer's mind, guided largely by Welty 
herself (with brief narration snippets by Charles Kuralt). 
</P>
<P>
Welty, now 79, still lives in her rambling family home in Jackson, Miss.; so 
completely has she managed to keep intact the threads to her past that her 
writing room is where she slept as a child. Though she cautions against the 
perennial trap of reading the author's life into the stories, it becomes clear 
how completely her sense of place in the Deep South formed the basis for the 
observant, sensual and gentle voice she adopted for her dozens of short stories 
and three novels. 
</P>
<P>
Two other keys to the making of this modest Southern genius emerge as well: 
Welty's nurturing parents, who regarded reading and learning as being as 
essential as breathing; and memory of the sights, sounds and smells of the 
past. Wheatley superbly finds a cinematic interpretation for this by 
interweaving old black-and-white footage and photos (shot by Welty and her 
father) into the new color footage. 
</P>
<P>
Again and again, the film finds the ideal accompanying images for Welty's brief 
recitations of short stories that suggest the power and range of the 
storyteller's passion to blend memory and imagination. ROBERT KOEHLER

SOVIET EMIGRES TO U.S. IN '89 MAY HIT 60,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MOSCOW 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Soviet authorities continue to relax restrictions on emigration, the United 
States is preparing to accept 50,000 to 60,000 of those who leave the Soviet 
Union in 1989, according to U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
The officials said the record influx will result from recent decisions by the 
Reagan Administration that effectively guarantee admission to the United States 
for about two-thirds of the Soviet citizens who, at the present rate of 
emigration, are likely to receive permission to leave next year. 
</P>
<P>
Current U.S. plans for 1989 provide for the acceptance of 25,000 immigrants, 
mostly Armenians and Jews, as "refugees," a legal status that will provide most 
with at least partial resettlement assistance and permanent residence after one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 2,000 people a month will be admitted to the United States this 
year direct from Moscow on a "humanitarian parole" authorized by the attorney 
general. 
</P>
<P>
And several hundred more Soviet emigrants are likely to be admitted on a 
similar basis each month from Rome and Vienna, the principal processing centers 
for Soviet Jews who choose to go to the United States rather than Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow expects to issue more than 1,000 
regular immigrant visas -- twice as many as this year and another record -- to 
Soviet citizens going to the United States to join relatives who had emigrated 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to accepting 50,000-plus," a U.S. official here said, "and 
the ultimate figure for 1989 could be much closer to 60,000 people. . . . From 
a country even the size of the Soviet Union, that is a major change in our 
immigration pattern." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30,000 in 1988 
</P>
<P>
The final tally for 1988 is expected to show more than 30,000 admissions, 
including Soviet Jews who officially leave for Israel but instead go to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Total Soviet emigration, mostly of Armenians, Jews and ethnic Germans, is 
currently running at more than 7,000 people a month, according to Soviet 
officials. That flow will probably increase as some people who have relatives 
abroad but who have been hesitant about applying to leave are encouraged by the 
new, streamlined process of handling emigration requests. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet emigration reached a peak in 1979 when 51,330 Jews left the country, 
according to the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Commission for Migration. 
Armenian and German emigration was also high in the late 1970s but nowhere near 
the number now. 
</P>
<P>
"Within a few months, we will not have an emigration problem any longer," a 
Soviet official predicted last month, "but you in the West will have an 
immigration problem as people take you at your word and ask to move to your 
country." 
</P>
<P>
The new policies will make the United States the largest recipient of Soviet 
emigrants, although West Germany received more than 35,000 ethnic Germans in 
1988 and expects to take in more than 40,000 in both 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities recently relaxed government regulations that for many years 
had restricted the emigration of scientists, engineers, former soldiers and 
others considered to have had access to state secrets. Last month, 120 Jewish 
"refuseniks" who had been denied permission to emigrate for a number of years 
were told that they would be allowed to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Some Soviet officials are now suggesting in human rights discussions that the 
flow could be increased even further if a proposed law on emigration permits 
Soviet citizens to leave the country without first receiving at least a nominal 
invitation from a family member abroad to settle with them. 
</P>
<P>
More Soviet Jews, for example, are now being permitted to emigrate directly to 
the United States -- where more than 90% of all Jewish emigrants end up, 
according to U.S. officials -- rather than declaring their intention to go to 
Israel and then changing their destination in Rome or Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of a shift are also appearing in the visa applications received by the 
U.S. Embassy here. From June to September, 95% of the applications came from 
Armenians, according to embassy officials. But in recent months, that figure 
has dropped to about 65%, with Jews accounting for 26% and Russians and members 
of the Baltic nationalities for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Another change has been the recent willingness of Soviet authorities to permit 
those intending to emigrate to approach the U.S. Embassy before they file their 
first papers. 
</P>
<P>
"Free emigration, as we would define the term, may never come to the Soviet 
Union," a West European diplomat said, recalling that his country, like the 
United States, has pressed hard for increased emigration in various human 
rights talks with Moscow. "Still, the volume of Soviet citizens leaving and 
settling elsewhere is getting to be such that this is starting to diminish as 
an issue in our discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge to us from the Soviets now is whether we will accept all these 
people. . . . We argue, of course, that the right of emigration does not imply 
an equal right of immigration, but we sound rather feeble when we say that." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. permission to go to America, a procedure that took three to four weeks in 
May or June, can now stretch up to a year, according to U.S. officials. The 
U.S. Embassy here has a backlog of 13,000 visa applications that grows by 2,000 
to 3,000 a month. And the Armenian earthquake on Dec. 7 is already bringing 
more applicants to the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Emigration to the United States was partially suspended July 1 when the State 
Department ran out of money to pay for the transportation and resettlement of 
thousands of Armenians, who were entitled to such federal assistance as soon as 
they were classified as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Jews, who are granted Soviet exit visas on the basis of their declarations that 
they are emigrating to Israel, have continued to be admitted to the United 
States through the Rome and Vienna processing centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not 'Refugees' 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, however, inspectors from the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service have classified about 200 Jews not as refugees fleeing 
persecution in the Soviet Union but as potential immigrants wanting to go to 
the United States for a better life. All were nevertheless granted special 
status to allow them to go to the United States immediately. 
</P>
<P>
This and related issues have been hotly debated within the Reagan 
Administration for the past year, with the arguments colored by conflicting 
views of developments in the Soviet Union as well as by the practical problems 
in handling the growing outflow of emigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The new policies were described by U.S. officials as largely a transitional 
program -- measures to ensure that everyone given Soviet permission to emigrate 
would be admitted to the United States without the usual long delays, but also 
to initiate a shift from the automatic granting of refugee status to every 
Soviet immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
While many U.S. officials continue to hold that anyone declaring his intention 
to emigrate from the Soviet Union -- a right insisted upon by the United States 
-- is effectively alienating himself from his own society and thus subject to 
persecution and entitled to refugee status, others say that U.S. policies 
should be shaped to the evolving situation here. 
</P>
<P>
"Legally, to grant refugee status, we are required to make a specific, 
individual determination on whether a person has a reasonable fear of 
persecution on the basis of his race, his religion, his political beliefs and 
so on," one U.S. official commented. "In fact, we said that anybody leaving the 
Soviet Union is a refugee by definition. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The fiscal realities -- we did not have enough money to pay everyone's 
transport and other costs -- have made us tighten up our approach and make 
those legally required individual determinations." 
</P>
<P>
The program for 1989 was drawn up in part on the basis of the federal and 
private funds available for refugee resettlement and on projections of the 
likely number of visa applications, based on requests over recent months, when 
they have flowed into the U.S. Embassy at the rate of about 200 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Processing of the backlog of applications under the new policies will begin 
next Tuesday, according to embassy officials, but delays of six to eight months 
may still occur. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know how many people are out there who want to leave," said one 
embassy officer, asking not to be quoted by name. "We were told, for example, 
that 80,000 Armenians want to go to the United States, but we know if that many 
do wind up going over a number of years that they will want to bring family 
members later. And nobody really knows how many Soviet Jews want to emigrate." 
</P>
<P>
Some experienced U.S. officials believe, however, that after an initial surge 
in emigration, the trend will drop off sharply if Moscow establishes a policy 
of free emigration.

USC DEFEATED; IRISH, UCLA WIN IN BOWLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Notre Dame staked a claim to its 14th national football championship, and the 
roses went to Michigan as the glut of college bowls wound up with an 
extravaganza of seven games Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Fighting Irish completed the first 12-0 season in their storied 
football history with a 34-21 victory over third-ranked, previously undefeated 
West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz., and the No. 11-ranked 
Woverines rallied in the second half to beat fifth-ranked USC, 22-14, in the 
75th Rose Bowl at Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-ranked UCLA upheld the honor of the Pacific 10 Conference, winning a 
record seventh straight bowl game by downing eighth-ranked Arkansas, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clemson Beats Oklahoma 
</P>
<P>
In other games, No. 13 Clemson beat No. 10 Oklahoma, 13-6, in the Citrus Bowl 
at Orlando, Fla., and No. 17 Syracuse dominated No. 16 Louisiana State, 23-10, 
in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
In night games, No. 2 Miami played No. 6 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl at Miami, 
and No. 4 Florida State faced No. 7 Auburn in the Sugar Bowl at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will likely receive its first national title since 1977 today when 
the Associated Press' final poll of the media is released. Coach Lou Holtz will 
join Irish coaches Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Dan Devine in winning 
national titles in their third seasons at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy won in 1943, 1946, 1947 and 1949, Parseghian in 1966 and 1973, and Devine 
in 1977. Knute Rockne won 6 other national titles before the AP poll began in 
1936. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Tony Rice led the way for Notre Dame, passing for 2 
touchdowns and a career-high 213 yards. Rice also rushed for 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame built a 23-6 half-time lead, and West Virginia (11-1) had to settle 
for the first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history. 
</P>
<P>
USC (10-2) had a 14-3 half-time lead but was overpowered by Michigan (9-2-1) in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler only his second victory in nine 
trips to the Rose Bowl and marked the first time the Big Ten had won 
consecutive Rose Bowls since the 1964-65 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan State defeated USC, 20-17, last year. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan fullback Leroy Hoard rushed for 142 yards and scored two 
fourth-quarter touchdowns. Hoard put the Wolverines ahead, 15-14, with a 1-yard 
touchdown run early in the final period, then locked up the victory with 
another 1-yard scoring run with 1:52 left. He set up the last touchdown with a 
61-yard gain to the Trojan 9. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rodney Peete, frustrated most of the game by the Michigan defense, 
scored for USC on runs of 1 and 4 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) used the efficiency of quarterback Troy Aikman and an overpowering 
defense to become the first school ever to win bowl games in 7 consecutive 
seasons -- all with Terry Donahue as coach -- before a partisan Arkansas crowd 
of 74,304. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' victory streak also includes 3 Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl, an Aloha 
Bowl and a Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 19 of 27 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown, and converted 
12 of 20 third-down situations into first downs. Freshman Shawn Wills gained 
121 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys are expected to make Aikman their first pick of the National 
Football League draft. Cowboy personnel director Gil Brandt congratulated 
Aikman under the goal posts after the game. 
</P>
<P>
However, it was the UCLA defense that carried the day, holding Arkansas (10-2) 
to 42 yards of offense and 4 first downs.

One hundred professors and prominent personalities have signed a petition 
asking the Polish government for open elections to the Sejm (Parliament) this 
year, a spokesman said. The petition, presented to the government ombudsman's 
office and given to Western news agencies, said any citizen should have the 
right to run for the Sejm after being nominated by a certain portion -- 
possibly 1% -- of eligible voters. Currently, nominations are controlled by the 
Communist Party, which in effect determines how many seats go to Communists, to 
allied political parties and to non-party members.

A 14-month-old Oakland boy died in a fire set off by a hot plate that his 
family was using to try to stay warm, authorities said. Fire officials said two 
of the three other occupants were taken to a hospital for treatment of smoke 
inhalation. The Alameda County coroner's office did not immediately release the 
identity of the dead child. Fire officials said the blaze was controlled within 
20 minutes.

A dealer, on trial for allegedly trading in thousands of stolen Nazi-era 
documents from U.S.-run archives, has handed over nearly 800 of the documents, 
the West German Justice Ministry said. Andre Huesken, a Hamburg dealer in 
military memorabilia, turned the material over to West Berlin court officials. 
A ministry spokeswoman said she did not know details of the contents. Huesken 
is charged with trading in goods stolen from the Nazi Document Center in West 
Berlin. He has been on trial since Dec. 5 with three other defendants. The Nazi 
Document Center, housing about 30 million files, is said to have the world's 
largest collection of Nazi records.

NATO ENDS FLIGHT BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

NATO forces resumed widely criticized, low-level training flights over West 
Germany after a three-week ban prompted by the crash of a U.S. military jet in 
the city of Remscheid, a military spokesman said. The crash killed five West 
Germans and the pilot. West German air force spokesman Peter Trittermann said 
no new measures have been taken to prevent such crashes because "we first have 
to wait for the results of the inquiry into the disaster." The report is 
expected Jan. 18. Opposition leaders have called for reductions in low-level 
flights, but Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party insists that 
the flights are vital to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

HEART TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT HAS BYPASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surgeons at University Medical Center in Tucson have performed what they said 
is history's first coronary bypass on a heart transplant recipient. Marjorie J. 
Rorabough, 59, received a new heart in a transplant in 1979 and Dr. Jack G. 
Copeland determined on New Year's Eve that a double bypass was necessary to 
help her cope with "life threatening" heart disease, said Jan Rooney, director 
of news communications for the hospital. Rorabough, of Loma Linda, Calif., was 
in critical but stable condition after the 7 1/2-hour surgery, Rooney said. 
Rorabough is the longest survivor among the 125 people who have received heart 
transplants at the medical center.

Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi said that Iran is nearing military 
self-sufficiency by building an advanced fighter plane and maintaining its 
aging U.S.-built F-4 and F-5 fighters, Tehran Television reported. Moussavi 
reportedly made the comment after inspecting Iranian air force facilities, but 
the televised report, monitored in Cyprus, showed footage of only one 
single-propeller trainer said to be locally built. He also said that Iran is 
now able to repair its U.S.-made Hawk surface-to-air missiles without outside 
help. Moussavi added that an Iranian-made passenger plane has been tested 
successfully and could be used for flights between smaller provincial cities.

Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, in an address in San Juan at the start of his 
second term, called for a plebiscite to give Puerto Ricans a choice of three 
alternatives: statehood, independence or more autonomy by expanding the present 
commonwealth status, granted in 1952. In a 1967 plebiscite, residents voted for 
more autonomy within the commonwealth, but it was never granted. The 
commonwealth agreement confirms Puerto Rico's exemption from U.S. income taxes 
and provides for a locally elected governor. But other U.S. laws apply to 
Puerto Rico. Residents may not vote for President, have no senators and their 
only congressional representative is a resident commissioner who can vote in 
committee but not on the floor.

THE 1989 TOURNAMENT OF ROSES PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
MECHANIC CREW'S 'FEARLESS LEADER' HELPS KEEP THE FLOATS AFLOAT 
</P>

Bobby Grossman is a 55-year-old truck mechanic who spends most of his time 
running a family-owned garage in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
But from Sunday evening to the early morning hours of Monday he wore another 
title: Rose Parade trouble-shooter, responsible for making sure that the 
mechanical guts of those complex Tournament of Roses floats would do what they 
were supposed to. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman is one of seven paid float mechanics who look after every phase of 
their construction, but he's developed a particularly strong reputation as an 
indispensable part of last-minute parade preparations, a man who can make 
things happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I may be the leader," said the parade's chief float mechanic, Michael J. 
Hoffman, "but he's the fearless leader." 
</P>
<P>
As Slice's "Hawaiian Luau" float failed to move at the start of Monday's 
parade, Grossman was summoned once again to fill the role of emergency 
repairman. Riding a motor scooter, he raced to the far end of the float lineup 
area, where the prize-winning entry was stranded with a broken steering 
mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
The float featured a 30-foot-long water flume with a waterfall and was carrying 
2,000 gallons of water taken from a roadside fire hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman this time was unable to solve the problem. But his mechanic's 
expertise enabled parade officials to know that the float could not be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman's theory was that a piece of the steering mechanism had been unable to 
handle the added weight of the water. After finishing his inspection, he told 
float builder Rick Chapman that tournament officials were going to take 
"Hawaiian Luau" out of the lineup and tow it to the post-parade display area. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the end of the parade," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The moment was the end of a long, otherwise uneventful night for the parade 
veteran, who studies each float months ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
By 6 p.m. Sunday, as the streets near the parade route began to fill up with 
spectators, Grossman took charge of moving the 29 floats stored in two areas 
across the street from the Rose Bowl to the formation area south of Colorado 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
As the drivers jockeyed the massive floats through the parking lots and onto 
Seco Street, Grossman raced back and forth among them, helping builders make 
last-minute adjustments to engines, check headsets and install tow bars. 
</P>
<P>
While the parade's float construction regulations appeared to limit the 
difficulties in Monday's pre-parade lineup, a number of minor problems flared 
up throughout the night. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, during a convoy of floats bound from a warehouse in Azusa, both 
the Carnation and Security Pacific National Bank entries developed problems 
with casters, small wheels that distribute the weight of the heavy floats. But 
those snags in the convoy's progress were solved within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the small things that foul people up," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
Take Lawry's prehistoric float, which began rattling loudly as the driver 
started the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman reached into the engine area and turned a valve on the fuel pump. The 
noise stopped immediately as fuel began to flow. 
</P>
<P>
"When (participants) get excited, they don't think of the easy, the simple 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's what I do. I look for things that can go wrong (with the floats) and I 
fix 'em." 
</P>
<P>
"He's really a great guy," said Charisma Float builder Ross Young, whose 
company designed and built Burger King's "Education Is the Solution" float. 
"The builders respect him because he knows what he's doing. He's been doing 
this for so long." 
</P>
<P>
Grossman, a Pasadena native, caught the parade bug when he was 14. Although he 
had no driver's license, he helped his father drive a float for the City of San 
Francisco -- a stylized trolley car. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't missed a parade since, and has been a Tournament of Roses member 
since 1972. "Doing float work is something that gets in your blood," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Grossman has been involved in various Tournament of Roses committees -- this 
year, he sat on the Coronation Committee -- but he is always counted on to make 
sure the float designs are up to parade specifications and completed on time. 
</P>
<P>
He and the other float mechanics begin their job of oversight in early spring, 
after builders and sponsors have agreed on which artist's renderings will 
become reality. 
</P>
<P>
"Artists. They can draw gorgeous pictures," Grossman said. "But you can't 
necessarily make a float the way the picture shows. . . . We go over 
everything" from inspecting the reusable chassis for possible stress overload 
to ensuring that the floats will adhere to the tournament's strict dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last week, Grossman was still inspecting a hinge that would 
lower the height of the Old North Church steeple on the Rand McNally float that 
celebrated Paul Revere's ride. The floats, although allowed to rise to heights 
over 50 feet, must be engineered to collapse to 17 feet, 4 inches -- just under 
the height of the Foothill Freeway overpass on Sierra Madre Boulevard.

SHIA MUSLIMS BATTLE 3RD DAY; 13 DIE, 39 HURT;

HIGH IRANIAN OFFICIAL TO TRY TO BRING PEACE

Rival Shia Muslim factions fought with grenades in Beirut and rockets in 
southern Lebanon's shattered apple orchards Monday, the third day of their 
latest battle in a sporadic war that began nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Police said eight people were killed and 25 wounded in the Shia slums of 
southern Beirut, and five were slain and 14 wounded in fighting near Israel's 
"security zone" along the border. 
</P>
<P>
Muslim-controlled Voice of the Nation radio said Iran is sending Deputy Foreign 
Minister Mohammed Javad Larijani to negotiate peace between Amal, a Shia 
militia backed by Syria, and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which has tried to 
expand its Beirut power base into southern Lebanon. The report gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty people have been killed and 47 wounded since the fighting began 
Saturday, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cease-Fire Short-Lived 
</P>
<P>
Syrian peacekeeping troops called a "total and comprehensive" cease-fire at 
midday, but it collapsed four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
A Syrian officer said Hezbollah was responsible for violating the truce. 
</P>
<P>
Bulldozers demolished sandbag barricades and earth mounds set up by both sides 
along a stretch of the Beirut slums along the highway to the international 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah fighters in black headbands hurled grenades in a charge backed by 
mortar fire and overran a police station in Beirut's Ghobeiri district, the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Amal militiamen responded with heavy fire from tanks stationed in nearby woods 
as a dozen policemen sprinted to safety under heavy rain, the spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
The explosions lit the night sky above the suburbs, home to about 500,000 
impoverished Shias. 
</P>
<P>
"Several fires are raging in the suburbs. Columns of smoke rising above the 
area can be seen from my house," said one resident of a section of Christian 
East Beirut that overlooks the area. 
</P>
<P>
Ambulances and rescue teams could not reach the scene of the fighting, and 
there were no immediate casualty reports. 
</P>
<P>
The police spokesman said the two sides were locked in house-to-house fighting 
in Ghobeiri and the neighboring district of Haret Hreik. 
</P>
<P>
Amal, a mainstream militia, and the fundamentalist Hezbollah (Party of God) are 
struggling for dominance of Lebanon's 1 million Shias, the largest sect in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Each accuses the other of starting the latest battle, their most intense since 
November, when 40 people were killed and 87 were wounded during six days of 
fighting in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Living in Basements 
</P>
<P>
Police said thousands of residents had been living in basements and bomb 
shelters since New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Several Beirut radio stations said Syria plans to review its deployment of 
4,500 soldiers in the slums to "improve their performance and prevent further 
fighting." 
</P>
<P>
Syria is Lebanon's main power broker and has about 40,000 soldiers in the 
country, including at least 7,500 in the Muslim sectors of Beirut. It first 
sent troops into the 16 square miles of southern Beirut slums in May, after a 
three-week battle between Amal and Hezbollah in which 300 people were killed 
and 1,000 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In southern Lebanon, the current fighting is the most serious between Amal and 
Hezbollah since four days in April, when 62 were killed and 150 wounded.

Philippine Airlines today identified four people authorities say are members of 
a radical Palestinian faction that has threatened to hijack or blow up an Asian 
airliner this month. 
</P>
<P>
An airline spokesman said the four -- Mudh Zaman Bakar, Muhen Barani, Mustafa 
Burani and Ahmed Yasar -- are believed to be members of Fatah Uprising, a 
Palestinian faction led by Abu Moussa. 
</P>
<P>
He said the names, provided by airport authorities in Tokyo, have prompted the 
Manila aiport to carefully screen passengers from South Asia and the Mideast. 
The suspects are believed to be carrying passports from India, Pakistan and 
Oman. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Asian aviation officials said they were warned by Air-India of a 
possible attack on an Asian aircraft by Jan. 10.

U.S. CONFIRMS ASKING PLO FOR AID; 
</P>
<P>
SEEKS ANY INFORMATION GROUP HAS ON PAN AM BOMBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The United States, seeking widespread assistance in determining who was 
responsible for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, has asked the Palestine 
Liberation Organization for any information it can provide, a White House 
spokesman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO representative to whom the request was presented said it would be 
passed along to Yasser Arafat, the PLO chairman, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure followed a report in a London newspaper that Arafat had offered 
such help -- an offer, if the report is correct, that U.S. officials have said 
they know nothing about. 
</P>
<P>
"We've not heard from him. If he has anything to tell us, I'm sure he'll tell 
us," President Reagan said Monday morning, in response to questions shouted to 
him at Los Angeles International Airport as he returned to his new home in 
Bel-Air after a New Year's holiday in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. officials sought to play down the request to the PLO, presenting it 
as one of numerous requests the government has made for any information about 
the Dec. 21 crash, it reflects the sudden, tentative steps toward improved 
relations between the United States and the Palestinian organization that U.S. 
officials have viewed in the past as playing a major role in Middle East 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
However, although such approaches on the political level are extremely new, the 
CIA is known to have maintained a liaison with the PLO for many years, and the 
contacts have occasionally produced useful information. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. request to the PLO was made Saturday, when Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., 
the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, held an informal, get-acquainted meeting with 
the PLO's representative to Tunisia and the Arab League, Hakam Balaaoui, 
according to Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk. 
</P>
<P>
Popadiuk said the meeting, held at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, had been set up 
at Balaaoui's request. Balaaoui had not attended the Dec. 16 meeting between 
Pelletreau and two members of the PLO Executive Committee. That meeting broke a 
13-year public freeze on contacts between the United States and the PLO. It 
followed Arafat's statement in Geneva last month in which he renounced 
terrorism and met other U.S. conditions for resumed contacts. 
</P>
<P>
"The ambassador took the opportunity to mention that the United States would 
welcome any information the PLO is able to develop concerning the Pan Am 
tragedy," Popadiuk said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials characterized the PLO official's response as: "Thank you for 
your views, and I'll pass it on to Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, Bassam abu Sharif, spokesman for the PLO, told the Cable News Network 
that Arafat will cooperate with the investigation but that the PLO chairman has 
no information yet about who put the bomb aboard the Pan American World Airways 
jumbo jet. After a midair explosion, the airliner crashed in a Scottish 
village, killing all 259 people aboard and at least 11 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Arafat has been very explicit and crystal-clear when he condemned 
terrorism, all forms of terrorism," Abu Sharif said. "I don't think the 
chairman will come short of helping bring justice against those who are sick in 
their minds and carried out such operations, although the proof is not yet 
established who was behind it." 
</P>
<P>
Popadiuk, the White House spokesman, said the meeting between Pelletreau and 
Balaaoui centered on Middle East issues. "Since the meeting was called by Mr. 
Balaaoui, the ambassador was principally in a listening mode," Popadiuk said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Reagan had been informed about the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, reflecting sensitivity to fears that the U.S.-PLO rapprochement 
might be moving too fast, took pains to stress that Pelletreau's remarks to the 
Palestinian representative were a request for information only, not more 
substantial assistance. It arose, they said, as the two men discussed various 
Middle East issues.

BOMB THREATS SPARK AIR SECURITY ALERT

Three bomb threats -- at least one apparently linked to Stockholm's role in the 
opening of a U.S.-PLO dialogue -- prompted Scandinavian Airlines System to 
mount one of its tightest security operations ever on Monday, disrupting the 
airline's flights worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
An English-speaking caller telephoned the airline and said an internal flight 
from Gothenburg in western Sweden would be sabotaged on Monday morning, the 
airline reported. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third threat SAS has made public. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were delays on all SAS flights Monday because of security 
checks, no signs of sabotage were found. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are taking all the threats seriously, and security is stringent at all 
our airports," airline spokesman John Herbert said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the airline said it had received a letter saying an SAS plane on a 
domestic route would be attacked because of Sweden's mediating role that led to 
the United States opening direct talks with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
That threat was followed by a tip-off from Interpol, the international police 
organization, that an unidentified group may be planning to attack one of its 
planes, causing SAS to alert its staff around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert said Swedish secret police had not been able to specify who had made 
the threat, which came from Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert said there was no information suggesting that either threat was linked 
to last month's crash of a Pan Am Boeing 747 in Scotland that killed all 259 on 
board and at least 11 people on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
He said the extra security had already caused severe delays and would mean 
extra costs for the airline, in which the governments of Sweden, Norway and 
Denmark share a 50% stake. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of security measures following the threats, some charter flights 
have been delayed by up to 13 hours. Scheduled flights have suffered much 
shorter delays. 
</P>
<P>
Swedish newspapers speculated that an Iranian fundamentalist group was planning 
an attack as revenge for Sweden's recent involvement in the negotiations with 
the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert said he had no such information. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we have no idea who is behind this. But Interpol has advised us to 
consider the latest threat seriously," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden in early December arranged a meeting between PLO leader Yasser Arafat 
and a group of prominent American Jews, and soon afterward the PLO made clear 
its implicit recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden was instrumental in coaxing Arafat to clarify the PLO stand at a news 
conference in Geneva, a move that persuaded Washington to open talks for the 
first time in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the West German state attorney's office in Frankfurt, where Pan 
Am flight 103 originated with a smaller plane Dec. 21, said Monday that 
investigators have found that freight, including four bags of U.S. military 
mail, was loaded on the plane without security checks. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the freight was loaded on the Pan Am 727 that flew the first 
leg of Flight 103 from Frankfurt and transferred to the ill-fated Boeing 747 in 
London, again without a security check. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the mail bags were "constantly guarded by U.S. military 
personnel." 
</P>
<P>
The West German weekly Bunte said Monday that a document box from Manufacturers 
Hanover Trust also was loaded in Frankfurt and transferred in London without 
being checked. 
</P>
<P>
The German spokesman said investigators are still examining the possibility 
that a bomb was loaded on Flight 103 in Frankfurt but so far have found "no hot 
trail." 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, police discovered an arms cache of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command in Frankfurt that included the 
Czech-made plastic explosive Semtex and an altitude detonator. Semtex or a 
plastic explosive like it is suspected of causing the Pan Am crash.

CONGRESS CONVENES TODAY, FACING BUDGET DEFICIT, OTHER OLD PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new Congress convenes today, awaiting a new President to deal with some of 
the same old problems that plagued its predecessors, including a massive 
federal budget deficit that could threaten the nation's economic health. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate and House were called into ceremonial sessions to swear in new 
members and install Democratic leaders, who said that they expect more 
cooperation from President-elect George Bush than the last Congress had from 
departing President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush -- who as vice president will have the unusual duty Wednesday of 
announcing to the 101st Congress his own election to the White House by the 
Electoral College -- may be on a collision course with Capitol Hill over ways 
to reduce a budget deficit estimated at $150 billion in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan will initiate the 1989 debate on the issue on Jan. 9 by sending Congress 
his final budget -- which Bush is expected to modify shortly after taking 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The budget plans must attempt to lower red-ink spending to $100 billion by 
October, 1990, to avoid automatic, across-the-board spending cuts mandated by 
the Gramm-Rudman budget law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Chairmen of Key Panels 
</P>
<P>
Bush will be dealing with new chairmen of the Senate and House budget 
committees -- Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) and Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey) 
-- in his struggle to bring the deficit down without violating his campaign 
pledge of "no new taxes." Many Democrats in Congress believe it cannot be done 
without making unacceptable spending reductions and that tax increases are 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, 
already has advocated an increase of 10 or 15 cents a gallon in the federal 
gasoline tax to ease the budget crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Without any reduction of the deficit, many economists believe, interest rates 
will rise and threaten the continuation of the seven-year economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Other controversial issues include a 50% pay raise for members of Congress, a 
bankruptcy crisis in the savings and loan industry, planned closing of dozens 
of military bases, obsolescence of nuclear weapons production plants and the 
thorny problems of ethics in government and campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Re-Examine Benefits 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a strong backlash by senior citizens against surtaxes in a new 
Medicare law to provide insurance against catastrophic health care costs may 
force Congress to reconsider both the benefits it provided and the financing 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
Advocates of the equal rights amendment have indicated that they will 
reintroduce that controversial legislation on the first day of the new session. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many lawmakers want to revive some bills vetoed by Reagan in the 
waning days of the last Congress, including legislation to deal with child 
pornography on television and a measure that attempts to regulate the 
"revolving door" into lobbying jobs for newly departed government officials or 
members of Congress and their top aides. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) remains under investigation by 
the House Ethics Committee on charges of misusing his office and campaign 
funds. Although he denies any wrongdoing, House Republican adversaries have 
indicated that they will make enforcement of ethics rules a major issue in the 
new session. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Impact of New Leadership 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, the advent of Sen. George J. Mitchell of Maine as the new 
Democratic leader is expected to place more emphasis on environmental 
legislation, including renewal of the Clean Air Act, which was stymied when 
coal-state Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.) held the leadership post. 
</P>
<P>
As usual when there is a change of administrations, Congress will get off to a 
slow start after Bush and his vice president, Dan Quayle, take their oaths of 
office in the Jan. 20 inaugural ceremonies. For example, the lawmakers will 
take a two-week break after their two-day work period this week. 
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, major committees will take several weeks to conduct hearings and 
vote on confirmation of Bush's nominations of Cabinet secretaries before 
starting work on legislation. The new President is expected to spell out his 
program in an address to a joint session of Congress in the first week or two 
after his swearing-in. 
</P>
<P>
The makeup of the House and Senate will be pretty much the same as it was in 
the 100th Congress, which adjourned Oct. 21. The Senate will welcome 11 
freshmen, including Rep. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), who was appointed to finish the 
last two years of Quayle's unexpired Senate term. Democrats will have a 55-45 
majority, compared to 54 to 46 in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democrats' Lead in House 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Democrats picked up three seats in the November election to gain 
a 260-175 advantage. However, Coats' elevation to the Senate and the death of 
Rep. Bill Nichols (D-Ala.) last month will change the opening-day margin to 259 
to 174, with two vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, in outlining his own agenda at a meeting of the Democratic caucus last 
month, said he expected the House to pass a strengthened Clean Air Act, as well 
as legislation to prevent unlimited takeovers and mergers of the largest 
corporations and an election reform law that would include uniform poll-closing 
hours across the nation in presidential election years. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of California and other Western states have contended that television 
network projections of presidential winners on the basis of early returns from 
the East and Midwest have sharply lowered voter turnout in the West.

U.S. Rep. Howard Wolpe will be sworn in for a sixth term at a hospital where he 
is recovering from surgery on his left knee, a spokeswoman said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Kalamazoo Democrat will be sworn in today at Bronson Methodist Hospital in 
Kalamazoo and will miss ceremonies scheduled in Washington for members of 
Congress, Link Nicoll said. 
</P>
<P>
Wolpe's knee problems stem from a series of sports injuries, Nicoll said. He 
entered the hospital on Dec. 12 for outpatient surgery, but an infection forced 
him to undergo surgery again. 
</P>
<P>
Wolpe has been hospitalized since his second operation on Dec. 29, Nicoll said, 
adding that no date for his release has been set.

MONTANA INSTALLS A GOP GOVERNOR; UTAH'S BANGERTER STARTS 2ND TERM 
</P>

<P>
Two Republican governors were sworn in Monday, as the governor of Utah began a 
second term and a Canadian-born governor-elect took office in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Stephens, a former Montana state senator, is the first Republican elected 
governor since Tim Babcock left office 20 years ago. Stephens took the oath in 
Helena after Allen Kolstad, a farmer-businessman from Chester and also a former 
state senator, was sworn in as lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, Norman H. Bangerter, who barely survived a three-way 
gubernatorial contest in November, was sworn in for a second term as Utah's 
13th governor before a crowd of 1,400 at the Capitol Rotunda. Val Oveson, the 
incumbent lieutenant governor, also took the oath. 
</P>
<P>
Bangerter, 55, had trailed Democrat Ted Wilson by more than 30 percentage 
points in the polls last summer. He won a 40%-38% victory over Wilson with 22% 
of the vote going to independent candidate Merrill Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens, 59, told his audience at the Capitol in Helena that he assumed the 
job of chief executive with a "deep sense of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
"The Montana economy has been depressed," Stephens said. "We have endured the 
ravages of drought and forest fires and of being perceived negatively on the 
barometric scales of business and commerce."

DAMAGE IN DIKE BREAK PUT AT 'TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS'; 
</P>
<P>
UTAH AREA CLEANING UP AFTER FLOODING 
</P>

<P>
Volunteers on Monday cleaned up tons of debris left behind by a wall of water 
that swept through a broken dike and into communities downstream, causing what 
the governor said was "tens of millions of dollars" in damage. 
</P>
<P>
"All you can do is get in and dig some more -- just dig out," one volunteer 
said. "We've got a lot of people helping us." 
</P>
<P>
The dike, adjacent to the Quail Creek Reservoir, about 300 miles southwest of 
Salt Lake City, gave way eight minutes into the New Year, Tony Hafen, 
Washington County emergency services director, said. 
</P>
<P>
Floodwaters raced down the Virgin River, invaded about 60 homes and 100 
apartments and forced the evacuation of about 1,500 people, authorities said. 
However, there were no reports of people injured or missing. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Norman H. Bangerter, who flew to St. George to inspect the flood-stricken 
area, said Monday in Salt Lake City that, although damage estimates are still 
being added up, the destruction will carry a big price tag. 
</P>
<P>
"I would imagine it would be in the tens of millions of dollars when you 
consider the dike and the bridges and the roads and the personal property" 
lost, Bangerter told United Press International. "But there's no official 
number on that at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities had spotted a leak in the dam early and said the fact that many 
people were up late celebrating the New Year helped in the rapid evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Hansen, who had just sold her home in the exclusive Bloomington Hills 
area, said she had only a few minutes to move her most valuable possessions 
before evacuating. 
</P>
<P>
"We just closed the deal Friday. I guess the deal's off," said Hansen, who 
estimated that there was $40,000 in damage to the home. 
</P>
<P>
The rushing waters carved a 300-foot hole in the half-mile-long earthen dike, 
which had a history of leaking. 
</P>
<P>
But officials were still investigating what caused it to give way. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allowed the evacuated residents back into their homes after the 
floods subsided Sunday, but some still remained displaced because of extensive 
water and mud damage. 
</P>
<P>
Interstate 15, the main route between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, was 
closed for about 12 hours. State Road 9 remained closed because of washed-out 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Several Mormon churches canceled Sunday services and dispatched members to lend 
a hand in bucket brigades bailing out mud and water from damaged homes. 
</P>
<P>
Bangerter, who was sworn in Monday for a second term, briefly referred to the 
flooding in his inauguration speech, pledging that the broken dike will be 
repaired. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of Washington County and the people of the state will not give in," 
he said. "As they have done in those valleys for nearly 150 years, they will 
rebuild as many times as it takes." 
</P>
<P>
After passing through the southwestern Utah communities, the flood rushed 
toward southeastern Nevada, but the waters were lower by the time they arrived 
and caused only minimal damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We had about 12 hours' advance warning," said Police Chief Arvie Kelley of 
Mesquite, Nev. "We did quite well. We did not evacuate; we didn't have to. We 
just warned people." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Owens, a geologist and engineer with Rollins, Brown &amp; Gunnell, which 
designed the dike, said millions of dollars had been spent on repairs since the 
dike was dedicated in September, 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"The company felt like it was making progress," Owens said.

FUMES IN CAMPER SUFFOCATE MOTHER, 3 CHILDREN 
</P>

<P>
A mother and her three children suffocated in the back of a pickup truck as the 
father drove home from a holiday in Mexico, unaware that deadly carbon monoxide 
fumes had seeped into the camper shell, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Customs inspectors at the Port of Entry here found the four unconscious when 
the father pulled up to the border station at 12:35 a.m. Monday after a three- 
to four-hour wait in bumper-to-bumper traffic, Police Sgt. Bill Matus said. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that there were holes in the bed of the pickup truck that allowed 
carbon monoxide to seep into the camper shell," Customs spokesman John Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Customs inspectors attempted to revive the four with cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and oxygen, and paramedics arrived almost immediately. But 
officials at Calexico hospital pronounced the woman and children dead on 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were identified as Micaela Iniguez Aguilar, 26; and Horacio, 6; 
Francisco Javiar, 4, and Camilio, 3. 
</P>
<P>
The father, Horacio Aguilar, 36, was unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
Matus said the family, all Mexican nationals who lived in the United States as 
resident aliens, were returning to the San Joaquin Valley town of Laton after a 
holiday visit to Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
The four deaths led Customs officers and Calexico police to alert their Mexican 
counterparts, who went through the line of cars approaching the border station 
to warn motorists about carbon monoxide dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 1 1/2 hours later, a U.S. Customs inspector found two other children 
unconscious in the back of another pickup with a camper shell. The children in 
the second truck, Angelica Ortega, 11, and Armando Ortega, 12, of Niland, 
Calif., were revived, but remained hospitalized for observation, said Customs 
spokeswoman Bobbie Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
Several factors were cited by officials as leading to Monday's tragedy, 
believed to be the first such incident in the Calexico Port of Entry's 15 years 
of operation, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday traffic caused a massive backup at the border station about 100 miles 
east of San Diego. "That could have contributed to the whole thing," Matus 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller declined comment on the delays, except to say that all eight lanes at 
the border station were open. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said the truck's faulty exhaust system and a cold night also were 
factors. The camper shell's windows were closed to ward off the cold, 
preventing fresh air from flushing out the odorless and invisible carbon 
monoxide fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Miller added that one of the primary symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning is 
drowsiness, which left the four particularly vulnerable because they were 
resting at the time the gas leaked into the compartment. 
</P>
<P>
The Customs spokesman said he expects a review of the case to be made to see if 
procedures could be revised to help prevent a repetition of such accidents.

9 DIE ON AREA HIGHWAYS; 411 ARRESTED AS DRUNK DRIVERS

At least nine people were killed in Los Angeles County traffic accidents over 
the New Year's holiday weekend -- among them a 12-year-old girl who died Monday 
morning after the camper van in which she and seven of her relatives were 
riding was struck by a car and flipped over on the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly the whole family was thrown onto the roadway when their vehicle turned 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"The camper basically kind of disintegrated," said California Highway Patrol 
Officer Bob Weaver. "The sides ripped open and out they went." 
</P>
<P>
In other accidents: 
</P>
<P>
* A 10-month-old girl died in a Pomona crash, despite being strapped into an 
infant car seat. 
</P>
<P>
* A 6-year-old boy was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
* A Lawndale man died when the car he was a passenger in slammed into a divider 
on the Harbor Freeway, flipped and burst into flames. Authorities said the 
driver was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
* Three pedestrians died in traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statewide Toll 
</P>
<P>
The weekend fatalities were among 33 traffic-related deaths statewide between 6 
p.m. Friday and 6 a.m. Monday, according to statistics compiled by the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, 35 people died in traffic accidents in the same period, CHP Officer 
Monty Kiefer said. 
</P>
<P>
In the fatal accident on the Long Beach Freeway the camper was traveling north 
near Rosecrans Avenue at about 11:35 a.m. when a car drifted out of its lane 
and struck the camper, sending it out of control, CHP Officer Bob Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
The camper struck the freeway divider, spun around and flipped, throwing the 
12-year-old girl and five other passengers onto the road. 
</P>
<P>
The driver and front-seat passenger were not ejected, Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident left another child, a 10-year-old girl, with "major injuries," and 
a 69-year-old woman and 6-year-old girl with "moderate injuries," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
The seven passengers and driver of the camper, who Weaver said apparently were 
going on a family outing, were from Long Beach and Compton and all female, 
ranging in age from 4 to 69. The children's names were not released; the adults 
were identified as driver Martha Abuhijleh, 37, of Long Beach; Olivia Gonzalez, 
69, of Compton, and Cleo Gonzalez, 41, also of Compton. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the driver of the car nor his passenger was injured. The driver, 
identified as Jorge Higueros, 36, of Paramount, fled from the scene on foot and 
was being sought, Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>
Also during the holiday weekend reporting period, Kiefer said, CHP officers in 
the Los Angeles area arrested 411 people on suspicion of drunk driving, down 
from 443 last year. Statewide, the CHP cited 1,725 drivers for drunk driving, 
three more than were cited during the 1987-88 holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, one man arrested on suspicion of drunk driving also faces 
possible felony manslaughter charges in the Harbor Freeway accident in which 
his car crashed into the divider and caught fire, killing his passenger. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred just south of 135th Street at about 10:45 p.m. Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer said the driver, Rene Rodriguez, 21, of Lawndale, entered the southbound 
lanes of the freeway at El Segundo Boulevard, accelerated to nearly 100 m.p.h. 
and then swerved into the center divider to avoid hitting another car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passenger Trapped 
</P>
<P>
Passenger Raul Trevino, 28, also of Lawndale, was trapped when the car crashed, 
but Rodriguez escaped with minor injuries and was being held in the jail ward 
of County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer said two pedestrians were killed Saturday -- a 30-year-old Temple City 
woman who was struck while walking in El Monte, and a man, about 18, who was 
struck and killed in North Hollywood. Also on Saturday, a man, about 35, was 
killed in an accident in Downey. Details of the accidents and identities of the 
victims were not available. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, traffic accidents claimed three lives, including two children. So 
Den Taing, 6, was killed in Long Beach after a hit-and-run-driver struck him 
and a 5-year-old girl, dragging them both for nearly half a block. The girl, 
Anika Elk, was in critical condition at St. Mary Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Ten-month-old Candice Smith died after her mother's car collided with a pickup 
truck at Arrow Highway and Garey Avenue in Pomona. Pomona police said one of 
the cars ran a red light, but it was unclear which driver was at fault. 
</P>
<P>
Both drivers suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-year-old man was pronounced dead at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center after he drove his car into a pole at the corner of Alameda and 103rd 
streets at about 1 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Kiefer said authorities believe the man, who was not identified, was "asleep or 
drunk or both."

WHEN THE SURF BEATS TURF ON BOWL DAY; 
</P>
<P>
WET-SUIT SET STORMS BEACHES FOR SOME GOOD WAVES OF WINTER 
</P>

Clint West didn't spend all day Monday glued to the tube watching college 
football bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the 30-year-old Malibu resident threw on his wet suit, rubbed some wax 
on his surfboard and headed down to the Huntington Beach Pier, where he plopped 
in the 54-degree water and paddled out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather be surfing, if you really want to know," he grinned. "I can always 
tape the football games." 
</P>
<P>
About 800 like-spirited individuals crowded into the waves Monday around the 
pier, a Southern California surf mecca. The crowd was reported considerably 
larger than on a normal winter weekday, as it was at Newport Beach, Bolsa Chica 
and other county surf spots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disputes Flare Over Room 
</P>
<P>
No serious problems were reported from crowding, although surfers complained of 
disputes that occasionally flared into arguments. The battles tended to center 
along generational lines. 
</P>
<P>
"The little kids get in the older guys' way," veteran surfer Tom Yellow 
grumbled as he dried out on shore with a yellow board in hand. Yellow, who 
would not give his age, was referring to surfers older "than 30." 
</P>
<P>
"All the old men think they own the place," countered 15-year-old Joe Vedder of 
Huntington Beach, who was resting between waves with his buddies, James 
Nichols, 16, and Matt Eveler, 15. 
</P>
<P>
Young and old alike bobbed in rolling, foam-crested waves as Huntington Beach 
lifeguards reported "fair to good" surfing conditions. Waves of up to 3 feet 
rolled in all day, pushed up into desireable peaks by opposing south and 
westerly winds. 
</P>
<P>
The springlike, 60-degree temperatures ashore also drew out holiday strollers 
and even a few hardy sunbathers. Picture-perfect skies were reported throughout 
the county, where temperatures reached as high as 69 degrees in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Rain and cold weather last week had kept surfing to a minimum. But a weak Santa 
Ana wind condition cleared the skies Sunday and Monday, bringing in crowds. The 
National Weather Service called for continued sunny and clear conditions 
through this afternoon, when a polar storm system will bring partly cloudy 
skies and a 20% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
At the Huntington Beach Pier on Monday, surfers came from as far away as South 
Africa. But most were like Chad Stevens, 14, and his friend, Chris Eso, 13, who 
took the bus from their homes in Brea -- a 1 1/2-hour trip. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said he was trying out some new surf boots he got for Christmas. 
Lifeguards attributed the heavy turnout to young surfers, out of school for the 
holidays, who were trying out new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the young surfers posed a danger in the water, said Marc Panis, a city 
marine safety officer for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"You get kids with brand new boards who don't know anything," Panis said. "They 
don't even know to put wax on their boards, and they just slip right off. But 
what they don't realize is that you can get killed by one of those boards." 
</P>
<P>
And many young surfers fail to observe etiquette by relinquishing a wave to 
someone who has already caught it, said Michael Locke, 20, a 10-year surfer 
from Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, some of the younger surfers get hit by boards, which he 
said happened earlier Monday when his board grazed a 9-year-old surfer who 
would not get out of his way. 
</P>
<P>
"This is when it gets dangerous," he said. "Kids don't watch out enough. 
</P>
<P>
They're just happy to have their new boards." 
</P>
<P>
However, West of Malibu said older surfers can prove equally dangerous by 
trying to compete for every wave. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was a particularly competitive day because the good waves were 
relatively few and far between, he said, adding: "Everyone wants the same 
wave." 
</P>
<P>
Even with the increased competition, all surfers interviewed Monday agreed that 
the winter surf crowds are preferable to those in the summer. Mike Bowma, 19, 
of Lakewood said there are so many surfers in the summer that it is almost 
impossible to find a place near the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
"In the summer you also get more tourists -- people who don't know what they're 
doing," said Bowma, who drove to Huntington Beach on Monday with two friends. 
</P>
<P>
Surfers said the winter conditions are better than summer because winter's 
northerly swells are generally much larger than the southerly swells common in 
summer. Surfer Jim Quick of Lakewood said the bigger winter swells scare off 
the inexperienced, leaving the water open to veteran surfers -- except during 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran surfer Yellow said he had intended Monday to spend the entire day 
riding waves. But frustrated by the holiday crowding in the water, Yellow -- 
who has been surfing in Huntington Beach for 15 years -- retired to his van, 
where he keeps a TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm gonna watch a football game," Yellow, a meat cutter from Huntington Beach, 
said about noon Monday, "and I'll go back surfing tomorrow when all the kids 
have gone back to school."

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL FOR HEALTH STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton has announced that for the second year in a row, 100% of 
its Health Professions Program students who applied to professional schools 
were accepted. The applicants were students seeking admittance to medical, 
dental or other health-related schools. 
</P>
<P>
Miles D. McCarthy, emeritus professor of biology and coordinator of the Health 
Professions Program, said Cal State Fullerton's work in preparing students for 
advanced health-care study has gained a very favorable national reputation. 
</P>
<P>
He said the university had been moving up in recent years in the percentage of 
students accepted for professional schools, culminating in the past 2 years 
with 100% acceptances. "Since 1980, the acceptance rate has climbed above the 
85% mark every year but one and has passed the 90% mark four times," McCarthy 
said.

LOCAL LAWS '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year, local and municipal governments approved many new laws and 
regulations that will affect many residents throughout the region. In Los 
Angeles County, owners of biting dogs will pay more in fines, while city 
residents will feel a pinch in the wallet from higher fees for water, sewer and 
power. Burbank has placed restrictions on metal balloons and the homeless won't 
be able to sleep in West Hollywood parks overnight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County 
</P>
<P>
DOGS -- Fines against owners for dog bites were increased from a maximum of 
$500 to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
SYPHILIS -- Treatment and prevention programs for syphilis were expanded and, 
for a six-month period, the county waived the $20 fee charged for diagnosis and 
treatment of all venereal diseases and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
DISPLAY -- Limits were placed on the display of sexually oriented materials in 
news racks. 
</P>
<P>
LIQUOR -- The supervisors made it harder to get a liquor license in East Los 
Angeles. Zoning approval is now granted only after local residents are given a 
chance to protest. Limits were placed on granting the licenses near schools, 
playgrounds and churches. 
</P>
<P>
PARKING -- More parking is now required for several traffic-generating 
enterprises, including animal hospitals, medical offices and galleries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
POLICE -- The number of Los Angeles police officers was increased by 150 to a 
record level of 7,500. A new deputy chief job was authorized to assist in 
fighting drug-related gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
FINES -- Rush-hour parking fines were increased from $28 to $53 in an effort to 
deter motorists from blocking intersections. 
</P>
<P>
WATER -- A number of measures were passed by the City Council and signed by the 
mayor to save water, both because of a series of dry years and the need to 
reduce the amount of water flowing into the city's inadequate sewage disposal 
system. Residents are forbidden to hose down patios, sidewalks and driveways. 
Restaurants now can serve water only upon request. Property owners must repair 
leaking faucets and toilets. Residents are requested to voluntarily reduce 
water use by 10%. Decorative fountains without recycling features are banned. 
Water-saving toilet and shower devices, provided by the Los Angeles Department 
of Water and Power, must be installed by Jan. 13. Also, a new ordinance took 
effect limiting construction in neighboring cities connected to the Los Angeles 
sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
SEWERS -- Average monthly residential sewer fees were increased from $6.14 to 
$17.52 per month by 1993 to help pay for the rebuilding and modernization of 
the city's aging sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
RATES -- Water and power rates went up about $6 on the average bimonthly 
residential bill. The average bimonthly electric bill was increased from $65 to 
$67.84 and the average bimonthly water rate increased from $34.98 to $38.32. 
Lifeline customers received an increase from about $26.86 to $27.86. 
</P>
<P>
HIGH-RISE -- Following the fire in the First Interstate Bank building in 
downtown Los Angeles, pre-1974 high-rises were required to be retrofitted with 
automatic sprinklers, fire-resistant elevator vestibules and roof-top smoke 
escapes within three years. 
</P>
<P>
RESTROOMS -- Businesses with customer and employee restrooms were required to 
make them available to the disabled even if they are not patrons. 
</P>
<P>
ANIMALS -- In January, an ordinance took effect that prohibits feeding of 
coyotes, raccoons, foxes, skunks and opossums. Dog license fees were increased 
from $16 to $18, but license fees for spayed or neutered dogs remained 
unchanged at $8. 
</P>
<P>
CRUISING -- Motor vehicles are now limited to a round trip every six hours on 
streets where police determine that cruising is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
CAR POOLING -- Employers with at least 200 workers now must offer $15 bus 
passes, car-pool and van-pool subsidies each month if they also provide 
subsidized parking. New laws make available up to $5,000 to employers for lease 
or purchase of employee commuter vans. Rates were increased for parking spaces 
on city-owned or city-leased lots in the downtown area from $5 to $25, with 
car-poolers exempted. 
</P>
<P>
AMBULANCES -- Six additional rescue ambulances for paramedics were approved for 
South-Central Los Angeles, East San Fernando Valley and the Harbor area. 
</P>
<P>
BINGO -- Nightly bingo sessions at a single location are limited to 40 games to 
reduce the amount of prize money available. 
</P>
<P>
LEAVE -- Unmarried Los Angeles city employees living with a "domestic partner" 
are entitled to the same sick and bereavement leaves as married workers. 
</P>
<P>
CULTURE -- Los Angeles got its first municipal culture program of grants and 
other assistance to art, the theater and other cultural activities, financed by 
$20 million a year coming from fees and the city's hotel bed tax. 
</P>
<P>
MALLS -- Parking restrictions were tightened for mini-malls and requirements 
were added for decoration and shade trees. 
</P>
<P>
SLUMLORDS -- Tenants in slum buildings now have the option to put rent into a 
"rent escrow account program," maintained by the city, rather than pay it to 
landlords who refuse to repair their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
PARKS -- City Council was criticized after it approved park regulations that 
the homeless said discriminate against them. Over complaints of discrimination 
by the homeless, the City Council closed city parks from midnight to 6 a.m., 
outlawed such activities as erecting tents, using drinking fountains for "other 
than their intended purpose" and hanging clothes and blankets on walls and 
shrubs. Sheriff's Department deputies are empowered to expel violators from 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agoura Hills 
</P>
<P>
SPRINKLERS -- An ordinance was passed in July requiring automatic sprinkler 
systems in all new homes, making the city the first in Los Angeles County to 
impose such a requirement. City Council acted soon after the May 4 fire at the 
downtown First Interstate Bank building but officials said the idea was 
conceived months earlier in the brush-fire prone city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Burbank 
</P>
<P>
BALLOONS -- Law made effective in June requires businesses that sell metallic 
balloons to post signs warning of the hazards of metallic balloons near sources 
of electrical power. The legislation was prompted by several incidents of such 
balloons causing outages when they collided with power lines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
San Fernando 
</P>
<P>
NOISE -- Under a new city ordinance, hosts of loud and unruly parties can be 
fined up to $500 if police are summoned more than once to quiet the 
festivities. Police first issue a written warning to the hosts of noisy 
parties. If called again, officers write up a bill at the scene, with the fee 
being determined in part by the number of officers who responded. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lakewood 
</P>
<P>
SMOKING -- As of October, smoking is restricted to limited, specified areas in 
city-owned buildings. Businesses are required to submit written policy 
statements to the city detailing the extent to which they will restrict 
smoking, or they may have a policy statement of no restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION -- An Office of Neighborhoods and Historical Preservation was 
created to try to identify and save significant historic buildings in the city. 
City Council action came as final demolition occurred on two well-known 
landmark buildings, the Pacific Coast Club and the Jergens Trust building. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paramount 
</P>
<P>
LIMITS -- As the result of a voter-approved initiative in November, apartment 
and condo complexes are limited to 22 units per acre. The limit previously had 
been 70 units per acre. A public outcry against a building boom, especially 
apartment construction, fueled passage of the measure. 
</P>

WHAT'S ON THE MENU? IN CELEBRITY-CONSCIOUS L.A. IT'S OFTEN A FAMOUS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Tom Lasorda fried mozzarella, escarole and beans, chopped liver or a 
baseball manager? 
</P>
<P>
It depends on whether you're seated in a Beverly Hills diner, an elegant 
Westwood eatery, a Century City deli or the home team dugout at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, a city where celebrity ranks next to godliness, fame is often 
measured by the length of one's limousine. But there is also an emerging 
culinary standard, a sort of adulation by mastication: At restaurants across 
the city, actors, ballplayers and politicians are honored on a variety of 
menus. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, such as the Robin Williams tongue and bologna triple-decker or 
the Sylvester Stallone Italian sausage sandwich, the linkage is obvious. Some 
items are named for stars because they actually frequent the joints and select 
their favorite dish. 
</P>
<P>
Other fare serves as a sign of the times, a barometer of who is hot and who is 
not. Take the spicy shrimp and egg salad, served in a Century City deli. It's 
otherwise known as the Tom Cruise celebrity club combo. 
</P>
<P>
Politics can also play a part in dubbing the cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a Mayor Yorty when we started out. But when Mayor Bradley was elected, 
we put a line through Yorty and stuck in Bradley," said Bill Cullinane, 
co-owner of the Substation near USC. "We eventually rotated Bradley out too. It 
wasn't worth it. Some customers would say: Why Bradley? Why not someone else?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Contradictions 
</P>
<P>
In certain cases, the naming of food items is fraught with contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
For example, how could the egg salad and chopped liver triple-decker at the 
Stage Deli in Century City be called the Cher, when it seemingly contained 
several thousand more calories than the slender screen star noshes in a week? 
The Cher was recently renamed the Bette Midler. 
</P>
<P>
And how could Tom Lasorda be escarole and beans at Matteo's Italian restaurant 
in Westwood but a chopped liver sandwich at the Stage? For that matter, how 
could the skipper of the World Series champions be chopped liver anywhere? 
</P>
<P>
Joe Ramboldt, local manager of the New York-based deli, isn't talking. "I don't 
want to touch that one," he said. "But it certainly is not a reflection on the 
Dodgers' season." 
</P>
<P>
With little question, the bulbous baseball manager, who seems never to have met 
a meal he didn't like, is the city's king of restaurant cuisine. Lasorda's name 
can be found on menus from Venice to South Pasadena (including in his own two 
restaurants, Tommy Lasorda's Ribs and Pasta). 
</P>
<P>
"I'm honored to have such fine dishes named after me," said Lasorda, who often 
speaks in saltier language. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Frank Sinatra and Ronald Reagan are also popular choices 
to eat. 
</P>
<P>
The lame duck President is a baked ham and Swiss cheese triple-decker at the 
Legends of Hollywood delicatessen; a liverwurst and bologna triple-decker at 
the Stage; and a roast beef, ham and American cheese hero at the Substation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people would consider that the deluxe, a top-ender as opposed to the 
bologna sub," Cullinane said. "It had been called the Ralph Nader for a long 
time. But when Ronald Reagan became President, he took over the Nader." 
</P>
<P>
Schwarzeneggers include a turkey, liver and salami triple-decker at Legends of 
Hollywood; a muscle sandwich (No. 518, with avocados, veggies, cheese and 
mushrooms on whole wheat) at Larry Parker's Beverly Hills 24-Hour Diner; and a 
diced ham, shredded Swiss cheese and chopped tomatoes omelet at the Ocean Park 
Omelette Parlor in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
"The omelet was made up by Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1979, and he used to eat 
it," said Tony Casson of the Omelette Parlor chain. "But after we put it on the 
menu, he stopped ordering it. I don't know if he was embarrassed about asking 
for an omelet by his own name." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Casson says, many other body builders wolf down the Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
At C.J. Brett's, a Hermosa Beach sports bar co-owned by Kansas City Royals 
third baseman George Brett, items are named after Wayne Gretzky, Wade Boggs and 
the ubiquitous Tommy Lasorda -- here, it is littleneck clams in a garlic pesto 
sauce over linguine. 
</P>
<P>
Yet at Stats sports bar in Culver City, sandwiches are named after teams, not 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
"The way they trade players these days," mused chef Don Short, "you'd need to 
make new menus each month. With free agency, you just can't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
At some local hash houses, celebrity status is highly exclusive. Joe's in 
Redondo Beach features only two -- the John Wayne breakfast and the Rudy's 
Special, named after the diner's 15-year busboy. 
</P>
<P>
"The John Wayne, that's it for Hollywood people," declared manager Bob Riddle. 
"Basically, Joe the owner is a big John Wayne fan. He put pictures of John 
Wayne on the walls, he imitates him, he claims he served the John Wayne Special 
to John Wayne. He said John Wayne used to come in here. I don't know if that's 
true or not." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, the John Wayne ($4.50) is a tortilla covered with home fried 
potatoes, topped with two eggs, cheese and Spanish sauce and surrounded by 
sausages. 
</P>
<P>
At Mort's Palisades Delicatessen, the sole celebrity sandwich memorializes the 
late comedian Ted Knight, a longtime customer and friend of the management. 
</P>
<P>
"Around here," said Mort's co-owner Bobbie Farberow, "we would ask if they want 
to before we'd name a sandwich. Certain people we have as customers who come in 
with their families would prefer to be a little anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, in the case of sippable consumer products, the use of famous names can 
sometimes turn into a sticky issue. Last October, former child star Shirley 
Temple Black obtained a court order barring Soda Pop Kids, an Encino soft drink 
company, from marketing a cherry-flavored soda with the name "Shirley T." 
</P>
<P>
Most people, though, seem thankful to be memorialized on menus. 
</P>
<P>
At the Stage, Ramboldt said, producer Aaron Spelling personally thanked the 
management. "He said having his name on the menu was the equivalent of winning 
an Emmy." 
</P>
<P>
Dick Clark -- a turkey triple-decker at the Stage -- has no complaints, either. 
"Turkey is good for you, what can I say," Clark said. "I'm honored to be in the 
presence of the Tommy Lasorda chopped liver, but I'm a little disappointed they 
gave the peanut butter and jelly to David Letterman. It was a close race, I'm 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, none of the Hollywood hotshots have yet reached the pinnacle of 
gourmet glory -- a spot reserved for the likes of beef Wellington, oysters 
Rockefeller, or the sandwich itself, named after a British earl.

U.S. OPENS A HIGH-RISE PRISON IN CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rising 10 stories next to the Hollywood Freeway, the sleek, stucco-and-glass 
building looks more like a backdrop for television's "L.A. Law" than a prison 
designed to house some of the most notorious criminal suspects in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Mitnick, the 25-year-old computer genius accused of breaking into 
university and corporate computers from Los Angeles to Leeds, England, now 
calls it home. 
</P>
<P>
So does Barry Minkow, the one-time millionaire whiz kid awaiting sentencing on 
57 counts of fraud stemming from the collapse of his ZZZZ Best Carpet Cleaning 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
So does Marvin McCaleb, the accused Baldwin Hills drug czar suspected of acting 
as supplier for a cocaine organization that had distribution links throughout 
Los Angeles, Detroit, Oakland, St. Louis and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Crimes 
</P>
<P>
And so do about 340 other men facing charges of narcotics trafficking, bank 
robbery, stock swindling and various other crimes that make their way through 
the federal court system in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With the opening in December of the $36-million Metropolitan Detention Center, 
Los Angeles became the fifth major urban area in the country to have a downtown 
federal prison -- and the first in the nation to adopt a prison-wide no-smoking 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
The high-tech, 272,000-square-foot facility, with its balconies, sunny atrium 
and expansive plate-glass windows, does have more the look of a downtown office 
building than a prison. The cells are not cells, they are "rooms," complete 
with bunk beds and wooden doors; the common areas are equipped with microwave 
ovens and hot lines to the public defender's office; there is not an iron bar 
in sight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All Levels of Inmates 
</P>
<P>
But federal Bureau of Prison officials say the Metropolitan Detention Center 
will for the first time provide Southern California with a secure federal 
prison facility designed for all levels of inmates, from the fellow indicted a 
few months ago for beating up his mailman to a Mafia boss. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, federal prisoners awaiting trial and sentencing were kept 25 miles 
south of the Civic Center at Terminal Island, which was designed to house only 
medium-security prisoners who had already been sentenced. The Terminal Island 
prison has been plagued in recent months with a rash of escapes and attempted 
escapes among the higher-security inmates it was forced to accommodate. 
</P>
<P>
The new detention center at 535 N. Alameda St. will allow prisoners whose 
trials are pending to be housed just two blocks from the U.S. District 
Courthouse, ending the time-consuming process of transporting them back and 
forth down the Harbor Freeway each day court is in session. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just so many aspects to having this facility open. It really is like 
having a grand Christmas present, a blessing from heaven," Chief Deputy U.S. 
Marshal David Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Marshal's Service estimates that it will save at least $200,000 a year 
by not having to transport the usual 250 to 300 prisoners a week from Terminal 
Island. The federal public defender's office figures it will save $18,000 a 
year in telephone bills alone, because it will no longer have to rely on 
clients calling person-to-person collect from Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
Terminal Island, which has been filled to nearly double its capacity since it 
began housing pretrial and convicted but not-yet-sentenced prisoners in 1981, 
will be able to lower its total inmate levels somewhat and house more prisoners 
of the kind it was designed for: medium-security inmates serving out their 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
"What this means is, we will be able to return to really what the institution 
is designed for," said Jim Zangs, executive assistant to the warden. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Detention Center debut has not gone without a hitch. In the 
days immediately after its Dec. 14 opening, defense attorneys complained about 
having to wait hours at a stretch to visit clients. 
</P>
<P>
"Right before it opened, we were all going around saying how wonderful it was 
going to be having the MDC (Metropolitan Detention Center) right over here," 
said Yolanda M. Barrera, chief deputy federal public defender. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have had problems since it opened with regards to the waiting. Last 
week, I waited 2 1/2 hours and still didn't see anyone, and finally gave up and 
left," Barrera said. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are problems that any institution is going to have in the initial 
stages of operation." 
</P>
<P>
More controversial has been the center's no-smoking policy, the first total 
smoking ban for inmates and staff adopted at any federal prison in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In the facility's first few weeks, one inmate reportedly tore up his cell and 
two others were involved in protests that some prison officials attribute at 
least partly to frustration over the smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
One inmate who had been smoking four or five packs a day obtained a court order 
to return to Terminal Island. Another initially asked for a court order but 
then decided to stay at the center "because the food's really good," Barrera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"One or two had been smoking their whole lives. It was like the last pleasure 
they had. And to take that away meant they had nothing left," Deputy Federal 
Public Defender Kerry Bensinger said. 
</P>
<P>
But some inmates, he added, have said they look forward to breaking the smoking 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
Warden Margaret Hambrick said she decided on the no-smoking policy because of 
the high-rise design and closed-climate air recirculation system that could 
expose nonsmokers to secondary smoke. Two state prisons in Washington and Utah 
have adopted similar policies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about side-stream smoke and its effect on nonsmokers, and the 
long-term health effects that smokers suffer are also very clear in the 
research," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destructive Protests 
</P>
<P>
In response to the destructive protests, prison officials have decided not to 
accept any additional high-security inmates for a short time until facilities 
can be redesigned to accommodate them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are ways to secure rooms where there is very little opportunity for 
destruction, and we're just not equipped for that right now," she said. "We're 
new, the staff is new, the inmates are new, they're all readjusting to a 
different structure." 
</P>
<P>
Center officials expect to reach a population of about 500 prisoners over the 
next few months, still substantially short of its full operating capacity of 
1,069. 
</P>
<P>
Within the next few years, the area surrounding the detention center will be 
expanded to include a new 21-story federal office building and a six-story 
Veterans Administration outpatient clinic. Construction of those facilities is 
already under way.

SENIOR SUPERVISOR; 
</P>
<P>
RILEY TO TAKE 4TH TURN AT THE HELM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, the 76-year-old retired Marine Corps officer who is 
still known as "the general" to his colleagues, will be named chairman of the 
Board of Supervisors at its meeting today. He will succeed Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
It will be Riley's fourth turn as chairman, a position that rotates among the 
five supervisors at the beginning of each year. Riley, first appointed to the 
board by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, is the county's senior supervisor, beginning 
his 15th year on the board. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisor from the 5th District, which includes the county's southern 
coastal cities, is known for his cheerful and optimistic demeanor. He calls his 
district the "fabulous 5th," and he describes government employees as members 
of "the Orange County family." 
</P>
<P>
He admits that his optimism is likely to be put to the test by the rough road 
ahead for county government. Starting the year with a $23-million budget 
shortfall and the threat of hundreds of layoffs, officials consider 1989 a 
crucial test for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are going to see frustration turn into goals," Riley said last week 
with his trademark enthusiasm. "I think a lot of the cornerstones have been 
laid, and they're ready to burst out. Orange County deserves the best because 
it is the best." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult Period 
</P>
<P>
The issues in 1989 are all new and more complex than they were 15 years ago, 
Riley said. But he is happy about his opportunity to once again lead the board. 
</P>
<P>
Riley recently survived one of the more difficult periods in his career as a 
supervisor when backers of the countywide slow-growth initiative that failed on 
the June ballot targeted him for recall. They said he was under the control of 
the county's developers, and they particularly criticized a development he 
steered through the board in Laguna Canyon that is to include 3,200 homes and a 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"His commitment to major land developers in Orange County has left his 5th 
District unrepresented," said Thomas C. Rogers, a leading force in the county's 
slow-growth movement. "He is the architect of the destruction of the quality of 
life and open spaces in his district." 
</P>
<P>
Rogers, a former Republican Central Committee chairman who once ran against 
Riley, said he doubted whether anything will change when Riley assumes the 
leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Riley) can't do a lot more harm than he has already done," Rogers said. 
"But I'm sure he'll surprise me again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2 Special Projects 
</P>
<P>
The criticisms of Riley are not new. He once told a reporter shortly after he 
was appointed to the board that he thinks some people are too preoccupied with 
environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
But Riley also notes that he has helped make 24,000 acres of public land in the 
county available for open space and parks. And he boasted of the millions of 
dollars in private funds that he has secured for new roads in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his years on the board, Riley has had two special projects that he 
has considered among his most important duties. 
</P>
<P>
One is construction of the San Joaquin Hills Corridor, a highway that would 
connect California 73 to Interstate 5 near Avery Parkway. The other is the 
expansion of John Wayne Airport, which was named after the late actor, a Riley 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
Riley, who was a brigadier general when he retired from the Marine Corps after 
30 years, said in 1987 that if those two projects were on their way to 
completion by 1990, he might not seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
Riley has been hospitalized in recent years with bouts of asthma, but last week 
he said he feels good and the decision about his next term "is still a year 
away." 
</P>
<P>
"If I feel as enthusiastic next year as I do now, I'll go again," he said.

SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to your editorial "No Time To Tinker," Dec. 13: 
</P>
<P>
As a member of Congress who voted against the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage 
Act, I strongly disagree with your recent editorial endorsing this new law. 
</P>
<P>
The name of this law is a misnomer, because it implies protection from the 
financial devastation that a major, long-term illness can cause. The only true 
catastrophic benefit provided by the new law is for long-term hospitalization; 
it provides no coverage whatsoever for lengthy nursing home or home health 
care, the types of care that are much more frequently needed for people with 
long-term disabilities or illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The other principal benefits provided by the law are help with physicians' fees 
and prescription drug expenses. Large bills in both of these areas can cause 
hardship, but rarely are the costs "catastrophic." Yet, $2,000 worth of 
doctors' bills in a year is a modest expense compared to $30,000 for a yearlong 
stay in a typical nursing home, which really is catastrophic for all but the 
most affluent elderly. 
</P>
<P>
To pay for these minor additional benefits, Medicare recipients are going to 
pay large fees. All recipients (except the very poor) will pay a premium of 
about $10.20 a month five years from now, when the new benefits are fully 
phased in, in addition to their basic Medicare premium. The 40% of the elderly 
who pay income taxes will also pay a surtax, with the wealthiest paying as much 
as $1,050 by 1993. Most of the higher-income elderly who have complained to me 
about the surtax say that they wouldn't object if it was for benefits they 
really wanted, but they feel (justifiably so) that it's too much for anyone to 
pay for the relatively unimportant coverage the new law provides. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem with the new law is that it will make it much more 
difficult for Congress to address the need for help with the costs of long-term 
nursing home and home health care. Because of the great expenses involved in 
these two types of care, it will be nearly impossible to create a federal 
program to pay for them without asking beneficiaries to bear part of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
This dilemma could freeze action in Congress on long-term care for years to 
come, which is why your conclusion that this "is not the time to tinker with" 
the new law is absolutely wrong. Congress needs to scrap it as soon as possible 
and start over. If we provide, instead, long-term care benefits -- the 
catastrophic coverage that the elderly need and want the most (and probably 
thought they were getting with this bill) -- we're certain to see a much 
greater willingness on their part to pay for them.

No one wants to raise taxes except the bureaucrats. And we don't need to raise 
taxes to reduce the national deficit. Only reduce spending. 
</P>
<P>
Now we have almost 2 million service people and their families stationed 
outside the U.S. Besides their pay, it costs about $50,000 per person per year 
to support them with our tax dollars. Money is needed for housing, 
transportation, food, education, medical care, etc. Just cut that number by 
one-half or 1 million and it would result in a huge deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
We protect many countries around the world with these service personnel. We 
provide military protection while they are investing in education and research 
and development, including high-tech machines. So bill these countries for the 
costs of the service people we have stationed there to protect them. See how 
fast our national deficit is eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
And we support, in many countries around the world, giveaway programs with 
billions of our tax dollars each year. Eliminate them and we would have a huge 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
That would pay for a national health care program, housing the homeless, better 
education for our youth and training programs for the unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989 we senior citizens who pay federal income tax will now pay a Medicare 
surtax. That is in addition to the annual Medicare program increase and the 
added charges for the catastrophic health care program. 
</P>
<P>
We seniors had no voice in the Medicare surtax nor the option of choice for 
catastrophic health care. Neither do we have any chance of stopping Congress 
and the top executives from receiving their big fat pay raises. No wonder 99% 
are always re-elected. Their pay and fringe benefits are fantastic for the work 
they don't do on our behalf!

TOWER APPOINTED TO DEFENSE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The appointment of Tower as secretary of defense has brought to my mind an 
interesting situation. Tower was appointed by President Reagan to investigate 
his and Vice President Bush's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. Tower 
exonerated both of them, saying that while Reagan may have been asleep at the 
wheel he was not guilty of knowing of, or being involved in, the trade of arms 
for hostages and the subsequent use of money from the sales of the arms to fund 
the Contras in their battle with the Sandinistas. 
</P>
<P>
Tower also concluded that Bush was not involved in either the swap part of the 
deal, or the transfer of funds part. How strange it is that this man, the 
investigator, should then be given such a powerful and influential position in 
the new government of the man he recently investigated, and cleared. And even 
stranger is the silence about this transaction in the news media. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all I find it hard to understand the silence of the leaders of the 
Democratic Party. When one has a government which feels itself above the law we 
must have an opposition party to watch over the administration of justice, and 
to protect the interests of the people. We have, for too long, left this 
function to the press. Today, however, the news media function more as an 
advertising medium.

Conine states that it would not be unfair to expect Social Security recipients 
to shoulder their share of cutting the deficit. He forgets one thing. Social 
Security recipients, by and large, live on a fixed income. Any new burden 
cannot be shouldered without extreme hardship. 
</P>
<P>
I was a notch-year baby so I do not get my fair share of Social Security. The 
tax reform bill raised my taxes, not lowered them. Now I must pay a lot more 
than I planned on for Medicare, $31.90 per month plus user taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, people like Mr. Conine feel that I must shoulder more taxes. I wish they 
could walk in my shoes for the proverbial mile.

THE YEAR THE WEATHER TURNED IN MOSCOW; 
</P>
<P>
IF THE THAW CONTINUES IN '89, GORBACHEV CAN GO FOR HIGHER STAKES

Oxford University.

<P>
If 1987 was the year in which radical economic reform and serious political 
reform were put onto the agenda in the Soviet Union more firmly than ever 
before, 1988 was the year in which Mikhail S. Gorbachev was to discover just 
how difficult a task the politics of reconstructing the Soviet system (or 
perestroika) was going to be. But 1988 was also the time in which those 
attempting to stem the tide of reform were to learn what a skillful and tough 
politician they were up against. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of political difficulties (including serious ethnic tensions and 
popular discontent over stagnating living standards) and a natural disaster 
(the Armenian earthquake), Gorbachev ended the year in a stronger position 
institutionally than he began it. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the removal from the top leadership team of the former Moscow 
party first secretary -- the forthright but impetuous reformer, Boris Yeltsin 
-- in February, Gorbachev's enemies prepared to consolidate the 
counterrevolution. They widely disseminated a neo-Stalinist article by an 
obscure Leningrad lecturer, Nina Andreyeva, which was later rightly described 
as the "manifesto of those conservative forces opposed to perestroika." The 
sharp rebuttal of that document in an anonymous Pravda article (the work of 
Gorbachev's close Politburo ally, Alexander N. Yakovlev) reassured those who 
had begun to fear that the thaw was already over and that the political 
weather, resuming a cycle long familiar in Russian and Soviet history, was 
beginning to freeze once more. 
</P>
<P>
The 19th party conference at the end of June and beginning of July saw a 
further enhancement of Gorbachev's authority. But what really made this meeting 
a remarkable milestone of perestroika was that for the first time in 60 years 
such an authoritative party forum was also the arena of real debate. Gorbachev 
himself was not criticized openly by name (though several of his colleagues in 
the leadership were), but he was the unnamed target in a number of attacks on 
the policies that he had already espoused. 
</P>
<P>
The conference -- and a Central Committee plenary session a month later, which 
made some of the conference decisions more concrete -- strengthened Gorbachev's 
position by adopting in principle a series of political reforms. They 
authorized the creation of a new-style presidency (destined to have Gorbachev 
as its first occupant) and something rather more like a parliament than the 
Soviet Union has hitherto known. 
</P>
<P>
Within the last three months reform has been taken further. In his travels 
throughout the Soviet Union in September, Gorbachev was taken aback by the 
often skeptical and sometimes hostile reception that he received from those who 
held that perestroika was something happening, perhaps, in Moscow but not much 
in evidence in the more distant parts of the country. This strengthened his 
resolve to press ahead with personnel changes and with a shake-up of the party 
bureaucracy. The changes at the top of the party hierarchy, including the 
compulsory retirement of several of its most conservative figures, strengthened 
the reformist wing of the leadership and enabled Gorbachev to succeed Andrei 
Gromyko as the head of state. 
</P>
<P>
A remarkable streamlining of the party apparatus has also reduced the number of 
departments in the Central Committee building by about 60% and the staff by 
approximately 50% (achieved by retiring or redeploying 60% of the officials and 
making room for a 10% infusion of new blood). Given what most observers of the 
Soviet scene thought they knew about the power of the party bureaucracy to 
protect its interests, that was a rapier thrust by Gorbachev of almost 
staggering incisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Leonid I. Brezhnev, who always played safe and whose highest ambition 
appeared to be to die in office at a ripe old age, Gorbachev is playing for 
higher stakes. He wants not only office but also power -- the power to 
reconstruct the Soviet system. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of that system, in Moscow, Gorbachev has already made an amazing 
amount of progress -- not in turning around the faltering Soviet economy (a 
longer-term task) but in changing the balance of power and influence at the 
center and in making a significant start with political reform. 
</P>
<P>
It is far from Moscow, however, that his most severe tests have come -- in 
Armenia and Azerbaijan and in the Baltic republics. It would be difficult to 
deny that Gorbachev has been the most outstanding world leader of 1988, but, 
though -- in one of his many pragmatic deviations from the political style of 
his predecessors -- he has acknowledged that "politics is the art of the 
possible," there must have been times at which he has wondered whether it is 
not "the art of the impossible." 
</P>
<P>
He knows that perestroika has aroused long-dormant hopes and expectations in 
the minds of many Soviet nationalities. It has produced cross-currents capable 
of engulfing all but a master mariner. If Gorbachev can this year begin to 
channel those currents into movement for constructive change, he will have met 
the toughest of all the challenges now facing him.

STEINBERG CASE ALSO PUTS LIVE TV COVERAGE ON TRIAL

Long before the case went to court, it had provided plenty of fodder for the 
headline writers at the tabloids and had received extensive television coverage 
here: The story of a child's death, family violence and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
So it was not unexpected that all three of New York's network-owned TV stations 
preempted their daytime schedules to air live the courtroom testimony of Hedda 
Nussbaum about beatings by her one-time lover, who is charged in the death of 
their adopted young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The telecasts of her often shocking testimony came at the trial of Joel 
Steinberg, a disbarred lawyer, and proved the most extensive since New York 
State began an 18-month experiment, to end in May, of allowing TV in court. 
</P>
<P>
The Steinberg trial, during which Nussbaum last month spent seven days on the 
witness stand before concluding her testimony, recessed Dec. 21 for the 
holidays. It is to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
The network-owned stations covering it -- WCBS-TV, WNBC-TV and WABC-TV -- 
either have no plans to go live again with it today or have made no decision on 
that yet, station officials say. 
</P>
<P>
But WCBS-TV news director Paul Sagan hopes that what has aired live so far 
helps lead state officials to conclude that TV in the courts is not disruptive, 
as was once feared, and should be allowed on a regular basis, as it now is in 
44 states, including California. (Federal courts still bar TV coverage of their 
cases.) 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been a state, as far as I know, that went backward once they 
started it," Sagan said, referring to trials in which, as is the case in the 
Steinberg trial, still photography and TV cameras are allowed, albeit at the 
discretion of individual judges. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecution in the Steinberg case contends that he struck 6-year-old Lisa, 
in November, 1987, in their Greenwich Village apartment, then failed to summon 
medical help for almost 12 hours, at one point smoking cocaine with Nussbaum as 
Lisa lay comatose on the bathroom floor. According to city officials, Steinberg 
bypassed adoption procedures when he acquired the child from an unwed mother. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged with manslaughter for blows that the prosecution says killed the 
child and with second-degree murder for "depraved indifference" in allegedly 
failing to take action to save her afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Similar charges against Nussbaum, the state's major witness, were dropped on 
grounds she had been too battered by Steinberg to have struck the child or to 
have taken action to save her. 
</P>
<P>
Sagan's station had the most live coverage of Nussbaum's testimony; he said the 
telecasts totaled 21 hours over a six-day period. 
</P>
<P>
WNBC aired the testimony live for four days. WABC said it aired only the first 
two days of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
(Cable Network Network, which previously has aired live coverage of other 
much-publicized court cases, among them the trial of socialite Claus Von Bulow, 
initially didn't air Nussbaum's testimony live. A spokeswoman said that the 
station changed its mind later and aired a total of three hours of her 
testimony Dec. 12 and 13.) 
</P>
<P>
The coverage was on a pooled basis, with only a single TV camera allowed in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Like its local rivals, WCBS lost money -- Sagan had no estimate -- because it 
bumped its usual soap operas, other entertainment programs, and their 
commercials to air Nussbaum's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, two preempted shows were "On Trial" and "People's Court." 
</P>
<P>
Why did WCBS stay live with Nussbaum's testimony so long? 
</P>
<P>
The reason, Sagan replied, was that "it really shed light on a variety of 
things, the broader issues in cases of child abuse, family violence and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We also felt that, having covered her direct testimony, we had to do the 
cross-examination, so we stayed with the full thing." 
</P>
<P>
The ratings and viewer reaction resulting from the live coverage were varied, 
at least at WNBC and WCBS. WABC news director Bill Applegate wasn't available 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Baker, WNBC's news director, said that despite the extensive publicity 
given the Steinberg case and Nussbaum's testimony, his station's ratings for 
its coverage of her testimony didn't change much from what it usually had for 
its daytime entertainment fare. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't seem to me that there was any effect, any higher (ratings) at all," 
he said. But soap opera fans heavily protested the pre-emption of their 
favorite programs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
He had no estimate of how many protesting letters the station got, "but it was 
a fair amount, probably as many as I've gotten on any one issue in the six 
months I've been news director here." 
</P>
<P>
It was a different story at WCBS. Sagan said that for the most part, his 
station's ratings went up during its Nussbaum telecasts: "On most days, I think 
we were double or triple the average for each time period." 
</P>
<P>
And there were few protests by soap opera fans, he added. "I think part of the 
reason is that we provided (soap opera plot) summaries on our noon news that 
week for the people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The summaries -- normally delivered by the editor of "Soap Opera Digest" only 
each Monday as part of a new noon news feature on the station -- included the 
plots of soaps on the rival stations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The kinds of calls we got were on the days the (court) sessions started late," 
Sagan said. "We got lots of calls from people saying 'Where's the trial? Why 
hasn't it started?' " 
</P>
<P>
New York's 18-month experiment with TV in its courts will end May 31. Then a 
committee will prepare a report on the test for Gov. Mario Cuomo, state chief 
judge Sol Wachtler, and the state legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation would be needed to make TV in the New York courts -- when presiding 
judges allow it -- a permanent thing. 
</P>
<P>
WNBC's Baker hopes that will happen, but cautions that the judicial jury is 
still out on that: 
</P>
<P>
"I think as it (televised court coverage) has proceeded through the year, 
judges have come to feel more comfortable with it," he said. "Many of their 
reservations about it haven't come to pass . . . the disruptions, people 
playing to the cameras, haven't in fact happened. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's always the possibility they'll decide at the end of the experiment 
that it's enough" and once again bar TV from the courtroom, he said.

BETTE DAVIS SMOKING OVER 'STEPMOTHER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NINA J. EASTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Friday night last spring, Hollywood legend Bette Davis left the Los Angeles 
film set of "Wicked Stepmother" after one week of shooting to undergo some 
dental work in New York. She never returned. 
</P>
<P>
Now, eight months later, the true story behind that departure is the source of 
a heated dispute between the 80-year-old Davis and "Wicked Stepmother's" 
41-year-old director, Larry Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen says Davis did not return because of her health, particularly the severe 
weight loss she experienced after dental surgery. But the relentlessly feisty 
Davis blames Cohen for her decision not to return. She sharply criticizes his 
directorial style and says he refused to heed any of her advice. 
</P>
<P>
With "Wicked Stepmother" tentatively set to open Jan. 27, Davis is anxious to 
distance herself from the film -- even though audiences will see her starring 
in scenes during the first half-hour. "I would be ashamed to have people think 
I sanctioned something like this," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has not seen the completed film, but she did view the first week's 
footage before she left for New York. "People will be horrified at the footage 
on me," she says. "I think that for the good of my future career I honestly had 
no choice" but to go public with the story. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an acting career already spanning more than half a century, Davis' 
"future career" is much on her mind these days. In 1983, after undergoing a 
mastectomy, followed nine days later by a stroke, Davis was terrified that she 
would never again be able to act. She wrote in her book "This 'n That" that, "I 
wouldn't want to live if I could never act again." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Davis is back on her feet, with a chatty autobiographical book and a 
starring role in the feature film "Whales of August" behind her. During a 
recent interview in her Hollywood apartment, she looked resplendent and elegant 
in her tailored red-knit dress and diamond-laced jewelry. But as Davis settled 
into her armchair, reaching for her trademark prop -- a cigarette -- it was 
obvious that while she has recovered from the stroke, she will never recover 
from her intense need to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I lah-h-h-v my profession," says the ever-so-theatrical voice, deepened by 
years of tobacco smoke. "I would n-e-e-e-ver stop. Relax? I relax when I work. 
It's my life." 
</P>
<P>
That need to go on acting, regardless of her age, is what prompted Davis to go 
public with her side of the "Wicked Stepmother" story -- and to voice her 
criticism of Cohen's direction. "I'm not a vain person," says Davis. "But at 80 
years old I don't want to look the way I looked (in the "Wicked Stepmother" 
footage). It seriously could be the end of anybody ever hiring me again." 
</P>
<P>
There is also an unspoken concern here: Studios are reluctant to hire actors, 
particularly older actors, with publicized health problems. A key reason is the 
steep price of obtaining cast insurance, which covers a studio's losses if an 
actor dies or falls ill during production. In Davis' case, according to Cohen, 
the insurance company paid out a $1-million claim to cover the costs of her 
departure from "Wicked Stepmother." 
</P>
<P>
But, as Cohen notes, Davis' dental problems should not make her any less 
employable because they weren't related to her age or health. "This could have 
happened to anybody," Cohen says. He adds that Davis passed the physical that 
is required before obtaining cast insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen -- who launched his own career writing such films as "Carrie," and has 
made his mark as a director of horror offerings like "Q," "The Stuff," and the 
"It's Alive" series -- wrote the "Wicked Stepmother" role specifically for 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls the story of Davis' departure this way: Soon after the actress flew 
to New York last spring, it became clear that her dental problems were more 
serious than anyone had anticipated. She stayed in New York several weeks, 
undergoing surgery and experiencing severe weight loss. (Davis herself says she 
dropped from 88 to 75 pounds.) 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, her business manager contacted Cohen and began raising 
objections to several aspects of the production. "Her manager came out and said 
there were problems with the set," says Cohen. "She had fallen on something. . 
. . (At another point) a special effect cigarette prop had exploded and hurt 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen contends that Davis' representatives were paving the way for her decision 
not to return for the two more weeks of filming required in the original 
script. By then, he says, he had received a letter from her doctor saying she 
was unable to return anytime soon. As production stalled and costs escalated, 
Cohen says he considered hiring a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he rewrote the script to minimize Davis' role as the wicked witch who 
marries into an unsuspecting family, becoming the children's stepmother. In the 
original script, Davis was going to turn a cat into the beautiful Barbara 
Carrera. In the new version, Davis herself turns into Carrera, who assumes 
Davis' lines for the bulk of the film. (Though some family members continue to 
see her as Davis.) 
</P>
<P>
Davis sees things differently. Yes, she says, she did undergo intensive dental 
work, including surgery, and lost 13 pounds as a result. "But I was perfectly 
able, had the conditions been right, to return to the film. Perfectly able," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Those "conditions," she says, centered on Cohen's direction, and his attitude. 
"Before I left, I told him I had to see the rushes (that is, the film footage) 
from the week's work," Davis recalls. "I've always tried to be very, very 
honest with audiences. Whatever I did, I believed in myself. I was really very 
upset with these rushes. Many of the scenes that I wasn't in had nothing to do 
with the script I had approved. Much of that week's work had, well, to me, many 
vulgar moments. 
</P>
<P>
"He never rehearses actors," she complains of Cohen. "He just rehearses the 
camera. So we work for the camera. I was very uncomfortable in all the scenes 
he had me play in that week because he worried about the camera. There was 
always a dolly running around." 
</P>
<P>
Davis was particularly disturbed about her own appearance on film. "If he had 
gone in and seen the rushes daily he would have seen that there was a problem 
dentally, but he never does," she says. "On the screen I looked uncomfortable 
-- and I was." 
</P>
<P>
She says that after many days in New York agonizing over what to do, she 
concluded that she had to leave the production. "I just knew I could not come 
back," she says, "that nothing would change. He took suggestions from nobody." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen dismisses Davis' criticisms. On the quality of the Davis' footage, he 
says that no one but Davis could tell that her dentures were slipping. He adds 
that in the final cut he edited out the pauses she took between lines -- 
apparently a result of her dental problems. 
</P>
<P>
He says that while he doesn't block out scenes on location -- preferring to 
work more spontaneously -- he spent days rehearsing lines with her personally 
and with the cast at his home. "And I have plenty of cigarette burns all over 
my house to prove it," Cohen said in a reference to Davis' smoking habit. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the dispute over one scene: "Vulgar, in terrible taste," says 
Davis. "One of the biggest laughs in the movie," retorts Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
In it, the audience gets a glimpse of a photo of the family's natural mother on 
the mantel, as the children recount how wonderful and kind she was. The photo 
is of Joan Crawford, subject of her daughter's scathing book, "Mommie Dearest," 
and Davis' "Baby Jane" co-star. (Davis received similar treatment from her 
evangelical daughter, B.D. Hyman, who condemned the actress' mothering talents 
in a 1985 book.) 
</P>
<P>
The strong-willed Bette Davis is no rookie in the ring with film makers and 
studios. There was the time in 1945, for example, when she "raised H" -- as she 
puts it -- over an advertisement for "Corn is Green" that pictured her 
schoolmistress character, Miss Moffat, in a slinky gown. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' fights with Jack Warner were legendary. Angry over the uninteresting 
parts his studio was requiring her to play during the 1940s, she fled to Europe 
to make pictures. But Warner filed a suit against her for breach of contract 
and obtained an injunction against her non-Warner work. 
</P>
<P>
But, Davis says, she has never before left a film in the midst of production. 
"I thought this part would be fun," she says. "In all my years, I never heard 
of a director who never saw rushes, who never listened to me. I was always 
flattered by directors. I think you have a duty to bring ideas to them -- 
that's the way I've always worked." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen insists that his and Davis' relations were amicable right up to her 
departure to New York, when she said goodby to him with a kiss. "My attitude is 
that many people give Bette Davis dinners, many people give Bette Davis awards, 
but very few give her jobs," says Cohen. "I gave her a job." 
</P>
<P>
Cohen still considers Davis "wonderful woman, very brave and courageous. I'm 
sorry it worked out to be an unfortunate experience." Of her decision to go 
public with her story, he says, "She's a fighter, that's why she's been around 
so long. Now she's fighting for her next film."

THEATER AND FILM / MARK CHALON SMITH: PERSONAL WORKS, 'BIG STARS' ON THE BILL; 
</P>
<P>
SCR OFFERS 'ROAD TO MECCA'; CENTER WILL STAGE 'FIDDLER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Any discussion about the coming year in Orange County theater is obliged to 
give the customary nod to South Coast Repertory, that rarely swaying monolith 
on the local stage scene. 
</P>
<P>
SCR is the best because it's not nervous about experimenting with new plays or 
toying creatively with revivals. SCR is the best because it works with new 
writers and offers a supportive forum for their work. SCR is the best because 
it won a Tony last year. SCR is also the best, at least around these parts, 
because it doesn't have much competition. 
</P>
<P>
Not that everything has been completely rosy at the repertory where rarely is 
heard a discouraging word. Respected young playwright Ellen McLaughlin, 
obviously aching over the cancellation of her complex play "Infinity's House," 
recently cast some aspersions on the theater's reputed commitment to writers. 
We'll see whether the whole incident will have any impact this year or in 
future seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Now, back to the nice stuff. Yes, SCR is the best in Orange County, by a long 
stroke, and one of the best on the West Coast, if not the country. Last year's 
record -- with a handful of acclaimed productions including "The Crucible" and 
"The School for Scandal" -- will be tough to match in 1989, but the potential 
is there. 
</P>
<P>
SCR begins the year with Athol Fugard's "The Road to Mecca" on the Mainstage 
beginning Jan. 13, directed by Martin Benson and featuring Nan Martin. 
Considered one of the most important voices to come out of the racial and 
political unrest of South Africa, Fugard is best known for exposing the pain of 
apartheid in many of his dramas, including the moving "Master Harold . . . and 
the Boys" and the bleak "Boesman and Lena." 
</P>
<P>
But Fugard has also written personal pieces designed more to examine the role 
of the artist in a world complicated by moral and spiritual questions, and 
society's too frequent disdain for the artist's commitment. "The Road to 
Mecca," which focuses on the relationship between an elderly sculptor, her 
cleric friend and a young radical woman, is such a work. Coming March 3 is a 
revival of George Bernard Shaw's "You Never Can Tell." Beginning June 9, 
audiences will get to see SCR handle the Broadway hit "Sunday in the Park With 
George," Stephen Sondheim's 1985 Pulitzer Prize-winning musical based on the 
life of pointillist artist Georges Seurat. 
</P>
<P>
On the smaller, more intimate Second Stage, one of Lanford Wilson's most 
memorable characters will be spotlighted in his comic romance, "Talley's Folly" 
beginning Jan. 27. In this earlier work, Wilson, a writer known for his 
intriguing people and often wonderfully disheveled plays, introduces us to 
Sally Talley before she's grown into the more mature and cynical woman who 
strides through his "Fifth of July." Also worth noting will be Stephen 
Jeffries' adaptation of Charles Dickens' "Hard Times," opening March 17 on the 
Second Stage. 
</P>
<P>
A short walk from SCR lies the visual grandeur and middle-of-the-road 
sensibilities of the Orange County Performing Arts Center. If the Center is the 
most obvious manifestation of a dream to bring culture to the region, then it's 
a fitful dream at best, at least from a stage perspective. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Center, for the most part, brought in traveling shows of veteran 
hits -- "South Pacific," "Cats," "Me and My Girl," etc. Some were pretty good, 
others seemed tired, marked by cart-and-carry production values and routine 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Like last year, the Center leans toward the tried-and-true in 1989, this time 
featuring more "big stars" than ever. Topol is scheduled to reprise his 
starring role in "Fiddler on the Roof" (dates to be announced), and Leslie 
Uggams is slated for Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" (Sept. 19-24). 
</P>
<P>
Probably the most anticipated show will be a traveling production of Sondheim's 
1988 Tony Award-winner, "Into the Woods," scheduled to open March 7. Elvis 
(actually, three actor versions of the king) will materialize when the Center 
offers "Elvis: A Musical Celebration" (May 30 to June 4). 
</P>
<P>
Despite financial threats to its Shakespeare Festival, the Grove Theatre 
Company in Garden Grove made some strides last year, especially with its strong 
Shakespeare productions. The festival will revisit in summer. Until then, there 
are regular season shows worth watching for, including the Jan. 20 opening of 
"Lily Dale," Horton Foote's tale of a family reunited and the changing societal 
values in 1909 America, and Rod Serling's "Requiem for a Heavyweight," 
scheduled for March 17. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest event for the Grove may have nothing to do with an individual 
production -- 1989 should bring some clarity to the troupe's ambitious plan to 
further raise itself above the provincial by becoming a classical repertory 
with touring productions aimed beyond Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
SMALLER AND COMMUNITY THEATERS: With the new year comes the usual advice -- 
just take more chances, especially with show selection. The Garden Grove 
Community Theatre did last year when it produced Albee's "Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?" and the Alternative Repertory Theatre, even though the results 
are mixed, continues to do so. Your audiences crave challenges and intelligent 
surprises -- trust me. 
</P>
<P>
Some interesting choices for the new year: 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Playhouse, the region's top community theater, stages "I'm Not 
Rappaport" (Jan. 19 to Feb. 12) and a new musical based on the life of French 
Impressionist painter Edouard Manet (May 18-June 11). Santa Ana's Alternative 
Repertory Theatre offers Jean Cocteau's "An Eagle With Two Heads" beginning 
Feb. 10. The La Habra Depot Playhouse produces "The Glass Menagerie" (April 
7-29). 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Black Actors Theatre presents the musical "Raisin" (July 7 to 
Aug. 13). The Buena Park Civic Theatre stages "The Mystery of Edwin Drood" 
(dates to be announced). The Cypress Civic Theatre has scheduled "Chekhov in 
Yalta" (Jan. 12-28) and "Bleacher Bums" (May 11-12). The Huntington Beach 
Playhouse presents "Of Mice and Men" (March 3 to April 1). 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: Kudos to all the theater departments that leaned toward risk-taking 
last year. The casts may not always be the most experienced, but the production 
values are usually strong and the show choices are sometimes remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary, incomplete schedules for 1989 aren't as intriguing as in 1988, 
but here are a few that may be a little different: 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton offers Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan" (March 3-12). 
Fullerton College stages "Tracers" (May 4-14). Orange Coast College presents 
"Inherit the Wind" (May 4-14). UC Irvine offers "King Lear" (Jan. 26 to Feb. 4) 
and "Cloud Nine" (March 9-18).

BYRDS FLOCK TO SAN JUAN FOR FUN, BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week's Byrds reunion featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris 
Hillman will bring back an important '60s rock legacy of chiming guitars, 
swelling harmonies and such landmark songs as "Eight Miles High" and "Mr. 
Tambourine Man." 
</P>
<P>
But there is an unusual subtext for this first official flocking under the 
Byrds' banner since 1973 -- one that calls to mind a less sacrosanct '60s song 
title: "The Name Game." 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman have decided to take the name "The Byrds" in hand 
so they won't have to worry about two other former Byrds usurping it to beat 
around rock's bush leagues. The three Southland club dates they have booked 
this week are part of a legal process by which McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman aim 
to secure "The Byrds" as a registered trademark that only they can use. 
</P>
<P>
The dates don't signal any ongoing reformation of the Byrds, says McGuinn, the 
mainstay of the band from its inception in 1964 to its demise, after many 
lineup changes, in 1973. The purpose of the hastily arranged reunion is to have 
fun with the old songs, he said in a phone interview from his home in Florida 
-- and to do a bit of business as the Byrds in order to meet legal requirements 
for registering a trademark. McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman will appear as the 
Byrds on Wednesday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, Thursday at the 
Bacchanal in San Diego and Friday at the Ventura Terrace Theater. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn, 46, said the impetus for the shows came when Crosby heard that a 
promoter in Florida was booking a tour for "The Byrds" that included only one 
original member, drummer Michael Clarke. It would be the latest in a series of 
Byrds tours over the past few years that have involved Clarke and/or Gene 
Clark, the fifth original Byrd (Crosby's manager, Bill Siddons, said that Clark 
has since agreed not to use the Byrds logo). McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman hope 
to preempt any repeats by securing the band name for themselves as a 
collective. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who wanted to could go out there and operate under the name 'Byrds,' 
and that would be a travesty," the soft-spoken McGuinn said. "So we want to 
nail it down. Our motive is to stop innocent ticket buyers out there from being 
deceived." 
</P>
<P>
Performing again as a Byrd is an about-face for McGuinn. He had been firmly 
against taking part in any reunions under the Byrds logo, which he abandoned 
after the original lineup re-formed for a one-shot album in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when I strictly wanted to have the Byrds in the past," he 
said. But now McGuinn is softening. In June, he joined Crosby and Hillman for a 
15-minute set at a benefit and tribute for the Ash Grove, the seminal Los 
Angeles music club. For that show at the Wiltern Theatre, they were billed 
individually, rather than as the Byrds. McGuinn said all three former Byrds 
enjoyed the reunion and told each other they ought to do to it again sometime. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn also is more amenable to a Byrds regrouping because of Crosby's 
recovery from drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a different person now," McGuinn said. "He's fun to be around and 
fun to work with. He's not like he used to be, and that's a strong incentive." 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn said it was Crosby who persuaded him to stop using the Byrds name 
himself after he had led a series of shifting '70s band lineups in which 
McGuinn was the only link to the group's '60s legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Crosby was upset with me when I was going out and doing it in the early '70s. 
We had a long talk about it, and I decided he was right. And that's why I put 
(the name) to bed." 
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Byrds shows are "not a trial run" for a more permanent arrangement 
or a formal reunion project, McGuinn said. "I think it'd be fun to pursue it 
further, but I'm not sure on what level, or when." If the time comes, he said, 
he would be open to having the two other original Byrds be part of the reunion. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman, after a long career drought, is doing well again as a country rocker 
fronting the Desert Rose Band. Crosby has been keeping a high profile with the 
publication of his autobiography as well as a new album with Crosby, Stills, 
Nash &amp; Young and an upcoming solo album, "Oh Yes I Can," that is due for 
release Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn's recording career has been on hold through most of the '80s but he 
continues to tour as a solo act, focusing mainly on the Byrds repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful thing, a fulfilling thing to do. I don't have any plans to 
get a band together in the near future. I enjoy working solo. I'm doing fine, 
but (a rekindled recording career) will be nice when it happens." 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, McGuinn has been cutting back on his usual 
100-dates-per-year touring regimen to devote time to another project: an 
autobiography that he said is scheduled to be published later this year by E.P. 
Dutton. 
</P>
<P>
With a story that begins in the folk-boom of the early '60s, proceeds through 
the dawning of folk rock and takes detours for a role in Bob Dylan's Rolling 
Thunder Revue and a couple of religious conversions (the first of which led to 
a name change from Jim to Roger), McGuinn should have plenty to recount. And 
who knows -- with the unexpected resurrection and prospective legal 
registration of one of rock's most honored band names, perhaps there will be 
other Byrds chapters to write.

IRISH AND RICE TOO MUCH FOR WEST VIRGINIA, 34-21 
</P>

<P>
Notre Dame's return to glory was accomplished with a minimum of suspense, if 
not fanfare. The Fighting Irish, in winning their first national championship 
in 11 years, so thoroughly dominated West Virginia in Monday's Fiesta Bowl that 
the event lost all drama. The 34-21 victory became, as in the best of times, 
perfunctory. 
</P>
<P>
But if the game lacked drama -- and there was only a moment in the third 
quarter when the third-ranked Mountaineers threatened -- there was still plenty 
of story to Notre Dame's season. 
</P>
<P>
It was just two seasons ago, after all, that the Irish were 5-6 and happy about 
it. They were mediocre, if still talented, and bowl-less seasons had become 
commonplace. They were putting distance, season by season, between them and 
their storied tradition. And now they are 12-0, national champions after 
beating the current No. 2, 3 and 5 teams, and their excellence is again a fact 
of college football. "This is what is good and right in America," said 
All-American tackle Andy Heck, "Notre Dame being No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
For the seniors, and never mind the somewhat longer-suffering loyals, the 
championship was a sweet vindication, a certification of the Notre Dame way. 
The Irish are often high-falutin' and can become insufferable to those who are 
routinely cast as the opponents in their weekly morality plays. But it does 
seem to work out. 
</P>
<P>
"I always believed this would happen," said fifth-year senior Frank Stams, who 
had wallowed through two 5-6 seasons. "Notre Dame breeds winners, and it was 
just a matter of time. Maybe not my time, but somebody's." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, little Lou Holtz hurried destiny on its way, taking hold of this 
program in 1986 and enforcing a discipline that had been lacking at South Bend, 
Ind., during the curious rule of Gerry Faust, a high school coach by profession 
and temperament. Holtz is known as a master of turnarounds, but what he has 
done at Notre Dame is scarcely short of amazing. 
</P>
<P>
The historians can puzzle that out. What happened Monday night between these 
two independents was plain to see. Notre Dame, its pedigree fashioned not so 
much by tradition but by a tough national schedule, ruled West Virginia (11-1) 
on both sides of the line, revealing it to be little more than winner of the 
Eastern draw. The Mountaineers' mountainous offensive line even failed to 
protect its quarterback sufficiently; Major Harris was squashed on the third 
play of the game and was reduced in offensive impact by a bruised left 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the surprise was Tony Rice, Notre Dame's quarterback, a leprechaun of 
sorts, a blithe young spirit in whom Holtz had appeared to invest little 
significance. Of course, Holtz has been known to downgrade his team's chances 
from time to time. But after a week of press conferences, you might have 
thought Rice was positively scatter-armed. "I did tell you he was throwing 
better," said Holtz, defensively. 
</P>
<P>
Rice did throw for 213 yards and 2 touchdowns. His passes over the middle, 
finding halfbacks in that nether area between safety and linebacker, developed 
drives that ended in another touchdown and a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, we can't throw the football," said Holtz, marveling at the way his 
team found to win. 
</P>
<P>
Of course this is something that only the public can be trusted to swallow. 
Heck said: "He never surprises me. He's a born winner. He'll win the game no 
matter what." 
</P>
<P>
Rice, who also rushed for 75 yards in his more customary option duties, 
probably contributes more to this team with his sheer unflappability. On a 
third-and-seven play in the fourth quarter, with the Irish leading, 26-13, the 
junior convened the huddle by saying: "Get your blocks up, boys. I'm going for 
a first down." 
</P>
<P>
He gained 15 yards on a quarterback draw and, on the next play, threw a 57-yard 
pass to Ricky Watters. Two plays after that, he lofted a 3-yard jump pass to 
Frank Jacobs for the final score. And after all this, he maintained his 
humility. Of the matchup, which he won in passing numbers, 213 to 166, he said, 
"Major's still a major; I'm just a private." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, the flashier of the two for sure, was hampered by a shoulder that was 
scrunched by Wes Pritchett on the third play of the game. Although it was not 
his throwing arm, the disability had impact. West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen 
said he would have run "10-12 more option plays, 2-3 more quarterback draws." 
Yet he insisted that wasn't the problem with his Mountaineers. "Notre Dame was 
just better." 
</P>
<P>
That was quickly evident. Holtz said he was worried sick about facing West 
Virginia's offense, a veteran unit that had averaged 43 points a game. If Notre 
Dame got behind, he said, the game might develop into a runaway. So he won the 
toss and let West Virginia take the kick. 
</P>
<P>
This may be his idea of psychology. In any event, West Virginia went 3-and-out 
on its first four possessions. It wasn't until the second quarter that the 
Mountaineers made a first down. And when West Virginia did score, on a 29-yard 
field goal, fully half of the scoring drive had been achieved by Notre Dame 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, which rushed for 242 yards during the game, scored on four of its 
first five drives to take a 23-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia, which had left the field on the positive note of another field 
goal, appeared to return with momentum intact. Midway through the third 
quarter, Harris moved the Mountaineers and uncorked a 17-yard scoring pass to 
Grantis Bell to close to 26-13. 
</P>
<P>
Two plays later, Rice unraveled and threw a terrible pass that was intercepted 
by Willie Edwards and returned to the Irish 26. But on a third-and-12 play, 
with the Mountaineers still in field goal range, Stams and Arnold Ale flew 
through the line and sacked Harris for a 12-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
Almost seven, West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"That was disaster," said Nehlen. "That was the turning point. Had we scored 
then, we'd have had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
Stams said the blitz had been on several times that night but that he had been 
hesitant, fearing the draw or the run. "Then I said, hey, if they're going to 
keep passing, I'm not going to worry about it. I think that play was key. We 
showed them, and proved to ourselves, we could control the game." 
</P>
<P>
The Irish have now controlled most of the top teams this season. They were 
helped by Miami's agonizing missed onversion in a 31-30 victory over the 
Hurricanes, and they more decisively beat USC and now West Virginia. And their 
return to prominence is unarguable. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this a great football team?" asked Holtz. "I have to say, yeah, because 
nobody proved different." This is high praise from Holtz, who has shied from 
such proclamations. "We're now the national championship team," even he had to 
admit. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this is a team for the ages was not for him to say. It was enough that 
Notre Dame had reached its 11th national championship and returned from 
embarrassment, a brief period by all reckonings but Notre Dame's. Notre Dame 
was No. 1 for the moment, and that was all that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
What, somebody asked Holtz, if Notre Dame went into next season ranked No. 1? 
As it surely will, so young is this team. 
</P>
<P>
He laughed. "Oh, my. We've really got some problems on our team," he began. 
</P>
<P>
None, of course, that West Virginia noticed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NO. 1 AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
Since the inception of the Associated Press college football poll in 1936, 
Notre Dame has finished the season as the No. 1 team eight times. (Note -- 
Final 1988 poll will be released today):

MIAMI TRIES HARDER, BUT STILL NO. 2 AFTER DEFEATING NEBRASKA

<P>
The outcome is as certain as a show of hands in the Politburo, but the 
University of Miami tried stuffing college football's ballot box one last time 
Monday night, and the Hurricanes used an obliging Nebraska to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's 23-3 squeeze of the Cornhuskers in the Orange Bowl may have done 
nothing to enhance its national championship aspirations, but it made the No. 2 
Hurricanes early contenders in the running for sore winners of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
If there was another game played for No. 1 Monday, Miami was slow to 
acknowledge it. Notre Dame-West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl? At least one 
Hurricane chose to tune out. 
</P>
<P>
"It was such a boring game," Miami quarterback Steve Walsh said. "I watched 
about a quarter of it." 
</P>
<P>
Not that the Orange Bowl set new standards for excitement, or was worth 
watching for much longer. It was 20-0 at halftime, and only a 50-yard field 
goal by Nebraska kicker Gregg Barrios in the third quarter kept the Cornhuskers 
from being shut out for the first time in 185 games -- since a 27-0 loss to 
Oklahoma in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
This was Nebraska's worst bowl defeat since 1967 -- a 34-7 loss to Alabama -- 
and it was the fewest points ever scored by the Cornhuskers in 27 bowl 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
" More than anything else," Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson said, "that's what we 
wanted to prove tonight and to the country -- that we were the very best. We 
might not be No. 1, but at this time, we are the best football team in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
At another time, back in October, the Hurricanes lost to Notre Dame, 31-30, 
when a 2-point conversion failed. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my team that we probably gave Notre Dame the ranking of No. 1 by not 
kicking the extra point," Johnson said. "We're not normally that generous." 
</P>
<P>
To Nebraska, Miami showed no quarter, especially a Hurricane defense that 
sacked Cornhusker quarterback Steve Taylor 6 times, intercepted 2 Taylor 
passes, held him to minus-2 yards passing in the first half, and 12 yards 
rushing on 17 carries in the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers, remember, entered the game as the nation's No. 1 team in 
rushing offense, averaging 382 yards and more than 5 touchdowns a game. 
</P>
<P>
But not on this surface, where Miami is unbeaten in its last 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
This is how Nebraska's eight possessions went in the first half: punt, punt, 
punt, punt, interception (by Maurice Crum), punt, blocked punt (by Bubba 
McDowell, the 10th of his career), interception (by Rod Carter, fittingly on 
the last play of the half). 
</P>
<P>
"The big thing about Taylor tonight," said Miami defensive end Bill Hawkins, 
who was in on 5 tackles and one of Miami's 6 sacks, "was that on the second 
play of the game he tried to run a sprint around Greg (Mark, the defensive end 
on the other side), and he contained him. After that, we just lowered the boom 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
"He definitely took some hits tonight. I got him a couple of times, Greg sacked 
him twice, and everybody hit him at least a few times. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you. He's a tough kid. After the game, I congratulated him and told 
him he was a tough guy. A lot of guys would have just tried to lay on the 
ground, because we really laid him out." 
</P>
<P>
As relentless as the Miami defense was, there were those -- including Bob 
Trumpy in the NBC broadcast booth -- who suggested that Johnson may have been 
overzealous in proving the unprovable, that the Hurricanes were No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
When Johnson was shown on the sidelines raging at the officials despite a 
20-point lead, Trumpy said that although Johnson was a great guy and all, he 
was leaving some people with the impression that he was "a used-car salesman." 
</P>
<P>
When Walsh's backup, Craig Erickson, was throwing passes into the end zone with 
29 seconds left, Trumpy was even more pointed in his criticism of the Miami 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unhealthy, this is not right, this is not good," Trumpy said. "This 
offends a lot of people, and there's no reason for Jimmy Johnson to offend 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Just guess who was offended when Trumpy's remarks were relayed to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"If they (the Cornhuskers) line up in a blitz, we're going to audible to a 
pass," Johnson bristled, in explaining Erickson's attempted touchdown fling. 
"We're not going to let anyone knock us on our backs, we haven't all year." 
</P>
<P>
As for being characterized as a used-car salesman, Johnson snapped: "We play 
the game with intensity, I coach with intensity. Some people should do their 
jobs as well." 
</P>
<P>
Though Walsh, a junior All-American, was named the game's most valuable player 
and set Orange Bowl records for completions (21) and attempts (44) Monday 
night, he didn't quite do the dazzling job expected. 
</P>
<P>
He had 3 passes intercepted (2 by Nebraska cornerback Charles Fryar), was 
sacked twice and spent most of the night dumping the ball off to his backs. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Leonard Conley caught 2 passes for touchdowns -- one a 22-yarder when 
he was wide open over the middle at the 7-minute mark of the first quarter, the 
other a 42-yarder in which he turned a little flip toss into a sprint down the 
left sideline, abetted by some terrific downfield blocking by Miami's wide 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides catching 4 passes for 94 yards, Conley also rushed 10 times for 40 
yards, keeping Miami's first touchdown drive alive with an 8-yard run on a 
third-and-7 play. Conley, as Walsh readily acknowledged, was at least as 
deserving to be MVP. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a frustrating game," said Walsh, who threw for 277 yards, more than 
double Nebraska's total net yardage. 
</P>
<P>
"We put 23 points on the board, but we really couldn't get any rhythm. They did 
a good job of blitzing and moving guys around. When a team blitzes that much, 
you have to take the short stuff." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't help, either, that Walsh's best receiver, Andre Brown, had been 
suspended a couple of weeks ago for unspecified disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
But as much heat as Nebraska applied on Walsh, it couldn't compare to the 
firestorm faced by Taylor, who finally was lifted by Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne 
after one final, futile scramble in the game's closing moments. 
</P>

"We knew Nebraska has trouble picking up the blitz," Miami defender Hawkins 
said. "We watched film of the Missouri game, and they had trouble with 
Missouri's blitz -- Missouri almost beat them." 
</P>
<P>
And Missouri has nowhere near the speed, the quickness, the depth, the 
coaching, the sheer skill of the Hurricanes, who just may be who they think 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, they're the best football team we've faced this 
season," said Osborne, who sought out Johnson to shake his hand after the game, 
dispelling the suggestion that he would take public offense at the notion that 
Johnson was trying to run up the score. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that Notre Dame will be No. 1," Osborne said, "but I don't think 
there are many teams that would come into the Orange Bowl and be favored to 
beat Miami." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh wasn't planning to stay up and watch any election returns in the future, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
"I sort of assumed Notre Dame was going to win," Walsh said of the Fiesta 
showdown. "We really wanted to go out and show everybody we're the best team in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
"And I fully believe that."

UCLA PICKS APART ARKANSAS AND WINS SEVENTH STRAIGHT BOWL GAME

Troy Aikman was at the crossroads at Texas Stadium Monday, ending a fine 
collegiate career with the kind of passing that made his reputation at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
And, if he is the Dallas Cowboys' No. 1 pick in next April's National Football 
League draft as expected, the quarterback gave hopeful Dallas fans some 
optimisim. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman's third-down efficiency confused Arkansas on two long touchdown drives 
as the ninth-ranked Bruins set an National Collegiate Athletic Assn. record 
with their seventh consecutive bowl victory, beating the Razorbacks, 17-3, in 
the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 12 of 20 third-down opportunities and threw a touchdown pass 
as the Bruins again showed their domination in postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) broke a tie with Georgia Tech, Nebraska, USC and Alabama in 
claiming a spot in the record books with a seventh bowl victory. The Bruins' 
victory streak includes three Rose Bowls, a Fiesta, an Aloha and a Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman overcame an early interception to direct the Bruins on touchdown drives 
of 93 and 74 yards as UCLA gained a 14-0 halftime edge over the Hogs, who had 
only two first downs at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 6 straight third-down plays before Mark Estwick scored on a 
1-yard run for a 6-0 Bruin lead after a scoreless first period. The extra-point 
kick made it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the first half, Aikman took UCLA on a beat-the-clock drive in which he 
fooled Arkansas (10-2) for the second touchdown. On third-and-goal from the 
Hogs' 1, he bootlegged the ball on a fake sweep then threw a touchdown pass to 
tight end Corwin Anthony with 21 seconds left for a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' Kendall Trainor kicked his 24th consecutive field goal, a 49-yarder, 
in the third period to keep the Hogs from a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's only second half points came on Alfredo Velasco's 32-yard field goal in 
the fourth period. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman made excellent use of UCLA's running game, handing off to freshman 
tailback Shawn Wills 18 times for 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was closely watched by members of the downtrodden Cowboys' organization, 
who are thinking about making him the first pick in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas Coach Tom Landry watched on television but scout Gil Brandt was in the 
press box. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman finished his career at UCLA with a 20-4 record as a starter. He hit 19 
of 27 passes for 172 yards. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's alert defense held Arkansas to only four first downs, one by penalty. 
</P>
<P>
The clear, windless day was ideal for UCLA's passing attack. It was the first 
appearance for a West Coast team in the Cotton Bowl since Oregon played 
Southern Methodist 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
A sellout crowd of 74,304 watched Aikman overcome early jitters, failing to see 
Arkansas linebacker LaSalle Harper at the Razorback 12. The interception ended 
a UCLA first-period drive that had reached the Hog 17 after an interception and 
20-yard return by Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's first touchdown drive was helped by a personal foul against Arkansas' 
Otis Lloyd after Aikman had been stopped short on a third-down run. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman then completed a 10-yard pass to Reggie Moore, a 12-yard pass to Mike 
Farr, and a 9-yard pass to Brendan McCracken, all on third down, on the 93-yard 
scoring drive. 
</P>
<P>
The 74-yard scoring drive was aided by Aikman's 20-yard third down pass to Paul 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman converted 8 of 12 third down opportunities in the first half. He also 
completed passes to 10 different receivers as he read the Arkansas defense. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA lost another chance to score in the third period when Laurence Burkley 
fumbled at the Arkansas 7 and Kerry Crawford recovered for the Hogs. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second meeting between the schools. They tied, 10-10, in the 
1978 Fiesta Bowl.

FOR TOURING SOVIET HOCKEY TEAMS, THE TIMES ARE DEFINITELY CHANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>

UNIONDALE, N.Y. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glasnost and familiarity have created considerable change for touring Soviet 
hockey teams and North Americans with whom they come into contact. 
</P>
<P>
During previous visits, players were closely watched by grim-faced "tour 
guides" and media interviews were rigidly conducted with interpreters who 
obviously altered any controversial words. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is possible for a player such as Viacheslav Fetisov to express in a 
40-minute news conference his dissatisfaction with both Coach Viktor Tikhonov 
and the Soviet Defense Ministry, a phenomenon that Fetisov admitted, "If it 
weren't for (Mikhail) Gorbachev, this would be impossible." 
</P>
<P>
The police still are out in force to assure that Soviet players will be 
protected from dissidents who object to their coming here. For Thursday's game 
here, there was a mobile command post, at least two dozen vehicles and half a 
dozen police on horseback. But there were no dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
There were precious few spectators, either, a mere 9,504 in a building that 
seats 16,297. The turnout prompted Islander General Manager Bill Torrey to 
wonder what will happen next year, when the Soviets are scheduled to play all 
three New York-area teams. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a large segment of my customers who don't want this game played," 
Torrey said. "People are telling me, 'We don't want the Russians here.' If we 
don't sell out and the Devils don't sell out, how can we sell three games next 
year?" 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Islanders' veterans, notably Bryan Trottier, who didn't play, and 
Bill Smith, who played under protest, felt the game was unnecessary, Smith 
complaining, "I've got nothing to gain, except maybe getting hurt." 
</P>
<P>
But some of the younger players tried very hard and Patrick Flatley said, "When 
nationalism is at stake, you develop a distaste for other countries. When you 
play against them, you can't help but dislike them. It goes back to the (1984) 
Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
There was a feeling that the Soviets themselves were more interested in a 
shopping visit to Crazy Eddie's than in the game itself. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how well the Central Red Army had played after it edged the Islanders, 
3-2, winger Vladimir Krutov replied through an interpreter, "A victory is a 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if his team was excited about the game, Tikhonov sidestepped, "Our better 
game is ahead. We need time to adapt ourselves to North American playing. The 
time difference is eight hours between Moscow and North America." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, center Igor Larionov, who speaks fluent English, sat and feigned 
laughter as the questions were presented to Tikhonov, winking at a reporter and 
obviously enjoying himself. 
</P>
<P>
After Tikhonov's segment ended, he left the interview room and Krutov and 
Larionov were put on the North American media hot seat. 
</P>
<P>
Larionov, who has been drafted by Vancouver and has made known his desire to 
play in the NHL, said, "It's always important for me to play in North America. 
I like the ambiance, the atmosphere here. I feel the spectators very much like 
hockey in these countries and it's important for both parties to come 
together." 
</P>
<P>
A reporter then asked Larionov about a letter he wrote to the magazine Ogonyok, 
protesting Tikhonov's oppressive training methods as well as his coaching 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Larionov covered his face and said, "Oh, no," but the interpreter obviously was 
unaware of the letter and translated the question for Krutov, who shrugged his 
shoulders. The interpreter then said, "What letter?" and the reporter began a 
recital, while Larionov struggled to keep a straight face. 
</P>
<P>
After discussing the players' enforced absence from their wives, the reporter 
went on to mention a statement that the players often ignored Tikhonov and made 
up their own plays, at which point Larionov shouted in English, "Too much, too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
The mere thought of players criticizing the coach would have been unthinkable 
in the past, when players were reluctant to say more than "Hello" to the 
natives. But Gorbachev obviously has lightened the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Fetisov, in two earlier interviews, accused Tikhonov of placing obstacles in 
his attempt to join the New Jersey Devils. Tikhonov, who recently passed the 
captain's "K" from Fetisov to Sergei Makarov, insisted he had approved 
Fetisov's release in May, "but there are other top-level officials," an 
apparent reference to Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov. 
</P>
<P>
However, Fetisov, a major in the Red Army, said, "If Tikhonov wanted it, I 
think this thing would be resolved quickly. He's all talk and no action." 
</P>
<P>
That statement was made through a translator. In English, Fetisov said of 
Tikhonov, "He's an actor, a very good actor." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the atmosphere, the Soviets' game appears to have changed, too. Instead 
of passing the puck patiently until they set up a good shot, as they once did 
with such grace, they are following the typical NHL practice of shooting from 
all angles. Against the Islanders, the Soviets put 37 shots on goal and fired 
countless others wide. But they were low-quality shots; all three goals came on 
breakaways. 
</P>
<P>
For each of the 14 games being played here by the Army and Dynamo Riga, the 
Soviets are guaranteed a fixed amount, believed to be $25,000. They also 
receive a percentage of the gate, expenses and a full set of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the Army appeared in its opening match at Quebec in spiffy red 
helmets and sweaters. However, the players wore blue pants borrowed from the 
Nordiques, because their new red ones had been shipped inadvertently to Moscow. 
Also, the sweaters lacked names on the back, because the manufacturer 
mistakenly put the Army players' names on the Dynamo sweaters. The mistakes 
were rectified for the game here. 
</P>
<P>
If some fans are indifferent, it would appear nonetheless that matches against 
the Soviets will increase and a lot of people on both sides think it is a good 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Al Arbour of the Islanders said, "It's a good experience for a great 
number of our players. We can learn from them and they can learn from us. Their 
skating and headmanning the puck are things we've got to do." 
</P>
<P>
Krutov said, "Any games with North American teams are prestigious. It's very 
good for our hockey future to play them." 
</P>
<P>
Now if Fetisov and Larionov could only figure out their hockey future.

MORNING BRIEFING: ONE PLAY GAVE NEW YORK 2 HITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An event that led to sports and theater history took place 69 years ago today. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 3, 1920, Harry Frazee, owner of the Boston Red Sox, sold 
pitcher-outfielder Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees for $125,000 plus a 
$350,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that Ruth became the most legendary baseball player of all-time 
and turned the Yankees into the game's most successful franchise. 
</P>
<P>
What a lot of people don't know is that Frazee used the loan to turn the play 
"No, No, Nanette" into a hit on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
There has been plenty written and said about several Soviet hockey and 
basketball stars coming to play in the United States and Canada, but according 
to James H. Jackson of the Baltimore Sun, defenseman Kevin Lowe of the Edmonton 
Oilers wouldn't mind playing in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be one heck of an experience to be the first athlete from North 
America to play over there," Lowe said. "It's not a gimmick. I'd like to go out 
of curiosity of their politics, their society, their life style. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard people say I'm crazy. I think it would be an 8-to-10 month 
commitment out of my life, but I've made a lot of commitments to the game to be 
the best player I possibly could be. I wouldn't want to be at the end of my 
career when I did it. I'd want to be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The Miami Heat lost the first 17 games of its first season before beating the 
Clippers, but things began looking up last week when it won two straight. 
</P>
<P>
Said forward Pat Cummings: "We started to walk with our first two wins -- now 
we're starting to ride our bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
Add Heat: During the exhibition season, Miami forward Scott Hastings said to a 
trainer for his former team, the Atlanta Hawks: "I'm scared. I think I'm the 
best player here." 
</P>
<P>
Hastings was slightly off. He's last on the Heat with a 3.8-scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
Last add Heat: Despite the team's nickname and locale, the Heat is cold. No 
Miami player is shooting 50% from the field and the team average is 43.3%. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Walsh of the San Francisco 49ers called one of the National Football 
League's rarely used plays when he had Mike Cofer try a free kick on the last 
play of the first half in Sunday's 34-9 playoff victory over the Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
The kick was set up when Walsh had John Taylor call for a fair catch at 
midfield on a Minnesota punt. Cofer then missed badly on a field-goal attempt 
from there. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted as a coach to try that," Walsh told reporters with a smile. 
"It was sort of fun -- until we kicked it and then everybody ran in." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears, responding when asked if his next heart 
attack might come on the sidelines: "I'm going to make it. And if I don't then 
I'll tell you what, it's going to be earth-shattering, with the coach dying on 
the sideline."

ROSE BOWL NOTES;

WIN MAKES RETIRING DUKE FEEL LIKE A KING

<P>
Wayne Duke, retiring commissioner of the Big Ten Conference, was brought to 
tears in the press box by Michigan's 22-14 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
As commissioner for the last 18 years, Duke has been an easy target for those 
who have criticized the Big Ten's recent lack of success in the Rose Bowl. But 
now his conference has won its last two Rose Bowls, Michigan State beating USC 
last year, and Duke couldn't have received a better retirement present. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people are shaking my hand," Duke said, "but you know what, I didn't 
throw one block or make one tackle." 
</P>
<P>
In the category of outdated jokes, there's this one that was making the rounds 
before the game: Why does Bo Schembechler eat his cereal off a plate? Because 
if he put it in a bowl, he'd lose it. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Shav Glick, 68, who helped cover Monday's Rose Bowl, saw his 
first Rose Bowl game 57 years ago, when USC beat Tulane in 1932. After that 
game, Glick saw 20 of the next 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan defensive tackle Mark Messner's thoughts on playing against USC's 
Aaron Emanuel: "I didn't like it much. I hit him square on one time, and the 
next thing I know, he was 4 yards downfield." 
</P>
<P>
Messner said he missed Leroy Hoard's 61-yard breakaway run for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all huddled around Coach Carr," Messner said, referring to Lloyd Carr, 
the defensive coordinator. "We're supposed to be concentrating on our huddle, 
so if we even stand up he gets a little mad. We heard the crowd go crazy, but 
nobody moved. We didn't get to see it at all." 
</P>
<P>
Messner's impression of playing against USC's John Guerrero, a 320-pound 
tackle: "They passed so much that it was hard to get a good idea of just how 
good he is. But he certainly is classy. He'd help you up, tell you you made a 
good play. 
</P>
<P>
"Matter of fact, the entire USC team was classy. Some teams, you are out there 
and there is lots of talking and bad-mouthing. There was none of that with 
USC." 
</P>
<P>
When Rodney Peete turned a broken play into a 23-yard gain in the second 
quarter, it was the Trojan quarterback's longest run of the season -- by a 
yard. Peete wound up with 31 net yards in 5 carries and, like player of the 
game Hoard, 2 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few mistakes by Michigan was a dropped pass by split end Greg 
McMurtry on the USC 15. Quarterback Demetrius Brown hurled the ball nearly 50 
yards in the air, a perfect strike, but it slipped through McMurtry's hands for 
an error. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, no baseball scouts were in the Rose Bowl. McMurtry is such a hot 
baseball prospect that he was offered $172,000 to sign out of high school by 
the Boston Red Sox after they made him their No. 1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
How's this for a firing technique? A Big Ten source said Monday that the 
University of Wisconsin's football troubles may have very well started a year 
ago, when Athletic Director Elroy Hirsch, the Crazy Legs of Rams' fame, was 
called into the office of the interim chancellor and told to sign a sheet of 
paper that was, in essence, his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Wisconsin went 1-10 in football and its once-proud attendance 
showing, always around the 70,000 average mark despite a series of weak teams, 
slipped below the 50,000 average mark.

ROSE BOWL: MICHIGAN 22, USC 14; 
</P>
<P>
MICHIGAN DOESN'T SUFFER A BROWN-OUT IN THIS ROSE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
As Michigan fans counted down the final seconds of the 1989 Rose Bowl Monday, 
Demetrius Brown took the final snap and fell down. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Wolverine quarterback jumped so high you thought he was never going to 
come down. 
</P>
<P>
Brown lofted the ball into the air and pulled it back into his left arm, 
cradling it like a father holding a newborn baby. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to give it to Bo," Brown said, after Michigan presented Schembechler 
with a 22-14 victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
Brown ran through a gantlet of outstretched hands as he jogged into a tunnel 
leading to the locker room. It was a moment of jubilation and vindication. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown doesn't easily display his emotions, he cracked a smile as 
proudly ran off the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Am I happy?" Brown asked. "Yes. This is the Rose Bowl. Everybody felt we 
couldn't do it, but we proved them wrong." 
</P>
<P>
A loner, he planned to celebrate the biggest victory of his career alone. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in pain because I hurt my back in the third quarter," Brown said. "I'm 
going to go rest my tailbone." 
</P>
<P>
Brown helped Michigan ease the pain of losing 7 of its previous 8 Rose Bowl 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
After a poor start, Brown bounced back to lead the Wolverines to 3 second-half 
touchdowns as Michigan overcame a 14-3 halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Although he completed his first 4 passes, Brown misfired on 5 consecutive 
throws as Michigan's offense got out of sync in the first half. He overthrew 
receivers and saw perfectly thrown passes dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with a similar situation in the 1987 season, Brown tried to force his 
passes into double and triple coverage and wound up throwing a school-record 16 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
A year of experience and losing his starting job to Michael Taylor has helped 
him understand himself and the Michigan offense. Brown maintained his poise 
against the Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
When Taylor went down with an injury late this season, Brown went back into the 
lineup and helped the Wolverines win the Big Ten title. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem Demetrius had was that they allowed him to do too much 
because of his abilities," said Mark Messner, Michigan's All-American defensive 
tackle. "He tried to force things. But he's a tremendous talent and (an) 
underrated quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown was overshadowed by Rodney Peete going into the game, Brown was 
more consistent than USC's All-American quarterback in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Brown completed 11 of 24 passes for 144 yards and 1 touchdown, contrasted with 
Peete's 15 of 21 passes for 158 yards with 2 interceptions and 0 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"Demetrius had a great game," split end Greg McMurtry said. "He came out and 
got us in the right plays and did everything he had to do to win that game." 
</P>
<P>
Said Gary Moeller, Michigan's offensive coordinator: "I'm really proud of 
Demetrius. He was the guy everybody expected to throw an interception and he 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Brown set the tone for Michigan's second-half comeback on the last series of 
the first half when he drove the Wolverines from their own 31 to the USC 16 in 
just 1 minute 8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Brown rifled a pass to John Kolesar to get Michigan to midfield and followed 
with a 23-yard strike to Derrick Walker to the Trojan 16. 
</P>
<P>
Although the clock ran out on the Wolverines, the drive re-established Brown's 
confidence and that of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't so much that Demetrius had a bad first half, because everyone had a 
bad first half," offensive tackle Mike Husar said. "We knew we were getting 
beat in the first half, and we weren't going to let it happen in the second 
half." 
</P>
<P>
Brown directed Michigan on a 70-yard touchdown march on the first possession of 
the second half, keeping the Trojan defense off-balance as he deftly mixed the 
plays sent in by Schembechler with some calls of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing an opening in the Trojan defense, Brown called an audible, and the 
Wolverines ran a flanker reverse to Kolesar for 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Kolesar wanted to play this game we had to give him the ball as much 
as we could, and he probably should have been given the ball more," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown wouldn't admit to calling the reverse at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not going to tell you," Schembechler said. "He's very well trained." 
</P>
<P>
Brown set up the touchdown with a 22-yard scramble to the USC 6. He then 
completed a 6-yard touchdown pass play to Chris Calloway for Michigan's first 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
After Brown's passing softened up USC's defense, the Wolverines went to 
fullback Leroy Hoard, who did most of the work when Michigan drove 92 yards to 
score the go-ahead touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Although Hoard was named the player of the game after rushing for 142 yards and 
2 touchdowns, he shared the credit with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Demetrius has really grown a lot," Hoard said. "He made a couple of mistakes 
but he hung in there."

PETER'S PRINCIPLE: MONEY TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BOSWELL, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Christmas, baseball fans get a little gift in their sanitary hose from 
Peter Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
He saved it. With his hardball network TV deal with CBS. And with the cable TV 
deal that he'll work out soon. As recently as a month ago, the '90 season 
looked as if it might be ruined, like '81, or maybe even extinguished, by the 
worst labor war ever in sports. Players were demanding strike clauses in 
contracts while owners negotiated the opposite-lock-out clauses. Stars were 
deferring money to other seasons or else lining up contracts to play in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there's no reason on earth why players will be foolish enough to go on 
strike or the owners will be villanous enough to lock them out. 
</P>
<P>
You see, the game's owners get something in their stockings from the 
commissioner, too. A billion bucks from CBS. Plus a half-billion or more from 
cable TV. Not to mention superstation TV revenues. More cash than even they can 
figure out how to squander. At least for a few years anyway. 
</P>
<P>
As for the players, they get their wish, too. A bright, shiny free market -- 
like the one they had for a decade. Unfettered capitalism reappeared at the 
winter meetings in Atlanta with crazy bidding, and it's not going away. 
Ueberroth was a key player in taking that open market away from players for a 
couple of collusive years. He convinced owners they were about to lose money if 
they didn't wise up and act like sensible monopolists. Now, he's helped give a 
square deal back to the players by making the owners so rich, once more, that 
they can't wait to compete. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, those with a vested interest in the strategy of long-term labor 
negotiations -- Don Fehr of the union and Barry Rona of management -- still 
think a crisis exists. According to sources, both assume there'll be a spring 
training lock out in '90 by owners as a test of union solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
However, those with millions to lose aren't going to shoot themselves in the 
foot just for the experience. Every owner will have at least $5 million a year 
more in his budget thanks to the TV deals. And Lloyd's of London isn't going to 
give the bosses 60 days of strike insurance this time. Conversely, hundreds of 
mediocre players like Tom Neidenfuer and Jeff Leonard, who just got two-year 
contracts for $1.75-million from the poorest franchise in baseball (Seattle), 
are likely to be flexible. 
</P>
<P>
Sabers will be rattled. But they'll be sheathed. Thanks to cash. And pressure 
from millions of us who know there's enough wealth to make 'em all rich. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're thin (economically), that causes (labor) problems," said Ueberroth 
in a telephone interview Tuesday. "But when both sides come to the table with a 
lot at risk, that augers well." 
</P>
<P>
So, renewed free-agent bidding and big TV bucks add up to good labor news? "I 
think that's a tenable conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
For ministers in search of homilies, money may be the root of evil. But to 
Ueberroth, who is business to the core, money is the solution to most problems. 
Sell your product well enough, show enough profit, and you can revive the 
Olympic movement. Find rich new ways to market baseball to television and you 
can wash away the game's labor problems in a yuletide flood of cash. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth's dazzling disregard for moral subtleties, his almost complete 
disinterest in keeping his hands clean, has worked again. His specialty is real 
solutions to real problems. His method, almost invariably, is to use money as 
both the carrot and the stick to defeat the annoying foibles of human nature. 
</P>
<P>
This is the man whose first solution for baseball's drug problem was to pay 
players to stay clean; put bonus clauses in contacts for players who would 
submit to drug testing. This also is the fellow who laid the groundwork for two 
years of legally documented collusion; he called the tune even if he didn't 
actually call the shots. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth's latest success is another ambiguous, but perhaps fitting, seasonal 
message for the age of the leveraged buyout. Would Bowie Kuhn (or Bartlett 
Giamatti, another Ivy League type) have had the gall, or the business 
imagination, to pull off such a TV deal? 
</P>
<P>
Would Kuhn have felt hamstrung by loyalty to baseball's longtime friends at ABC 
and, to a greater degree, at NBC? No major sport owes more to anybody than 
baseball owes to NBC; CBS hasn't telecast a big-league game since 1964. What 
special consideration did NBC get for its 40-year marriage with baseball? 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't tied into going with the highest bidder. Loyalty matters," said 
Ueberroth yesterday. "NBC was playing on something a little better (for them) 
than a level field." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the field wasn't tilted enough to save the peacock. Can anybody imagine 
Kuhn killing "Game of the Week"? That's what Ueberroth did by cutting the 
network package from 30 to 12 regular season games. That means he has a better 
package with which to tempt the cable bidders. However, on CBS we're left with 
the "Game of Every Other Week" -- sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
What about baseball's heartland connection with the folks in Abilene and Fort 
Wayne? Isn't that part of what makes baseball the national pastime? And isn't 
network TV (not cable or local) the umbilical cord of that connection? Kuhn 
thought so. And pushed for, not against, the "Game of The Week". 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth sees no urgent problem. The large majority of Americans still can 
pull in lots of free local broadcasts. "There have been more free games on the 
air every year," says Ueberroth of his tenure. Some day, local games might 
shrivel as cable eats the market. But not now. And Ueberroth thinks now. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to present our season the best way possible," said Ueberroth, who 
thinks that means cable games on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
Who pays for baseball's new riches? The networks, to be sure. It is ironic that 
the same auction mentality that spawned wild free-agent spending now exists 
among the three new management groups at the major networks. "Let's say they've 
become much more competitive," says Ueberroth. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, some of the network's costs get passed along. More directly, the 
well-to-do half of the population that now has cable TV will pay to see its 
choice games. Also, the less affluent, who don't have cable, will "pay" in the 
sense that there will be 18 less network games. 
</P>
<P>
Still, as with much that Ueberroth has accomplished in sports, his results are 
stunningly effective while his methods seem tolerable, considering the benefits 
to important institutions, such as the Olympics and baseball. We are left 
wondering what problems this resourceful loner will tackle next and what novel 
and contrary solutions he will attempt. With money as his sword.

Gerry Faust applauded Lou Holtz, his successor as Notre Dame coach, after the 
top-ranked Fighting Irish claimed the national championship with a Fiesta Bowl 
victory over West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really happy for the kids and Notre Dame and for Lou," Faust said after 
the Irish won, 34-21, Monday night in Tempe, Ariz. "Lou did a heck of a job and 
did very well. I was really happy for them." 
</P>
<P>
Faust, who had a 30-26-1 record as Notre Dame coach from 1981 to 1985, said "it 
would have been great" to have won a national championship for the Irish and 
join former Irish coaches Dan Devine, Ara Parseghian, Knute Rockne and Frank 
Leahy.

FORMER USC COACH HAS CONFERENCE FAVORITE AT RIVERSIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
Riverside College started the basketball season with a new coach and high 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Boyd, former USC coach, took over for Dave Waxman, who took a year off but 
will return next season. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd has three Division I-caliber players in freshmen Bobby Joyce of Santa Ana 
High School, Evric Gray and Leo Toliver. Gray and Joyce had signed letters of 
intent with Nevada Las Vegas and Toliver with UC Irvine, but they would have 
been academically ineligible at the 4-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Empire coaches thought enough of Riverside's potential to make it an 
overwhelming choice to win the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
But by the end of November, Riverside was struggling and Orange Coast, 
Fullerton and Golden West were off to strong starts. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Riverside was as strong as advertised. The Tigers have won 10 of 
their last 11 and are still the favorite to win the conference title among the 
coaches -- but not so overwhelmingly now. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, Orange Coast and Golden West have spent the nonconference schedule 
earning the respect that only Riverside had when the season began. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, defending champion Cypress and Saddleback have struggled. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-game conference schedule starts Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. with Fullerton at 
Rancho Santiago, Cypress at Saddleback and Golden West at Riverside. Orange 
Coast has a bye. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a closer look at the conference: 
</P>
<P>
CYPRESS (7-9): The Chargers reached the state semifinals last season with a 
sophomore-dominated team. This season, the freshman-dominated team has 
struggled but has played better of late. Cypress finished fifth in the 16-team 
Rotary National Shootout in Mesa, Ariz., last week. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress is led in the middle by freshman Andre Lamoureux, a 6-foot 9-inch 
forward who had signed to play at UCLA, but left when Walt Hazzard was replaced 
by Jim Harrick. Lamoureux, from Los Alamitos High School, leads the team with 
13.1 points and 5.1 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress' backcourt is well-stocked but also inexperienced. Mike Varos is a 
sophomore starter and is joined by freshman Vince Hizon, who didn't play much 
for Mater Dei High School last season. Hizon leads Cypress with 12.3-point 
average. Freshman Grayle Humphrey (Sonora) and sophomore Mike Reid start in 
swing spots. 
</P>
<P>
Dirk Paul (Edison), Jay Barrington (Ukiah) and Wendall Lauderdale (Kennedy) 
give Cypress three more freshman guards who have shared time this season. 
</P>
<P>
FULLERTON (15-3): The Hornets have the tallest starting front line in the 
conference. Sophomore Geoff Adams (6-6) and freshman Daryl Griffin (6-7) start 
at the low posts and Mike Goff, a 6-6 freshman from Magnolia, also plays up 
front, but can shoot from outside as well. Griffin leads the team, averaging 15 
points a game, Adams is averaging 11 points and Goff 12.4. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Jessie Lynwood from Santa Ana and sophomore Kelli McKinney start in 
the backcourt. Fullerton is also strong off the bench, with guard Jeff Stewart 
and forward Lindsay Pettis, brother of Detroit outfielder Gary. Forward Mark 
Lyon, a teammate of Goff's at Magnolia, is also a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
GOLDEN WEST (15-4): The Rustlers are off to their best start in 5 years and 
have equaled last season's victory total. Forward Markus Muller-Stach and guard 
Elbert Davis, both sophomores, have helped lead the way. Muller-Stach is the 
top scorer with 22 points a game, Davis does most of the ballhandling with 8.3 
assists a game. He also averages 14 points a game. Alex Kreps, a 6-6 forward, 
is scoring 14 points with 6 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Moser, who missed last season with a knee injury, is starting at forward. 
Returning sophomore Carl Champion and freshman Kevin Anderson (Fountain Valley) 
are also starting. 
</P>
<P>
ORANGE COAST (15-3): The Pirates might be the surprise of the nonconference 
season and one of the main reasons is the inside play of freshman forward Alan 
Schlines from Foothill High School. Schlines, a 6-6 forward, is averaging 15.5 
points and 8 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
OCC's problem will be finding enough height up front. Scott DeStefano (6-3) and 
Chip Hanlon (6-5) also play up front. Sophomores Dareck Crane and LaMont Speed 
return in the backcourt. Crane is averaging 15 points and 5 assists and Speed 
is averaging 9 points. Sophomore guard Derek Johnson is averaging 12 points a 
game and is the team's best threat from the 3-point range. 
</P>
<P>
RANCHO SANTIAGO (10-6): Forward Tony Smalley and guard Chris Martin, both 
starters as freshmen last season, return for Rancho Santiago. They will have to 
play well for the Dons to contend. Both are averaging 13 points a game, but 
neither has been as consistent as Coach Dana Pagett would like. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Santiago's biggest problem has been at center. Corie Blount (6-8) was 
starting but sprained his ankle. Sophomore Mike Oden and freshman Matt Lien 
were effective splitting time in the Rancho Santiago tournament last week, so 
it looks like center by committee. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hunter, a freshman from Edison High School, also starts up front with 
Smalley. Gene Altamirano, a freshman from Los Amigos, is the other backcourt 
starter. Hunter leads the team with 6.6 rebounds a game and Altamirano is 
averaging 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
RIVERSIDE (16-6): Waxman, who took a year off from coaching to work on his 
doctorate, was replaced by Boyd, who retired in 1979 after 13 seasons at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce, a 6-8 forward from Santa Ana High School, is averaging 19 points and 11 
rebounds a game. Joyce was the most valuable player in the Century League last 
season as Santa Ana won the league title. Gray is averaging 12 points and 8 
rebounds a game. Corey Arnett, a 6-5 forward, and Michael Stewart, who was an 
all-conference guard 2 seasons ago but sat out last season with an injury, also 
return. 
</P>
<P>
SADDLEBACK (7-9): There are plenty of new faces at Saddleback. Ernie Carr has 
taken over as coach for Bill Brummel, who is taking a year off to observe Bob 
Knight's program at Indiana. Carr, an assistant at UCLA last season, also has 
coached at Dominguez High School, where he still teaches. 
</P>
<P>
Carr is joined by 11 freshmen and sophomore forward Bradd Heckman, who is 
averaging 8.4 points a game. Heckman scored 43 points all last season but had a 
career-high 31 Friday against Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback is led up front by freshman Vincent Mason, a 6-4 forward from 
University High School in Philadelphia. He is averaging 16.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Keyes, a guard from Washington High School in Los Angeles, leads the team 
with 17.8 points a game. Tyrone Meixsell of Dana Hills, Jeff Springfield of 
Mission Viejo and Wun Versher and Antone Curtis, both from Dominguez, also have 
played a great deal.

In less than 7 minutes, the Washington Capitals put 7 games of frustration 
against the Pittsburgh Penguins behind them. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals scored 5 goals, including 2 by Bengt Gustafsson, in a 6:56 span of 
the second period and snapped a 7-game losing streak against Pittsburgh with an 
8-0 victory Monday at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good sign for us," said Geoff Courtnall of Washington's first victory 
over the Penguins since Jan. 1, 1988. "It's a big win. We need to play this way 
every time. To dominate like that was surprising. But it's just one game." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Christian also had 2 goals for the Capitals, who held Mario Lemieux 
scoreless for the first time in his last 15 games. Goalie Pete Peeters handed 
Pittsburgh its first shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins had scored at least 2 goals in their previous 37 games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh, with defensemen Paul Coffey and Zarley Zalapski injured and forward 
Bob Errey out with the flu, was outshot, 45-14. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux, the league's leading scorer who had 32 points in his previous 9 games, 
including 8 Saturday against New Jersey, had only 1 shot on goal. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the Capitals) were at the top of their game, and we were at the bottom 
of ours," Pittsburgh Coach Gene Ubriaco said. "They didn't give us a chance to 
get unwound. (We) have to play better than (we) played." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the worst of the season for the Patrick Division leaders. 
Pittsburgh had lost only once in 10 previous games and was 4-1-2 in its 
previous 7 road games. 
</P>
<P>
Capital Coach Bryan Murray said he saw it coming, predicting in a team meeting 
that the team would get plenty of shots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one game in our building," he said. "I thought, watching the last few 
games we had played, there would be some opportunity to shoot the puck. It was 
a matter of taking advantage of our opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Washington extended its home unbeaten streak to 8 games, 6 of them victories, 
and its 8 goals equaled a season high. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 3, Minnesota 2 -- Esa Tikkanen's 24th goal of the season, 3:10 into 
overtime, lifted the Oilers to a victory over the North Stars at Bloomington, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota's Stewart Gavin tied the game, 2-2, with 4:34 left in the third 
period on a feed from Bob Rouse after Charlie Huddy's power-play goal with 6:57 
left gave the Oilers a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars scored first on Neal Broten's goal 49 seconds into the second 
period, and the Oilers got even on Jimmy Carson's 31st goal at 1:56 of the 
third period. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 5, Hartford 4 -- David Shaw scored a pair of power-play goals, 
including the go-ahead goal early in the third period, and the Rangers turned 
back the Whalers at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Former Whaler Carey Wilson, acquired in a 4-player trade just a week ago, 
scored the tying goal for the Rangers before Shaw put them ahead, 4-3, with a 
shot from the point at 7:28. Rookie Tony Granato clinched the victory on a 
breakaway goal at 18:41. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers, who are 4-0-1 in their last 5 games, moved to within 2 points of 
Pittsburgh in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 8, St. Louis 7 -- Rookie center Craig Janney, returning after missing 8 
games with a groin injury, set up 4 goals to lead the Bruins past the Blues at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Janney's 3 assists helped Boston to a 7-3 lead after three periods, and after 
St. Louis rallied with 3 straight goals in the final period, Janney set up Bob 
Joyce's goal that proved to be the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who beat New Jersey, 6-2, on Thursday, won consecutive games for 
the first time since late November.

Tom Chambers scored 12 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter as the Phoenix 
Suns rallied to a 125-122 victory over the Washington Bullets Monday night 
before 3,729, the smallest crowd for a National Basketball Assn. game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the Suns' sixth in their last 7 games, and their first at the 
Capital Centre since Jan. 26, 1985. Phoenix, which beat the Bullets by 38 
points last month, is 17-11. Washington fell to 8-19, the same record it had 
after 27 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
Neither club led by more than 2 points in the fourth quarter until Chambers hit 
a pair of free throws with 4:30 to play after Eddie Johnson converted the first 
of 2 fourth-quarter technical fouls assessed the Bullets by referee Blaine 
Reichelt. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Corbin followed with a jumper at 3:52, his only points of the second 
half, to make it 115-110.

<P>
PAT RILEY DOESN'T ALWAYS TAKE THE FASHIONABLE STAND WITH THE LAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sam McManis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can disregard all those obvious reasons, such as a rough road schedule and 
lack of an inside game, for the Lakers' worst slump in a decade. No, the 
problem could well be the dreaded GQ cover jinx. 
</P>
<P>
The fashion magazine for men made Laker Coach Pat Riley the cover story in its 
January issue, which, coincidentally or not, hit the newsstands at the same 
time the Lakers' road losing streak hit 6 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Riley profile was written by former Los Angeles Herald Examiner columnist 
Diane K. Shah. 
</P>
<P>
So, for those who cannot afford $3 for Gentleman's Quarterly, let alone the 
clothes advertised on its pages, a few of the highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Riley always wears oxford cloth shirts at Laker games because they absorb 
perspiration. This custom came about after Riley wore a silk suit in the Boston 
Garden and sent the suit back to the tailor because of perspiration stains. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Riley still is somewhat bothered that, despite coaching the Lakers to 4 
National Basketball Assn. titles in 7 seasons, he has not been voted coach of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson is quoted as saying: "There's an ego factor with Pat that didn't 
used to be there. Wanting to be recognized as a good coach. He's not 
overbearing about it, he just needs it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Late last summer, during Riley's contract renegotiation troubles with owner 
Jerry Buss, he threatened to resign. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, the Laker hierarchy prepared a list of replacements. Billy 
Cunningham and Dick Motta topped the list. But the Lakers eventually decided 
that, if Riley left, they would turn over the team to assistant Randy Pfund for 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario was first detailed by the Copley newspapers last summer, but 
never confirmed by anyone in Laker management. Riley, of course, worked out his 
contract troubles and last week signed a 4-season extension. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Many of Riley's idiosyncrasies were detailed. 
</P>
<P>
During a 10-game winning streak one season, in which everything was going well 
for the Lakers, Riley approached trainer Gary Vitti and complained that the 
chalk was too hard. He wanted softer chalk to write with. 
</P>
<P>
When the Lakers reported to Hawaii for training camp last fall, Riley wanted 
the rims of the basket painted bright orange and the bolts on the backboard 
replaced. Vitti had the rims painted, but the original bolts remained. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The letters Riley sends to his players every August, detailing goals for 
the season, are dunked into the nearest waste basket, according to team 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Riley said he has read the article, which was mostly positive, and has no 
problem with it. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was accurate," Riley said. "I'm a pretty obsessive, driven guy. A 
perfectionist. I admit to that." 
</P>
<P>
But well-dressed. 
</P>
<P>
Was that GQ for 4-H? When the magazine sent Josh Rosenfeld, the Lakers' public 
relations director, copies of the January issue, the box was addressed to the 
"Great Western Farm." 
</P>
<P>
When the Chicago Bulls met the New York Knicks for the first time in Chicago 
since the seemingly one-sided Bill Cartwright-for-Charles Oakley trade, Bull 
Coach Doug Collins said he expected Oakley to gloat over his success in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
But Collins did not expect to hear the same criticisms from Horace Grant, the 
Bulls' current small forward. Grant told Chicago writers last week that he 
shares Oakley's frustrations of playing a minor offensive role along side 
Michael Jordan, who scores about a third of the Bulls' points. 
</P>
<P>
"I can sympathize with what 'Oak' went through," Grant said. "I'd like to get 
the ball more, but I'm not getting it. It's frustrating. I know Michael is a 
great player, but he can't do it all. We need others to contribute. But I'm not 
getting the chance. Is that too much to ask?" 
</P>
<P>
Collins' reaction: 
</P>
<P>
"Charles (Oakley) averaged 10 shots for us last year. He's getting 9.8 for the 
Knicks this year. They're going well, and I'm happy for Charles. I like him, I 
really do. I'm a former player who understands the ups and downs of this 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"For us to ever be a very good team, we're going to have to be more balanced. 
But people don't understand that with a guy like Michael Jordan it's hard to 
run an offense. He's so good, it distorts the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the new collective bargaining agreement, some veteran NBA players are 
looking forward to unrestricted free agency. One is the Sacramento Kings' Jim 
Petersen, who apparently can't wait to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"All my friends are calling and saying, 'Play here,' or 'Play there,' " 
Petersen said. "It's going to be a difficult decision to make. I know it's a 
business. My heart will speak loud, but the dollar value will in all likelihood 
win out." 
</P>
<P>
On the down side, however, Petersen also knows the Kings might trade him before 
losing him without compensation after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Russell (King general manager) has said he's determined to keep me, but 
there are no loyalties anymore," Petersen said. "You can't be so idealistic to 
think you can't be traded. I'm keeping my bags packed, if not literally, then 
figuratively. It will be sort of like a romance to see what you're worth on the 
open market." 
</P>
<P>
Al Bianchi, the Knicks' general manager, has $712,000 to work with under 
salary-cap restrictions. Bianchi has until August to use the money, which was 
made available when Pat Cummings left, and he has several options: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Knicks need a quality backup center for Patrick Ewing. Eddie Lee 
Wilkens, the current backup, is not sufficient for a first-place team. When 
Ewing went down with a minor knee injury last week -- he missed only 2 days -- 
the Knicks were a mediocre team without him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Knicks have long sought to acquire Portland forward Kiki Vandeweghe, 
whose bad back has delayed any chance of a trade. Vandeweghe, however, is 
supposed to be activated by the Trail Blazers tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sources told Newsday that the Knicks still want to bring Golden State 
forward Chris Mullin back home to New York. Mullin will be a restricted free 
agent after this season and, if Mullin signs a 1-year contract then, he will be 
an unrestricted free agent in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Portland forward Clyde Drexler was married last Friday in New Orleans. He met 
his bride, Gaynell Floyd, on a blind date last season. She obviously wasn't 
impressed immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"On the first date I asked him, 'How long have you been in the NFL?' " Floyd 
said. "At the time, I didn't know a thing about basketball." 
</P>
<P>
The NBA continues to hand out stiff fines for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Including the exhibition season, there already have been 6 skirmishes. There 
were 3 alone last week, totaling $12,000 in fines. Those fights were 
Milwaukee's Jay Humphries vs. Indiana's Scott Skiles; the Knicks' Oakley vs. 
Atlanta's Doc Rivers; and Houston's Akeem Olajuwon's one-sided, one-hand slap 
of Miami's John Shasky. 
</P>
<P>
A troubled season for the New Jersey Nets was eased somewhat last week by a 
visit from the Indiana Pacers, who had lost 13 straight road games. As 
expected, the Nets breezed to a 17-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
"This means I don't have to . . . worry about my dog biting me," Net Coach 
Willis Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
Trade rumor of the week: Dallas newspapers reported that the Mavericks were 
talking with the Boston Celtics about acquiring Kevin McHale. One account had 
Boston trading McHale for Sam Perkins, Detlef Schrempf and a first-round draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
Celtic General Manager Jan Volk said he has not even contemplated trading 
McHale. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, however, apparently is on the market. His contract expires at the 
season's end, but he would have to take a hefty salary cut to fit into the 
Celtics' salary-cap restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there's some truth to all the trade talk," Perkins told Peter May of 
the Hartford Courant. "There just has been so much of it since I came to 
Dallas. I just have a gut feeling that if something doesn't happen by February, 
then it will by the summer. I just feel it's a move the franchise wants to 
make. I'm happy here, I'm settled. But I guess I may need to get unsettled." 
</P>
<P>
Things keep getting worse for the Pacers, who have the NBA's worst 
non-expansion record. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, who have lost 8 straight games, learned last week that center Steve 
Stipanovich will not return for at least another 2 months. Stipanovich has not 
played this season, having undergone left knee surgery on Nov. 18. The 
operation was to relieve pain in his left leg above the knee cap. 
</P>
<P>
"There still is pretty much pain," Stipanovich said. "It basically means it's 
going to be a few more weeks, at least, before I'll be able to do anything as 
far as rehabilitation. If everything goes well, I'll be able to play in 7 or 8 
weeks."

VERY SUBTLE WINS LAS FLORES HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Very Subtle pulled away in the stretch to win the $70,600 Las Flores Handicap 
by 3 lengths over Sadie B. Fast before a crowd of 29,001 Monday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
Ridden by Laffit Pincay and carrying high weight of 124 pounds, Very Subtle 
covered 6 furlongs in 1:08 3-5 and paid $2.60 to win. 
</P>
<P>
Sadie B. Fast, ridden by Bill Shoemaker and carrying 113 pounds, was 3 1/2 
lengths ahead of Comical Cat at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
The $5 exacta of Very Subtle and Sadie B. Fast paid $18. Serve N' Volley was 
scratched. Because there were only three entries in the 37th running of the 
race for older fillies and mares, there was no place or show wagering. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the 12th in 26 starts for Very Subtle, a 5-year-old daughter of 
Hoist the Silver, and the $44,350 top prize increased her career earnings to 
$1,560,860.

N.C. STATE STRUGGLES BUT BEATS TOWSON ST.

<TEXT>
<P>
North Carolina State was expected to extend its winning streak to 5 games 
Monday night. After all, the No. 16 Wolfpack was playing at home in Raleigh, 
N.C., and the opponent was lightly regarded Towson State. 
</P>
<P>
Well, North Carolina State won, 83-77, but it wasn't easy. The Wolfpack 
struggled for most of the game. In fact, they trailed, 32-25, with 6:08 left in 
the first half before going ahead at halftime, 46-38. 
</P>
<P>
The Wolfpack built the lead to 75-63 with 7:30 left, and managed to maintain a 
double-figure advantage until the Tigers scored 6 straight points to cut the 
margin to 77-73 with 3:44 left. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State (7-1) could not increase the lead to more than 6 points 
down the stretch, and 2 free throws by John Bays with 17 seconds left cut the 
Wolfpack lead to 81-77. Chris Corchianni's 2 free throws with 6 seconds left 
accounted for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
Rodney Monroe and Chucky Brown each scored 23 points for the Wolfpack. Bays 
finished with 16 points to lead 6 players in double figures for Towson State 
(5-4). 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State 79, Maryland 77 -- Chris Jackson scored 15 of LSU's final 17 
points, including an 18-foot jumper with 8 seconds left, to give the Tigers the 
victory at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, who finished with 30 points, had only 2 free throws in the first 12:24 
of the second half, but he took control down the stretch to lead LSU (8-3) to 
its fourth straight victory. 
</P>
<P>
Maryland (6-5) didn't make a field goal in the final 6:33 of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
California 70, Colorado 54 -- The Bears, 9-20 last season, won for the ninth 
time in their last 10 games and also improved their record at Berkeley to 7-0 
by routing the Buffaloes. 
</P>
<P>
Center Leonard Taylor scored 21 points to lead Cal (10-3), which took a 19-5 
lead 9 minutes into the game and never trailed. Colorado, which got no closer 
than 8 points in the second half, is 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 75, U. San Diego 57 -- Mitch Smith scored 14 of his 20 points in the 
second half to lead the Utes past the Toreros at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
Smith also had 11 rebounds and 7 assists for Utah (9-6), which has won 8 of its 
last 9 games, is 9-6. San Diego is 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming 97, Drake 85 -- Reggie Fox scored 30 points, including 13 on free 
throws, to lead the Cowboys past the Bulldogs at Laramie, Wyo. 
</P>
<P>
The win, which improved Wyoming's record to 7-5, gave Coach Benny Dees his 
100th career victory. Drake is 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Tech 96, North Texas 57 -- Randy White had 18 points and 14 rebounds 
to lead Tech at Ruston, La., in a game in which 9 players were ejected after a 
bench-clearing brawl with 3:42 remaining to play. 
</P>
<P>
White was one of the players ejected after officials used a television crew's 
videotape, causing an 18-minute delay, to review a flagrant foul by Tech's 
Vernon Norris and the pushing, shoving, punching and fighting that followed. 
</P>
<P>
Tech is 7-4, North Texas 3-7.

THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: AFTER SERIOUS CAR ACCIDENT, SAUGUS RUNNER SCOBIE IS 
ON HER WAY BACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Less than 15 months ago, Heather Scobie, a junior at Saugus High School, was a 
talented runner of great promise. 
</P>
<P>
As a freshman, she was one of the country's best cross-country runners, placing 
17th in a field of 1,500 in the Kinney Western Regional meet. In the spring, 
she placed eighth in the state track and field final in the 1,600 meters. 
</P>
<P>
After an injury-plagued sophomore year, during which she placed third in the 
high school mile in the Sunkist Invitational indoor meet, Scobie was hoping for 
an outstanding junior campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the rainy afternoon of Halloween, 1987, when Scobie was involved in a 
head-on car accident on Sierra Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Scobie suffered many injuries, including broken ribs, fractured vertebrae in 
her lower back and internal bleeding caused by severed abdominal muscles. Her 
friends, Melissa Zidle and Shauna Bird, suffered cuts and broken bones, and a 
passenger in the other car died. 
</P>
<P>
Scobie underwent 3 1/2 hours of surgery on her stomach muscles. Doctors told 
her parents that she might never walk again, let alone resume her running 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Her mother, Pat Scobie, said: "I just didn't believe that things were as bad as 
they were. Heather couldn't move until she had surgery because of the danger of 
severing nerves in her back. I stayed with her in the hospital for 2 weeks. We 
never gave up hope." 
</P>
<P>
Doctors had to wait 8 days after the stomach surgery to operate on Scobie's 
back. After the 4-hour operation, in which two 8-inch rods were inserted in her 
back, Scobie spent 3 months in a body cast. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the seriousness of her injuries, Scobie did not have any doubts about 
returning to the athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not want to think anything negative," said Scobie, who started to jog 6 
months after the accident. "My parents were always positive when I saw them, 
and that helped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Scobie, now 17, has made incredible strides since her setback. She ran in 
several cross-country meets this past fall, including the Kinney Western 
Regional. She again will run n the Sunkist Invitational, Jan. 20 in the Sports 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Scobie is not at the same level she was before her accident -- Saugus Coach 
Mike Parker says she is about 80% -- but her competitive desire remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
"My training now just consists of short jogs because of the pain (in her 
stomach and back)," said Scobie. "But I will give it my best shot at the 
Sunkist meet." 
</P>
<P>
Scobie, who will have additional surgery this summer on her stomach and will 
have the rods removed from her back, added: "I am just glad that I am still 
able to run." 
</P>
<P>
Reseda Cleveland (7-2) won the Las Vegas Holiday Tournament at Nevada Las Vegas 
by defeating Fairdale (Ky.), 74-62, in the final. Cleveland's Lucius Harris, 
who scored 21 points in the final, was named the tournament's most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (9-3) reached the quarterfinals before losing to Cleveland, 
85-67. John Hardy, a 6-foot 4-inch senior forward, averaged 32.8 points in the 
tournament, second highest in its 12-year history. He also led the tournament 
with a 12.8 rebounding average. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood (5-4), behind the play of USC-bound Harold Miner, also played well in 
the tournament, winning 3 of 5 games. The 6-5 Miner, who did not play in 
Inglewood's last game because of an ankle injury, averaged 29.8 points and 12 
rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester (6-3), which traveled to Pine Bluff, Ark., to play in the King 
Cotton tournament, shot only 32% in a semifinal loss to Flint Hill Prep of 
Oakton, Va., and 35% in a loss to Westwood of Memphis in the third-place final.

BIDDER HOT ON THE HEELS OF DATAPRODUCTS; 
</P>
<P>
JOHN K. CASTLE IS KNOWN AS TOUGH AND TENACIOUS. HIS TARGET, A LAGGING COMPUTER 
PRINTER MAKER, MAY FIND HIM DIFFICULT TO SHAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the nicknames given John K. Castle a few years ago by some of the people 
who worked for him on Wall Street was the "Doberman Pinscher." 
</P>
<P>
The inspiration for the nickname was Castle's tough, intimidating way of 
running things at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the Wall Street investment 
firm where he ran day-to-day operations as president for more than five years 
and served for nearly two years as chief executive. Some likened Castle's 
abrasive management style to that of Gen. George S. Patton, citing occasional 
temper tantrums that resulted in telephone cords being yanked from walls. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Castle, 48, is credited with making DLJ the most consistently profitable 
firm on Wall Street in the years leading up to its acquisition by Equitable 
Life Assurance Society of the United States for $460 million in November, 1984. 
Tired of running such a big company for an even bigger company, Castle resigned 
in 1986 to form his own investment firm, Castle Harlan Inc. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Valued at About $300 million 
</P>
<P>
Whether the man once likened to a ferocious guard dog has a bark that is worse 
than his bite is something being pondered by directors of Dataproducts Corp., a 
Woodland Hills computer printer maker. In late December, Castle and partner 
Crescott Inc., a New York vending machine and food service company, disclosed 
that they own 5.2% of Dataproducts' stock and may seek control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
Castle and Crescott have indicated informally to Dataproducts that they might 
pay $15 a share to buy the company, which would put its value at nearly $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Those familiar with Dataproducts, the nation's largest independent computer 
printer maker, are not surprised that the 26-year-old company may finally have 
attracted a bidder. For three years the company has been frequently mentioned 
by investors and analysts as ripe for a takeover bid because of its low stock 
price, substantial assets and poor earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel Dataproducts' shareholders might be particularly well served by the 
sale of the company," Castle said. 
</P>
<P>
Castle met twice in October with Chairman Jack C. Davis. Castle said Davis 
listened cordially to his presentation but has since indicated that the company 
isn't interested in being sold. 
</P>
<P>
The company's profits have been wildly inconsistent, with a $20-million loss in 
the fiscal year that ended March 26 on sales of $345 million, most of the 
deficit stemming from costs associated with closing a New Hampshire plant. In 
the six months ended Sept. 24, Dataproducts earned a paper-thin $2 million on 
sales of $174 million. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock languished for most of last year at about $10 a share, well 
below the $31 that it traded at five years ago. The stock closed Friday 
unchanged at $13.50. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Fortune 500 List 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts sits atop a pile of assets that could be used to help finance a 
buyout, including an estimated $50 million in cash and 21 acres of land in 
Woodland Hills' Warner Center, which some San Fernando Valley real estate 
experts believe could be worth from $25 million to as much as $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts sells its computer printers to large computer equipment makers 
such as IBM, Digital Equipment and Wang, which resell them with their own 
computer equipment. Through the early 1980s, Dataproducts was successful 
selling "impact printers," which print characters by striking the paper much as 
a typewriter does. It helped the company earn $27.7 million on sales of $472 
million in the year ended March 30, 1985, which at the time landed it on the 
Fortune 500 list of the nation's largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
But the company was slow getting into the market for laser printers, which 
produce sharp images using a laser beam directed at photographic paper. Much of 
its efforts the past two years has gone into developing and selling a quiet 
ink-jet printer that uses ink stored in a Crayon-like bar. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, former Dataproducts Chairman Graham Tyson steered the company through 
a painful retrenchment that saw its worldwide work force slashed to 4,000 from 
6,000. Indeed, the company made light of its problems in its 1986 annual report 
with a goofy picture showing 12 of its top officers dressed in bright-yellow 
raincoats standing in front of the company's office. The message: Dataproducts 
had "weathered the storm." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Chief Well Paid 
</P>
<P>
That year the directors hired Davis, a former Harris Corp. executive, to 
recharge the company, paying him handsomely to do it; he earned $483,000 in the 
last fiscal year. Yet so far, he has had to weather his own storms, in part 
because the printer market has not picked up substantially and the ink-jet 
printer has been slow to take off. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts offices were closed last week for the holidays. Davis, who 
Dataproducts executives said was skiing in Lake Tahoe, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Board members who were contacted declined to talk in detail about the possible 
takeover threat but said Davis enjoys their support. They believe that the 
company's sluggish performance the past couple of years was largely because of 
a soft market for printers and not any management blunders. 
</P>
<P>
"The board supports Jack completely on what he wants to do here. In this kind 
of market, Jack has done a hell of a job," said Jack D. Steele, a director and 
business consultant who formerly was dean of USC's School of Business 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Tyson, a director who helped start Dataproducts, said of Davis, "We are 100% 
behind him." 
</P>
<P>
But Castle's partner in buying the Dataproducts' stock, Crescott President 
Munawar (Micki) Hidayatallah, blames Dataproducts' lackluster performance on 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wants Friendly Deal 
</P>
<P>
"There is no sensitivity to stockholder interest in management's thinking. You 
have a chief executive who has been with the company for two years, owns very 
little stock, is paid a good salary and is the man who would be king," 
Hidayatallah said. 
</P>
<P>
Castle said he wants a friendly deal with management. But Dataproducts wouldn't 
be the first time he and Crescott have tried an unsolicited bid. Last year, 
they launched a $90-million bid for William Carter, a children's clothing 
company in Needham Heights, Mass. The company found a friendly buyer in Wesray 
Capital Corp., which bid $116 million. 
</P>
<P>
To buy Dataproducts stock, Castle formed an alliance with his friend, 
Pakistan-born businessman Hidayatallah, a member of a prominent Pakistani 
family who fled the country in the early 1970s, when much of his family's 
business was seized by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was deposed as leader in 1977 
and executed two years later. 
</P>
<P>
One of Crescott's most successful investments was the Orange Julius chain, 
which it sold for $23.5 million to International Dairy Queen in 1987. 
Hidayatallah said Crescott's profit from the sale of the company and dividends 
it received came to about $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
Crescott is primarily an investment vehicle now, but has some operations. Among 
them are 12,000 vending machines, including those in the federal gold 
depository at Ft. Knox, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances say one of Castle's strengths is an uncanny recall of numbers and 
details. Perrin Long, who follows the brokerage industry as an analyst for 
Lipper Analytical Services, recalls that when Castle ran DLJ he could recall 
any number Long needed from memory. Long adds that although Castle was 
demanding as a boss at DLJ, he deserves credit for keeping the brokerage's 
costs under control, hiring good people and keeping the company on a steady 
growth plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equitable Owns 20% 
</P>
<P>
"He has an abrasive attitude, and I can't deny it. But he has the ability to 
say no. If you only have the ability to say yes, nothing will get 
accomplished," Long said. 
</P>
<P>
Castle says he's matured since the days when he developed the reputation for 
being abrasive and he considers it something of a bum rap anyway. "I think I'm 
viewed as a fair, demanding manager," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dataproducts has a standard group of anti-takeover shields in place, including 
a "poison pill" to make it prohibitively expensive for an unwanted suitor to 
buy the company and staggered election of its directors. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Castle's old employer, Equitable Life, is Dataproducts' biggest 
shareholder with about 20% of the stock. Castle said he became interested in 
Dataproducts independently while looking for undervalued businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Should relations turn hostile, Dataproducts is likely to have a tough foe to 
deal with. Although his firm, Castle Harlan, is small, it controls some $20 
billion in assets, mostly through Delaware Fund, a money management firm 
acquired for about $300 million last March by a limited partnership Castle 
formed. 
</P>
<P>
Castle said he and Crescott are well financed and that buying Dataproducts 
would not be difficult. "I've done much bigger deals than this. I've done deals 
in the billions of dollars," he said.

FIRMS EXAMINE ENTERTAINMENT, TRAVEL COSTS; 
</P>
<P>
EXECUTIVES SEEK WAYS TO CUT BACK, SURVEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many companies will begin 1989 by trying to streamline and reduce travel and 
entertainment costs, one of the largest controllable expenses for many firms. 
</P>
<P>
With airlines making 150,000 fare changes a day, it is no surprise that 
corporate travel expenses frequently soar out of control, according to American 
Express travel consultant Judith Dettinger-Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, American companies spent an estimated $95 billion on travel and 
entertainment. By 1990, the amount is expected to reach $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Express 1988 travel management survey, travel and 
entertainment expenses are the third-largest controllable expense for most 
companies, after salaries and data processing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seek Out Best Fares 
</P>
<P>
Dettinger-Gardner, who oversees the American Express Survey of Business Travel 
Management, said a company can save 30% to 35% on travel expenses by requiring 
employees to purchase the lowest logical air fare when they travel on business. 
</P>
<P>
"Companies should establish a good travel policy and distribute it to 
everyone," said Dettinger-Gardner. "Then they should find a good travel agency 
to help monitor and control expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Even the smallest business can benefit from a good relationship with a 
reputable agent who seeks the most economical fares and provides a detailed, 
monthly travel report to the company, Dettinger-Gardner said. Too many 
companies create a flurry of paper work and confusion by relying on too many 
travel agents. In fact, Dettinger-Gardner recently consulted with one Fortune 
500 company that was using 273 different travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to manage travel and entertainment expenses has become a major concern 
for executives, according to the survey. Fifty-five percent of the respondents 
from 1,600 companies, government and educational organization said rising 
travel and entertainment costs represent one of management's top concerns. 
Sixty-two percent of the respondents believed that employee travel is 
occasionally abused and must be closely monitored. And 29% of the respondents 
have hired a corporate travel manager, up from 16% two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Internally, a company can do several things to keep a tighter rein on travel 
costs. Dettinger-Gardner said it is cheaper in the long run to issue credit 
cards to employees who travel frequently, rather than offer large cash 
advances, which are frequently misspent. A small cash advance of $10 or $15 a 
day to cover tips, tolls and taxis is enough for most trips, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that provide generous meal allowances and do not require receipts for 
expenses less than $25 also encourage travel expense abuse, according to 
Dettinger-Gardner. She suggests that companies require receipts for any travel 
or entertainment expense of more than $10 or $15. And, she recommends that 
someone carefully check the receipts to make sure they are legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
"One fellow we encountered visited three major cities but turned in 
consecutively numbered tear tab (receipts) that he bought at a stationery 
store," said Dettinger-Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questioning Traveler 
</P>
<P>
One way to reduce abuse is to do more than just add up the math on travel 
expense reports, according to Dettinger-Gardner. She said the person reviewing 
expense reports should check to see where and how the airline tickets were 
purchased and question the traveler if the tickets were not purchased through 
the company's authorized travel agent. Frequent flier programs that reward 
travelers with free trips are also "a big problem" for businesses, according to 
Dettinger-Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
"They entice travelers to make decisions not based on price," she said, adding 
that it is nearly impossible for a company to keep track of frequent flier 
mileage or require employees to turn in their free trips. 
</P>
<P>
"One company hired seven people to keep track of the frequent flier miles," she 
said. "And even with that, only two out of 200 people turned in their free 
trips to the company." 
</P>
<P>
PUTTING THE BRAKES ON TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT COSTS 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 40% of the executives surveyed said travel and entertainment costs 
increased by at least 10% between 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Increased 10% or more: 38% 
</P>
<P>
Increased less than 10%: 29% 
</P>
<P>
Remained the same: 14% 
</P>
<P>
Decreased: 16% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fewer than half of those surveyed -- 42% -- said they felt "extremely" or 
"very" successful at managing costs. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhat successful: 47% 
</P>
<P>
Very successful: 35% 
</P>
<P>
Slightly successful: 10% 
</P>
<P>
Extremely successful: 7% 
</P>
<P>
Not at all successful: 1% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The following cost-control measures were found to be effective by more than 60% 
of survey respondents. 
</P>
<P>
Tighten receipt requirements: 67% 
</P>
<P>
Require travelers to take lowest 'logical' airfare: 66% 
</P>
<P>
Consolidate travel arrangements to fewer travel agencies: 63% 
</P>
<P>
Designate mid-level manager to handle travel: 63%

NEW VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM TARGETS MINORITY ENTREPRENEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 12 years that Gregory B. Boyd spent working in corporate lending 
departments at banks in California and Texas, his employers helped finance only 
one minority business. Now, as a principal of a new Los Angeles venture capital 
fund, Boyd hopes to improve the odds for cash-strapped minority entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
Backed with $500,000 in seed money from Lynwood-based Economic Resources Corp., 
a nonprofit economic development corporation that has been instrumental in 
developing an industrial park near Watts, Boyd, 35, and his partners, Kenneth 
T. Lombard and Lance Drummond, hope to raise $25 million from pension funds and 
corporations to launch the ERC Capital Fund Ventures Partnership next month. 
</P>
<P>
Theirs would be the first organized fund west of the Mississippi to raise 
private money to buy a stake in minority businesses in hopes of turning a 
profit. The three say they are particularly interested in financing 
minority-run companies in manufacturing, telecommunications and real estate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Formidable Odds 
</P>
<P>
"Our job is to get minorities launched in significant businesses of significant 
magnitude in a wide range of industries where we feel there is some upside," 
Boyd said. "The problem has been that capital has not been available. And we 
say to our investors, 'Here's a way to satisfy social concerns and also make 
money.' " 
</P>
<P>
Historically, minority entrepreneurs have had to rely on banks or special 
government programs, such as Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment 
Corporations, or MESBICs, for financing. But with huge public pension funds 
starting to earmark some of their assets for affirmative action and with 
Southern California's reputation as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, Boyd said he 
is convinced that ERC is perfectly positioned to be a force in the competitive 
venture capital field. 
</P>
<P>
But others say the three will face formidable odds in pursuing their agenda in 
the venture capital business, a maturing industry that in its early years 
helped launch such well-known companies as Federal Express and MCI 
Communications Corp. Today, some 650 venture capital firms across the nation 
manage about $30 billion, according to Venture Capital Journal, a trade 
magazine. But as money has flooded in, returns have fallen. And lately big 
investors have turned skittish. 
</P>
<P>
"Venture capital financing has become much less popular in recent years and 
downright unpopular in some circles," said Burton J. McMurtry, past chairman of 
the National Venture Capital Assn. and a general partner of the venture capital 
firm Technology Venture Investors in Menlo Park. "It's least popular among big 
institutional investors who threw a lot of money at the venture capital 
industry in the early 1980s, when it was at its peak. Now that returns are 
down, they're pulling their money out." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the industry's past largess did not greatly benefit minority 
firms, said Gavin M. Chen, a senior economist with the Commerce Department's 
Minority Business Development Agency. Chen said black, Latino and Asian-owned 
firms received less than 5% of the equity financing provided by venture 
capitalists in 1982, the latest year for which figures are available. And he 
speculated that the percentages haven't changed significantly since then. 
</P>
<P>
Two other privately managed minority venture capital funds founded several 
years ago -- UNC Partners in Boston and Syndicated Communications in Washington 
-- have made some inroads, financing dozens of minority businesses. But ERC's 
venture fund could face significant resistance in raising money because it 
hasn't built a track record. 
</P>
<P>
"We would not hire (invest with) anybody without experience," said William O. 
Bell, the chief investment official at Florida's state pension plan. Although 
Bell said Florida is trying to seek more opportunities to place a portion of 
its $15 billion in pension funds with minority money managers, he gives only to 
those who have operated for at least three years. Other money managers require 
at least 10 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rules Limited Scope 
</P>
<P>
With offices in a 52-acre industrial park near Watts, the ERC Venture Capital 
Partnership seems an unlikely outpost for training venture capitalists. But 
Drummond, the 60-year-old chairman of the nonprofit Economic Resources Corp., 
said he believes that ERC's previous experience in arranging corporate debt 
financing as well as real estate development and leveraged buyouts will 
persuade investors that ERC is up to the task of managing tens of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond, Boyd and Lombard say their most important investment experience has 
come from operating ERC's Capital Fund, which lends money to minority 
businesses at fixed rates. Capitalized in 1984 at $1.7 million from federal 
government sources and a Ford Foundation grant, the fund has lent nearly $2.4 
million to 13 minority businesses. They include Royal Entertainment Inc., which 
operates the Baldwin Theater, and Medialink VAR Corp., a black-owned 
telecommunications firm. 
</P>
<P>
The fund has also helped syndicate an additional $10.5 million in loans to 
various minority businesses, including a $4.8-million loan package that enabled 
black entrepreneur James W. Norton to engineer a leveraged buyout of Argon 
Industries, a Los Angeles-based manufacturer of plastic products. 
</P>
<P>
The Capital Fund, however, operates under government and Ford Foundation rules 
that limit its scope and size, and therefore did not take equity positions in 
companies it financed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet ERC's banker, Barry W. Uzel, president of the National Bank of California 
who has worked with Drummond and Boyd for years, contends that "the skills 
learned (from debt financing) are more or less transferable to venture 
capital." He said he endorses ERC's move into the venture capital field. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond, a native of New York, developed his reputation as a successful 
businessman in the 1970s, when he headed his own broadcast investment firm and 
a liquor wholesale business which, at its peak in 1978, grossed $23 million and 
ranked among the top 10 largest black businesses in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Times Have Changed 
</P>
<P>
Since joining ERC six years ago as a director, Drummond has guided ERC's real 
estate division through its most active period of growth, including the 
construction of the Martin Luther King Shopping Center in Watts and the Century 
Terrace Condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
He will be assisted in managing the fund by Lombard, a former regional director 
of the Los Angeles brokerage firm Grubb &amp; Ellis, and by Boyd, who has held 
assistant vice president posts in the corporate financing divisions of Lloyd's 
Bank of California and First National Bank of Chicago's offices in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not 1965 anymore," said Drummond. "The government is cutting back on 
all different kinds of aid. If we want to play in the mainstream, we have to 
play where the mainstream is being played, venture financing. Unfortunately the 
MESBIC program has not been the great success that everybody wanted . . . . 
It's young guys like these (Boyd and Lombard) that are the best hope for our 
future."

CONFIDENCE IN ECONOMY RISES, SURVEY INDICATES

Consumers' confidence about the economy increased in December, boosted by low 
inflation, low unemployment and growth in personal income, a business-financed 
research organization reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index increased to 119.8, up nearly 
7 points from November, the board said in a report released today. The index 
had declined in November to 113.1 from October's figure of 116.9. 
</P>
<P>
Those surveyed were particularly positive about the current economic situation, 
the board said, with this component of the confidence index the highest since 
the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The monthly survey of 5,000 U.S. households is conducted for the board by 
National Family Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"The consumer's very favorable assessment of prevailing conditions reflects the 
continued vigor of the economy and bodes well for the immediate future," said 
Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's consumer research center. 
</P>
<P>
"Unemployment is at its lowest level in many years, personal income continues 
to grow, and the inflation rate is virtually imperceptible to the average 
shopper," he said. "All these factors contribute to a high level of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, there is some uncertainty about the future, with the policies of the 
new Administration on such major issues as the federal budget and the foreign 
trade deficits still unknown," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Buying plans remained at roughly the same level for the past few months, the 
board said. About 7% of respondents said they plan to purchase a car within six 
months, 3.5% intend to buy a home in the period and nearly 29% plan to buy a 
major appliance.

CABLE VIEWERS HAVE MORE CHANNELS -- BUT FOR A PRICE

Cable television systems are offering more channels to more viewers, but the 
price for watching is also going up. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years since most cable systems were freed from municipal rate 
regulation, their basic service rates have risen substantially. However, 
stability in premium channel rates, which were never regulated, has moderated 
the increase in the average overall cable bill. 
</P>
<P>
The consumer price index for the 12 months through November shows that cable TV 
bills for urban viewers rose 13.3%, while the overall index rose 4.2% during 
the period. The cable increase during the previous year was 6.85%. 
</P>
<P>
Other trackers of cable prices, however, show different figures. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel-based research firm that compiles nationwide 
cable prices, says the monthly rate for basic cable rose about 10%, from a 
monthly average of $13.20 last year to $14.52 in 1988. With premium channels 
added in, average monthly cable bills rose 5.6% over 1987 to $24.73, a rate 
only slightly higher than inflation, the firm says. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the industry say that for the two decades before deregulation took 
effect in January, 1987, municipalities kept basic service rates artificially 
low. With the freedom to charge what the market will bear, cable systems have 
added more channels to the basic tier and raised prices. 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Armbrust, a senior analyst at Kagan, said the trend in steep increases 
for basic service is a "two-year phenomenon" that already shows signs of 
stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
"Regular rates will track fairly closely with inflation and perhaps outpace it 
simply because of the new services" being added, Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be a consumer backlash if charges go up without new services, but 
cable operators are sensitive to this. It's a subscription service -- you vote 
every month whether to buy it," she said.

EMPLOYEE GROUP BUYS OUT IRVINE'S STERLING ELECTRIC

<TEXT>
<P>
A. O. Smith Corp. of Milwaukee announced Monday that it has sold its Sterling 
Electric Inc. subsidiary in Irvine to a group of Sterling employees including 
its president. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling President Raymond E. Helton headed the buyout team, according to the 
announcement. Terms were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Helton said in an interview that Sterling Electric manufactures power 
transmission equipment and electric motors for various companies, including 
Ford Motor Co. and several commercial food processing companies. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling was one of the first motor companies in the country when it was 
founded in 1927 in Los Angeles, he said. The company, which employs about 65, 
moved to Irvine in 1970. A. O. Smith, a diversified manufacturer, acquired 
Sterling in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Our charter for the first two or three years will be to service our 
customers," said Helton. He said the leveraged buyout was completed Dec. 31.

SHOWDOWN BETWEEN EASTERN, MACHINISTS STARTS FRIDAY

Eastern Airlines, smaller and deeper in debt than a year ago, begins 1989 
facing federal mediation considered crucial to what the carrier will look like 
a year from now -- if it still exists. 
</P>
<P>
"We simply cannot survive if the National Mediation Board persists in holding 
Eastern hostage as it has been doing," wrote Tom Matthews, Eastern's senior 
vice president for human resources, in a Dec. 28 letter to Walter C. Wallace, 
chairman of the mediation board. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace will participate Friday in mediation at an undisclosed location between 
Eastern and its Machinists union. The mediation sessions, with no deadline set 
by the federal board, are aimed at settling a 16-month-old contract dispute 
that has been before the board for a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Questions About Safety 
</P>
<P>
Failure to reach agreement could lead to the mediation board's declaration of 
an impasse. That would trigger a 30-day cooling-off period, after which the 
union could strike and Eastern could impose its own work conditions. 
</P>
<P>
While some union leaders suspect that the hard-line Texas Air Corp. ownership 
would like a strike so that it could try to break the strike and bust the 
union, the struggling airline might not last through disruptions and much more 
negative publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern ended the year with new public questions about its safety after an 
emergency landing Dec. 26 in Charleston, W.Va. of an Eastern flight with a hole 
in its fuselage. There were no injuries, and company officials say Eastern has 
one of the industry's best safety records. 
</P>
<P>
But the incident came after Eastern earlier in the year went through a 
comprehensive Federal Aviation Administration probe and Department of 
Transportation scrutiny. Those studies said Eastern was safe, but its unusually 
bad labor-management relations could threaten safety. 
</P>
<P>
Executives of Eastern's pilots union will meet early this month to discuss 
their contract talks, begun about six months ago, with management. The pilots 
are also hopeful that the National Mediation Board, which has set final briefs 
for early February, will agree with them that Eastern and its Texas Air sister, 
Continental Airlines, are being run as a single carrier. 
</P>
<P>
A single-carrier ruling could lead to unionization of Continental, to which 
Texas Air has transferred some Eastern assets because of its non-union status, 
the pilots union says. Eastern officials say Continental is run separately from 
Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots haven't said whether they would honor a Machinists strike. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still $200 Million Apart 
</P>
<P>
Since Machinists negotiations began, Eastern has laid off 7,233 employees, or 
about a fifth of its work force, and lost $319 million, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
It has been lobbying ardently for declaration of an impasse, bringing the 
30-day deadline that the company says will force movement in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern reported $233.7 million in losses for the first three quarters of 1988, 
and its loss for the past decade totals $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Management and its largest union, the 8,500-worker Machinists, are $200 million 
apart in their latest contract offers. But besides money, there are important 
philosophical differences between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan firmly believes that workers 
should have a major role in company decision making. His dream has been an 
employee-owned Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
The management of Eastern, bought nearly three years ago by Houston-based Texas 
Air, has been more interested in slashing the wages of the non-mechanics in the 
Machinists union. Mechanics make up about half the union, but the management 
says it must cut baggage handler and other non-mechanic wages. 
</P>
<P>
Some baggage handlers, for example, would have hourly wages cut over three 
years from $15.60 to $10. Mechanics would be cut only by small amounts. Union 
officials have described the company offer as a divide-and-conquer strategy to 
split the union between mechanics and the other workers. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern management also points out that Machinists refused to take the 20% 
salary cuts agreed to by its pilots and flight attendants unions in February, 
1986, in an effort to stave off bankruptcy or the sale to Texas Air. Machinists 
leaders say Eastern employees are being told to suffer even more for bad 
management that isn't committed to keeping Eastern alive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transfer of Assets 
</P>
<P>
The unions say Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo is stripping away Eastern's 
assets and will abandon a carcass. 
</P>
<P>
The $365-million sale of Eastern's profitable Northeast shuttle service to New 
York developer Donald J. Trump and the earlier spinoff of Eastern's computer 
reservations system to Texas Air are cited to support that argument. Planes and 
gates have also been sold, and Eastern reportedly has been offering other 
assets such as Canadian routes. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern says it needs cash infusions to keep operating. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan, who portrays his union's resistance to Lorenzo as a virtual holy war, 
has sought a "white knight" to rescue Eastern employees and allow them to take 
over the airline. But the only reported serious talks last year about buying 
Eastern were with TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn, who wanted steep union 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
In a Nov. 9 letter to Bryan, Lorenzo, who hadn't deigned to communicate 
directly with Bryan until recent months, said the contract negotiations were 
the most realistic way to help the airline. 
</P>
<P>
"Time is running against Eastern," Lorenzo wrote.

AS CRASH OF '87 RECEDES, GAINERS OUTPACE LOSERS 3 TO 2 ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF 
ISSUES IN 1988 STOCK SCOREBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Stocks of companies based in the San Fernando Valley joined the overall market 
in moving mostly higher last year, a sharp turnaround from 1987 when losing 
Valley issues outpaced gainers by more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, three Valley stocks rose for every two that declined, and the top 
performers came from a diverse list of industries, from high-technology 
concerns and banks to a car-wheel maker and an operator of art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
The stocks suffering big setbacks in 1988 also were varied, with real estate 
developers joining computer and entertainment concerns in the loss column. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 30 out of the 47 local stocks that began the year at $3 a share or 
higher ended 1988 with gains, while 16 fell and one was unchanged. Among the 
advancing issues were 19 that jumped 30% or more in price. The data was 
compiled for The Times by Communications Research Group in Austin, Tex., and 
includes stocks of companies with headquarters from Glendale to Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Advance 
</P>
<P>
The broader market ended 1988 with a sizable if not spectacular advance. The 
Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks climbed 229.74 to 2,168.57, or 11.9%, 
within striking distance of its post-crash high of 2,183.50. For all of 1987, 
the average inched up only 2.3%, largely due to the Oct. 19 stock market crash. 
The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks gained 30.64 to 277.72, 
or 12.4%, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard for Valley area stocks last year included some notable rebounds 
and some sharp setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, United Education &amp; Software led 1987's list of winners with a 
142% gain. But last year, the Encino operator of trade schools suffered major 
problems with another subsidiary that serviced student loans, and by year's 
end, UES had shed the business. In the meantime, UES' stock skidded 56% for 
1988, to $3.63 a share, making it the second-biggest loser among Valley stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser, Chatsworth disk-drive maker Micropolis, likewise had come 
off a strong 1987, when its stock rose 25%. But last year the company, hampered 
by high production costs, suffered major losses and its stock plunged 68% to 
$7.38 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Big Winners 
</P>
<P>
But some other high-technology stocks fared well. The area's biggest gainer was 
Tekelec, a Calabasas producer of testing equipment for telecommunications 
systems, whose stock nearly quadrupled to close at $15.50 a share. The company 
reported steadily improving earnings in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Delphi Information Systems, a Westlake Village producer of computer systems for 
the insurance industry, also enjoyed a rebound in earnings. Its stock jumped 
154% to $8.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
And the stock of Datron Systems in Simi Valley, which makes communications 
systems for defense and aerospace customers, doubled last year, to $10.50 a 
share. Among other things, Datron reported a 65% surge in profit for its fiscal 
year that ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln Bancorp's stock also rode strong earnings growth at the Encino-based 
bank holding company to more than double in price to $15.63 a share. Consistent 
profit gains at Superior Industries, a Van Nuys manufacturer of wheels for the 
Big Three auto makers, also helped Superior's stock double to $19.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Lawrence Limited Editions, a Van Nuys operator of art galleries, 
likewise posted big profit gains, with net income for the first 9 months of 
1988 doubling from a year earlier. The result: Martin Lawrence's stock rose 93% 
last year to $9.88 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fueled by Takeover 
</P>
<P>
The takeover mania on Wall Street last year also spilled over to some Valley 
area companies, naturally boosting their stocks. AME, a Burbank company that 
provides videotape services for the entertainment industry, rose 68% to $13 
after AME's chairman and founder, Andrew M. McIntyre, offered to buy the 56% of 
AME that he doesn't already own for $13.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Cherokee Group, a Sunland apparel maker, has agreed to be acquired for $14 a 
share in cash and securities by Green Acquisition, an investor group that 
includes three top Cherokee executives. Cherokee's stock also ended the year at 
$13 a share, up 65%. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land &amp; Farming, a Valencia real-estate partnership that is among 
California's biggest landowners, has ownership units that trade like shares of 
stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Last year, Newhall successfully urged its 
unit holders to pass anti-takeover provisions, but last week rumors of a 
management-led buyout drove the units higher and the unit closed at $56.63, up 
89% for the year. Newhall declined comment on the rumors, but said it could not 
account for the unit's sharp rise. 
</P>
<P>
House of Fabrics, a Sherman Oaks operator of fabric stores, also was the 
subject of takeover rumors at year's end, giving its stock a 46% gain for 1988 
to $21.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poor Performers 
</P>
<P>
Just as the list of Valley winners was peppered with companies showing strong 
earnings, so too was the list of losers dominated by companies that showed poor 
profits or outright losses. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Micropolis and United Education, Olson Industries saw its stock 
slide under the weight of the company's poor performance. Olson, a Sherman Oaks 
manufacturer of plastic packaging products that has been hurt by high raw 
materials prices, lost $3.1 million in the first 9 months of 1988. Its stock 
finished the year down 50% at $4.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The stock of Alpharel, a Camarillo maker of computer data storage equipment 
that has been struggling because of weak orders, fell 54% to $1.38 a share. 
Valley Federal Savings &amp; Loan in Van Nuys, which also has posted poor 
results, fell 24% to $13.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotel Earnings Drop 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel Investors Corp., a Woodland Hills real estate 
investment trust and hotel management concern whose shares trade as one, 
reported a combined 58% earnings drop for the first 9 months of 1988 and 
slashed the stock's dividend in half in November. Investors weren't pleased; 
Hotel Investors stock fell 39% for the year to $9.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Some stocks that began the year at less than $3 a share also gained notice. 
</P>
<P>
HOH Water Technology, a Newbury Park company that is developing a 
water-purification system, began that year at 50 cents a share but finished at 
$3.09, a sixfold increase. Flamemaster, a Sun Valley manufacturer of coatings 
and sealants that also was approached by unidentified parties about a possible 
merger, more than tripled to $6.75 a share. And Nu-Med, an Encino hospital 
operator that had been struggling, enjoyed a 173% surge in its stock to $5.13 a 
share.

FIRST PERSON: SLOW JOURNEY BACK FROM THE DARKNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I was on top of the world when it happened: An A-minus student. About to 
graduate from Stanford. Editor of the school paper and looking forward to a 
reporting job on a newspaper or magazine. 
</P>
<P>
At least, that's what my family and friends tell me. 
</P>
<P>
I have only a shadowy perception of the old me, an image built on the memories 
of others. Often I wonder what I was really like and how much I changed in 
those moments my brain was deprived of oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
The date was March 29, 1984, three days after my 21st birthday. I'd flown to 
Honolulu with close friends for a pre-graduation spree and birthday 
celebration. My boyfriend and I had a drink at a beachside bar, then headed for 
a hot, packed disco. 
</P>
<P>
There, we elbowed our way to the bar and ordered another drink. We'd taken only 
a sip or two, when "99 Luftballoons" came blaring over the 10-foot speakers and 
my boyfriend led me through the crowd and onto the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
I don't remember what happened next, but I do know the following few moments 
changed my life. Those nearby say I began dancing out of control, my arms 
swinging wildly, my mind fixed on a beat apparently only I heard. Embarrassed, 
my boyfriend reached out to grab me when I fell to the floor and began 
convulsing. 
</P>
<P>
After my boyfriend screamed for help, two quick-thinking employees began 
administering CPR and someone called the paramedics. Arriving a few minutes 
later, they pressed defibrillator paddles against my heart in a desperate 
attempt to restart it. I was rushed to the nearest hospital in a comatose 
state. But at least my heart was beating again. 
</P>
<P>
What caused such sudden cardiac failure? 
</P>
<P>
As drugs were not detected in my bloodstream, doctors began extensive tests, 
hoping to pinpoint the cause. Today, they still don't know the answer and tell 
me it was a weird fluke, one that should not happen again. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Heart Assn.'s most recent statistics, it is extremely 
unlikely that a 21-year-old woman will experience what I did; only 0.7%, ages 
29 to 44, suffered cardiac arrest in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later, I emerged from a coma, a rare statistic. Once the respiration 
tubes were removed from my throat, however, it became apparent that something 
was seriously wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to leave now," I announced, repeating myself every five seconds or 
so. Bewildered, confused and determined to leave the hospital, I had to be 
strapped to the bed with oversized rubber band-like restraints. I recognized 
few of my friends and even had trouble distinguishing my mom and dad. 
</P>
<P>
I remained in intensive care for two weeks. During that time my parents, an 
older brother and friends attempted to fill me in on the details of a life I 
didn't remember. But their words were wasted because I remembered little from 
minute to minute. 
</P>
<P>
When my heart rhythm appeared stable, I was flown to a Los Angeles hospital. 
There, I underwent seven more weeks of testing to determine the cause of the 
incident and to evaluate my mental condition. 
</P>
<P>
I was extraordinarily confused. Reading simple words or adding two and two was 
more than I could do. 
</P>
<P>
So every day I had therapy. I struggled to learn to add and subtract or read 
about Dick and Jane. Even more difficult was learning to remember what I'd read 
only two minutes before. The progress was very slow, because I had almost no 
short-term memory. Today, my short-term memory is much improved but still 
slightly diminished. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's for the best that I was confused about my situation. Had I 
remembered my former self, I would undoubtedly have been far more frustrated by 
my lack of progress, and far more embarrassed by my actions. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, there were many times when I'd just sit on the floor in tears, 
wondering when I would be myself again. 
</P>
<P>
When I was released from the hospital in May of 1984, my heart was -- and still 
is -- stabilized by medication. I spent the summer at my parents' house trying 
to improve my reading and memory in preparation for my return to Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Back at school, I chose classes without in-class exams to avoid overtaxing my 
ability to remember. Even so, school was a completely different experience for 
me. Previously, I'd almost always earned A's and Bs. Now I was getting Cs and 
Ds. 
</P>
<P>
My already diminished attention span was made worse by the medication 
prescribed to calm severe body spasms, another result of the lack of blood flow 
to the brain. I fought through the classes and nights of spasms. And, aching 
inside, I made excuses for my poor grades. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing school in April of 1985, I began work as an intern in the Los 
Angeles bureau of Newsweek. It was the first of a string of unsuccessful 
reporting jobs. At each publication I had the same problem: Even though I 
thought I was doing a good job, I wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
I was told my stories were choppy, my reporting skills weak. After being fired 
from a medium-sized newspaper in Southern California, I went to work for a 
small business publication. But history repeated itself, and after a month I 
quit, having come to the realization that I no longer possessed skills 
essential to a reporter: organizing and analyzing information. 
</P>
<P>
Today, I still remember very little about my stay in Hawaii. And I still wonder 
how I appear to those who knew the old me. I really only know what I think of 
myself now -- and that is something that's constantly changing. 
</P>
<P>
I work as an editorial assistant at the Los Angeles Times, a fairly 
straightforward job that allows me to assume increasing amounts of 
responsibility and build confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Though I know I should be happy simply to be working, I still feel frustrated 
and embarrassed in some social situations or when I talk to my friends who are 
now reporters. Because they know of my past ambitions, it's not always easy to 
tell them I work as a clerk. 
</P>
<P>
It's at times like that I have to remind myself that only 4 1/2 years ago I was 
learning to read again.

The Pentagon said today that 13 U.S. warships with 2,000 assault Marines and 
amphibious landing gear are headed for the Mediterranean on routine deployment, 
but officials refused to rule out any American attack against an alleged 
chemical weapons plant in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to speculate in that area (a possible attack) at all," Defense 
Department spokesman Dan Howard told reporters in response to questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything you're talking about falls into the general area of classified 
information and I cannot discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Reagan revealed that the United States had discussed with 
NATO allies possible military action against a chemical plant in Libya that 
Washington believes is intended to produce deadly chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Theodore Roosevelt, the newest U.S. nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, left 
Norfolk, Va., Friday for the Mediterranean, where the John F. Kennedy carrier 
battle group already is on duty, a Navy spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of Reagan's comments, the Roosevelt's movement took on added 
significance and raised speculation that its departure might be linked to 
Libya. But a Navy statement insisted the departure of the Roosevelt was "a 
routine deployment" planned "many, many months ago." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peace Groups Protest 
</P>
<P>
However, in Rome, peace groups, left-wing political parties and Vatican radio 
protested the Navy deployment. The Italian Assn. for Peace called on the 
Italian Parliament to declare the nation's ports and naval bases "unavailable 
to U.S. Navy ships and military aircraft and in any case to ban their entry 
into Italian territorial waters and airspace." 
</P>
<P>
Vatican radio said news of the deployment "has created alarm about the 
possibility of new tension between the United States and Libya." 
</P>
<P>
The Roosevelt's 12-ship battle group includes two cruisers, six destroyers, a 
frigate and three auxiliary ships. In addition, the group is accompanied by 
five amphibious landing ships of the Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group. 
</P>
<P>
Navy Cmdr. Steve Burnett said about 2,000 of the 4,100 Marines aboard the five 
vessels are assault troops. 
</P>
<P>
An almost identical force of Marines and amphibious landing vehicles, also part 
of the Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group, is accompanying the Kennedy battle 
group -- meaning a total of 4,000 assault Marines will be in the area with the 
arrival of the Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy said the Roosevelt will take about a week to reach the Mediterranean, 
where there are already 23 U.S. warships, and Howard said, "It is not unusual 
for us to have an overlap (of carriers) in the Mediterranean." 
</P>
<P>
However, Howard refused to rule out whether the ship movements would be 
affected by the Libyan situation and he said he did not know how long the two 
carriers would remain in the Mediterranean together. 
</P>
<P>
Howard referred questions about the alleged Libyan chemical plant to the State 
Department, declining to say whether military photographs of the plant had 
proven the facility was built solely for chemical weapons production.

Lawyers for former White House aide Oliver L. North have issued subpoenas for 
Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other top State Department officials to 
testify in the trial arising from the Iran-Contra affair, the State Department 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan and President-elect George Bush have already been served with 
similar subpoenas. Their aides have indicated that they would refuse to testify 
on constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Shultz would appear if that 
were deemed necessary "by the parties and the court." She said other State 
officials subpoenaed included Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary for 
inter-American affairs; Michael Armacost, undersecretary for political affairs; 
Charles Hill, Shultz's executive assistant, and department legal adviser 
Abraham Soafer.

Chrysler Corp. said today it plans to introduce a 10-cylinder engine in the 
early 1990s, the first built by a U.S. auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
A version of the engine will be shown later this week at the North American 
Automobile Show in Detroit on the Dodge Viper RT-10 concept car, said Thomas 
Gale, vice president of product design. Although the engine is not yet 
available on production models, Gale said he expects to see it used on Formula 
One racing cars soon and on Chrysler truck models in the early 1990s. The 
engine probably will be produced at a Chrysler engine plant in Detroit, he 
said.

The last guests bade farewell to the 68-year-old Wilshire Boulevard landmark, 
an imposing building on 23 lush acres now in disrepair. It was one of the 
city's first luxury hotels, its palm-lined property exemplifying the California 
life style. The site's future is uncertain, with two companies negotiating to 
buy it, hotel spokeswoman Margaret Burk said. The estimated sale price has 
risen above $100 million, with preservation of some or all of the building

Foreign Minister Moshe Arens complained today that European countries are not 
consulting Israel about Middle East peace steps and said Israel is ready to 
suffer isolation from the world for the sake of security. 
</P>
<P>
In the new foreign minister's first news conference with foreign 
correspondents, Arens said that Israel does not approve of the European 
Community's plan, announced Monday, to start a Middle East peace initiative by 
encouraging an international conference on the region. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be better if prior to undertaking any kind of initiative, the 
members of the European Community were to meet with us, were to consult with 
us, were to coordinate with us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Arens, 63, a former ambassador to the United States, also renewed Israel's 
criticism that the U.S. decision to hold talks with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization was damaging the fight against international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Arens became foreign minister with the formation of Israel's new government on 
Dec. 22. He is a member of the Likud Party of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, 
which has opposed an international Middle East peace conference. 
</P>
<P>
Arens said his government does not welcome isolation but must think first of 
security. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not be expected to take any step that might decrease the sense of 
isolation . . . if they are steps that would endanger the state of Israel," 
Arens told the Foreign Press Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lova Eliav, a member of the center-left Labor Party, said today that 
he and three other Israeli parliament members will attend a European symposium 
this month on Middle East peace with PLO representatives despite Israel's ban 
on meetings with PLO members. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to speak to the Palestinians directly and reach peace with them 
through compromise," Eliav said. "The more we speak the better."

DUKAKIS WON'T SEEK 4TH TERM IN MASS.;

Gov. Michael S. Dukakis announced today that he will not seek election in 1990 
to another term in the Massachusetts Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be my last term as governor of Massachusetts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The three-term Democrat, the unsuccessful 1988 presidential candidate, gave no 
immediate indication of his long-term plans, including whether he will drop out 
of politics altogether or seek the presidency again in 1992. He said he will 
announce further plans later this week. 
</P>
<P>
He said he intends to spend the next two years fulfilling his responsibilities 
and wrapping up his programs. 
</P>
<P>
Dukakis said his loss in the presidential race had little impact on his 
decision. Even if he had not run for President, he probably would have decided 
not to seek a fourth four-year term, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Dukakis had been urged by fellow Democrats to announce his 
plans so they could begin making their political plans for the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
"One has to make a decision; I've made that decision," he said. "It seemed to 
me desirable to make the decision now, rather than later," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Asked for a hint to his future plans, Dukakis would say only: "Public policy 
and public service is what I'm all about; it's what I love." 
</P>
<P>
At age 55, Dukakis is midway through his third four-year term as governor of 
Massachusetts. If he completes his current term, he will have served longer as 
the state's governor than any of his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, speculation has mounted about Dukakis and his plans, with some 
saying he would seek a rematch with Bush in 1992 or would run for governor 
again or would drop out of politics for some sort of academic position. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent poll, Dukakis appeared to enjoy a commanding 67% to 27% lead in 
popularity statewide over such a likely Democratic challenger as Boston Mayor 
Raymond Flynn.

saying it does not believe area teachers' claims that they would abandon their 
pupils in an atomic emergency.

<P>
In a 290-page decision dated Friday and released today, a panel of three 
administrative law judges said there is "reasonable assurance that adequate 
protective measures can and will be taken within the New Hampshire portion" of 
a 10-mile evacuation zone around the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the zone lies in Massachusetts, which has to cooperate in the planning 
for an evacuation.

The plant's operator, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, has submitted a plan 
for Massachusetts communities, but the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board panel 
of law judges has yet to hold a hearing on it.

Italy, which a year ago triumphantly announced it had overtaken Britain as the 
world's fifth-largest Western economic power, has slipped back into sixth 
place, according to the latest data from the National Statistics Institute 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's gross domestic product, the broad measure of the goods and services a 
country produces excluding its foreign income, fell behind Britain's in 1986, 
the latest year for which data is available, after having edged ahead in 1985 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The first four places in the league table were occupied by the United States, 
Japan, West Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's brief success in toppling Britain from its fifth place in the 
international league table was due mainly to an 18% jump in its GDP in 1985 as 
the institute attempted to incorporate the booming hidden economy into official 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
But the recalculation was criticized by some politicians and newspapers because 
boosting the official GDP risked forcing an increase in Italy's contributions 
to the European Community budget and reducing its eligibility for regional EC 
aid.

Chrysler Corp. said today that it plans to introduce a 10-cylinder engine in 
the early 1990s, the first built by a U.S. auto maker. A version of the engine 
will be shown later this week at the North American Automobile Show in Detroit

While the engine is not yet available on production models, Gale said he

Trade publications have previously reported speculation about the V-10 engine 
program, but Chrysler had not confirmed the reports. 
</P>
<P>
Gale said the engine probably will be introduced on Chrysler truck models in 
the early 1990s but he declined to be more specific. Ronald Glantz, an 
automotive analyst with Montgomery Securities, said the engine will be used 
"mainly in motor homes and medium trucks, and they will probably make a version 
of it for Lamborghini." Chrysler bought the Italian sports car manufacturer in 
1987.

San Francisco 49ers assistant coach Dennis Green today was named head football 
coach at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who will be the fourth black head coach among the nation's 104 Division 
I schools, replaces Jack Elway, fired last month after a lackluster 3-6-2 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Andy Geiger conducted a four-week search and interviewed more 
than a dozen candidates, including Paul Hackett, pass offense coordinator of 
the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Pete Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased that we were able to lure Dennis Green back to the college 
football ranks," said Gieger in a release distributed moments before a news 
conference to announce the selection. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been at Stanford as an assistant twice, under two different head coaches, 
and I really feel it's an outstanding job," said Green, 39, a few days before 
the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Green was an assistant at Stanford under Bill Walsh, his present boss with San 
Francisco, in 1977 and 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He served as running backs coach for Walsh's first 49ers coaching staff in 1979 
and then returned to Stanford as offensive coordinator under Paul Wiggin in 
1980 before accepting the head coaching job at Northwestern in 1981 at the age 
of 31. He was named Big 10 Coach of the Year in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who said he would continue with San Francisco until the season ends, 
started working Monday to assemble a staff. 
</P>
<P>
Green, a tailback at Iowa who played in the Canadian Football League, said he 
plans to meet with Stanford players when they return to campus next week. 
</P>
<P>
Elway was dismissed Dec. 5 amid reports of player dissatisfaction. The 
Cardinals had losing seasons in four of Elway's five years with the school. He 
was 25-29-2 overall.

Canadian immigration officials said today that a teen-age Czechoslovak hockey 
player, who failed to leave with his teammates after an international 
tournament, wants to remain in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Wilf Lindner, manager of Canada Employment and Immigration, said that 
17-year-old Peter Nedved is staying with unidentified people in Calgary and 
that his department is satisfied he is "being looked after." 
</P>
<P>
Lindner said Nedved, who was interviewed by department officials on Monday, had 
not yet claimed refugee status in Canada and would be interviewed again in a 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
"In all of these cases, we try to give the person sufficient time to get his 
bearings before bombarding him with questions," he told Canadian Press. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the tournament said on Monday night that Nedved was not aboard a 
plane that took 29 players and coaches of the Czechoslovak team back to 
Litvinov, a community of 35,000.

Vreni Schneider of Switzerland won her sixth World Cup race of the season today 
and became a clear favorite to dominate the World Alpine Skiing Championships 
at Vail, Colo., in 25 days. 
</P>
<P>
While Schneider won a women's slalom, her third of the season, and appears in 
top form for Jan. 29-Feb. 12 in Vail, American Tamara McKinney was third and 
also could be heard from at the world championships. 
</P>
<P>
But Schneider, the 24-year-old double Olympic gold medalist who looks to be 
well on her way toward capturing the 1988-89 World Cup, was cautious not to 
accept premature laurels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not thinking of ultimate victory because there are still a lot of 
races left until the end of the season. I still remember last year's injury," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, when she captured the Olympic slalom and giant slalom titles, she 
led the World Cup standings until she had a bad spill in a race at Aspen, 
Colo., and tore ligaments in her left knee. 
</P>
<P>
Second in today's race, held in dense fog, was Austrian Monika Maierhofer, in 
1:23.81.

Minnesota Vikings defensive end Al Baker said he will appeal a $10,000 fine by 
the National Football League for a late hit on Chicago quarterback Mike Tomczak 
in the last game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Monday that he's asked for a hearing before NFL Commissioner Pete 
Rozelle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really shocked and I'm pretty disappointed in the way it was handled 
because it wasn't intentional," said Baker, who has lost $30,000 in fines and 
salary this season. "If he (Rozelle) reviewed the film, he could see it wasn't 
flagrant. Maybe he was trying to make an example out of me. And I frown on 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Rozelle suspended Baker for one game without pay for punching 
Philadelphia Eagles tackle Ron Heller in the eye during a game Sept. 25. That 
suspension cost Baker a week's pay, or about $20,000.
