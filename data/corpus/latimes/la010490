IT'S A SCRAMBLE: 4 MORE DAYS TO SEE FABERGE EGGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Forkes came all the way from Milwaukee to see the Faberge eggs. Margie 
Bylsma came from Cyprus. Charles Westgate came from Boston and Ilene Beber from 
Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
None of them minded waiting outside in a brisk wind Wednesday for at least half 
an hour to get a final peek at "Faberge: The Imperial Eggs," a show that closes 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Forkes, Bylsma, Westgate and Beber are among the more than 200,000 visitors 
(205,000 at the close of business Wednesday) who have trekked to see the eggs 
since the exhibit opened Oct. 22. Mardi Snow, spokeswoman for the San Diego 
Museum of Art, said the Faberge showing is, by far, the most successful in the 
history of the gallery, averaging crowds of up to 2,500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
For prices cheaper than a movie -- $5 per adult, with one child free when 
accompanied by a grown-up -- the lines have been long, even when the weather 
has occasionally been dreadful and despite some sniping from critics 
questioning whether the eggs are truly art. 
</P>
<P>
But those interviewed on Wednesday were generally thrilled with the display. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannine Manson of Rancho Santa Fe said: "I'm impressed with the display. I 
think it's excellent. But I would like to see much better crowd control once 
you're in here. Someone should be directing the flow inside, especially to help 
with the elderly. A lot of them just get elbowed out, and I don't think that's 
fair. It actually means more to them than it does to some of the younger 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those interviewed Wednesday acknowledged that they're no connoisseurs 
of art. Many had seen the bad reviews and said, "Who cares?" They felt more, 
not less, determined to gawk at the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
As Betty Wunschel from Long Beach put it, "Most critics don't know what they're 
talking about. We start listening to them, we're really in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Most said they bought tickets far in advance through Ticketmaster outlets. The 
tickets assigned them a designated hour to show up, and the waits, according to 
those polled Wednesday, were never more than 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Snow said chances for seeing the exhibit in its four remaining days 
are not good. As of now, Saturday and Sunday are sold out, and few tickets 
remain for today and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Museum officials have declined to say either how much the exhibit cost or how 
much it has made. City administration sources note, however, that, despite the 
crowds, the eggs have yet to reach the break-even point and probably won't. 
</P>
<P>
Snow said thousands of San Diego eeCounty students have seen the eggs free. She 
said the only real problems came when the showing first opened. Waits were 
longer then, and the expensive security for the 27 eggs may, at times, have 
been too good. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had no security problems, knock on wood," Snow said. "But, at first, 
the cases were wired so tight that, when people pressed against the glass, the 
alarms sometimes went off. So, we've turned down the calibrations a few 
notches. Uh-oh. Do you have to say we turned down the notches?" 
</P>
<P>
The museum would love to extend the exhibit, but no luck, she said. It travels 
intact from San Diego to the Kremlin, where it opens a three-month run at the 
end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
Many in Wednesday's crowd cited glasnost as the reason they were eager to ogle 
the eggs. They spoke in hushed tones of recent events in Romania and 
Czechoslovakia and East Germany, and said the eggs gave them a chance, albeit 
small, of "sharing a piece of history." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Forkes, a music writer from Milwaukee, said he didn't know what a Faberge 
egg was until a recent episode of TV's "Mr. Belvedere." He said most people 
wanted to see the exhibit because they have glasnost "on the brain." 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Belvedere's grandson sold Mr. Belvedere's Faberge egg for $15, and that's 
the first time I'd heard of them," Forkes said. "My brother lives here, so when 
I heard this showing was at the art museum, I decided to give it a whirl while 
visiting my brother. I got here at 10:15 (a.m.), bought my tickets and waited 
in line 10 minutes before the 1 o'clock show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little too crowded inside here, but I've gotten a pretty good look at 
them, and people are pretty courteous for the most part, more than they would 
be in Chicago or Milwaukee. I'm awed by the detail and the craftsmanship of the 
work. But it's hard to believe so few people could spend so much money on stuff 
like this. No wonder it made people mad." 
</P>
<P>
About that time, a woman peering in at the Trans-Siberian Railway Egg, her 
fingers pressed against the glass of the case, said, "I wonder if you could rev 
it up, so that it would chug-chug like a little train?" 
</P>
<P>
San Diegan Joseph Pejsa said he had resented Mayor Maureen O'Connor "almost 
forcing the exhibit on us," but, once inside, he found it "stimulating, 
exhilarating, exquisite. I am ashamed, however, of these people who insist on 
smashing their fingers or faces against the glass and leaving smudges. I'm able 
to see these things from 4 or 5 feet away, so why can't they?" 
</P>
<P>
JoAnn Humphrey, president of the Academy for Holistic Education in La Jolla, 
marveled at the exhibit for "taking us into another age. Family photographs 
placed in an album are often forgotten in later years, but these eggs were a 
marvelous way of preserving likenesses and photographs." 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these people were murdered in the revolution, but even their killers 
were reluctant to destroy the eggs," Humphrey said. "There's one egg that has a 
cuckoo that comes out. There's another with a ship transporting tiny people on 
an undulating sea. There's a train with a caboose, which has tiny windows and 
glass that reflects. 
</P>
<P>
"I disagree with the critics. You have to define what art is. Does it inspire 
certain feelings? Does it preserve a time? These eggs do both of those things. 
The time was sentimental, romantic, ornamental. All of these are very elegant, 
very creative pieces. I think they're terrific."

CONFUSION COULD BE WINNER OF ELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: EVEN POLITICAL EXPERTS ARE BEMUSED BY THE POTENTIAL FOR COMPLICATIONS 
IN BALLOTING TO FILL LUCY KILLEA'S FORMER ASSEMBLY SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Setting the stage for a potentially confusing June ballot that could include 
two races for the same seat, Gov. George Deukmejian on Wednesday scheduled 
April 10 as the date for a special primary to fill the former Assembly seat of 
newly elected state Sen. Lucy Killea. 
</P>
<P>
If no candidate achieves the 50%-plus victory needed to win election outright 
in April, the top Democratic and Republican vote-getters would compete in a 
special June 5 runoff for the remaining seven months in Killea's unexpired term 
in the 78th District. 
</P>
<P>
On the same June ballot, the same candidates also could compete in the normal 
state legislative primary for their parties' nomination for the two-year term 
that will be contested in November. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, not only could there be two 78th-District elections on the June 
ballot, but it also is possible -- though politically unlikely -- that the 
winner of the special runoff could be defeated in the normal primary. 
</P>
<P>
If that sounds confusing, you're not the only one scratching your head. As an 
election supervisor in the registrar of voters office aptly put it: "This thing 
could be a real zoo." 
</P>
<P>
While consolidation of the special race's runoff with the June primary would 
save the county an estimated $200,000, it also creates the prospect of a rare 
double election that is as intriguing as it is perplexing. Indeed, county 
Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack conceded Wednesday that the juxtaposition 
of a special runoff and a routine primary for the same seat on the same ballot 
could befuddle many voters in June, adding wryly: "We're still trying to figure 
it out ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
"When people see the same names twice on the ballot, there's naturally going to 
be some confusion," McCormack said. "We've got a lot of education to do -- 
including with our own poll workers. Whatever happens, this probably is going 
to be one for the election books." 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly vacancy was created by Democrat Killea's upset victory in last 
month's special 39th state Senate District election, a race that drew national 
attention as a referendum on abortion and how far Catholic Church leaders may 
go in opposing it. Bishop Leo T. Maher had denied Killea Communion because of 
her pro-choice stand. The district stretches along the coast from Ocean Beach 
to Pacific Beach, extending inland to the Miramar Naval Air Station in the 
north, south to downtown San Diego and east to East San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
A conclusive primary victory in April would preclude much of the potential for 
confusion in June by eliminating the need for a runoff, meaning that only the 
normal GOP and Democratic primaries would be on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
However, with at least four major candidates -- Democrats Byron Georgiou, Mike 
Gotch and Howard Wayne, and Republican Jeff Marston -- expected to compete in 
the primary, the chance of any surpassing the 50% margin needed to avoid a 
runoff is unlikely. Hence the likelihood of June's "double election." 
</P>
<P>
One particularly fascinating potential posed by the unusual electoral schedule 
involves the possibility of a split decision, with one candidate winning the 
special election but losing the normal primary. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the two contests will be waged before markedly different 
constituencies -- all voters would cast ballots in the special runoff, while 
partisan electorates will decide the primaries -- increases the slim chance 
that the two races will have different victors. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a bizarre possibility, but a conceivable one," McCormack said. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic candidate Wayne, however, already has taken steps to try to ensure 
that that unusual happenstance does not occur. In a letter sent this week to 
Gotch and Georgiou, Wayne proposed that the Democrats who lose in April unite 
behind the primary victor in order that he "not be forced to fight a war on two 
fronts." 
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that the Democrat who wins in the (special) primary . . . not 
be required to beat the Republican in the runoff and to refight the Democratic 
field for the primary nomination," said Wayne, a deputy state attorney general. 
"Any other course of action means that the judgment of those who vote in April 
can be ignored by an intransigent candidate. . . Furthermore, such divisiveness 
would play directly into the hands of the Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
Georgiou on Wednesday endorsed Wayne's proposal, saying that it "makes good 
political sense." Gotch, a former two-term San Diego City Council member 
regarded as the early front-runner because of his superior name recognition, 
could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's technically possible that you might have two different winners, but not 
very likely," said Georgiou, the former legal affairs secretary to then-Gov. 
Edmund G. Brown Jr. "If we can all agree that the winner in April will get the 
others' support in June, it's even less likely. Besides, if you can't win in 
April, why would you be the party's best choice for the next two years?"

SUIT CLAIMS ZOO UNFAIR TO WOMEN JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A senior animal keeper who has worked at the San Diego Zoo for 15 years has 
filed suit against her employer, alleging that her superiors have discriminated 
against her because she is a Jewish woman. 
</P>
<P>
In a civil suit filed in September, Susan Krinsk, a senior keeper in the zoo's 
mammal department, alleged that she had been denied several promotions solely 
because of her sex and religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint, which also includes a class-action claim, says the zoo "follows 
a course and policy of refusing to promote women. . . . Such conduct was 
malicious and oppressive, motivated by a cruel hatred of plaintiff and her 
status as a woman and a Jewish person." 
</P>
<P>
In an answer filed in November, attorneys for the zoo denied Krinsk's 
allegations, saying she had failed to state facts sufficient to merit her 
complaint. According to Jeff Jouett, a spokesman for the zoo, 64 of the zoo's 
145 keepers are women; among the zoo's 37 mammal keepers, 12 are women. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo has no records of its employees' religious affiliations, Jouett said. 
But last month, in response to Krinsk's lawsuit, zoo employees received memos 
that asked them to identify their sex, religion and the department they work 
in, but not to include their names. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot comment on any litigation in progress," Jouett said Wednesday. "But I 
will say this: the zoo does not discriminate, not on the basis of religion or 
sex or race or national origin or age or marital status or any other irrelevant 
criteria." 
</P>
<P>
Krinsk, 36, who is responsible for the care and maintenance of 40 animals in 
the zoo's Dog and Cat Canyon area, says Jouett is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, the zoo posted an opening for five lead keeper positions in the 
mammals department. Krinsk thought that her experience and her degree in animal 
behavior would make her a strong candidate for the supervisory job, so she 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
The zoo refused to interview Krinsk and gave four of the positions to men who 
were less qualified than Krinsk, her suit claims. The fifth position was given 
to a woman who Krinsk claims is also less qualified. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur H. Skola, Krinsk's attorney, said he believes Krinsk is a victim of 
subtle double standards. 
</P>
<P>
"A defense the zoo will offer is that she exhibited behavior traits that appear 
negatively in her evaluations," Skola said. "But those very character traits in 
a man would be positive rather than negative. They perceive her as pushy and 
bossy because she speaks up. If the behavior was exhibited by a man, it would 
be seen as assertive and forceful -- good qualities." 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Krinsk says the zoo is punishing her for filing suit. In January, 
after eight years of having at least one weekend day off each week, she has 
been shifted to two weekdays off -- despite the fact that only five people have 
worked in the mammal department longer than she has. 
</P>
<P>
"I love this zoo. I have tried so hard to make it here. But there's no chance," 
she said. "I'm being harassed right now." 
</P>
<P>
Krinsk says she believes her religion has been a factor in her bosses' minds as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard the word JAP several times," she said, referring to the derogatory 
slang term for Jewish American princess.

AL MARTINEZ: TRUCK STOP BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every once in awhile I weary of the timid collations that characterize L.A.'s 
pretentious Westside bistros and long for a place that serves chili on its 
eggs. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want no foie de veau and I don't want ecrevisse de mer. I wanna dig 
into a mess o' beans and greasy bacon with coffee strong enough to run an 
18-wheeler, and then maybe have a chunk of brown banana pie. 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, I can't explain why, I get this urge right in the middle of my 
aspic salad to say to hell with the bistro and chow down where the truckers 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
That is not to say they necessarily eat better than everyone else, but there is 
a kind of reality to a truck stop restaurant one does not feel, say, in 
L'Ermitage. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find people in Castaic's Cafe Mike, for instance, who don't know a goose 
liver pate from peanut butter, but they can kick a loaded semi down the road 
like a kid pumping a scooter. I like that. 
</P>
<P>
I was raised in a working-class neighborhood where a trucker's status was only 
slightly lower than a parish priest's. We ate slabs of things in those days, 
not slices, and poured ketchup on everything from fried chicken to tapioca 
pudding. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was left on the plate when we were done eatin' and mama considered it 
high praise if we gave the bowl a lick when the soup was gone. 
</P>
<P>
I have long since stopped licking soup bowls and I don't pour things from a 
bottle on delicately sauced oeufs sur le plat, but I am not immune to the truck 
stop blues. 
</P>
<P>
I can hear the air horns blowin' like music down a highway in the night. 
</P>
<P>
I heard 'em for real the other day as my wife and I were tooling south on I-5 
after a week of visiting family. I was driving her blue Nissan pickup over the 
Grapevine pretending I was hauling dry bulk out of Delano when she said, "You 
want to eat at Mike's?" 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't believe I'd heard right. She wasn't raised in a blue-collar 
neighborhood but in a house with a maid, and would rather dance naked for 
bikers in hell than pour ketchup on her eggs. 
</P>
<P>
"You were having a nightmare?" I said pleasantly, honking at a guy in a Zacky 
Farms semi that went rolling by. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said, "I'm just aware you need your mess o' beans once in a while. 
Maybe you'd like to stop and get a tattoo first." 
</P>
<P>
What a woman. She knows I like hanging out with truckers and does it for me. 
Only once have I seen her annoyed in a truck stop. It was at a place near 
Buttonwillow where a cowboy played "Okie From Muskogee" eight times in a row on 
the juke box. 
</P>
<P>
"If he plays that one more time," she said in a voice that could be heard all 
the way to Tulsa, "I'm going to kick out his lights." 
</P>
<P>
The guy had arms longer than his legs and the look of someone who considered 
"Okie From Muskogee" a kind of religious anthem, so I led her out before her 
words reached his brain. Fortunately, that took awhile. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you notice," she said later, "how he growled when he ate?" 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, we ended up at the Cafe Mike, which is just off Castaic's Lake Hughes 
Road, across from the Country Girl Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
The place has been there for more than 20 years and sees the same truckers all 
year 'round. Guys like Dixie Doug and the twins, A. J. and Don. 
</P>
<P>
Don, or maybe it's A. J. (they're identical) has a train whistle on his rig and 
blows it as he drives up. When someone hears the whistle, they put in an order 
for ham and eggs over medium, because that's all he ever eats. 
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is order the first time you come in, waitress Kristie 
Gastineau says, and never order again if you want. They'll just keep serving 
you the same thing forever. 
</P>
<P>
The truckers plunk themselves down at tables or booths and eat with their hats 
on, the way they do at home, I guess. Then they ask for the ketchup and order 
food. 
</P>
<P>
I got Mike's Special for the day, two large eggs with chili, beans and 
tortillas for $5.90. My wife had coffee and spent most of the time watching me 
eat, the way Kathleen Turner watched Michael Douglas in "War of the Roses." 
</P>
<P>
Kristie says you've got to have a real good personality to be a waitress in 
Mike's. She compares it to Mel's Diner in the old television series. "We're 
family," she says, "and the guys who come in are characters." 
</P>
<P>
They sure are. One of them told a joke about a bullfrog and a duck that still 
has me laughing. 
</P>
<P>
As we left, my wife said, "Well, did you enjoy your . . . er . . . chow?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sure did, Truck Stop Baby." 
</P>
<P>
"Good," she said. "Now let's kick the rig on home, shall we?" 
</P>
<P>
I got back on to Eye-5 going south, chuckling about the bull frog and the duck, 
and imagining I was hauling veau on the hoof out of Wyoming.

Burbank's Thomas Murphy is undoubtedly one of the few current Superior Court 
judges who has been known to crack a whip -- literally -- during settlement 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy jokes that the whip, which he keeps hanging in his chamber, dates back 
to his days as a law clerk when he made ends meet by moonlighting as a lion 
tamer. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was a gift that he employs as a way of reducing the tension of 
legal confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
If a lawyer spots the whip and asks him about it, Murphy revealed a while back, 
"I just say I use it if I have to. Sometimes they actually ask me to snap it. I 
can snap it like a lion tamer." 
</P>
<P>
It's only fitting, then, that Murphy has been scheduled to hear a case next 
month involving actress Juliet Prowse. Prowse is suing the "Circus of the 
Stars" television show over an incident that occurred during rehearsal. She was 
bitten by a leopard. 
</P>
<P>
Crack! 
</P>
<P>
There was Elvis, heading through Pasadena one last time Tuesday evening, his 
seaweed hair gleaming in the street lights. The post-Rose Parade view of the 
floats in Victory Park was over. Now the floral figures, accompanied by traffic 
cops with lights flashing, were being towed unceremoniously down Mountain 
Street to whereever it is that floats go to die. 
</P>
<P>
Weary motorists heading home from that traumatic first day back at work seemed 
to take little notice. The holidays were gone. Now the things were just another 
traffic obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
A visitor to the Beverly Center reported that a posh clothing store named 
Bernini displayed a sign in its window that said something like: "Now we cost 
only an arm -- 50% off on everything." For instance, there was an $1,800 suit 
selling for $900. (We'll pause here until you stop laughing.)

Anyway, when we phoned Bernini's to verify the wording on the sign, a clerk 
said: "Uh, yes, it says something like that." 
</P>
<P>
He was told that The Times needed the exact wording. 
</P>
<P>
"But the sign's in the window," he said wearily. "I really don't have time to

Photographer William Reagh's stark black-and-white shots of the concrete and 
asphalt trails of L.A. during the last half-century have earned him the 
unofficial title, "Ansel Adams of the Angels." His latest showing appears in a 
before-and-after calendar, "1990: The Changing Face of L.A." In one shot, Reagh 
shows how the Bonaventure Hotel and other high-rises have replaced such 
eccentric low-rise rooming houses as the Saltbox (rooms $15 per month) in just 
20 years, transforming Bunker Hill. Of course, 20 years in knock-it-down L.A. 
is equivalent to a century in some cities.

These are rather contentious times for the owners of the Happiest Place on 
Earth.

First, grammarians condemned the Walt Disney Co. for the movie title, "Honey, I 
Shrunk the Kids." (It should be "shrank." Or was it "shrinked"? "Shrunkt"?) 
</P>
<P>
Then, families of two or more weren't so happy about Disney raising the price 
for adults and children by $2 -- to $25.50 and $20.50 respectively -- just as 
the holidays began. 
</P>
<P>
And now, the Disney-operated Queen Mary-Spruce Goose tourist attractions have 
fired four employees for refusing to shave their mustaches, including John 
Magness, the 65-year-old ship's officer. 
</P>
<P>
Magness, whose commanding officers didn't object to him wearing his thin tuft 
in combat during the Korean War, pointed out to no avail that Walt Disney (the 
person) also adorned his upper lip, not to mention Spruce Goose designer Howard 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, one of the corporation's next projects is a Disney Classic 
college football game, tentatively set for August. It will feature two teams of 
clean-shaven, unshrunken kids. 
</P>
<P>
Roger and Who?: 
</P>
<P>
With radio traffic advisories detailing crashes every 10 minutes, we can't help 
but wonder whether potential car-buyers might be a bit wary of the new General 
Motors car unveiled in L.A. Wednesday by Chairman Roger Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Its name: the Impact.

EUROPE'S LAST STALINISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The more things change, as the French say, the more they stay the same. In 
Eastern Europe tyrants fall, the governing doctrines of decades are abandoned 
in the wink of an eye, dissidents who were in jail one day become national 
leaders the next. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, but in the mountainous little Adriatic state of Albania, life, such as it 
is, goes on as pretty much as it has since the Communists seized power in 1944. 
Like Brigadoon, only a mean and brutal Brigadoon, Albania stays frozen in time. 
</P>
<P>
Ramiz Alia, who became the country's boss in 1985, has vowed in a New Year's 
statement that Albania won't be affected by the upheavals in other Communist 
states. Lest that dire promise plunge 3 million Albanians into utter 
despondency, Alia hastened to add that 1990 should see improvements in supplies 
of food and consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, anyone who expects to enjoy material improvements had better be 
prepeared to work even harder and put up with "economic austerity measures" 
everywhere. In Albania, the system remains defiantly Stalinist and so does the 
rhetoric. Albanians can take some comfort in recalling that things were just 
the same in Romania, right up to the moment when an explosion of popular wrath 
made a liar out of another dictator who had sworn that nothing would change.

WATT CENTER'S IMPACT ON L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having read Bill Boyarsky's column ("Art Snyder, in the Sprint for Growth," 
Metro, Dec. 15), I hasten to suggest the prime weakness in its comment on the 
City Council's approval of the Watt City Center project. 
</P>
<P>
The project will not "dump an estimated 250,000 vehicles a day onto the Harbor 
Freeway. . . ." In fact, it is so tightly circumscribed by traffic mitigation 
measures that when it is finally built and 100% occupied, with its traffic 
demand management program in place, in the evening peak hour it will generate 
at any single point in time, less than 10 cars southbound on the Harbor Freeway 
between the project location at the 8th Street southbound on-ramp and the Santa 
Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicken Little approach to municipal planning, which calls for planners, 
journalists, and "activists" to run about flapping their wings and shouting 
that "the sky is falling," does little to promote the much more difficult 
process of hard work and long-term planning for traffic movement and economic 
growth intertwined, which is exemplified by the Watt City Center project -- and 
which is critical to the future of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The Watt project was approved by the City Council simply because it did its 
work and participated in that planning, and by its construction does more to 
solve downtown traffic problems than it does to create them. (Ditto, by the 
way, for housing problems, child care, job training, public spaces, urban 
beautification, and a number of other issues not mentioned in Boyarsky's 
column.) 
</P>
<P>
The importance of my role in the project was not the selling of it to the 
council, but the structuring of it in its conception as a program whose 
approval would be to the advantage of the entire city, not just to the builder 
-- and which would be and was finally approved on it own merits.

PHILIPPINE PLOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the excellent article on the former Marcos crony Eduardo Murphy 
Cojuangco Jr. (Part A, Dec. 26). 
</P>
<P>
One does not have to be a genius to conclude which Filipino businessmen and 
politicians were most likely to have been involved in plotting and financing 
the latest attempt to topple the democratically elected Corazon Aquino 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
As your own newspaper reported, ordinary soldiers were openly paid $15 a day 
during the height of the stand-off in the Makati financial district. Reports 
from the islands also tell of payments in millions of pesos to the rebel armed 
forces officers. 
</P>
<P>
But one thing that these businessmen and politicians seem to have forgotten are 
historical lessons, ranging from Adolf Hitler to Manuel Noriega. Once these 
types of people are in the saddle, among the first that they will eliminate are 
the very ones who helped them seize power. 
</P>
<P>
The other disturbing development during the latest coup attempt was the rebels' 
breaking of the time-honored code that the physical safety of the country's 
president not be jeopardized. There is a saying in the Philippines which 
roughly translates thus: "There is no limit to revenge. . . ." Now that the 
code has been broken, there is no telling what the fanatical elements of the 
other side will attempt to do. That can only lead to more misery for ordinary 
Filipinos.

MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to thank the helicopter pilots and their crews for the tremendous 
job they are doing in spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Some complainers can't see beyond the end of their noses. If the Medfly is not 
eradicated, it could ruin California's biggest industry. It could cause the use 
of more pesticides and that would increase farmers' costs and ultimately what 
we pay for fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
The weirdos who claim they are spreading the flies in protest of the use of 
malathion -- if they are indeed doing it -- are causing the use of more 
malathion.

My hat is off to these men who are spending their nights doing a thankless job.

EAST EUROPE: TO BUILD ON THE REVOLUTIONS OF 1989, THE WEST MUST NO LONGER STAND 
AND WATCH. BUT WHEN IT PITCHES IN TO HELP, THE RESPONSE MUST BE ENLIGHTENED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The West was content in 1989 to stand by and cheer the destruction of the Iron 
Curtain. Now its disappearance means that we have to actively help stabilize 
the difficult process of transition to economic and political democracy in a 
region vital to the development of a new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The difficulties of transition stem from the very phenomena that paved the way 
for revolution: political decay and economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Future democratic administrations will have to build a new civil service 
through which to govern. These new administrations will also have to learn on 
the job. After 40 years of dictatorship, most people with government experience 
lack public credibility. The lack of association with government is now a 
strong qualification for elective office. 
</P>
<P>
Problems of political inexperience are compounded by ones of political 
fragmentation. In a natural reaction to one-party rule, political parties are 
mushrooming throughout the region (Hungary now boasts 47). At present, major 
political groups seem willing to cooperate in what are recognized as national 
emergencies. But these temporary, composite fronts, including both Communists 
and opposition, will give way this year through elections to what will probably 
be volatile array of coalition governments. 
</P>
<P>
This shifting political base will make it difficult for governments to deal 
with the legacy of economic crisis. All these countries face the daunting task 
of transforming ramshackle administered economies into ones responding to 
market forces. The political honeymoons will predictably be very short. People 
will use the polling booth to defeat parties that fail to deal with inflation 
and keep shops supplied. 
</P>
<P>
It is in aiding new governments to deliver the economic goods that the West can 
most directly help to stabilize the transition to democratic rule. After a slow 
and piecemeal start, Western governments are beginning to make more substantive 
and coordinated moves. But political democracy can work against as well as for 
economic rationalization. Neither the International Monetary Fund nor other 
Western agencies should assume that East European economies will all easily 
become free-market systems. In these populations accustomed to extensive 
welfare nets and resistant to unemployment, the '90s will probably see the 
emergence of hybrid, mixed-ownership systems. 
</P>
<P>
The speed and shape of change will of course differ from country to country. 
Poland is perhaps among the most receptive to large-scale privatization, 
although overall economic performance will probably be very uneven. Hungary is 
likely to improve living standards faster, while East Germany and 
Czechoslovakia, with their developed industrial traditions, may reach Western 
levels within five to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The very different speeds at which East European states will develop 
economically (and indeed politically) point up the likelihood of a far more 
complex development of the economic and political landscape than some West 
European politicians now envisage. They tend to think in terms of all East 
European states belonging to an outer circle of economies grouped in some kind 
of body removed from, but loosely associated with, the European Community. It 
is more realistic to see some of the Central European states -- East Germany 
(clearly a special case), Hungary and Czechoslovakia -- as oriented toward, if 
not affiliated with, the European Community, while others -- Poland, Bulgaria 
and Romania -- continue economic ties mainly with their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
To some extent a similarly mixed picture of East European alignment is likely 
to emerge on the diplomatic and security front. With non-Communist majorities 
in power in several East European states and Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev adhering to what has amounted to a laissez-faire policy in Eastern 
Europe, the Warsaw Pact clearly has to change to avoid disintegration. Moscow 
proclaims that it wishes to transform this military alliance into a political 
one. Yet it is more difficult to forecast such an evolution. National interest 
and democratic pressures in Czechoslovakia and Hungary could conceivably push 
those states toward neutrality. This would probably be regretted yet 
reluctantly accepted by a leadership in Moscow hoping to Finlandize relations 
with former satellites. Poland, notwithstanding its strong anti-Russian 
traditions, will be inclined by national anxieties about Germany to reach a new 
accommodation with the Soviet Union. National interest thus may well help to 
build a new looser political Warsaw Pact including Poland, Bulgaria (perhaps 
Romania) and even Czechoslovakia and Hungary as associate members with status 
equivalent to that of France in the North Atlantic Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Where East Germany fits into the picture poses the greatest problem, one that 
can be resolved only within the wider context of new security, political and 
economic structures for Europe as a whole. It is the German question, as well 
as their own economic and political aspirations, that makes East Europeans, and 
many Soviets, enthusiastic pan-Europeans. They see more active and wider 
European cooperation and integration as the only way of managing the seemingly 
ineluctable coming together of the two Germanys by enveloping the process 
within one of creating a new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The two alliance systems would seem to be essential scaffolding for the 
building of this new Europe, gradually dismantled only when the new economic, 
political and security arrangements can take the full weight of the structure. 
At present there seems to be a remarkably strong consensus on all sides that 
NATO and the Warsaw Pact need one another, as well as a stronger and broader 
Helsinki process, in order to cope with the problems of transition to a new 
Europe of which the countries of Central and Eastern Europe form the most 
volatile and most vital element. It will need an enlightened Western policy of 
economic aid as well as flexible coordination of political and security 
strategies to build on the revolutions of 1989 and transform Eastern Europe 
from a divide within the old Europe into a bridge for the new.

RACISM: A MAN HAILING A CAB AT LA GUARDIA MIGHT BE A STAR, A HERO, EVEN THE

"Sir!" the black man running the cab stand was saying. 
</P>
<P>
"Sir!" he repeated, finally catching my eye. "Would you mind standing up here 
for a minute?" 
</P>
<P>
Instantly, I knew exactly what he was talking about. I knew the problem. I also 
knew the trick the big, open-faced fellow had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The scene: New York's La Guardia Airport. The time: a few minutes before 10 
p.m. New Year's Eve. Like the other passengers just off the Trump Shuttle from 
Washington, I had been waiting in the cab line without success. Cab after cab 
would make the turn from the expressway, drive slowly past our cab stand, then 
swerve away. 
</P>
<P>
I could see exactly what was happening. The cab drivers, one after another, 
were taking one look at the faces of those just-arrived passengers at the Trump 
Shuttle cab line, then speeding up and heading over to the better pickings at 
the Delta terminal. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Most of the passengers waiting in the Trump Shuttle line were black. 
</P>
<P>
I knew this. So did the frustrated guy running the cab stand. I could see it in 
his look when our eyes connected after the 20th or 30th cab had chosen Delta 
over Trump for his choice of fare. He knew what was happening all right. This 
is what went on night after night. Why should it be any different because a 
white man was standing four or five places back in line? 
</P>
<P>
I had almost had enough of this little vignette in American race relations 
circa 1990. After waiting a good 20 minutes, I prepared myself to just bolt the 
hapless Trump line and make the couple-hundred-yard walk to the Delta terminal. 
What was I supposed to do? I was already late. Was I supposed to stand here all 
night just to prove I'm willing to play and suffer by the same rules that 
punish black people? 
</P>
<P>
But something stopped me. Maybe I'd have been marooned there all night, but I 
also couldn't bring myself to just zip over to the Delta terminal. I kept 
flashing on the looks and feelings that would be exchanged by those left 
behind, those watching a white man striding off to his accustomed better 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you mind standing up here?" 
</P>
<P>
Grabbing my bags, I headed to the front of the line. "I thought that's what was 
going on," I said to the man running the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Then it happened. The very next cab swerved to the left, rejecting the Delta 
terminal and making the wide turn toward those of us who had been waiting 
without hope. 
</P>
<P>
I stepped back and let the group of young black men ahead of me board. 
</P>
<P>
"Thanks," said the man at the stand. 
</P>
<P>
A few days before this, a man named Colin Powell, who happens to be chairman of 
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, was cheered as the liberator of Panama. A few 
hours later, an easy-going politician named David Dinkins took the oath as 
mayor of New York. The following evening, a wonderful quarterback named Tony 
Rice led the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame to its big Orange Bowl victory over 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Had they been waiting for a cab at La Guardia Airport New Year's Eve, they 
might still be standing there.

ESCAPED INMATE, 3 OTHERS TAKEN IN APARTMENT RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of two men who escaped from custody in October was captured Wednesday in a 
raid of an apartment on 42nd Street, San Diego police said. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Para, 30, and three other people were arrested on suspicion of welfare 
fraud, felony harboring of a fugitive and armed robbery, said Gordon Redding of 
the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Para was being held on suspicion of auto theft Oct. 2 when he and Chris Brown, 
31, escaped from a holding area underneath police headquarters, Redding said. 
Brown is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
Para is also known as Martin Velasco, and police believe he is the brother of 
one of the other people arrested Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Redding declined to specify how police were led to the apartment in the 4100 
block of 42nd Street, saying, "We've been receiving tidbits of information and 
sightings here and sightings there." 
</P>
<P>
"Late last night, we received what was pretty well the final piece of the 
puzzle," Redding said. The raid, which took place at 9:15 a.m., involved a 
helicopter and 13 officers. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Velasco, 26; Sinna Essington, 24, and Esther Gutierrez, 24, were also 
arrested at the apartment, which police believe is rented to Gutierrez. 
Essington and Velasco had outstanding warrants for parole violations, and 
Essington is suspected of being involved with welfare fraud, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez was arrested on suspicion of felony harboring of a fugitive and 
misdemeanor possession of narcotics paraphernalia found at the apartment, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they found a starter's pistol in a car believed to be Velasco's 
and are investigating possible links between the suspects and robberies in the 
San Diego area since Para's escape.

MILITARY: THE INVASION OF PANAMA REVEALED WEAKNESSES IN OUR FORCES' 
CAPABILITIES -- AND IN THE PUBLIC'S OVER-HYPED EXPECTATIONS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. military invasion of Panama highlighted some fundamentals that will 
continue to influence the application of American power. First is that Karl von 
Clausewitz's 160-year-old concept of "friction" -- i.e., nothing will ever 
proceed exactly as planned -- is still with us. For example, at Ft. Bragg, 
N.C., the takeoff of elements of the 82nd Airborne Division was delayed by an 
unexpected ice storm; on the opposite coast, at Ft. Ord, Calif., the takeoff of 
elements of the 7th Infantry Division was delayed by dense fog. Despite all the 
advances of modern technology, the caprices of weather still have a major 
effect on the execution of military operations. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the most detailed and precise planning -- and the planning for 
Operation Just Cause was thorough indeed -- mistakes still happen, just as they 
did at the Normandy beachhead 45 years ago. From a military point of view, such 
glitches are to be expected: The best way to deal with friction, Clausewitz 
said, is to anticipate and be prepared for it. But how civilians perceive these 
mistakes may be quite another matter. 
</P>
<P>
The American public has been led into false expectations by the Pentagon brass. 
Trying to build public support, Defense Department bureaucrats discarded 
Clausewitz as inimical to the public relations image they wished to create. 
That was the image of an American military that could conduct flawless 
operations where everything went exactly as planned and where practically no 
one got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Unwittingly, this "zero defects" mentality created a monster, for "surgical 
precision" became the standard by which the media and the public measured 
military prowess. The successes of the Libyan raid and the Grenada incursion, 
for example, were overshadowed by the "frictions" that denied the perfection 
that Americans had been led to expect. Pentagon powers, realizing they had 
created a false and misleading picture, have since made a concerted effort to 
drive a stake through the heart of the "surgical precision" monster. The 
mythology lives on: Initial media reporting on the Panama invasion once again 
focused on glitches rather than successes. 
</P>
<P>
This is serious business that goes far beyond public-relations glitz. In the 
1990s, when fewer and fewer Americans will have firsthand combat knowledge, the 
false notion that military operations can be "surgical" could have disastrous 
consequences. It could tempt us into actions we would soon regret. Americans 
must be told and understand the bloody and imprecise nature of military force. 
</P>
<P>
Another fundamental highlighted by the Panama invasion is that the United 
States remains a world island that must project its power beyond its borders in 
order to influence international events. With geography education in such 
disrepute that some college students believe the Soviet Union is somewhere in 
Central America, such elementary facts bear repeating. 
</P>
<P>
The first requirement of American military strategy is to get there from here. 
In the Panamanian invasion, that reality was somewhat hidden by the fact that 
airlift alone was able to move most of the combat forces into position. But 
Panama was a special case. Not only was it within flying distance from 
continental military bases, there was also a major logistical support 
foundation already in place. 
</P>
<P>
If, as would be the case in most other projections of American power, that 
support base had had to be established concurrent with the invasion, our lift 
capability would have been severely strained. Taking nothing away from the 
enormous effort put forth by the Military Airlift Command, it still remains a 
fact that America's strategic lift capability is in sad shape. Sealift in 
particular is in shambles as America's maritime fleet continues to shrink, and 
it is sealift that normally moves the majority of oil, ammunition and heavy 
combat arms and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of such heavy lift could be deadly. Our success in Panamashould not 
blind us to the fact that the lack of sufficient airlift and sealift remains 
our greatest strategic military shortcoming. Correcting that deficiency should 
be one of the major priorities for the 1990s.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego man was indicted Wednesday on two counts stemming from the delivery 
by sea of 14,000 pounds pounds of marijuana to Santa Barbara, a federal 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
Britt Lance Reynolds, 36, was captain of the fishing vessel Rae Ann, which 
carried the marijuana from Hawaii in October, 1987, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Swan said in a statement. Reynolds, arrested Dec. 21 in San Diego, was 
charged with conspiring to import marijuana and to possess marijuana with the 
intent to distribute it. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Reynolds could be sentenced to life in prison and fined $4 
million on each count, Swan said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds' home, the 47-foot sailboat Kaihala, has been seized by federal Drug 
Enforcement Administration officers because they believe Reynolds used 
drug-related proceeds to finance and make "major improvements" to the boat, 
Swan said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds is being held without bail pending a hearing today, Swan said.

GUILD, UNION-TRIBUNE STILL STALLED; MORE TALKS FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiators for the San Diego Newspaper Guild and the Union-Tribune Publishing 
Co. spent nearly six hours at the bargaining table Wednesday and agreed to meet 
again Friday in an effort to break a stalemate over a new labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's negotiating session, the first since Dec. 22, was arranged by a 
state mediator who has been trying to resolve the labor dispute for about a 
year. The mediator carried contract proposals between the two negotiating teams 
that remained in separate rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The mediation session failed to bring the two sides closer on major areas of 
disagreement, local Guild President Ed Jahn said. However, negotiators made 
enough progress on minor issues to warrant an additional session on Friday, 
Jahn said. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, which began at 1:30 p.m., were suspended at about 7 p.m. The two 
sides will meet at 9:30 a.m. on Friday at the Hyatt Islandia. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators have met about 60 times over the past 22 months but have been 
unable to reach agreement on a contract for about 1,150 guild employees. The 
old contract expired in June, 1988. The guild represents reporters, 
photographers and employees in the advertising, circulation, library and 
maintenance departments. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 22, guild leaders offered what they described as a major concession in 
an unsuccessful effort to reach agreement on a new contract. However, those 
daylong negotiations failed to produce an agreement on several issues, 
including the contract's length. Management has insisted upon a one-year 
contract while the guild is seeking a three-year agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Guild members authorized a strike against the newspaper company in an emotional 
and fiery meeting last month. The San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council 
announced that it will mobilize support for Union-Tribune employees if they 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
Eliseo Medina, president of the Service Employees International Union, Local 
102, said union leaders will try to get 10,000 union families or more to cancel 
their subscriptions if there is a strike at the Union-Tribune Publishing Co. 
Medina said there are about 100,000 families in San Diego County that have at 
least one wage earner belonging to a union.

BANDIT TAKES DAY'S RECEIPTS FROM CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A gunman wielding a semiautomatic assault weapon ambushed two unarmed security 
guards and a cashier Wednesday at Children's Hospital and Health Center, police 
said, making off with almost $400,000, most of it in checks. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the gunman, wearing a red and white mask, hid in the bushes outside 
the Frost Street hospital shortly after 4 p.m., where he waited for the guards 
and the hospital's lead cashier to pass by with the day's receipts, which they 
were carrying from a truck to the main office of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
When the three approached with a cash box and a bank deposit bag, the man 
stepped from the bushes and ordered the guards to put the bag back into the 
truck, police said. He then fled with the money and the truck, heading east on 
Frost Street. 
</P>
<P>
The truck, a white Chevrolet pickup with the words Children's Hospital on the 
side, was recovered an hour later on Berger Avenue, about a block from the 
hospital, said Sharon Ross, a hospital spokeswoman. A stocking mask was found 
inside, she said. 
</P>
<P>
No shots were fired, and no one was injured in the robbery, the first for the 
35-year-old hospital, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
The money included payments from individuals and insurance companies, but only 
$1,000 to $5,000 of it was in cash, she said. The checks and cash, which had 
been brought from a nearby administrative center, were to be placed in the 
hospital safe and later taken to a bank by armored truck. The transfer is part 
of the daily routine of the hospital, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
"With any luck, hopefully we will recoup those (checks) and get them back. They 
won't do him any good," she said. "We will go back to the payer and ask them to 
stop payment on the check and reissue another." 
</P>
<P>
The robber did not take the cash box, which held $1,000.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ian Marantz's misinformed stance on University of California admissions 
policies (Letters, Dec. 27) sadly represents the widespread belief that 
Asian-Americans are considered "affirmative action" students. 
</P>
<P>
At UC Irvine and at all UC campuses, only African-American, Native American and 
Latino applicants fall under the affirmative action program. 
</P>
<P>
As an intermediate step toward an equal-opportunity society, affirmative action 
aims to "balance the ethnic imbalances" that institutions have created to 
ensure that under-represented students are not rejected admission because of 
their color. 
</P>
<P>
One reason Asian-Americans are well represented at UC Irvine and also 
ineligible for affirmative action is their accomplishment in proving their 
academic worth despite all the discriminatory barriers that still exist in 
society. 
</P>
<P>
But now the UC system is turning its back on meritocracy by refusing admission 
to qualified Asian-American students. 
</P>
<P>
Marantz claims that UC Irvine discriminates against white Americans while 
reserving spots for Asian-Americans. How can that be when white and Asian 
students are theoretically admitted under just one criterion -- merit? Yet 
current admission policies prove this untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Asians, UC admissions officials are fusing personal merit and 
skin color. Regrettably, the latter wins out in the dominant society, even 
today. 
</P>
<P>
UC admissions now overtly embraces discrimination, once again, in favor of 
whites. By reserving places for white students while rejecting qualified 
(sometimes more qualified) Asian applicants, the university is throwing 
meritocracy out the window. 
</P>
<P>
Let's not revert to the discriminatory sins. Instead, the aim should be a 
color-blind society based upon individual merit.

LAFFITTE IS FINALLY ON A ROLL, AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR USIU 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Demetrius Laffitte, who is called "D-Train" by his U.S. International 
basketball teammates, is back on track. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte, who led USIU in scoring and rebounding last season, has things going 
again after a slow start. And that is exactly what the Gulls will need if they 
are going to get back in the season. Laffitte scored 23 points on 10-of-12 
shooting Wednesday night to help lead the Gulls to a 102-77 rout of Central 
Connecticut State at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bradshaw, the fifth-leading scorer in the country, had 35 points and 
Steve Smith added 26 for USIU (6-10). Kevin Swann scored 20 points to lead 
Central Connecticut State (1-9). 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte had 17 points in the first half as the Gulls took a 45-32 lead. They 
never trailed, and the closest Central Connecticut State could get in the 
second half was 50-41. Coach Gary Zarecky then put the starters back in, and 
USIU easily pulled away for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte was a Street &amp; Smith preseason independent All-American for 
1989-90 but was averaging 15.3 points per game and shooting just 57% from the 
free throw line after USIU's first 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
In his past five games, Laffitte is averaging 22 points, shooting 70% from the 
field and 78% from the line. He is also leading the team in rebounding for the 
season with nine per game. Against Central Connecticut State, he had eight 
rebounds, four assists, two steals and a blocked shot. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the key to our winning," Zarecky said. "We're having to learn to play 
with Kevin (Bradshaw). Last year our chemistry was such that we didn't have the 
so-called superstar. Kevin, in turn, has to get his teammates involved, 
especially Demetrius. We're going to need a solid Demetrius to win on the 
road." 
</P>
<P>
That is where the Gulls have seven of their remaining 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
Laffitte was not coming up with these kinds of complete performances at the 
beginning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt there was a lot of pressure on me," Laffitte said. "I wasn't 
concentrating. I was just coming out here and playing. I thought everything 
would fall for me." 
</P>
<P>
Very little fell, except perhaps for Laffitte's scoring and rebounding 
averages. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm coming out of it right now," said Laffitte, who played at Monte Vista High 
School. "Well, I am out of it."

PEOPLE: CAPELLUPO TAKES POST AT DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move to modify its vast reorganization in 1989, McDonnell Douglas has 
named John P. Capellupo deputy president of its Douglas Aircraft unit in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Capellupo, a veteran of McDonnell's operations in St. Louis for more than 30 
years, will begin in the newly created position Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Aircraft underwent a tumultuous reorganization last year, in which all 
of the 5,200 members of management were forced to apply for new jobs. The 
previous eight layers of management were trimmed to five. 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Don Hanson denied that the addition of Capellupo will add a 
layer of management, since he will work "side-by-side" with Douglas President 
Robert H. Hood Jr. All executives reporting to Hood will also report to 
Capellupo. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hanson said Douglas delivered 118 MD-80 jetliners in 1989, somewhat 
shy of the goal of 123 aircraft set by Hood last summer. Employees on the 
flight ramp, where aircraft are delivered, worked around the clock over the 
holidays in an effort to get as many aircraft as possible delivered. 
</P>
<P>
The company also failed to fly the MD-11 jetliner by year-end, despite a big 
drive to do so last week. At one point, the company hoped to fly the aircraft 
last Thursday. Hood set a goal last summer of having three of the test aircraft 
flying by year-end. RALPH VARTABEDIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Jeffrey B. Lane, recently removed as president and chief operating officer of 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., has resigned from the securities firm. 
</P>
<P>
Lane said he left because he was no longer effective as a result of a 
realignment of the firm's senior management. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not happy and not enthusiastic, you can't be effective," Lane said, 
explaining why he left Shearson after 20 years with the brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
Before the shake-up in November, Lane had been the No. 2 executive after 
Chairman Peter Cohen. Cohen could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lane's resignation from Shearson -- which was effective Friday but revealed 
only after the holiday weekend -- was surprising only in its timing, industry 
observers said. 
</P>
<P>
"The only surprise to me was that he left as quickly as he did," said Perrin 
Long of Lipper Analytical Services.

MAQUILADORA GROWTH DOWN CONSIDERABLY IN '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Affected perhaps by political uncertainty and insufficient labor and water 
supplies, the growth in maquiladora permits issued in the Tijuana region slowed 
considerably in 1989 contrasted with the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Maquiladoras, the plants operated by foreign manufacturers in Mexico to take 
advantage of low-cost labor, reached a total of 680 in the Tijuana-Tecate area 
at year's end, up 17% from the 579 foreign-operated plants in operation a year 
ago. The total of new permits issued in 1988 represented a 45% increase from 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decline, Mexican officials said the permits demonstrate that 
maquiladoras are still popular among foreign manufacturers, particularly those 
making products destined for the U.S. market. Employees working at the plants 
in the Tijuana area increased over the year to 70,758, up 34% from the 52,957 
workers employed at the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And maquiladoras should continue to proliferate in 1990 if the recently 
liberalized rules governing them have the desired effect of boosting 
applications, said Jose Luis Ascolani, the Baja California delegate of the 
federal Secretary of Commerce and Industrial Development, the agency 
responsible for issuing maquiladora permits. 
</P>
<P>
Among the changes decreed Dec. 22 by the Mexican federal government is the 
centralization of seven different permits and approvals required to open a 
maquiladora within the regional SECOFI offices, Ascolani said, a move that 
should considerably streamline and shorten the time required for permit 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The new laws also ease the transference of supplies and components among 
foreign manufacturers in Mexico, and increase the percentage of goods produced 
by maquiladoras that can be sold inside Mexico, from 20% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
The laws, which also allow foreign companies for the first time to bring their 
own telecommunications equipment into Mexico, also make maquiladora permits 
good for an indefinite period, as opposed to the two-year limit previously in 
force. 
</P>
<P>
In another move to attract more maquiladoras, the Mexican government, in 
response to protests lodged by foreign manufacturers, has indefinitely shelved 
a proposed 2% tax on maquiladora assets, Ascolani said. 
</P>
<P>
Some foreign manufacturers considering moves to Mexico were discouraged last 
year by the shortage of labor in the Tijuana area, a condition that has 
resulted in fierce competition for workers and a high rate of employee 
turnover, said Tony Ramirez, vice president of Made in Mexico, a Chula 
Vista-based consulting company that assists manufacturers in setting up 
maquiladoras. 
</P>
<P>
Political uncertainty caused by the election in July of Ernesto Ruffo Appel as 
governor of Baja California. Ruffo, who was a candidate for the National Action 
Party, or PAN, opposing the entrenched Institutional Revolutionary Party, or 
PRI, may also have given some companies pause, industry observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortages of water and power in certain areas of Tijuana may also have been 
responsible for the drop-off in maquiladora permit applications in early 1989, 
Ramirez said. He said interest has rebounded in recent months, however, largely 
because some of the shortages have been alleviated. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging problems with Mexico's "infrastructure," the broad-based term 
used to describe utilities, public works, transportation and labor, Ascolani 
said the government hopes to improve the situation in part by privatizing many 
state-owned corporations, a move designed to attract increased foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
For many manufacturers, Mexico's disadvantages are obviously outweighed by its 
pluses, led by low hourly wages. Including taxes and benefits, average hourly 
wages are about $1.30, a fraction of the cost of comparable labor in the United 
States, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
"The maquiladora concept is generating a lot of interest in other than U.S. 
companies," Ramirez said. "We have seen a lot of European interest, electronics 
companies mainly. Manufacturers of wood-related products, such as furniture and 
cabinetmaking, also showed increased interest last year." 
</P>
<P>
The largest category of maquiladoras at year's end was electronics, with 131 
plants, Ascolani said.

MAGAZINES: UNCOVERING SOVIET WOMEN AND REAL EDDIE MURPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the Berlin Wall down, Western magazines are charging in to give Americans 
their first good peek behind the Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
The most revealing uncoverage to date may be "The Women of Russia," in the 
February Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
An accompanying article by photo editor Jeff Cohen details the relatively 
ho-hum derring-do that went into capturing the naked truth about the evil 
empire on film. 
</P>
<P>
But if glasnost has taught us anything, it's that folks are all pretty much 
alike underneath, right? Take away the backdrop of St. Basil's Cathedral and 
the Lenin props, and you couldn't tell this layout from "The Girls of the PAC 
10." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the magazine, Eddie Murphy also reveals himself, in a sometimes 
hilarious, frequently obscene, always intriguing interview with editor David 
Rensin. 
</P>
<P>
Astutely noting that "the press builds you up and tears you down; I'm in the 
tear-down stage right now," Murphy remains in control of the interview. The 
comedian turned multimillionaire mogul rather enjoys being feared by Hollywood, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy repeatedly states that he wants to keep their conversations superficial. 
But Rensin coaxes psychological revelations from the self-defined "matinee 
idol." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most peculiar personality quirk unearthed is that Murphy -- who 
lives in a Graceland-like New Jersey estate called Bubble Hill, who choked 
director John Landis on the set of "Coming to America" and who sometimes 
cruises through impoverished crack neighborhoods trying to talk users out of 
their habit -- thinks of himself as normal. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy comes across as a complex blend of sometimes conflicting traits. He's 
bright, morally conservative (except for a decided lustfulness to which Jerry 
Falwell might object), naively sexist, apolitical, socially conscious, 
surprisingly humble, and a bit solipsistic. 
</P>
<P>
But few readers are likely to find him normal. How normal, after all, is 
someone who thinks that singer Michael Jackson's only abnormality is that "he 
doesn't use profanity?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Brighter Side of the Greenhouse Effect 
</P>
<P>
Next to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and other celebs, the greenhouse effect 
is about the most popular subject in magazine-dom these days. Most mainstream 
magazines accept that this projected global warming, attributed to the burning 
of fossil fuels, is real, and to be avoided at all costs. A few, mainly 
conservative publications, have dismissed it as another paranoid fantasy of 
worrywart environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there is the libertarian monthly Reason, which believes that the 
greenhouse threat is real all right, but says, "Hey, we can live with that." 
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Keep Your Cool," the Reason article presents a clear paraphrase of 
the scientists who argue that the 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide humanity's 
cars and factories are pumping into the atmosphere is enough to tip the natural 
balance and cause temperatures on the planet to rise 5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit 
over the next century (or two or three). 
</P>
<P>
Author T. A. Heppenheimer, also agrees with scientists' assessment of the 
problems this twist of the global thermostat will bring: hot weather, regional 
droughts, major changes to ecosystems, and flooding of low-lying lands due to 
the melting of Antarctic ice sheets. 
</P>
<P>
But Heppenheimer's reaction to these "unpleasant" problems is markedly 
different than the reaction of most. 
</P>
<P>
Some environmentalists have suggested that we could stop the buildup of carbon 
dioxides by halving worldwide consumption of fossil fuels, by halting 
deforestation (trees make oxygen) and by replanting the clear-cuts. 
</P>
<P>
With true libertarian sang-froid, Heppenheimer argues that such measures would 
be intolerable, resulting in a worldwide economic collapse -- after all, 
"carbon dioxide is a byproduct of industrial growth and of a prosperous 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
Rather, he suggests we look on the bright side -- the greenhouse will slow the 
next Ice Age, and places such as Siberia will become Sunbelt hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
The article's approach seems quite reasonable. Still, readers may find it hard 
not to envision Heppenheimer in Bermuda shorts and flowered shirt, sipping a 
tropical drink and listening to Bobby McFerrin as he spells out his solutions: 
Don't worry -- the heat's going to take a long time to peak; be happy -- we'll 
build more air conditioners and persuade the populations of New Orleans, 
Sacramento, and dozens of other cities to move to higher ground. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Reputation of Getting Smarter 
</P>
<P>
Well into its second year, Smart magazine is beginning to live up to its title. 
The January-February issue packs between its covers an array of copy that is 
both intelligent and -- to fit the more elusive definition of the word -- brisk 
and stylish. 
</P>
<P>
In one article, Loren Jenkins treats readers to a glimpse of the brave and 
buffoonish exploits of Hunter S. Thompson. Bullets fly, peacocks squeal, trout 
go belly up and tigers prowl as the father of gonzo journalism battles the 
"greedhead " developers (one in particular) he thinks are trying to turn his 
beloved Woody Creek, Colo., into a garish clone of neighboring Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Adam Begley provides an interesting look at cult novelist Thomas 
Pynchon's obsessively reclusive life; Spy magazine editor E. Graydon Carter 
writes a surprisingly un-snide profile of "Saturday Night Live's" Gatsby-esque 
producer, Lorne Michaels; and Robert Knafo presents a "demystification of 
Jackson Pollock," titled "Sex, Lies, and Abstract Expressionism." (Magazine 
editors: no more plays on that movie title, please). 
</P>
<P>
And there's more: A slightly leering but entertaining look at Meg Ryan titled 
"The Mysteries of the Orgasm"; an excerpt from journalist Rian Malan's new book 
on returning to his native South Africa (a book that would seem to deserve all 
the excerpting in magazines it has received); and a novella by author Jim 
Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks, editor Terry McDonell quotes composer Gustav Mahler: 
"If you think you're boring your audience, go slower, not faster." And there's 
a sense that the editors -- unlike their more cynical comrades at so many of 
the established publications with which Smart competes -- have stepped back, 
taken a deep breath, and decided to actually care about everything that goes 
into their book. 
</P>
<P>
Even the short features and columns, by the likes of Bruce Jay Friedman, Eve 
Babitz, and Tony Hendra, say something worth saying. 
</P>
<P>
About the only item in the whole issue that smacks of the lazy pretentiousness 
so prevalent in slick, hip magazines is a photo layout by German photo-artiste 
Jaschi Klein. Featuring bleak landscapes littered with expressionless models, 
it has all the clever imagination of an ad for Obsession perfume.

A big hit: The smash pop group New Kids on the Block has inspired a 
hearing-impaired toddler to begin speaking this fall, her mother said. Dolores 
Watts, of Dundee, Md., said her daughter's hearing had been affected at 11 
months by ear infections. 
</P>
<P>
"She couldn't speak in sentences or even say mommy and daddy correctly," she 
said. Then the 2-year-old saw a New Kids video at a birthday party. The next 
morning, she awoke and said her first sentence: "Mommy, I want Joe." Joe 
McIntyre, Donnie Wahlberg, Danny Wood and Jordan and Jonathan Knight are the 
band's members.

Lest We Forget: The now-dead decade gave us this immortal quote from Vice 
President Dan Quayle: "Hawaii has always been a very pivotal role in the 
Pacific. It is in the Pacific. It is a part of the United States that is an 
island that is right here . . . "

The Royals: For the second year running, Princess Anne topped her mother, Queen 
Elizabeth II, as the goingest member of Britain's royal family. Anne, 39, who 
separated from husband Mark Phillips in August, filled 737 official engagements 
in 1989 for public and private groups. The figures are tallied as a hobby by 
London insurance broker Tim O'Donovan. The queen came in second place with 592 
spots; she was followed by her husband, Prince Philip, who was at 569 events.

ART BUCHWALD: GRATEFUL DEAD RISE IN PANAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART BUCHWALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest secret military weapon from the American arsenal showed up in Panama 
when U.S. military forces tried to drive Manuel Noriega out of the Vatican 
embassy by blasting him with rock music all day long. While it failed to 
achieve its goal, it is now estimated that there will be a lot of 
hard-of-hearing Panamanians once the fighting is over. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of using rock music to dislodge ex-heads of state and other sleazy 
enemies was thought up by the U. S. Psychological Warfare Division at the 
Pentagon. It was actually an invention of a senior staff member, Col. Wolfpack 
MacArthur. Wolfpack got the idea after he had been driven out of his home last 
spring by his son's repeated playing of the Grateful Dead's "Skeletons From a 
Closet." 
</P>
<P>
I spoke to Wolfpack as he sat ramrod straight on top of four loudspeakers at 
Andrews Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
"Any casualties?" I yelled at him. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost three microphones and one woofer, but we knocked out four Panamanian 
National Guardsmen, three nuns and a Papal Nuncio." 
</P>
<P>
"Any damage to Noriega's eardrums?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfpack said, "He's starting to feel the pressure. We're going to fire off the 
Rolling Stones' Top 10 tomorrow, and if that doesn't make him surrender, 
nothing will." 
</P>
<P>
I shouted up, "Are we to assume that rock warfare is the wave of the future?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's a proven deterrent. We know that no grown-up can survive four hours of 
the Led Zeppelin. We believe that any tinhorn dictator will come out with his 
hands high rather than listen to three Jefferson Airplane singles." 
</P>
<P>
"What about the Geneva Convention, which forbids anyone to play loud music 
around a diplomatic mission?" 
</P>
<P>
"We don't recognize the Geneva Convention. Noriega is a thief and a drug 
dealer, and we will torture him with the U2's 'Rattle and Hum' no matter what 
world opinion thinks." 
</P>
<P>
"If rock music is such a successful weapon, why is Noriega still in the Vatican 
embassy?" 
</P>
<P>
"The CIA reports that he may have taken earplugs in there with him." 
</P>
<P>
"Why didn't the CIA know this at the beginning?" 
</P>
<P>
"They were watching the back of the building -- Noriega came in through the 
front. But we're not worried. We have more rock records in stock than Noriega 
has earplugs." 
</P>
<P>
"The Vatican has officially complained about the noise, and Washington 
announced that they might knock it off." 
</P>
<P>
"That's typical of Washington. They give us the rock war weapons and then they 
chicken out to Rome. If they just let us play one Madonna platter, we will have 
Noriega sticking his fingers in his ears and running naked down the streets of 
Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Wolfpack told me that many countries are interested in rock war but the United 
States is worried that the weapon is too powerful to be allowed to fall into 
the hands of foreign governments. "Can you imagine what the Libyans would do to 
us if they could play Michael Jackson at high pitch in front of an American 
consulate?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you going back to Panama?" I asked the colonel. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, as soon as we add two more boom boxes to our amplifiers. We shall return, 
and this time we're going to knock Noriega out of bed with Bruce Springsteen's 
greatest hits if it kills us."

LEGAL VIEW: 'CREDIT CARD SECRETS' AN OPEN BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY S. KLEIN, Klein is an attorney and assistant to the publisher of The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who has ever wrangled with a credit card company will appreciate a new 
book, "Credit Card Secrets," by attorney Howard Strong. It is a witty, 
sometimes sarcastic, and always practical look at the credit card industry -- 
and an excellent guide to protecting your legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
Trying to correct a mistake on your Visa or MasterCard bill can be a 
frustrating experience, even for a lawyer. Your letters -- you should always 
complain in writing -- are frequently answered with computer-generated 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
And it is difficult to know exactly what to say and to whom you should write. 
Unfortunately, the explanation of your rights included in mailings by credit 
card companies is often written in standard government-issue legalese. 
</P>
<P>
Strong explains your rights in a friendly, easy-to-understand style and 
provides hypothetical examples as well as real-life experiences of credit card 
users who have won their battles with the banks that issue the cards. (A 
persistent card user received more than a $2,000 credit after numerous letters 
complaining about billing errors and returned merchandise.) 
</P>
<P>
"Complaining is a learned art," Strong writes, and offers these basic tips: 
</P>
<P>
* Nastiness gets you nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
* Do not start at the top. 
</P>
<P>
* Fighting is hard work (some small things may not be worth it). 
</P>
<P>
* Know what you want. 
</P>
<P>
* Say: "I have a problem and I need your help." 
</P>
<P>
* Be persistent. And brief. 
</P>
<P>
* Give a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
* Type your complaint. 
</P>
<P>
* Never send originals of documents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the common-sense discussion of your rights when it comes to 
billing errors, the book details the procedure you can use when you are 
dissatisfied with merchandise you've purchased on a credit card. Under the 
Federal Fair credit Billing Act, you can demand that the credit card issuer 
(the bank) not pay the merchant for items you purchased. There are limitations, 
however. The charged merchandise must have cost more than $50 and been 
purchased in your home state or within 100 miles of your billing address. And 
this right to "stop payment" doesn't apply to items ordered directly from the 
credit card company. 
</P>
<P>
First, you must make a good- faith effort to work out the problem with the 
merchant, but then you "just tell the credit company not to pay the bill." If 
you can't get the card company to comply to your request, Strong outlines how 
to pursue your rights. 
</P>
<P>
The author also discusses why a credit card company should not cancel your 
credit card without notice, citing a court case in which a man learned to his 
dismay that his card had been canceled when he tried to use it to pay for an 
expensive meal he had just finished eating. 
</P>
<P>
He discusses what to do if someone steals your card, how to pick the best card 
for your needs, and what you should know about currency exchanges for 
international purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Strong advises using an experienced lawyer -- and not suing in small claims 
court -- when you can't resolve a credit card dispute, because if you win, you 
have the right to collect legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't find "Credit Card Secrets" in your local bookstore, you can 
purchase it from the publisher for $29, which includes shipping and taxes. The 
publisher is the Boswell Corp., Box 7100, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90212, 
telephone (213) 478-2056. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of credit, Bankcard Holders of America, a nonprofit group, now has 
available a do-it-yourself credit-check kit, including a directory of credit 
bureau offices and a pamphlet called "Understanding Credit Bureaus," designed 
to help consumers correct problems with their credit records. Write: BHA Credit 
Check Kit, 560 Herndon Parkway, Suite 120, Herndon, Va. 22070. Include $2 for 
postage and handling.

CASTRO'S LONG WAR AGAINST CUBA'S INTELLECTUALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER, TIMES BOOK CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Self-Portrait of the Other by Heberto Padilla. Translated by Alexander Coleman. 
(Farrar Straus Giroux: $18.95; 212 pp.) 
</P>
<P>
Heberto Padilla, a distinguished poet, was briefly jailed by Fidel Castro 20 
years ago, released, and made to issue a statement of self-criticism for having 
damaged the Cuban Revolution by failing to understand it properly. 
</P>
<P>
It was the greatest disaster in the long history of Castro's ruthless, but 
curiously hesitant, and always convoluted war against the Cuban intellectuals. 
They had rallied to support him in 1959 in the belief that he was conducting a 
revolution that would be radical and leftist, but able to permit a kind of 
embattled freedom at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
It was Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who remains a steady supporter of Castro to this 
day, who proclaimed the disaster. He did not know whether Padilla had damaged 
the Revolution, he said at the time. "But I do know that his 'self-criticism' 
is doing damage." Indeed: It caused the final rejection of Castro by 
intellectual circles in Europe and the United States who had maintained, 
despite growing dismay, some public faith in the Cuban Revolution. Castro's 
support of the invasion of Czechoslovakia was the last straw; the camel-back 
collapsed two years later with Padilla's sad statement. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the Revolution, all freedom; outside it, none," Castro had told his 
intellectuals at the start of the '60s, nearly 10 years before Padilla's 
arrest. They took him at his word. Padilla was one of the fiery and talented 
circle that put out the remarkable Monday literary supplement to "Revolucion," 
the favored newspaper in the early white-hot years. Revolucion's editor was 
Carlos Franqui; the editor of the supplement was the writer Guillermo Cabrera 
Infante. Both of these, and Padilla, and many others are exiles today. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper and supplement both stood for a radical but free-spirited discourse, 
though sometimes the supplement staff gritted its teeth and devoted an issue to 
the 1960 cultural achievements of North Korea or China. Everyone understood you 
needed allies in the struggle against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with Castro's definition was that he was the only one to decide 
what was "within" the Revolution. "Within" steadily shrank. "Revolucion" was 
shut down in favor of the subservient and unreadable "Granma." Even so, the 
young fire-eaters were not harshly treated, at least at first. 
</P>
<P>
They were sent abroad as cultural attaches or, in Padilla's case, as a 
correspondent in Moscow. Later, he was briefly a traveling representative for 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade. He knew no foreign trade, he told Che Guevara, 
who helped him get the job. Never mind, Guevara replied; he himself was 
Minister of Heavy Industry and knew no industry. The important thing was to 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, who had known Castro when the latter was a student leader in the fight 
against Batista, was kept in Cuba for 10 years after his "confession." He 
worked as a translator and could publish nothing. The police had instructed him 
to report any of his friends who snubbed him after his self-criticism. The 
worst thing, he writes with a heartbreaking irony, is that nobody did. 
</P>
<P>
International pressure finally got Castro to let him come to the United States 
in 1980. Garcia Marquez helped, though not until he had lectured Padilla 
loftily on his "duty" to stay in Cuba. The writer Alejo Carpentier, aged and 
much protected, gave him a similar lecture over beer. To leave would be to 
encourage the right. "We can't get into a fight with the left, even though it 
is lame, one-eyed and ugly," Carpentier cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready to hit him on the head with a beer bottle," Padilla writes. 
</P>
<P>
It has taken him nearly 10 years to publish this memoir. It is a tormented 
piece of writing; it wanders, it limps, it afflicts itself from time to time 
with poetic effects that seem to beg the question. A clumsy translation doesn't 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla is a poet, not a political fighter. In some profound way, he has not 
quite overcome the question that held so many for so long in intellectual 
bondage. Many of those who shared Castro's vision have struggled to overcome 
its hold upon them. Understandably, it is not easy. It is not alluring to a 
Latin American patriot to go for the alternative of American soldiers playing 
rock music outside the Vatican Nunciature in Panama in order to spook Manuel 
Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Some have turned cynical. Padilla has not; it makes his book murkier to read, 
but in a way, it makes it more worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
He is, in any case, a man who lives by words. He may have effectively damaged 
Castro by his "confession." But he has damaged himself too; and although he 
doesn't explicitly say so, the shattered, sometimes hallucinatory style of his 
memoir seems to confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
In its account of how Castro's charm, magnetism and mania for personal power 
corrupted the Revolution's promise, Padilla's book lacks the force and detail 
of other memoirs, notably those of Carlos Franqui. The reader needs patience 
with some of the byways. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla does not really analyze what made him "confess." His physical 
mistreatment was relatively minor; he was not incarcerated for more than six 
weeks or so, though, of course, he might well have been sent back to jail. He 
writes about it all almost dreamily; as one might recollect a nervous 
breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
And yet we sense the main thing. The central part of the book is the limbo-like 
nightmare of those half dozen years when Padilla and his fellow intellectuals 
had been displaced but were still being given gilded missions abroad. 
</P>
<P>
It was a long ordeal of hearing the news from Cuba, of trying to explain it, of 
trying to avoid judgment, but of being inexorably backed into it. It is a 
profound demoralization; one, for example, that caused two of Padilla's friends 
-- the military attache in Moscow and the Minister of Foreign Trade -- to kill 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Padilla's portraits are hazy; several are unforgettable. There is a 
splendid recollection of Fernando Lezama Lima, the grossly fat, decadent, 
homosexual and utterly courageous poet who was too prominent internationally to 
be bullied. The police kept trying; he would deflect them with sheer Baroque 
prolixity. "Prince of resistance and honor," Padilla -- who dislikes his poetry 
-- calls him. 
</P>
<P>
And there are the portraits of Castro. He visited Padilla as a prisoner, 
remarking offhandedly that "today I have time to talk to you and I think you 
have time too." They had another long talk just before Padilla was allowed to 
leave. Castro used a melancholy charm, which soon turned rotten. He lamented 
that Cuba's intellectuals never understood the Revolution. He treated Padilla 
like an old comrade in arms. Each of them, he implied, was serving History in 
his own way: Fidel, as dictator; Padilla, as prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
It is a ghastly caricature of Hegelian dialectic. It is also part of Castro's 
peculiar need to win over those he talks to. He wants to be admired, even by 
his victims. If he could arrange it, perhaps, he would have the dead say hello.

MISS MANNERS: PERILS OF DANCING WITH A TOOTHPICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS 
</P>
<P>
In our dinner-dance club, there is a nice attorney in his 50s who insists on 
dancing with a toothpick protruding from his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
I have been afraid he would put out some woman's eye if he were accidentally 
bumped, as one often is on a crowded dance floor. Please, repeat your 
"toothpick manners." 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- It is wrong to put out a lady's eye with a toothpick on the 
dance floor. Is that the rule you mean? 
</P>
<P>
Or do you want to know how to tell him to take that stupid thing out of his 
mouth? 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners suggests that anybody whose business this is, which is to say any 
lady contemplating dancing with him, tell him that, to avoid just the sort of 
danger you describe, she will wait until he is finished picking his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
You and Miss Manners know that it isn't chiefly the danger that is offensive; 
it is the vulgarity. We cannot politely tell people to stop being vulgar, but 
we can sometimes delicately warn people of danger; thus, your excuse will do 
very well. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- My aunt does everything by the book: Invitations go out on 
time, thank-yous arrive promptly; she is the picture of social grace. However, 
by the third drink, she will invariably (in front of all the guests) turn to my 
husband and ask, "Just what kind of money do you make?" 
</P>
<P>
We are so stunned by this highly personal question that we are at a loss for 
words. How would you handle this? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Like a joke. 
</P>
<P>
Miss Manners is aware that it is not a scream to be embarrassed by a tediously 
tipsy relative, but cannot allow you to be rude to this lady, who seems to have 
lost her place in that book you say she does everything by. Something along the 
lines of "Oh, the same kind as everyone else" or "We're doing just fine, 
auntie, how are you?" should do if it is rapidly followed by a new topic of 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am a single woman who often travels alone for business 
and pleasure. I am stumped for a ladylike occupation to fill in the time 
between ordering a meal and its arrival. I have experimented with writing 
personal letters at the table. Will this behavior put me entirely beyond the 
pale, even if I use black ink and white paper? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners is afraid that it will. For a solitary diner, 
reading is permissible behavior; writing is not. Do not attempt to find any 
logic in this distinction, because there isn't any. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- Two years ago, when I had my bat mitzvah, I received in 
the mail a gift from a teacher I hadn't seen for years. About eight months 
later, I discovered that I'd never sent this person a thank-you note. I was so 
embarrassed by the lateness that I just decided to ignore the situation. This 
is still bothering me. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Ignoring the transgression didn't help, did it? What is more, 
it never will. Miss Manners promises that you will never emerge from etiquette 
purgatory until you write that letter. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, it should contain not only a long story about how much the 
present has meant to you and how often it makes you think of the teacher, but a 
lot of groveling about how awful you felt when you discovered that you had 
neglected to let the teacher know how grateful you were. (Note the phrasing: 
not how awful you feel about not having written a thank-you letter -- that 
makes it sound like a chore.)

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: GROUP DOESN'T WELCOME HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JOYCE BROTHERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I was sexually molested by my stepfather for three years 
starting when I was 9 years old. I blocked this all out of my memory until 
recently, when a shocking incident I won't describe made me recall it. 
Recently, I've joined a support group -- women who have experienced the same 
trauma as I. My husband, whom I love dearly, would like to accompany me to 
these meetings and I don't know how to explain that he isn't wanted. It's not 
that we're hostile, but it would be wrong. -- K.E. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR K.E.: As I'm sure you know, there are lasting effects of incest and those 
who survive and are able to live relatively normal lives, as you have, will 
always carry with them a certain distrust and a sense of extreme cautiousness 
about those of the opposite sex. It would be insensitive to the women in your 
support group for you to bring your husband. Even though you love and trust 
him, obviously they don't. 
</P>
<P>
It takes a long time for most incest victims to be able to discuss what 
happened to them and they certainly wouldn't be able to share their tragic past 
with strangers. Most women who have been sexually abused feel more comfortable 
with their own sex. Incidentally, this is also true of men who have been 
sexually abused in childhood. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure if you explain this to your husband he'll understand. Let him know how 
much you need this support group and how valuable it is to you and all the 
women who participate. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: A new kid in our neighborhood found some pornographic 
magazines in his father's room and, unfortunately, showed them to my 
15-year-old son. I'd certainly have preferred that he not be exposed to this 
kind of trash, but now, as his mother, I don't know how to erase the memories 
he must be carrying around in his mind. What he saw was not just "girlie stuff" 
but hard-core sadistic pornography. What can I do? -- W.P. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR W.P.: Youngsters are much more influenced by what they see in their homes 
day after day than they are by any single exposure to pornography. If they've 
been raised in a climate where men and women treat each other kindly and 
respectfully, the sadistic behavior typified in the photos may shock them, but 
they won't be tempted to imitate it. They'll be much more likely to be offended 
than to be titillated. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, this would be a time when your son's father would have a talk with 
him. However, if his father isn't around, and there's no surrogate father you 
trust, then it might be wise for you to point out that physical power and 
violence are not an appropriate part of sexuality. Any sexual act that demeans 
or humiliates one of the sexual partners is wrong and is actually destructive 
to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
You might also pick up the phone and have a talk with this boy's parents to let 
them know that you don't want your son to be exposed to this garbage.

PERTUSSIS REACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: If a child has had a bad reaction to the pertussis vaccine, should he 
not get any more shots? Or is it better to take the chance that the bad 
reaction won't happen again? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: For children who have had a bad reaction to the 
diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, a vaccine is available that does 
not contain the pertussis portion. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I can understand why aerobic exercises are supposed to be good for the heart 
and the lungs. What do all these people who do anaerobic exercises get out of 
them? 
</P>
<P>
A: The main purpose of anaerobic exercise is to increase muscle strength. The 
greatest benefits to overall health come from aerobic exercise. 
</P>
<P>
For Mrs. D.S., Montpelier, Vt.: Women who have reduced iron reserves have less 
energy and will tire faster during exercise.

A Havel Renaissance: In Britain, interest in the work of Czech 
playwright-turned-president Vaclav Havel has taken a dramatic upswing. Saturday 
night the BBC is airing "Sorry," the television film based on Havel's stage 
play, that stars Michael Crawford and was last broadcast in London in 1978. 
Havel's London-based literary agent said there have been at least 20 requests 
in the last month from people throughout the United Kingdom for the work of 
Havel, Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist president in 41 years. Next 
September, his play "Redevelopment" will be staged in Manchester at the Royal 
Exchange, a major regional theater. DANIEL CERONE

NBC, which rose from third place to a dominant first during the 1980s, closed 
out the decade in appropriate fashion, ratings from the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed 
Wednesday. The Peacock Network had eight shows in the Top 10 and scored its 
11th consecutive weekly win over rivals ABC and CBS. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way was a 61-minute runover into prime time of the 
Pittsburgh-Houston NFL playoff game last Sunday. For all of 1989, NBC said, its 
prime-time programs averaged a 14 rating, compared to 11.6 for ABC and 11.5 for 
CBS. The full list of weekly ratings is on Page 11. 
</P>
<P>
* NBC even won in the battle of decade-ending news retrospectives. "The 
Eighties," hosted by Tom Brokaw and Jane Pauley, ranked 27th among the week's 
83 prime-time programs. ABC's was 37th and CBS' was 54th. Among the nightly 
newscasts, however, ABC's "World News Tonight" continued its winning ways, 
attracting an average of 10.5 million homes, compared to 9.5 million for "NBC 
Nightly News" and 9.4 million for "CBS Evening News."

Settlement in CBS Suit: A federal judge approved Wednesday a $6-million 
settlement of a lawsuit filed by a CBS shareholder who claimed the network was 
mismanaged from 1983 to 1986. The lawsuit was brought in 1986 by Roger Minkoff, 
a real estate investor from the Virgin Islands who owns 12 CBS shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Nov. 28 settlement, in which the management of CBS Inc. admits no 
wrongdoing, will be paid by a network insurance policy. The settlement money, 
totaling $4.5 million, will go to the CBS treasury for an indirect benefit to 
shareholders. Minkoff's attorney will receive the remaining $1.5 million, with 
$15,000 of that going directly to Minkoff. Among the allegations in the suit 
were that CBS wasted corporate assets when it bought part of the Ziff-Davis 
Publishing Co. in 1985 for $362.5 million and that it was hurt by efforts to 
fend off a takeover attempt by Ted Turner in 1985. DANIEL CERONE

Soviet Update -- Film at 11:45: The Vremya TV news program, a fixture in the 
Soviet Union for 21 years with its once-a-day newscast at 9 p.m., now will be 
broadcast three times a day with two anchors, reflecting a more Western 
approach to TV news. "The format change is because of the increased flow in 
information," Ivan Ilyoshin, a senior editor of the Vremya (Time) program, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Soviet viewers for the first time saw an anchorman and anchorwoman 
reading the news under soft lights, sitting behind low desks. A third person 
reported sports. Vremya now will have half-hour TV news programs at 12:30, 6:30 
and 9 p.m., plus a news summary at 11:45 p.m. DANIEL CERONE

BAKER SERVES UP A MEDIOCRE SET AT LE CAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drummer Michael Baker's appearance leading a trio Tuesday night at Le Cafe in 
Sherman Oaks had more to do with his booking the gig than it did with his 
emergence as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
A sideman on the local jazz scene, Baker, albeit a capable player, maintained 
his sideman role in a setting dominated by pianist Billy Childs and bolstered 
by bassist Reggie Hamilton. While it was Baker who soloed the most and 
announced the tunes, four of the seven tunes served up during the group's 
opening set were from Childs' pen; the remaining three included a rather 
disjointed piece by Herbie Hancock and a pair of vocals from the pop bag. 
</P>
<P>
As a vocalist, Baker is undistinguished and indistinctive. Indeed, his cover of 
Leon Russell's "This Masquerade" was but a duplication of George Benson's 
mega-hit -- the only difference coming during a last verse in which Baker 
forgot the lyrics. Likewise, his rendition of Marvin Gaye's "What's Goin' On" 
was but a copy that left one longing for the original. 
</P>
<P>
The set started out with Childs' "Mt. Olympus," a funky piece composed of brief 
snippets of melody. Baker's insistent afterbeats and Hamilton's booming 
electric bass obscured the piano, rendering the piece unmemorable. Decibel 
problems plagued the Hancock piece as well. 
</P>
<P>
After the vocal excursions, the trio got down to some swing business with an 
attractive "Room 101," again from Childs. "Quiet Girl," another of the 
pianist's compositions, was a dark and moody ballad, with Childs lending a 
fugue-like quality to the lovely work. His solos were inspired and both Baker 
and Hamilton maintained a much-needed low profile. 
</P>
<P>
The group's collective profile became much higher during "Twilight Is Upon Us," 
a jazz-rock tune whose dramatic introduction soon gave away to a plodding 
rhythm and thunderous din. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, who availed himself of every opportunity to solo, will have to learn 
that leadership requires more than displaying an ability to dominate 
instrumentally. The gig could have belonged to Billy Childs, but he would have 
made more musical changes. A. JAMES LISKA

DEAR HELOISE: We are trying to cut out cholesterol in our diet. So when a 
recipe calls for a whole egg, I use two egg whites and save the egg yolks in a 
plastic bag. When the bag is full I cook the egg yolks in a greased microwave 
dish and set the cooked eggs outside for the animals. 
</P>
<P>
We live in the country in a wooded area. Raccoons, opossums and even foxes stop 
by for my egg casserole. 
</P>
<P>
 -- JULIANA, Fairview Heights, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JULIANA: This is a good idea, but when using the two egg whites in the 
place of the whole egg in recipes for baked goods, you will need to substitute 
one tablespoon of oil for 1 1/3 tablespoons of the liquid in your recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: Just recently, I found a recipe that my beloved grandmother had 
written many years ago. It suddenly dawned on me that possibly my grandchildren 
and their grandchildren would someday enjoy having and making something for 
their families that they remembered me making for them. 
</P>
<P>
I have begun writing different family recipes on 3x5-inch cards and enclosing 
them within each of their birthday cards. After I have departed this life, 
won't I be smiling if at a family reunion they would each be making and sharing 
those goodies in remembrance of things past. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I don't know how many others are like me, kind of disorganized. I 
keep a neat home but tend to stuff everything into my kitchen drawers. 
</P>
<P>
After cleaning out one drawer, I found two appliance instruction booklets I got 
when I purchased the appliances. That's when I decided to put all of them 
together in one book. I bought a loose-leaf binder, punched holes in some 
construction paper, put them in the book and pasted the back cover of each 
booklet to a page. 
</P>
<P>
Now when I need to know about my blender, stove, electric fry pan, etc., I have 
a handy file system I can get to in a minute. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When I unwrap a new stick of butter or margarine, rather than 
disposing of the wrapper, I fold it butter sides together and store it in a 
zipper-type plastic bag in my freezer. 
</P>
<P>
The next time a recipe calls for greased pans, I simply pull out one of the 
wrappers, grease the pan with it and toss it in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 -- THERESA, Punta Gorda, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I usually buy a couple of loaves of bread at a time and keep them 
in my freezer. When I run out of bread crumbs, I grate the frozen bread. 
</P>
<P>
I usually don't have stale bread on hand and using fresh bread can be a 
problem. This way is easy and fast. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I went to a dinner party recently and the hostess served sherbet 
for dessert, but what was so nice was that she used orange halves as serving 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
She cut the fruit in half and cleaned it out with a grapefruit knife and kept 
the shells frozen, then she filled them with sherbet. They looked so lovely and 
kept the sherbet cold. 
</P>
<P>
I'm going to use her idea and make some desserts using lemon and possibly 
grapefruit halves. Wouldn't sherbet look great in a half of a lemon? 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When making a cake, rather than drizzling icing on it, cut a 
chocolate bar in little pieces and put them on top of the cake while it's still 
warm. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy, quick and inexpensive and sure has delicious results. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: When you have leftover ham on the bone, place the bone in a large 
pot and cover it with water. Bring this to a boil and boil until all the meat 
falls off, then cool and skim off the fat. Place the ham and broth into small 
individual containers and freeze. These can be used to season beans, vegetables 
and a whole lot more. 
</P>

<P>
DEAR HELOISE: It gets harder and harder each year to find the perfect birthday 
gift for my wife. I decided this year would be different. I came up with the 
following idea and thought it was too good to keep to myself. 
</P>
<P>
My wife's birthday is on April 17. I took her out to dinner at her favorite 
restaurant and presented her with a small booklet of eight tickets. These 
entitled her to a dinner out for the remaining eight months of the year. Her 
gift is spread throughout the year, and she has something to look forward to 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
She also says she knows that we will spend at least one night a month out 
together. This may become a traditional birthday gift in our family. 
</P>
<P>
 -- TAD, San Diego 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: If you don't have one of those fancy salad molds that unmolds 
itself, I have an easy way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Dip the mold in hot water to loosen the gelatin and go around the edge with a 
thin knife. Place lettuce leaves on top of the gelatin with the leaves folded 
down around the edges of the mold. Place the serving plate (upside down) on top 
of the lettuce. Now hold the mold and the plate firmly and turn the entire 
thing over so that the mold is on top and the plate is on the bottom. Shake the 
mold gently in a circular motion while holding the plate and the mold in place. 
</P>
<P>
The salad should drop down and be in place perfectly on the lettuce.

FOOD BRIEFS: A FRANK NEW MEDIUM FOR ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There has been a revolutionary breakthrough in the frankfurter world, according 
to a meat industry publication. A Chicago-based firm has announced that it has 
developed frankfurter casings that can carry messages, logos or labeling 
claims. Now link lovers can enjoy advertising or promotion, as well as mustard, 
on their frankfurters. 
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Viskase Corp. made available the versatile enclosures to meat 
processors after receiving the required federal approval, Lean Trimmings 
reports. The newsletter, published by the Western States Meat Assn., stated 
that only the length of the frankfurter limits the messages or words that can 
be printed on the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising-weary consumers can imagine that food companies will rush to get 
their brand names emblazoned on the franks. But there is also tremendous 
marketing potential for restaurants, street vendors and sports teams, the 
newsletter stated. Self-promoters can even order personalized frankfurters: a 
natural for the various hotel, airline and casino outposts of the Donald Trump 
empire, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
A Viskase official said that "the (frankfurter) itself can be used as a 
communications medium. For the first time, selling messages can be communicated 
to the consumer outside the package -- on the grill, on the plate and in the 
bun." 
</P>
<P>
The casings are being marketed to meat companies as E-Z Mark Nojax, a cellulose 
enclosure that will transfer any message to the link, according to the trade 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
The newsletter speculates that manufacturers may specifically target children 
with the messages in order to "establish brand preference early" in life. 
</P>
<P>
Attention McDonald's -- Next Tuesday the Campbell Soup Co. will celebrate the 
biggest milestone in its history: production of the 20 billionth can of tomato 
soup. To mark the occasion, the firm plans a soup-sipping celebration in 
Minneapolis, which leads the nation in soup consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The first can of the distinctive red and white labeled tomato soup was sold in 
1897, long before the late Andy Warhol recognized the unique design in his 
famous painting. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, in complimenting its own achievement, said that the product's success 
was due to its "special brand of comfort and warmth." 
</P>
<P>
Getting Fat Out -- The California Milk Advisory Board hopes to be as lucky with 
its new product as Campbell was with tomato soup. The trade group will 
introduce "Extra Light" milk Monday in supermarkets throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The dairy product is meant to appeal to the health-conscious with its 1% milk 
fat content. The formulation contains 50% less fat than what is now called 
low-fat milk. However, nonfat milk, at 0.1% fat, remains the leanest dairy 
beverage available. 
</P>
<P>
Extra Light is being marketed by the board as the "milk of the 1990s." The 
South San Francisco-based group says it is the first new formulation of milk in 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
The development follows by about one year a recommendation from the California 
Medical Assn. that the state force dairies to reduce fat levels in milk as a 
means of reducing saturated fat levels in the diet. The group proposed that 
low-fat milk contain only 1% fat and that whole milk be reduced to 2% milk fat 
from its current 3.5% level. 
</P>
<P>
Quick Cooking's Future -- As many as 75% of the nation's households are 
equipped with microwave ovens and the food industry is spending more on 
research to specially design products for the process, according to an industry 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Food Technologists estimates that computers will be 
incorporated into microwaves, allowing the ovens to be programmed with 
extensive cookbook-type information. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, such a feature would automatically set the oven to the 
appropriate power levels and cooking times for a particular food. One such 
computerized cookbook would be able to determine a product's weight and the 
amount of moisture in the food and cook accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
The combination microwave-convection oven will also become more commonplace, 
according to the Chicago-based institute. These appliances offer the best of 
both worlds in being able to cook foods rapidly and crisp or brown the exterior 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers are also in the process of redesigning product labels 
specifically for the microwave. Even those items that prove difficult to 
microwave -- such as meat with internal bones -- will carry directions for 
proper preparation and heating. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, while speed is certainly the primary convenience of the 
microwave, it still requires almost as much energy to prepare a single meal in 
these fast cookers as it does to prepare a similar meal on the stove, according 
to the group. 
</P>
<P>
One example of industry efforts to make microwave labeling more user friendly 
is a recent project by the Glass Packaging Institute. The Washington-based 
group announced in 1989 that it has created a new symbol indicating those 
products packed in glass that are microwaveable as they are. 
</P>
<P>
The design resembles a jar being penetrated in its center by a microwave. The 
impetus for the new logo was the success of Kraft's Cheez Whiz in a 
microwaveable glass. The institute's polling also indicated that glass is the 
preferred cooking vessel material for the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
Eating Green -- Federal researchers have found that diets high in green 
vegetables may lower an individual's risk of cancer. The association is 
particularly true of the dark green varieties such as kale and spinach, a 
report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture stated. 
</P>
<P>
The agency's Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Md., discovered the 
link during work on determining which foods should be incorporated into cancer 
prevention studies. 
</P>
<P>
"The greener the vegetable is, the higher its level of chlorophyll, which also 
means higher levels of carotenoids," said Frederick Khachik, a USDA researcher. 
</P>
<P>
People with elevated blood levels of carotenoids -- such as beta carotene -- 
have been found to have lower rates of cancer than the general population. 
</P>
<P>
The survey analyzed the carotenoid levels in six vegetables common to the 
United States and another nine found in the Cook Islands of the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The results showed that kale grown in this country had the highest 
concentrations of carotenoids, or more than twice the levels found in Chinese 
cabbage from the Cook Islands or domestic spinach. Two other U.S. produced 
items -- broccoli and green beans -- were also found to have the beneficial 
compounds but not in amounts as high as kale. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers also reported that most carotenoids found in food are heat stable 
and not reduced in the various cooking processes. 
</P>
<P>
"Numerous studies have demonstrated that a high concentration of some of these 
carotenoids in human (blood) are correlated with lower incidence of certain 
forms of cancer and therefore may be beneficial in prevention of cancer," the 
USDA report stated. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers' recommendation: "Eat your greens."

ABOUT WINE: SUCCESSFUL NAPA WINE MAKER FINDS NEW CHALLENGES ALONG CENTRAL COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PASO ROBLES 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a kid fresh out of college treks to a media center such as Los Angeles or 
New York seeking to break into television, the advice is always predictable: Go 
to the boonies and work for a 6-watt station to get some experience, then come 
back here. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, seeing Chuck Ortman working in Paso Robles seems incongruous. 
Ortman has been in the wine business 21 years; he was a successful and 
respected wine maker in the Napa Valley -- the vinous equivalent of New York or 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months ago he moved to Paso Robles, in San Luis Obispo County, which 
is rarely compared with the Napa Valley. Why would Ortman, who just turned 50, 
make such a move? 
</P>
<P>
"I caught the dream," he said the other day. "I know it sounds trite, but it's 
a new challenge. I feel like a kid again." 
</P>
<P>
The project that Ortman heads down here, 300-some-odd miles south of the Napa 
Valley, is called Meridian, a winery that within a year or two will, I expect, 
become the next superstar winery in the state. But unlike the other superstar 
wineries that offer you glitz and charge you plenty for it, Meridian offers 
excellent wine at a very moderate price. 
</P>
<P>
The first Ortman wine under a new label is being shipped to market this week. 
It is a 1988 Meridian Chardonnay with a designation of Santa Barbara County. It 
sports a label featuring a painting by Chicago artist Thomas Gaithman, and it's 
one of the best Central Coast wines I have tasted, a wonderfully balanced 
effort that has faint notes of vanilla and cream inside a more delicate citrus 
and tropical fruit aroma and a fresh, soft, appealing finish. 
</P>
<P>
Based on its quality, this wine should sell for $13. Maybe more, given the 
rambunctious pricing policies of wine makers these days. The '88 Meridian 
Chardonnay is $9. And with the industrywide discounts that are typically 
available, it could be seen for less than $8 in some places. 
</P>
<P>
One reason it is being sold for so little, compared with its quality, is that 
the Meridian project is the third major one of Wine World Inc., the U.S. 
division of Nestle S.A. of Switzerland. Wine World is the parent company of 
Beringer Vineyards, and today Beringer is the most energetic wine company in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In the last three years alone, Beringer has spent an estimated $85 million for 
wine and vineyard property around the state, and president Mike Moone has said 
the firm doesn't expect to make its money back overnight. 
</P>
<P>
There is another, subtler reason Meridian wines won't be high-priced. Moone 
can't afford to see a wine from California's Central Coast selling for more 
than his Napa Valley wines from Beringer, and since Beringer's regular Napa 
Valley Chardonnay sells for about $10, Meridian must be less. 
</P>
<P>
Another '88 Meridian Chardonnay worth looking for is designated Edna Valley 
($12.50), a broader, richer wine with marvelous structure. 
</P>
<P>
Nestle got into the wine business two decades ago when it bought a 
deteriorating Napa Valley property, Beringer Brothers. Under the brilliant 
wine-making stewardship of the late Myron Nightingale, Beringer became a 
gemstone. 
</P>
<P>
About five years ago, Beringer envisioned a boon in fine wine, and the company 
began to invest heavily in other wine regions. One of the first new 
acquisitions came in 1986 when Beringer bought Souverain in Sonoma County for 
$10 million, changing its name to Chateau Souverain. Then Beringer bought the 
old Italian Swiss Colony Winery in Asti at the northern end of the county for 
$6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Next came the purchase of 2,875 acres of some of the best vineyard land in the 
Central Coast -- three parcels in the Santa Barbara County area. Those deals 
cumulatively figure to have cost Beringer another $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1988, Beringer bought Estrella River Winery, 90 miles north of its 
vineyards in Santa Barbara County, to use as a wine-making facility. The winery 
cost $13 million. And to establish a new image for the winery, Beringer bought 
the Meridian name from Ortman, who had developed it with a line of wines, and 
Ortman accepted the post of full-time wine maker. 
</P>
<P>
Now add in vineyard development costs (estimated at $20 million statewide), 
construction costs at Beringer, Chateau Souverain and Meridian (estimate: $50 
million), and you get the picture: a company on the move. It now owns more than 
5,000 acres of vineyard land, has contracts for thousands of additional acres 
of top-quality fruit, and markets wine under five different brands (including 
Napa Ridge and Los Hermanos). 
</P>
<P>
Ortman couldn't pass up the chance to be a part of this freight train, and it 
was a symbiotic relationship. Ortman brings to Meridian a rock-solid reputation 
as a brilliant Chardonnay craftsman with a wealth of experience dealing with a 
multitude of different Chardonnay characteristics because he has worked with so 
many Chardonnay producers. 
</P>
<P>
Here he works with three vineyards that, taken as a whole, would make 750,000 
cases of wine. There are only 25,000 cases of the first Meridian Chardonnay; 
the rest of the grapes go to Beringer for Napa Ridge, Los Hermanos and any 
other needs the company has. 
</P>
<P>
The largest vineyard, 2,196 acres, is called White Hills (formerly called 
Rancho San Antonio). The Chardonnay here gives off a fascinating perfume, an 
aroma not unlike kiwi fruit. There are 1,000 acres of Chardonnay planted here. 
</P>
<P>
The 371-acre Cat Canyon Vineyard, formerly called Los Olivos, is loaded with 
limestone. Chardonnay from here (off 300 acres) produces wine with a Chablis, 
lemon, limestoney, earth and spice character. 
</P>
<P>
At the warmer, 308-acre Riverbench Vineyard, in Foxen Canyon, the 220 acres of 
Chardonnay produce a pineapply fruit character and give the wine body and 
fullness. 
</P>
<P>
Ortman noted that if a new wine maker without broad wine-making skill had been 
given these three vineyards to deal with, some of the scents might have been 
confusing. But he said that with his background with a wide variety of styles 
of Chardonnay fruit, he was perfectly suited for this job. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see a characteristic in a wine, I can say, 'Oh, yeah, this reminds me 
of the fruit I had at Shafer in '84,' or 'This is like the stuff I worked with 
at St. Clement.' So I know how to deal with the different elements." 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Ortman began in the wine business in 1968 as a "cellar rat" for one of 
the industry's pioneers, Joe Heitz at Heitz Cellars. Ortman never had any 
formal training as a wine maker; Heitz taught him. In 1971 Ortman was hired as 
wine maker at Spring Mountain Vineyards and stayed there through 1979, then 
struck out on his own as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
By then he had developed a sense of proportion about Chardonnay that can be 
confusing on first sip. For about two years, I didn't know what to make of 
Ortman Chardonnays, and only later did I get the idea, which is that the wine 
will be a trace lean and austere when it's released, but with time in bottle, 
the wine takes on a glow you rarely get from bigger, richer, more top-heavy 
wines. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Ortman's clients over the years have changed style, but many have kept 
their Chardonnays close to his ideal. Among them are Monticello, Fisher (he 
still consults with wine maker Max Gasiewicz), Far Niente, Shafer, Keenan, 
Cain, St. Clement, St. Andrews, Chateau Bouchaine, Perret, Colby, Smothers, 
Tudal, and Staton Hills in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
After producing wine under a Charles Ortman label in 1979, Chuck developed 
Meridian in 1984, producing only Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
At Meridian, Ortman will also make Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Pinot Noir. He 
is also experimenting with a number of other varieties growing in the nearly 
3,000 acres of vines under his control and managed by Bob Steinhauer, one of 
the industry's top viticulturalists. I have tasted a few of these wines (most 
will not be released for another year), and they are actually more exciting 
than the Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny thing is that I had never made Syrah before, but I make one now and 
I'm more excited than I've been in years." (The Syrah is a sensational wine; 
it'll be released in about a year.) 
</P>
<P>
Tom Peterson is another beneficiary of Beringer's commitment to quality, but 
instead of working with thousands of acres of vineyard land owned by the 
company, he gets to choose which privately owned vineyards he wants to get 
fruit from. And then Beringer pays top dollar to get it. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, stories have abounded about Beringer (Chateau Souverain 
in this case) having signed a deal to get the grapes off another top vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, using new equipment and new aging barrels, Peterson's program is 
reversing itself to one of quality. And again the prices are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
I sampled the lovely 1988 Chardonnay ($9) from Chateau Souverain the other day 
and found lovely, subtle tropical fruit and a soft, appealing aftertaste. The 
1988 Reserve (not yet priced) is a richer wine, but with more finesse, with 
lemony elements. 
</P>
<P>
Also exciting was the 1988 Sauvignon Blanc ($7), with a classic melon 
characteristic and none of the overt grassiness that some people find 
bothersome. 
</P>
<P>
Better still, however, were the new red wines, notably the 1987 Zinfandel ($9), 
a spicy, blackberryish wine, and the 1986 and 1987 Cabernets ($9), both of 
which have a kind of Bordeaux-like elegance, though the former had more of the 
black cherry and chocolate spice scents. 
</P>
<P>
Peterson soon will have out 1988 Zinfandels from old Geyserville vines, 
adjacent to the winery located in the northern end of Sonoma County; a 
Chardonnay emphasizing the spice of the Carneros, at the southern end of the 
county; and other wines from other carefully selected blocks of vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Both Peterson and Ortman love to talk about the construction going on at their 
properties. Neither talks in specifics about how much Moone is spending on 
these projects, but both simply nod when $10 million is mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
At Meridian, located five miles east of 101 at Paso Robles, a new wing to the 
building will house the new barrels. (Estrella River, short of cash for a 
decade, had not added much new oak to its winery over the years, and none of it 
the expensive French oak.) An archway will greet visitors to a large, airy 
tasting room. 
</P>
<P>
(The Estrella River name, by the way, was retained by Cliff Giacobine, and 
those wines will be produced at another facility.) 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's facility will have a tree-lined driveway leading up to a newly 
redesigned Chateau Souverain with a new roof, new siding, landscaped walkways, 
and a new tasting room. The winery now boasts one of the best restaurants north 
of San Francisco, featuring the brilliant creations of chef Gary Danko.

DEAR MARY: In spite of the changes I have made and the huge reduction in 
calories, cholesterol, fat and sodium, most people would not be able to tell 
the difference between the original and my revision. I took advantage of the 
reduced-fat products now in the markets to lower the calories and fat from the 
sour cream and the cheese. Using egg whites instead of a whole egg eliminates 
the cholesterol from the yolk, and nonfat milk instead of whole milk also 
worked beautifully.

THE KITCHEN CABINET: NEW YEAR SEES RETURN OF FAVORITE COOKWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Searching for a good contemporary cookware? I used to recommend All-Clad 
cookware with confidence, having proven its cooking efficiency and cleaning 
ease. However when the line started disappearing from market shelves, I was 
disheartened. And so were some cookware shop owners. The good news from 
All-Clad Metalcrafters Inc., of Canonsburg, Penn., is that its 
precision-crafted cookware line is back in full production using all new 
machinery, thanks to the new takeover. Favored by professional chefs, the 
multi-ply cookware had limited distribution in the past and wasn't widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Now here's the only American cookware company (and one of only two in the 
world) that produces and bonds its own metals under one roof. As a matter of 
fact, it is the only company in this country that manufactures four types of 
cookware: copper, anodized aluminum, aluminum and stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
Every piece starts with a highly polished surface interior of 18/10 stainless 
steel bonded onto a thick core of pure aluminum for even heat distribution and 
retention. These layers are bonded to a wear-resistant outer layer, which could 
be any of the four metal types previously mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
For old-world charm and elegance, there's Cop-R-Chef ($366 for five-piece 
starter set, $160 for oval au gratin and $150 for oval omelet pan). It's tough 
on the outside with an extra thick copper layer and easy to clean with its thin 
stainless steel cooking surface that never needs to re-tinned. The solid brass 
handles are designed to stay cool even after lengthy cooking periods. Another 
style is LTD. ($260 for five-piece set), featuring a charcoal black exterior 
made of hardcoat anodized aluminum with resistance to scratch and chipping. One 
of my favorite open stock vessels here is the wok with a long handle and 
brightly polished domed cover. 
</P>
<P>
Master-Chef Cookware ($252 for six-piece set) offers abrasion-resistant brushed 
aluminum alloy exterior and same stainless steel exterior and aluminum core. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's Magna-Core Multi-purpose Cookware ($220 for five-piece set), 
which has seven bonded layers of magnetic and conductive metals, making it 
ideal for induction cooking as well as conventional gas and electric ranges. 
The pieces are highly attractive with their shiny steel polish. 
</P>
<P>
 All All-Clad cookware types are available at Jordano's (Santa Barbara) and 
Williams Sonoma. The LTD cookware is available at Bullock's and Montana 
Mercantile (Santa Monica). Bed, Bath and Beyond (West L.A.) has Master Chef and 
LTD cookware. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Who says microwave dinnerware and cookware have to be plain white ceramic or 
plastic utensil? Go for more sophisticated porcelain service with microwave 
foods, whether they be dishes reheated or started from scratch. The new wave of 
microwave and conventional-oven safe cookware are available in pretty pastel 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of Villeroy &amp; Boch patterns would be happy to know about the 
additional new pieces that have been adapted for microwave cooking. Used with 
matching dinnerware groupings, or as a complement to other china, the patterns 
are Albertina, Mariposa and the popular Amapola and Basket (from $12.50 to 
$175). The cookware collection includes a variety of convenient sizes from 
single serving dishes to large casseroles and baking dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeroy &amp; Boch Microwave Cookware are available at Villeroy &amp; Boch 
Creation store (Beverly Hills) and Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fairwinds Dinnerware (from $40 for 20-piece set) consists of a wide variety of 
white porcelain pieces with fine floral prints in varied colors around the rim. 
All are dishwasher safe, does not stain and detergent proof. They can go from 
freezer to oven to table and retain heat well. 
</P>
<P>
Additional serving items are included in Fairwinds' Porcelain Plus line, which 
are designed with soft round corners that prevent hot spots when microwaving. 
The open stock units consist of various size rounded casseroles with cover, 
covered soup dishes, stackable cooker, divided dinner plates, beverage server, 
rectangular bakers, mugs and squarish hot lunch plates. The pieces are break 
and chip resistant; also the company offers a one-year warranty against 
manufacturing defects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairwinds Dinnerware and Porcelain Plus are available at May Company. 
</P>
<P>
Another porcelain microwaveable set is Noritake's freezer to oven to table 
collection called Gala Cuisine. The full range covers regular china pieces 
including an oval vegetable baker, a quiche/pie dish, a souffle/serving bowl, 
shallow as well as deep covered casseroles, roaster/baker. There are five 
patterns in the Gala Cuisine line, basically white with colored patterns: 
Copper Bud in blue and copper-red trim, multihued American Flowers, Clearlake 
with simple scalloped blue lines, blue Dutch Tile and the attractive pastel 
floral Coram pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Noritake's Gala Cuisine is available at Greco Gifts (San Pedro), Robinson's, 
Broadway, May Co. and Buffum's.

CURBSIDE TROUBLE;

<P>
CATERING TRUCKS REGULATIONS UNDER SCRUTINY; VENDORS RALLY TO PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For two years, Delores Sanchez has been dishing up burritos, carnitas, tacos 
and hot coffee from a catering truck near the Figueroa Market in Cypress Park. 
</P>
<P>
"She has two babies," said Jose Luis Martinez, who was helping Sanchez chop 
meat one recent morning. "She has to work for them." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is pleased with Sanchez's choice of professions. Complaints 
about catering trucks from East Los Angeles to Brentwood have led to new calls 
at Los Angeles City Hall for stiff regulations on the rolling restaurants, 
which have become a roadside institution in many parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
In East Los Angeles and elsewhere, some restaurant owners complain that the 
trucks compete unfairly with them, and merchants and residents say they 
monopolize parking spaces. Residents also complain about litter, crowded 
curbsides, and in some cases, late-night revelry. 
</P>
<P>
"The trucks are a real nuisance to neighborhoods," said Councilwoman Gloria 
Molina, who had bottles tossed at her recently when she asked a driver on 
Figueroa Street near Avenue 43 to move his truck. "In our neighborhood it 
creates public drinking. With the taco or whatever they are purchasing, they 
also have their beer they bought at the liquor store. We have to eliminate it." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council is expected to consider a proposed ordinance this 
month that would restrict catering truck stops to one half-hour. Other 
proposals being considered by the council would ban the trucks from residential 
streets and sharply increase fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of this is to allow the industry to continue, but to regulate it in 
a meaningful way," said Councilman Marvin Braude, who proposed the half-hour 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, who heads the council's transportation committee, said 
the trucks have assumed a role far larger than city officials envisioned when 
they last imposed regulations more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They were intended to go visit construction sites," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
But catering truck drivers say times have changed. Southern Californians value 
convenience, they say, and that extends beyond the construction and factory 
workers looking for a cold soda during a break. As a result, the area has grown 
into the catering truck capital of the country, with 5,000 trucks licensed in 
Los Angeles County alone. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the drivers say they would be forced out of business if the city 
imposed new restrictions on their hours because they depend on one stop for 
their livelihood. Sanchez, as an example, typically spends five to six hours a 
day on Huron Street. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what we would do," said Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
In Wilmington, Sabado Ramirez expressed similar gloom. "I would have to go to 
factories looking for people who want lunch," said Ramirez, who parks his truck 
near auto salvage yards on Blinn Avenue. "But that is real hard. There are a 
lot of catering trucks." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, about 50 trucks circled Los Angeles City Hall and several dozen 
drivers and family members marched on the sidewalk outside the Spring Street 
entrance to protest the proposed restrictions. The picketers said they belong 
to the Independent Catering Truck Owners Assn., a month-old group of 300 
drivers who do not work for large catering companies. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Sosa, a driver from East Los Angeles and president of the group, said the 
large catering companies control most traditional routes at factories and 
office buildings, forcing independent drivers to look for business on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to stay five or six hours at one location to make a living," Sosa 
said. "Some of us park near hospitals where there are different break times. 
You can't just park there for a half hour and move on. You would miss most of 
your customers." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Ramirez, executive director of Industrial Caterers Assn., said his 
organization is also concerned about the proposed restrictions and will attempt 
to work with the city over the next month to soften them. The group, which 
represents large catering companies, accounts for about half of the catering 
trucks licensed by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Los Angeles Police Department has a lot better things to do than 
go around and bother caterers who are trying to feed people," said Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
One driver in Wilmington said he feared the new regulations are racially 
motivated, a charge city officials deny. "A lot of people don't like Hispanic 
people," said Pablo Vargas, who has parked his truck for two years on Blinn. 
"They don't like us working here." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters outside City Hall on Wednesday -- almost all of whom were Latino 
-- also said the new restrictions would be discriminatory. Several carried 
placards proclaiming, "Do not violate our civil rights" and "discrimination 
against Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to better ourselves," said Sosa. "But it seems they want to keep us 
down." About 90% of those in the catering truck industry in Los Angeles are 
Latino, according to the Industrial Caterers Assn. The group estimates that the 
industry employs about 8,000 Latinos, most of whom frequent construction sites 
and factories. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Molina said at a recent council meeting that it is important the 
city craft a "balanced law" that does not hurt operators who are not causing 
problems. "Let's get those that have been abusing a privilege they've had for a 
long time," Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
Catering trucks in the city of Los Angeles already fall under a series of 
regulations, including requirements that they not park within 100 feet of 
intersections and restaurant entrances, or within 200 feet of schools and 
freeway ramps. Sales are also restricted to the vehicle's curb side, and each 
truck is required to provide a trash can. 
</P>
<P>
The city attempted to impose tougher requirements in the 1970s, at one point 
limiting curbside sales to 10 minutes. But catering truck drivers successfully 
challenged the restrictions in court, and later, Mayor Tom Bradley vetoed an 
ordinance that he said was too restrictive. Bradley has not taken a position on 
the current proposals. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, Councilman Braude said his office has "carefully 
researched" the issue in hopes of avoiding the pitfalls of the past. The 
10-minute restriction was struck down in 1975 because it did not specify how 
far a truck must move after the period elapsed. In his current proposal, Braude 
has suggested that the truck be required to move at least one-half mile after a 
one-half hour stop. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. Henry Morris said the state Motor Vehicle Code authorizes the 
city to impose restrictions on catering trucks so long as they are based on 
public safety concerns. It will not be difficult to meet such a test with the 
proposed new regulations, he said, because many trucks pose potential hazards 
for pedestrians and motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly true around peak times, such as breaks or lunch," Morris 
said. "You have a lot of people for whatever reason are pressed for time, and 
they need to move. . . . An individual could be forced, perhaps due to the 
density of the crowd, to traverse the roadway. Any time you have that kind of 
situation, you have potential for hazard to people." 
</P>
<P>
Other Los Angeles area cities already impose tough restrictions on catering 
trucks, with Glendale's 4-year-old ordinance regarded as one of the most 
restrictive. Trucks there can park on public streets for just 10 minutes unless 
they receive a special permit from the city. City Clerk Aileen Boyle said only 
five of the 100 catering trucks there have been given extensions, ranging from 
one hour to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale law, like the proposed Los Angeles restrictions, does not deal 
directly with trucks that park on private property. Glendale and Los Angeles 
officials said other city ordinances, such as building and zoning codes, 
already restrict food sales on private property. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Los Angeles, problems with the trucks are as diverse as the 
communities they serve. On the Westside, the 22-foot-long modified Chevrolet 
Step Vans dish up breakfast and lunch to gardeners, swimming pool cleaners, 
painters and repairmen in affluent Brentwood neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
But some residents in those neighborhoods don't think much of the fast-food 
road shows. Along Kenter Avenue, where several caterers set up shop every day, 
homeowners want them out. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even get out of my driveway," said Nancy Real, a resident of Kenter, 
which is often cluttered with pickup trucks and vans as workers pull over for a 
bite to eat. "I have a little boy I take to school, and twice we have almost 
been hit by cars." 
</P>
<P>
In Cypress Park and other parts of northeast Los Angeles, residents don't worry 
about gardeners blocking their driveways. They say they are concerned about 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
Some trucks have become hazards in those areas because of rowdy crowds they 
attract, city officials said. Shortly after 6 p.m., the trucks line up outside 
liquor stores and bars, often becoming a gathering place for "riffraff," as one 
city official described it. Many trucks remain in one place six to eight hours, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Some catering truck operators, however, complain that the city is going after 
the wrong guy. "We don't sell the alcohol," one driver said. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with catering trucks on L Street near Avalon Boulevard in Wilmington 
led to a city experiment several months ago that harbor-area Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores said has flopped. City officials posted "No Parking" signs along a 
stretch of L Street, eliminating the catering trucks but also wiping out 
valuable curbside parking for visitors at a nearby senior citizens center. 
</P>
<P>
Flores has proposed an alternate pilot program for Wilmington, which would keep 
catering trucks off public streets by restricting them to construction and 
industrial sites. In addition, parking on streets where catering trucks have 
been a problem would be posted with one-hour limits. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants in downtown Wilmington had complained to Flores about a proliferation 
of catering trucks, including some that sell clothing, toys and other non-food 
items in addition to the routine tacos and soda. Laura Warren said the trucks 
are an eyesore and compete with local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"They belong at the docks, or construction sites or at a warehouse, and then 
only for a limited time," said Warren, a real estate agent at All American 
Realty. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she favors larger fines for violators -- currently, fines range 
from $25 to $100 -- and limits on how long trucks can stay in one location. But 
she said the city will have to find some way to make the proposed half-hour 
restriction stick. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be difficult to enforce this without having a police officer standing 
there full time," she said. "You may just have a turnover of trucks one after 
another." 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez of the caterers association said the council must be careful not to 
penalize an entire industry because of what he described as a few bad caterers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people are not going out there to break the law," he said. "They are 
providing a service to their clientele."

DEUKMEJIAN OFTEN FINDS APPOINTEES CLOSE TO HOME

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Gov. George Deukmejian takes a number to wait in line at a barbershop near 
his Long Beach home, he gets his hair cut by Robert O. Boulding, a member of 
the Board of Barber Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
When he attends services at All Saints' Episcopal Church in Long Beach, 
Deukmejian listens to sermons delivered by the Rev. William A. Thompson, 
chairman of the Board of Behavioral Science Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
When the governor returns to his Belmont Shore neighborhood, he can wave hello 
to James A. Woodward, who lives across the street and is a Deukmejian appointee 
to the Medical Assistance Commission, which oversees Medi-Cal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Living near the governor seems to be one of the easiest ways to land a job on a 
state board or commission. Based on a review of 2,923 current members of boards 
and commissions obtained from the governor's office, Deukmejian's 90803 ZIP 
code has the highest number of appointees -- 26 -- of any in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
After the governor's, the county's other ZIP codes with clout are: well-to-do 
communities on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in ZIP code 90274, with 16 
appointees. Next in line, with 13 appointees, is ZIP code 90049, covering 
Westwood, Brentwood and Bel-Air in West Los Angeles. Beverly Hills' 90210 ZIP 
code and another section of Long Beach in ZIP code 90815 follow, with 11 
appointees each. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor feels the state ends just south of Long Beach, but he's not 
exactly sure where," cracked Robert C. Fellmeth, a University of San Diego law 
professor and expert on state boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Terrance Flanigan, a San Diego native who is Deukmejian's appointments 
secretary, minimized the degree to which geography enters into the selection 
process. Said Flanigan: "If you had a governor from the Central Valley or from 
somewhere in Northern California . . . it probably would surprise no one if a 
large number of appointments were from that area." 
</P>
<P>
As governor, "you can appoint people to positions who you are familiar with" 
and whose judgment you rely upon. "This is one of the prerogatives you have as 
a governor," Flanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County -- with an estimated 30% of the state's population -- has 
about 500 appointments -- only about 16% of the statewide total, according to a 
review of the figures. 
</P>
<P>
The ZIP codes with the highest number of Deukmejian appointees are in the 
Sacramento area, where many officials move to serve in full-time posts. For 
example, one Sacramento ZIP code area has 78 appointees. 
</P>
<P>
In the Glendale area, about 55 Deukmejian appointees currently are serving on 
boards and commissions. The top ZIP codes are 90027 in the Los Feliz area and 
91011 in La Canada Flintridge, each with eight appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Glendale area appointees are Kenneth F. Kevorkian, a Los Feliz area 
businessman, who sits on the state Transportation Commission, and Glendale 
Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg, a member of the Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
Bremberg, who is active in Republican politics, said she would expect 
Deukmejian to appoint people he knows. "If I were the governor and if there was 
a choice between someone I know or someone I don't know, I'd pick someone I 
know," she said, because she'd know them "warts and all." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Kevorkian, who also is on the Superspeed Ground Transportation 
Commission which is trying to develop fast train service between Las Vegas and 
Anaheim, said his father and Deukmejian's father grew up together and he has 
known the governor for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Kevorkian said he has chatted with Deukmejian once or twice about the 
commission. "I've never exercised any influence with the governor. I don't go 
to him in the form of a power figure. He's not the type who would be receptive 
to that type of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian must fill hundreds of spots on about 375 boards and commissions. 
Some are low-profile, part-time panels such as the Board of Home Furnishings, 
for which members are paid $100 a meeting plus expenses. Others are 
high-profile, full-time, policy-making bodies such as the Public Utilities 
Commission, whose members earn $83,868 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with about two dozen appointees provide an insight into the various 
ways that Deukmejian fills slots in his Administration. Capturing a 
gubernatorial appointment can be as easy as popping into Boulding's Long Beach 
barbershop when the governor is having his hair trimmed. For others, the task 
is more difficult, prompting them to enlist friends and political movers and 
shakers to lobby the governor's office on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
A seat on even the most arcane board can be a political prize that signals 
clout, access to the governor or prestige. It also can mean that an appointee 
has expertise in a specialized field or is close to the governor's conservative 
Republican philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach appointees, in particular, may have a more parochial agenda -- to 
help a neighbor whose political star they have watched rise since he was 
elected to the Assembly in 1962. Many met Deukmejian when they moved to the 
comfortable Belmont Shore section of Long Beach, launched careers, began 
families and joined service clubs, the PTA and other groups. Some of their 
children were baby-sitters for his children. One appointee's husband coached 
Deukmejian's son's baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also had business ties to some of his appointees. Fred Riedman, 
Deukmejian's former law partner, sits on the Board of the Museum of Science and 
Industry. Another former law partner, Malcolm M. Lucas, was named by Deukmejian 
as chief justice of the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Long Beach appointees are in much lower-profile, unpaid positions. 
Nonetheless, with 67 appointments, Long Beach has seven more appointments than 
even San Diego, California's second-largest city, with more than twice the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Fellmeth, director of the USD Center for Public Interest Law, said it is not 
surprising that Deukmejian has picked a high number of state officials from 
Long Beach. Knowledge of an applicant, he said, is a critical factor in 
selecting political appointees. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Thompson, who officiated at the wedding of Deukmejian's daughter, 
Leslie, agreed. "Frankly, my interpretation of it is, when you have some 
appointments to make . . . it's probably only natural that you seek out people 
who you have some familiarity with," he said. Thompson sits on the board that 
certifies social workers and licenses other types of counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Despite an application and screening process designed to find the best 
candidates for the jobs, Flanigan, the governor's appointments secretary, 
acknowledged that on occasion a decision hinges on timing and circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of David G. Camp. 
</P>
<P>
Camp, who owned a menswear store, met Deukmejian when he was a Belmont Shore 
lawyer. His daughter was a baby-sitter for the Deukmejian family. In a recent 
interview, Camp said that after Deukmejian's 1982 election victory, he was 
approached about an appointment but was too busy with his business. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, after Camp had sold his store, he bumped into Deukmejian at 
Boulding's Belmont Shore barbershop. As they waited for a haircut, the governor 
and Camp discussed politics and Deukmejian's future. When Deukmejian settled 
into the barber chair, Camp said, Boulding asked the governor: "How about Dave 
filling a vacancy on the barber board?" 
</P>
<P>
Camp recalled that the governor asked him whether he would be interested in the 
post. Camp replied positively and about three days later got a letter 
announcing the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan cautioned: "That's certainly not how all the appointments are made," 
but joked, "What better advice can you get?" than from your barber. 
</P>
<P>
Boulding said he has cut the governor's hair regularly since the early 1970s. 
Because Deukmejian stays in Sacramento much of the time, he gives the governor 
a trim only about four or five times a year. "We're not an appointment shop," 
Boulding said, so the governor takes a number and waits in line like any other 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
Boulding, who moved from Long Beach to El Toro 10 years ago, said that about 
six months after Deukmejian was elected, "he was in on a Saturday morning and 
asked me if I would be interested in serving on the Board of Barber Examiners." 
</P>
<P>
It was almost as easy for a Deukmejian neighbor, James Woodward, who markets 
high-tech equipment to hospitals to get named to his $44,898-a-year post on the 
Medical Assistance Commission. The panel contracts with health care providers 
to deliver services to low-income and elderly people in the Medi-Cal program. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward said he met the governor 12 years ago when he moved onto Deukmejian's 
block. Deukmejian's three children at various times have been baby-sitters for 
the Woodwards' children, Woodward said. "We're neighbors. You say 'hi' to them. 
Once in a while invite him over to chat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Woodward said, he told the governor that he may have some 
time to serve on a state board, but did not seek a specific assignment. 
Woodward described his commission position as "just another job. I don't get 
any ego satisfaction out of it. I'm just a quiet person who is doing a job." 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Al Taucher, a member of the Fish and Game Commission, have 
known Deukmejian for 30 years. Taucher said he unsuccessfully sought a seat on 
the commission from then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. Taucher, who owned a Long Beach 
sporting goods store, said his neighborhood might have more people who have 
Deukmejian's ear, but dismissed suggestions that appointees exercise political 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
However, Charles G. Bell, author of a textbook on state government, said he 
believes gubernatorial appointees can wield influence either with the governor 
or in setting public policy. "The appointee may very well be at a reception at 
the governor's home or some social function that gives them a point of access 
that other kinds of individuals don't have," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said, "the general consensus is that 
Long Beach wasn't helped that much" by the appointments. The one exception, he 
asserted, is Bryan W. Littlefield, who manages an area beer distributorship and 
has used a seat on the Arts Council to promote local arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
Former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian, a one-time Deukmejian 
aide who now serves on the Council on Criminal Justice and the Board of 
Corrections, dismissed suggestions that appointees have special access to 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor listens to a lot of people, but he makes up his own mind. There's 
no such thing as clout or having the governor's ear," maintained Philibosian, 
who lives in Tarzana in the ZIP code 91356 -- with seven appointments 
representing the most of any San Fernando Valley ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has named a large number of fellow Armenian-Americans, including 
Philibosian, to state boards and commissions. Marvin Baxter, an Armenian who 
served as Deukmejian's former appointments secretary, said the governor credits 
the Armenian community with providing "the support he needed to be a viable 
candidate," especially in the 1982 Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
Richard R. Terzian of Westwood, who sits on the Commission on California State 
Government Organization and Economy, said: "All governors wind up giving 
appointments to people who are early and faithful supporters." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Terzian supported Deukmejian and helped raise money for his 1978 
attorney general's campaign, he did not immediately win an appointment. He 
sought one in 1983 or 1984, but it was several years later before he was named 
to the commission, better-known as the Little Hoover Commission. "What I did 
was I asked people I knew . . . who also knew the governor and who supported 
the governor and other people prominent in the community to write letters" on 
his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Some Deukmejian appointees have become engulfed in controversy even after 
winning spots on state panels. For instance, earlier this month Marianthi 
Lansdale, wife of Long Beach developer William M. Lansdale, apologized after it 
was reported that she had misstated her academic credentials when she told the 
governor's office that she had received an associate of arts degree from Long 
Beach City College in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Seats on high-profile and full-time boards usually require Senate confirmation. 
Sometimes the confirmation hearings spark disputes that result in an 
appointment being blocked. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in early 1988 the Senate Rules Committee rejected the 
reappointment of Angie L. Papadakis of Rancho Palos Verdes to a second term on 
the State Board of Education. She was criticized by lawmakers for opposing 
bilingual education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Papadakis said that after her rejection she was reluctant to take another state 
post, explaining, "I wanted to go on a cruise. I didn't want to be tied down to 
another responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, later in 1988 Deukmejian named her to the California-Nevada 
Superspeed Ground Transportation Commission, which is seeking to attract a 
private company to build a 300-m.p.h. train between Las Vegas and Anaheim. 
Senate confirmation was not required. 
</P>
<P>
When a Deukmejian aide queried her about her interest in the commission, 
Papadakis recalled telling him she didn't know anything about trains. She said 
the staffer asked: "Do you drive a car? Have you ever been stuck on a freeway? 
. . . Then you qualify." Papadakis said she has never received a call from 
Deukmejian telling her how to vote. "Once he appoints us, he gives us our 
head," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Deukmejian appointees concede that others might have more expertise to sit 
on a board or commission. "There are hundreds and hundreds . . . who are 
probably more qualified than I am," declared Tirso del Junco of Pasadena, a 
Deukmejian appointee to the University of California Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
Del Junco said that after Deukmejian was elected governor he received a letter 
asking if he was interested in a state appointment. Del Junco speculated that 
his political ties -- he is a former State Republican Party chairman -- and the 
Administration's desire to name a physician to the Regents prompted his 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Del Junco minimized the importance of his address in landing an appointment. 
So, too, did George Fenimore, a Deukmejian appointee to the Fair Political 
Practices Commission, who lives in Brentwood on the Westside. "I could have 
lived in Tarzana or Watts. It's just a coincidence," he said.

BAN ON HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT IS EXTENDED BY LA CANADA COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
MORATORIUM: THE CITY EXEMPTS PROJECTS ALREADY IN THE REVIEW PROCESS. IT ALSO 
APPROVES A CASE-BY-CASE REVIEW FOR FUTURE APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The La Canada Flintridge City Council voted 4 to 0 Tuesday night to extend an 
emergency moratorium on hillside development through early December. 
</P>
<P>
But responding to citizen complaints, the council added an exemption clause for 
projects already in the municipal approval process and a case-by-case review 
process for future applications. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ed Phelps abstained due to possible conflict of interest because his 
former law firm represents a La Canada Flintridge hillside developer. 
</P>
<P>
The exemption clause covers projects that have already been submitted to the 
city Planning Department for approval and pass through the building permit 
process within 120 days of the application's filing, City Attorney Stephanie 
Scher said. 
</P>
<P>
"The moratorium gives us some breathing space to develop new standards for 
hillside development, and the exceptions would allow projects that have been in 
the process to go forward within that breathing space," said Craig Ewing, 
senior planner. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing estimated that 30 properties in La Canada Flintridge are in the midst of 
the approval process and could be exempted from the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council adopted the 120-day provision and case-by-case review process 
after 18 residents spoke in opposition to the hillside moratorium at Tuesday 
night's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't want to invest thousands of dollars to build a house on a 
hillside only to be told later on that they've bought a picnic site," said Kent 
Jamison, a La Canada Flintridge developer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm all for a more restrictive ordinance, because it forces the developer to 
be more sensitive to the site," he added. "But on the other hand there needs to 
be a protection for individuals or companies who go to the city and ask what 
they need to do under the current ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
The city staff is formulating the appeal and case-by-case review processes. 
Property owners who request such a review would have to present their case to 
the Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The emergency moratorium on hillside development was enacted Dec. 4, 1988, when 
the city staff requested a 45-day review period to study the city's 1979 
hillside ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some problems with the existing hillside ordinance that people had 
taken advantage of . . . with very high retaining walls and excessive grading," 
said La Canada Flintridge architect Jay Johnson. "But it wasn't the correct 
procedure to just stop everything at once . . . I think the solution they've 
come up with is a good one." 
</P>
<P>
Ewing added, "People were building very precipitous buildings with high 
retaining walls, and the character of these buildings was not considered 
appropriate for La Canada." 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions raised about retaining walls, the council also adopted 
a provision that would require landscaping for the structures to reduce "the 
visual impact to the surrounding community," Mayor Pro Tem Chris Valente said.

BUSINESSES DIVIDE TO CONQUER HIGH RENTS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVE: AS THE FLOW TO GLENDALE'S HIGH-RISE DISTRICT CONTINUES, "BACK-SHOP" 
WORKERS ARE BEING SPLIT OFF INTO CHEAPER QUARTERS ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Even as office space continues to multiply on North Brand Boulevard and Central 
Avenue, major Glendale employers already are looking for ways to move their 
huddled masses to less expensive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus mirrors an emerging phenomenon in which more prestigious companies 
are moving to Glendale's high-rise corridor as its reputation becomes more 
upscale. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Federal Bank, which has its headquarters at 600 N. Brand, set the lead 
18 months ago. Almost half of the bank's 800 employees -- the "back-shop 
workers" who handle the computer data processing and administrative services of 
the operation -- moved to a handsome but simple building in an industrial 
section just outside of town, away from the public eye and the heavy transit 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
That has left more room in the bank's downtown headquarters to corporate 
executives whose power is often evidenced by the amount of space they command. 
</P>
<P>
Other major employers may follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and development experts predict that as land values and the cost 
of office space rises in the downtown area, the mushrooming populace of back 
office workers will gradually be replaced by front office executives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just barely happening, but it will get stronger," said the city's 
redevelopment consultant, Frank L. Fuller of ELS Design Group, at a recent 
meeting with the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
He cited the Carnation Co., which will move its 40-year-old headquarters from 
the mid-Wilshire district to 800 N. Brand Blvd. this year, as an example. 
"We're going to see more headquarters-type people moving to Glendale," Fuller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the typical office space of 250 square feet per employee, companies 
will start allocating 500 to 600 square feet of space for their higher-ranked 
executives. The prestige of a Brand Boulevard address warrants the increased 
cost, Fuller and other experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
Rental rates in the downtown area have jumped to about $25 per square foot, up 
from about $18 a square foot just five years ago, said Tony Maniscalchi, vice 
president of The Prudential Stevenson Real Estate, a specialist in commercial 
and industrial properties. In contrast, office space for back-shop workers can 
be obtained in industrialized zones for 30% to 35% less, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Braden, executive vice president of Fidelity Federal, said the decision 
to move back-office operations to an industrial zone was made almost three 
years ago to consolidate operations that were scattered at six smaller 
locations around Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
The bank bought a former manufacturing plant adjacent to the Golden State 
Freeway, conveniently located at the Edenhurst Avenue on- and off-ramps to the 
Colorado Street freeway extension. The remodeled two-story complex -- with its 
sprawling grounds, rolling lawns, picnic areas and even a basketball court -- 
is a welcome haven for workers away from the bustle of downtown, Braden said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to saving costs, Braden said, the operation in the high-security 
building is more efficient by having employees clustered on only two floors, 
rather than spread out over several floors of a high rise. "Paper flow works 
better across rather than up and down in elevators," Braden said. 
</P>
<P>
Fidelity is not alone. Security Pacific National Bank, which employes about 
1,800 workers at its technical services center at 611 N. Brand, "has no plans 
to relocate," said Deborah K. Lewis, senior vice president of corporate 
communications. However, a portion of the employees in the credit card 
processing unit in Glendale will be moved early this year to Arizona, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The subtle changes in the use of office space could have a dramatic effect on 
the future of Glendale's redevelopment zone, city officials and their advisers 
say. For instance, employing fewer workers in higher-profile jobs in the 
downtown area could reduce the amount of parking spaces needed in high-rise 
office buildings and, consequently, the amount of traffic on the most heavily 
traveled corridors, said Jeanne Armstrong, redevelopment director. 
</P>
<P>
While the city in the past has required developers to provide sufficient 
parking space to accommodate a maximum number of employees, officials now are 
considering limiting the amount of parking permitted in new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The policy could trigger greater use of buildings for executive offices or 
force employers to provide employee parking elsewhere, coupled with shuttle 
service to and from work, just as the Glendale Galleria transports workers, who 
must park at the Los Angeles Zoo during the busy holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
The shift toward more executives in downtown buildings is accompanied by the 
city's effort to lure more upscale tenants to downtown. Twentieth Century 
Insurance, for instance, leases a full floor in the 550 N. Brand building where 
it operates a regional claims adjustment office. The site was chosen because 
"it is convenient and easily accessible to a large concentration of customers," 
said Ric Hill, vice president of corporate relations. 
</P>
<P>
The Universal City law firm of Knapp, Petersen &amp; Clarke this year will move 
its cadre of 75 attorneys, backed by a 125-member support staff, to the 500 N. 
Brand building. Law firms typically demand greater floor space -- in this case, 
58,000 square feet -- than other office users, according to the Glendale 
Development Council, a public-private group promoting the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
Richard L. Botti of Keyser Marston Associates, the city's real estate and 
development consultant, recently told officials that North Brand "is more 
attractive today than it was five years and 10 years ago" to high-end tenants 
who are now moving to town because "they have seen that the value and character 
along Brand Boulevard is going to be maintained."

DANCE TEAM ON A ROLL; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE MIDNIGHT SUN ROLLER-SKATE DANCERS DAZZLE THE CROWDS AT 
VENICE BEACH -- AND WILL APPEAR SOON AT THE DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION. 
</P>

<P>
The afternoon sun that warmed Venice Beach on Sunday may have drawn thousands 
of visitors, but it was the cool Midnight Sun that dazzled them once they got 
there. 
</P>
<P>
And in March, this group of five roller-skate dancers will strap on their 
skates, smear rosin on their palms and don their black costumes to perform at 
the 43rd Los Angeles International Folk Dance Festival. 
</P>
<P>
From the rambunctious boardwalks of Venice to the staid stage of the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion may seem like quite a leap, particularly considering that the 
group has been together only since September, but the skaters appear confident 
that their sudden recognition is not simply a matter of fairy-tale luck. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to get a new art form off the ground. But since we have 
come together, we have soared like a rocket, combining all different styles 
into a unique routine," said Kristina Hill, who along with her husband, Chris 
Hill, formed the Midnight Sun. 
</P>
<P>
The routine is a visual salad: lifts, hops and spins covering the entire 
spectrum of dance forms, from the more traditional and fluid jazz, ballet and 
tap to the fast, upbeat and anything-goes moves of funk and disco. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers move mostly in couples, against the fast, staccato rhythm of a rap 
number. They execute daredevil acrobatic spins and twists in the air, and all 
kinds of break-dance moves. 
</P>
<P>
And the crowd eats it up. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd experiences a strong personal chemistry with the wheels, the acting, 
the expression, the dancing and the music. It is an unrefined art form that's 
growing," says Chris Hill, a ballet dancer and actor who has been dancing on 
wheels for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
The onlookers who surrounded them on the boardwalk on New Year's Eve afternoon 
were an eclectic mixture too: tourists squinting through camcorders, teen-agers 
joining in the dance, and a 5-year-old who came up to a dancer during a short 
break and urged him to "start with your stuff again!" 
</P>
<P>
"It stirs the child in everybody," said Kristina Hill. "It's fun to watch 
because when you dance on skates you can see the music. You roll from one 
movement to the other." 
</P>
<P>
Easy as it may sound, the movements clearly call for the agility and strength 
of a gymnast combined with the grace of a ballet dancer. 
</P>
<P>
"We work very hard; we practice regularly; we watch our routines on tape; we do 
the moves over and over," said Demeryst Upshaw, 24. 
</P>
<P>
All five dancers have extensive backgrounds in music and in "dancing on feet," 
as they call it. 
</P>
<P>
"Apart from jazz dancing, I played the drums, and that's where I get my rhythm 
from," Upshaw said. "I just conformed my drumbeats to my skates -- I put my 
hands to my feet." 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw and another Midnight Sun member, Laura von Bergman, recently returned 
from a skating tour of Japan that included performances in Nagoya and Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
Bergman, an Austrian who came to the United States three years ago, trained as 
a ballet dancer and also has been a competitive windsurfer. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything that has got to do with balance, I pick up very fast," she said. 
"The ballet and the windsurfing help a lot in lifts and spins in the air." 
</P>
<P>
A key break for the Midnight Sun dancers came a few months ago in the form of a 
chance encounter with tap dancer Chester Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
Whitmore, who choreographed the Grammy Award-winning comedy video, "I'm Fat," 
has toured Europe five times with his group, the Black Ballet Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
He met the Sun at a studio where "I was rehearsing in another room and happened 
to see them dance. They saw my group and wanted me to help them out with the 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed by their moves and told them that it was a good time for them 
to get an act." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Whitmore added, "they had to be seen by the right people." So he 
recommended the group to Irwin Parnes, managing director of the International 
Concerts Exchange, the agency that has been producing the Los Angeles 
International Folk Dance festival for the last four decades. 
</P>
<P>
Parnes, producer and the director of this year's festival, said he, too, was 
immediately impressed with their demonstration videotape. 
</P>
<P>
"To do the dances on roller skates was something unique," he said. "Their 
precision and their performance would be exciting." 
</P>
<P>
And so, even though "the roster was complete," the Midnight Sun was selected to 
perform at the festival, joining dancers from 16 countries, including Poland, 
Hungary and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to make it a spectacular thing because it is a great break," said 
Daniela Aguilar, 23, the fifth member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
The members admit that it is often difficult to balance their part-time jobs 
for sustenance and full-time dedication to roller-skate dancing. Money gets 
tight at times. 
</P>
<P>
There are sponsors, Kristina Hill says, including Reidell, a boot manufacturing 
company that has supplied them with shoes, and Powell Corp., which provides 
wheels and bearings. These help, Hill says, but the group still is trying to 
get the support necessary to obtain a studio where they can rehearse full time. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the mood of the skaters is buoyant. 
</P>
<P>
"We are taking off, and we are very optimistic," Chris Hill said. "We know that 
we are a very productive unit with fantastic versatility. We have members who 
are skilled in voice, mixing music, acting, choreographing, skating and 
dancing. And with support, we can really promote roller-skating as an art 
form," he said, then broke into a gentle trot followed by a furious spin on his 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
As a 44-year-old tourist from Spain said: "It's terrific. It feels as if they 
don't have feet. Instead, God gave them wheels."

CITY COUNCIL MAY CURB CATERING TRUCKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After working 20 years as a cook at a Sunset Boulevard restaurant, Juan Saenz 
opened a place of his own four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
He calls it La Jerezana, after his hometown in Mexico. His wife, Maria, works 
the grill, and his son, Humberto Pichardo, helps with customers. The tacos, 
they say, are out of this world. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nice to have my own business," Saenz said last month, his unshaven face 
flashing a proud smile. "We are making an honest living." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone is pleased with Saenz's new-found entrepreneurship. La 
Jerezana is a restaurant on wheels, a 22-foot-long modified Chevrolet Step Van 
that dishes up breakfast and lunch to gardeners, swimming pool cleaners, 
painters and repairmen in affluent Brentwood neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents in those neighborhoods don't think much of the fast-food road 
shows. Along Kenter Avenue, where Saenz and other caterers set up shop every 
day, homeowners want them out. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't even get out of my driveway," said Nancy Real, a resident on Kenter, 
which is often cluttered with pick-up trucks and vans as workers pull over for 
a bite to eat. "I have a little boy I take to school, and twice we have almost 
been hit by cars." 
</P>
<P>
Complaints from Brentwood residents, coupled with other gripes about trucks in 
Cypress Park and Wilmington, have led to new calls at Los Angeles City Hall for 
stiffer regulations on the rolling restaurants, which have become a roadside 
institution in many parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council is expected to consider a proposed ordinance this 
month that would limit stops by catering trucks to half an hour. Other 
proposals being considered by the council would ban the trucks from residential 
streets and sharply increase fines for violations. 
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of this is to allow the industry to continue but to regulate it in 
a meaningful way," said Councilman Marvin Braude, who proposed the half-hour 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Nate Holden, who heads the council's transportation committee, said 
the trucks have assumed a role far larger than city officials envisioned when 
they last imposed regulations more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They were intended to go visit construction sites," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
But drivers of catering trucks say times have changed. Southern Californians 
value convenience, they say, and that extends beyond the construction and 
factory workers looking for a cold soda during a break. As a result, the area 
has grown into the catering truck capital of the country, with 5,000 trucks 
licensed in Los Angeles County alone. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the drivers say they would be forced out of business if the city 
imposed new restrictions on their hours because they depend on one stop for 
their livelihood. La Jerezana, as an example, typically spends five to six 
hours a day at the same spot on Kenter. "I don't think we could survive too 
good," Pichardo said of the proposed restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
In Wilmington, Sabado Ramirez expressed similar gloom. Ramirez began operating 
his own truck this month on Blinn Avenue after working 10 years on his uncle's 
catering truck in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to go to factories looking for people who want lunch," said 
Ramirez, a native of Mexico City. "But that is real hard. There are a lot of 
catering trucks." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, about 50 trucks circled Los Angeles City Hall and several dozen 
drivers and family members marched on the sidewalk outside the Spring Street 
entrance to protest the proposed restrictions. The picketers said they belong 
to the Independent Catering Truck Owners Assn., a month-old group of 300 
drivers who do not work for large catering companies. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Sosa, a driver from East Los Angeles and president of the group, said the 
large catering companies control most traditional routes at factories and 
office buildings, forcing independent drivers to look for business on the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to stay five or six hours at one location to make a living," Sosa 
said. "Some of us park near hospitals where there are different break times. 
You can't just park there for a half hour and move on. You would miss most of 
your customers." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Ramirez, executive director of Industrial Caterers Assn., said his 
organization is also concerned about the proposed restrictions and will attempt 
to work with the city over the next month to soften them. The group, which 
represents large catering companies, accounts for about half of the catering 
trucks licensed by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the Los Angeles Police Department has a lot better things to do than 
go around and bother caterers who are trying to feed people," said Kelly 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
One driver in Wilmington said he feared the new regulations are racially 
motivated, a charge city officials deny. "A lot of people don't like Hispanic 
people," said Pablo Vargas, who has parked his truck for two years on Blinn. 
"They don't like us working here." 
</P>
<P>
The protesters outside City Hall on Wednesday -- almost all of whom were Latino 
-- also said the new restrictions would be discriminatory. Several carried 
placards proclaiming, "Do Not Violate our Civil Rights" and "Discrimination 
Against Hispanics." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to better ourselves," Sosa said. "But it seems they want to keep us 
down." About 90% of those in the catering truck industry in Los Angeles are 
Latino, according to the Industrial Caterers Assn. The group estimates that the 
industry employs 8,000 Latinos, most of whom frequent construction sites and 
factories. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Gloria Molina said at a recent council meeting that it is 
important the city craft a "balanced law" that does not hurt operators who are 
not causing problems. "Let's get those that have been abusing a privilege 
they've had for a long time," Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
Catering trucks in the city of Los Angeles already fall under a series of 
regulations, including requirements that they not park within 100 feet of 
intersections or restaurant entrances, or within 200 feet of schools or freeway 
ramps. Sales are also restricted to the vehicle's curbside, and each truck is 
required to provide a trash can. 
</P>
<P>
The city attempted to impose tougher requirements in the 1970s, at one point 
limiting curbside sales to 10 minutes. But catering truck drivers successfully 
challenged the restrictions in court, and later, Mayor Tom Bradley vetoed an 
ordinance that he said was too restrictive. Bradley has not announced a 
position on the current proposals. 
</P>
<P>
This time, however, Braude said his office has carefully researched the issue 
in hopes of avoiding the pitfalls of the past. The 10-minute restriction was 
struck down in 1975 because it did not specify how far a truck must move after 
the period has elapsed. In his current proposal, Braude has suggested that the 
truck be required to move at least half a mile after a half-hour stop. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Morris, deputy city attorney, said the state Motor Vehicle Code 
authorizes the city to impose restrictions on catering trucks so long as they 
are based on public safety concerns. It will not be difficult to meet such a 
test with the proposed new regulations, he said, because many trucks pose 
potential hazards for pedestrians and motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"This is particularly true around peak times, such as breaks or lunch," Morris 
said. "You have a lot of people for whatever reason (who) are pressed for time, 
and they need to move. . . . An individual could be forced, perhaps due to the 
density of the crowd, to traverse the roadway. Any time you have that kind of 
situation, you have potential for hazard to people." 
</P>
<P>
Other cities in the Los Angeles area already impose tough restrictions on 
catering trucks, with Glendale's 4-year-old ordinance regarded as one of the 
most restrictive. Trucks in that city can park on public streets for just 10 
minutes unless they receive a special city permit. City Clerk Aileen Boyle said 
only five of the 100 catering trucks there have been given extensions, ranging 
from one hour to four hours. 
</P>
<P>
The Glendale law, like the proposed Los Angeles restrictions, does not deal 
directly with trucks that park on private property. Glendale and Los Angeles 
officials said other city ordinances, such as building and zoning codes, 
already restrict food sales on private property. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Los Angeles, problems with the trucks are as diverse as the 
communities they serve. In Cypress Park and other parts of northeast Los 
Angeles, residents don't worry about gardeners blocking their driveways. They 
say they are concerned about crime. 
</P>
<P>
Some trucks have become hazards in those areas because of the rowdy crowds they 
attract, city officials said. Shortly after 6 p.m., the trucks line up outside 
liquor stores and bars, often becoming a gathering place for "riffraff," as one 
city official said. Many trucks remain in one place for six to eight hours, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The trucks are a real nuisance to neighborhoods," said Molina, who had bottles 
tossed at her recently when she asked a driver on Figueroa Street near Avenue 
43 to move his truck. "In our neighborhood it creates public drinking. With the 
taco or whatever they are purchasing, they also have their beer they bought at 
the liquor store. We have to eliminate it." 
</P>
<P>
Some catering truck operators, however, complain that the city is going after 
the wrong guy. "We don't sell the alcohol," said Jose Luis Martinez, speaking 
from his truck outside the Figueroa Market in Cypress Park. 
</P>
<P>
Problems with catering trucks on L Street near Avalon Boulevard in Wilmington 
led to a city experiment several months ago that harbor-area Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores said has flopped. City officials posted "No Parking" signs along a 
stretch of L Street, eliminating the catering trucks but also wiping out 
valuable curbside parking for visitors at a nearby senior citizens center. 
</P>
<P>
Flores has proposed an alternate pilot program for Wilmington that would keep 
catering trucks off public streets by restricting them to construction and 
industrial sites. In addition, parking would be limited to one hour on streets 
where catering trucks have been a problem.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: DIAMOND BAR; 
</P>
<P>
1-YEAR CELEBRATION BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has decided to throw itself a party to celebrate its first year of 
incorporation. Officials are planning an all-day picnic April 21 at Carlton J. 
Peterson Park. 
</P>
<P>
The event, proposed by City Council members John Forbing and Gary Werner, will 
include a softball tournament, food bazaar, citizen recognition awards, 
children's games, races and relays and a tree-planting ceremony. The City 
Council on Tuesday night appointed a committee to plan the activities, but 
members said they expect the project to be a communitywide effort. 
</P>
<P>
Diamond Bar, which has 45,000 residents and encompasses 8,000 acres of rolling 
hills, is the 86th city to be incorporated in Los Angeles County. It is one of 
the fastest-growing communities in the San Gabriel Valley.

WATER BOARD SEATS DISPUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Goliath of water agencies, Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, faces a challenge from the Three Valleys Municipal Water District 
over who can serve on Metropolitan's board. 
</P>
<P>
For the last three years, Richard W. Hansen, Three Valleys general manager and 
chief engineer, had represented the district on the Metropolitan board because 
political fighting among board members meant that no board member could gain a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
But the Three Valleys board last month voted 4 to 3 to send one of its members, 
Paul E. Stiglich, to serve on the Metropolitan board. But to attain the 
majority vote, Stiglich had to vote for himself. State law governing 
Metropolitan's board prohibits this. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we won't get in a spitting match with Metropolitan," said Three 
Valleys President William H. Koch. But, he said, it is important for the water 
district, which represents much of the eastern San Gabriel Valley, to have an 
elected official on the 51-member Metropolitan board, which oversees much of 
the water supply for the region's six counties. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan spokesman Jay Malinowski said the Three Valleys board must send 
them its minutes naming Stiglich before the Metropolitan board can decide 
whether to seat him, possibly at its February meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to make a personal judgment whether (Stiglich) ought to be on 
the agency," Malinowski said. "But we will make a legal judgment. And if we 
determine that his credentials aren't in order, he won't be seated."

SEARCHING FOR ILLEGAL SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City officials on the lookout for illegal business signs are conducting a 
street-by-street review to track them down. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities estimate that as many as two out of every five signs in San Gabriel 
violate city standards. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a five-month review process, owners of businesses with offending 
signs are being notified and asked to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, the City Council revised its sign regulations in hopes of achieving 
greater uniformity and better aesthetics. Roof signs, pole signs and animated 
signs were outlawed. 
</P>
<P>
Code enforcement officer Anthony Estrada said an earlier survey of the city's 
1,821 signs found that more than 700 violated the law. Seventy signs had been 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the city is first trying a cooperative approach. "We're trying to 
work with people," he said. "We're not trying to lay down the heavy arm of the 
law." 
</P>
<P>
But, he warned, for owners who don't change illegal signs, "there will come a 
time, in a month or two, when we may declare some of these signs as public 
nuisances."

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;

<P>
FUTURE MOVIE LOCATION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, in a bid to lure Hollywood production companies to Monrovia's 
quiet streets, unanimously approved an ordinance Tuesday to cut filming fees by 
about two-thirds. The first day of shooting will now cost $150 instead of $468, 
and charges for each additional day are down from $234.50 to $75. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment was prompted by a request from the California Film Commission, 
which is trying to promote film production in the state. The commission was 
created after California lost $3 billion worth of movie production to other 
states in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In order to streamline the process of obtaining permits, the council also 
instructed city employees to switch to the film commission's application and 
insurance forms and imposed new deadlines for staff members to process the 
applications.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
HOMELESS SHELTER CONTINUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because of the delayed opening of its permanent homeless shelter, the West 
Hollywood City Council has voted to continue the funding of a temporary shelter 
in West Hollywood Park Auditorium for at least six more months. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted 3 to 0 to take $96,000 from the city's budget for the 
homeless and from unallocated reserves to keep the auditorium site open while 
earthquake safety improvements are made at the permanent shelter at 1033 La 
Brea Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The money in the budget for the homeless was to have been used for operations 
at the permanent shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The council last year allocated money for the temporary shelter only through 
December, anticipating that the La Brea building would be in operation at the 
beginning of 1990. However, city officials then discovered that the permanent 
shelter would need substantial improvements to bring it into compliance with 
state earthquake safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Paul Brotzman said Tuesday that the La Brea shelter is unlikely to 
open before the middle of this year.

STUDENT LAW OFFICE OPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA School of Law is opening a teaching law office where attorneys will 
supervise students working on actual cases for clients. 
</P>
<P>
Located in a newly completed wing of the law school, the campus law office is 
unusual in that it will choose cases primarily for their educational value, a 
UCLA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the cases will be small-scale ones that students can complete in a 
single semester. 
</P>
<P>
The school is now looking for a lawyer to head the office and assist in 
teaching other clinical or practical courses offered by the school. Additional 
attorneys will be added to the staff next year. 
</P>
<P>
The office will open on a limited basis this month and will be fully 
operational by the 1990-91 school year. The type of cases emphasized will vary 
from semester to semester, a spokesman said. Initially, all will be civil 
cases.

ANIMAL CONTROL AGREEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiators for the city and the Pomona Valley Humane Society are hammering out 
an agreement to settle their dispute over funding for animal control services. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal would allow the humane society to collect more money from user 
fees, thus reducing its subsidy from the city's budget. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Julio Fuentes said details are still being worked out, but 
he plans to submit the proposal to the council at its meeting Monday night. The 
council and the humane society have been at odds over the cost of animal 
control services, with the city refusing to pay a proposed increase of $66,000 
per year. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new proposal would cut the cost to the city through the increased 
user fees, Fuentes said he does not know whether the council will accept the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
William Harford, executive director of the humane society, said that his 
agency, which earlier had notified the city that it would terminate animal 
control services in Pomona on Dec. 31, has agreed to continue providing 
services while a new contract is negotiated.

<P>
HEALTH: FRED HOSILLOS' FITNESS PROGRAM STRESS FUN ON THE RUN.

<P>
As a health educator at the Vallejo Drive Adventist Church in Glendale, Fred 
Hosillos is in charge of several activities -- most of which are identifiable 
from the T-shirts he wears. 
</P>
<P>
Walking Clinic, Bicycle Clinic, Backpacking Clinic are emblazoned on the shirts 
Hosillos presents to members of the exercise groups he has founded since 
arriving in Glendale from the Philippines in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned programs are offshoots of the successful Adventist Marathon 
Clinic, which will begin its seventh year in March. 
</P>
<P>
Open to people of all ages and religions, the Marathon Clinic is designed to 
improve health and self-esteem, especially in those that have only run away 
from exercise before. 
</P>
<P>
"A fitness program does not have to be intimidating," Hosillos said. "You don't 
have to be a track star to accomplish athletic goals in life." 
</P>
<P>
Hosillos, 49, has helped turn hundreds of couch potatoes into avid exercisers 
since he began a running program in 1982 in his hometown of Iloilo City in the 
Philippines. Invited by the Southern California Conference of the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church to import his program to Glendale in 1984, Hosillos has since 
helped launch marathon clinics in the South Bay and the San Fernando and San 
Gabriel valleys. In March, the program will expand to Westchester to service 
West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Alumni include a 71-year old woman who completed a 15-kilometer race in 1984, 
but the majority of participants are between 20 and 50 years of age. Some join 
to lose weight or as a way to start exercising regularly. Others have been 
referred by doctors to help channel stress. 
</P>
<P>
The running program itself was originally developed by John O. Wagner -- a 
Honolulu cardiologist who devised it 16 years ago as a cardiac rehabilitation 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-week clinic, which costs $30, includes a once-a-week Sunday meeting at 
Glendale High or Verdugo Park, where a discussion of health-related topics 
precedes a group run. 
</P>
<P>
Each clinic is broken into beginner, intermediate and advanced groups. 
Beginners start by jogging 30 minutes three times a week at a 15-minute-a-mile 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
Participants must have medical clearance and, in some cases, undergo treadmill 
tests before they begin. But Hosillos says anyone who follows the program 
sensibly will be able to traverse nine miles by the end of the first four 
months. Participants who want to go longer distances stay on for 36 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than focusing on competition, Hosillos stresses the social aspects of 
exercise. If you can't hold a conversation while you're running, you're going 
too fast. The emphasis is on finishing, not winning. 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years, the group has concluded the program with a pilgrimage 
to Hawaii to participate in the Honolulu Marathon. Last month, 26 participants 
from the clinic walked, ran or did a combination of both to finish the 
26.2-mile course. 
</P>
<P>
"Calling it a marathon clinic is a misnomer and probably scares a lot of people 
away even though many people do, in fact, do the marathon," clinic participant 
Dan Engel of Glendale said. "The goal is to impact your life style and 
introduce a certain aspect of healthy activity into it." 
</P>
<P>
That's all Engel, 36, was looking to achieve when he joined in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I was definitely a couch potato-type person," he said. "I was somewhat 
overweight and definitely sedentary." 
</P>
<P>
When he began, Engel's goal was to finish a 10-kilometer race by the end of 12 
weeks. It took him just a month to achieve that, so he shot for a 
half-marathon. 
</P>
<P>
He conquered that distance in 12 weeks and decided to stay on for the marathon, 
which he also completed. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Engel has run five more marathons, including two in Los Angeles and 
another in Portland, Ore. He covered the course there in a personal-best four 
hours, eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easy program that does not compel a person to look at performance or 
put himself in with a bunch of jocks," Engel said of the Marathon Clinic. 
"You're just in with a bunch of sedentary folks like yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a certain camaraderie that exists in the group and it's the thing that 
made it very workable. There's no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Hosillos' plans for the clinic include a trip to the Singapore Marathon in 1991 
and to the Montreal Marathon in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 40% to 70% dropout rate -- typical, Hosillos said, of all exercise 
programs -- the Marathon Clinic continues to grow. Last year, Hosillos started 
a program in Seattle and he has been approached to do the same in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
However, the formula for success remains the same wherever runners venture. 
</P>
<P>
"If they stick with it and take our advice about what to eat and drink and how 
to space their program with periods of relaxation there is no doubt they will 
achieve their goal," Hosillos said. "We don't care whether they walk it or run 
it, they will attain their stated goal."

HOBBLED GLENDALE OPENS CONFERENCE PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Glendale College basketball team gets an early Western State Conference 
test when the Vaqueros play host to defending conference champion Santa Monica 
on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (12-6) opened WSC play Wednesday against West Los Angeles without 
starting forward Justin Lord, who sprained an ankle last weekend in the Palomar 
tournament. Results of the Glendale-West L.A. game were not available at press 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Lord, the Vaqueros' tallest starter at 6-foot-6, is also expected to miss the 
game against Santa Monica. He is averaging 13 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing really well when he (Lord) got hurt ," said Glendale Coach 
Brian Beauchemin, whose team had won seven consecutive games before losing to 
Mt. San Jacinto in the second round of the Palomar tournament. "I felt like we 
were just getting ready for conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we're kind of in quest of some back-line people until he gets 
better." 
</P>
<P>
The search got tougher earlier this week when Chris Cooke, a 6-8 freshman who 
often was the first player off the Glendale bench, injured his foot in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Glendale will meet a team that is 16-3 and coming off a win 
last weekend over top-ranked and previously unbeaten Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs, who went 15-0 in WSC play last season, are led by forwards 
Cornelius Banks and Mark Moten. Banks, a freshman, is averaging 15 points and 
eight rebounds. Moten, a sophomore, is averaging 15 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale competes in the WSC Southern Division, which includes Santa Monica, 
Valley, Canyons, West L. A. and Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, Oxnard, Santa Barbara, Moorpark and Cuesta compose the Northern 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Sharpshooter: Laura Oki, who helped lead Marshall High to the City Section 3-A 
Division girls' basketball championship last season, looks like she might have 
a good shot at repeating as 3-A Player of the Year if she continues at her 
current pace. 
</P>
<P>
Oki, a senior guard, is averaging 22 points a game for Marshall (8-2) and 
scored a season-high 36 points last weekend in a 63-62 loss to Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just burnin'," Marshall Coach Wendy Triplett said. "She's hitting the 
three-pointers like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Oki had eight three-point baskets against Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
For openers: Glendale-area boys' basketball teams begin Pacific League play 
Friday with Hoover playing host to Crescenta Valley and Glendale visiting Muir. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena and Muir are, once again, considered the teams to beat in the Pacific 
League. Crescenta Valley, Arcadia and Glendale are expected to contend for 
playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
Crescenta Valley (8-4) is coming off a disappointing showing in last week's 
Hart tournament. The Falcons beat Glendale and lost to East Bakersfield and 
Canyon. It was the first time in three years -- and six tournaments -- that 
Crescenta Valley had failed to make the final. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can snap this," said Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo, whose 
team began the season 7-2. "We're playing really poorly right now." 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (6-7), also struggling, will meet Muir and Pasadena in its first two 
league games without the services of forward Scott Tillman, sidelined because 
of a broken thumb. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough vacation for us," Glendale Coach Bob Davidson said. "We haven't 
played real well. But I think if we can start shooting like we're capable, 
we'll be in the running for a playoff spot." 
</P>
<P>
Onward and upward: Three Glendale College football players have committed to 
four-year schools and will transfer at the semester break in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Sean Hampton will attend Utah State. Hampton rushed for 760 yards 
and seven touchdowns last season and also caught 11 passes for 147 yards and 
two touchdowns. In 1988, Hampton gained 1,150 yards and scored 13 touchdowns 
and was an All-Western State Conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Pat Lynch, who had 39 receptions for 581 yards and five 
touchdowns this season, will attend San Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
Mark MacMillan, an all-state defensive back for the Vaqueros in 1988, chose 
Alabama over USC. 
</P>
<P>
Bowled over: The Glendale College football program was well-represented in bowl 
games during the holidays as five former Vaqueros participated. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schultz, a former All-American offensive lineman at Glendale, started for 
USC in the Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Greenfield was the punter for Pittsburgh in the Panthers' John Hancock 
Bowl victory, Sal Velasco was the kicker for Hawaii in a loss in the Aloha 
Bowl, defensive lineman Dave Ewing played for Fresno State in a California Bowl 
win, and defensive end Antoine Mitchell of Oregon participated in the 
Independence Bowl.

HEART OF THE PROBLEM; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 'I WAS REALLY SCARED,' SAID GLENDALE COLLEGE'S GARY FOWLER 
WHEN THE DOCTOR THOUGHT HE FOUND AN IRREGULAR HEART BEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
The physical proceeded just like so many others the athlete had faced. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Fowler of Glendale College sailed through the weigh-in, height 
measurement, eye-and-ear check and other staples of the examination, a 
preseason ritual for all participants in high school and intercollegiate 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
But when the doctor pressed his stethoscope to Fowler's chest and back, things 
became a little more complex. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler's heartbeat sounded irregular, the doctor said, and he suggested that 
Fowler's personal physician perform further tests before the athlete resumed 
basketball practice. 
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis and weeklong battery of examinations that followed made the 
19-year-old Fowler's heart race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared," Fowler recalled. "I didn't do any physical activity. I wasn't 
participating in anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I even jumped too fast to turn the channel on the TV." 
</P>
<P>
When the tests -- including a strenuous bout on a treadmill -- were completed, 
Fowler was declared fit to play. And since returning to the Vaquero lineup, the 
6-foot-5 sophomore hasn't missed a beat. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler is averaging 15 points and eight rebounds for a veteran Glendale team 
that is 12-6 and opening play in the Western State Conference this week. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, a co-captain and returning All-Western State Conference forward from 
Muir High in Pasadena, is the Vaqueros' best defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
"Without him," said Brian Beauchemin, the Glendale coach, "we're missing a 
physical presence." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, Fowler is probably the Vaqueros' only physical presence. At 6-6, 
Justin Lord is the team's tallest starter. Fowler, however, patrols the area 
around the basket for the Vaqueros and usually draws the opposition's best 
front-court player, regardless of the size mismatch. 
</P>
<P>
During Glendale's championship performance in its own tournament three weeks 
ago, Fowler was selected to the all-tournament team mostly for the way he 
handled 6-6 forward Terry Nelson of Harbor in the semifinals and 6-10 center 
Eric Pauley and 6-9 forward Andre Lamoureaux of Cypress in the championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been games where Gary is absolutely beat up," Beauchemin said. "But 
his expression never changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Other guys get excited by errant elbows and the kinds of things that happen 
under the basket where you're playing against guys who play like offensive 
lineman." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler contends that there is no reason to lose control. His philosophy is 
simple: Why get mad when you know you're going to get even? 
</P>
<P>
"If someone does something really dirty, I'll always get him back during the 
course of the game," Fowler said. "I tell him. I'll whisper in his ear. Simple 
as that. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to punch them or anything. But just let them know to watch for 
it because it's coming." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler came to Glendale last season after playing only one season of varsity 
basketball at Muir, where he averaged 16 points a game his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
He enrolled at Glendale and got an immediate break when several of the 
Vaqueros' returning players left the team to get jobs or enlist in the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
Like fellow freshmen Bruce Heicke, David Swanson, Vigen Serop and Lord, Fowler 
took full advantage of the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 14.1 points and a team-high 7.7 rebounds a game for a Glendale team 
that finished 20-12 overall and 10-5 in the WSC. The Vaqueros advanced to the 
state playoffs, defeating Golden West in the first round before falling to El 
Camino. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler credits Beauchemin for helping him make a successful jump to the junior 
college level. 
</P>
<P>
"Most athletes are intimidated to talk to their coaches, but you can't be with 
Brian," Fowler said. "He's easy to talk to. You can go into his office and just 
have a rap session." 
</P>
<P>
If there was a rap against Fowler coming into this season, it was that his 
outside shot needed work. Despite averaging in double figures, it was not 
uncommon to see Fowler clank a frozen rope off the rim from beyond 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, I shot a lot from the outside, but when I got here I kind of 
lost my confidence from that range," Fowler said. "Everything was 'inside, 
inside.' 
</P>
<P>
"I worked on it over the summer and now I'm just starting to feel comfortable 
again." 
</P>
<P>
That's bad news for WSC opponents who will try to keep Fowler and his teammates 
from a shot at the conference championship -- something the Vaqueros have not 
won since 1985.

DEPOT SOLD FOR TRANSPORT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Glendale has purchased the historic Southern Pacific Railroad Depot 
for $3.3 million and plans to turn it into a regional transit center. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the 66-year-old, colonial-Spanish-style building and the 
2.4-acre site at 400 W. Cerritos Ave. from Southern Pacific Railroad was 
finalized Dec. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the purchase came from the city's share of Proposition A transit 
taxes, which amounted to more than $3.5 million. The balance of the funds will 
be used for administrative costs and to hire a consultant to study how to 
preserve the depot while developing the site as a commuter hub, said Steve 
Adams, project director and assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
The city proposes to spend an additional $3.5 million to build a multilevel 
parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
The Amtrak commuter train will continue operating out of the station on a 
long-term lease, he said.

SYMPHONY AND PHILHARMONIC FANS CELEBRATE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Into the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
That's what they called their party that began Sunday night -- at the end of 
the '80s. And they arrived -- into the '90s -- with Strauss waltzes and show 
tunes, fancy food and camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint New Year's Eve party, the Pacific Symphony and the Orange County 
Philharmonic Society invited friends and supporters to a black-tie bash at the 
Westin South Coast Plaza. More than 430 guests paid $150 each to attend the 
champagne reception, concert and dinner-dance in the hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
Symphony executive director Louis Spisto said his organization decided to split 
its annual New Year's party with the Philharmonic Society because "we're both 
in the business of developing classical music for the community. It just made 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
It also allowed the groups to boost the ticket price, thin the crowd and offer 
a classier classical eve. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving at 7 p.m., guests nabbed complimentary champagne and chatted outside 
the ballroom decorated with boldly colored balloon clusters. "Whoa," said 
Spisto, when he got his first peek of the red, green, purple and gold decor. 
"Not exactly the Symphony Ball, is it?" 
</P>
<P>
Party co-chairwoman Lorraine Lippold worked the check-in desk and greeted 
friends with New Year's hugs. Privately, she offered her comments on the coming 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Well I'm not one for making resolutions," said Lippold, who sat at dinner with 
Spisto, symphony guest conductor Toshiyuki Shimada and his wife, Eva. "I just 
wait and see what happens, and I try to enjoy it -- whatever it is." 
</P>
<P>
Not so Susan Beechner, who co-chaired the festivities with Lippold. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year I resolve to go on a diet and exercise daily," said Beechner. She 
said her annual resolution was particularly apt this year "because my daughter 
gave me 800 pounds of fudge for Christmas and I am single-handedly working my 
way through it." 
</P>
<P>
Symphony President Randy Johnson and his date, Carole McMahan, said they wished 
for no less than "peace throughout the world" in the decade ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hoping for that for all of my 52 years," said Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what happens," he said, with a Californian's addendum, "the tide 
comes in and the tide goes out." 
</P>
<P>
On the world peace theme -- a popular wish among the party-goers -- 
Philharmonic Society chairwoman Nancy Posch said she and her husband, Frank, 
plan to travel the Danube in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"That'll take us through about seven of the countries (in Eastern Europe) that 
are changing so much now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Grier, a Philharmonic Society board member and key planner of the Sunday 
night fest, said the political changes in Eastern Europe made her think of 
another time "like the Gay '90s that ended the last century." 
</P>
<P>
Also attending were Dean and Shirley Lane-Smith, Richard and Nancy Palicka, Bob 
and Gloria Stanton, Paul and Barbara Rutkowski and newlyweds Jerry and Petrina 
Friede. 
</P>
<P>
Party planner Cornelia Mazer shared the night with date Abdo Khoury and friends 
Mark and Christina Briggs. Eva Schneider, who also co-chaired the event, did 
not attend. 
</P>
<P>
When ballroom doors opened at 8 p.m., guests found their assigned seats at the 
dinner tables, which served as concert seats during the 45-minute symphony 
presentation of music by Strauss, Rodgers and Hammerstein, and Lerner and Lowe. 
Soprano Evelyn De La Rosa joined the symphony and, with conductor Shimada, made 
the midnight toast to the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
After the concert, dinner of pheasant, roast veal chop, asparagus and angel 
hair pasta was served, and dancing took the party-goers into the '90s.

HEALTH &amp; FITNESS: BURNT OUT ON AEROBICS 'BURN' PHILOSOPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OK, left foot forward. Energy! Come on, you can do it! Bring it back, four 
counts. If you're getting breathless, slow down. Now step-touch for eight! 
Almost done! Good. Let's march it out! 
</P>
<P>
Going for the burn may have gone out of style with Cabbage Patch Kids and video 
Ping-Pong, but if you think you can skip aerobics class now that the '80s are 
history, think again. Looks like plenty of us are going to be pulling on those 
leotards and leg warmers well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, '90s aerobics may be barely recognizable compared to those hardy 
pioneers who huffed and puffed a decade ago, say Richard and Susan Foley, 
husband-and-wife aerobics instructors (yes, they met on the aerobics floor) who 
live in El Toro. Founders of the Professional Fitness Instructors Assn. of 
Orange County, the Foleys signed up for their first aerobics classes back in 
the early '80s, when the field was in its formative stages. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then there was just one kind of class, just plain aerobics," says Susan, 
aerobics coordinator at the El Toro Physical Fitness Center. "Now you can 
choose from low-impact and high-impact, low-impact with weights, circuit 
training, body sculpting, pregnancy classes, classes for seniors -- there's a 
lot of variety." And each type of class has benefited from continuing research 
on the most efficient and safest ways to burn fat. 
</P>
<P>
"We've learned so much over the years," says Richard, a full-time structural 
engineer who also teaches three classes a week at Nautilus Plus Aerobics in 
Irvine. "In the early days, everybody did their own thing. There was no central 
focus. And a lot of what we were doing then was just plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Early aerobics instructors knew that the idea was to help participants increase 
their heart rates and keep them up for 20 minutes or more in order to burn body 
fat aerobically -- meaning "with oxygen." But many of them didn't understand 
that the actual burning sensation satirized in Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury comic 
strip back in 1982 ("Yes, but it's a good burn") meant just the opposite. That 
burning feeling, aerobics instructors now know, came from a buildup of lactic 
acid in muscles deprived of oxygen because they were being worked too hard and 
too fast. And without oxygen, fat doesn't burn. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, "aerobics used to be anaerobic," Richard says. 
</P>
<P>
"Back then, it was like, the harder, the better," he says. Except for the fact 
that most participants were women, "it seemed a lot like football practice," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"We really believed that stuff about no pain, no gain," adds Susan. 
</P>
<P>
For some students, the pain involved was far more than a burn. Some exercises, 
such as one called the plow, which involves supporting most of the body's 
weight with the neck and shoulders, were likely to cause injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, most aerobics workouts are much less punishing and, at the same 
time, more effective, the Foleys say. 
</P>
<P>
The changes have left some participants confused. 
</P>
<P>
"When you sign up for aerobics class, you can't be sure what kind of workout 
you'll get unless you know what to look for," Richard says. 
</P>
<P>
And because there is no standardized training or continuing education for 
instructors, a class leader may or may not be up on the latest research. 
</P>
<P>
The Foleys founded the nonprofit PFIA a year ago to address both those 
problems. Now with more than 100 members, the organization promotes public 
awareness about aerobics and serves as a forum for aerobics instructors. At a 
typical meeting, members may hear the latest medical information from a 
cardiologist or trade tips on choreography and music. The group also publishes 
a monthly newsletter and in February will hold its first awards banquet to 
honor outstanding instructors, coordinators and fitness facilities in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started teaching, the only requirements for an aerobics instructor 
were to look good in a leotard and have your own music," Susan says. 
Eventually, the Foleys say they would like to see some sort of minimum 
credentials required for all aerobics instructors. 
</P>
<P>
Music, by the way, has also changed dramatically over the years in aerobics. 
"It used to be, you'd just put on a record," Susan says. 
</P>
<P>
And when the record ended, Richard recalls, "we would just go down on the floor 
while the instructor found another record and put it on. We didn't know it 
wasn't good to just stop suddenly." 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, informed instructors carefully select music with a steady beat, 
starting off slow for warm-ups, faster -- but not too fast -- for the aerobic 
part of the workout and then even slower for the cool-down at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to have any speed bumps, and you want the moves to stay with 
the phasing of the music, so people can anticipate when the next change is 
coming," Susan says. 
</P>
<P>
If you're considering enrolling in aerobics, don't choose a class solely on the 
basis of schedule, location or even price. 
</P>
<P>
"The most expensive classes aren't necessarily the best," Richard says. "Most 
places will let you take a class first without signing up, and if you do that 
with several, you'll have a basis for comparison." 
</P>
<P>
And if you enjoy aerobics but don't like a particular class, don't give up. 
</P>
<P>
"People can get frustrated," Susan says. "You get a bad instructor, and you 
think there's something wrong with you. We don't want people to get turned off 
to aerobics because they may have (had) a bad experience."

ASK THE VET: FEEDING CAT RAW MEAT CAN CAUSE DIGESTIVE DISEASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DR. GLENN ERICSON, Ericson, a practicing Orange County veterinarian, is 
immediate past president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical Assn.

<TEXT>
<P>
Q One of my friends recently told me that I should be giving my cats some raw 
meats, such as liver, because she says that cats in the wild eat raw meat. I 
tried to give my cats uncooked liver, but one of them vomited it after eating. 
I have been told that these foods are an excellent supply of vitamins and 
minerals for my cats. What do you suggest? Is it harmful to my cats to give 
them uncooked meats? 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. R. Martini, 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A Raw or uncooked meats such as liver can cause toxoplasmosis, salmonellosis, 
parasitism of the intestines, vitamin and mineral excesses or imbalances, or 
other forms of digestive diseases or upsets. While it is true that cats in the 
wild do eat raw foods, their life expectancies and health are not as good as 
those of domestic cats. It would be better to feed your cats good-quality 
commercial cat food and occasionally give them some cooked foods as a treat. 
</P>
<P>
You should also avoid letting your cats catch and eat rodents or birds because 
these may also be a source of problems for your pets. 
</P>
<P>
Q My dog, a golden retriever, has developed an ear infection that causes a very 
bad odor and makes him scratch and whine. We have been cleaning his ears with a 
liquid medicine from the pet shop and that seems to help some but it doesn't 
clear it up. 
</P>
<P>
We took him to our vet, who cleaned the ears and sent him home with a lotion to 
put in the ears once a day. This helped for a while, but the problem has 
returned. What should we do now? Is it possible that his ear infection is 
contagious to us? He is really uncomfortable and gets very restless. 
</P>
<P>
P.T. Terrace, 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
A I would recommend that you have your dog rechecked by your veterinarian. Your 
pet may require sedation and a wash with an antibacterial solution to 
completely clean the ears of any infection or debris. Then the ears can be 
examined thoroughly for signs of ulcerations and to see if the eardrum is 
intact. It may also be necessary to check the material from the ears for signs 
of fungus or mites. 
</P>
<P>
Once the ears are throughly cleaned, medication can be applied. e Oral 
antibiotics may also be needed. Your veterinarian should show you the proper 
way to clean the ears at home. Weekly checkups may be needed to follow the 
progress of your treatment and allow for any necessary changes in medication. 
</P>
<P>
Chronic ear infections in dogs can become very serious and if left unchecked, 
could require surgery in an attempt to reconstruct a functional ear.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARENTS OF SLAIN MAN FILE WRONGFUL-DEATH SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A $5-million wrongful-death suit has been filed against Los Angeles County in 
the shooting of an unarmed Hawthorne man, who was mistaken by a sheriff's 
deputy as a suspect in the robbery of a Lennox-area liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Torrance Superior Court by relatives of Marcus Donel, 30, a 
law firm courier with no crimminal record, charged that Donel had done nothing 
suspicious when the deputy stopped him outside his home on May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Futhermore, the suit said, the liquor store owner reported that he had been 
robbed by a Latino about 18 years old, but when deputies broadcast a 
description of the suspect he was mistakely described as black. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted by deputies, investigators said Donel lay on the ground as ordered, 
but then he allegedly drew one arm close to his body, as if to draw a gun, and 
Deputy Patrick Maxwell fired, shooting Donel in the chest. The Sheriff's 
Department later concluded that Maxwell had acted properly in fear that he 
might be shot.

FAMILY OF MAN SLAIN BY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY SUES FOR $5 MILLION; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: UNARMED HAWTHORNE VICTIM WAS MISTAKEN FOR ROBBERY SUSPECT. 
SHERIFF'S INVESTIGATORS CONCLUDED DEPUTY WAS JUSTIFIED.

<P>
The family of an unarmed Hawthorne man, who was shot to death last year by a 
sheriff's deputy after he was mistaken for a robbery suspect, has filed a 
$5-million wrongful death lawsuit against the county. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Donel's mother, two sisters and two daughters charge in a lawsuit in 
Torrance Superior Court that deputies should not have stopped Donel, a black 
man, because a liquor store owner said the man who robbed him was Latino. The 
suit claims that Donel did nothing suspicious before he was shot outside his 
home last May 31 by Deputy Patrick Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators said that Donel was shot when he made "suspicious 
movements" after he was stopped by deputies who heard a broadcast that 
misidentified the robber as black, instead of Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began at 9:50 p.m., when the owner of Capri Liquor in the Lennox 
district called police to say that he had been robbed by a male "Mexican," 
about 18 years old. The description was broadcast to patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies then went to the store to "get a better description" of the suspect, 
according to tape recordings of radio transmissions that the Sheriff's 
Department released shortly after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies broadcast a second description of the suspect: "One male black, 17 
to 18, 5-6, 125, wearing all black and a black baseball cap." 
</P>
<P>
Deputies subsequently stopped Donel -- although 5-9, 160 pounds and 30 years 
old -- because he was also wearing black and substantially matched the 
description of the robber, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Donel partially cooperated with orders to lie down, but uttered a string of 
obscenities and then drew one arm close to his body, as if to reach for a gun, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell was concerned for his safety and fired one shot, which hit Donel in the 
chest. After the shooting, deputies found that Donel did not have a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's investigators concluded that Maxwell acted properly, believing he 
would be shot. Sheriff's officials could not be reached for comment Wednesday 
to say why the errant identification was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Donel's family criticized the department's investigation and picketed the 
Lennox Sheriff's Station in the month after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Donel's stepbrother, Terry Curd, was with him at the time and gave a different 
account of the shooting, according to the family's lawyers, who have asked Curd 
not to speak to the press. 
</P>
<P>
Donel was a courier for a law firm and had no criminal record, his family said. 
He supported a wife and two daughters, 10 and 11 years old, at the time of his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit calls deputies "incompetent and insensitive." It also charges 
deputies with defamation for identifying Donel as the man who robbed Capri 
Liquor.

TORRANCE TO CALL D.A. TO PROBE FUTURE POLICE SHOOTINGS, JAIL DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
The Torrance Police Department will call on the district attorney's office to 
investigate officer-involved shootings and deaths of prisoners in custody, a 
department official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Donald Nash is expected to order this month that Torrance 
investigators call the district attorney's "roll-out" teams in those 
situations, Capt. Jim Weyant said. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to ask for independent investigations follows a difficult year for 
the Torrance Police Department. Last February, two officers were charged with 
lying about the shooting of an unarmed man, and in September a jury ruled that 
the department has routinely condoned misconduct by officers. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the county's 47 police departments call the district attorney's 
office to investigate jail deaths and police shootings that result in injuries 
or deaths, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Herb Lapin. 
</P>
<P>
Torrance police officials have vehemently denied charges that they have not 
thoroughly investigated fellow officers. However, Weyant noted, participation 
in the district attorney's roll-out program will help eliminate even the 
appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
"Some changes can be made so that the perception is that we do things right," 
Weyant said. "It adds to the overall thoroughness. Anything we do, there is 
another entity doing it too." 
</P>
<P>
In the district attorney's program, a prosecutor and an investigator "roll out" 
to the scene of police shootings and jail deaths, Lapin said. They interview 
witnesses, review evidence and reach conclusions independently of police 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's investigations seldom find improprieties in the police 
department reviews, but they bolster public confidence, Lapin said. "It gives 
the police the position of being able to say, 'It is under investigation by the 
district attorney's office,' " Lapin said. 
</P>
<P>
Participation in the roll-out program is the most recent in a series of 
procedural changes in the Torrance Police Department after last year's 
problems. The department has already imposed a rule that ranking officers must 
investigate misconduct allegations. It has also begun to reorganize and 
simplify internal affairs files. And it will adopt a computer program that will 
allow administrators to track the most common kinds of police misbehavior and 
to standardize discipline. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the Torrance department conducted its own investigations when 
officers shot suspects, as it did in the May, 1988, shooting of Patrick J. 
Coyle. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Timothy Pappas initially said he shot Coyle when the Torrance 
construction worker reached for a shiny object in his belt, police reports say. 
Coyle was partially paralyzed as a result of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Two fellow officers backed Pappas' account, but one of them later said that the 
story was a lie and that the shooting was unprovoked. Armed with the new 
information, the Police Department fired Pappas and the two officers who backed 
his story. 
</P>
<P>
The department presented the case to the district attorney's office and Pappas 
and fellow officer Mark Holden were charged last February with conspiracy to 
obstruct justice and conspiracy to falsely charge another with a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Pappas pleaded no contest to lesser charges and last month was fined $2,250 and 
placed on one year of probation. Holden is scheduled to go to trial this spring 
on the original charges. The third officer, Timothy Thornton, was granted 
immunity in exchange for his testimony against the two. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, the Police Department lost a $5.5-million civil judgment to a 
San Pedro man whose son was killed in a traffic collision with an off-duty 
police sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found that fellow officers covered up Sgt. Rollo Green's responsibility 
for the crash as part of a pattern in which Torrance police have condoned 
misconduct by fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
The city has appealed the verdict, and Police Department officials say the 
department did nothing wrong.

OLD HARBOR AREA PIPELINES PROMPT L.A. TO ANTICIPATE BURIED TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The maps in Al Provost's office tell the story of an underground world. 
</P>
<P>
They show a subterranean network that most people never think about -- an 
intricate maze of pipelines that run under city streets, carrying millions of 
gallons of water, sewage, natural gas, crude oil and other potentially volatile 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Provost, a city engineer in the Los Angeles Harbor area, is responsible for 
knowing where these pipelines lead. But his maps, as extensive as they are, 
don't tell all. Every once in a while, a surprise pops up -- a mystery pipeline 
that seems to belong to nobody. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent street widening project in Wilmington, for example, a 
construction crew discovered a pipeline that appeared to contain pressurized 
crude oil. The line was not recorded on any city map. No oil company claimed 
ownership of it. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, baffled city officials turned to the Exxon Corp., which operates all 
the oil wells in the Wilmington area. Exxon tapped the abandoned line -- which 
actually contained only traces of crude oil and methane gas -- and then removed 
it as a favor to the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very lucky," Provost said, adding that it took city officials several 
weeks to resolve the problem, during which time no work could proceed on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
That incident prompted Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who 
represents the harbor area, to call for a review of problems that might be 
caused by unidentified pipelines throughout the city, and especially in the 
heavily industrialized Wilmington community. 
</P>
<P>
"The driving force behind this is that there's an infrastructure under the city 
that has not been identified," said Flores spokeswoman Karen Constine. "It's 
kind of like accidents waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
The Wilmington discovery was by no means the first time an uncharted pipeline 
has surfaced during a construction project, either in the harbor area or 
elsewhere in the city. According to Gene McPherson of the city Bureau of 
Engineering in downtown Los Angeles, uncharted pipelines are discovered five or 
six times a year in his district, which stretches from Fairfax Avenue to the 
city's eastern border and north from 110th Street to Mulholland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
In about 25% of those cases, McPherson said, the lines are in use. Sometimes, 
he said, it can take as long as three weeks for the city to figure out what to 
do with them. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to assume the worst every time you find one of these things," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, McPherson and other city officials have said that they are 
relatively certain that they have complete records of water, sewage and natural 
gas lines, as well as underground telephone conduits and cable company lines. 
They are less certain about oil pipelines, in part because some were laid 
before the city began keeping records in the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' motion, which is scheduled for a hearing Jan. 17 before the City 
Council's Public Works Committee, focuses mostly on the private pipelines that 
run under the city's streets, carrying crude oil and oil products, such as 
gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
The motion cites a disastrous accident on Venice Boulevard in 1976, in which an 
excavation machine struck an underground gas pipeline, starting a fire that 
killed nine people and injured 14. In that case, the National Transportation 
Safety Board ruled that Standard Oil of California had failed to supply the 
road-building contractor with the precise depth of the gasoline line, which was 
charted on government maps. 
</P>
<P>
Oil industry sources say such an accident involving an unidentified pipeline is 
highly unlikely. They say most uncharted pipes are old lines that are no longer 
in use and do not pose such a threat. They say they know of no instances where 
a serious accident has occurred because someone struck an active pipeline that 
was not identified on government maps. 
</P>
<P>
"Any kind of danger of breaking into them would be a minimal danger," said 
Exxon spokesman Brian Dunphy. "It's not like you have (unidentified) 
pressurized lines down there that are under the street." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Engelhardt, who is active in the Western States Petroleum Assn., an 
industry trade group, said most industry officials are more concerned with 
preventing construction accidents, such as the Venice Boulevard fire, than with 
finding uncharted pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
"People are aware that it happens, that once in a while you'll find something, 
but I don't think that it's considered a big problem," added Engelhardt, who is 
also vice president of Santa Fe Pacific Pipelines Inc., a company that 
transports gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel throughout six Western states. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, city officials say, by their very nature, unidentified lines pose 
a potential danger. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what might be underground and what might be under pressure," 
said Provost. "I have to believe that (an accident involving such a line) might 
be as remote as an 8.5 earthquake. But it could happen. Anything could happen." 
</P>
<P>
Said McPherson: "It's like the loaded gun. It's not dangerous until something 
happens. Then it can be deadly." 
</P>
<P>
According to Dave Leatherman, an engineer with the city's Department of 
Transportation, Los Angeles has a total of 524 miles of private fuel lines 
running under its streets. Those lines carry crude oil, gasoline and other 
products used in the refining process, such as naphtha, a highly volatile 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been keeping pipeline maps since the early 1930s and has an 
extensive permit procedure that dates as far back as 1927. Pipeline companies 
that use city streets are required to obtain a franchise from the city 
Department of Transportation and must file their plans with the Bureau of 
Engineering. Companies also must notify the bureau when they abandon a line, 
and the abandonments are also recorded on city maps. 
</P>
<P>
But in some areas, particularly older areas such as Wilmington, oil lines were 
laid before the city laws took effect. Wilmington has had an active oil field 
since the turn of the century, and city officials believe there are many 
uncharted lines that were laid decades ago by private oil well owners. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Provost, Leatherman and McPherson said that during World War II, 
the military -- which maintained a strong presence in the harbor area, 
especially in San Pedro -- laid oil pipelines without notifying the city. 
Leatherman said his staff has asked the Navy several times to provide records 
of the pipelines, but "they have been reluctant to do that, possibly because of 
security reasons." 
</P>
<P>
But a Navy spokesman said Tuesday that the Navy knows of no pipelines in the 
harbor area whose locations are a secret to the city. Lt. Cmdr. Steve Chesser 
said that, aside from the lines that are active and on city maps, the Navy has 
just five inactive fuel lines, which run to its now-defunct fuel wharf at the 
Port of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Chesser said those lines were abandoned in February when the fuel wharf was 
shut down. The Navy is now in the process of turning them over to the port, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If Flores' motion is adopted, these and other issues would be explored further. 
The motion calls upon the city fire and transportation departments, as well as 
the Bureau of Engineering, to look into "the various problems associated with 
unidentified pipelines" and to report back to the Council's Public Works 
Committee within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
Leatherman and others have said the review would probably consist of further 
checking with agencies such as the Navy, as well as pipeline and oil companies, 
for records that might reveal uncharted pipelines. In addition, he said he 
would like to see city staffers draft guidelines for handling unidentified 
pipelines when they are discovered. 
</P>
<P>
The motion does not direct the departments to identify the city's uncharted 
lines -- a task city officials say would be nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"You would almost have to dig a ditch across every intersection on all four 
legs of the intersection and try to get a cross section of all the pipelines 
that are there," said Leatherman. "It's a huge, monumental thing to take on, 
and whether or not it's a productive, cost-effective, viable thing to do is 
quite another story." 
</P>
<P>
Added Provost: "I can't tell you too much about what we might find. If we don't 
have it (on city maps) and nobody else has got it, well then obviously it's 
going to remain until somebody runs into it."

Ten years ago, amid the chaos of the Iranian Revolution and the rise of 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Islamic fundamentalist regime, the migration of 
upper-class Jews from Iran to the United States began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
These were no ordinary huddled masses yearning to breathe free. This was one of 
the richest waves of immigrants ever to come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Their first toehold in their new land was no squalid, crowded "Little Tehran" 
but rather the gracious hillsides of Trousdale Estates in Beverly Hills and 
other nearby neighborhoods of the Westside and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Khomeini's revolution drove about half of Iran's 80,000 Jews into exile. A few 
headed for New York or Israel, but the vast majority of those emigrants, 
probably at least 30,000, have settled in or near Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Not all are fabulously wealthy. While some families have bought or built 
mansions north of Sunset Boulevard, at least as many are crowded into 
rent-controlled apartments on the south side of town. 
</P>
<P>
But whether rich or merely middle-class, they have, like most immigrants before 
them, brought change to their adopted home and have themselves been changed by 
life in America. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the Iranians came, this city was a sleepy city," said Beverly Hills 
real estate broker Stephan Saeed Nourmand, an Iranian who moved to the area in 
the early '70s and has been on hand for the wave that followed. "Sure there 
were celebrities, but it was still a small town. There was a gas station and a 
hardware store on Rodeo Drive." 
</P>
<P>
The Iranians, Nourmand said, brought more than money. 
</P>
<P>
"They brought their talents too. There were doctors, lawyers, businessmen, 
retailers, manufacturers -- a variety of people who came and immediately 
contributed by boosting Beverly Hills' international image," he said 
</P>
<P>
The stamp of Iranian success is seen in the glitzy Rodeo Collection, trendy 
shops and eateries on Rodeo Drive built by Dar Mahboubi, who is also part-owner 
of the fashionable Bijan boutiques of Beverly Hills and New York. Adrays, a 
chain of discount department stores, is owned by Masud Hakim and two partners. 
And Iranian-born developer Kambiz Hemkat is building a 22-story Center West 
tower in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere is the immigrants' impact more evident than in the Beverly Hills 
Unified School District, where nearly one out of every five students is 
Iranian. Their language, Farsi, is incorporated in announcements sent home to 
parents and taught in after-school classes to the children. 
</P>
<P>
The district has hired a full-time counselor to ease the transition for 
students and to sensitize administrators and teachers to Iranian culture. And 
thousands of dollars have been contributed by parents to the Beverly Hills 
schools through the Iranian Education Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this, many Iranians still manage to live their lives nearly surrounded 
in the culture of their homeland -- going to Iranian nightclubs, worshiping at 
Iranian synagogues, shopping for clothing and jewelry at Iranian businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Beverly Hills-area Iranians are Jewish, and in many 
respects, they form a community of their own. At times, however, they also 
function as part of a larger Iranian community that is estimated to number 
300,000 in Southern California. For Iranian Muslims, the largest concentrations 
are in Palos Verdes and Irvine. Ethnic Armenians from Iran have migrated in 
substantial numbers to Glendale, already home to a large Armenian community. 
</P>
<P>
There is an 848-page Iranian Yellow Pages, listing 1,600 Iranian businesses and 
professionals in Southern California. There are Iranian magazines and 
television and radio shows. Concerts of Persian music, featuring such noted 
Iranian singers as Moine, Darioush or Shahram, often perform at Hollywood's 
Palace theater before audiences of 1,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
On most Sunday afternoons, Iranian families gather for picnics on the Palisades 
in Santa Monica, where mothers parade their teen-age daughters in front of 
prospective sons-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
The influx has transformed a stretch of Westwood Boulevard south of Wilshire 
into an Iranian Main Street, where the aromas of shish kebab and rice hang in 
the air, where Iranian grocery stores stock hard-to-find Persian foods and 
spices and where bookstores offer books and tapes in Farsi -- including some 
that recall the "glorious days" under Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi. 
</P>
<P>
Iranians have also contributed to the night life in Westwood and Beverly Hills. 
Stores and restaurants stay open longer, catering to Iranian families who tend 
to eat and shop later in the evening. And festive Iranian parties go on until 
the early hours of the morning -- at times ending at the request of the Beverly 
Hills police. 
</P>
<P>
"At restaurants, the locals clear out by 9 p.m., and that's when the Iranians 
are coming in," said Irwin Kaplan, the former director of city planning in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Every Tuesday night, the Omarkhayam Restaurant on Westwood Boulevard becomes a 
Who's Who of former celebrities, government officials and other notables from 
the days of the Shah as they gather with families and friends for an evening of 
dinner and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA sociologist Ivan Light, who is studying the Iranian immigration under a 
grant from the National Science Foundation, said the influx is extraordinary 
for its number of "high-status immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Jewish and Muslim immigrants, according to Light, are drawn largely 
from the privileged classes in Iran, tend to be well-educated and include many 
doctors, lawyers, bankers and other professionals. But there are also some 
differences between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
Muslims, he said, are somewhat more likely than Jews to have advanced degrees. 
Large numbers of Iranian Muslims have gone into real estate development and 
construction. The Jews, meanwhile, are more likely to be self-employed with 
backgrounds in trade and manufacturing of apparel and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Light has also found that all of the Iranian subgroups are more dispersed 
within their new communities than is typical with other immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"With the possible exception of Westwood Boulevard, there is no central 
location for Iranians, like a Koreatown or Chinatown," he said. "We suspect 
that wealthy immigrants don't need those kinds of support systems." 
</P>
<P>
Jews have lived in what is now Iran for 2,500 years, ever since Cyrus the 
Great, the founder of the Persian empire, conquered Babylonia and invited its 
freed Jewish slaves to live in Persia. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally merchants and traders for generations, the Jews found great 
prosperity during the regime of the Shah, not just as merchants and 
manufacturers but also in government and the professions. 
</P>
<P>
But in spite of a history in Iran that predated Islam by more than 1,000 years, 
the Jews were never more than a tiny minority in a country that is about 98% 
Muslim. Iranian Jews who have come to California say they always knew the day 
might come when they would have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they were a minority in Iran, they always felt insecure, and many made 
sure they invested outside the country," said Baroukh Beroukhim, former 
president of Ettefak school, a 2,000-student private Jewish academy in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
"They even sent their children abroad to go to school as a means of having a 
little branch out there somewhere that would become the only hope if things got 
bad,' he said.' 
</P>
<P>
Beroukhim, who now lives in Westwood, is active in the Iranian Education 
Foundation and the Iranian Jewish Federation Council. 
</P>
<P>
Many Jews who left Iran in the days immediately before and after the Shah's 
downfall in early 1979 say it was not overt religious persecution by Islamic 
fundamentalists that forced them into exile. Far more threatening, they say, 
was the general chaos and the enmity that Khomeini's followers seemed to feel 
toward wealth in general. 
</P>
<P>
The memory is still painful for Guity Nemani, who abandoned a successful family 
rug business, her home and most of her belongings in the city of Abadan, and 
fled the country with her husband and three children in 1978, shortly before 
the Shah was overthrown.

VACANT REDONDO RIGHT OF WAY A STEP CLOSER TO BECOMING PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite continued resistance from commuters who believe Redondo Beach needs 
more roads, the Lilienthal right of way -- once considered as a potential 
street -- moved a step closer this week to becoming a neighborhood park. 
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of the city's Recreation and Parks Commission, the City 
Council approved plans to install a bike lane, sandbox, restrooms and grassy 
slopes on the vacant lot between the end of Lilienthal Lane and the beginning 
of Anza Avenue at 190th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The $200,000 project, expected to take three months to complete, will break 
ground this summer. Initially, the 1.5-acre park site was acquired by the city 
as a right of way for a street that would link Anza Avenue to the smaller 
residential streets north of 190th Street. 
</P>
<P>
That latter plan still has some supporters, who persisted Tuesday night in 
their attempts to persuade the council to make the vacant lot into a street. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Jackson, who lives on nearby Rindge Lane, argued that a new thoroughfare 
would be the only way to funnel commuter traffic away from his congested 
residential street, and Richard Houser, who also lives near -- but not on -- 
Lilienthal Lane, accused the city council of being "park-happy." 
</P>
<P>
But another longstanding park opponent, Councilman Terry Ward, said Tuesday he 
had changed his mind and now supports a park there. Ward said he has been 
convinced that a new road in the area would only encourage out-of-town 
commuters to continue short-cutting through the narrow and already gridlocked 
neighborhoods of North Redondo Beach on their way to work at TRW.

MOBIL SHOULD 'STOP USING ACID' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Add one more "expert" to the list of those who are willing to risk 10,000 lives 
in a Bhopal-type disaster by permitting the continued use of hydrofluoric acid 
at Torrance's Mobil Oil refinery. This time it's a spokesman for the Air 
Quality Management District's task force on the use of the acid, which is 
satisfied with palliatives served up as adequate safety measures (Times, Dec. 
29). 
</P>
<P>
What the task force did not do is revealing. Quoting the Times article, "But 
the task force did not study the potential for human error in causing 
industrial accidents, which safety experts say is a leading factor in most 
major incidents. 
</P>
<P>
" 'People could be wonderful for a period of time and then do something 
stupid,' said David Schwien, an AQMD senior engineering manager working on the 
hydrofluoric acid task force. 'We worry about that here constantly. . . . It is 
basic to everything we do, but I don't know what to do about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
We're glad to help out with the solution. Stop using the acid. This may sound 
flippant but is based on 25 years of experience in reading monthly safety 
reports from a multiplant chemical giant. Each accident reported was carefully 
analyzed to explain why the accident occurred despite the existence of an 
elaborate safety manual. And the accidents ranged from broken bones to deaths 
and totally destroyed plants. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing is at stake here but costs for Mobil Oil. Balanced against the 
potential for a major loss of life, there is no choice.

JUDGE IN MONTOYA TRIAL SEALS FBI'S TAPES OF ROBBINS

The tapes of six secretly recorded conversations between Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana) and an FBI informant were sealed Wednesday by the judge presiding 
over the political corruption trial of Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
"I can't find a single thing in any of these transcripts that I can see would 
be helpful in the defense of this case," said U.S. District Court Judge Milton 
L. Schwartz, who is presiding over Montoya's trial on 12 counts of extortion, 
racketeering and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors said there is nothing in Schwartz's ruling that would preclude 
their use of the tapes in future trials stemming from the FBI's investigation 
into political corruption in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
The taped conversations -- between Sept. 11, 1987 and June 21, 1988 -- were 
secretly recorded by John Shahabian, a Senate aide who became an informant 
after being ensnared in an elaborate sting operation that was part of the FBI 
probe. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Montoya's lawyer, Michael Sands, Shahabian on 
Tuesday testified that in one of the conversations Robbins "suggested $40,000" 
would be required to win Senate passage of a bill to help a dummy FBI shrimp 
company. 
</P>
<P>
In another secretly recorded conversation, Shahabian testified Tuesday that 
Robbins told him on Aug. 11, 1987, that it would cost the sponsors less than 
$20,000 in campaign contributions for the senator to introduce the bill. 
However, on Wednesday he corrected himself, testifying that the date of the 
conversation actually was Sept. 11, 1987.

COUNCIL STUDIES ZONING AS WAY TO BLOCK SUNSHINE LANDFILL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council members asked for legal advice Wednesday to determine 
whether they can use zoning powers to pressure Sunshine Canyon Landfill to drop 
plans to expand into county territory. 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys were asked if the city can grant a zoning permit for changes at 
the landfill under a condition that the operator, Browning-Ferris Industries, 
withdraw its application for expansion beyond city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The request was made by members of the city Board of Referred Powers, which is 
headed by Councilman Hal Bernson, an opponent of the proposed expansion. 
Bernson's district includes the Granada Hills landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Granada Hills homeowners groups said Wednesday they believe 
the real purpose of the zoning permit sought by Browning-Ferris is to prepare 
for expansion onto 542 acres of adjacent land in Los Angeles County and are not 
needed to continue operations on the city side of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson sided with homeowners and said he believes that the improvements "will 
in fact be beneficial to the potential expansion into the county." 
</P>
<P>
BFI has asked for a city zoning permit to relocate a haul road and the dump 
entrance, construct a large sediment catch basin and install a new leachate 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris attorneys said the construction is necessary for the company to 
comply with City Council orders to stop dumping near homes in the southern 
portion of the landfill and move operations to a smaller northern sector of the 
landfill, where they are permitted to operate until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
BFI property straddles the Los Angeles city-county border. A city zoning 
administrator approved the BFI improvements last year, but homeowners asked the 
city Zoning Board of Appeals to review the decision. The case went to the Board 
of Referred Powers, however, because Joseph D. Mandel, a commissioner on the 
zoning appeals board, had a conflict of interest. He is an attorney with a law 
firm that also represents BFI. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the dump, which would more than double daily garbage intake to 
between 12,000 and 14,000 tons daily and extend operations well into the 21st 
Century, is under environmental review by the county and is the source of 
intense community and political debate. 
</P>
<P>
BFI attorney Christopher Funk said "there are some real misconceptions" about 
the construction plans and insisted that they are "not part of any plan to 
facilitate or further the county case." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson countered by proposing a measure supported by homeowners that would 
allow for the improvements on the condition that BFI drop plans for expansion 
onto county land. 
</P>
<P>
Three other board members, however, were reluctant to vote on the issue until 
the city attorney ruled whether it is lawful for the city to place conditions 
on development issues outside city borders. The matter is scheduled for 
consideration Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris attorney Linda J. Bozung said it is "probably not likely" that 
landfill operators would drop their application to expand the dump in order to 
pursue the improvements on land within the city. She declined to speculate how 
landfill operations would be affected if those improvements are not made.

MOBIL SUING OVER FEES FOR OIL WELL CLEANUP, SPECIAL FIRE SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. has sued the city of Santa Fe Springs for relief from costly 
annual fire and oil well operating fees that are designated to clean up 500 
deserted wells and pay for specialized fire services. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil claims the fees -- a $1,885-per-well fire fee and a $1,000-per-well 
annual operating fee -- are unfair and illegal. Mobil does not need the city's 
specialized fire protection because it can provide its own and should not be 
held responsible for cleaning up other oil companies' deserted sumps, according 
to the suit and Mobil officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The fees grossly exceed any benefit" Mobil will receive, according to the suit 
filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Mobil claims in its suit that it 
was unfairly singled out to pay the vast bulk of the fees. Mobil owns 304 of 
the 400 operating oil wells in Santa Fe Springs. Independent companies own most 
of the remaining wells. 
</P>
<P>
City officials deny singling out Mobil and say the fees are justified. 
</P>
<P>
Debate over the annual oil well fee started two years ago when the city's 
Redevelopment Agency increased annual fees by 300%, to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The fee increase is a result of what's taken place in the last couple of years 
in realizing that there has been a lot of contamination of the soil . . . which 
has really come about because of the oil field," Richard Weaver, former city 
planning and development director, told the Redevelopment Agency at the time. 
"A source of funds is needed to deal with these problems." 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimated that it would cost at least $50,000 to clean up each 
well. On large parcels with many abandoned wells, the costs could total 
millions of dollars. Recently, Santa Fe Springs spent $4.1 million to clean up 
61 acres on an abandoned oil field before the Heritage Corporate Center, an 
office and recreation complex, was built in the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the city proposed tripling the annual fee to $3,000 per well, which 
would have made well fees in Santa Fe Springs among the highest in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. Again, city officials said more money was needed to clean 
up the oil companies' legacy of contamination and change the image of the city 
from an aging oil town to a community with attractive shopping centers and 
office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But city planners, fearful that the 200% increase was not legally defensible, 
dropped the idea and proposed the $1,885 fire fee instead. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. Wilson, the city's fire chief, said 22% of the Fire Department's 
$6.5-million budget is spent for special equipment, training and other services 
needed to battle a fire or hazardous chemical leak at the oil fields and 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
The money the city normally allocates to the Fire Department for protecting the 
oil industry could be placed in a fund for cleaning up the old sumps, a 
roundabout way to solve the environmental problems. The fire fee was passed by 
the City Council in November and was expected to generate about $917,000 
annually. The city's two refineries, Powerine and Golden West Refining Co., 
were each ordered to pay an annual fire fee of $81,500. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said all but two small oil companies have paid the fire fees that were 
due Dec. 7. Mobil paid $400,000 and agreed to pay the remaining $173,000 later. 
All the fees have been deposited in a special bank account until the suit is 
settled, according to Leigh DeSantis, assistant director of planning and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
John Mueller, an attorney for Mobil, said the oil company paid the fee so it 
could show the court that it complied with the city rule, even though it does 
not agree with it.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN CONVICTED IN SERIES OF ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster man was convicted by a San Fernando Superior Court jury Wednesday 
on 18 counts of robbery for a string of holdups at small stores in the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmie Thomas, 37, faces a maximum sentence of 28 years in state prison for the 
robberies, which occurred between Dec. 30, 1988, and Feb. 4, 1989, and for the 
special allegation that in eight of the incidents he used a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel Damon said Thomas chose small stores with few 
employees and usually posed as a customer to scout the target. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Damon said, he approached the cashiers and demanded that they give him 
money, threatening to "blow their brains out." 
</P>
<P>
In eight of the robberies, he threatened the employees with a small handgun. 
</P>
<P>
During the others, he simply told the employees that he was armed, Damon said. 
</P>
<P>
He usually escaped with several hundred dollars, though he netted only $15 in 
one robbery and got as much as $5,000 in another. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas was arrested on Feb. 7 in a Lancaster supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
One of his victims was also shopping there, and called the police after 
recognizing him, Damon said. 
</P>
<P>
After Thomas' arrest, the other victims identified him from photos and a 
lineup, Damon said.

LANCASTER GOING OUT OF DISTRICT FOR NEW CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lancaster School District broke with tradition Wednesday by launching a 
search outside the school system for a new superintendent -- the district's 
fourth in two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Trustees voted 4-0 to award a $10,000 contract to the 
Sacramento-based California School Boards Assn. to conduct the search. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the fast-growing, 10,600-student district said they expect to hire 
a superintendent by June. 
</P>
<P>
For at least a decade, the board has promoted superintendents from within. But 
board member William Taylor said the current board opted for the search to 
bolster public confidence in the process and to "try to bring about some sense 
of impartiality." 
</P>
<P>
The district has gone through a series of administrative changes since 
February, 1988, when Charles Gastineau was demoted from superintendent and 
replaced by E. Jarold Wright. That controversial move -- leading to charges of 
favoritism by board members who were friends of Wright -- led to a recall 
election that ousted three of the five board members. The new board forced out 
Wright last July, replacing him with interim Supt. Edward Goodwin. 
</P>
<P>
Goodwin, who was the district's assistant superintendent for education 
services, is expected to return to his old job, which has remained vacant. And 
although candidates inside the district will be considered, board members have 
said they expect to hire an outsider as the new superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Montgomery, assistant executive director of the California School 
Boards Assn. -- which represents school boards to the state government and 
conducts personnel hunts -- said his group will notify more than 400 college 
placement offices of the vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
Board members have indicated the new superintendent will receive a salary 
greater than the $73,000 paid to Goodwin.

5 IN RUNNING FOR VACANT SEAT ON SOUTH COAST SMOG BOARD 
</P>

<P>
The mayor of San Dimas and a Covina councilman face each other and three other 
opponents in a contest for a seat on the 12-member board of the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
The election was forced by the resignation of Baldwin Park Mayor Leo King on 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
King represented the 61 cities of the board's eastern region, which stretches 
from Long Beach to Pomona and as far north as Santa Clarita. A delegate from 
each of the cities will be allowed to cast one vote Jan. 4 during the election 
for King's successor at the district's headquarters in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
A complicated voting formula will determine the winner. To be elected, a 
candidate must receive votes from at least two-thirds, or 41, of the eastern 
region's cities, whose combined populations must represent at least two-thirds 
of the residents of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Covina Councilman Henry M. Morgan and San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple are the two 
San Gabriel Valley candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 62, retired two years ago after a 35-year career in marketing and 
management with IBM. He has served on the council since 1978 and has been 
active in regional government affairs. In October, he became a member of the 
Los Angeles County Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a zealot for the environment," Morgan said, "but I certainly agree 
with everybody that the environment's something we've got to nurture. 
</P>
<P>
"Clean air. You've got to do it," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Dipple, 36, was elected to the San Dimas council more than 13 years ago. He 
runs his own planning, development and real estate investment consulting firm.

WOOLRIDGE REFRESHES THE LAKERS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO BASKETBALL: LOS ANGELES FORWARD COMES OFF BENCH TO SCORE 24 POINTS IN 
114-98 VICTORY OVER NUGGETS. 
</P>

<P>
No longer does Pat Riley look past Orlando Woolridge when scouring the bench 
for help, as if the Laker forward were just another well-to-do fan in a 
courtside seat. 
</P>
<P>
As often as not these days, Woolridge is called upon to lift the Lakers from a 
self-induced malaise such as in Wednesday night's game against the Denver 
Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
Though he did not do it alone, Woolridge played a major role in averting what 
could have been a rare home-court loss, scoring 24 points to help the Lakers 
pull away from the Nuggets, 114-98, before 17,505 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
After missing the first 20 games of the season because of arthroscopic surgery 
on his right knee, Woolridge had been slow to work his way back into Riley's 
expanded substitution rotation. Wednesday, though, Woolridge was the first 
Laker off the bench in the first quarter and the last reserve to leave the 
court after victory had been secured. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Woolridge was a prime mover in the Lakers' fourth consecutive 
victory, which improved their record to an NBA-best 22-6. Woolridge made 11 of 
13 shots and surpassed his previous season high of 22 points, which he scored 
in last Friday's victory over the Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
Support came from Magic Johnson, who had 27 points and seven assists, and Larry 
Drew, who had four steals, a team-high eight assists and four points in 19 
minutes. It was the first time this season, other than the Nov. 7 game in which 
he was ejected, that Johnson has not led the Lakers in assists. 
</P>
<P>
Even more than Drew's contribution, however, the Lakers needed Woolridge's 
effort to overcome the Nuggets (19-11). 
</P>
<P>
"Coach has confidence in me now," Woolridge said. "I like that. I think that, 
now, Coach knows what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
But even Woolridge, who had trouble adapting to the role as a reserve power 
forward last season, admitted mild surprise when Riley picked him to be the 
first player off a bench that Johnson called the Lakers' "deepest I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't think about it until somebody mentioned it," Woolridge said. 
"When Coach makes the call, you just get up and play. You don't ask questions. 
But after a while, I was out there thinking, hmmm, I'm playing with (the 
starters). But I like it. I want to play the minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Inserted into the lineup five minutes after the opening tipoff, Woolridge 
helped the Lakers fight back from an early double-digit deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Then, coming in with 5:07 to play in the third quarter and the Nuggets leading, 
72-70, Woolridge and Drew led a resurgence that gave the Lakers an 84-76 lead 
entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
As if afraid to stop a good thing, Riley stayed with Woolridge almost the 
entire fourth quarter, the Laker forward responding with 12 points in that 
span. When Woolridge finally sat down with only 1:13 to play, the Lakers had a 
114-93 lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the final minutes of the third quarter that the Laker bench 
proved its worth. When play stopped for a timeout with 2:16 to play, the Lakers 
still trailed the Nuggets, 76-74. They had made only three of 18 shots in the 
quarter and Johnson was replaced by Drew. 
</P>
<P>
The Laker offense was immediately jump-started, and the Nuggets went cold. The 
result was a 10-0 run in which the Lakers went four for four from the field and 
the Nuggets missed the three shots they took. That run began with Woolridge 
sinking a jump shot with 2:06 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge and Drew continued to dominate in the fourth quarter. Drew came up 
with three crucial steals and Woolridge scored from outside and inside and even 
made both free throws he shot. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to do that," Johnson said of the strong Laker bench play. "We just 
can't look for me all the time. Larry Drew can push the ball and create things. 
And O (Woolridge) is hitting the jump shot now." 
</P>
<P>
Woolridge's ability to score from outside is what Riley and Johnson believe 
makes him effective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really nice now how he's worked on his game," Johnson said of Woolridge. 
"He's making the jumper and his free throws, too. He's worked really hard in 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
All of which has not gone unnoticed by Riley, who said that Woolridge 
approached him a few days ago and asked to play primarily small forward, the 
position for which he is most suited. 
</P>
<P>
"It took (Woolridge) time to adjust to our system," Riley said. "He's playing 
well. If he plays like that, I'm going to give him the minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Moe, the Nuggets' coach, was in no mood to credit Woolridge or the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought we stunk," Moe said. "It was one of our worst games of late. 
Maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way, but I didn't think (the Lakers) played 
that well." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers got 15 points and 13 rebounds from James Worthy and 12 points and 10 
rebounds from Mychal Thompson. Thompson was playing in his second consecutive 
game after missing the previous six because of bursitis in his still painful 
left heel. "(The heel) has sort of reached a plateau I can play with," Thompson 
said. "Before, it was painful to move."

JIM MURRAY: BREAKS ON GREENS DIFFER FROM THOSE ON BEAMS

Courage is a much overused word in my profession. It has been used to describe 
everything from boldly going for a green over 200 yards of water to trying to 
slip a fastball past Henry Aaron with the bases loaded. 
</P>
<P>
Some people think courage is facing down a lion with a high-powered rifle and 
scope sight, but others know that it's staring down at one with nothing more 
than a short spear and a flimsy shield. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino once said that courage was not playing a guy with tattoos and a 
scar on his cheek for $100, it was playing him for $100 when you only had $10 
in your pocket. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Smith once said that stress was not playing center field in Yankee 
Stadium, stress was trying to feed your family when you were unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
So Walt Zembriski will have to smother a laugh when someone refers to his 
courage in pulling off a dangerous shot in the senior division of the MONY 
Tournament of Champions at La Costa. He knows that real courage is walking an 
eight-inch steel beam on top of a skyscraper in a high wind with a rivet gun on 
a short wire. 
</P>
<P>
Courage is not hitting a high iron, it's walking one. Courage is not risking 
your nerves putting for $100,000, it's risking your life riveting for $13 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
You see, to play golf, Walt Zembriski first had to take off a hard hat and 
asbestos gloves and come down 50 or 60 stories to sea level. He was one of 
those guys putting up high rises 1,000 feet above Manhattan or New Jersey 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
If you're one who gets the bends and turns faint looking out over the parapet 
of the Empire State Building, if you even hate to look out a window above the 
50th floor, just imagine a guy who stood there, pounding rivets, a quarter of a 
mile in the air with nothing beneath him but a skeleton of steel girders. 
</P>
<P>
Even a circus aerialist has nets. The only thing to break Zembriski's fall was 
the ground. Or the Hudson River if you consider that any improvement. From that 
altitude, it, too, would be like falling on concrete. 
</P>
<P>
The worst thing that can happen to you if you miss a seven-foot putt is you 
lose out on some of Bob Hope's or ABC's money. You misread a steel beam, you 
don't drop off the money list, you drop off the universe. 
</P>
<P>
Zembriski has seen a lot of his pals miss the cut on the tour. But they get to 
tee it up the next week. He's seen half a dozen of his pals miss a step and 
they have missed the cut forever. 
</P>
<P>
There was Red Dalton, for instance. Walt had lunch with him the day Red stepped 
off that tour. Those were the days before the walkie-talkie method of 
communication. Dalton was signaled by flags where to take his stand on the 11th 
floor. The signal was missent. Red took a stand on a beam that was not 
fastened. He plunged to his death on the rocks below as the beam up-ended like 
a berserk seesaw. 
</P>
<P>
Walt saw five others pass him on the way down to their deaths. Another toppled 
into an empty elevator shaft when a barrier broke. 
</P>
<P>
You play golf in 75-degree weather in the Sun Belt. You go up in a high-rise 
scaffold if it's zero. You wear a glove in golf only to keep your grip from 
slipping. You wear a hat to keep the sun out of your eyes. You wear a glove on 
a building shaft to keep the rivets from burning your palms. You wear a hat to 
keep the debris from slashing your skull. 
</P>
<P>
Even the gloves didn't help Walt when two steel cables came together across his 
right hand and snipped the end of the thumb off. They rushed him to the 
hospital where the thumb was sewed back on. It's no help in his putting because 
there's no feel in it but, fortunately, the right thumb doesn't come into play 
much in the golf swing. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time the crane was swinging a load of lumber over the floor 
where Walt was standing. Someone misjudged the trajectory. Instead of going 
over Walt's head, the load came swinging right at it. 
</P>
<P>
He had two choices. He could leap, but since the nearest point of relief was 20 
stories down, that was really not an option, it was a calamity. Or he could 
grab onto the front edge of the lumber and hang on for dear life as it swung 
past. This, Walt did. And he swayed out over the city, clinging precariously to 
a cluster of 2 x 4s. He had to dig splinters out from under his fingernails for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
After that, how could a 25-foot, two-break putt ever make his heart pound or 
his throat go dry? How could a low iron to a guarded green ever top high iron 
with a load of lumber coming at you? What par-five could ever make your hands 
sweat? 
</P>
<P>
Walt got into the construction business originally because he couldn't keep up 
with the big boys on the regular tour. He got his card. He played the gutty 
game of the short knocker who had to work with four-woods where Jack Nicklaus 
and Arnold Palmer were feathering seven-irons. He couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
So he left the green grass and the manicured greens for the treacherous slides 
of prefabricated steel. He traded in his visor and alpaca sweater for a hard 
hat and asbestos gloves and went to building high rises for senior citizens and 
senior partners of Wall Street. It's a profession so dangerous that they prefer 
to import sure-footed young braves from the Blackfoot tribe to prowl the 
skeletal towers of downtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Walt climbed down when his marriage broke up -- his father-in-law was in the 
construction business -- and tried the mini-tour, the golf loop for players a 
cut below star level, trying to crack the regular tour. Walt was successful 
enough so he never had to climb into an outside elevator again. He won 15 
tournaments there in a little more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
How did he keep his game during his years of walking high iron? 
</P>
<P>
"I put down a carpet in the basement of my home in Jersey. When it was snowing 
out, I practiced chipping and putting on it." 
</P>
<P>
As soon as he got to be 50, Walt ran to the senior tour. At first, he had to 
qualify on Monday mornings. That is stressful but not to be compared to being 
50 floors up when a gale moves in. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Walt broke through. He won the prestigious Vantage Championship in 
Palm Desert, where he was the only player in a Who's Who field of senior 
golfers to break par. He pocketed $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
The senior tour now has its Mr. X, Miller Barber, and its Mr. Z, Zembriski. And 
this week, in the MONY senior division tournament, Mr. Z has a chance to become 
the game's latest millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
Why do comparative unknowns like Walt succeed where the superstars seem to fail 
in the seniors? Walt has a theory. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't practice enough," he says. "They think they can come out and throw 
a ball on the tee and win everything. They don't practice like they used to 
when they were on the regular tour." 
</P>
<P>
That may be the reason. On the other hand, it just may be they know they don't 
have to go back to walking high iron if their low ones don't work.

SIMMS ISN'T STYLING, JUST SMILING; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: GIANT QUARTERBACK DOESN'T HAVE THE SPEED OF CUNNINGHAM, BUT HIS 
LOW-KEY APPROACH HAS HIS TEAM ON THE MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As running styles go, quarterbacks Randall Cunningham and Phil Simms have 
nothing in common except feet. Each has two. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Rams invented a new defense -- no down linemen -- to curtail 
Philadelphia's Cunningham, an elusive enough bird to require all-night 
brainstorming and a one-use-only, disposable game plan. 
</P>
<P>
This week, it's back to basics in preparation for Simms of the New York Giants, 
a slow-footed, ankle-braced quarterback who limps and creaks when he breaks the 
huddle. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, you want to mention Simms' dashing, three-yard touchdown run 
against the Raiders a week ago Sunday, his first touchdown rushing since 1986 
and only the fourth in an 11-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Pretty as a Cunningham ad-lib? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I think so," Simms said of his run. "I finally unleashed it. The Rams 
dropped eight (defenders) against Randall to keep him from running. I just 
wonder if they're going to drop nine on me." 
</P>
<P>
Simms, truth be known, is fire-hydrant slow, yet his style has meshed well with 
the decor of this season's Giants, a team that has earned more victories than 
juicy headlines. 
</P>
<P>
For flash and controversy, it's tough to compete with New York's divisional 
rivals, the Eagles. Then again, the Eagles aren't competing anymore, having 
been eliminated in last week's wild-card game by the Rams. Keep those yawns 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
"We've won," Simms said. "Sometimes I wonder how. We may be more conservative 
this year than in the past. It's been backed up by the stats, but it's winning 
for us, and it's been successful." 
</P>
<P>
Simms has been through several stages in a Giant career that began in 1979. He 
has been cheered, booed, victimized and canonized. He had a 4,000-yard passing 
season in 1984 and a Super Bowl game for the ages in 1987, completing 22 of 25 
passes for 268 yards and three touchdowns in New York's 39-20 win over Denver 
in Super Bowl XXI. 
</P>
<P>
"No quarterback ever performed in a big game like he did," Ram Coach John 
Robinson said. "It was so methodical that it kind of gets lost in other 
performances." 
</P>
<P>
This season, though, Simms was asked to take a less-flashy role. These were new 
Giants, with lower expectations. Gone were yesterday's stars -- Joe Morris, Jim 
Burt, Harry Carson, Phil McConkey, Bill Ard. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Parcells decided to play the season close to the vest, hoping that 
solid defense and a conservative offense would keep the Giants in the race. He 
was right. New York won the NFC East title with a 12-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the Giants' victories were by 10 points or fewer. They have scored 30 
points or more only three times. 
</P>
<P>
Simms' 405 passes were his fewest since 1981, not counting 1987, the strike 
year. He threw as many interceptions, 14, as touchdown passes, but remained the 
rudder on a ship that vowed never to self-destruct. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it takes patience," he said of his style. "I think it's harder to play 
this way than it is the way Jim (Everett) plays, because Jim knows going in 
every week that he's going to throw the ball, regardless of the situation. It's 
easy for him to get into rhythm. I had many years here where we just relied on 
throwing the ball, and I always found that to be true. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, sometimes we can go three or four series without throwing the ball except 
maybe on third down. It gets a little tough, but I've never complained. I don't 
complain, because we're winning with it. Whatever it takes. It seems to make me 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
A younger Simms might not have handled the assignment as well, he said, 
preferring the wide-open attack the Rams employ. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get envious," he said. "Years ago I would have. I played like that for 
a couple of years. It was fun. But it wasn't always fun up here, because the 
weather can be so treacherous. I don't think Jim would have liked dropping back 
and throwing the ball every down in some of the games we've played up here this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my 11th year, so I'm just happy to go and make a couple of plays that 
help us win. I mean that. I feel very happy just being part of it. It used to 
bother me years ago. But now, not at all." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells says Simms is the same quarterback he was in his prime. It's the team 
that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We've asked him to do some different things," he said. "This team and this 
cast around him are different than it was three, four years ago. As a result, 
we're playing a different way. I try to take the personnel we have available 
and do the things that give our team the best chance to win. We haven't thrown 
the ball a lot this year. But if I want to throw it, Phil can throw it." 
</P>
<P>
Simms had figured he would be throwing a lot this season, with the Giants' 
future so much in doubt. Most saw this as a rebuilding year for Parcells, with 
Simms, one of the few links from the past, having to take on more 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
Simms said he guessed the Giants would be good enough for 8-8 this year, 10-6 
at best. 
</P>
<P>
"And I said, 'Yeah, the way I look at it, we'll probably have to throw it every 
down this year to be successful,' " Simms remembers saying. "I remember making 
all these comments to these guys, and the season has been just the opposite. 
We've won a lot more games than I ever thought we could." 
</P>
<P>
So Simms isn't much for style points anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably painful for a lot of people to watch," he said. "We've won a lot 
of games where you pick up the paper and it's, 'Well, they won, but they didn't 
do it convincingly, and it wasn't pretty.' " 
</P>
<P>
At this point in his career, Simms doesn't care. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just doing what I can do to survive here, that's all," he said. "I don't 
think I've adapted or anything, it's the way Coach Bill Parcells has decided to 
design his team. If I want to be a part of it, that's what I'm going to do. I'm 
glad I'm a part of it. A lot of people seem bothered by it, but when it's all 
said and done, our victories, of course, match up against anybody's." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams signed receiver Thomas Henley to a developmental contract Wednesday to 
provide another set of fresh legs for this week's practice. . . . Only two 
injuries were reported on Wednesday's listings. Ram linebacker Brett Faryniarz, 
who has a hamstring problem, and Giant guard Brian Williams, who has a knee 
injury, are both questionable.

Bobby Beathard officially became San Diego Chargers general manager on 
Wednesday, and went to work to build the team his way with a promise of 
non-interference from club owner Alex Spanos. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him when I accepted the job that I would like to be put in the same 
position we were in in Washington. We don't want to use the excuse that the 
owner has handicapped us," the former Redskins general manager said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the guys he's hired to turn this (club) into a winner and if it doesn't 
happen, then I would rather be the one to blame than say that somebody else 
caused it. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I am very optimistic about this. It won't be for lack of money that 
we won't win. If we don't do it here (win), it will be because I've done the 
wrong things." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard, who turns 53 this month, succeeds Steve Ortmayer, who was fired on 
Dec. 18, when the Chargers were 5-10. San Diego won its last game to finish 
1989 at 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Ortmayer's key aides, his personal secretary and the entire five-member 
scouting staff also were released. Beathard said he planned to rehire one of 
the scouts, Dwight Adams, and would fill the other positions during the next 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard's hiring in San Diego marks his return to football after a one-year 
hiatus as a network sports commentator and reunites him with Dan Henning, a 
former assistant in Washington who just completed his first season as Chargers 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of Beathard's contract were not disclosed. But Beathard, who owns a home 
in nearby Leucadia, said: "I want this to be my last football job. I love it 
here. I firmly believe this is the place to be." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard left Washington last May after helping to assemble the talent for 
three Super Bowl teams in 10 years as Redskins general manager. Before that, he 
spent seven years as director of player personnel for the Miami Dolphins, who 
appeared in two Super Bowls during his stay with the team. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby Beathard represents an outstanding addition to our organization," Spanos 
said. "He's one of the best in football in evaluating and acquiring talent and 
he will also be able to do whatever he feels is necessary for us to have a 
winning ball club." 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said he wasn't worried about working for Spanos, regarded by many as 
one of the league's more impulsive owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be here if I thought it would be the wrong situation. I would have 
gone somewhere else or stayed with NBC," Beathard said. "I came here because I 
was convinced the Spanoses (Spanos' son, Dean, is the club's vice chairman) 
were going to give us the support that we need to take this team in the right 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Alex Spanos said criticism of him as a meddlesome owner was 
unfair. Beathard is the third general manager and Henning the third coach in 
Spanos' six years of ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to laugh when I hear people call me a 'meddlesome owner,' " he said. "I 
am an owner, but I have to hire people to do the job for me and I have to trust 
their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"I just finished my sixth season and I can tell you I have so much confidence 
in the new operation I feel the next couple of years I'll be able to sit back 
and relax more than I ever have." 
</P>
<P>
During Ortmayer's nearly three-year tenure, the Chargers were 19-27, 16-27 in 
non-strike games. 
</P>
<P>
Since Spanos bought the team in August 1984, the Chargers have finished last in 
the AFC West three times. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said his top priority in the coming days is Plan B free agency, both 
from the perspective of deciding which Chargers players to put on the protected 
list and which players from around the league they might be interested in 
signing.

RODRIGUEZ FEELS HE CAN BE NO. 1 AGAIN; 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR GOLF: WITHOUT PAIN FROM A PINCHED NERVE IN HIS NECK, HE'S EAGER TO START 
NEW SEASON.

<P>
For six months last year, at the height of the golf season, a pinched nerve in 
his neck caused Chi Chi Rodriguez pain every time he swung a golf club. 
</P>
<P>
Then the pain left as quickly as it appeared, and now the popular Puerto Rican 
wants to be No. 1 on the Senior PGA Tour again. 
</P>
<P>
He opens his bid for the rating he last earned in 1987 in the senior division 
of the MONY Tournament of Champions, which begins today at the La Costa Hotel 
and Spa. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament is one of the few 72-hole events for the 50-and-older group. 
There were 22 tournament winners last season, by far the largest number to 
qualify for this event. For the second year in a row, however, Gary Player of 
South Africa and Bob Charles, the 1988 and 1989 money champion from New 
Zealand, decided not to play in the tournament that pays the winner $37,500. 
</P>
<P>
Among those Rodriguez will try to beat are defending champion Miller Barber, Al 
Geiberger, George Archer, Dave Hill and Orville Moody. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't win until the Crestar in mid-September, Rodriguez lost twice 
in playoffs, just missing a banner year. His $275,414 in earnings was the 
lowest in his four years as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I hit the ball, it hurt, especially in the hand," Rodriguez said. 
"Several doctors, including Dr. (Frank) Jobe, told me that the only way I would 
get better was to do stretching exercises and rest for three to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I did do the exercises and maybe that's what did it, but I woke up one morning 
in September and it didn't hurt. It hasn't hurt since. That's why my goal is to 
be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
When he joined the seniors for the last couple of tournaments in 1985, 
Rodriguez, the sport's stand-up comic, laughingly said he would have to make a 
lot of money in a hurry, because when Jack Nicklaus and Lee Trevino became 
eligible, he wouldn't have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome them both," Rodriguez said. "I know Lee will be a factor, but I 
don't think Jack will play often. He has nothing to gain. If he wins, they'll 
say he should. If he doesn't, they'll say he's lost it." 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez has an opinion on just about everything. Some of them: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He strongly supports the PGA Tour in its suit over the types of grooves 
that should be allowed on irons. 
</P>
<P>
"If the PGA can't make the rules, somebody will come up with a golf ball that 
will travel 400 yards and then what will happen? 
</P>
<P>
 -- He isn't really upset that after winning the first two senior skins games, 
he was not invited to play in Hawaii late this month. 
</P>
<P>
"After all, how often do you get replaced by Jack Nicklaus?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- It is a terrible thing for athletes to charge youngsters for an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should make money at the expense of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 -- There may be some doubt about who the greatest golfer is, but there is no 
doubt who the greatest Puerto Rican golfer is. 
</P>
<P>
And, he adds: He will never be as good for golf as it has been for him.

DESPITE HIS AGE, KITE SAYS SKY'S THE LIMIT; 
</P>
<P>
GOLF: PGA TOUR'S ALL-TIME LEADING MONEY WINNER THINKS PLAYERS REACH THEIR PEAK 
IN MID-30S TO EARLY 40S.

<P>
The adage that life begins at 40 would certainly be disputed by most aging 
professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
At that age, they're usually out of sports and pursuing other endeavors, hoping 
they won't be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Not Tom Kite, who turned 40 last month, and claims his best playing years are 
still ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Kite, who will play in the PGA Tour season-opening MONY Tournament of Champions 
starting today at La Costa, is coming off a fabulous year. 
</P>
<P>
He was the tour's leading money winner, earning a record $1,395,278 that 
elevated him to No. 1 on the all-time money winning list. He also was named PGA 
player of the year for the first time in a career that began in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
As for his age? "Forty is better than 25 as far as being able to play," Kite 
said. "You're closer to being in your prime at 40 than you are at 25. I don't 
think you come into your own until you get into the mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody makes such a big deal out of this 40 business. It's one day older. I 
feel I'm in as good a shape as I've ever been and, coming off the year I had, 
there is no way that I'm not going to approach this year as a very good year." 
</P>
<P>
Kite says that a pro golfer's best years are from age 35 up to 44. 
</P>
<P>
If so, Kite has reason to be enthusiastic about the future. 
</P>
<P>
He is at the top of his game. The only thing missing in his resume is a 
championship in one of the four major tournaments: the U.S. Open, Masters, PGA 
championship or British Open. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he is not setting any specific goals. 
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to call them dreams and everyone knows what they'd be for anyone out 
here," Kite said. "Once you reach the level that I am it's pretty easy to 
imagine what those dreams are." 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, one major disappointment in an otherwise exceptional 1989 
season for Kite. He failed to win the U.S. Open after leading by three strokes 
through four holes in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
He then self-destructed, hitting his drive into water at the fifth and winding 
up with a 78. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he feels that the Open owes him one, Kite said: 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing owes me anything out here. Golf is a funny game. It can be a cruel 
game and it can be very rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
"I had the best year of my life, but in some ways it was the most 
disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Calcavecchia is ahead of schedule according to Kite's estimate that pros 
don't hit their stride until their mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
Only 29, the long-hitting Calcavecchia won three tournaments last year, 
including the British Open. Kite and defending T of C champion Steve Jones were 
the only other players to win three PGA Tour events last year. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Calcavecchia was fifth on the money winning list with $807,741. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just going to try to keep improving," he said. "If you keep improving on 
your year before, which I've done every year since 1985, sooner or later you're 
going to run out of improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be difficult to top 1989, but my goal is to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has achieved more recognition since winning the British Open in a 
playoff with Australians Greg Norman and Wayne Grady, Calcavecchia said: 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't changed me in terms of the way I am, but it's changed the way people 
see me as a player. Now everybody considers me as a world-class player, which I 
am, but I might not have been recognized if I hadn't won the British Open. I 
would have been just another good, young American tour player." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he has any ambition to be the world's best player, Calcavecchia said: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if I have the mental capability to do that right now. I just want 
to win tournaments. I'm not out there trying to be the world's No. 1-ranked 
player. I don't care if I'm eight, six, three, or 12. Those are just numbers on 
the list. The only numbers I want to have on a list are tournament wins." 
</P>
<P>
Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
Only winners of PGA Tour events, including the British Open, are eligible to 
compete at the 7,022-yard La Costa course. . . . First prize is $135,000. . . . 
Among the prominent players in the field are Curtis Strange, two-time U.S. Open 
champion; Payne Stewart, the PGA champion, and Greg Norman, a two-time winner 
in '89.

VEECK AND MILLER DESERVE SPOTS IN THE HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each baseball season at this time, the Hall of Fame ballot comes. It's the warm 
spot next to the fireplace of the mind. Of the new candidates, Joe Morgan and 
Jim Palmer jump off the page. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan might have been the greatest second baseman of all time; I didn't see 
Rogers Hornsby. Palmer won 20 games eight times in a nine-season span. 
</P>
<P>
They need no argument. 
</P>
<P>
And I would vote for Bill Veeck and Marvin Miller. They provided some of the 
most modern and farsighted thinking the game ever had, whatever the troglodytes 
say. If baseball has greater popularity today than ever, they deserve some 
credit. There's no place for them on the ballot, for former players only. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the dark ages, Veeck understood that the game was a game and that it 
was entertainment. He understood that management can't guarantee a winning game 
for the fan, but it is obligated to make going to the game fun. 
</P>
<P>
He put together a winner in Cleveland with the Indians and pressed the New York 
Yankees for a lot of years. His 1948 attendance in Cleveland of 2,620,627 is 
still the most remarkable ever. 
</P>
<P>
Miller's efforts overturned the indecent reserve system. The new structure is 
less than perfect, largely because owners still haven't learned to evaluate 
players. 
</P>
<P>
If the players had any sense of debt, they would agitate for Miller's place, 
but memories fade with each paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
Veeck and Miller belong. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, players are selected by vote of the Baseball Writers' Association 
of America, which this year deals with players who were active between 1970 and 
1984, or by the veterans committee, which has no time restrictions -- and, by 
now, no real place. 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, when selections had to cover the half-century before the 
founding of the Hall of Fame, the veterans committee had a significant role. 
The mechanics of the veterans committee should be changed to something more 
appropriate than crony-ism. Charlie Gehringer, Ted Williams and Stan Musial are 
strong members of the committee, and in recent years it selected old teammates 
and buddies Rick Ferrell, Bobby Doerr and Red Schoendienst. They had been 
passed over by the Baseball Writers Association of America for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the august veterans didn't see that Phil Rizzuto belongs -- 
even though Williams has said that if the Boston Red Sox had had him at 
shortstop, they would have dominated the era instead of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Replace the veterans committee with a group that could measure the worth of 
Miller and Veeck. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest difficulty in selecting players is to honor the concept that the 
Hall of Fame is for great players -- standards set by the likes of Morgan and 
Palmer -- and not for very good players or players who managed to play a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
There are four players on the list of first-timers who played the requisite 10 
years but didn't average 100 games a season. Longevity isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
One spring, Pete Rose looked into the clubhouse of players he was managing and 
noted: "Some of them will have Hall of Fame months, and some of them may even 
have Hall of Fame seasons, but how many players have Hall of Fame careers?" 
</P>
<P>
Few. Fewer than are now in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unreasonable to measure new candidates by a new and vastly higher 
standard. It wouldn't serve to vote out those players who don't meet standards 
that should have been applied in the first place, but it's a thought. There is 
this self-deception with offense, particularly the home run. The Hall is not an 
all-star ballot, but there should be an understanding that you can have a whole 
lot of Harmon Killebrews but won't win. As Casey Stengel explained, "If you 
don't have a catcher, you'll have a lot of passed balls." Stengel said a lot of 
things. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan hit for average, he hit for power, he fielded, he ran, he played smart 
and he played arrogant. He is third in all-time walks, seventh in stolen bases. 
In 1976 he drove in 111 runs, scored 113, batted .320, hit 27 homers and stole 
60 bases. That was a landmark for a great player. Palmer constantly played The 
Bickersons with his manager. He said Earl Weaver didn't understand pitching and 
Weaver responded that Palmer didn't even understand Jim Palmer. Together they 
got a job done: Palmer was the best pitcher on the best team of his time. He 
threw a high fastball that looked as if it were bouncing over something on the 
way to the plate. He won 20 games eight times, which only five other pitchers 
have accomplished. Six times he pitched more than 295 innings. In 1975 he was 
23-11, pitched 10 shutouts and had a 2.09 earned run average for 323 innings. 
He never ever -- in 3,948 innings pitched -- gave up a home run with the bases 
full. 
</P>
<P>
My No. 3 is Orlando Cepeda. He hit a ton. He won with the San Francisco Giants, 
and when he was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, they won. And he went to the 
Atlanta Braves and they won. That's a pretty good measure of a man. He has paid 
his debt on a drug charge. No. 4 is Thurman Munson. He hit .300 and had 100 RBI 
for three successive years, which nobody had done since Al Rosen two decades 
before. His death after 11 seasons isn't reason to elect him, but he was a 
terrific player. He was the best catcher in the American League, and you 
remember what Stengel said about catchers. 
</P>
<P>
No. 5 is Bill Mazeroski. He won't get in because he didn't hit enough and too 
many voters think his homer to beat the Yankees in 1960 was the only thing he 
ever did. He was a very tough out, an incomparable middle man on the double 
play, and he led his position in chances fielded more often than anybody at any 
position ever. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 is Curt Flood. He hit .300 six times, and other than Willie Mays you 
couldn't find a better centerfielder. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 is Ferguson Jenkins. He won 20 seven times, six in a row, and he didn't 
pitch for the best teams. He led the American League in complete games once and 
the National League three times. You could build a pitching staff around him. 
No. 8 is Gaylord Perry. He pitched nearly 1,000 more innings than any other 
candidate this year and won 20 five times with mediocre teams. They always had 
umpires to decide right and wrong when he pitched, and they didn't say he 
couldn't throw whatever it was that he threw. 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 is Maury Wills. He brought the stolen base back from the archives and 
made it a total offensive weapon so Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale could win all 
those games. He is the ancestor of Lou Brock and Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 is Sparky Lyle. He's the 10th man. He has to be judged by a separate 
standard since the Hall has no exclusive relief pitcher. Nobody wins without 
somebody who can get the last out.

Holovak. Glanville said he still was coach of the Oilers, but afterward he flew 
to Atlanta to interview for the Falcon head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
"All we did was have our usual (season ending) meeting and everything went

Steve Spurrier, Florida's new coach, said he is so eager for a game against 
national champion Miami that he would play it before the regular season and 
outside the continental United States to get around NCAA regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Spurrier said that he and Athletic Director Bill Arnsparger are considering 
playing Miami in a foreign country because overseas games are allowed beyond 
the NCAA-approved 11-game schedules.

Penn State's decision to join the Big Ten Conference has strengthened talk 
among other major Eastern football independents about forming an all-sports 
conference, West Virginia officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents and athletic directors from West Virginia and five other schools -- 
Temple, Pittsburgh, Boston College, Syracuse and Rutgers -- met in Philadelphia 
to discuss a conference, said West Virginia University President Neil Bucklew. 
Nothing definite was decided, Bucklew said, but he added that West Virginia is 
making "serious explorations" into an all-sports conference.

The Kings' Luc Robitaille outpolled teammate Wayne Gretzky for the second 
consecutive season to lead all vote-getters Wednesday in balloting for the 
Campbell Conference All-Star team. 
</P>
<P>
Robitaille, a left wing who leads the Kings with 31 goals, received 298,914 
votes in fan balloting for the Jan. 21 NHL All-Star game at the Pittsburgh 
Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
He had more than three times the votes received by the left wing runner-up, 
Gerard Gallant of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty happy," Robitaille said. "It's always a surprise. I guess I picked 
the right position as a kid, left wing. It's always fun to be there." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky had 276,980 votes, more than twice as many as Detroit center Steve 
Yzerman. 
</P>
<P>
Also voted as starters were Calgary's goaltender Mike Vernon and defenseman Al 
MacInnis, St. Louis right wing Brett Hull and Edmonton defenseman Kevin Lowe. 
MacInnis led defensemen with 218,000 votes. Lowe had 187,091. The Kings' Steve

Bill Curry, who coached a bittersweet season at Alabama, went job-hunting at 
the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a 10-2 record, a share of the Southeastern Conference title and SEC 
coach-of-the-year honors, Curry has been criticized by some fans and alumni who 
favored hiring someone with ties to Alabama. Curry came from Georgia Tech in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Curry, accompanied by his wife, Carolyn, and son, Bill, spend the day touring 
the Kentucky campus and visiting with athletic officials. Today he is scheduled 
to meet the screening committee.

GAME OF THE '80S LASTED NEARLY AS LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT FACHET, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Choosing the player of the decade in the National Hockey League is no problem, 
because 99 of 100 no doubt would name Wayne Gretzky. Selecting the game of the 
'80s is pretty easy, too. 
</P>
<P>
When the conversation turns to overtime, people like to recall the 
circumstances in which they watched the conclusion of that four-overtime 
struggle between the New York Islanders and Washington Capitals on April 18-19, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone connected with the Capitals, Pat LaFontaine's goal after 128 minutes 
47 seconds was traumatic. For Greg Smith, it completed a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
In the second overtime, Smith rattled a post with a shot that would have won 
it. In the third overtime, he suffered a fractured kneecap. 
</P>
<P>
"It got to the point in that game that I wondered, 'Will we play this forever?' 
" recalled Smith, currently selling orthopedic implants in the Baltimore area. 
"When I hit the goal post, I couldn't believe I'd come so close without ending 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got hit with the shot in the knee it hurt badly. I tried to play the 
next shift and when LaFontaine went around me on the outside I pushed off on 
the knee and couldn't believe the pain. I thought sure he'd score, but he 
didn't -- then. 
</P>
<P>
"After that I had to sit on the bench, even though everybody was so tired. 
(Coach) Bryan (Murray) asked me, 'Can you go?' but I couldn't risk losing the 
game. The last period I stayed in the dressing room, icing my knee, and by the 
time it was over I was in pain physically and emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he often thinks about that night, but it is not his most unhappy 
memory of life with the Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think about that as much as the year before, when we lost to the 
Rangers," Smith said. "If ever the Stanley Cup was going to happen while I was 
there, that was the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never played on a team that played as well as we did against the 
Islanders. I was in the Stanley Cup final with Minnesota (in 1981), but there 
was no contest in my mind that the Caps were better. We just dominated the 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how we could go from playing so well to letting the Rangers beat 
us. I still can't answer it. I guess if I could I wouldn't be thinking about 
it. But with Edmonton beat out, things were taking shape. That was the Caps' 
year. I still feel that way today." 
</P>
<P>
Of six Washington players on the ballot for the Prince of Wales Conference's 
all-star team, announced this week, Geoff Courtnall received the most votes, 
115,506. Others: Dino Ciccarelli, 74,563; Bob Joyce, 71,129; Scott Stevens, 
66,749; Mike Ridley, 48,793; Kevin Hatcher, 28,239. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of the Wales roster for the Jan. 21 game will be selected by 
Montreal Coach Pat Burns. Each team must be represented by at least one player. 
</P>
<P>
After putting the Gretzky experience behind them, the Edmonton Oilers have 
returned to their accustomed spot at the top of the Smythe Division. Defenseman 
Kevin Lowe said: "I really believe we're back on track this year. The whole 
Gretzky thing was devastating to everyone and, looking back, none of us 
realized how uptight we were last year. A lot of guys were lost for the entire 
season. But the new guys are fitting in well and the Stanley Cup veterans -- 
well, we're still young enough to do it again." ... 
</P>
<P>
One of the veterans, defenseman Randy Gregg, has been combining hockey with his 
offseason work as a practicing physician. On a flight from Minneapolis to 
Edmonton, Gregg treated a passenger who suffered a mild heart attack, making a 
proposed emergency landing in Regina, Saskatchewan, unnecessary. Earlier, Gregg 
assisted Grant Fuhr when the goalie suffered an appendicitis attack during 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux has been selected as male athlete of the decade in Pittsburgh, 
topping Mike Webster of the Steelers and two-time Olympic hurdles champion 
Roger Kingdom. ... Latest chapter of the Sutter family Christmas: Chicago's 
Duane skated in front of the St. Louis bench before a recent game and wished 
brother Brian a Merry Christmas. Replied the Blues' coach: "Buzz off. I'm here 
to win a hockey game, not to talk to my family." ... 
</P>
<P>
Who says hockey fighters are dumb? Minnesota's Basil McRae uses Velcro strips 
to hold the sleeves of his sweater together. When an opponent grabs the 
sleeves, they come apart, giving McRae room to swing. ... 
</P>
<P>
Who says hockey fighters are smart? McRae has a date Friday with Brian O'Neill, 
the NHL's executive vice president, to explain the match penalty he received 
for kneeing Chicago's Mike Peluso last Wednesday. That is just one phase of a 
meeting that also will inquire into the circumstances of the pre-game fight 
that night between the North Stars and Blackhawks. ... 
</P>
<P>
Player of the week in the NHL is Winnipeg goalie Bob Essensa, who allowed six 
goals in three victories last week. Essensa, called up from Moncton Nov. 9, has 
a 7-2-2 record with a 2.68 goals against.

HARBOR LEADS BY 1 AT THE HALF BUT FALTERS TO LOSE TO LACC, 117-92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
After watching the Los Angeles Harbor College basketball team's play in the 
first half of their Southern California Conference opener against L.A. City 
College, Seahawk Coach Ken Curry seemed pleased. 
</P>
<P>
His team led by one point at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Curry wasn't as pleased with his team's performance after the game. The 
Seahawks were defeated 117-92 Wednesday night at LACC. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the worst half of basketball we have played all season," Curry said. 
"We didn't do anything right." 
</P>
<P>
With the loss, Harbor dropped to 14-9, 0-1 in SCC. LACC improved to 11-8, 1-0 
in the SCC. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for the Seahawks, LACC Coach Reggie Morris said he noticed 
something towards the end of the first half. "I saw that they (Harbor) looked 
as if they were beginning to tire," Morris said. "I decided that it was time to 
turn up the defensive pressure in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs went into a full-court press three minutes into the second half and 
that move blew the game wide open. The pressure defense sparked the Cubs to a 
19-9 run and a 78-66 lead. Harbor could draw no closer than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Marcus Nash of LACC led all scorers with 34. Eric Carpenter and Eddie 
Shannon each had 21 points to lead Harbor.

DAD LIFTS WESTCHESTER PLAYER SUSPENSION -- JUST IN TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS

<TEXT>
<P>
Senior forward Robert Hamiter has sat out all but one game for Westchester 
High's basketball team this season because he was ruled academically 
ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
Not by the school. By his father. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester Coach Ed Azzam said Hamiter's father, in a unique arrangement, does 
not allow his son to play unless he maintains at least a 3.0 grade-point 
average. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City Section athletes must carry at least a 2.0 GPA with no F grades to 
remain eligible. Hamiter meets those standards, but he has watched the Comets 
from the sidelines in 14 of their first 15 games because of his father's edict. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm behind the dad 100%," Azzam said. "It's been a little frustrating, though. 
The other guys are playing well and playing hard, but we're not real big. We 
have a 6-8 junior (LeRoi O'Brien), but everybody else is around 6 foot." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 Hamiter, a transfer from Florida, has not played since the Comets' 
opener against Cleveland of Reseda. Over the holidays, though, his progress 
report indicated his grades are again above a 3.0 average. 
</P>
<P>
The timing couldn't be better. Westchester opens Coastal Conference play Friday 
against University High of West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes us a notch better," Azzam said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson basketball Coach Rich Masson was happy with his team's performance last 
week in the Las Vegas Valley Tournament, but not with the officiating. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts lost to Bonanza of Las Vegas, 73-64, in Saturday's championship game 
after three of their best players -- Nkosi Littleton, Michael Ross and Bobby 
Kelly -- fouled out in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to beat a Vegas team in Vegas," Masson said. "It was a bad scene." 
</P>
<P>
Masson said the officiating was so one-sided that a Las Vegas sportswriter 
apologized to him after Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the second-worst officiating I've ever seen," he said. "The worst was a 
few years ago when we played Rex Chapman's (high school) team in Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
No one said life on the road was easy. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Keldorf, the talented St. Bernard sophomore who plays quarterback for the 
football team and is sixth man for the basketball team, lives in Manhattan 
Beach and is the son of Russ Keldorf, who helps run the Manhattan Beach Youth 
Basketball League at Mira Costa High. 
</P>
<P>
How does Mira Costa Coach Glenn Marx feel about losing one of the city's top 
basketball players to a neighboring Catholic school? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any problem with it," he said. "There's always been a good 
relationship between St. Bernard and Mira Costa. (Keldorf's) family wanted him 
to go to a Catholic school environment." 
</P>
<P>
Marx, basketball coach at St. Bernard in the late 1970s, pointed out that when 
Keldorf enrolled at St. Bernard in the fall of 1988, Mira Costa was coming off 
terrible seasons in football and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, both programs have undergone improvement under Marx, in his second 
season at Mira Costa, and first-year football Coach Larry Petrill. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll be able to attract some of the Catholic kids from now on," Marx 
said. "I wish him well, but I don't want to lose any more Keldorfs." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills basketball Coach Cliff Warren, who has guided the Titans to three 
straight Bay League titles, expects a dogfight for the championship this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"It's up for grabs," he said. "I think everybody is about the same. I don't 
think anybody is great. But at the same time, everybody is good." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside is an overwhelming favorite to win its second straight Ocean League 
crown, but Co-Coach Carl Franklin says it will not be as easy as some people 
think. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a lot of parity," he said. "From what I've seen, most (Ocean 
League) teams are winning games in the preseason." 
</P>
<P>
Franklin might be overestimating his competition. Of the eight Ocean teams that 
opened league play Wednesday, only two (Morningside and Mira Costa) had winning 
records. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone deserves an injury-free basketball season, it's St. Bernard senior 
Martin Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-4 guard missed his sophomore season with a knee injury and was sidelined 
most of last year with a stress fracture in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, though, he's healthy and making up for lost time. He entered 
Wednesday's Camino Real League opener against El Segundo averaging 15 points a 
game, tops on St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really been a pleasant surprise," Coach Jim McClune said. 
</P>
<P>
At 11-3, Narbonne's basketball team is off to its best start in years. 
</P>
<P>
And the Gauchos' record might be even better if 6-2 forward Derrick Dukes, a 
first-team All-Pacific League choice last season, had not moved to Chicago 
during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Rolling Hills guard Steve Clover set his second tournament 
scoring record last week with 108 points in four games in the Pepsi Classic at 
Seattle. The week before, Clover scored a record 124 points in four games to 
lead the Titans to the championship of the Beverly Hills Tournament. The 6-4 
senior is averaging 26 points and five three-point shots a game . . . The 
powerful Morningside boys and girls basketball teams each lost their last two 
games in out-of-state tournaments last week. The boys lost to Bonanza of Las 
Vegas, 77-76, and Bishop O'Dowd of Oakland, 58-54, in the Las Vegas Valley 
Tournament, while the Lady Monarchs lost to Cannon County of Tennessee, 72-43, 
and South Pike of Magnolia, Miss., 67-64, in the Best of the U.S. Invitational 
at Shelbyville, Tenn . . . Five members of the South Bay Unit of the California 
Football Officials Assn. were selected to work the CIF-Southern Section 
Division II final between Santa Barbara and Muir on Dec 9: Bill Agopian of 
Westchester, Chad Brown of Carson, Robert Salcido of Manhattan Beach, Larry 
Daniels of Hermosa Beach and Greg Fucci of Redondo Beach . . . Former North 
Torrance High and USC volleyball star Lawrence Hom is a graduate assistant 
coach at USC.

TORRANCE HIGH GUARD PROVES A TOP GUN ON VARSITY, TOO; 
</P>
<P>
PREP BASKETBALL: CRITICS SAID RICK ROBISON WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME SCORING WHEN 
HE GRADUATED TO THE VARSITY RANKS. WELL, AS A JUNIOR HE AVERAGED 28.6 POINTS A 
GAME AND IS AVERAGING 34 AS A SENIOR.

<P>
When Rick Robison was on the freshman basketball team at Torrance High, he 
averaged 24 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Big deal, observers said, he's just playing against freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
As a sophomore on the junior varsity squad, Robison averaged 26 points, but 
once again he heard the critics: The skinny guard would wilt against varsity 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Robison didn't wilt, he blossomed. The sharpshooter averaged 28.6 points, 10th 
highest in the state, and was named to the All-CIF Southern Section Division II 
first team. Touted Ed O'Bannon of Artesia was the only other junior on that 
team, which included the state's all-time leading scorer, Tracy Murray of 
Glendora, now at UCLA, and Harold Miner of Inglewood, now at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his heroics as a junior, the 6-foot-2 Robison is hearing the criticism 
again. He's too small, he's too slow, and he won't be able to score now that 
everyone is prepared to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year people say he won't score, but every year he keeps on doing it," 
Torrance point guard Mike Sebaugh said. 
</P>
<P>
Robison is doing it again. The wiry 17-year-old averaged 34 points in the first 
nine games, tops in the South Bay and ranking him among the leaders in the 
Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked real hard during the summer," Robison said when asked to explain the 
scoring increase. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no doubt in my mind that his life revolves around basketball," 
Torrance Coach Bob Little said. 
</P>
<P>
Little said Robison scores in an offense that is not designed for him, unlike 
last season. "He gets everything off our regular offense," Little said "He has 
the same opportunity to score as the other players do. We have no set plays for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
This is difficult to believe watching Torrance play. In the semifinals of the 
Torrance Holiday Classic against Narbonne last week, Robison sparked a 
third-quarter comeback by scoring 10 points in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Every time he touched the ball, it seemed, it was fired toward the basket. And 
it usually went in. He took a pass off a fast break from Frank Tamashiro, 
pulled up four feet beyond the three-point line and buried a 23-footer. The 
next time he touched the ball he broke away after a steal, drove the length of 
the court and slam-dunked to the amazement of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, the dunk wasn't of the gravity-defying, backboard-breaking variety, 
but it was a slam. "He's real competitive," Sebaugh said. "When he gets into 
it, he fires everybody up." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Robison's lowest point total of the year, 22, came in the same 
Narbonne game when he was held scoreless in the fourth quarter. Torrance lost, 
77-66. 
</P>
<P>
Robison said the offense doesn't have to focus on him, but he's not shy about 
shooting: "If I feel I can make it, I take the shot." 
</P>
<P>
Most teams play Torrance man-to-man and frequently double-team Robison. "I like 
when they play man-to-man because if they double team, there will always be a 
man open." 
</P>
<P>
That unselfish attitude makes Robison, who averages five assists a game, a 
favorite among teammates. "There is a very good climate on the team with Ricky 
and the other guys," Little said. "They enjoy watching him play." 
</P>
<P>
Opposing coaches aren't so fond of Robison, but they admire his ability. North 
Torrance Coach Jim Nielsen watched Robison riddle his team for 37 points in 
Torrance's victory over the Saxons in the third-place game of the Torrance 
Holiday Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tremendous talent," Nielsen said. "He can shoot the ball. He is a pure 
scorer and a great foul shooter." 
</P>
<P>
Foul shooting is one of the keys to Robison's scoring. Anybody who takes a lot 
of shots is fouled a great deal, and Robison has capitalized. He is shooting 
90% from the line, averaging 12 points a game just in that category. 
</P>
<P>
The next step in Robison's development would be an offense that is designed to 
get him shots. "I've been thinking about it," Little said. "We'll probably have 
something installed by the second round of the league season." 
</P>
<P>
Who knows what Robison could score in an offense designed for him, considering 
what he has done so far. He opened the season by scoring 23, 28, 39, 41 and 52 
points. The 52-point game came against Huntington Beach in an Orange County 
tournament. "After he kept going up like that, I thought, 'Geez, what will 
happen next?' " Little said. 
</P>
<P>
Robison has cooled off to his torrid 34-point average, but his thoughts at this 
time are with the team: "I hope to go at least as far as we did last year." 
</P>
<P>
As a junior, he led the Tartars to a third-place Bay League finish and a 
quarterfinal appearance in the Southern Section 4-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Robison hopes to earn an athletic scholarship to play college basketball. He 
has a college-qualifying score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Oregon State 
and UC Irvine have shown interest, but some believe that Robison's game is not 
complete for college play. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's as good a scorer that has been around (the South Bay) in a long 
time," said Nielsen, a standout at North High and Washington State. "But 
college is tough. He's a little small. I don't know if he's physically strong 
enough. But he's proven people wrong before. If I was a college recruiter, I'd 
look at him. And if I needed a shooter, I'd recruit him." 
</P>
<P>
Robison acknowledges that his defense needs to improve as well as his size. He 
packs only 165 pounds on his 6-2 frame, but he's working on it. "I'm lifting 
weights and working out," he said. "I also eat anything I can." 
</P>
<P>
Presently, Robison is eating up defenses and ignoring the critics. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Sebaugh has known Robison since the eighth grade and knows not to 
listen to the naysayers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard what Rick can't do," Sebaugh said. "But I have learned not to put 
any limits on him."

CAMINO REAL, OCEAN LEAGUES; 
</P>
<P>
SHOOTER, REBOUNDER LEAD ST. BERNARD PAST SEGUNDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Point guard Terry Sullivan scored 19 points and center Wyking Jones had 16 
points, 17 rebounds and four blocked shots Wednesday night to lead St. Bernard 
to a 66-59 win over visiting El Segundo in a Camino Real League basketball 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first game in the competitive league for new member El Segundo, and 
St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune thought the Eagles played well. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen everybody in the league yet, but they're a good team," McClune 
said. "They're patient, they're well-coached and you don't get any offensive 
rebounds against them." 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard (6-5 overall) opened a 35-23 halftime lead and maintained a 
comfortable margin through the third quarter. But El Segundo (6-7) rallied 
behind guard Scott Panfil to pull within six in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Panfil scored a game-high 28 points and had five three-point shots, two coming 
in the fourth quarter when El Segundo hit four three-pointers. Scott Talanoa, 
the Eagles' brawny 6-5 center, had 14 points and did a good job on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside 111, North Torrance 70 -- The Monarchs opened defense of their 
Ocean League title in a big way, jumping out to a 14-1 lead and never looking 
back in a convincing performance at North. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Tyrone Paul scored 30 points to help Morningside (10-3 overall) 
snap a two-game losing streak. Guard Martel Bland added 18 and 6-6 forward 
Arthur Savage had 12 and played well near the basket. 
</P>
<P>
"They played super and we played very poorly," said North Coach Jim Nielsen, 
whose team dropped to 5-7 overall. "I thought they were the best team (in the 
league) before the game, and nothing happened to change my mind. Nobody is 
going to touch them, I think." 
</P>
<P>
Forward John Tymick paced North with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa 59, West Torrance 35 -- A hot shooting hand by guard Chris Hobbs 
helped the Mustangs rally from a two-point deficit in the first quarter and 
open the Ocean League season with a win at West. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 13-11, Mira Costa outscored West, 22-12, in the second quarter behind 
Hobbs, who hit four three-point shots in the period and scored 20 of his 
game-high 22 points in the first half. The Warriors shadowed Hobbs with a 
box-and-one defense in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs (7-3 overall) extended their lead to 44-27 in the third quarter 
behind forward Canyon Ceman, who scored nine of his 14 points in the period. 
Center Mike Ashenfelter added 10 points for Mira Costa, whose leading scorer, 
forward Chris Davis, was ineffective because of foul trouble.

CLU SHATTERS 13-GAME SKID WITH 67-61 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Cal Lutheran men's basketball team shut out Chapman in the final six 
minutes to post a 67-61 victory Wednesday night at Cal Lutheran and snap a 
13-game losing streak with its first victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
John deLaveaga, Carl Champion and Mike Demeter each made two free throws after 
the score was tied, 61-61, with six minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
The Kingsmen shot 63% (17 of 27) from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids deserve this," Cal Lutheran Coach Mike Dunlap said. "They've worked 
hard in practice and we knew this would happen ultimately, and they did it 
against a really good team. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for them." 
</P>
<P>
After 10 minutes in the second half, Cal Lutheran trailed, 47-41, then scored 
10 of the next 13 points to take a 51-50 lead with eight minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
During the 10-3 surge, the Kingsmen tied the score, 47-47, on three-point 
baskets by deLaveaga and Brendan Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran shot 47% (24 of 51) from the field. Chapman made 25 of 55 (45%). 
</P>
<P>
DeLaveaga, an off-guard, led all scorers with 33 points and Demeter, a center, 
and Dillon, a guard, contributed 14 and 10, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a monkey off the back," deLaveaga said. "It was like every game 
there was more intense pressure to win. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is unlike any other that wasn't winning. We never gave up on 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Andre Hill gave Chapman (7-5) a 33-31 edge at halftime, scoring on a breakaway 
layup in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran then outscored the Panthers, 36-28, in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Middleton scored 24 points and Hill scored 20 to pace Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
Frantz Reyes of Chapman had a game-high 11 rebounds.

CITY ROUNDUP;

<P>
WESTCHESTER RALLIES FOR VICTORY OVER SAN PEDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With its best player benched because of disciplinary reasons, Westchester 
High's basketball team spent most of Wednesday's non-league game against San 
Pedro trying to make the adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
It took 3 1/2 quarters, but the Comets finally succeeded, pulling away in the 
last five minutes for a 64-54 come-from-behind victory at San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Damian Wilson did not play because he violated team rules by 
failing to wear a necktie to school on game day, Coach Ed Azzam said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what it meant not to have Wilson, who was named MVP and led the Comets to 
the championship of the Malibu Rotary/Palisades Tournament last week, Azzam 
replied, "Twenty points and some defense. And a little bit of continuity too. 
It took our guys a little getting used to." 
</P>
<P>
Azzam said Wilson will most likely be back in the lineup Friday when the Comets 
open Coastal Conference play against University High at Westchester. "If he 
comes to practice (today) and follows the rules," the coach added. 
</P>
<P>
The players who did take the court for Westchester appeared in jeopardy of 
losing to a small but scrappy San Pedro team. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates were forced to go with a four-guard attack because of a calf muscle 
injury to center Roger Traynham. But what they gave up in size, they made up in 
hustle, opening a 10-point lead in the second quarter and holding an advantage 
until Westchester went on a 12-0 run to take a 59-50 lead with 1:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Comets improved to 9-6. San Pedro, which visits Crenshaw on Friday in a 
Southern-Pacific Conference opener, fell to 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Mike Mitchell led Westchester with 20 points, nine coming in the fourth 
quarter when the Comets outscored San Pedro, 19-8. Point guard Kelly Robinson 
added 16 and sophomore forward LaValle Ball scored 11 in a reserve role. LeRoi 
O'Brien, the team's 6-8 junior center, wasn't a factor until the fourth 
quarter, when he scored four points and blocked three shots. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro, which managed only one basket in the fourth quarter, got 16 points 
off the bench from junior guard Gary Herrera, a 5-6 ball of energy who helped 
give the Pirates a 35-29 halftime lead with eight points in the second quarter. 
He was the only Pirate in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, Pirate Coach Jack Kordich was pleased with his team's effort 
in its final tune-up before conference and league play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe you can gain confidence from a loss, but I think we did," 
he said. "We just ran out a gas against a bigger team." 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 71, Carson 66 -- Senior guard Jermoine Brantley scored 12 of his 
game-high 27 points in the fourth quarter to rally the Highlanders (9-6) to a 
non-league victory at Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Carson (10-6) led going into the final period but was outscored 25-14 in the 
last eight minutes. Guard Bobby Kelly paced the Colts with 18 points and 
forward Chris Aaron had eight points and 15 rebounds.

THE COLLEGES; 
</P>
<P>
POINT GUARDS DELIVER SHARP PERFORMANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Antelope Valley (14-5) and Moorpark (12-5) have compiled the best records among 
Valley-area men's basketball teams largely because of a pair of record-setting 
freshman point guards who believe it's better to give than receive. 
</P>
<P>
Dedan Thomas of Antelope Valley and Sam Crawford of Moorpark came out of high 
school with glowing credentials, and both have already set school single-game 
assists records and are on pace to shatter season records as well. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, an All-City Section 4-A Division selection at Taft High, set an 
Antelope Valley mark with 17 assists against San Diego Mesa and is averaging 
10.2. With 163 assists in about half a season, he ranks fifth on the school's 
all-time single-season list and is only 39 short of Mike Thompson's record of 
202 in the 1976-77 season. 
</P>
<P>
Should Thomas maintain his pace, he'll shatter the season record for assists in 
a game (6.7) by nearly four. The only benchmark for Thomas' performances is 
Crawford's exploits. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, a Westchester High graduate, has 155 assists in 15 games and should 
break Jim Amico's school record of 284 set in 1976-77. Crawford, like Thomas, 
has already set a school single-game record of 19 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Their excellence has not gone unnoticed. Crawford was the Most Valuable Player 
of the Midstate tournament at Cuesta College, and Thomas earned the same honor 
at the Golden West tournament as both led their teams to championships. 
</P>
<P>
Rising star: It's been a disappointing season for the UC Davis men's basketball 
team, but senior Tom Neumayr is leading the Aggies in scoring after playing 
only 13 minutes a game last season. 
</P>
<P>
A standout at Thousand Oaks High and Moorpark College, Neumayr is averaging 
14.9 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.7 assists a game after averaging 5.8, 1.5 and 
0.8 as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
The left-handed guard scored 19 points in Davis' 69-68 victory over Cal State 
Northridge on Friday night, 15 in a 87-59 win over Dominican College on Tuesday 
and is shooting 50% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has been a stabilizing influence both on and off the court for this team," 
first-year Coach Lonnie Williams said. "We're in a transition period. This is 
basically a new team from last year and Tom has really developed into a leader. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not a rah-rah type of guy, but he's a quiet leader. He leads by example. 
He doesn't say much to the other guys. He just goes out there, game after game, 
and gets the job done." 
</P>
<P>
That's been especially important because the Aggies have lost four of their 
five starters from last season. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has left the door open for Neumayr. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the odds: Though Davis' victory over Northridge snapped an eight-game 
losing streak and enraged Matador Coach Pete Cassidy, Williams figured it was 
about time. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the Aggies had played -- and lost to -- three other teams in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn., of which Northridge is a member. Davis 
lost to CCAA teams Chapman (90-80), Cal Poly Pomona (81-80 in overtime) and Cal 
State Bakersfield (61-55) before beating Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're 2-9, but we could easily be 7-4 or 8-3," Williams said after Davis beat 
Northridge. "We've just had some bad breaks in some close games." 
</P>
<P>
Lost weekend: After losing their second and third game in a row to Davis and 
Cal State Sacramento on Friday and Saturday, Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy 
wanted nothing more than to fly home Sunday and start regrouping for Wednesday 
night's game against Biola. 
</P>
<P>
But even that was asking too much as the Matadors' noon flight to Burbank was 
canceled because of heavy fog at the Sacramento airport, and they had to wait 
five hours for the next flight. 
</P>
<P>
Statwatch: Derrick Gathers led Northridge in scoring and rebounding in both 
games last week. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-3, 190-pound senior from Philadelphia had 18 points and nine 
rebounds against Davis and 16 points and nine rebounds against Sacramento 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, who is averaging 21 points and 8.2 rebounds, has led Northridge in 
both categories in five games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Fleet blocker: At 5-foot-9 and 175 pounds, USC wide receiver Gary Wellman is 
known more for his receiving than his blocking. However, the former Westlake 
High standout made a key block in the Trojans' 17-10 victory over Michigan in 
Monday's Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Wellman screened out Michigan cornerback Todd Plate at the five-yard line on 
Ricky Ervins' 14-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run, which broke a 10-10 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran and stalked (Plate) for awhile, then I was right in front of him," 
Wellman said. "I looked back to see where Ricky was cutting, saw him going to 
the inside, so I turned to the inside and walled him off. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not taught to knock the defensive back down or block him real hard, but 
just get in his way." 
</P>
<P>
Wellman averaged a team-high 18.5 yards a reception this season, but was 
limited to one catch for six yards against the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a little more conservative, dumping the ball off, because they were 
playing off and giving us the underneath routes," Wellman said. "Their 
secondary will not give up the deep ball. The one attempt at a long pass we did 
have, Todd (Marinovich) more or less threw it out of bounds because Michigan 
had it covered." 
</P>
<P>
Wellman considered the Trojans' win as a "ghost-busting." 
</P>
<P>
"The past two years we've had a ghost hanging over us that we couldn't win the 
Rose Bowl," Wellman said. "Now we've proven everybody wrong."

Bradley, a freshman tailback, led the Western State Conference in rushing 
yardage (1,334) and touchdowns (24) this season. Cheevers, a sophomore kicker, 
converted 44 of 50 extra-point attempts and 12 of 15 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Briggs, a linebacker who has also been chosen an All-American by the JC 
Athletic Bureau, had 37 tackles behind the line of scrimmage, including 20 1/2 
quarterback sacks. He was voted the Southern California co-Defensive Player of 
the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards had a WSC-leading eight interceptions for Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark quarterback Jayson Merrill and three teammates -- offensive tackle 
Kevin Elder, linebacker Jeff Lujan and defensive back Troy Thomas -- were 
second-team selections.

Eric Wynalda, a former Westlake High standout who now plays soccer at San Diego 
State, was one of 28 players invited Tuesday to report to the U. S. national 
soccer team's training camp when it regroups Friday to prepare for the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Wynalda, a forward, holds the Westlake career scoring record and led the 
Warriors to a 22-2-2 record as a senior in the 1986-87 season. He was invited 
along with six players who were on the U. S. national "B" team last year. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the team that helped the United States qualify for the World Cup 
for the first time in 40 years will be at the training camp, but U. S. Coach 
Bob Gansler is looking for scoring help. The Americans had just 10 goals in 11 
games last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly are going to attempt to augment our roster to improve in any way 
we can," Gansler said. 
</P>
<P>
The U. S. team next plays Feb. 2 against Uruguay in the Marlboro Cup of Miami. 
It plays either Colombia or Costa Rica in Miami on Feb. 4 and the Soviet Union 
on Feb. 24 at Stanford.

CHRONIC DRUNK DRIVERS RISK LOSING CARS; 
</P>
<P>
LAWS: THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE SAYS IT WILL AGGRESSIVELY SEEK TO SEIZE 
CARS OF MOTORISTS WHO ARE ARRESTED FOR THE THIRD TIME IN SEVEN YEARS ON 
SUSPICION OF DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED.

<P>
Chronic drunk drivers in Ventura County, who already face prison terms for 
their third conviction in seven years, now risk the additional punishment of 
having their cars confiscated and sold at public auction. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office, viewed as one of the toughest in 
the state in dealing with drunk-driving offenses, plans to aggressively 
prosecute repeat offenders under the state's new car forfeiture law, which took 
effect Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another tool for us," said Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen T. White. "I 
think it gets people's attention when they know they might have their car taken 
away. It certainly ought to increase pressure within families to avoid driving 
when drinking." 
</P>
<P>
White added: 
</P>
<P>
"If you've had two drunk-driving convictions in Ventura County and lightning 
strikes again, you're going to be walking." 
</P>
<P>
The new law, which has not received as much public attention as another measure 
lowering the legal standard for intoxication from a blood-alcohol level of 0.1% 
to 0.08%, provides that the courts can order cars sold upon a third 
drunk-driving conviction over a seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
The law provides that lien holders would be paid from proceeds of the sale and 
bans courts from selling a repeat offender's car if a spouse can prove that it 
is the only transportation available to the family. Proceeds would be used to 
support substance-abuse programs. 
</P>
<P>
Special Assistant Dist. Atty. Donald D. Coleman said the number of chronic 
drunk drivers who probably will be affected by the new law in Ventura County 
could be about the same as those prosecuted as felons for repeat drunk driving 
-- about 200 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, according to a Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman, the law could 
apply to up to 25,000 repeat drunk-driving cases a year. In 1987, the last year 
for which statistics are available, more than 17,000 drivers were convicted of 
their third drunk-driving violation in seven years and about 8,000 were 
convicted of a fourth drunk-driving offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the law, the court can move to have the car declared a nuisance and then 
sold, or the prosecutor can make the motion to the court," Coleman said. "It's 
one of those laws that can have a significant impact when used in selected 
cases, although there could be some prolonged hearings in cases where the car 
is the only family transportation and it is community property." 
</P>
<P>
Reviewing other new laws that took effect this week, officials of the district 
attorney's office portrayed them generally as a refinement of existing state 
laws rather than any significant departure from the past. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of that trend, White said, is the lowering of the legal blood alcohol 
standard for drunk drivers to 0.08%, which is expected to result in more 
drunk-driving convictions statewide while having less impact in Ventura County, 
where prosecutors already file drunk-driving charges on blood-alcohol levels as 
low as 0.06%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to assist us in prosecuting these cases, but we already prosecute 
so much in that area," White said. "Basically, the 0.08% law will make it 
easier for us to get convictions and will facilitate guilty pleas." 
</P>
<P>
One new law that will create additional prosecutions in Ventura County is a ban 
on the sale of semiautomatic weapons except to gun dealers and mandatory 
registration of such guns by January, 1991, White said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would expect there will be some prosecutions for unlawful possession, with 
up to a year in prison as the penalty," White said. "There are at least 55 
different weapons that are prohibited under the new law. This is one of the 
areas where we will have some additional work to be doing."

COUNTY PROPOSES 25-YEAR PLAN TO SAVE WATER; 
</P>
<P>
RESOURCES: TO KEEP SEAWATER FROM SEEPING INTO WELLS, OFFICIALS ARE PROPOSING A 
STRICT RATIONING PLAN. GROWERS AND TOWNS WILL BE AFFECTED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura County water officials are proposing a strict 25-year plan to ration 
the quantity of water that growers and cities pump from underground pools of 
water deep below the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are also considering an emergency ordinance to at least temporarily 
ban the drilling of new 
</P>
<P>
wells on the plain, the agriculturally rich expanse stretching from the beaches 
of Oxnard through the valleys of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction from growers this week is that the water rationing 
proposals will be an economic hardship, but that they are necessary for the 
long-range preservation of farm areas. 
</P>
<P>
The rationing plan, which requires users to cut consumption 5% by 1995 and 25% 
by 2015, comes with penalties for exceeding water allotments. But some area 
growers, faced with decisions based on economics, may opt to keep on pumping 
and pay the fines. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed fines would range from $50 to $200 for every acre-foot of water 
used by growers in excess of their regular allotments. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a certain quantity of water to grow our crops, and without that, our 
crops will suffer," said David Pommer, ranch manager at the 900-acre Utt 
Development citrus ranch in Oxnard. His operation, an old-style ranch that 
irrigates with furrows, could save water by converting to mini-sprinklers, he 
said. But that can be expensive, at an estimated cost of $1,200 per acre. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're planning on growing for 30 years, it might pay for itself," Pommer 
said. "But we're in an area that will be real estate in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinances, to be considered at a public meeting on Jan. 26, come 
after preliminary results in December showed a second finding of seawater 
intrusion into the lower aquifer system. That system, and the deep Fox Canyon 
Aquifer in particular, was previously believed to be uncontaminated despite 
decades of overdrafting, when growers pumped more water out than was 
replenished through rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1920s, seawater has crept into shallow aquifers, making parts of them 
unsuitable for grower or municipal use. Users consequently drilled deeper 
wells, tapping the lower system and contributing to the overdraft and the 
seawater intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, tests in November showed strong evidence of seawater 
encroachment in the lower system. The county is still waiting for final test 
results from the U.S. Geological Survey, which drilled the wells and performed 
the tests. 
</P>
<P>
The Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency, the public body that regulates 
ground water usage on the Oxnard Plain, plans a public hearing on the pumping 
restriction ordinance at the Jan. 26 meeting to solicit comment from users. 
</P>
<P>
But the need for the proposed emergency ordinance to prohibit drilling new 
wells may be temporarily relieved, said Lynn Maulhardt, president of United 
Water Conservation District and chairman of the Groundwater Mangement Agency. 
The emergency ordinance was thought necessary when developers of a golf course 
in western Camarillo asked permission to drill two wells that would draw 500 
acre feet per year. 
</P>
<P>
"The immediate question was whether a golf course is a good use of ground water 
in an overdrafted basin," Maulhardt said. He proposed the emergency ban to give 
board members time to study the issue in depth, he said. But developer Spanish 
Hills, has verbally withdrawn its request and will instead seek water from the 
city of Camarillo, which plans to annex the property, said John Turner, 
hydrologist with the county's Water Resourses Department. 
</P>
<P>
However, other board members may still want the ban in place to avert future 
requests before the board can decide on a permanent course of action, Maulhardt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed pumping restriction ordinance is designed to reach safe yield by 
2025, that point at which the water draining into aquifers is equal to or more 
than the quantity being extracted. 
</P>
<P>
It will set allocations and reduction requirements by averaging five-year 
water-use records, Turner said. Using information from the meters, which are 
required on all large-quantity pumps, users must report their water use twice a 
year to United Water District. The district has staff that monitors the meters 
and usage reports, checking them against the acreage farmed and crops grown to 
ensure the numbers correspond appropriately, Maulhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
After earlier drafts of the ordinance were distributed, some growers complained 
that those who are now the most conscientious with water use would be the 
hardest hit. A provision was added to assign credits for growers who are 
already using water at top efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Because there are only about 800 pumpers, most of whom are large operators 
including both growers and municipalities such as Oxnard, Ventura, Port Hueneme 
and Camarillo, cheating in reporting should not be a serious problem, Maulhardt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm not going to be naive enough to believe that this is not a potential 
problem," he said. Still, he believes United's staff and the threat of the 
fines to be imposed on those caught reporting wrong figures will deter the 
majority from manipulating figures. 
</P>
<P>
Growers' options for complying with the reduction ordinance include converting 
antiquated irrigation systems to modern, more water-efficient methods, or 
reducing their irrigated acreage. If the market were favorable, they could even 
change their crops from row crops, which are relatively high water users, to 
tree crops, which use less water. They can also continue to use the excess 
water, and accept penalties. 
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that over the next 25 years more technology will be available," 
Maulhardt said. "Who knows, maybe we'll figure out a way to use the ocean to 
water crops." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to one Oxnard grower, some farmers may react to the plan 
by eliminating low-value crops that use relatively high levels of water. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Underwood, partner of the Underwood Ranches of Oxnard, suggested that 
crops which might be eliminated would include broccoli or lima beans, while 
strawberries would not be as threatened because of their steady market value. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard Plain farmer Tom McGrath said he believes the reductions will be 
difficult for growers, but said he thinks water conservation is essential to 
the future of farming in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the way the industry has to go," he said. 
</P>

THE ENDLESS WAVE;

<P>
FOR A BAND OF SENIOR ENTHUSIASTS, THE UNDERTOW OF SURFING REMAINS IRRESISTIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN McALPINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's dead noon, time for most of the workaday world to grab lunch, run a rushed 
errand or begin pining for quitting time. On the back porch of his Faria Beach 
home, Jack Cantrell reaches into a storage bin and plucks out his surfboard. 
The sun is shining, the day is young and, a stone's throw away, there's surf to 
be had. 
</P>
<P>
"Last week I surfed seven days straight, I was actually getting surfed out," 
beamed Cantrell, obviously bothered not a whit by the prospect of doing it 
again. "Let's go surfing." 
</P>
<P>
A robust 61, Cantrell, a lifelong Ventura County resident, has spent the last 
37 years surfing local waters, one of a surprising number of surfers 
approaching Social Security without abandoning the sport they love. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people would generally be amazed by the number of older people who 
surf," said Paul Holmes, editor of Surfer magazine. "Surfing's a very thrilling 
thing -- it captures people's imaginations, they want to do it more and more. 
That applies to 16-year-olds and 60-year-olds. The fact of the matter is, if 
people who are surfing keep it up, there's no reason why they should have to 
quit because of age." 
</P>
<P>
"When I come out of the water, I feel like a newborn kid," said Cantrell, 
recently retired owner of an oil delivery company. "I've felt that way all my 
life. Why should I stop?" 
</P>
<P>
Many don't. Surfing legend Lewis (Hoppy) Swarts surfed into his 70s -- at 67, 
Swarts won a Grandmasters West Coast Surfing Assn. championship competing 
against surfers 20 years his junior. Dorian Paskowitz, a 69-year-old physician 
and professed "surf junkie," lives out of a camper van, parked, more often than 
not, at water's edge. Big-wave pioneer Wally Froiseth, also 69, still surfs 
regularly in his home waters off Hawaii. Surfer magazine's Holmes watched his 
father surf well into his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started surfing, he looked at it and said, 'Why not? I can do this,' " 
said Holmes. "He was 56 at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Holmes calls the older surfers "patriarchal figures." Others are less kind. A 
favorite seniors' surf spot at San Onofre beach has been dubbed "Old Man's" 
because the waves there are notoriously soft and forgiving. Age, however, has 
its perks -- among them free time and a thick skin. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't care what they say," grinned Kent Atwater. "I just hope they're saying 
it when I'm 80." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, a wiry 60-year-old Ventura resident whose license plate holder reads, 
"I'd rather be surfing," does exactly that as often as he can. A local real 
estate agent, Atwater has reached that comfortable, nothing-pressing era when 
life's immediate needs have been provided for and its other needs no longer 
seem so immediate. Which, from a surfer's standpoint, is nothing short of 
nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
"I can get out whenever the surf is up," said Atwater. "If it's good, I just 
hang it up and go." 
</P>
<P>
Age also has another advantage. Cantrell has become such a fixture in the 
waters off Faria Beach that each venture into the surf becomes something of an 
old-home week. Friends nod acknowledgments, and complete strangers paddle over 
to chew the fat. Over the years younger surfers have occasionally given him a 
hard time, stealing his waves and generally being a nuisance, but, says 
Cantrell, time has a neat way of taking care of that. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes there'd be a bunch who wanted to get rid of me -- they didn't want 
the old man there," said Cantrell, "but it always seemed like the guys who made 
it tough for you one year were your buddies the following year. They'd just 
mature a little bit. As a whole, people are really very nice to me." 
</P>
<P>
Surfer magazine's Holmes believes that those over 50 have reached a "golden 
age" when they receive a modicum of respect, and more important their share of 
waves, from the younger surfers. 
</P>
<P>
"The surfers in their 50s and 60s get better treatment than the guys in their 
30s and 40s," said Holmes. "I think that the kids really appreciate it that 
these guys are still getting out there and enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater has a simpler theory. 
</P>
<P>
"Either they respect my age," laughed Atwater, "or they're afraid I'm going to 
have a heart attack and die and they don't want to be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Atwater is not above broadcasting his age if it behooves him. Atwater 
celebrated his 60th birthday by boating out to Santa Cruz Island for a surf at 
one of his favorite spots. He arrived to find the spot jumping, eight-foot 
waves rolling out of the Pacific expanse and exploding onto a shallow rock 
bottom. Thrilled, he hopped overboard and paddled up to the small knot of 
surfers sitting in the water. 
</P>
<P>
"I paddled up to these kids and said, 'Hey you guys, this is my 60th birthday, 
so you have to let me have a wave," recalled Atwater. "They said, 'Fine, gee 
that's great.' I took one and screwed it up completely. . . . My reflexes 
aren't what they used to be, particularly if I'm surfing in a place where the 
waves are big and fast and I haven't been out in a while." 
</P>
<P>
A lifelong big-wave aficionado who stays in shape by swimming and playing 
tennis during flat spells, Atwater says there is really little difference 
between the Atwater of today and the Atwater of 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't get any more tired than I used to and, in my mind, I'm as good 
as I ever was," said Atwater. "And I tell you, I get just as excited about it 
now as I ever did." 
</P>
<P>
Atwater does, however, admit it may be time to impose some size limits -- a 
decision reached, in part, after a particularly severe drubbing several years 
ago on a 15-foot day at Rincon, a world-renowned surfing break on the 
Ventura-Santa Barbara border known for its sometimes large and powerful waves. 
</P>
<P>
"I caught this one wave and it just crushed me, ripped my leash and my boot 
right off my foot and spun me around underwater for what seemed like forever. I 
don't think I'll do that again," said Atwater, who, two years later was out in 
surf big enough to break his board in two. 
</P>
<P>
Like Atwater, Cantrell also recognizes self-imposed limits, then stretches 
those limits whenever it suits him. When there is something pressing on the 
day's schedule, Cantrell's wife, Joyce, signals the end of a surf session by 
hanging a towel over the porch railing. Familial obligations aside, Cantrell is 
on his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell when he's tired," said Joyce Cantrell, who often watches her 
husband from the deck of their home. "Sometimes I get concerned, but most of 
the time it doesn't bother me. He's over 21. He knows his limits." 
</P>
<P>
Well, yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's hard for me to get out," admitted Cantrell. "You always want 
that last wave to be a good one." 
</P>
<P>
Though it would be tempting to carry on about the experience years bring, older 
surfers are frank. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, you make plenty concessions to age," said Bill Lucking, who, at 72, has 
been an avid bodysurfer for almost 40 years. "I don't have the stamina that I 
used to, I get cold faster. Basically I'm not as tough as I once was. But it's 
still fun." 
</P>
<P>
So much fun that Lucking is in the water an average of six days a week, 
generally bobbing in the often roiling surf off Ventura's South Jetty, a 
popular bodysurfing spot. Though Lucking recently retired from his Ventura law 
practice, during his working days he was still a South Jetty regular. In fact, 
work demanded it. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go out for an hour lunch and I'd come back to work and find myself 
reading the same paragraph three times trying to figure out what it meant," 
said Lucking. "Bodysurfing changed that. Spending lunch in the water, I came 
back sharp and alert." 
</P>
<P>
Lucking scoffs at the idea of serving as an example to younger surfers, but, 
like it or not, there are plenty of young whippersnappers who emulate him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's neat to see that there's somebody older than you that's still doing it. 
It gives you the faith to hang in there," said Warren Glaser, an avid surfer 
who, at 53, still isn't old enough to escape an occasional lecture from his 
mother, who reckons he's far too old for this. 
</P>
<P>
"Yep, still nags me," said Glaser. " 'Adults don't do things like this,' 'It's 
not proper for your age,' things like that." 
</P>
<P>
Glaser, who started bodysurfing at age 12 and picked up board surfing as a 
16-year-old Ventura lifeguard, reckons that older watermen may be up against a 
force even more relentless than Mom. 
</P>
<P>
"Blood plasma and salt water have almost the same chemical composition and I 
think that's the way it is for a lot of the older generation," said Glaser. "It 
just gets in your blood and you just can't get it out. There's no sense 
trying." 
</P>
<P>
So they don't. Glaser figures he'll surf until he dies and says that, if he has 
a choice, "I hope I go that way." Lucking, Cantrell and Atwater aren't placing 
any limits on their surfing careers either. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take it one year at a time," said Cantrell. "Now my goal is to surf until 
I'm 62.

OXNARD OFFERS ALTERNATE CSU CAMPUS SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what may well be a futile effort, Oxnard this week suggested alternative 
sites for a California State University campus in case the Taylor Ranch site in 
Ventura falls through. 
</P>
<P>
However, CSU officials said they are serious about an ultimatum Chancellor W. 
Ann Reynolds delivered to county leaders almost two weeks ago, decreeing that 
Ventura County must accept a campus at Taylor Ranch or forgo a four-year 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we made it pretty clear that we believed we had looked at all the good 
alternatives and spent three years on the process," said Vice Chancellor Jack 
Smart. "We are not eager to look at another piece of property and take three 
years and not get it." 
</P>
<P>
Smart, however, refused to rule out the possibility of looking at other sites, 
but said the probability of the university doing so is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said she wanted to see an outpouring of community support for the 
coastal bluff by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
But the Oxnard City Council, saying a four-year university was vitally needed 
in Ventura County, suggested two sites in case Taylor Ranch is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
"A four-year college is needed so desperately in this county, the site should 
be second in everybody's mind," council member Ann Johs said. "It is the 
education we are looking at -- not the Taj Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard put six sites up for review three years ago. All were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
However, the point might be moot. 
</P>
<P>
Since Reynolds' ultimatum, CSU officials have heard from supporters throughout 
the county, and some school boards have endorsed Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, several groups have organized to raise money for a professional 
public relations campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it looks encouraging," Smart said. "A number of groups and individuals 
are expressing real interest in continuing to secure Taylor Ranch, and I think 
that's positive." 
</P>
<P>
The university chose Taylor Ranch after what Reynolds described as an 
"exhaustive" search of sites in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
But several groups have opposed building the university because of concerns 
about water and air pollution and increased traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Most notable in the opposition is the Ventura County Environmental Coalition, 
which recently asked four cities to suggest alternative sites for a campus. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition targeted Oxnard, Ventura, Camarillo and Santa Paula as optimal 
areas for a university. 
</P>
<P>
"The Environmental Coalition has worked very hard at not allowing the 
development of Taylor Ranch and at finding an alternative site," coalition 
representative Russ Baggerly told the Oxnard City Council Tuesday. "If you want 
to see a university in Ventura County, now is the time to act." 
</P>
<P>
The council then suggested two alternative sites. One site lies immediately 
south of U.S. Highway 101 between Del Norte Boulevard and Rice Avenue. The 
other is located in the Ormond Beach region. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not going to be Taylor Ranch, I certainly would want it to come to 
Oxnard," council member Dorothy Maron said. 
</P>
<P>
Sites in Oxnard offer advantages over Taylor Ranch because they are more easily 
accessible and pose fewer environmental concerns, said council member Manuel 
Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura City Council does not plan to suggest alternative sites because of 
Reynolds' decree that only Taylor Ranch will be considered, said City Manager 
John Baker. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been told there's no alternative, and if that's the case, why go 
through the drill again?," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council proposed several sites that have been rejected over the years, but 
ultimately went on record supporting Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
But November's election brought in three council members who oppose the site on 
environmental grounds and might attempt to block its construction. 
</P>
<P>
However, the council has not passed a resolution opposing the site and, 
according to Baker, continues to support it. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula, which did not take part in the original bidding for a campus, has 
yet to consider putting parcels forward for consideration, council member Carl 
Barringer said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Camarillo reiterated last month that it had two or three possible 
sites that were rejected by the university three years ago because they do not 
have ocean views, council member Sandi Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so frustrating to come so far and have nothing accomplished," Bush said.

ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: O'BYRNE, WESTLAKE GIRLS CLIMB TO THE TOP TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
At the Simi Valley tournament last month, the Westlake High girls' basketball 
team advanced to the final, the first time the Warriors had ever played for a 
tournament title. The experience was like climbing one rung from the top of a 
ladder, looking down, and feeling too dizzy to take the last step. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake fell to Buena, a seasoned team well-accustomed to lofty perches and 
tournament championships. 
</P>
<P>
At the Thousand Oaks tournament last week, Westlake again made it to the final. 
This time the last step was taken confidently as the Warriors defeated 
Palmdale, 62-41, for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Directing the Warriors as ballhandler, floor leader and top scorer was Dani 
O'Byrne, a junior off-guard who is in her third year as a starter. O'Byrne had 
21 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals against Palmdale, a 
performance that has become typical for her. 
</P>
<P>
In four Thousand Oaks tournament games she had 85 points, 21 rebounds, 18 
assists and seven steals. 
</P>
<P>
"Dani does a little bit of everything," said Coach Nancy Bowman, whose team is 
11-1. "She has a nice-looking outside shot, an excellent pull-up jumper and she 
drives to the basket well. She has great body and ball control." 
</P>
<P>
O'Byrne, who averages a team-leading 15.8 points a game, is also unselfish. 
Three of her teammates also average in double-figures in scoring and often 
their baskets are preceded by a crisp pass from O'Byrne. 
</P>
<P>
"Although her statistics aren't overwhelming, I think Dani is the best guard in 
the Marmonte League," said Bowman, fully aware that the competition for that 
claim includes Camarillo's Nichole Victoria and Thousand Oaks' Michelle 
Palmisano. "Dani can do more things than the others. But she is surrounded by 
better players this year and doesn't have to do it all." 
</P>
<P>
Just enough to get Westlake to the top rung of the ladder.

OPPONENTS FIND BUENA TEAM UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED

<P>
Buena Coach Glen Hannah thought he was supervising a high school dance, not a 
basketball team. The Bulldogs, who scored more than 100 points in each of their 
first three games, suddenly had stopped running their fastbreak. 
</P>
<P>
They were standing around on the floor, each waiting for a teammate to take the 
first step, according to Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
"We hit a slump for 2 1/2 games," Hannah said. "We weren't playing hard. We 
looked for other people to do things instead of doing them ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Hannah held a team meeting. Team captain Jeff Oliver called a players-only 
meeting the day after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
And after the meetings, Buena held a basketball seminar last week in the 
Ventura/Kiwanis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs beat Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Oxnard to win their first 
tournament title of the season, and Oliver was named most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we played a lot harder," Hannah said. "We were more consistent 
throughout the game. We didn't hit so many peaks and valleys." 
</P>
<P>
No matter the pace, Buena was able to keep up with its opponents, Hannah 
discovered. Buena and Thousand Oaks combined for a tournament-record 193 points 
as the Bulldogs won, 102-91. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer a fast-paced game with lots of fast breaks," Hannah said. "But I 
think we also proved we can be patient against deliberate offenses." 
</P>
<P>
Bad break: Sophomore Jeff Wright wanted an opportunity to play with his older 
brother, Ryan, on the St. Bonaventure varsity and got his break when senior 
Kevin Zoll suffered a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, however, injured his hand during a junior varsity game the day before 
his promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Diving for a loose ball, Wright sustained a fractured bone in the middle finger 
of his right (shooting) hand. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who was promoted because of his scoring ability, was hampered by the 
splint on his finger and averaged only 3.3 points in three games at the 
Carpinteria tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Seraphs (4-5) have lost three straight since Zoll, a three-year starter, 
suffered a torn ligament in his left knee. Zoll is averaging 12 points and four 
assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bonaventure's last win was over Santa Paula, 58-35, on Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't find anyone to pick up the slack for Zoll in terms of points, 
ballhandling and court leadership," St. Bonaventure Coach Marc Groff said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to collectively make up the difference and it's not working." 
</P>
<P>
Groff believes senior off-guard Marvin Sagles (11 points a game) could prove to 
be the solution to the scoring problem. 
</P>
<P>
Streak stoppers: Nordhoff holds the distinction of being the last team to beat 
Santa Clara in a Frontier League game. The Rangers beat the Saints, 59-53, in 
the 1984 league finale to sweep their two-game series and win the title. 
</P>
<P>
Since that loss, the Saints have won 34 consecutive league games and four 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
The teams meet in a Frontier League opener Friday at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff might not have anyone to match the talents of Division I prospect Shon 
Tarver, but it does have an outstanding sophomore. Tim Sebek, the son of Coach 
Dick Sebek, leads the team in scoring (14.1 points a game), rebounding (8.6) 
and assists (5.8). 
</P>
<P>
Sebek could become the first player in school history to start all four years 
for the Rangers (6-5). 
</P>
<P>
Not ready for prime time: As his team' tallest and most talented player, 6-5 
senior center Mike Spears has been cast in a prominent role for Hueneme. But 
Spears has had trouble adjusting after a year as a role player. 
</P>
<P>
"Spears is a stud," Hueneme Coach Howard Davis said. "He has the potential to 
be a great player. 
</P>
<P>
"But what he can do in practice, he can't do in a game. He doesn't know how to 
dominate a game." 
</P>
<P>
Spears has been averaging 15.5 points a game, but Hueneme has struggled to a 
3-7 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Spears needs to increase his average if the Vikings are to be 
successful in the Channel League.

SANTA PAULA SOCCER TEAM RELYING ON HARD WORK IN ITS QUEST FOR A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT BUTWELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Players from the Santa Paula High soccer team approached Coach Joe Magdaleno 
before the season with a special request. 
</P>
<P>
The players weren't seeking new uniforms, fancy sweat suits or soccer balls. 
Indeed, some coaches might be shocked by what the team asked for: A kick in the 
butt. 
</P>
<P>
"Each player said, 'Joe, we want you to work the team real hard and get us back 
to where we were two years ago,' " Magdaleno recalled last week. 
</P>
<P>
So far, it's working. The Cardinals are 5-2 against a tough lineup of nonleague 
opponents and begin their Frontier League schedule Friday at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula won the Southern Section 1-A Division championship in 1987, but 
lost in the quarterfinals to Hemet, 3-2, last year. The Cardinals' reaction to 
the loss shows why they are traditionally one of the top teams in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"The soccer team has a reputation in town and we take a lot of pride in Santa 
Paula of soccer," forward Dustin Magdaleno, the coach's son, said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the elder Magdaleno started the program in 1980, Santa Paula has won five 
league titles and has missed the playoffs only once. Four times it has reached 
the semifinal round before losing. 
</P>
<P>
"The things I stress more than winning are pride, discipline and respect," 
Magdaleno said. "If you have that, you can accomplish anything in life." 
</P>
<P>
Magdaleno has only one team rule: No swearing. A few bad words, and a player 
can find himself off the team. 
</P>
<P>
"If a player gets to a point where he's swearing at an opponent or referee, 
he's not going to be successful." Magdaleno says he never cuts anyone who tries 
out for the team, and he tries to play as many players as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as a player is willing to practice hard, he is on the team," Magdaleno 
said. "And if we get up by three goals by halftime, I try to let everybody 
play." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals also benefit greatly from the Hispanic heritage of Santa Paula, a 
city where 60 percent of the population is Latino. Soccer is the national 
pastime in Spain and most of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my players grew up with a soccer ball and learned from their dads, 
uncles and brothers," Magdaleno said. "By the time they get to high school, 
some of them are showing me tricks." 
</P>
<P>
Dustin Magdaleno, Carlos Elizarraraz and Juan Carlos Rodriguez, among others, 
compete in a local summer league against older players, many of whom work as 
field hands during the week. 
</P>
<P>
Many players come back to practices after graduation from high school and 
scrimmage against the current team. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Magdaleno and Elizarraraz, the team captains, tell their teammates 
about the 1987 championship team, on which they played as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep telling us how great winning the championship felt and how hard they 
worked," fullback Jamie Johnson said. "It gets us pumped up." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson went out for the cross-country team -- which is also coached by 
Magdaleno -- last spring to be in better shape for soccer. Magdaleno said the 
work ethic of his players stems from the fact that many worked in the area's 
orange, lemon and avocado groves -- work that makes the discipline of soccer 
seem easy by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids that come out for soccer have grown up where they have to work for 
everything they want," he said. 
</P>

OLD-FASHIONED WAY: The soccer team at Santa Paula High delivered an unusual 
request to Coach Joe Magdaleno recently -- the players asked him to work them 
hard. They said that is the only way to win a Southern Section title.

VENTURA BANK OPENS TRADING ON NASDAQ; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: VENTURA COUNTY NATIONAL BANCORP IS EXPANDING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, BUT 
IT FACES THE THREAT OF BEING BOUGHT IN THE 1990S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the opening of the stock market on Tuesday, shares of Ventura County 
National Bancorp started trading on the NASDAQ National Market System -- the 
big leagues of over-the-counter market governed by the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, VCNB, whose main unit is Oxnard-based Ventura County National Bank, 
had been a "pink-sheet" stock that was thinly traded and virtually ignored by 
analysts. By moving to the National Market System, the stock's visibility among 
investors improves greatly. 
</P>
<P>
For William E. McAleer, president of the holding company and chairman of its 
bank, the new listing also could help his expansion plans for VCNB. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB, which caters mostly to local, mid-size businesses with annual sales of $1 
million to $50 million, has grown to $243 million in assets since it was 
founded by 11 local business people in 1982. VCNB is still a pipsqueak, but 
McAleer expects his bank to keep growing -- with its assets hitting $450 
million or $500 million by late 1990 -- in part by buying other banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plan is to add another acquisition, or at least be able to announce one, 
before the middle of next year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking with four banks now," he added, declining to identify the 
potential partners. 
</P>
<P>
Once VCNB finds a bank to buy, it might want to purchase it with its stock 
rather than cash. In that case, having its stock on the National Market System, 
where many more investors are available to buy or sell the shares compared with 
the pink-sheet market, could make VCNB's offer more palatable to the target 
bank's sellers. 
</P>
<P>
For all of McAleer's growth plans, the likelihood is that, in the 1990s, VCNB 
will be bought. Beginning in 1991, East Coast banks will be allowed to buy 
California banks. In other areas of the nation where interstate banking has 
been introduced, tiny yet well-run banks like VCNB have been gobbled up. Of 
course, the bigger VCNB gets, the more likely its stockholders are to profit if 
the bank is acquired. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sell, because I need a job," McAleer said, adding that he 
hopes to keep VCNB independent. But the total value of VCNB's stock today is 
about $44 million, and VCNB's management would be hard-pressed to fend off any 
viable offer. 
</P>
<P>
McAleer -- who earned $185,000 in salary and bonuses in 1988 -- owns less than 
1% of VCNB's stock, and none of the bank's officers own more than 5%. Together, 
however, the officers and VCNB's employee stock ownership plan own about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Even if it is not bought right away, VCNB must grow to survive in the early 
1990s after banks from the East Coast and elsewhere set up shop here. "It's 
going to take that critical size in order . . . to compete," McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB already has bought two other business banks: Conejo Valley National Bank, 
based in Thousand Oaks, which VCNB bought in exchange for its stock in late 
1986; and Frontier Group, owner of the one-office Frontier Bank in La Palma, 
which VCNB bought for $8 million in mid-1989. The Frontier deal gave VCNB a 
beachhead in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But McAleer's sights are broader. "We have 19 areas within Southern California 
that we consider the areas of intense commercial-industrial growth," he said. 
Among them are the National City-San Ysidro and El Cajon areas near San Diego, 
and the Fontana-Upland region east of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees with McAleer's approach, including Marshall C. Milligan, 
president of Levy Bancorp, the Ventura-based parent of the Bank of A. Levy and 
VCNB's neighborhood rival. Milligan's bank, which serves consumer and business, 
is twice VCNB's size, with $582 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
"In contrast to VCNB, I don't believe in growth for growth's sake," Milligan 
said. "I frankly don't understand that strategy, and I don't understand the 
strategy of buying a bank in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
McAleer said he bought Frontier, which kept its name, for a simple reason: "We 
could immediately make more money with it." Frontier is a small bank ($70 
million in assets) that had loaned out 52% of its deposits, compared to 85% at 
VCNB. Under VCNB's guidance, Frontier quickly put an additional $13 million of 
loans on its books and raised its pretax profit by $500,000, McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
Frontier also gives VCNB entrance into the huge Orange County commercial 
market, he said, dismissing suggestions that Orange County already has plenty 
of hometown business banks. "None of them are large," that is, with assets 
above $500 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether McAleer can repeat that success in other parts of Southern California 
remains to be seen, but VCNB generally has maintained strong profits while it 
has grown. 
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of 1989, VCNB earned $2.1 million -- equal to its 
profit for all of 1988 -- and its return on average assets, or ROA, in the nine 
months and in 1988 were 1.22% and 1.10%, respectively, well above the 1% 
reading that is considered an excellent performance. An ROA shows how 
profitably a bank uses assets at its disposal. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB's only down year came in 1986, when its earnings plunged to $225,000 from 
$1.3 million the previous year. The drop reflected costs associated with VCNB's 
purchase of Conejo Valley National Bank. One of Conejo Valley's subsidiaries 
was saddled with problem loans, McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
VCNB's stock price has advanced with its earnings growth. After going public at 
$10 a share in 1982, the stock now sells for the equivalent of $43.75 a share, 
if subsequent stock splits and stock dividends were excluded. (Adjusted for 
those items, the stock now trades at about $10 a share.) 
</P>
<P>
McAleer, a Los Angeles native, worked for Security Pacific, Barclay's and 
Orange County Bank in Southern California. He moved to Oklahoma in 1979 and 
held executive positions at two banks in the Tulsa area. He left Oklahoma just 
as the state's energy woes were about to make trouble for many banks there, and 
in 1982 got the job as VCNB's first president after seeing the bank's 
help-wanted ad in a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
McAleer still has a way to go just to impress hometown rival, Levy Bancorp's 
Milligan. "They haven't taken a big chunk of our business," Milligan said. 
"They've been more effective at creating that image, but I don't think that 
actually translates into volume of business. We do a lot more business banking 
in the county than they do." 
</P>
<P>
But one thing Milligan can't dismiss: In seven years, VCNB has become half as 
large as Levy, which was founded 100 years earlier.

RAIDERS OFFERED $60 MILLION, NEW STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Raiders would get a new Coliseum to play in, an immediate 
payment of more than $20 million and the promise of an additional $40 million 
over 10 years if owner Al Davis keeps his team in Los Angeles, under terms of 
an agreement currently in negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
Sources on both sides of the talks, who described the proposed deal, said 
chances that the team will stay in Los Angeles, rather than move to Oakland or 
Sacramento, seem to have improved in recent weeks. But serious legal obstacles 
and other impediments could block the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
For more than two years, the Raiders ultimate home has been up in the air, with 
first Irwindale, and later Sacramento and Oakland, in the bidding. There has 
been a steady inflation in the value of bids to Davis, but questions have 
arisen at each site on the ability to perform on the promises. 
</P>
<P>
According to one source, Davis agreed at a meeting Wednesday not to go ahead 
with a team move to either Oakland or Sacramento while developers from the 
Spectacor Management Group and MCA Inc., the private managers of the Coliseum, 
seek approval from the Coliseum Commission for a private ground lease that 
would allow the project to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, the source said, Davis successfully pushed for a bigger 
cash payment to the team, but how much bigger than $20 million was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal goes through, the Raiders would receive the largest fee ever paid 
to a professional team for staying where it is. Sources described the payment 
as settlement of the Coliseum Commission's pending lawsuit against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
Davis has not commented publicly on the discussions. But he said in a 
television interview Dec. 24 that he wants an "intimate" stadium for the 
Raiders, one with a low-enough seating capacity to escape television blackouts 
and with good, close-in sight lines for fans. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Coliseum in Los Angeles nor the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum has such 
sight lines now. 
</P>
<P>
All sources close to the negotiations -- citing the delicate nature of the 
talks -- spoke to The Times on condition that they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Initial Payment 
</P>
<P>
The sources said that much of the initial payment to Davis would come from the 
$20 million the Coliseum Commission collected in damages from the National 
Football League in the lawsuit against the league for impeding the Raiders' 
move from Oakland in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In order to provide Davis with a tax-free grant, the money would be given to 
him in "settlement" of a $57-million lawsuit the Coliseum has filed against the 
Raiders for alleged breach of contract, sources said. Legal settlements are not 
taxable. 
</P>
<P>
But the money would later be reimbursed, with interest, to the Coliseum 
Commission by the private developers, the sources said. They insisted that only 
private money would ultimately be used and expressed confidence that bank 
financing could quickly be obtained by Spectacor, the prime mover in the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Davis reportedly stated firmly at Wednesday's meeting that he is not bound by 
the terms of the deal, as it is currently described, even if the Coliseum 
Commission should approve the concept. This was an indication that, just as he 
did in Sacramento and Oakland, the Raiders' owner would press for better terms 
than he is being offered. 
</P>
<P>
One possible Davis move, a source said, would be to demand from the private 
developers a non-returnable advance payment, while they see if the project can 
be put together. Such a demand would be similar to the $10 million Irwindale 
gave the Raiders as earnest money in 1987, when the team said it would move 
there if a new stadium could be built. That money apparently will not be 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
Two sources told The Times that Davis gave assurances Wednesday that he would 
not require such an advance payment, which might compound the political 
difficulties of getting the project approved. But another source said he might 
yet do so. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan, who has 
participated in some of the discussions, said later Wednesday the odds have 
increased that the Raiders can be persuaded not to leave Los Angeles. Riordan 
said that he hopes to come to an agreement before he gives up the commission 
presidency to attorney Matthew Grossman next month. 
</P>
<P>
Lease Proposed 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed deal, the Coliseum Commission would give a ground lease, 
perhaps for as long as 30 years, to the private developers. The 92,000-seat 
Coliseum, the only stadium in the world that has hosted two modern Olympics, 
would be demolished, except for the eastern peristyle end. A new $125-million 
stadium, seating about 65,000 people, would be constructed in its place. 
</P>
<P>
This stadium would include 200 luxury boxes and 3,000 club seats that promoters 
expect could be marketed to corporate interests and wealthy individuals for 
millions of dollars a year. The stadium would also be expandable to more than 
80,000 seats for selected games, such as a Super Bowl or the USC-UCLA or 
USC-Notre Dame football games. 
</P>
<P>
According to Spectacor and MCA executives, the Raiders and USC might play at 
the Rose Bowl -- or, as a fallback, Anaheim Stadium -- during the year or two 
of Coliseum reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
The promoters have even speculated in conversations with Davis that UCLA could 
not resist returning to a new Coliseum from the Rose Bowl, where they play 
under an agreement scheduled to expire in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
Inquiries made in the last two days, however, showed that UCLA officials are 
cool to any idea that they might quit the Rose Bowl, where their attendance has 
been better than it was in the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Both Rose Bowl and Anaheim Stadium officials said no one has approached them 
about the Raiders and USC playing in their stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim authorities appeared receptive to the idea of the Raiders and USC 
playing in Anaheim Stadium, although they cautioned that there could be 
scheduling conflicts with the Rams and the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Shortage of Dates 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Deputy City Manager Edward Aghjayan said a city policy, changeable 
only by a vote of the city's governing body, states that only 12 major events 
can take place in the Rose Bowl each year, and UCLA already has six. Under this 
policy, there are not enough open dates for the Raiders, much less USC. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Tournament of Roses committee, under a lease, has total 
control of the Rose Bowl in the month preceding the Rose Bowl game. December is 
an extremely important month for professional football games. 
</P>
<P>
Other inquiries raise these potential obstacles to the kind of project private 
developers are talking about with Davis: 
</P>
<P>
* The Coliseum Commission has a ground lease for the Coliseum from the Museum 
of Science and Industry, the state body that owns the site, which extends only 
to 2005. Because banks would probably require a longer deal to insure repayment 
of loans to finance the project, the lease would have to be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers privy to the negotiations said no one has begun to look into this 
problem. According to the 1955 ground lease, the Coliseum Commission has an 
option to extend its lease in 2003 for 49 years but may do so only if it agrees 
with the museum board on what the rent should be. If there is a disagreement, 
then the rent would be increased from the current $50,000 a year in proportion 
to increases in Los Angeles County's total assessed valuation between 1955 and 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
All of this would be subject to negotiation, and the museum board has for a 
long time been leery of Coliseum-area redevelopment and might not prove a 
willing bargainer. 
</P>
<P>
* The Coliseum is both a state and a national historic landmark -- not just the 
peristyle end but the whole facility. Never before, according to a state 
historian contacted Wednesday, has a national historic landmark been 
demolished, and an elaborate and time-consuming procedure is required before 
state agencies rule on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Maryln Lortie, historian in the registration section of the state Office of 
Historic Preservation, said the state code would require would-be Coliseum 
redevelopers to seek permission from state agencies to alter the facility in 
any substantive way. 
</P>
<P>
Disputes over what to do are ultimately reviewed by the state Office of 
Planning and Research. Only one project to alter a historic landmark has ever 
reached that level, and that proposal was finally scrapped, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Ray Girvigian, chairman of the state Historic Building Code Board who 
was instrumental in getting the Coliseum designated a state and national 
landmark in 1984, said Wednesday, "I would look with great dismay on any 
proposal to destroy possibly the most significant landmark of its type, not 
only in California, but in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
* There are also major questions, lawyers said, about the charter under which 
the Coliseum is administered by a tripartite body, with three commissioners 
representing the city, the county and the state. Terms might well have to be 
renegotiated, a lengthy procedure that could require legislative approval. 
</P>
<P>
* An environmental impact report would be required before a project could 
proceed. In Irwindale, the environmental studies alone took more than a year.

The KGB security police rushed reinforcements to the Iranian border Wednesday 
to stop rampaging Soviet Azerbaijanis from forcing open the frontier by 
demolishing guard towers and security alarms, official media reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government daily Izvestia said that after three days, the 
disturbances had spread along Azerbaijan's nearly 500-mile-long border with 
Iran. One protester was reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the Azerbaijanis want their Soviet republic united with a 
region peopled by their ethnic kin in northern Iran, and they have threatened 
to remove all border barriers unless authorities do so. 
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijani activists, however, say they merely want an open border and the 
freedom to trade and cross the frontier, practices suspended four decades ago 
by Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest in the Soviet Caucasus adds to the ethnic headaches already facing 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as his reforms unleash long pent-up grievances 
of the country's many nationalities. The Caucasus has already been torn for two 
years by strife among Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Abkhazians and other 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest on the Soviet-Iranian frontier introduced a new international 
element with political and religious overtones. The dispatch of reinforcements, 
as reported by Izvestia, made clear that detachments of KGB border troops 
regularly stationed along the border were incapable of quashing the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The official news agency Tass said that about 7,500 protesters destroyed guard 
towers, electronic alarm equipment and communications lines along the border 
when the unrest began Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia, quoting I. Petrovas, chief of the KGB's Caucasus border district, 
reported that the "illegal actions" continued Wednesday but gave no details of 
the latest trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Practically along the entire border between Azerbaijan and Iran a complex 
situation has emerged," Izvestia said in a report headlined "Pogrom on the 
Soviet-Iranian Border." 
</P>
<P>
The report said the turmoil had spread from the Azerbaijani enclave of 
Nakhichevan, located between Armenia and Iran, to the regions of Zangelansk and 
Pushkinsk and the Caspian Sea port of Lenkoran in Azerbaijan itself. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Nikolai Britvin, head of the political department of the KGB's special 
border guard units, told Tass, however, that the incidents lasted only through 
Tuesday and that the situation was "gradually returning to normal." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said additional border guards were being sent in with armored 
personnel carriers. Neither he nor Izvestia said how many guards were normally 
stationed along the Soviet-Iranian border or how many reinforcements were sent. 
</P>
<P>
The reports in state-run Soviet media said that the protesters, led by the 
grass-roots political group Azerbaijan People's Front, had been threatening for 
weeks to go on a rampage and refused to accept concessions by officials. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting Britvin, Tass said one person was killed in a clash among the 
protesters but did not say when or how many may also have been injured. Border 
guards did not use their weapons and none was hurt despite threats against 
them, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Izvestia said some protesters were armed with pistols and hunting rifles and 
estimated that they did more than $8.2 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
In the first Soviet media report Tuesday on the border rampage, Tass said some 
protesters were drunk or high on narcotics. Those claims, vigorously denied by 
Azerbaijan People's Front officials, were not repeated on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds of the unrest were sown Dec. 4 when a crowd of Soviet Azerbaijanis 
gathered at the border with loudspeakers and called on their Iranian neighbors, 
both members of the same ethnic group and predominantly Shiite Muslims, to 
unify their regions, Izvestia reported. 
</P>
<P>
About 4 million ethnic Azerbaijanis live in the adjoining Iranian province of 
Azerbaijan, where Stalin briefly set up a puppet state during World War II 
before being forced by Western powers to withdraw in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Azerbaijanis have been camped along the border for nearly a month in 
hopes of seeing relatives and friends on the other side, a People's Front 
member said. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 12, Azerbaijani protesters warned border guards they would destroy 
barriers at the border unless they were removed by Dec. 31, according to 
Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities agreed to ease travel restrictions, move some border posts and 
improve "conditions for economic activity" in the region, Tass said. But it 
said protesters declared a "Frontier Week" from Jan. 1-7 and vowed to destroy 
border structures.

PAPAL OFFICIALS PAINTED DISMAL FATE FOR NORIEGA

<TEXT>
<P>
The surrender of Manuel A. Noriega was accomplished by extreme diplomatic 
pressures from Vatican representatives, who even told Noriega they might move 
their embassy and leave him alone in the compound surrounded by U.S. soldiers 
and an angry populace, according to sources in Panama and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Papal Nuncio Jose Sebastian Laboa "painted a very dismal picture" for Noriega, 
a Western European diplomat said shortly after Noriega's surrender was 
announced Wednesday night. "They would have moved the embassy, pulled down the 
flag and left him there" to face his fate alone, the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's diplomatic immunity would have ended if the nunciature were declared 
to be relocated. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official echoed that version of events, although he 
said the relocation of the embassy was presented to Noriega as only one option 
being considered by the Vatican to end the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
The State Department official said he would not characterize the message to 
Noriega as a threat but as a clear indication of the Vatican's determination to 
force him out of the embassy. "The whole purpose was to make him realize that 
he was isolated," the official said. "Everyone had to convince him that his 
only option was to surrender, that it was over." 
</P>
<P>
He described the negotiations as a "process of elimination" of Noriega's 
options, with the clear message being that "everyone wanted him to get out." 
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said he spoke directly with Laboa after the papal ambassador 
accompanied Noriega to the gates of the nunciature, as the Vatican compound is 
known. 
</P>
<P>
"The nuncio explained to Noriega that he had no other choice," the diplomat 
said. "If he had stayed in Panama (for trial), he would have been lynched by a 
mob. If he had been allowed to go to a third country, he would have faced 
Somoza's future." He referred to former Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, 
who was assassinated in exile in Paraguay in 1980, the year after he was 
overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
"Laboa is a very convincing person," the diplomat said, adding, "The only place 
that could guarantee Noriega's safety was the United States. He can always hope 
for a mistrial." 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Archbishop Marcos McGrath said the turning point came when the 
nuncio made it "quite clear" to Noriega that he was not welcome in the Vatican 
embassy indefinitely, and that because he was not going to be considered a 
political refugee, the Vatican would not help him seek sanctuary in a third 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian Vice President Guillermo (Billy) Ford said the nuncio "was able to 
convince Noriega to leave the nunciature and face justice, and he decided to 
face U.S. justice." Ford suggested that the Panama government would try to 
prosecute Noriega once U.S. courts are through with him -- a process that could 
take years. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll seek him later," Ford declared Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Other Administration officials said the U.S. agreed on several terms of 
surrender for Noriega: that he be able to make a few phone calls and be 
permitted to wear his uniform, and that his surrender be kept secret until the 
moment he walked out of the nunciature. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Administration promised Noriega he would not be tried on a federal 
drug-kingpin statute that carries the death penalty, the sources said.

<P>
Former Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega was handed over to U.S. 
authorities in Panama on Wednesday night to face drug charges in American 
courts, the White House announced. The circumstances of the surrender were not 
immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega had sought refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama City on Christmas 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in a nationally televised appearance from the White House, said 
that Noriega "turned himself in to U.S. authorities with the full knowledge" of 
the new Panamanian government. 
</P>
<P>
The President said that Noriega was taken to Howard Air Force Base in Panama, 
where he was arrested by agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration, and 
that he was on his way to Homestead Air Force Base in southern Florida aboard a 
U.S. Air Force C-130 transport plane. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that Noriega left the Vatican embassy about 8:50 p.m. Less than an 
hour elapsed before the former dictator was on his way to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"He left of his own will. . . . The decision was his and his alone," Gen. 
Maxwell Thurman, commander of the U.S. Southern command in Panama City, said at 
a news conference. Noriega was indicted in February, 1988, on drug-trafficking 
and money-laundering charges by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
The President pledged that Noriega would be given a "fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
Bush added that Noriega's "apprehension and return to the United States should 
send a clear signal that the United States is serious in its determination that 
these charges" will be tried in a court of law. 
</P>
<P>
The President said that he had launched the invasion of Panama on Dec. 20 with 
four goals: to save American lives, to restore democracy in Panama, to protect 
the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties, which will turn the canal over to 
the new government of Panama in 10 years, and to remove Noriega from office. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these objectives have now been achieved," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
The invasion was carried out by nearly 14,000 U.S. troops. Twenty-three 
American soldiers were killed and more than 300 wounded in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
As of Wednesday, about 1,000 troops had been withdrawn, and the President 
promised that more would be pulled out as soon as the "local situation would 
permit." 
</P>
<P>
Before Noriega's surrender, the largest public demonstration in 2 1/2 years 
formed near the Vatican embassy in Panama City to excoriate Noriega and urge 
the Vatican to force the one-time "maximum leader" out into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The polite and well-groomed crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 people was stopped by a 
newly installed chain-link fence erected by the American troops who surrounded 
the mission. The crowd was kept three blocks from the embassy by American 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
Although demonstration leaders urged cheers and chants over loudspeakers, most 
of the crowd stood quietly by, drinking sodas, eating ice cream and enjoying 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
The most eloquent and creative symbols of the demonstrators' sentiments were 
expressed on the T-shirts many wore. "No More, the Nightmare Is Over," read the 
message on many. 
</P>
<P>
A second message read: "Just Force (the code name for the invasion), Not an 
Invasion, Just Welcome." And another message read: "Thank U Salvation Army." 
</P>
<P>
As the well-behaved and widely spaced demonstrators milled in front of the 
12-foot-tall fence, about 30 U.S. soldiers in full combat gear and carrying 
M-16 assault rifles patrolled a few feet away. However, the tanks that normally 
block the streets near the Vatican embassy had been pulled back a block. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday in Panama City, Col. Roberto Armijo, the officer chosen to 
head a new Panamanian military cleansed of the corruption and brutality that 
identified the army headed by Noriega, was forced to resign because of 
"irregularities in his personal finances." 
</P>
<P>
President Guillermo Endara made the announcement of Armijo's resignation, which 
marks his new government's first crisis, without elaboration. But Vice 
President Ricardo Arias Calderon said in an interview that Armijo, the 
highest-ranking officer kept on after the Dec. 20 American invasion, quit 
because an investigation found signs of serious personal corruption during his 
nearly 25 years in the Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Armijo had been appointed commander of the newly named and drastically reduced 
Public Force because he was the highest-ranking officer left after the U.S. 
military and Endara government officials had culled out leaders of the old 
Defense Forces thought guilty of corruption, brutality, torture and other 
serious crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The choice came under private but immediate fire from anti-Noriega leaders, 
both in and out of the new government, because of charges that no one who held 
such high positions as Armijo's -- he headed the national police, the navy and 
was chief of military personnel -- could have avoided corruption. 
</P>
<P>
This criticism, along with growing dissatisfaction with the government's 
apparent willingness to incorporate other officers and enlisted men of the PDF 
into the new military structure, led to an investigation of Armijo, according 
to presidential spokesman Anel Beliz. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Arias, who is in charge of restructuring the military, said the 
investigation "found questions about Armijo's personal finances. We called him 
on the telephone and said we wanted to discuss his personal finances. He then 
offered to resign." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources said the colonel, who was due to retire next summer, was given no 
choice. Beliz said the question of criminal charges against Armijo is still 
under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The undisclosed amount of money that investigators traced to Armijo indicates 
serious corruption, according to several government officials. They charged 
that Armijo was involved in smuggling and extortion, for which he allegedly 
received large payments. 
</P>
<P>
Arias said in the interview that his program for the new military was not 
involved in the decision to fire the army commander, insisting that "there is 
no difference in the government over the development of the security force. 
Personal finances -- this is the reason, and the only reason, for the 
resignation." 
</P>
<P>
However, other senior members of the government and influential leaders of the 
three main parties that make up the coalition headed by Endara said the 
appointment and subsequent disgrace of Armijo are representative of the flaws 
in Arias' approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot use either the structure or the members of the PDF to form the new 
security force," said one government Cabinet member, who asked for anonymity. 
"All we need is a small police force." 
</P>
<P>
Arias plans to rebuild the military to some 8,000 troops and will include 
counterintelligence, combat and other units normally found in a traditional 
army. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Armijo's removal satisfied some critics, particularly those who 
said the police he once commanded had brutally attacked peaceful opposition 
groups, his appointed successor is also the subject of serious doubts.

<P>
Endara said the new army will be headed by Col. Eduardo Herrera Hassan, a 
controversial officer who was in and out of Noriega's favor over the years and 
who also is charged with brutality in leading security forces against former 
opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Herrera may be the favorite of the Americans," said a prominent banker who is 
a close adviser to the government, "but he was a product of, and member of, a 
military system that opposes democracy and sees corruption as its natural 
right." 
</P>
<P>
Herrera reportedly was a paid informant of the CIA, which diplomatic sources 
say overlooked both his once-close links to Noriega and Panama's one-time 
military strongman, Omar Torrijos, because he could be used both for 
information about Noriega and as a focus for fomenting discontent within the 
PDF. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview before the Armijo firing, Herrera denied any illegal activity 
and said that charges that his troops have brutalized political opponents were 
disinformation spread by Noriega to discredit him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Washington, Fitzwater said a report that Noriega might have been 
tipped off in advance of the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion "does not appear to be 
true." 
</P>
<P>
The report, which first appeared in Friday's editions of the Washington Times, 
suggested that Noriega might have had 48 hours warning of the U.S. action. 
</P>
<P>
However, Fitzwater said, "It seems unlikely there was a tip-off in view of all 
the accounts of his surprise -- that he was having dinner in a restaurant 
supposedly and drove all over town and so forth." 
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, a spokesman confirmed that Nicaragua has protested 
what it described as a second incursion by U.S. forces into the residences of 
Nicaraguan diplomats in Panama City. But he said Washington had been unable to 
determine if the charge is true. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration apologized earlier for the invasion by U.S. troops into the 
home of the Nicaraguan ambassador last week. President Bush called it "a 
screw-up." 
</P>
<P>
Speaker Thomas S. Foley announced that a House delegation will visit Panama 
today and Friday to investigate the military and political situation and report 
its findings promptly to him. 
</P>
<P>
Foley assigned House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri to head the 
bipartisan group of 30 House members, with GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia 
leading the Republican contingent.

STATE LAWMAKERS ANGERED BY POLL; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: LEGISLATORS THINK VOTERS ARE WRONG TO HOLD THEM IN LOW ESTEEM. BUT 
THEY SEEM RESIGNED TO THE FACT.

<P>
State legislators, returning to the Capitol after a two-month recess, reacted 
with both anger and acceptance Wednesday to a new state poll showing that most 
voters hold them in low esteem, believing they are unethical and unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's an awful shallow, cynical attitude about elected officials," Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) commented. "I don't think there's 
anything we can do to deal with that kind of lie -- and it's an absolute, 
unadulterated lie." 
</P>
<P>
Although legislators contended that they were getting a bum rap from the public 
-- with many politicians suffering for the sins of a few -- they also basically 
agreed that their image, indeed, is unseemly and needs serious polishing. 
</P>
<P>
Several politicians observed that the findings by The Times Poll pinpointed 
opportunities for statewide and legislative candidates to run for office this 
year against "the mess in Sacramento." 
</P>
<P>
"People are fed up and looking for some alternatives," said Paul Maslin, a 
veteran political pollster who now is a top adviser to state Atty. Gen. John K. 
Van de Kamp, a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. "People 
think the system doesn't work for them. It's an insiders' system, a vicious 
circle that just helps perpetuate itself -- the legislators, the wealthy 
contributors, the bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
Maslin naturally believes Van de Kamp will benefit politically from "this 
feeling of cynicism and disillusionment," which the pollster said has been 
showing up in his own surveys as well as The Times'. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who has called Sacramento a "swamp," is pushing a political reform 
ballot initiative that would impose term limits on elected state officials and 
provide for partial public financing of their races in exchange for ceilings on 
campaign spending. The Times Poll indicated that voters might be receptive to 
these ideas. 
</P>
<P>
The Times' findings that particularly irked legislators during their first day 
back on the job after a long vacation included those showing that most voters 
think it is commonplace for lawmakers to take bribes, that the overwhelmingly 
majority believe lawmakers "are for sale" to campaign contributors and that the 
electorate assumes all of state government "is pretty much run by a few big 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, beginning his final year in office, also was found to 
have only lukewarm support among voters, who had a hard time naming anything 
that either he or the Legislature had accomplished recently. The irony was that 
the governor and the Legislature had -- by almost any standard -- a very 
productive year in 1989, hammering out several major agreements. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Deukmejian nor any of his top aides would comment on the survey 
Wednesday. But many legislators talked freely of their frustration with trying 
to clean up an image that has been severely tarnished by continuing scandal, 
including a lingering FBI investigation into Capitol political corruption and a 
widely publicized trial of a state senator on charges of extorting bribes and 
laundering money. 
</P>
<P>
Typical was Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who 
recalled laboring half of last year against long odds to help enact legislation 
demanded by the public to ban semi-automatic assault rifles. "Your enemies 
remember and your friends forget," he lamented. "The public, six months after 
the fact, can't remember that the bill even passed. That's life in the big 
city, but that's not the fault of the Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
Roberti and several other politicians also theorized that state government is 
suffering from a public attitude of "a pox on all politicians," with voters not 
differentiating substantively between widely publicized scandals in Congress, 
the Legislature, Los Angeles City Hall and in savings and loan regulation. "It 
was a scandal-ridden year," noted pollster Maslin. 
</P>
<P>
"The constant publicity and stories rubs off on all of us," noted Senate 
Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, one of many lawmakers who insisted 
"there's no way" that as many lawmakers have been taking bribes as the public 
believes. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Smith, a veteran political consultant who is managing the campaign of Sen. 
Marion Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) for the GOP lieutenant governor nomination, 
asserted that all the scandals really are just beginning to sink in with the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever you are seeing now is going to be 10 times worse by June," Smith 
predicted. "The year's going to bode poorly for any candidate who is seen as an 
insider. The wheeler-dealer candidate is going to have real problems." 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson's campaign opponent, Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), agreed "there's no 
doubt whatsoever" that political ethics is ripe for political exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Otto Bos, who is directing U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson's campaign for the Republican 
gubernatorial nomination, said Wilson plans to present himself to the 
electorate as a "squeaky clean outsider" to Sacramento. Wilson will remind 
voters that as mayor of San Diego he sponsored a tough campaign finance law, 
Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was in 1972 -- before Watergate, before it was fashionable to be for 
campaign reform," Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature is sponsoring its own ballot proposal aimed at cleaning up its 
image by curbing the most flagrant ethical abuses of lawmakers. But the measure 
has become controversial because legislators linked the ethics reform to 
creation of a commission empowered to give them a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
Richie Ross, formerly Speaker Brown's chief of staff and now Van de Kamp's 
campaign manager, said the "sad, regrettable fact" is that the Legislature's 
ethics proposal suffers from the negative image of its sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature doesn't realize how deep the problem goes with the public," 
Ross said. "It does not see that the very fact it is authoring the (ballot) 
measure reduces its credibility, regardless of the merits." 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Lloyd G. Connelly (D-Sacramento), considered one of the more 
reform-minded legislators, said, "the poll didn't surprise me. It's consistent 
with what I find when I go to the hardware store or go to get a haircut. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"People in the United States, since after George Washington's presidency ended, 
have been suspicious as hell of their elected officials. And they ought to be."

REGISTERING OF 300,000 ASSAULT GUNS BEGINS; 
</P>
<P>
WEAPONS: TOUGH FIRST-IN-NATION LAW CONTROLS THE MANUFACTURE, SALE, POSSESSION 
AND OWNERSHIP OF HIGH-POWERED MILITARY-STYLE GUNS.

<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp on Wednesday announced procedures for 
Californians to register under the state's highly restrictive new law an 
estimated 300,000 assault weapons that have been legally acquired. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Van de Kamp -- a Democratic candidate for governor -- warned 
street gangs and drug traffickers "that we are going to enforce it to the 
hilt." 
</P>
<P>
The first-in-the-nation law to strictly control the manufacture, sale, 
possession and ownership of high-firepower military-style arms was passed by 
the Legislature and signed by Gov. George Deukmejian last spring. It took 
effect Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation prohibits at least 55 different assault weapons from casual 
over-the-counter sale in an effort to severely curb the kind of weapon that was 
fired into a crowded Stockton school playground nearly one year ago by deranged 
gunman Patrick Purdy. Five children were killed and 29 others and a teacher 
wounded. Purdy then killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties for violating the law, enacted over the fierce opposition of gun 
owners and the National Rifle Assn., range from fines to stiff prison 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), co-author of the 
legislation, told a press conference that the mere fact that the law has been 
on the books since last May appears to have served as a deterrent to use of 
assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, he said, the Sheriff's Department has seized only two or 
three assault guns in the last seven months, compared to 188 confiscated in 
1988. He said police in Oakland confiscated 50 such guns during the past four 
months, compared to 107 in the first three months of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
While sale of assault weapons is now against the law -- except under strictly 
limited circumstances -- thousands of law-abiding Californians still possess 
them -- apparently as collectors, for self-protection or target shooting. The 
new law allows them to keep their guns if they were legally acquired before 
June 1, 1989, but they must be registered under the state's first outright gun 
registration system. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1954, prospective handgun owners have been required to wait for 15 days 
while the Department of Justice conducts a background check to weed out those 
who have a criminal past or have been committed to a mental hospital. Hunting 
rifle and shotgun buyers are not subject to a waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
The new assault gun process directly links the firearm to the owner, along with 
computerized information, such as the address of where the weapon will be 
stored. 
</P>
<P>
Under the registration procedure, people who want to keep their assault-type 
firearms have until next Jan. 1 to register them. Failure to register will 
result in a $350 fine for the first violation, while subsequent offenses call 
for prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
Registration forms are available at local police and sheriff's offices and must 
be completed under penalty of perjury. Among other things, applicants will be 
required to give a thumbprint, pay a $20 fee and individually list their 
weapon's serial number, make, model, caliber, date of acquisition and from whom 
it was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
Registration will be denied to people with a criminal background or history of 
mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
For those who do register, however, the Department of Justice will not provide 
gun owners with a formal permit that their firearms are registered. Kati 
Corsaut, a spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, suggested that owners 
carry a letter that will be sent from the department stating that the weapon is 
registered. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that the computerized registration information will be immediately 
available to local peace officers if registration becomes an issue with law 
enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows how many assault guns are in California. But Corsaut said 275,000 
registration forms have been sent to local police and sheriff departments so 
far. She said that based on NRA testimony last spring, officials believe that 
there are approximately 300,000 assault guns subject to registration. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Judy, lobbyist for the NRA, conceded that he did not know how many 
assault guns are in California but said, "I'll tell you there are two or three 
times as many as there were a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
Judy said this was because in the last few weeks before the bill was signed, 
buyers made a frenzied run on assault weapons, whose prices doubled and tripled 
literally overnight. Some dealers reported selling more Uzi, AK-47 and AR-15 
assault arms in a few days than they had sold in all previous years combined. 
</P>
<P>
A special permit, virtually the same one now required for possession of a 
machine gun, is now mandated for people who bought an assault gun between June 
1, 1989, and Jan. 1 and for those who want to buy such a weapon in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Citizen ownership of machine guns has long been prohibited without a permit. 
The permits are usually issued only to film and television companies, certain 
gunsmiths and gun manufacturers who sell to law enforcement agencies.

William Roper, a White House adviser and former director of the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs, was named Wednesday to head the Centers for Disease Control. 
</P>
<P>
Roper, 41, on March 1 will take over a federal agency with 5,000 employees and 
an annual budget of $1.1 billion, including $450 million for AIDS-related work. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC has headquarters in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
The American Medical Assn. hailed the selection of Roper for the post, but some 
AIDS activists said they knew little about his views on AIDS issues. 
</P>
<P>
"He's sort of an AIDS unknown," said Robert Bray of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to tracking AIDS, the CDC is responsible for investigating and 
containing other infectious diseases and for finding ways to reduce mortality 
and occupational injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of health and human services, announced the 
selection of Roper and noted the CDC's "leading role" in fighting acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Roper will replace Dr. James O. Mason, who left last year to become assistant 
secretary for health.

FIRST LADY BEGINS RADIATION FOR EYE CONDITION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: MEDICATION FAILS TO RELIEVE PAINFUL SWELLING CAUSED BY THYROID 
DISORDER. THE NEXT STEP COULD BE SURGERY. 
</P>

<P>
First Lady Barbara Bush, suffering from persistent double vision and swelling 
around her eyes, began 10 days of daily radiation treatments Wednesday to 
relieve the symptoms of a thyroid condition known as Graves' disease. 
</P>
<P>
The painful inflammation, which causes excessive tearing and discomfort, was 
first noticed a year ago about the time President Bush was inaugurated. 
Physicians since have attempted to treat it with medication. 
</P>
<P>
If the low-level radiation treatments at Walter Reed Army Medical Center do not 
produce better results, experts said, the next line of attack could include 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, the White House has portrayed the condition as relatively 
minor and temporary. Mrs. Bush, 64, has maintained a full agenda of public 
appearances, carrying out a schedule with no suggestion that the condition has 
forced her to curtail her activities. 
</P>
<P>
The move to the radiation treatments, however, suggests that she is finding it 
more difficult to shrug off the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If one looks at a large number of patients with Graves' Disease, the 
proportion of patients who have major difficulties with this kind of ocular 
problem is really pretty small," said Dr. Robert Utiger, an endocrinologist 
formerly associated with the University of North Carolina department of 
medicine and now deputy editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush spent several hours at the hospital in Washington Wednesday, 
undergoing pretreatment tests and the first 10-minute radiation treatment. Upon 
returning to the White House, she visited briefly with the President and then 
completed her customary one-mile swim in the heated, outdoor pool on the White 
House grounds, her press secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like going to the dentist, except better," Mrs. Bush said after the 
treatment, according to Press Secretary Anna Perez. 
</P>
<P>
The thyroid condition for which Mrs. Bush is being treated was named after 
Robert Graves, a 19th-Century Irish physician who first described it. It is 
caused when the body's immune system attacks parts of the body itself. The 
primary targets are cells in the thyroid gland, a small, butterfly-shaped gland 
in the neck, and in the small muscles that control the movement of the eyes in 
their sockets. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Bush underwent treatment with radioactive iodine on April 12 to destroy 
the thyroid gland, which was producing excess amounts of hormones. Among the 
symptoms were the ocular irritation and a 21-pound weight loss over a period of 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, she began treatments with a drug known as prednisone, a powerful 
steroid in the cortisone family. But despite upbeat reports, it appeared that 
Mrs. Bush's eyes -- given a bulging appearance by the swelling -- were not 
responding satisfactorily to the medication. On Nov. 29, she visited the Mayo 
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., for further examination. 
</P>
<P>
The radiation treatment, which was begun Wednesday at Walter Reed, has been 
used for many years. 
</P>
<P>
It is "a sort of second-line treatment," Utiger said. "It's not one that is 
usually done initially or in a patient who has had a favorable response to 
prednisone." 
</P>
<P>
The success rate is "a matter of some controversy," he said, and the medical 
literature has shown that it has produced mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
"The alternative is a surgical procedure," Utiger said. Under one operation, 
bits of bone that form the cup in which the eye sits are removed, to provide 
more room for the swollen tissue. 
</P>
<P>
Perez said that the prednisone had served its primary purpose -- to stabilize 
the symptoms -- and that the condition is not getting any worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Doctors do not look at prednisone as a long-term therapy," she said, adding 
that it is hoped that Mrs. Bush can be weaned from the drug, administered in a 
pill, when her radiation treatments end. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, as well as endocrinologists, said that no physical side effects from the 
radiation are expected. 
</P>
<P>
Utiger said that the dosage is considerably smaller, and more targeted, than 
the radiation commonly administered for treatment of brain tumors or cancers in 
various organs and is not likely to produce the fatigue, nausea or hair loss 
associated with such therapy. 
</P>
<P>
However, he said that care must be taken in irradiating the tissue behind the 
eye so that the lens and cornea will not be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
When she visited the Mayo Clinic, Mrs. Bush told a reporter who asked how she 
felt: "Listen, I could wrestle you to the ground. Nobody feels any better than 
I do."

<P>
With winds gusting up to 40 m.p.h., heavy sea swells pushed a 100-square-mile 
oil slick to within 12 miles of Morocco's Atlantic coastline Wednesday, 
hampering a cleanup operation and raising fears that the vessel could break up 
in the storm. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said weather conditions deteriorated sharply Wednesday and 
pushed the oil oozing from the 283,632-ton Iranian tanker Kharg 5 toward the 
port of Oualidia, about 80 miles south of Casablanca. 
</P>
<P>
Fisheries, tourist beaches, a migratory bird reserve and an important breeding 
ground of pink flamingoes would be threatened by the oil, the Interior Ministry 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Moroccan authorities said floating barriers were laid along the coastline, but 
French experts doubt they can withstand the high seas. Despite the weather, 
cleanup crews continued to spray oil dispersants into the spill. 
</P>
<P>
Morocco on Wednesday threatened to file a lawsuit against Iran's national oil 
company as a result of the spill. It also criticized salvage workers for 
reacting too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
A series of unexplained explosions on the night of Dec. 18-19 tore through the 
Kharg 5's hull, rupturing its tanks. So far, 70,000 tons of crude oil have been 
spilled into Moroccan waters. 
</P>
<P>
The tanker, which still has 200,000 tons of crude in its tanks, is reportedly 
being towed to the Cape Verde Islands, where the remaining oil will be 
unloaded, the salvage company said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday that the Coast Guard is 
sending a team of experts to Morocco in response to that government's request 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
In the Netherlands, a shipping official said that Dutch authorities had 
prevented five Iranian supertankers from leaving Rotterdam in the last 14 
months because they failed to meet international safety standards, the news 
agency ANP said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The official said that three of the vessels are sister ships to the Kharg 5. 
All the vessels were permitted to leave after the most necessary repairs were 
made. 
</P>

The government of Taiwan executed a record 69 people in 1989, more than triple 
the number shot the previous year, a Justice Ministry spokesman said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan law allows the death penalty for murder, rape, kidnaping, gang robbery 
and other serious crimes. Executions are often carried out with a shot through 
the heart while the criminal lies face down in a sandpit. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said in a telephone interview that 22 people were executed in 
1988, and 94 people between 1978 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, a country of 20 million people, has been plagued by a crime wave, with 
almost daily reports of robberies, kidnapings, shoot-outs and murders.

ROMANIA AIDE DENIES ARMY PLANNED A COUP; 
</P>
<P>
EAST BLOC: CHIEF OF STAFF SAYS REVOLUTION WAS SPONTANEOUS BUT THAT DISCONTENT 
HAD BEEN MOUNTING. 
</P>

<P>
BUCHAREST, Romania -- The deputy defense minister denied Wednesday that the 
army had been planning a coup against dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, but he said 
there had been widespread discontent in the military before the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Col. Gen. Vasili Ionel, who is also the army chief of staff, 
dismissed reports that the defense minister, Nicolae Militaru, had said the 
armed forces had been planning for six months to move against the Ceausescu 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
"I declare openly and firmly that Gen. Militaru did not make such a statement," 
Ionel said. "The revolution was spontaneous, but discontent had been piling up 
for years and years, especially since Ceausescu had been leading the country as 
a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
"This discontent was experienced by every Romanian, civilian and military 
alike. The army was discontented with its treatment by Ceausescu and with the 
way it was used by Ceausescu as a labor force for huge projects of no value to 
Romania." 
</P>
<P>
But the army did nothing "to trigger off the revolution," he said, adding: "The 
revolution was made by the people, and it broke out spontaneously. The army 
supported the revolution from the first moment." 
</P>
<P>
These statements from the army's top commander appeared to be aimed, at least 
in part, at deflecting criticism that some Romanian military commanders were 
slow to react to the revolution and delayed giving orders to the army to join 
forces with the people in the streets until it was clear that Ceausescu had 
been ousted. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Gen. Ionel said the army commanders at Timisoara, in western Transylvania, 
had been given orders to shoot at the demonstrators, whom Ceausescu referred to 
as "hooligans." 
</P>
<P>
"I declare now that the army did not shoot at the people," Ionel said. "On the 
contrary, the army withdrew, erected some barricades and let the people pass. 
But within the army, there were infiltrators from the state security forces, 
and they were the ones who fired at the people. The dead of Timisoara were not 
killed by army bullets." 
</P>
<P>
The number of dead in Timisoara has not been determined, although the 
government has said that as many as 3,500 or 4,000 may have died there. Some 
journalists believe the death toll there is much lower. No mass graves have 
been found that would support such a high death toll, but there have been 
unconfirmed reports that some bodies were flown out of the region. The 
provisional government has said the death toll for the entire country may be as 
high as 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
Ionel said the country was now fully under army control and that if any men of 
the security forces, the Securitate, are still at large, they are not many, 
were isolated and not able to fight. He dismissed rumors that a large force of 
Securitate men were encamped somewhere in the Carpathian mountains, preparing 
an attack. 
</P>
<P>
"We know our country and our mountains very well," Ionel said, "and there is no 
such force." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he went on, "we continue to be very careful; we keep some targets under 
military guard." Tanks are still drawn up on the lawn of the Foreign Ministry, 
the new government's headquarters, and the families of leading figures of the 
National Salvation Front and the interim government are guarded round the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
Ionel also denied reports that an Iranian force had been sent to help 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"Ceausescu had his own units of defense," he said. "They were trained for this 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
These units, he said, "numbered in the thousands" and were better trained and 
equipped than any other military units in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We suppose all this part of the presidential guard has been arrested," Ionel 
said. "They no longer have weapons or the possibility to use them. They are all 
being interrogated. The interrogations have not been finished, and it has not 
been determined what punishment will be imposed on them. We want them to have 
fair trials, and prosecutors will decide on what penalties to ask for, 
depending on what the terrorists have done." 
</P>
<P>
Ionel declined to say how many had been arrested, and he said he could not tell 
how many of those arrested were civilian or military. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the bodyguards and security guards, all are military-trained and some 
have military ranks," he said. "But they were not dressed in military clothing. 
They carried no identity, and we had no idea who they were or which force they 
belonged to." 
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Front has called for its committees from across the 
country to meet today in the capital. It will be the first gathering of the 
regional leaders since the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
An official said the talks may develop coordination between the capital and the 
provinces.

TEXT OF PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT ON NORIEGA

<P>
The following is a text of President Bush's statement Wednesday night 
announcing that deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega has surrendered 
to U.S. authorities: 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Dec. 20, I ordered U.S. troops to Panama with four objectives: 
safeguard the lives of American citizens, help restore democracy, protect the 
integrity of the Panama Canal Treaties and bring Gen. Manuel Noriega to 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
All of these objectives have now been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
At about 8:50 this evening, Gen. Noriega turned himself in to U.S. authorities 
in Panama with the full knowledge of the Panamanian government. He was taken to 
Howard Air Force Base in Panama, where he was arrested by DEA. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Air Force C-130 is now transporting Gen. Noriega to Homestead Air Force 
Base, Florida. He will be arraigned in the U.S. District Court in Miami on 
charges stemming from his previous indictment for drug trafficking. I want to 
thank the Vatican and the papal nuncio in Panama for their evenhanded, 
statesmanlike assistance in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is committed to providing Gen. Noriega a fair trial. 
Nevertheless, his apprehension and return to the United States will send a 
clear signal that the United States is serious in its determination that those 
charged with promoting the distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
The return of Gen. Noriega marks a significant milestone in Operation Just 
Cause. The U.S. used its resources in a manner consistent with political, 
diplomatic and moral principles. 
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. combat troops have already been withdrawn from Panama. Others 
will follow as quickly as the local situation will permit. We are now engaged 
in the final stages of a process that includes the economic and political 
revitalization of this important friend and neighbor, Panama. 
</P>
<P>
An economic team under the direction of Deputy Secretary of State Eagleburger 
and Deputy Secretary of Treasury Robson is just returning from Panama. A team 
of experts has remained on hand there to assess the full range of needs. 
</P>
<P>
We will continue to extend to the Panamanian people our support and assistance 
in the days ahead. Panamanians and Americans both have sacrificed much to 
restore democracy to Panama. The armed forces of the United States have 
performed their mission courageously and effectively. And I again want to 
express my gratitude and appreciation to all of them. 
</P>
<P>
And I want to express the special thanks of our nation to those servicemen who 
were wounded and to the families of those who gave their lives. Their sacrifice 
has been a noble cause that will never be forgotten. A free and prosperous 
Panama will be an enduring tribute. Thank you all very very much.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds of laughing, cheering Panamanians poured into the streets of Panama 
City on Wednesday night, celebrating the news that former strongman Manuel A. 
Noriega had handed himself over to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We are relieved to be rid of this criminal. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing was that he should leave our national territory. It's a 
great moment," President Guillermo Endara said. "We have to feel happy. God has 
blessed us in these last few days." 
</P>
<P>
Sheer jubilation gripped the capital of 1 million residents just moments after 
radio and television announced that the former strongman had abandoned his 
Vatican embassy sanctuary after a 10-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanian television broke into its normal programming to broadcast a news 
flash that Noriega had turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the approaching 11 p.m. curfew imposed after thousands of American 
troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20 to overthrow Noriega and install a new 
government, residents of the capital set off fireworks and opened bottles to 
toast Noriega's departure. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it official? Is he really gone?" many disbelievers asked reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Panamanians spilled into the streets, laughing, banging pots and pans and 
applauding. Hundreds converged on Avenida Balboa, where the Vatican mission was 
framed in a burst of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's over! It's over!" people shouted, some screaming themselves hoarse. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God. Panama can now feel like a free country. I feel free now," said 
20-year-old Moises Rios.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 10 days after being overthrown in a U.S. military invasion and taking 
refuge in the Vatican embassy, Manuel A. Noriega lived a secluded, Spartan 
life, sealed off from the outside world by the reluctant host of his diplomatic 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a day, the deposed dictator of Panama opened the door to his 
sweltering second-floor room in the Vatican nunciature, accepted a meal on a 
tray and shut himself in again, according to visitors to the embassy compound. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks tired, pale and depressed," a Roman Catholic Church official said 
before Noriega surrendered himself to U.S. authorities late Wednesday. "He 
hardly speaks." 
</P>
<P>
For those 10 days, however, as the Vatican, the Bush Administration and the 
U.S.-installed Panamanian government negotiated his fate, the 54-year-old 
Noriega apparently remained as stubborn and secretive in captivity as he was 
during the seven years he ruled Panama as military commander. 
</P>
<P>
After narrowly escaping capture by American troops who invaded Panama on Dec. 
20 and put a $1-million bounty on his head, an exhausted Noriega slipped into 
the nunciature on Christmas Eve and surrendered an Uzi submachine gun. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked like a hunted fox," one diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega slept through three days of ear-splitting rock music blared toward the 
embassy from loudspeakers by American troops surrounding the place -- 
harassment that kept awake his host, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, and was 
shut off only after Laboa's repeated complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday night, Noriega resisted Laboa's own campaign to pressure him to 
leave voluntarily by shutting off the air conditioning in his quarters, thus 
allowing the room temperature to rise into the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously missing from the life of Panama's former self-proclaimed "maximum 
leader" in this period were the pornographic photos and large quantities of 
cocaine that American officials say they found in his many homes. The nuns at 
the nunciature even took care to remove the wine from the guest wing where 
Noriega was left free to roam. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his stay, Noriega had no access to radio or newspapers. Everything 
he learned from the outside was filtered through brief daily conversations with 
Laboa, a 66-year-old Spanish Basque who, as Vatican nuncio since 1982, is the 
dean of Panama's foreign diplomatic corps. 
</P>
<P>
"Laboa has been trying to get him to see that he cannot stay there for the rest 
of his life," said a European diplomat before the surrender. 
</P>
<P>
But each time Laboa asked him to go, said a church official, Noriega gave the 
same answer: "I am not ready." 
</P>
<P>
From his window in the three-story embassy, in the seaside Punta Paitilla 
neighborhood, Noriega looked out on rolls of concertina wire, U.S. tanks, 
armored vehicles and elite Delta Force troops surrounding the place, waiting 
for him to step outside. He could hear U.S. army helicopters hovering overhead 
or landing in a nearby field. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican, following diplomatic precedent, agreed to give Noriega temporary 
refuge while it determined whether he was being pursued for criminal or 
political activity. He was indicted in the United States on drug charges, and 
Panama said last week that it planned to charge him with murder in connection 
with a failed coup against him last October. 
</P>
<P>
Even before Noriega decided to leave the nunciature voluntarily, church 
officials said the Vatican had classified him as an accused criminal and was 
therefore willing to end his sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
However, diplomatic precedent inhibited the Vatican from handing Noriega 
directly over to the Americans as a foreign occupying power. And the Panamanian 
government said it did not want such a problem prisoner in its own disorganized 
legal system. The new Panamanian government also pointed out that the 
Panamanian constitution bars the extradition of one of its own citizens to 
another country for trial. 
</P>
<P>
As pro-Noriega resistance to the American invasion died out, Panamanians who 
struggled for years against the dictator turned their ire against the Vatican 
for harboring Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 citizens signed a letter urging Pope John Paul II to end his 
"ambivalent attitude" and turn Noriega over to "authorities with immediate 
capacity to bring him to justice" for "horrendous crimes." 
</P>
<P>
Within earshot of Noriega, about 10,000 Panamanians gathered Wednesday 
afternoon, in the first major demonstration since his downfall, to demand his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, as diplomatic cars and light armored vehicles moved back and 
forth between the nunciature and the high school across the street where the 
American, Vatican and Panamanian negotiators were meeting, Noriega became "very 
nervous," according to a church official who saw him. 
</P>
<P>
Friends of Laboa, a jovial, extroverted man, say he has been wounded by 
criticism against the Vatican. They say he believes he spared Panama much 
bloodshed by giving sanctuary to Noriega, under the same principle of 
diplomatic immunity that protected foes of the dictatorship who were running 
for their lives. Laboa's defenders have noted that Noriega had never violated 
the Vatican sanctuary to arrest anyone. 
</P>
<P>
According to several accounts, Laboa got a Christmas Eve phone call from 
Noriega in a house somewhere nearby. Having dealt with Noriega over the asylum 
of at least a dozen political figures who fled into the nunciature to escape 
his repression, the nuncio instantly recognized Noriega's voice. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega asked Laboa for refuge, saying that otherwise he would go into the 
jungle and lead a prolonged guerrilla war, a friend of the nuncio said. After 
quick reflection, the nuncio agreed. Shortly thereafter, Noriega drove his own 
car to the nunciature's ornate iron gate, rang the bell and was escorted 
through the mansion's yellow wall. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, several hundred members of Noriega's Defense Forces and Dignity 
Battalions were fighting a sporadic war of resistance on Noriega's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"The moment I accepted him, I knew that his people would decide that he was a 
bloody coward and stop fighting," a diplomatic colleague quoted Laboa as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the nuncio tried to get Noriega to tape a message instructing his 
followers to surrender. The former dictator refused, then fell into an 18-hour 
slumber. By the time he woke up, resistance to the new regime had dwindled.

Members of Congress exulted Wednesday night over the surrender of deposed

A veteran of the Detroit police force, Harold L. Johnson Jr., has been hired as 
police chief of Mobile, Ala., the first black police chief in a major Alabama 
city. 
</P>
<P>
A second black man, Reuben Greenberg, was chosen for the post of public safety 
director, which is above that of police chief. Greenberg is chief of police in 
Charleston, S.C. Mobile's population of 200,000 is about 37% black. Lt. Sam 
Cochran, vice president of the Mobile County Law Enforcement Assn., said the 
organization objected to hiring Johnson at more than $65,000 a year because 
starting salary for a uniformed officer is $14,000 a year. Cochran, who is 
white, said race was not a factor in opposition to the hirings.

The shuttle Columbia was cleared for launching Monday on a 10-day flight, with 
the countdown scheduled to begin today. 
</P>
<P>
It is to put a Navy communications satellite in orbit and retrieve a school 
bus-size satellite used to test the durability of potential spacecraft 
materials. That satellite will drop back into the atmosphere soon if it is not 
retrieved. Liftoff had been scheduled for Dec. 18, but the launch pad at Cape 
Canaveral, Fla., that Columbia is using has been out of service for years, and 
refurbishing took longer than expected.

Exxon said that more than 500,000 gallons of heating oil -- not 5,000 gallons 
-- may have leaked from its underwater pipeline into the Arthur Kill shipping 
channel at Linden, N. J. Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Crawley said the company 
put the size of the spill at between 420,000 gallons and 546,000 gallons. The 
Coast Guard at first estimated the leakage of No. 2 oil, discovered Tuesday 
morning, at 5,000 gallons. Meanwhile, emergency crews worked to contain the 
floating oil with booms and traps and were vacuuming the surface of the 
channel, which separates New Jersey from Staten Island, N.Y. Divers found a 
gash 4 feet long in the pipeline.

MONTOYA'S SECRETARY TELLS OF FINANCIAL SHENANIGANS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Sen. Joseph B. Montoya used his campaign funds to buy a variety of 
personal items and pocketed reimbursements from the state for his airline 
travel, a longtime secretary to the Whittier Democrat testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Kaut, who has worked for Montoya since 1975, also said she regularly 
marked Montoya's calendar "code green" on days he was scheduled to collect 
honorariums or campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"Code green," she told the federal court jury, was more discreet than the 
"little dollar signs" she had used previously to denote meetings where the 
senator would be receiving money. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day Wednesday, two Sacramento businessmen testified that Montoya's 
former top aide, Amiel Jaramillo, once told them that they should consider 
giving the senator a donation if they wanted to win his backing. 
</P>
<P>
"He said if we wanted to get his (Montoya's) attention we might consider an 
honorarium," testified Larry McCracken, one of the businessmen who was seeking 
the senator's vote against a bill. "I was incredulous. . . . I felt that I had 
just been solicited for a bribe." 
</P>
<P>
Montoya, the first legislator indicted as a result of a four-year federal 
investigation into political corruption in the state Capitol, is on trial in 
federal court on 12 counts of extortion, racketeering, bribery and money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony about Jaramillo's fund-raising efforts and Montoya's handling of 
his campaign funds does not directly support any of the 12 counts against the 
senator, but it does serve to strengthen the prosecution's portrayal of Montoya 
as a greedy legislator who was seeking to profit personally from his position. 
</P>
<P>
Kaut, a reluctant witness for the prosecution, testified that she kept track of 
all expenditures and receipts for Montoya's campaign account, including paying 
bills for credit cards the senator used. 
</P>
<P>
At Montoya's direction, Kaut said, she routinely used campaign funds to pay for 
the senator's personal purchases, including clothes, videos, a life insurance 
policy and, on one occasion, a $2,200 set of encyclopedias. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, it is illegal to use campaign funds for personal purposes, 
although Montoya has not been charged with such a violation in this case. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya also paid for airline tickets out of his campaign account and received 
reimbursement from the state, Kaut said, but did not pay the money back to his 
campaign account. "I don't know where he put it," she told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the jury heard testimony that Montoya received a $350 
reimbursement for air fare from the Allan Co., a Los Angeles recycling firm, 
and later deposited the money in a business bank account he controlled. 
</P>
<P>
Kaut testified that she and other members of the staff regularly carried out 
campaign fund-raising activities on state time with state equipment. Staff 
members also handled the management duties for rental property owned by 
Montoya, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The use of state resources for personal or campaign purposes is a violation of 
state law, but no charges have been filed in connection with these alleged 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Montoya's staff benefited by borrowing thousands of dollars from the 
senator's campaign funds, sometimes not paying back the money for years, she 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who borrowed campaign money, she said, were former aide Jaramillo; 
secretary Rachel Fontes, who handled most of Montoya's rental matters; 
committee consultant Steven English, and Leonard Talbert, husband of one of 
Montoya's campaign treasurers. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Kaut herself testified that she had borrowed money three times from 
Montoya, including a $1,500 loan in 1980 or 1981 that she never repaid. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Kaut told the jury that she had borrowed campaign money on only two 
occasions and had paid all of it back. But under questioning by Assistant U.S. 
Atty. John Panneton, Kaut admitted the existence of the third, unpaid loan. 
</P>
<P>
McCracken, a partner in an employment agency, and Ray Castile, a former partner 
in a different agency, were among a group of people who had gone to the Capitol 
in 1986 seeking Montoya's opposition to a bill deregulating a portion of the 
employment agency industry. 
</P>
<P>
They testified that Jaramillo informed them the senator had already decided to 
support the bill but if they wanted to meet with him, they should consider 
making an honorarium and taking the senator to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe this was how the government worked -- that you had to pay 
someone to get their attention," McCracken testified. 
</P>
<P>
However, there were several discrepancies in the testimony of the two men. 
McCracken said Jaramillo suggested the group pay a $5,000 honorarium and invite 
the entire Senate committee to dinner at a posh restaurant. Castile, a former 
deputy chief of personnel services for the state Department of Consumer 
Affairs, testified that Jaramillo suggested a minimum $500 payment and a meal 
just with Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
McCracken, a reserve police officer in the nearby city of Folsom, testified 
that he was particularly outraged by the request for money. But under 
cross-examination by defense attorney Michael Sands, McCracken acknowledged 
that he had never taken his complaint to any law enforcement agency. 
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo faces trial in March on five counts of extortion, racketeering and 
conspiracy growing out of the same investigation.

STATE FARM SUES TO UPSET GILLESPIE'S PROP. 103 ACTIONS; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: A VICTORY, OR A 'PEACE TREATY' HINTED AT BY THE COMMISSIONER, COULD 
DELAY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INITIATIVE. 
</P>

<P>
The State Farm Insurance Co. announced Wednesday that it has filed a lawsuit to 
invalidate Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie's actions that struck down 
sex and marital status in setting auto insurance rates, curtailed 
neighborhood-based pricing and capped rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
Accusing Gillespie of mandating pricing methods that would lead to rates 
"inadequate for some drivers, excessive for others and unfairly discriminatory 
for all," the State Farm suit also contends that the rate cap pegged to last 
year's consumer price index would unconstitutionally deprive the company of a 
fair return on its California business. 
</P>
<P>
"The consumer price index bears no relationship to the cost of providing 
insurance in California," a company statement said. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm lawyers expressed hope that San Francisco Superior Court Judge John 
A. Ertola, who was assigned the case, will grant an injunction barring 
Gillespie from implementing the regulations. A hearing on the suit, filed last 
Friday, is likely to be held within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Karl Rubinstein, Gillespie's special attorney for implementing Proposition 103, 
said Wednesday that the commissioner might seek a "peace treaty" with State 
Farm and other companies, under which she would delay her pricing regulations 
pending results of Proposition 103 hearings now under way in San Bruno, while 
the State Farm lawsuit was held in abeyance. 
</P>
<P>
Fair Rate of Return 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said it would be difficult for Gillespie to present a comprehensive 
argument supporting her regulations against the suit until she decides, after 
the San Bruno hearings, what fair rate of return the companies are entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
Not until such a standard is set will it become clear that Gillespie's pricing 
regulations are fair to the companies, Rubinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
This was the first suggestion from Gillespie's side that the "emergency" 
regulations she imposed with great fanfare Dec. 5 might be subject to new 
delays. Gillespie is already giving the companies 60 days to submit new pricing 
standards and 150 days before the regulations have to be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said he had not yet had any lengthy discussions on his peace treaty 
idea with State Farm or insurance industry attorneys but said he had broached 
the idea with a State Farm attorney Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion of a new agreement between Gillespie and the insurers, following 
an agreement last fall, drew quick criticism from Harvey Rosenfield, head of 
the Voter Revolt organization and author of Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
"We will fight any efforts by Gillespie to further negotiate the enforcement of 
Proposition 103 with any insurance company," Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"In passing proposition 103 more than a year ago, the public did not give 
Roxani Gillespie any right to bargain away rollbacks, diminution of territorial 
ratings or any of the deadlines contained in Proposition 103," he said. "It 
seems quite clear that Gillespie is anxious to postpone any action on enforcing 
Proposition 103 until after the 1990 elections. 
</P>
<P>
"She has followed a strategy of encouraging litigation by repeatedly issuing 
and then renegotiating and then litigating each of her regulations. She may be 
intentionally issuing defective regulations that would invite the legal 
challenges that will tie this up in court. I believe her actions are intended 
to protect the Republican Party and the insurance industry." 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie called Rosenfield's comments nonsense. She insisted that any delay 
from an agreement with insurers would be only a few weeks. She said that 
finishing the hearings and establishing a fair rate of return would give her a 
far better legal argument in defending against the State Farm lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Although State Farm sued on its own behalf, it is seeking a sweeping series of 
permanent remedies that would affect all of the several hundred companies 
selling auto insurance in California. 
</P>
<P>
A legal victory for the company at the least would lead to new lengthy delays 
in implementing Proposition 103's auto insurance pricing provisions and could 
result in a significant portion of the landmark initiative being held 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm, the largest seller of auto insurance in California, with about 17% 
of the total market, seeks in the lawsuit to largely retain the status quo in 
the auto insurance pricing system, under which urban dwellers in Los Angeles 
and San Francisco pay far more for auto coverage than people in suburban and 
rural parts of the state, although it says it is ready to make some 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, the company strongly objects to the part of Gillespie's 
regulations that requires insurers to lower prices for urban dwellers without 
being allowed at the same time to recoup losses by charging rural and suburban 
drivers equivalent increases.

POLICE SEEK MAN LINKED TO SERIES OF RAPES AND BREAK-INS

<P>
Detectives are hunting for a man who has been linked to three recent rapes, 
including an attack on a 10-year-old girl, and as many as 10 break-ins in a 
four-square-block area of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The string of crimes began on July 3 with a break-in in which a 25-year-old 
woman was raped, said Sgt. Jo Anne Ablott, who is heading the Sheriff's 
Department investigation. The victim lived in the 14600 block of Dartmoor 
Avenue in the southeast part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ablott declined to release details of evidence that led investigators to link 
the crimes, but she said the suspect apparently watched the victims' houses for 
days before the attacks to determine when their husbands went to work or if 
they lived alone. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were treated at local hospitals and released. Nothing was stolen in 
any of the incidents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"These (attacks) are very precise, controlled," Ablott said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives suspect the attacker lives in the neighborhood, or is a relative or 
friend of a resident. "He knows the neighborhood very well," Ablott said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the neighborhood of modest homes said they have been leaving on 
their porch and patio lights all night and making sure doors and windows are 
locked at night. 
</P>
<P>
"It's getting us so wound up . . . " said Becca Ehrenkranz, 26, who lives with 
her family on Seaforth Avenue, where most of the incidents have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives held a neighborhood meeting last month to warn residents and solicit 
information. Ablott said she receives about a dozen tips a day, but there have 
been no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Ablott said sheriff's deputies have been circulating through the neighborhood 
and offering tips on home security. Officials and residents also are organizing 
a Neighborhood Watch group in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We ask them to be double careful," Ablott said. She said that each of the 
victims had not taken adequate security measures. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 detectives and deputies are working on the case, she said. "We have 
used dogs. We've used helicopters, undercover officers," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have linked the following incidents: 
</P>
<P>
* A man entered a house on the 14600 block of Dartmoor Avenue through an 
unlocked front door shortly after 5 a.m. on July 3. He wore panty hose over his 
head and threatened his 25-year-old victim with a pistol before he raped her. 
Her husband had left for work. 
</P>
<P>
* On Sept. 2 at 5 a.m., a man climbed through an unlocked front window into a 
house on the 14500 block of Seaforth Avenue. He raped a 27-year-old woman, who 
was alone. He wore a stocking mask and carried a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
* An armed man, wearing a black bandanna over his face, entered an area home 
through an unlocked bedroom window at 4:45 a.m. on Oct. 8 and raped a 
10-year-old girl. The victim's father heard her crying and confronted the 
suspect, who threatened the father with a gun and escaped out the window. 
</P>
<P>
* A 45-year-old woman fought off a would-be attacker, who had reached through a 
broken window to unlock the door of a house on the 14600 block of Seaforth 
Avenue. The break-in occurred at 2:45 a.m. on Dec. 11. The burglar, who was 
wearing a ski mask. The victim was alone. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 30 and Dec. 17, a man was seen prowling around two houses on the 
14800 block of Seaforth Avenue. In one case, the suspect fled after a woman saw 
a man looking through her window and screamed. In the other incident, the 
suspect eluded a neighborhood man who chased him. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspect another six area break-ins may have been committed by the 
same man, although no solid link has been made, Ablott said. 
</P>
<P>
Two people who saw the Oct. 30 prowler provided a description for a composite 
drawing. They described the suspect as a white man with blond hair, about 5 
feet, 9 inches and about 165 pounds. The rape victims did not see their 
attacker's face, but the general description matched those given by the 
witnesses of the prowler, Ablott said. 
</P>
<P>
Ablott requests that anyone with information about the crimes call her at 
863-8711, Ext. 347.

Bellflower officials are asking residents to separate newspapers from their 
household garbage in an attempt to reduce the flow of trash to overburdened 
county landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Administrator Craig Nealis said the city will begin curbside pickup 
of bundled or bagged newspapers on Jan. 22. Nealis said the City Council also 
is considering asking residents to separate glass, plastic, aluminum and 
shrubbery for curbside pickup. 
</P>
<P>
Nealis said the voluntary recycling program was instituted in response to a 
state measure which requires cities to reduce up to 25% of their garbage by 
1995 and 50% by the year 2000.

on whether to allow a developer to build 49 apartment units along with 30 
single-family houses near the intersection of Wilmington Avenue and Compton 
Boulevard. Some residents and two council members, Patricia Moore and Maxcy 
Filer, adamantly oppose the apartment portion of the development, saying 
Compton must concentrate on single-family housing to attract middle-income 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
Apartments, according to their detractors, bring low-income renters for whom 
Compton cannot afford to provide services. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Walter Tucker and Councilwoman Jane Robbins voted to uphold the Planning 
Commission's decision to allow Madison Avenue Properties to build the 
apartments along with the houses. Councilwoman Bernice Woods was absent because 
of illness and the council said it wants to vote on the issue again when 
everyone is present. 
</P>
<P>
The developer is Evan Williams, owner of Dalton Construction Co., which has 
worked on several city projects.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: MONTEBELLO; 
</P>
<P>
$30 ANNUAL FEE ESTABLISHED FOR AMBULANCE, PARAMEDICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Montebello City Council has approved a program that will allow residents 
and businesses to pay a $30 annual fee to cover ambulance and paramedic 
services. 
</P>
<P>
The program, in which residents who want to sign up pay the city $30 and the 
city then covers all costs for paramedic and ambulance services, is expected to 
be implemented sometime this spring, Councilman William Molinari said. 
</P>
<P>
Molinari said the town's sizable senior citizen community would benefit most 
from such a service. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are now paying about $50 for paramedic service and about $250 for 
ambulance transport within Montebello city limits, Molinari said. 
</P>
<P>
"Senior citizens are particularly concerned about the expensive costs," 
Molinari said. "This gives them peace of mind. If they need ambulance service 
they don't have to worry about the cost." 
</P>
<P>
Because fees have not been determined for low-income and senior residents, it 
is unknown how many people will have to sign up in order for the program to 
become self-supporting, according to the staff report. It is estimated that 
more than 20% of the town's residents paying the standard $30 would join within 
a few years, bringing in $137,000 to cover costs.

COUNTY BIAS ALLEGED IN REMAP CASE; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: SUPERVISORS ACCUSED OF 'RACIAL GERRYMANDERING' IN REDISTRICTING 
LAWSUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a "greedy act" of self-preservation, Los Angeles County supervisors secretly 
fashioned a redistricting plan that diluted Latino voting strength in order to 
protect their own political bases, the U.S. Justice Department and two civil 
rights groups charged Wednesday at the opening of a historic trial. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an old-fashioned case about racial gerrymandering," said Mark 
Rosenbaum, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of 
Southern California, one of the plaintiffs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors has been accused in a suit filed by the Justice 
Department, the ACLU and the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund of dividing many of the county's 2 million Latinos among three districts, 
thereby weakening their political clout in violation of the federal Voting 
Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
During opening arguments, Rosenbaum called the board "the most powerful and 
enduring all-white club" in the nation. "Since 1875 -- for 115 years -- no 
person of Spanish surname has ever served on the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But John McDermott, a private attorney hired by the county, denied that the 
supervisors discriminated against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
For the plaintiffs to win, he said, "the court is going to have to make legal 
and political decisions that no court in a voting rights case has ever made." 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs are seeking to consolidate the heavily Latino neighborhoods 
encompassing East Los Angeles and growing immigrant neighborhoods in the San 
Gabriel Valley into one district in order to help a Latino win a seat on the 
five-member county board. The ACLU and MALDEF also have asked the court to 
consider expanding the board to seven members. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum said Wednesday that testimony will show the supervisors carried out 
the 1981 redistricting in "back rooms, by covert compacts among factions of the 
board, by private revolving-door meetings" of two supervisors at a time to 
sidestep a state law requiring that discussions involving three or more 
supervisors be conducted in public. 
</P>
<P>
The remapping, Rosenbaum argued, was the subject of a "fierce partisan" 
political struggle between the board's conservative majority of Mike 
Antonovich, Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum and liberal Supervisors Ed Edelman 
and Kenneth Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
"For each bloc, the county's Hispanic community was treated as the means to an 
end of either enlarging or maintaining the partisan balance of power," the ACLU 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbaum said conservative board members only wanted to increase the Latino 
makeup in a district represented by the liberal Edelman -- and liberal board 
members only wanted to shift Latinos to conservative Schabarum's district. 
</P>
<P>
"Where the Republican majority sought to send their Hispanics packing, so as to 
strengthen their long-term holds on their districts and their majority status, 
the Democrats wanted their Hispanics spread thin, so as to remain in a 
supporting roles and to pose an eventual challenge in Schabarum's district," 
the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither faction had the four votes necessary to add Latinos to the other's 
district. "It was in each incumbent's political self-interest to leave the 
Hispanic community divided and weak," Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
County lawyer McDermott said that during the 1981 redistricting, Antonovich and 
Dana pressed for a district with more Latinos. "That hardly bespeaks of 
discriminatory purpose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott said Edelman opposed the plan, "not because he was anti-Hispanic, but 
(because he) felt Hispanics could be better served if not packed into one 
district." He said Edelman believed Latinos would have more influence if 
represented by more than one supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
McDermott pointed out that a Latino group, Californios for Fair Representation, 
also spoke out in 1981 against putting all the Latinos in a single district 
because "they said that would be tokenism." 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors, who have paid nearly $1 million to private lawyers on the 
case, contend it was not possible to create a district with a majority of 
Latino voters, using 1980 Census figures. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs argue that such a district can be created, using the county's 
own 1987 population estimates. But county attorneys counter that they are only 
obliged to use the 1980 Census data. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon said he wants the trial to take no more 
than 120 hours, which could span roughly six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs plan to call each of the five supervisors to testify on their 
discussions leading up to adoption of the redistricting plan. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was delayed for several weeks when both sides sought unsuccessfully 
to reach an out-of-court settlement. Kenyon said Tuesday that once the trial 
began, no settlement would be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Both parties appeared close to a settlement last month when the supervisors 
agreed to put Schabarum in a new, predominantly Latino district. The compromise 
fell apart, however, when a counterproposal to increase Latino voters in 
Schabarum's district was rejected by the board. 
</P>
<P>
The last chance for an out-of-court settlement appeared lost Tuesday when the 
board voted down a proposal to expand from five to seven members.

HERE LIES SKIPPY; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY DOG -- ALLEGEDLY SHOT BY MAILMAN -- IS BURIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cradled in a white plastic casket lined with silky orange cloth and attended by 
his grieving owners, Skippy, the dog allegedly shot to death by an annoyed 
postman, was buried Wednesday in a Calabasas pet cemetery, surrounded by TV 
cameras, reporters and the graves of other famous animals. 
</P>
<P>
The Brody family of Arleta said goodby to Skippy with a $685 funeral paid for 
by the Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
"This leaves us with a happy memory of the dog, rather than an unhappy one as 
of last Tuesday," said Tammie Brody, 27. 
</P>
<P>
Brody and her son, Brian, 10, witnessed the shooting of the family dog the day 
after Christmas as Brody was about to give mailman Floyd Bertran Sterling his 
Christmas present, a bottle of vodka. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, who was arrested, told police the dog had bitten him earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Wednesday that an autopsy indicated Skippy may have been 
shot while fleeing from the postman. 
</P>
<P>
Skippy, a 2-year-old German shepherd mix, was buried in a plot bordered by 
poinsettias and surrounded by trees at Los Angeles Pet Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
Before the burial, eight members of the Brody family gathered in a shed to view 
the body of the stray dog they had adopted. 
</P>
<P>
Tammie Brody placed three red roses in the open casket. 
</P>
<P>
There was no eulogy. Brian Brody stood tearless and mute, flanked by his 
grandparents and best friend, as the casket was lowered into the ground. Family 
members walked quietly back to their car amid a swarm of cameras and 
questioning reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel OK," Brian said. "I don't want another dog." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, 34, was freed Tuesday on $5,000 bail after he surrendered to 
authorities. He faces arraignment Jan. 23 in San Fernando Municipal Court on 
one count each of cruelty to animals, carrying a concealed weapon and 
discharging a firearm with gross negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Family members said they had not yet seen a report on the autopsy, performed at 
their request by a private veterinarian. However, Brody insisted to reporters 
that "Skippy was not attacking" when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
Police and district attorney's investigators appeared to confirm her account. 
They said Wednesday that the autopsy indicated the fatal shot struck the dog in 
the left side from the rear, indicating that Skippy was facing away from the 
gun when he was hit. 
</P>
<P>
The cemetery, at the western end of the San Fernando Valley, is the resting 
place for some 40,000 animals, including pets belonging to such past and 
present celebrities as Rudolph Valentino, William Shatner, Gloria Swanson and 
Sally Struthers. 
</P>
<P>
Skippy's tombstone was not ready Wednesday. Brody said family members were 
still undecided on what it will say, but favor an inscription reading: "We Love 
You and Miss You Very Much."

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE DELAYS DECISION ON CITYHOOD FOR MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A judge on Wednesday decided to hear additional arguments Jan. 16 in a lawsuit 
filed by Malibu cityhood supporters, who want to force the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors to set an incorporation election in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs had indicated earlier that she might rule 
in the case this week. 
</P>
<P>
However, she decided to continue the matter after a lawyer for cityhood backers 
submitted additional briefs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Incorporation advocates have accused the supervisors of violating a state law 
that allows them 60 days from when they began hearing the cityhood matter to 
conclude the hearing as a final step before setting an election. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors began the hearing Oct. 19, but later voted to indefinitely 
postpone a decision on incorporation until construction permits are issued for 
a sewer system the county wants to build in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit asks the judge to force the supervisors to finish the hearing, 
which would clear the way for them to set an election in April or June.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COURT TOLD GARY COLEMAN CAN MANAGE HIS ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawyers for actor Gary Coleman, the former pint-sized co-star of TV's 
"Diff'rent Strokes," argued in court papers Wednesday that Coleman can manage 
his multimillion-dollar estate and is in good health. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Martha Goldin, meanwhile, continued a hearing 
that had been requested by the actor's mother, Edmonia Sue Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
The latter is asking the court to appoint conservators to care for her son and 
manage his finances. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman argued in her petition that her son's prolonged kidney problems have 
had a debilitating effect on him and that he is no longer able to manage his 
own estate, which includes about $6 million in personal property and an annual 
gross income of $750,000 from that property. 
</P>
<P>
But in court papers filed in opposition to the petition, attorney Barry Mallen 
said, "Edmonia Sue Coleman's petition is no more than an attempt . . . to wrest 
control of Gary Coleman's personal and financial affairs away from him as a 
defensive tactic in connection with a civil lawsuit brought by Gary Coleman 
against W.G. Coleman and Edmonia Sue Coleman, his former personal managers and 
his former business managers." 
</P>
<P>
Goldin said she wanted to give court-appointed attorney Arne Lindgren a chance 
to talk to the 21-year-old actor and his doctors before the judge decides if 
there is a basis to proceed with a conservator hearing or jury trial.

METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW JURORS ASKED TO SOLVE SLAYING 'PUZZLE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About four months after jurors deadlocked in the trial of a British national 
accused of killing a family of four, a prosecutor today asked a new panel to 
piece together a "jigsaw puzzle" of circumstantial evidence and convict the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 31, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of 
convicting Harvey Rader on four counts of murder stemming from the Oct. 12, 
1982, disappearance of the Saloman family of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The bodies of Sol Saloman, his wife, Elaine, and their two children, Michalle, 
15, and Mitchell, 9, have never been found. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors contend that Rader, 49, a Reseda used-car dealer, killed the family 
because of a business dispute with Sol Saloman, who owned a fire extinguisher 
company. Rader, however, has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence.

COUNCIL TO SUE STATE OVER JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
PRISON: THE MOVE IS AN ATTEMPT TO BLOCK CONSTRUCTION OF THE FACILITY IN EAST 
LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to sue the California 
Department of Corrections in an attempt to bar construction of a state prison 
on the edge of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, sponsored by Councilwoman Gloria Molina, directs the city 
attorney's office to immediately file a lawsuit against the state. Molina and 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who represent districts near the site, have 
staunchly opposed the prison proposal, arguing that the downtown area already 
has a high concentration of county jails and city lockups. 
</P>
<P>
Molina said Wednesday that the state "violated all the selection processes any 
other state prison has ever undergone." 
</P>
<P>
East Los Angeles is a poor part of the city, she said, that was selected as a 
prison site on the basis of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"In this instance it was just a political job as compared to an appropriate 
siting following all the criteria," Molina said. "There were many sites that we 
pointed to that were more appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
The city attorney's office will file a suit challenging the adequacy of the 
environmental impact report next week, according to Assistant City Atty. 
William Waterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
The report failed to take into account the "visual impact" of the huge facility 
and contained insufficient measures to mitigate traffic problems that will be 
created, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit will also attack the plan as an "arbitrary and capricious" 
administrative action as well as a waste of taxpayers' money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The $147-million facility will cost 20% to 30% more than it should because of 
its design and because it will be built in an urban area where costs are high, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The council decision to sue comes after five years of bitter controversy in 
Sacramento and anger in East Los Angeles where the prison is to be built. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, state officials gave final approval for construction of the 
1,450-bed, medium-security facility on 20 acres of industrial land near 
Washington Boulevard and Santa Fe Avenue. State officials have predicted that 
construction could begin on the site as early as this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The location was first proposed in 1985 by Gov. George Deukmejian, who argued 
that while Los Angeles County accounts for 40% of state prison inmates, it has 
no state prison. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Los Angeles prison is tied to a similar facility planned for 
Lancaster. The two projects were linked in Sacramento after Democratic 
lawmakers from Los Angeles complained that Republican constituents in rural 
parts of the county ought to accept an equal share of the prison burden. 
</P>
<P>
Under a legislative compromise, neither prison could be occupied until 
construction is begun on the other. 
</P>
<P>
But the fate of both prisons has become less certain in recent days. On 
Tuesday, the Lancaster City Council voted unanimously to file a lawsuit 
challenging the validity of the environmental study on the Lancaster site, 
approved last week by the state Department of Corrections.

BRAUDE FILES UNUSUAL SUIT TO BLOCK DOWNTOWN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude filed suit Wednesday to block 
construction of the huge Watt City Center, a two-tower office and retail 
complex that is to be built between 7th and 8th streets downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Braude, alone among council members, has crusaded against the $600-million 
project, asserting that it will bring total gridlock to the nearby Harbor 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the development in a 14-1 vote last month, with Braude 
voting against it. The project was shepherded through the council by Arthur K. 
Snyder, an influential lobbyist and former councilman, who represented Watt 
&amp; Marselis, the developers. 
</P>
<P>
Braude refused to discuss the lawsuit Wednesday, saying he preferred to answer 
questions at a press conference today. 
</P>
<P>
Braude filed the unusual suit in Superior Court Wednesday, not as a member of 
the City Council, but as an individual, a taxpayer, a resident of the city and 
a user of the Harbor Freeway, according to his attorney, George Dale. 
</P>
<P>
Dale asked that the court bring the project to an immediate halt by issuing a 
stay of action on its requests for building permits. 
</P>
<P>
However, Superior Court Judge David Jaffe denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
But Jaffe also refused to throw out the lawsuit at the request of attorneys for 
the developers, who argued that Braude had no legal standing to sue. 
</P>
<P>
Braude is challenging the project on several legal grounds, including the 
contention that the council vote to approve it was based on insufficient 
evidence about the impact of the traffic that the development will generate.

A college student was shot to death on New Year's Eve in his family home in 
Agoura Hills and his younger brother has disappeared, authorities reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bullet-riddled body of Michael Minkoff, 20, an engineering student at 
Moorpark College, was found about 11:30 a.m. Sunday on the kitchen floor of the 
house in the 28900 block of Dargan Street, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy 
Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim's brother, Bradley, 18, is missing, along with the family's Volvo, 
the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives want to question the younger brother about the shooting, but they 
have not ruled out the possibility that he could be a victim as well, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always been sibling rivalry" between the two brothers, Sgt. Bill 
Gaynor said, "but I don't know there was enough to kill." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said they found no weapons and there was no indication of forced 
entry into the home. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Minkoff's body was found by deputies sent to the one-story stucco home 
in response to a 911 call that apparently was placed by the victim, Gaynor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't say anything," Gaynor said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the address of the location from which a 911 call is made appears on a 
monitor screen at the dispatch office, the sergeant said. When deputies 
arrived, the phone was off the hook, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Gaynor said neighbors did not report hearing or seeing anything unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The parents, Barbara and David Minkoff, were vacationing in Mexico. They were 
told of the shooting by deputies who met them as they arrived late Sunday at 
Los Angeles International Airport, Gaynor said.

GM UNVEILS AN ADVANCED ELECTRIC PASSENGER CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
General Motors Corp., hoping to steal a lead in the race to develop 
lower-emissions vehicles, Wednesday unveiled a prototype electric passenger car 
that can go 124 miles on a single charge and even outrace some internal 
combustion vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The Impact, a teardrop-shaped two-seat car, has a top speed of 75 m.p.h. and 
would place GM "on the cutting edge of technology," GM Chairman Roger B. Smith 
said at a news conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The sleek car, powered by 32 10-volt lead-acid batteries, was designed from the 
ground up as a practical electric car for the consumer market, Smith said. In 
that, it differs from other electrical vehicles under development, which are 
essentially converted delivery vans intended for commercial fleets. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the Impact is "producible" as currently designed, although 
production will depend on its meeting federal safety standards, consumer 
acceptance of an electric car and financial feasibility. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no yet-to-be-solved secrets," Smith said. "The thing is its 
marketability . . . . We want an electric car that's producible, that can 
handle itself on the highway and that can meet the federal standards out there 
and that is a marketable product. We believe we've accomplished two-thirds of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
The soonest that GM would go into production is 1993 or 1994, said John S. 
Zwerner, executive director of GM's advanced product engineering department. 
</P>
<P>
"The public generally perceives electric vehicles as slow-moving golf carts," 
Zwerner said. "The Impact absolutely shatters that perception." 
</P>
<P>
Observers, including state and local air quality officials, praised the new 
car, which was designed and engineered mainly in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"This is certainly as advanced as anything I'm aware of," said Arnold Fickett, 
a vice president of the nonprofit Electric Power Research Institute, funded by 
the electrical utility industry. "It's a giant step forward." 
</P>
<P>
GM engineers borrowed from a prototype GM solar vehicle, the Sunraycer, to give 
the Impact a lightweight, aerodynamic design and improvements in motor and 
controls that partly account for the car's range, speed and acceleration: 0 to 
60 m.p.h. in 8 seconds. A GM video showed the Impact out-accelerating Mazda 
Miata and Nissan 300ZX sports cars. 
</P>
<P>
GM said it uses about a third of the energy of a conventional car. 
</P>
<P>
Smith refused to estimate how much the car would cost if it went into 
production, except to say that it would be priced competitively with other 
cars. He refused also to say how much GM spent developing it. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry observers said they do not see a big consumer demand for the 
cars, short of federal or state requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, in a free market situation, with no market incentives, electrically 
powered cars would have no impact," said Chris Cedergren, a senior automotive 
analyst with J. D. Power &amp; Associates, an Agoura Hills auto market research 
firm. "They would have to be forced on consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Smith admitted that the car has drawbacks. For one thing, at current gasoline 
prices and electricity rates, the car would cost about twice as much to operate 
as a conventional auto: about $70 a month, compared to $40 a month for a 
gasoline-engine auto driven 10,000 miles a year. 
</P>
<P>
That is mainly because of the batteries' relatively short life. An Impact owner 
would need to replace the battery pack every 20,000 miles at a cost of roughly 
$1,500. The electricity to run the car would cost about $5 to $12 a month, 
Smith added. 
</P>
<P>
Expected improvements in battery design in the next three to four years could 
extend battery life to 50,000 miles, which would make monthly operating costs 
competitive with those of conventional autos, Smith added. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike electric vehicles that use exotic nickel-iron or sodium-sulfur batteries 
as power sources, the Impact uses lead-acid batteries, whose 870 pounds account 
for about 30% of the car's total weight. 
</P>
<P>
But improvements in battery design eliminate the need to add water and also 
overcome some of the traditional drawbacks of electric vehicles: low speed, 
short range and the relatively long time it takes to recharge. 
</P>
<P>
The average electric vehicle now has a top speed of 50 to 70 m.p.h. and a range 
of 60 to 100 miles. It typically takes up to 12 hours to recharge an existing 
electric vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
But GM said the Impact can be charged halfway in as little as half an hour and 
almost fully recharged in six, simply by plugging the vehicle into a home 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Smith said, he foresees recharging circuits being placed around 
cities, much as some Canadian cities put outlets at parking meters to power 
engine warmers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Impact is designed as a consumer car rather than as a fleet 
vehicle, it would have a much broader market than electric vans -- a necessity 
for mass production of a new vehicle, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
GM would have to sell more than 100,000 Impacts a year to make production 
feasible. The market for vans converted to electric power from gasoline engines 
may be fewer than 20,000 a year, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed federal and local clean air standards may spur acceptance of electric 
vehicles generally because they are virtually pollution-free. 
</P>
<P>
The California Air Resources Board is considering a proposal to require that 
15% of new vehicles sold by the year 2003 be so-called ultra-low-emission 
vehicles, which would include electrics. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely a need for alternative fuels, and this shows that the kind 
of standards that the Air Resources Board is working on are feasible and 
realistic," said Bill Sessa, a spokesman for the California Air Resources 
Board. "It's consistent with the kinds of emissions standards that we are 
developing for the future." 
</P>
<P>
Electric vehicles would, in effect, transfer pollution from cars to the power 
plants that produce the electricity for the vehicles. But that would still 
result in pollution reductions of up to 90%, said Tom Eichhorn, a spokesman for 
the South Coast Air Management District, because of greater efficiency at the 
power plants. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that new power plants would need to be built, at least in the 
near future, to meet demand from such vehicles. Electrical utilities such as 
Southern California Edison have enough excess capacity to power electrical 
vehicles, especially if most recharging occurs at night -- typically a 
utility's period of lowest usage, said Lawrence Hamlin, manager of research at 
Edison. 
</P>
<P>
GM is not the only company working on electric vehicles. The Electric Power 
Research Institute has worked with both GM and Chrysler to develop 
electric-powered vans for eventual production. Ford Motor Co. is developing its 
own electric-powered van.

TRW, MOTOROLA UNVEIL NEW FAST, HIGH-POWERED CHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRW Inc. and Motorola Corp. on Wednesday unveiled a 4.4-square-inch, 1.5-ounce 
computer chip with the computational power of a supercomputer the size of an 
entire room. 
</P>
<P>
Although the device, called the CPUAX SuperChip, is initially intended for 
military duty, analysts said the technology design and manufacturing know-how 
that went into the chip would soon trickle down into the U.S. commercial 
electronics market. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that there is still some technology leadership left in the U.S.," 
said Jim Feldhan, an analyst with In-Stat Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz., 
semiconductor market research firm. "It shows that some companies still know 
how to design, manufacture and produce advanced semiconductors." 
</P>
<P>
The chip was developed under a $75-million Defense Department grant whose 
objective, in part, was to spur advances in the U.S. semiconductor industry. In 
recent years, the industry has fallen behind that of the Japanese, leaving the 
Pentagon, among others, dependent on Japanese chip makers for key parts. That's 
a position the military has found dangerous and frightening. 
</P>
<P>
The chip unveiled Wednesday contains 4 million devices, each half a micron 
wide. (A micron is a millionth of a meter.) In addition, the chip can perform 
200 million mathematical calculations per second. 
</P>
<P>
"Two hundred million operations per second mean the CPUAX is the computational 
equivalent of some supercomputers that fill an entire room, require elaborate 
refrigeration systems and weigh several tons," said Thomas A. Zimmerman, 
director of the TRW program under which the chip was developed. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the device, when paired with a companion chip, can repair its own 
flaws by itself, an achievement TRW said was an industry first. 
</P>
<P>
The chip was manufactured in limited quantities by Motorola at its Advanced 
Products Research and Development Laboratory in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
TRW said initial applications for the chip would be as the central brain of an 
advanced spacecraft or in the noses of jet fighters or missiles. Commercial 
successors of the device would include applications where high speed, small 
size and great computing power and reliability are needed, including 
computer-aided design, medical diagnosis, plant process control and complex 
imaging.

S&amp;L AGENCY TO SELL REAL ESTATE ASSETS AT 'MEASURED PACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
The sale of billions of dollars in real estate from defunct savings and loan 
associations may take several years, preventing any dumping of properties that 
might depress local markets, federal officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The government will dispose of real estate assets "at a measured pace," said 
Daniel P. Kearney, president of the federal Oversight Board, which on Wednesday 
issued its strategic plan for handling the financial cleanup of hundreds of 
crippled S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Kearney's plan provides an operating blueprint for the Resolution Trust Corp., 
which controls 281 ailing S&amp;Ls with $104 billion in assets. The Oversight 
Board sets policy for the RTC, an agency created last year to manage asset 
sales of failed thrifts. About 25% of the assets are in Texas, which suffered 
the largest number of S&amp;L failures. 
</P>
<P>
Kearney's statements represented the government's first formal acknowledgement 
of the pace at which it will sell real estate assets. Real estate experts and 
others nationwide have expressed concerns that the government, anxious to 
dispose of the assets as quickly as possible, might go too fast and 
dramatically disturb already depressed local real estate markets. 
</P>
<P>
The assets available for sale "range from cash to mortgage-backed securities to 
houses to Pizza Hut parlors," Kearney said. Mortgage loans and securities 
backed by mortgages can be sold relatively quickly to investors because the 
market for these products is "extremely large," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the real estate -- office buildings, single-family homes, shopping centers 
and stores, condominiums and unimproved land -- may take much longer even if 
the government moves "with all deliberate speed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Legal problems connected to the real estate "will necessitate a lengthy period 
of real estate asset sales stretching over several years," Kearney said. "When 
the RTC has an asset ready for sale, it should offer it for sale -- at a 
measured pace." 
</P>
<P>
The RTC issued its first inventory list Tuesday, a massive compilation of 
30,000 properties covering nearly 3,000 pages. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate assets make up about $45 billion to $50 billion of the assets at 
the 281 S&amp;Ls under government control. An additional 200 institutions are 
having financial difficulties and are likely targets for government takeover. 
This would add billions of dollars more to the tally of real estate properties 
that will eventually be sold by the government. 
</P>
<P>
"The task facing the RTC for asset disposition is unprecedented in magnitude 
and complexity," Kearney noted. The tally of 30,000 pieces of real estate "does 
not take into account mortgage loans, servicing rights or securities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The strategic plan directs the RTC to "rely heavily on the private sector" in 
disposing of financial and real estate assets, the Oversight Board said in its 
summary description of the plan. Real estate agents, auctioneers and other 
business persons would be involved in helping dispose of assets. 
</P>
<P>
"Contractors should be given incentives to generate the best possible return on 
assets, but RTC should develop measures that discourage contractors from 
speculating by holding properties too long," the Oversight Board said. 
</P>
<P>
The strategic plan says the government should move quickly to stem the 
continuing financial losses at the S&amp;Ls under its control. The RTC was 
given a deadline of Jan. 15 to develop a system to measure "the rate of 
deterioration of each insolvent institution and the financial risk each poses 
to the government," the Oversight Board said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the RTC should develop standards to decide which institutions to target 
for immediate shut-down or sale. The RTC has $50 billion to dispose of failed 
institutions, either by paying off depositors, whose accounts are insured up to 
$100,000, or finding outside investors to buy the institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Under the strategic plan, the RTC would be permitted to offer capital to some 
prospective buyers to finance their purchases of defunct S&amp;Ls. This drew 
sharp criticism from Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of a special House 
Banking Committee task force dealing with oversight of the S&amp;L cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of S&amp;Ls "should be subject to a market test," with prospective 
buyers arranging their own financing, Vento said. The RTC "should not gamble 
with the taxpayers' money," Vento said. He also expressed concern that the 
Oversight Board did not provide details of policies dealing with possible 
conflicts of interests among persons dealing with the RTC.

Wells Fargo Appeals Lien: The San Francisco-based bank appealed in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles for relief from a statewide lien on its real 
estate holdings obtained by Ted Hays, a 78-year-old former developer. 
</P>
<P>
Hays recently won a $700,000-judgment against the bank for a mistake that Hays 
said ruined his business. Wells Fargo claimed that it was exempt from a 
requirement to post a bond while it appealed the Superior Court judgment, 
prompting Hays to seek the lien. A hearing is scheduled in federal court today 
on the bank's request to lift the lien, which prevents Wells Fargo from selling 
any of the affected properties.

Thrift's Actions Restricted: Santa Barbara Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the main 
thrift subsidiary of Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara, said federal regulators 
had placed severe restrictions on its operations. Financial Corp. Chairman 
Philip Brinkerhoff said the restrictions had been imposed because the thrift is 
undercapitalized under federal standards. The Office of Thrift Supervision has 
prohibited the thrift from all new lending and investment activity, accepting 
uninsured deposits or paying dividends on its stock.

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed merger of troubled CenTrust Bank with a bank owned by a billionaire 
cruise ship magnate was announced Wednesday as part of a plan to ward off 
regulators from the Miami savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
The non-binding agreement calls for CenTrust and Ensign Bank to begin talks to 
reorganize under a new holding company. 
</P>
<P>
The merger would include a cash infusion from Ensign's parent, Hamilton Holding 
Co., which is controlled by Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. principal owner Ted 
Arison. 
</P>
<P>
The merger hinges on several conditions, including federal approval of 
CenTrust's plans to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank of Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, federal thrift regulators placed severe restrictions 
on the operations of Santa Barbara Savings &amp; Loan Assn., the main thrift 
subsidiary of Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara. Financial Corp. said the 
restrictions were imposed because the thrift is undercapitalized under federal 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions prohibit the thrift from all new lending and investment 
activity, accepting uninsured deposits or paying dividends on its stock.

CBS Lawsuit Settlement OKd: A federal judge approved a $6-million settlement of 
a suit filed by a CBS shareholder who claimed the firm that owns the CBS 
television network was mismanaged from 1983 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit was brought in 1986 by Roger Minkoff, a real estate investor from 
St. Croix, Virgin Islands, who owns 12 CBS shares. The settlement, in which CBS 
Inc. management admits no wrongdoing, will be paid by a corporate insurance 
policy. It was reached Nov. 28. Of the settlement, $4.5 million will go to the 
CBS treasury for an indirect benefit to shareholders. The remaining $1.5 
million will go to Minkoff's attorney. Minkoff will receive $15,000 from the 
attorney's portion.

Tax Burden Shifts: The share of federal income taxes paid by higher-income 
taxpayers has increased since 1981, while the share paid by lower-income 
taxpayers has decreased, the Treasury Department said. The share of federal 
income taxes paid by the lower 95% of all taxpayers in terms of income fell to 
56.8% in 1987 from 64.6% in 1981, while the share paid by the top 5% of all 
taxpayers increased to 43.2% in 1987 from 35.4% in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury noted that the share of federal personal income taxes paid by the 
top 1% of taxpayers in terms of income was 24.8% in 1987, up from a 17.9% share 
paid in 1981. The figures are based on data from 1987 income tax returns.

Wall Street stocks managed only a meek follow-through Wednesday to the previous 
day's record highs, closing mixed after a day of seesaw trading. Blue chips 
were slightly lower, but the broader market finished mostly higher. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said Tuesday's rally left the market ripe for profit takers, and those 
skeptical of the quality of the rally continued to sit out the session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed down 0.42 at 2,809.73 after gaining 56.95 
Tuesday to close above the 2,800 level for the first time. New York Stock 
Exchange volume was 192.3 million shares, compared to 162.1 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the broader market, which did not rise as sharply Tuesday, 878 stocks moved 
higher and 725 declined. 
</P>
<P>
A number of traders said institutional buyers were largely absent from the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like they are still trying to sort out what their game plan is for 
1990," said Anthony Woodruff, head trader at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, analysts were mostly pleased by the day's performance. "It's 
positive that the gains are still kept," said A. C. Moore, director of research 
at Argus Research. "It was an opportune time for traders to sell into the 
gains." 
</P>
<P>
Shares of several technology stocks, which helped support Tuesday's rally, 
continued stronger. International Business Machines Corp. rose 7/8 to 98 7/8, 
Digital Equipment Corp. added 1 3/4 to 85 7/8, Apple Computer rose 1/4 to 37 
1/2, Microsoft was ahead 1/2 to 89 1/4 and Compaq rose 1 3/4 to 84 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Takeover speculation sent Paramount Communications Inc. stock sharply higher 
and CBS Inc. shares lower as unconfirmed rumors surfaced that CBS was about to 
bid for the entertainment and publishing giant. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount stock rose 1 1/2 to 52 3/8 a share in New York Stock Exchange 
composite trading; CBS tumbled 2 3/4 to 184 a share. 
</P>
<P>
CBS spokeswoman Ann Morfogen denied that her company was about to bid for 
Paramount, saying, "It's not true. It's a rumor." 
</P>
<P>
Gerber Products fell 5/8 to 46 3/4 after news that its chairman, David Johnson, 
will depart to head Campbell Soup. Campbell fell 3/4 to 54 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
UAL dropped 7 3/4 to 162 3/4 on the belief that no new buyout deal is imminent, 
arbitragers said. 
</P>
<P>
In London, shares ended at an all-time high, helped by Wall Street's record 
close Tuesday in the Dow Jones industrials. The Financial Times 100-share index 
rose 29.6 to 2,463.7, passing the previous closing high of 2,443.4 set on July 
16, 1987, three months before the Black Monday world stocks crash.

Bond Prices Fall on Home Sales Report 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices declined Wednesday as the government reported robust sales of new 
homes in November, another sign of healthy economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/8 point, or $3.75 per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield climbed to 8.03% from 7.99% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales of new homes surged 9.6% in November, the 
steepest gain in four months. Analysts said the report threw water on recent 
talk of a real estate industry slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
Since long-term fixed-income investments such as bonds are considered a safe 
haven during periods of economic sluggishness, prices tend to decline after 
positive economic news. 
</P>
<P>
A sharp rise in crude oil and other commodities prices, which triggered 
inflation fears, also spurred some bond selling Wednesday, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
The main piece of evidence expected to move the bond market is Friday's 
government report on employment for December, and some economists are 
forecasting a healthy addition of 220,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 8.3125%, down from 8.50% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Mixed but Firmer Overseas 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended mixed Wednesday against major foreign currencies after firming 
overseas amid reported efforts by the Bank of Japan to drive it down. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices slipped in New York and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery 
settled at $394 an ounce, down $5.60 from Tuesday. Republic National Bank in 
New York quoted a late bid for gold at $394.35, off $5.40. 
</P>
<P>
Earl I. Johnson, a trader at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said technical 
factors were largely responsible for the dollar's movements. But he said 
trading remained thin as a number of dealers extended their long New Year's 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the New Year's holiday continued with markets closed Wednesday. The 
dollar was quoted in London at 145.70 yen, compared to Tuesday's 144.09. In New 
York, the dollar stood at 145.25 yen, down from 146.40 Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling dropped to $1.6080 in 
London from $1.6115 late Tuesday and rose to $1.6115 from $1.6085 in New York. 
</P>

Gold Futures Below $400 an Ounce 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures prices fell decisively below $400 an ounce in trading marked by an 
absence of buyers from Far Eastern markets, which were closed for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, sugar, energy and orange juice futures all climbed 
sharply; livestock and meat futures were mixed, and grains and soybeans 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Gold futures settled $5.60 to $5.80 lower on New York's Commodity Exchange with 
the contract for delivery in February down $5.70 at $396.40 an ounce, the 
lowest close since Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Silver futures ended 2.9 to 3.3 cents lower, with March at $5.22 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on talk 
that Mexico had bought a large amount of sugar and that the United States is 
likely to increase sugar imports as a result of frost damage to sugar cane in 
Mexico and Florida over the Christmas weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures settled 0.50 cent to 1.20 cents higher, with March at 14.22 cents 
a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures continued to soar on supply concerns before the American 
Petroleum Institute's weekly inventory report. The report, released after the 
close, showed larger-than-expected declines in U.S. stocks of unleaded gasoline 
and petroleum distillates, including heating oil. Crude oil stocks were down 
slightly and near expectations. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished 11 to 79 cents higher, with February 
at $23.68 a barrel; heating oil was 0.81 cent to 1.47 cents higher, with 
February at 78.20 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 1.50 to 1.76 cents 
higher, with February at 67.23 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
Orange juice futures soared for the sixth straight day on the New York Cotton 
Exchange amid supply fears linked to the Christmastime freeze in the Florida 
citrus belt and the continuing suspension of orange juice exports from Brazil, 
which halted shipments last week while it assesses the damage in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Orange juice futures finished 1.8 to 8 cents higher, with January at $1.7205 a 
pound.

NEW HOME SALES SOAR 9.6%; RATE DROP CITED

New home sales jumped 9.6% in November, their fastest gain in four months, the 
government said Wednesday. Analysts said the housing industry continues to be 
aided by lower mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that when mortgage rates are at relatively affordable levels, buyers 
will be buying homes," said Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal 
National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Assn. of Home Builders, agreed 
that the report shows "consumers are responding to lower interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
But Carliner added that many home builders are concerned whether rates will 
remain at low levels this year, saying that "in the five years I've been here, 
I've never seen them so nervous." 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said new, single-family homes were sold at a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 710,000 units in November after a revised 0.9% gain the 
month before. October sales originally were reported down 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sharpest surge since a 14.1% advance last July. 
</P>
<P>
"This certainly should take some of the wind out of stories that the housing 
market is about to collapse," said economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage 
Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Peach noted that in addition to new home sales, sales of existing houses also 
hit a fairly good pace in November and that housing starts, "while not rising 
like gangbusters," are improving. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, including Carliner and Obrinsky, saw the possibility of slightly 
higher mortgage interest rates this year as the Federal Reserve straddles a 
fine line of trying to keep inflation under control by restraining credit while 
not pushing the economy into a recession with high interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed began last June to let short-term rates drop gradually. Mortgage rates 
have fallen from an 11.22% peak to 9.74% at the end of November, according to 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, new home sales for the first 11 months of last year were down 
3.5% from the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The sharpest gain in new home sales in November occurred in the West, which 
posted a 29.9% advance. Analysts attributed much of the increase to a rebound 
from depressed sales after the Oct. 17 Bay Area Earthquake. October sales in 
the region had plummeted 21.6%. 
</P>
<P>
The Midwest also recorded strong sales, up 23.6%. Sales in the Northeast rose 
8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
The South had the only decline, a drop of 7.6%.

Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which has been trying to cut costs in a bid to boost 
flagging profits, said Wednesday that it has agreed to sell its entire Canadian 
retail securities business to Canadian brokerage Wood Gundy Inc. for 
undisclosed terms.

<P>
Merrill Lynch, the No. 1 U.S. securities firm, said the deal includes the 
transfer of its Canadian offices and work force as well as access to its U.S. 
research facilities.

Wood Gundy Chairman G. Edmund King told a press conference that the deal was

Merrill Lynch's retail sales force in Canada includes 264 registered 
representatives and 156 managerial and sales support personnel, as well as 265

LATINO-OWNED BANK PROJECT IS CANCELED; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: ORGANIZERS SAID THEY FELL $1.4 MILLION SHORT OF THEIR GOAL TO RAISE $4 
MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Amid a generally robust climate for bank startups, an East Los Angeles group 
has shelved plans to open California's fifth Latino-owned bank after failing to 
raise enough funds for the widely publicized, grass-roots venture. 
</P>
<P>
The setback comes amid stepped-up efforts by consumer activist groups to 
pressure banks to expand services in ethnic urban neighborhoods, such as East 
Los Angeles, which have long complained about being under-served by lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of Angeles National Bank said they fell $1.4 million short of their 
goal to raise $4 million to open the bank in a converted auto dealership on 
Atlantic Boulevard and Eagle Street. The group scrapped its plans after an 
extensive 18-month, grass-roots fund-raising effort that sought contributions 
as small as $1,000 from individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
"Our stock offering did not generate the required amount of capital in the 
prescribed period of time," explained James E. Roberts, an organizer and former 
Crocker Bank executive who was to head Angeles National Bank. "The general 
public is the big loser. They would have had their own bank. The Latino market 
is underestimated and under-served. Our bank would have gone after" that 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Although California has the nation's largest concentration of Latinos, it is 
home to only four Latino-owned banks, the same as New York, but behind Texas 
with 13 and Florida with 7, according to the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
The growth of Latino-owned banks in California has been thwarted by strong 
promotional efforts by major banks such as Bank of America, which has many 
branches throughout Latin America, said Gonzalo Fernandez, senior vice 
president for City National Bank in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts said Angeles National Bank's escrow agent this month will begin 
refunding money to more than 100 investors. Meanwhile, Roberts and several 
others say they are studying the possibility of buying an existing bank and 
opening a branch in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, last year was one of the best years for new bank startups in 
California as well as for the establishment of new Latino-owned banks. 
</P>
<P>
Ten applications for new state chartered banks were approved last year in 
California, compared to two in 1988, according to the California Banking 
Department. Meanwhile, the number of Latino-owned banks nationwide grew to 34 
as of September, 1989, from 27 a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
However, Roberts said negative media coverage of the nation's savings and loan 
crisis as well as investor skittishness in the wake of October's stock market 
mini-crash cooled interest in Angeles National Bank before the expiration of a 
Dec. 17 deadline for raising the required start-up capital. 
</P>
<P>
Under rules established by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which 
regulates national banks, organizers of a new bank have 18 months to raise 
money for the venture. Roberts and a group of about half a dozen other Latino 
business executives in Los Angeles announced the formation of Angeles National 
Bank in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
With legal fees, building rental and salaries running $250,000 or more per 
year, setting up a new bank can be costly. The minimum amount of money to 
completely capitalize a bank varies, but in recent years the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency has been requiring a minimum of $4 million to 
establish banks in urban areas, experts say.

TRUMP NOW IN BUSINESS WITH CARD MAKER HE SUED

<P>
Developer Donald J. Trump, whose lawyers often are busy fighting unauthorized 
attempts to use his name, has agreed to endorse a line of photographic business 
cards made by a small Georgia company that he had sued for calling the product 
"Trump Cards." 
</P>
<P>
Under an out-of-court settlement announced Wednesday, Trump was given the 
rights to the "Trump Cards" trademark and will license Positive Concepts Ltd. 
of Lithia Springs, Ga., to market the product. 
</P>
<P>
Trump will receive a monthly royalty. 
</P>
<P>
Trump agreed to drop his suit against PCL, a suburban Atlanta company that 
began making the cards in 1983. The company, whose trademark application last 
year prompted Trump's lawsuit, contends that it named its product for the 
high-ranking suit in a card game. 
</P>
<P>
PCL President Edward A. Zito said Wednesday that the settlement was good for 
both sides. He said his company avoided a potentially lengthy and expensive 
court battle and got an unusual endorsement from Trump that should boost the 
fortunes of his business. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisements featuring Trump's endorsement will begin appearing in national 
business magazines this spring, Zito said. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Zito nor Joe Silver, a spokesman for the Trump Organization in New 
York, would say how much money Trump would receive in royalties. 
</P>
<P>
Zito said the path to the settlement began last summer when he called Trump to 
discuss the suit. 
</P>
<P>
"He was cordial but stood his ground," Zito said. "I said, 'You know, we didn't 
try to steal your name from you. In 1983, nobody knew of you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Zito said he sent Trump a sample of the cards and suggested that the issue be 
settled out of court. Trump liked the cards, Zito said, and negotiations began.

HOT INTERVIEW: The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, above, the Anaheim-based crusader for 
"traditional values" and a well-known foe of gay rights measures, is the 
subject of a major piece in Los Angeles magazine. . . . In the article, 
entitled "Son of Falwell," Sheldon says he wants to create "a movement, not an 
organization" and asserts that "I am the inspiration and prophet" of that 
movement. . . . Much space is devoted to Sheldon's personal sexual experiences, 
including at least two approaches by homosexuals. . . . Sheldon said he was 
shocked by the way the piece was edited, calling it "a poor attempt to distort 
my values and beliefs. The true Rev. Lou Sheldon did not come forth in that

Canadian mountain climber Pascall Vieau, missing for a week, was found dead on 
the Nevado del Tolima mountain by the Colombian Red Cross, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Vieau, 22, died when he fell off the icy slope into an abyss, press reports 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vieau had begun the climb with four Colombian mountaineers, but on Dec. 27 he 
decided to continue alone to the peak, a Red Cross spokesman said. The 
Canadian's body was found Tuesday, 12,210 feet above sea level at La Cueva, on 
the 17,210-foot-high, snowcapped mountain.

BOARD MOVES TO PULL LICENSE OF ALLERGIST 
</P>

State medical authorities have moved to revoke the license of a Canoga Park 
doctor who treated as many as 6,000 allergy patients -- including about 2,000 
at a clinic in Anaheim -- by injecting them with their own urine. The practice 
represents an "extreme departure from the standard of care in California," 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Jorge R. Borrell has appealed the revocation order, and a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge last month temporarily blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
In a harshly worded order to cancel Borrell's license last month, the state 
Board of Medical Quality Assurance said Borrell, who operates clinics in Canoga 
Park and Anaheim, exhibited a "shocking and extreme" lack of medical knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 patients of the Allergy Control Medical Group in Anaheim 
received the injections since the facility first opened about 12 years ago, 
Borrell said in an interview Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Board officials said Borrell, 69, failed to test patients to see whether they 
were injured or endangered by his treatments and failed to keep proper medical 
records on them. 
</P>
<P>
He received his medical training in Mexico and completed his residency in 
urology in the United States. Officials described Borrell as a self-taught 
allergist and immunologist, however. 
</P>
<P>
Borrell last month appealed the license revocation to Superior Court Judge 
Miriam A. Vogel, who temporarily blocked the state order pending a hearing in 
March to decide whether there is sufficient evidence exists to uphold it. The 
judge ordered Borrell to stop giving urine injections in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 patients getting the injections in Anaheim have had their treatments 
halted as a result, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
Borrell, who has a weekly radio talk show and who sells audiocassettes giving 
medical advice, Wednesday defended his urine treatments as a safe and effective 
"folk remedy" that has been practiced for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds kind of preposterous or ugly or dirty or whatever," he said. "Even 
though years ago a number of doctors used it here, they've been scared away." 
</P>
<P>
He said the treatment stimulates the immune system to produce allergy 
antibodies. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say urine injection is not a proven medical treatment for 
allergies. They said such injections can lead to infection, kidney failure, 
breathing difficulties and even death. 
</P>
<P>
"Common sense would tell you that if you went to a doctor and he said, 'I'm 
going to cure you by injecting urine,' you'd look at him and say goodby," said 
Phil Foster, regional supervisor for the state medical watchdog panel in the 
San Fernando Valley. "That would be the normal person's reaction. It's beyond 
my imagination how anyone could fall for that kind of quackery." 
</P>
<P>
Borrell said he has treated 5,000 to 6,000 patients with urine injections over 
a 12-year period. State officials said they had received only one complaint 
about him. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain it," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said none of Borrell's patients died or required hospitalization as a 
result of the treatments and that he is aware of only one patient who became 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
In legal documents, state authorities cite three patients given urine shots, 
one of whom received 13 injections. In each case, Borrell had told his patients 
that he was giving them urine injections. 
</P>
<P>
Borrell said that two or three patients developed infections from his 
treatments and that "that was before proper filters were available" for the 
urine. 
</P>
<P>
According to state legal documents, Borrell is medical director at two clinics 
operating under the name of Allergy Control Medical Group. In addition, he 
operates the private Advanced Testing Laboratory, where he refers patients for 
allergy testing. 
</P>
<P>
State authorities said the laboratory uses the cytotoxic leukocyte testing 
method, rather than skin tests, to determine which substances cause allergies 
in patients. The method involves combining a known allergen with blood to see 
whether it produces a lower white blood count indicating a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
But that testing method, officials said, has "no known scientific value or 
validity" and that it routinely results in false negative and false positive 
results.

DEBATERS TALK IT OUT, FAST AND FURIOUS

It was a war of words, a David versus Goliath struggle fought in a dusty 
classroom at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
But this time Goliath won. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four debate teams from universities across the nation participated in 
the 13th annual Winter in the Sun intercollegiate tournament here. The 
tournament, which began Tuesday, concludes today with an awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Participating universities included Harvard, the University of La Verne, Wake 
Forest, Illinois State, the U.S. Naval Academy, the University of Utah, the 
University of Texas and USC. 
</P>
<P>
During a preliminary round Tuesday, two students from Harvard squared off 
against two from underdog University of La Verne. The students sat at a desk 
behind a clutter of files and notes. Behind them were boxes filled with even 
more research. 
</P>
<P>
This was a grudge match of sorts for Harvard. La Verne had defeated Harvard 
last year in national debate competition, and Ivy Leaguer Sam Cooper, 21, a 
senior majoring in government, was out for revenge. "I never heard of La Verne 
before last year," he said. "We need this win." 
</P>
<P>
During the round, Cooper, wearing gold-rimmed glasses, a light button-down 
shirt and a navy blue-and-tan striped tie, gathered his notes and stood up 
slowly. He took a deep breath and waited for the judge to give the signal. 
</P>
<P>
The collegians debated on the topic chosen nationally for all contests during 
the 1989-90 school year: "It is resolved that the federal government should 
adopt an energy policy which substantially reduces non-military consumption of 
fossil fuels in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper had nine minutes to present an affirmative argument, which meant 
defining terms and explaining his team's position on the use of alternative 
fuel sources. 
</P>
<P>
Standing with a stoic face, Cooper hit his stopwatch and rattled off his 
arguments. He stopped only to take quick deep breaths and continued to fire off 
the key points. 
</P>
<P>
Becky Bjork, a forensics coach from the University of Utah and a judge in the 
competition, told a visitor: "If this is the first time you hear debaters, 
you'll be amazed at how fast they talk. But the more you hear it, the easier it 
is to pick out the key points." 
</P>
<P>
From La Verne, Tony Lacsamana, 26, a senior majoring in political science, had 
the task of refuting the Harvard team's proposals. He questioned Cooper and 
demanded to see references. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper's teammate, Matt Schnall, 21, crawled beneath the desk to search the 
files for more evidence supporting his team's arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Bjork sat there jotting down as fast as she could on a yellow legal pad the key 
elements of Cooper's arguments. She used a black pen to indicate Harvard's side 
and when the La Verne team began to cross-examine, she used a red pen. Her 
writing was in a small, fine print. 
</P>
<P>
Bjork said she would choose the winner of the debate by putting down the 
affirmative side's arguments and proposals and seeing if the negative team 
disputes them. 
</P>
<P>
"After listening to debaters on the topic for months, I have no problem picking 
out their arguments no matter how fast they talk," Bjork said. 
</P>
<P>
She announced at the end of the round that Harvard had won. 
</P>
<P>
La Verne debater Lacsamana said afterward: "We're generally the underdog. This 
was a real slow round for us. Harvard has an excellent program and a good 
library with a lot more resources." 
</P>
<P>
Schnall, a philosophy and math major at Harvard, said: "We began researching in 
the summer. It's a pretty significant burden but nothing unmanageable. It 
definitely takes away time from the social scene at college." 
</P>
<P>
The final round of the competition was held late Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert H. Gass, director of the forensics program at Cal State Fullerton, 
said the Fullerton tournament is just one of several in which the debate teams 
participate before the invitational National Debate Tournament in the last week 
of March. NDT debates are on public policy issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cal State Fullerton tournament, there were eight rounds. All teams with 
a 5-3 record or better advanced to the elimination rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gass stressed the amount of time that debate students spend each week 
researching and practicing their skills. "The best teams in the country spend 
at least 20 to 40 hours a week in the library," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Evelyn Becker, 21, a four-year debate student from USC, said: "Debate has 
improved my school grades and work. It helped me learn research skills, time 
efficiency and motivated me in intellectual pursuits." 
</P>
<P>
Becker said she did not mind leaving college friends to travel across the 
country debating. "Debaters become your friends. You coordinate events around 
debate activities. Sometimes there's a little tension at the tournaments, but I 
think that comes from nervousness more than hostility toward another team." 
</P>
<P>
However, her teammate, Rob McDade, 21, said: "I'd like to beat Harvard this 
year. They have beat us a few years in a row."

MANISCALCO WITNESS TELLS OF FEAR; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A FORMER MOTORCYCLE GANG MEMBER DESCRIBED EVENTS ON THE NIGHT OF THE 
KILLINGS. HE SAID HE THEN HID FOR A YEAR TO AVOID BEING THE NEXT TO DIE.

<P>
A 36-year-old former member of a motorcycle gang testified Wednesday that he 
was so frightened after watching Thomas F. Maniscalco and a small band of 
killers leave three people dead in a Westminster home in 1980 that he hid for a 
year for fear he would be next. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Robbins, a bearded former member of The Family motorcycle gang in 
Michigan, was the leadoff witness at Maniscalco's murder trial in the Memorial 
Day triple slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-examination is to begin today and could keep Robbins on the witness stand 
at least two more days. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins -- who has changed his name and relocated with government help -- told 
jurors that another motorcyclist named "Little Phil" Warren was the actual 
killer of two young men and a young woman. But it was Maniscalco, a founder of 
the Hessian motorcycle gang and a defense lawyer, who was in charge, Robbins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Since his arrest nearly six years ago, Maniscalco, 44, has gained notoriety as 
a lawyer for other inmates and a leading protester of conditions in Orange 
County Jail. He contends that he has been a target of prosecutors for years 
because of his defense work for other Hessian bikers in their court cases. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard M. King contends that Maniscalco spent more time 
dealing in drugs and counterfeit money out of his Westminster home than he did 
practicing law. 
</P>
<P>
King told jurors that Maniscalco masterminded the murders because of a dispute 
with one of the victims. But also, King says, Maniscalco hatched a plan to have 
Robbins, one of several bikers living with him, killed and then blamed for the 
Westminster murders. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins testified that Maniscalco ordered him to take the motorcycle of one of 
the victims with him when Robbins and Warren left for Michigan the day after 
the killing. The motorcycle was later found in Michigan, registered to Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors theorize that if Maniscalco's plan had worked, Robbins would have 
been dead by the time the police discovered he had "stolen" the victim's 
motorcycle and was probably the killer. 
</P>
<P>
King asked Robbins why he didn't run when the killings began. It was the only 
time the subdued witness showed any emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was standing there in a dead man's house with his motorcycle in my name. 
Where was I supposed to go?" Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were Richard (Rabbit) Rizzone, 36, and his girlfriend, Rena Miley, 
19, who were living in the house where the killings occurred, and Thomas 
Monahan, 28, a occasional bodyguard for Rizzone. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say Maniscalco wanted Rizzone, his former best friend, killed 
because Rizzone had "ripped him off" in both drugs and counterfeit money. 
</P>
<P>
Also charged with murder is Daniel Duffy, 45, another former Hessian. Warren, 
the purported triggerman, was killed in a shoot-out with police in Moore, 
Okla., six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins calmly led jurors through events on the night of the killings. He went 
to the Rizzone house with Maniscalco on the lawyer's orders, Robbins said. 
Duffy and Warren were already inside and Rizzone was already dead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he passed Monahan coming up the driveway when he went outside to 
move one of the cars. When he got back inside, Monahan had been shot and was 
dying. Robbins said the leaders sent him to the garage to check the gas tanks 
of Rizzone's vehicles. When he came back, Monahan was finally dead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miley was still alive, Robbins said, when he was told to drive back to 
Maniscalco's house on Rizzone's motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
When the three bodies were discovered more than a week later, Miley was found 
nude in one of the bedrooms. She had been raped. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the back of the courtroom taking careful notes on Robbins' testimony 
was Charles Margines, one of Duffy's attorneys. Duffy's trial is scheduled to 
follow Maniscalco's. 
</P>
<P>
"We think he is lying," Margines said of the witness. Margines speculated that 
much of Robbins' version would cave in under cross-examination today by 
Maniscalco's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Questions on Band-Aid 
</P>
<P>
One fact not lost on any of the lawyers involved is that Robbins claims that he 
was always out of the house when any the shootings took place. 
</P>
<P>
Also, a Band-Aid wrapper found near Miley's body is expected to play a part in 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he had been ordered to put Band-Aids on all his fingers, 
presumably to keep from leaving prints in the house. The others wore gloves, 
Robbins said, except for Maniscalco, who searched the house with his hand 
wrapped in a rag. 
</P>
<P>
"He claims he didn't go into the bedroom where the girl was raped, yet there's 
the wrapper and he is the only one wearing Band-Aids," Maniscalco attorney 
Joanne Harrold had said earlier during one of the pretrial hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins told jurors that after he and Warren drove back to Lansing, Mich., 
where they lived, Warren told him that Maniscalco had ordered him killed. 
Robbins said he lived in the woods for a year out of fear. King asked him why 
he finally came out. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured I either had to face up to what I was involved in or spend the rest 
of my life running," Robbins said.

<P>
An Anaheim man was wounded by gunfire outside El Tropico Bar at 900 S. Anaheim 
Blvd. around 6 p.m. Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Efrain Tejada-Barron was in the intensive care unit at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana on Wednesday, listed in stable condition, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police were called to an apartment complex at 944 S. Anaheim Blvd. at 
6:05 Tuesday, where they found Tejada-Barron. A bullet had entered his hip and 
exited through his abdomen, Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said. 
</P>
<P>
Hedgpeth said Tejada-Barron had reportedly argued with a young man at El 
Tropico. The two men stepped outside to fight and the young man pulled a weapon 
and shot Tejada-Barron. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman fled and could not be found, and Tejada-Barron "fled or stumbled" to 
the front of the apartment complex where he was found, Hedgpeth said. 
Tejada-Barron refused to give his address to police and didn't identify a 
possible suspect, he said. JAMES ROBBINS

Until Wednesday, all that remained of Christmas for a mother and her two sons 
were the melted toys destroyed along with almost everything they owned in a 
Christmas tree fire on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange County firefighters on Wednesday arrived with two bicycles and 
armloads of gifts. 
</P>
<P>
For Beverly Pearson, who was given a one-day notice of the delivery, it helped 
ease the stress of having to start all over again only two months after she 
moved her two sons to South Orange County from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I really appreciate this," said Pearson, a full-time registered nurse who also 
works part time in home health care. "I lost my letterhead, a typewriter, a 
copier and office supplies. I didn't know what I was going to do about the 
toys." 
</P>
<P>
The gifts were supplied through the Orange County Fire Department's "Operation 
Santa Claus" program, which collects new toys for needy children. The toys 
distributed Wednesday were among some that were not delivered for the holidays, 
said Capt. David Buck of Laguna Niguel Station No. 5, which handled the fire 
call at Pearson's home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming back this time to spread Christmas cheer," Buck said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze began when a dried Christmas tree ignited as Pearson dragged it past 
a fire she had just started in the fireplace. Although the family escaped 
unharmed, the fire caused an estimated $120,000 of damage in a matter of 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Pearson's sons, Shane, 12, and Tyler, 8, wasted no time in deciding that 
Wednesday's presents were at least as good as their first. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh mom, look, a basketball!" Shane said, pulling a box out of three large 
plastic bags carted by the firefighters into the crowding living room of the 
new family apartment. "This is just like the one that got wasted. No way, I 
can't believe it! This is too good." 
</P>
<P>
"Excellent!" squealed Tyler beaming at a new motocross-style bicycle wheeled 
into the dining area. "This is a better Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are very lucky," Pearson said, noting that neighbors donated sofas, 
lamps and a refrigerator to furnish her new apartment in the same Laguna Niguel 
complex. The Red Cross also provided assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"And we will have an artificial tree next year," she added. "We've already 
bought it on a half-price sale." WENDY PAULSON

2 ARMORIES GIVE SHELTER FROM COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLISON SAMUELS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After 25 years of marriage and 14 years of custodial work at a Los Angeles 
elementary school, William J. Brown Jr. lost his home, his family and his job 
because he couldn't give up cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, that's all I cared about," Brown said. "What happened tomorrow 
didn't matter. Now it does." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 47, was one of more than 30 men who found shelter from the season's low 
temperatures Wednesday at the National Guard Armory in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Armories in Santa Ana and Fullerton were opened to the homeless both Tuesday 
and Wednesday nights in response to continued chilly weather, Orange County 
social services officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually like it better on the street," said Brown, who said he has quit 
cocaine but now spends most of his nights on local park benches. "A lot of 
times you don't have freedom in places like this. But here, I can come and go 
as I please." 
</P>
<P>
The county's Social Services Agency said a total of 60 people were given 
shelter Tuesday night and that about 90 people were expected Wednesday. The 
doors open at 5:45 p.m. at the armories at 400 S. Brookhurst Road, Fullerton, 
and 612 E. Warner Ave., Santa Ana. Guests must leave by 7 the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of homeless taking advantage of the offer of a warm place to 
spend the night was far below the capacity of 125 at each armory, the numbers 
typically increase as word of the opening spreads, said Margaret Beck, manager 
of adult services and the homeless shelter program for the Social Services 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
But for 26-year-old Kevin Hunter, also a recovering cocaine addict who said he 
had just been released from Orange County Jail for traffic offenses, it was 
hunger and not the cold that brought him to the armory. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't like these type of places because they're only temporary," 
Hunter said as he ate spaghetti and meatballs. "I was hungry; that's why I am 
here. But if it isn't cold and the temperature doesn't drop like it did tonight 
or last night, nobody cares about where you're sleeping. It's messed up being 
homeless, whatever the temperature." 
</P>
<P>
Under rules laid out by Gov. George Deukmejian, the armories open to the 
homeless when temperatures are expected to fall below 40 degrees or below 50 
degrees with a 50% chance of rain. It was the former category, the cold, that 
resulted in Wednesday's opening, Beck said. 
</P>
<P>
By this time last year, armories in Orange County had opened 15 times during 
that colder winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I am thankful for this bad weather," said 23-year-old Kurt Gaoldo, who 
lost his job a few weeks ago and couldn't pay rent on his apartment. 
"Otherwise, who knows where I'd be?" ALLISON SAMUELS

2 FIRMS MOVE TO BID ON HIGH-SPEED TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY PERLMAN WITH WIRE REPORTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two companies expressed formal interest Wednesday in building a 
high-speed-train link between Orange County and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
A German company and a French company each put up an initial $5,000 deposit and 
announced its intention to bid on the train, which backers hope will link Las 
Vegas to a station near Anaheim Stadium with trains running at 300 m.p.h. by 
1997. Round-trip fares would be $75 to $100, according to recent estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a monumental occasion," said Arnie Adamsen, a Las Vegas city 
councilman and chairman of the bi-state California-Nevada Superspeed Train 
Commission. "Everything up to this point has been speculation and theory. Now 
we have actual dollars involved from the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
The two companies, Transrapid International, a German company bidding in 
conjunction with the Bechtel Corp., and TGV, a subsidiary of the French 
national railroad, must submit their proposals along with another $495,000 to 
the commission by July 15. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana Wednesday, Commission Vice Chairman Don R. Roth, an Orange County 
supervisor, mailed out requests for proposals to dozens of other firms as well. 
</P>
<P>
Roth previously acknowledged, however, that Transrapid starts out as the 
front-runner because it has expressed the most interest and has already 
committed millions of dollars to preliminary project documentation. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the bidding procedure, the proposed trains must run at least 180 
m.p.h. and firms must show they have the estimated $4 billion in private 
financing that is needed to build and run the system. 
</P>
<P>
The request for bids followed the earlier selection of the Anaheim area as the 
Southern California terminus of the proposed train system, which was originally 
proposed by Las Vegas gambling interests. A spur that would take trains to 
Palmdale is also tentatively planned. 
</P>
<P>
Adamsen said the Transrapid-Bechtel combine is strengthened in its position as 
front-runner because, unlike TGV, it plans a magnetically levitated system in 
which the trains run on a cushion of air above the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel officials said in December that the company had already spent $3 
million studying the feasibility of the line and was prepared to spend another 
$12 million to prepare the studies necessary to secure financing for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
TGV, however, is the manufacturer of Europe's only operational super-speed 
train, which travels on traditional rails at speeds approaching 200 m.p.h. Last 
month the train set a world record for the highest speed on rails, rocketing a 
train along a section of track in France at a speed of 299.7 m.p.h. JEFFREY

MIKE PENNER: TARK TURNS BIG WEST INTO FEEDING FRENZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just another night in the Shark Tank, the wackiest, tackiest place in 
the Big West, and how will this date be remembered in Runnin' Rebel history? 
</P>
<P>
Well, they draped an Olympic medal around the neck of Nevada Las Vegas forward 
Stacey Augmon, a replica of the bronze original he won in 1988 and then lost in 
the aftermath of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
There was that -- and then there was a game against some team wearing blue 
shirts. The final score was 94-66. The Rebels had 69 rebounds and nine 
three-point field goals. The other guys shot 31% and had 16 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
It was as routine as the pregame fireworks they light inside the Thomas and 
Mack Center during player introductions -- safe and sane, of course. It was as 
predictable as Tark's towel, as embarrassing as what passes for fashion in the 
stands, a rout by rote. 
</P>
<P>
It also came against the team many had considered the best of the Big Rest, Cal 
State Fullerton, which had dumped Las Vegas in overtime last season and still 
had Cedric Ceballos, who has been dogging Augmon longer than the lost medal. 
</P>
<P>
The Big West race was nice while it lasted. 
</P>
<P>
Only 62 more shopping days until the conference tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's the team that's going to win the national championship," said a 
flabbergasted John Sneed, Fullerton's head coach. "They're playing as well as 
any team in America right now. 
</P>
<P>
"Supposedly, Santa Barbara, Long Beach and ourselves are among the better teams 
in the league -- and look at what what they did to us here. It gives you a feel 
for just how good a team they have." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach lost at Las Vegas by 20 points last week, a final score 
that had caused some jaws to slack. Santa Barbara still awaits on the schedule. 
But the Titans, 6-3 at game time, have come and gone, leaving nothing behind 
except maybe a few chalk outlines on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was supposed to have a slim chance Wednesday night because of 
Ceballos, the senior forward who tends to drive Augmon nuts and Coach Jerry 
Tarkanian to hyperbole. Augmon, a defensive demon hailed by one preseason 
publication as the best in the country, looked awfully vulnerable and awfully 
sedentary during his first three encounters with Ceballos last season. Ceballos 
averaged 29.3 points in those games, prompting Tark to remark that his Rebels 
would've won the 1989 NCAA title if Ceballos wore UNLV silver and red. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Ceballos had 16 points in the first half -- and the Titans 
still trailed, 47-30. In the second half, he managed just three points. Hence, 
the runaway. 
</P>
<P>
But Augmon couldn't be declared the clear-cut winner in Round IV. He didn't 
stick around long enough. With Tarkanian clearing his bench shortly after the 
second-half tipoff, Augmon logged just 23 minutes of court time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice when you get to play everybody," Tark said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
Ceballos had to admit: These Rebels are even better than the ones that reached 
last spring's final eight. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he said, "they've added to it. They've got (Larry) Johnson to help them 
inside and (Travis) Bice outside. I think they're capable of winning the 
national championship." 
</P>
<P>
Said Sneed: "I don't see anyone in the conference beating UNLV in Las Vegas 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
What about outside of Las Vegas. The schedule commits Fullerton to one more 
encounter with the Rebels, next time at Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
"They're pretty good but beatable," Ceballos maintained. "We've just got to do 
the correct things. We have enough talent. Tonight, we just didn't do things 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"We just have to execute. In our gym, we'll be more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
Wishful thinking? Most likely. But the Shark Tank can be intimidating, with or 
without the cornball shark silhouettes flashed amid the rafters of Thomas and 
Mack before each game. During halftime, a gang of Rebel rowdies under one 
basket grabbed Tuffy Titan, Fullerton's motley elephant-in-drag mascot, and 
began passing him, overhead, up into the stands. 
</P>
<P>
Is nothing sacred? 
</P>
<P>
Tarkanian, of course, spots a potential weakness in the road ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We're on the road for our next four games," he points out. "And, from here on 
out, we're playing every third day. We've got a heavy schedule the rest of the 
season. I can't tell you how difficult it is to play four games in eight days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough emotionally and mentally on you. And if we're not emotionally and 
mentally ready, we can be flat, which is dangerous, because every team is sky 
high for us." 
</P>
<P>
That we'll believe when we see it. 
</P>
<P>
It's only January, four days into the new year, but with Las Vegas and the Big 
West, it's looking again like the same old story.

WALK-ON FRESHMAN GUARD MAKING A POINT OF DELIGHTING MULLIGAN, FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The strange-but-true saga of Ben Rishwain, walk-on guard and cult hero to the 
Bren Center fans, began a year ago in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine wanted Rishwain badly last season. And the feeling was mutual. 
</P>
<P>
Rishwain, then a scrappy point guard at St. Mary's High School in Stockton, had 
heard the recruiting spiel from nearby University of the Pacific and wasn't all 
that impressed. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine came calling and piqued Rishwain's interest. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble was, Irvine had just used its last available scholarship on Craig 
Marshall, a defensive whiz from Saddleback High. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Mulligan called Rishwain to break the bad news one day and got an 
interesting response. Rishwain was still interested. He actually wanted to walk 
on. In fact, he turned down a scholarship from the University of New Mexico to 
come to Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Why would an otherwise bright, 16-points-a-game scorer from a high school team 
that finished 33-1 want to give up an all-expenses-paid college education? 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I'd have a good chance to play here," Rishwain said. "I didn't want 
to stay home. You want to get away when you go to college." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Mulligan said he will give Rishwain a scholarship as soon as one 
becomes available next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the kid," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
That, in itself, is something unusual. In his 10 seasons at Irvine, Mulligan 
has blasted, bullied and benched his point guards more than once. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan saying something nice about a point guard? 
</P>
<P>
It probably has something to do with Rishwain's play. The moment he enters the 
game to spell starter Rod Palmer, Rishwain is a blur. 
</P>
<P>
He hounds the opposing point guard, waving his hands wildly. It was his 
aggressive defensive play that resulted in a broken index finger on his left 
hand -- his shooting hand -- against Tennessee Chattanooga Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was reaching back and hit someone or something," Rishwain said. "I 
didn't know it was broken, but suddenly I was dribbling the ball and my finger 
felt like it was inside the ball. It felt weird. I knew something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
He had surgery on his finger and missed five games, but returned Tuesday to 
score five points, make four steals and give the Anteaters a big boost in 17 
minutes of play against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,686 fans, particularly those in the student section Tuesday, cheered his 
every move. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they like the way I play," Rishwain said with a shrug and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
The Anteaters (2-8 overall, 0-1 in Big West play) and their fans sorely missed 
his play the five games -- four of them losses -- he missed. 
</P>
<P>
"He really started to come around when he got hurt," Mulligan said. "He's still 
a freshman. He still makes mistakes, but some of the older guys are making 
mistakes, too. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a winner. He's a mature kid, an unbelievably mature kid." 
</P>
<P>
In four games, Rishwain has been rock-solid. He has made five of seven shots 
from the field and averaged three points a game in spot duty. 
</P>
<P>
"I expected a big transition (to the college game)," said Rishwain, who is 
5-feet-10. "I expected it to be different. But you realize what the differences 
are and you adjust. I just play like I always have." 
</P>
<P>
Which is to say Rishwain has played well. 
</P>
<P>
The only time his inexperience showed was when a former UCI point guard dropped 
by the Bren Center during the Christmas break. 
</P>
<P>
It seems Scott Brooks, now with the Philadelphia 76ers, stopped in to see 
Mulligan and work out. He wound up working over Rishwain in a scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought his confidence was shattered," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
Rishwain just laughed and said, "I said to Mulligan, 'He's a pro and I'm a 
walk-on.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rishwain is expecting a big homecoming when the Anteaters play Pacific Tuesday 
night at Stockton. How big, he's not saying. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," he said. "I told them all to buy tickets, though. I can't get 
enough passes." 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan continues to be impressed by his freshmen -- Rishwain, Marshall, Dylan 
Rigdon and Jeff Von Lutzow. 
</P>
<P>
At one point Tuesday against Utah State, Mulligan had Rishwain, Marshall and 
Von Lutzow in the game at once. 
</P>
<P>
"The four freshmen are playing pretty well right now," Mulligan said. "You're 
going to see a lot more of them." 
</P>
<P>
Von Lutzow, a 6-9 forward from Charter Oak High School in Covina, led the 
freshmen with eight points against Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
In eight games, he's averaging 7.5 points and shooting 54.5% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"Von Lutzow's going to be a great player," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
There's no secret why Irvine is 2-8 this season. Poor shooting has been the 
Anteaters' biggest problem. Going into tonight's game against San Jose State 
(7:30 in the Bren Center), the Anteaters are shooting 43.7% from the field and 
66.1% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think our defense is getting us beat," Mulligan said after Irvine shot 
less than 40% from the field for the second consecutive game. "It's our 
offense. We can't put the ball in the hole. We gotta make those free throws. 
It's just . . . the ball's gotta go in." 
</P>
<P>
Of the Anteaters' missed free throws against Utah State, center Ricky Butler 
said, "There's no excuse for missing free throws." 
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's swimming teams play host to the PICK Systems Invitational 
at 9 a.m. Saturday and Sunday at Heritage Park in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
USC, the second-ranked men's team in the nation, Cal State Long Beach, UC 
Riverside and Cal State Northridge are among those expected to compete.

Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dean Andrea, the women's basketball coach, was so upset with his team's play in 
an 89-45 loss to the University of the Pacific Tuesday, he held an hourlong 
postgame practice in Crawford Hall. Irvine is 1-9, which ties the Anteaters' 
worst start in history. The Anteaters also were 1-9 in the 1978-79 season. 
Irvine plays at UC Santa Barbara at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The UCI Athletic Foundation will hold a tip-off celebration at 6 p.m. Jan. 11 
in the Koll Room in the Bren Center to open its fund drive. The Anteaters' NCAA 
champion water polo team will be honored. For reservations and tickets to that 
night's game against Cal State Long Beach, call 856-5550. . . . Irvine will 
play host to a distance runners coaching clinic Jan. 13. The clinic is 
sponsored by The Athletics Congress. Registration is at 8:30 a.m. and costs $5. 
For more information, call (805) 756-1130.

It seemed that every time Orange Lutheran High School needed a big play 
Wednesday night in its Olympic League opener against Santa Margarita, senior 
forward Daryl Cole made a steal, scored a basket or made a nice pass to set up 
a teammate. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, a three-year starter, was the difference in Orange Lutheran's 75-69 
victory against a young Santa Margarita team that is playing only its second 
season of varsity basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The game matched defending champion Orange Lutheran, which was undefeated in 
league play last year, against Santa Margarita, which doesn't have a senior on 
its roster but is bidding for its first postseason berth in the Southern 
Section's 2-A division. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Margarita (3-7) fell behind, 12-2, but managed to stay close to Orange 
Lutheran because of center Jeff Layne and forward Bill Bathey. Layne scored 11 
of his 15 points in the first quarter, and Bathey had nine of his 16 points in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
But Orange Lutheran (7-5) clinched the victory near the end of the third 
quarter, when Cole made two consecutive jump shots and then stole a pass and 
fed teammate Luke Aucoin for an easy layup to give the Lancers a 58-45 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"That type of senior leadership is just what we need the most," said Rich 
Schaff, Santa Margarita's coach. "I think we have a good team, but whenever the 
game is close, we don't have anyone who takes control like Cole did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was significant for Orange Lutheran after the league's other two 
favorites, Whittier Christian and Valley Christian, lost their league openers 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's five teams who could win the league, and Santa Margarita is 
one of them," said Jerry Simmons, Orange Lutheran's coach. "I wasn't sure how 
we would play after playing all those large schools in the holiday tournaments. 
I thought we rekindled some of the fire from last year tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Cole and Kent Dowding each had 22 points for Orange Lutheran, and sophomore 
point guard Luke Aucoin added 13 points and six assists.

Alpha Microsystems: The Santa Ana-based computer company said the continuing 
slump in the domestic computer industry contributed to a 93% decline in profit 
for the third fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Net income for the quarter ended Nov. 26 dropped to $60,000 from $814,000 for 
the comparable period a year ago. Sales rose 4%, to $13.6 million from $13.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine-month period, net income declined 64%, to $752,000, from $2.1 
million for the first three quarters last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sales increased 7%, to $40.8 million from $38 million. 
</P>
<P>
Robert B. Hitchcock, chairman and chief executive, said that although 
third-quarter sales increased from the second quarter of the fiscal year, 
"Alpha Microsystems' third-quarter sales and earnings were not up to 
expectations."

LOAN CRITIQUES MISUNDERSTOOD, THRIFT LAWYER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
COURT HEARING: AN ATTORNEY FOR IRVINE-BASED LINCOLN SAVINGS &amp; LOAN SAYS HER 
LETTERS DESCRIBING SOME LOAN DOCUMENTS AS 'UNSAFE AND UNSOUND' WERE NOT 
INTENDED TO SUGGEST THE LOANS WERE IMPROPER. 
</P>

<P>
A lawyer hired by Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan to review about 90 major loans 
testified Wednesday that her caustic remarks about the Irvine thrift's 
underwriting practices were not meant to indicate that there was anything 
improper about the loans. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Gordon said she was "trying to act" like a thrift regulator when she told 
Lincoln executives in four 1988 letters that some loan documents were 
"ridiculous," lacked needed information and could be viewed as "unsafe and 
unsound." 
</P>
<P>
Her testimony came on the fourth day of a U.S. District Court hearing before 
Judge Stanley Sporkin, who scheduled the sessions to test the evidence used by 
federal regulators to justify their April 14 takeover of Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Orange County thrift could become the nation's biggest 
S&amp;L disaster, with a potential cost to taxpayers of more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The court hearing focuses on four transactions that regulators claim typify the 
failure of Lincoln's former parent firm, American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, 
to operate the S&amp;L safely and soundly and conserve assets. 
</P>
<P>
American Continental filed for bankruptcy protection on April 13, the day 
before the federal seizure. It sued regulators a week later, claiming that they 
lacked sufficient evidence to show that Lincoln was being operated unsafely and 
unsoundly and was dissipating assets. 
</P>
<P>
Sporkin is the first judge to review the merits of the longstanding differences 
between regulators and former Lincoln operators. Some American Continental 
executives, including Chairman Charles H. Keating Jr., are expected to take the 
stand, beginning today. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon, an attorney at a major New York law firm, said comments that she made 
in the letters to Lincoln officials often involved information that she, not 
regulators, wanted to see in the loan files. 
</P>
<P>
She disputed a claim by James P. Murphy, a lawyer for the Office of Thrift 
Supervision, that appraisals, missing in some cases from Lincoln's loan files, 
were required for every loan or extension of credit. But she said she liked to 
see appraisals in the files anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"In many cases, the documents existed. They were just not in the files," Gordon 
said. She wanted the documents in the files, she said, because the "files 
should fully describe the transactions." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for American Continental spent most of Wednesday's hearing 
cross-examining Kevin T. O'Connell, an OTS executive. They called attention to 
a series of documents considered favorable to Lincoln that O'Connell had left 
out of the administrative file he compiled for the Federal Home Loan Bank 
Board, the predecessor agency to OTS. 
</P>
<P>
The administrative file contained the basic information that the board used to 
decide that Lincoln should be seized. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell testified that he left out the information mainly because he and his 
staff believed that it did not fit with the conclusions they had reached 
already. Omitted, for instance, were documents showing that a loan to developer 
Ernest C. Garcia was used for its intended purpose -- to buy his company back. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators maintain that the loan provided Garcia with enough money to allow 
him to lend part of it to an investment firm that in turn bought Lincoln-owned 
land. Regulators said the transaction was a sham and contend that Garcia was 
the real owner. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell also acknowledged that Lincoln's huge losses -- more than $800 
million through the first nine months of 1989 -- came mainly from writedowns of 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
But the lower values assigned to the land came from a change in accounting 
classifications, he said, not from the depressed real estate market in Arizona, 
where Lincoln had extensive holdings. He said regulators decided to reclassify 
the land based on market value because they decided to liquidate the property, 
requiring a $600-million writedown.

fast-food eateries and Chick's Sporting Goods. 
</P>
<P>
In-N-Out Burger and El Pollo Loco are coming to the community shopping center 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
They are the first of four fast-food tenants planned for Tustin Market Place, 
the 750,000-square-foot, open center at Jamboree Road and the Santa Ana 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
El Pollo Loco signed a 20-year lease and broke ground in December on a 
2,700-square-foot building. The restaurant is scheduled for completion by July. 
</P>
<P>
In-N-Out Burger, scheduled to open in the spring, has a 20-year lease for 3,500 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the fast-food chains was made by Donahue Schriber of Newport 
Beach, which is developing and managing the center. 
</P>
<P>
Chick's Sporting Goods has signed a lease for 50,000 square feet at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Chick's construction should begin in November, with completion scheduled for 
early summer, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
And construction was recently completed by two larger retailers -- T.J. Maxx 
and Ross Dress for Less. Both merchants are leasing 23,000-square-foot spaces 
at the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin Market Place first caught attention -- and a lot of criticism -- in late 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
That was after the Irvine Co., which owns Tustin Market Place, had painted the 
center in a bold color scheme of purple and brownish-red. But when many 
complained about the colors, the entire center was repainted in a brownish-red 
tone. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the center has grown to include three home-improvement retailers as 
anchor tenants -- STOR, Home Express and Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
A six-screen Edwards Cinema is also due to join the Tustin center eventually.

WELLS FARGO FILES SUIT OVER PROPERTY LIEN 
</P>

Wells Fargo Bank filed suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court here to lift a 
week-old lien on its California real estate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The lien prevents Wells Fargo from selling any of its California real estate 
holdings with a clear title. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing on the appeal is scheduled for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The disputed lien was obtained Dec. 27 by Ted Hays, a 78-year-old former 
developer who won a $700,000 Superior Court judgment against the bank on Sept. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found that Wells Fargo in 1984 had mistakenly issued checks for the 
refinancing of Hays' Orange County residential development to the wrong person 
while Hays was in the hospital undergoing treatment for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
When Hays left the hospital, his property was being foreclosed and his real 
estate business was in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo is appealing that judgment but has refused to post the normally 
required bond on the ground that its federal charter exempted it from that 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
That spurred Hays' attorney to return to court last week, where he persuaded 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien to order a lien on the bank's 
California real estate to protect Hays' interests. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien initially approved the lien early in December but held off issuing it 
while he considered and then rejected motions by Wells Fargo for a stay and a 
new trial.

DEPOSIT DRAIN SLOWS DURING OCTOBER AT NATION'S THRIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's savings and loans lost $5.6 billion in deposits in October, lower 
than the $8.7 billion outflow in September, the government said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Office of Thrift Supervision said that brings the total outflow for 
1989 through October to $59.2 billion, leaving the industry with $949.3 billion 
in total deposits. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also said the October numbers show that the industry continued to 
shrink in size to meet new, tougher federal capital standards that took effect 
Dec. 7, albeit at a slower pace than before. By shrinking, institutions raise 
the percentage that their capital -- their cushion against financial losses -- 
makes up of their overall assets. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, thrifts had about $1.3 trillion in assets in October. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators also said the total assets of the savings and loan industry were 
virtually unchanged in October, compared to a $15.2-billion decline in 
September. The amount in thrifts not in conservatorship -- being run under 
supervision of regulators -- rose by $800 million, but the OTS noted that the 
reason was mostly because of "the activity of one large West Coast 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
Regulators refused to identify the West Coast thrift, and industry sources said 
they were baffled as well. 
</P>
<P>
Major California thrifts said it does not refer to them. One speculation was 
that the asset numbers may have been influenced by the Oct. 13 acquisition by 
Toronto-based Royal Trustco Ltd. of Pacific Savings Bank, a Coast Mesa thrift 
that was previously operated under the supervision of regulators. That thrift, 
now called Pacific First Bank, had about $1 billion in assets in October. 
</P>
<P>
Economists and analysts said that because the government continues to put sick 
thrifts into conservatorship and is selling off problems ones, it is difficult 
to draw conclusions using the agency's month-to-month figures. They added that 
figures for November and December are likely to show significant shrinkage of 
assets by the industry because thrifts made a number of moves just before the 
new capital requirements went into effect.

IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, CAMBODIAN WOMEN FIND SOLACE SHARING THEIR ANGUISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For thousands of Cambodian women in Southern California, the mourning brought 
on by years of strife in their homeland has never stopped. Memories of a lost 
child or the massacre of entire families continue to fuel their grief. 
</P>
<P>
Help is difficult to find. Southern California offers only a handful of 
counseling services for some 70,000 refugees. And, according to counselors, 
Cambodian women face another obstacle: traditionally, they hold back feelings 
and are reluctant to talk about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
But every Thursday in Santa Ana, a group of 10 Cambodian women try to cope with 
the harsh memories that will not fade. At the Neighborhood Service Center, they 
talk about their lives and the hardships they have faced in the past as well as 
the present. 
</P>
<P>
Rann Luk's 6-year-old son haunts her. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Luk saw Thoeung was more than a decade ago in Cambodia. The boy 
had gone to get the family's daily portion of rice at a nearby granary. When he 
did not return, Luk went looking for him and found him lying still on the 
granary's dirt floor. 
</P>
<P>
"My child . . . I saw my child. When I touched him, he wouldn't move. I saw the 
bruise on his face and on his stomach and then the blood. I screamed. I cried," 
Luk said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers who had beaten Thoeung ordered Luk to bury her son. She begged not to. 
Although Thoeung appeared lifeless, she could not be sure he was dead. Unmoved, 
the guards threatened to kill her if she refused. So she dug a hole, placed her 
son in the ground, and buried him. 
</P>
<P>
Luk's nightmare did not end with the death of her 6-year-old son. Three of her 
other 10 children died during the deadly reign of Pol Pot in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Rann Luk is now 53 and she attends the weekly meetings at the Neighborhood 
Service Center on Standard Avenue faithfully. "I don't know what happiness is 
any more," she said. "I still don't know whether I can ever be happy again. It 
is too hard to think of hope." 
</P>
<P>
These women could never forget, even if they wanted to, said Sunly Ping 
Winkles, a case worker from the International Rescue Committee Inc., a 
voluntary agency that helps refugees resettle in Orange County. Winkles 
mediates the sessions at the Neighborhood Service Center, which helps about 
3,500 Cambodians living in the east side of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Most refugee service centers can satisfy only material needs such as shelter, 
food, and helping refugees file for financial assistance, Winkles said. And, 
she added, even if psychological help is offered, Cambodian women frequently do 
not seek it because they are not used to talking about their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
The language barrier leaves many Cambodian women feeling isolated, said Chheng 
Leao Heat, the coordinator of health and English programs at Cambodian Family, 
a refugee center in Santa Ana. Indeed, most of the women at the center speak 
little or no English. And even though some of them are taking English classes, 
they feel most comfortable talking in their own language. 
</P>
<P>
There is no pressure to talk if the women do not want to, said Mary Ann 
Salamida, the director of the Neighborhood Service Center. During recent 
sessions, several of those in attendance said nothing, preferring to listen. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the group vary in age, from early 20s to early 60s. The younger 
women are more Americanized, wearing jewelry and painting their nails. The 
older women stick to simple smocks and cotton skirts or pants. But for all 
their differences, the women are bound by their past. 
</P>
<P>
Since the group started seven months ago, the women have changed, Salamida 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more willing to talk now. They don't look as depressed. They want to 
talk to each other," she added. 
</P>
<P>
All of the women have horror stories to share. 
</P>
<P>
Winkles, who arrived in the United States in 1981 after several years in Thai 
refugee camps, has her own. 
</P>
<P>
Her family had lived in Kandal, a province near Phnom Penh, the capital of 
Cambodia. Winkles was a school teacher, who with her tax inspector husband, had 
four children. After the Khmer Rouge moved in, her family was sent to work in 
rice fields. From 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. she tended the paddies and her husband made 
baskets. Winkles said she trusted no one outside her family in the commune 
where she lived. Anyone could be an angkar, a member of the communist forces 
charged with maintaining order in the communes. 
</P>
<P>
"You never know who they were. They would come into the homes, pick anybody to 
arrest and you would never hear from that person again. Every day was 
frightening because you did not know who would be next." 
</P>
<P>
She watched her once healthy husband die of starvation at the age of 44. She 
cradled her daughter while she was dying of pneumonia. And she lost track of 
her other children when her family was divided and sent to different villages. 
Despite years of sending letters to friends and posting signs in refugee camps, 
Winkles does not know whether her children are dead. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole time was so unreal, so painful. I hated the war. I really hated the 
war," she said. 
</P>
<P>
All the women in the group had to stay in refugee camps before receiving 
permission to immigrate to other countries. Yan On, 57, still wears the forest 
green jacket issued by a camp. She lost seven of her 13 children in her 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish someone could hear me scream and cry, 'Where are my children? Where are 
my children?' " Yan On said. 
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, On has to sit on the floor instead of a chair. Her legs 
and back are in constant pain from past beatings and hard labor on the rice 
paddies. She remembers being beaten by an angkar, who ordered her to hurry when 
she and others were carrying rice along a muddy road. When On did not walk fast 
enough, he kicked her in the back, and she fainted from the pain, she said. 
Believing she was dead, the angkar left her on the road, where On awoke hours 
later in the dark. There was no one around to help her to shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't stand. It hurt so bad. I finally crawled back to the village," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Salamida said many of the women who come to the center are afraid to venture 
outside their own community so the group members sometime go on field trips to 
familiarize themselves with American institutions and life styles. On one trip 
they went to South Coast Plaza, where they window-shopped. The women took their 
children to ride on the mall's carousel, saying they want them to grow up with 
good memories. 
</P>
<P>
Lek Orn, 28, says she does not have any warm memories of her youth. Cuddling 
her 3-year-old daughter, Sophia, she says she cannot remember childhood friends 
or playing games. She does remember, though, the day she huddled on a tree 
branch, trying to stay quiet so she would not be beaten -- or worse. 
</P>
<P>
It was the day before Vietnam invaded Cambodia. She had been marching with a 
youth group when a bomb exploded near her village. Terrified, she ran to see if 
her mother had been injured. 
</P>
<P>
"When I found her, I felt such relief. But then my mother told me to hide, the 
youth group leader was looking for me," Lek Orn said. 
</P>
<P>
She climbed up a tree next to her home. Moments later, she saw the group leader 
question her mother. He carried a rope and threatened to slaughter her family 
if she was found, Lek said. 
</P>
<P>
"I realized I did something wrong when I went to find my mother. I knew they 
would kill me," she continued. Though her legs were cramped and she was hungry, 
she said she stayed on the branches like a statue. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't move," Lek said, holding her child closer to her chest. "I didn't 
want to die. I didn't want my family to die." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Lek eventually found her way to a Thai refugee camp and then to 
San Francisco where she lived in a shelter run by a Buddhist temple. From 
there, she moved to Orange County. She does not know what the future holds for 
her. But like many of the women in the group, she believes her child is now her 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my child to be happy," Lek said. "That's all I want for now."

IN AN ASIAN REFUGEE CAMP, PILOT MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM SEEKS TO EASE THE DESPAIR

SITE 2, ON THE THAI-CAMBODIAN BORDER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a hot and steamy night last November, as the muffled booms of artillery 
shells echoed in the distance, the pressures of life in this refugee camp 
turned one man into a monster. 
</P>
<P>
Angered that his wife and 6-year-old daughter had gone for an evening walk 
against his wishes, Touch Chamleakana began drinking heavily. When they 
returned, he savagely attacked them with an ax. Both died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
"A devil came into my head, it was magic," said the brooding, 35-year-old 
Cambodian, as he sat manacled in a jail cell two days later. "I want my family 
back. But I do not want to live here anymore. This camp, it is not a normal 
place to live." 
</P>
<P>
Site 2, where Chamleakana and 145,000 other refugees live, is a bamboo slum 
ringed by barbed wire less than 2 miles from the front lines of a bloody civil 
war. It is a camp without hope, a place where even the strongest spirits can 
shatter. 
</P>
<P>
Covering less than 4 square miles, Site 2 is the world's largest Cambodian city 
outside of Phnom Penh. It has no electricity, fresh food or water supplies of 
its own. Police protection is minimal and there is no defense against the 
artillery shells launched by enemy troops. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the camp opened in 1985, large families have been crammed into rows 
of tiny huts that offer no privacy. Raw sewage runs in open ditches. Refugees, 
many of whom fled to the border expecting a better life, have little to do 
during the day and live on a diet of low-grade rice and canned fish supplied by 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
For the Khmer, as Cambodians are known, Site 2 has been a virtual prison. 
</P>
<P>
But now, it is about to become a testing ground for the first-ever mental 
health program launched by the United Nations in a refugee camp. If successful, 
the program could become a model for other Cambodian border camps in Thailand 
and for U.N. hot spots throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents say the program will help Site 2 refugees, many of whom lost 
children and other family members to the murderous Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot and his 
henchmen slaughtered more than 1 million Cambodians in the 1975-79 genocide, 
and advocates say it would be inhumane not to provide counseling and support 
for the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
But critics question whether any kind of mental health effort is possible in a 
filthy, overcrowded camp where residents fear for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"If you or I lived in Site 2, we would be crazy," says Father Pierre Ceyrac, a 
missionary who has worked with the border Khmer since 1982. "There is no future 
here and there are no human rights here. There is only despair." 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, camp residents like Chamleakana have begun cracking 
under the strain of long-term confinement. Murder, rape and assault are 
increasing, and the suicide rate has doubled, according to U.N. statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Bandits from nearby villages break into the camp at night, hurling hand 
grenades at those who protest. Brothels and gambling dens attract thousands of 
men who have deserted their families. Many have taken second and third wives. 
</P>
<P>
Camp officials are especially concerned about the children who have grown up in 
Site 2 and know little about their homeland. More than 53% of the population is 
under 14, and although many youngsters are enrolled in school, few can read or 
write. For those nearing adulthood, the future is bleak. 
</P>
<P>
"In my heart, I am sad about living here," says Kheama Oum, a 19-year-old girl 
who fled to the border with her parents in 1987. "I cannot get married, because 
this is a very bad place to raise children." 
</P>
<P>
Oum, whose two older sisters were murdered by the Khmer Rouge, journeyed 50 
days on a path strewn with land mines to reach Site 2 and saw scores of dead 
bodies along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have bad dreams," she says. "I cannot forget." 
</P>
<P>
In light of these problems, it is not surprising that thousands of camp 
residents are demoralized, and that many have developed profound emotional 
problems, says Andy Pendleton, senior camp officer for the United Nations 
Border Relief Organization (UNBRO), a branch of the United Nations that 
provides food and water to the residents of Site 2. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't escape the conclusion that a mental health crisis is at hand here, 
because people were not meant to live like this," he says. "It's time for the 
world to recognize that in this camp, mental health and human rights are as 
much of a problem as food, water and shelter." 
</P>
<P>
But change comes slowly to Site 2. Although it is controlled by the Thai 
government, the camp is administered internally by the Kampuchean People's 
National Liberation Front, a U.S.-backed resistance group that is one of three 
factions fighting the Vietnam-backed Cambodian government. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrilla leaders restrict refugees from leaving the site and have opposed 
efforts to move the camp farther away from the front lines. UNBRO officials 
privately estimate that no more than 20% of the residents support the 
resistance and that most would leave the camp if they could. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that is an impossibility, given the Thai government's refusal to classify 
the Khmer as refugees. Instead, they have been labeled "displaced persons," a 
status that entitles them to only minimal standards of care and all but rules 
out their emigration to a third country. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tensions continue to rise. During a recent week at Site 2, a 
3-year-old girl was raped by a teen-age boy, according to UNBRO statistics. An 
18-year-old girl hanged herself, after an argument with her mother. Bandits 
broke through the fence, plundered the homes of several residents and injured 
19 innocent bystanders with hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
"The top priority at Site 2 should be making life safer for these people and 
enabling them to go home," says Pendleton. "But something also has to be done 
to help them cope with the pressures of living here." 
</P>
<P>
For years, relief workers at Site 2 have been lobbying U.N. officials to 
provide mental health services, as part of an overall campaign to guarantee 
human rights. Although the camp has three medical hospitals and a clinic to 
deal with "depression" among Khmer refugees, there are no programs dealing 
specifically with psychiatric problems. 
</P>
<P>
Thai and U.N. officials have delayed acting on such proposals, hoping that the 
Cambodian war would end and that the border camps could be closed. But action 
also has been delayed by the "uncomfortable link" between mental health and 
human rights issues, according to Roger Fordham, a Bangkok-based refugee 
specialist who coordinates relief groups working on the border. 
</P>
<P>
"This (mental health) is a touchy matter, because it leads you to tough 
political questions," he says. "Why isn't the camp moved to a safer place, away 
from shelling? Why isn't there a higher level of security?" 
</P>
<P>
There are no easy answers, given the politics of the Cambodian situation. 
Thailand, for example, does not want a massive influx of Khmer and insists that 
refugees stay where they are. Guerrilla leaders frown on Westerners entering 
the camp after dark, when most of the crime takes place. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and other Western nations have done little to challenge these 
policies, since they actively back the Cambodian resistance, a coalition that 
includes Site 2's rebel leaders, former Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Khmer 
Rouge. As a result, UNBRO officials say that their hands are tied and it would 
be difficult to move the refugees to another site. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, however, the political logjam eased somewhat. After Paris peace 
talks collapsed among the various Cambodian factions, U.N. officials gave the 
green light for an experimental mental health program at Site 2. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary plan would blend Western psychiatrists and specially trained 
Khmer practitioners and focus on severely disturbed residents. Counseling also 
would be offered to those burdened by traumatic Khmer Rouge memories. 
</P>
<P>
The impetus for the program came from several U.S. physicians, including 
Christopher Elias, a Seattle-based doctor who has spent many years working with 
the border Khmer, and Richard Mollica, a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist 
and Indochinese refugee expert. 
</P>
<P>
Mollica, who runs a psychiatric clinic for Southeast Asians at St. Elizabeth's 
Hospital in Boston, says the push for mental health services at Site 2 is a 
logical extension of the clinical work that he and other Cambodian specialists 
have been doing for years in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"In dealing with Khmer men and women, we see a population that has been exposed 
to extraordinary trauma, far more than the average person in our society," he 
says. "It seemed obvious that we would find even greater unhappiness in a camp 
where people live in daily fear for their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Mollica and a team of experts visited Site 2 in 1988 and again last year to lay 
the groundwork. Although they did not compile firsthand data, the group 
conducted numerous interviews with Khmer officials and estimated that symptoms 
of hopelessness and despair may affect up to 85% of the camp population, with 
hundreds needing immediate care.

<P>
Cambodian women in particular were found to have deep anxieties about their 
safety and the well-being of their children, according to reports issued by the 
group under the aegis of the World Federation for Mental Health, a nonprofit, 
non-governmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
A key recommendation was that camp officials improve security and move the 
refugees to a safer area. The study team plans another visit in April to gather 
data, and a final decision is expected this year by U.N. officials. 
</P>
<P>
Mollica's proposal has drawn a largely favorable response from Khmer medical 
officials at Site 2 and relief agencies. But others say the program may run 
into trouble because there is too great a gulf between Cambodian culture and 
Western psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how you can get people who have suffered from Pol Pot to simply 
open up," says Robert Brandts, a physician who has worked on the border since 
1980. "I worked with a tough Khmer woman for six years before I learned that 
five of her children had been killed by the Khmer Rouge." 
</P>
<P>
Others say the U.N. should focus more on human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's possible to provide effective mental health services 
in the middle of a war zone," says Mary Skully, a Connecticut-based psychiatric 
nurse who has worked with Cambodian refugees in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Even the army takes its own people off the front lines when it offers them 
counseling. Until we provide more security for these people, the idea of mental 
health is beside the point. It may even be a hoax." 
</P>
<P>
Mollica acknowledges the criticism, but says his program deserves a chance, 
even if larger political goals are not immediately met. 
</P>
<P>
"We may not be able to solve the human rights problem overnight, but that is no 
reason to let conditions at Site 2 fester," he says. "If you're bleeding badly, 
even a Band-Aid is better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
When Khmer Rouge leaders were driven from power by Vietnam's 1979 invasion of 
Cambodia, the world was stunned to learn of the genocide they had carried out. 
But their most lasting legacy may be the broken spirits of those Cambodians who 
somehow survived the killing fields. 
</P>
<P>
For these people, much like the victims of Auschwitz, the weight of traumatic 
memory can be a lifelong burden, according to James Lavelle, a Boston-based 
social worker who is a member of Mollica's team. 
</P>
<P>
"What the Khmer Rouge did was abhorrent, and we in the West probably can't 
imagine what it must be like to live through that kind of upheaval," he says. 
"If you talk to people at Site 2, each one of them can tell a story that is so 
horrible, you may not even believe it the first time you hear it." 
</P>
<P>
Hem Soeurn, a 49-year-old Site 2 resident, is a case in point. On the surface, 
he seems to be at ease in his new life as an assistant director of the Khmer 
People's Depression Relief Center. Sitting at a table in the quiet, bamboo 
building, he offers a visitor a cup of tea and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his wife, Phaly Nuon, Soeurn and other refugees are trying to ease 
the mental tensions that plague their countrymen. The center, which opened in 
1988, combines Western-style counseling with the traditional healing herbs that 
have been a part of Khmer culture for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about his background, Soeurn tells a harrowing story. When the Khmer 
Rouge came to power, he was stripped of his job as an accountant with the Shell 
Oil Co. in Phnom Penh and thrown into jail. His Khmer Rouge guards beat him 
savagely with metal bars, sometimes for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few weeks, Soeurn was told that his wife had been taken to a 
work camp, and he later learned two of his six children had been killed by the 
Khmer Rouge. From his prison cell, he saw scores of Cambodians slaughtered with 
axes and then dumped in mass graves. 
</P>
<P>
Soeurn survived only because he was able to fix rice-cleaning machines, and he 
spent weeks in captivity before being released to a work camp. After the 
Vietnamese invasion, he was reunited with his family. 
</P>
<P>
The story is told in a flat, dull monotone. But when the middle-aged man 
discusses his torture and the death of his children, he laughs. 
</P>
<P>
That reaction is a troubling problem among camp residents, according to Svang 
Tor, a Pol Pot victim who works with Mollica's team. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Khmer Rouge took power, they turned Cambodians against each other, 
turned children against their families, and everyone was afraid to speak," she 
said during a recent visit to Site 2. 
</P>
<P>
"They created what we call Tiing Moong, or the dummy personality. Someone who 
has no emotions, no thoughts, someone who wants only to survive and would do 
whatever (his masters) asked." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the signs of Tiing Moong are evident throughout Site 2. Khmer refugees 
are isolated from one another and do not trust even close family members. When 
memories become unbearable, many of them laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"The Cambodians have a saying that they have cried so much, they have no more 
tears. So they laugh," says Pendleton. "The pain is something they try to 
suppress." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, it erupts in violence, as with Chamleakana. But for others, the 
traumas of Pol Pot and Site 2 produce nothing but silence. On a recent drive 
through the camp, Pendleton visited a man in his hut who had not spoken for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said that the 47-year-old former soldier, known only as Ghea, lost a 
leg when he stepped on a land mine in battle. The man seemed to be adjusting to 
life in the camp but was greatly embarrassed 13 months ago when a radio he had 
borrowed from a friend was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers sensed his loss of face, a catastrophe in many Asian cultures, 
and replaced the radio. But Ghea was shattered, and he has not spoken a word 
since. He spends his days staring at the dirt floor, oblivious to the cries of 
his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
"That man needs psychiatric care, today," says Pendleton as he leaves Ghea's 
hut. "But every time somebody tries to take him to a hospital miles from here, 
he fights them off fiercely. We need some kind of care that could help him 
immediately, right in this camp." 
</P>
<P>
At Site 2, volunteer physicians and Khmer medics provide a level of care higher 
than that in Cambodia itself. But they do not offer comprehensive psychiatric 
services. Instead, severely disturbed people are referred to specialists in a 
refugee camp 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
The Mollica team found, however, that the mental health problems of many Site 2 
residents are not properly diagnosed. For example, patients suffering from 
depression and suicidal tendencies are treated for medical disorders, such as 
upset stomachs, and then released, the group concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this is traceable to the Khmer themselves, who are reluctant to seek 
out counseling. But Mollica also believes doctors and other medical workers 
should be trained to spot such cases. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to find a way to reach all of these people, but it has to be on their 
terms. A Western psychiatrist can't just walk into Khmer society and tell 
people how to live. It's got to be a delicate blend." 
</P>
<P>
In a darkened hut at Site 2, Phaly Nuon sits with a woman who has recently fled 
her home to escape a drunken, abusive husband. With her children in tow, she 
has come to the depression relief center in search of safety. 
</P>
<P>
Only a handful of women at Site 2 have used the shelter, and Nuon suspects that 
many others are suffering in silence. Still, the center is an example of the 
mental health care that Mollica and others would like to see expanded. 
</P>
<P>
When the battered woman sought help, she also was offered the use of 
traditional healing herbs. For thousands of years, Cambodian folk doctors known 
as Krou Khmer have created powerful concoctions from plants that relieve 
symptoms ranging from upset stomachs and headaches to hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how the Krou Khmer do it, but the Cambodians believe in it, and 
that's what's most important," physician Brandts says. "If we're going to work 
with them, we have to respect that tradition." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the center offered the woman "spiritual" counseling sessions to 
discuss her problems. Traditionally, Cambodians bring their personal problems 
to elders or Buddhist monks. Yet Barnabus Mam, a center employee, says talking 
about personal problems may catch on at Site 2. 
</P>
<P>
"We have suffered just like the people who now can come to see us," says Mam, 
who lost his parents, a brother and two sisters to the Khmer Rouge. "We 
understand them very well, you see, because we have all had the same 
nightmares." 
</P>
<P>
To combat mental health problems in Site 2, Mollica's proposal would blend all 
of these ingredients -- folk healing, religious consultation and Western-style 
counseling -- in a program relying heavily on the Khmer themselves. 
</P>
<P>
A key component would be the training of Cambodian mental health experts. These 
practitioners would spot telltale signs of emotional disturbance among patients 
and help prescribe remedies. They would be assisted by Krou Khmer healers, 
Buddhist monks and members of the depression relief center. 
</P>
<P>
"It might take 6 to 8 months before (a patient) speaks her mind," Mollica told 
an audience of Krou Khmer, center workers and Buddhist monks during a recent 
visit to Site 2. "But you have to be patient and be a compassionate listener. 
This is how we can begin to solve the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Will the mental health program make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
Marybeth McCarthy, a longtime relief worker who directs a recovery program for 
Site 2 alcoholics, says that any effort is welcome, regardless of its 
shortcomings. Looking back on a recent week of camp violence, including 
Chamleakana's murder of his wife and daughter, she shakes her head sadly. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these people are suffering because we have been ignoring their 
psychological problems for too long," McCarthy says. 
</P>
<P>
"That murder is just one story out of 140,000 in this place. One day, all of 
these stories will come out, including thousands we don't know about yet. And 
when they do, God help Cambodia." 
</P>

POP BEAT: FOR EX-BLACK SABBATH STAR BILL WARD, DEMONS ARE IN PAST; 
</P>
<P>
PERSONALITY: HIS LATEST ALBUM CELEBRATES THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW CAREER -- AND A

<P>
For most of his adult life, Bill Ward had a role to play and a ready-made mask 
to wear. 
</P>
<P>
The role was prominent, and highly remunerative: drummer for Black Sabbath, one 
of the earliest, most extravagantly popular heavy metal rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
The mask was what you would expect. 
</P>
<P>
"My ego wanted you to see this heavy metal monster -- Grrrr!" Ward said, hiking 
up his shoulders under a navy blue double-breasted blazer as he imitated a 
mad-dog rocker's growl. Then he smiled a tolerant smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I know who that guy was, and I look at him sometimes," Ward said Tuesday as he 
sat in a diner on Pacific Coast Highway, not far from his home a few blocks 
from the ocean in Seal Beach. "I go, 'Yeah, he was OK. But he was pretty messed 
up.' Bill Ward the drummer seems like a distant friend these days." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ward the Black Sabbath drummer died six years ago this week in an alleyway 
in Huntington Beach. Once he had been a millionaire rock star, living in a 
fine, 19th-Century home on a hill overlooking a village in his native England. 
Drinking took all that away. Eventually, Ward's alcohol addiction stripped him 
of his ability to function as a musician. Toward the end, it estranged him from 
his friends and family. In his last days, Ward the drinker lived in the streets 
of Huntington Beach, dogged by pneumonia, looking for a way out. He found it in 
that alley, where he stuck a borrowed 12-gauge shotgun in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have the courage to kill myself," Ward recalled softly. "But as a 
human being, I was already dead." 
</P>
<P>
The metal mad-dog drummer never made it out of that alley. In his place walked 
a man taking the first steps toward sobriety, and toward a new musical life in 
which the pounding headbanger drum beats still figure, but the mask is no 
longer required. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence of Ward's artistic rebirth is his first solo album, "Ward One: 
Along the Way." Released Wednesday by Chameleon Music Group, it is due in 
record stores next week. 
</P>
<P>
The album begins with the ominous crackle of an ambulance radio relaying grim 
medical reports -- a sound that Ward says became an almost routine part of his 
life in 1983 as it dwindled into a series of physical emergencies and mental 
crises fueled by his alcoholism. It ends with the sound of footsteps, first 
circumspect, but growing steadily stronger until the steps are joined by the 
sound of a light, optimistic whistle. In between, Ward's song cycle probes the 
dark, lonely tightrope walk of an addict struggling to reach for hope before he 
tumbles into despair. 
</P>
<P>
While much of "Ward One" recalls the brooding tone, wailing guitar and 
tromp-and-chug rhythms of vintage Black Sabbath, the album also has a strong 
adventurous streak that allows for an unflagging emphasis on melody, 
atmospheric textures that recall Pink Floyd, African rhythms not unlike Peter 
Gabriel's, and even the softness of a caressing rock lullaby. 
</P>
<P>
Ward sings lead vocals for the first time in his 22-year rock career, in a 
voice that is limited, but evocative after the manner of Roger Waters' dramatic 
singing in Pink Floyd (minus the screams). Ward gets some all-star help from 
Ozzy Osbourne, his old Black Sabbath band mate, and from Cream alumnus Jack 
Bruce, each of whom sings the lead on two songs. 
</P>
<P>
As a founding member of Black Sabbath, Ward had some creative input, but he 
faced nothing like the wide-ranging demands of writing, singing and arranging 
an album of his own. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I put in what I could, how I could," he said of his creative role in 
Black Sabbath, which Ward formed in 1968 along with Osbourne, bassist Terry 
(Geezer) Butler and guitarist Tony Iommi. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to writing songs with Black Sabbath, "I'd let things pass. I'd 
have an idea, and I'd keep it inside. Finding out what I'm capable of, what's 
inside -- that's what this album is about. There's been a whole discovery. I 
found a guy who had this inside him, but didn't know how to let it out." 
</P>
<P>
For Ward, 41, the process of finding a musical self began after he gained 
sobriety in 1984. First, he rejoined Butler and Iommi in Black Sabbath, but he 
soon quit the band, feeling that it had stagnated (Iommi still leads a rump 
version of Black Sabbath). Ward tried playing with other musicians for two 
years but failed to find a focus. 
</P>
<P>
Then, starting in 1987, he began work on "Ward One" with a nucleus of Southern 
California-based musicians, including guitarists Rue Phillips and Keith Lynch, 
who helped Ward write the music on several of the album's songs. 
</P>
<P>
Ward contacted Bruce and asked him to sing two songs, even though he had never 
met the former Cream singer-bassist. Bruce's clear, emotive tenor serves as the 
voice of comfort and encouragement on the lullaby, "Light Up the Candles," and 
on "Tall Stories," an affirmative rocker in which Ward writes of regaining the 
ability to play music. 
</P>
<P>
"Ozzy invited himself," Ward said. "He said, 'What's all this I hear about you 
doing an album? You haven't invited me.' " Ward turned the microphone over to 
Osbourne for the album's most Sabbath-like rockers, "Jack's Land" and the 
excellent "Bombers (Can Open Bomb Bays)." 
</P>
<P>
Osbourne, whose own successful solo career has been played out against 
continuing struggles with drug and alcohol abuse, is the voice of baleful 
warning in his two songs, expressing bleak visions of addiction's consequences, 
yet also pointing to hope and recovery as open paths. 
</P>
<P>
At least at the start, the guest stars and Sabbath connections will be a big 
part of the promotional strategy for Ward's album, according to Stephen Powers, 
president of Chameleon, the Hawthorne-based independent record label that has 
raised its profile with recent releases by Mary's Danish and John Lee Hooker. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to get out of the gate based on past history and associations," 
Powers said. "But our long-range goal is to develop Bill as an artist so they 
don't see this as a one-off where his friends came in and played and that's the 
only reason for the album." 
</P>
<P>
Ward wants no part of the metal-monster baggage that came with Black Sabbath, a 
band infamous for its dark musings, occult trappings and demonic imagery. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to do death any more. I don't want to do doom and gloom. I want 
to do life and love," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
"I want no burning skulls or demonic interest," he added, speaking of video 
plans. "Naked women running across the video set -- no thank you. Get somebody 
else to do that. I've had enough of that. If I get the opportunity to do any 
videos and you see any skulls in it, you can come over to my house and smack my 
head with a big shovel." 
</P>
<P>
Doom-laden imagery aside, Ward said he is still fond of Black Sabbath's 
head-banging sound. 
</P>
<P>
"I love its primitivism, its naivete," he said. "A very important rock band and 
a very good band. I love 'em. I can be a fan now. I can listen to it and be 
outside it." 
</P>
<P>
Ward acknowledges that he remains a fortunate Sabbath insider in one respect: 
royalties. "It's been a godsend. I get to feed the kids," he said of catalogue 
sales spurred by the advent of compact discs. "I'm hoping I can get in a 
position where I'm self-supporting from my own work." 
</P>
<P>
As his first album emerges, Ward is preparing for one of the last but most 
difficult steps along the way to a full comeback: touring. In the early '80s, 
an alcohol-fogged Ward was capable of suffering a nervous breakdown at the mere 
thought of touring. The drummer said he is putting together a band and road 
crew for a "noncommittal" round of live shows this spring. 
</P>
<P>
"I could still have mixed feelings" about touring, said Ward, a father of three 
who lives with his third wife and his two younger children in a quiet section 
of quaint Seal Beach, an old Navy town that couldn't be farther from the rock 
'n' roll fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I want to go a little slow. I'm looking for a place inside where I 
can say, 'Yeah, I feel OK about this.' I want to make the professional 
commitment. I want to work through the fears that I have about going on the 
road. That's my goal. If that trial run works, we'll get more committed." 
</P>
<P>
This time, Ward won't feel compelled to wear that old heavy metal monster's 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
"(With Black Sabbath) I felt I had to perform for everybody the way I thought 
they wanted me to be, instead of playing what I am. I feel I've begun to play 
what I am instead of playing safe. I'm letting myself be vulnerable nowadays. 
I'm being more of a human being these days."

CRITIC AT LARGE: RON HOWARD: THE GRATIFYING GROWTH OF A DIRECTOR; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: WITH THE SUCCESS OF 'PARENTHOOD,' THE FORMER CHILD STAR SAYS HE'S 
LEARNED THAT A FILM MUST HAVE 'SOMETHING TO SAY' TO BE ENTERTAINING.

<P>
One of the rewards of keeping an eye on Hollywood over a period of years is the 
chance to watch careers begin and flower, especially when the undertakings grow 
riskier and the achievements more impressive. You have to bite your tongue to 
keep from saying too often, "It seems like only yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
But it was not much more than the day before yesterday that the Jodie Foster of 
"The Accused" was a Disney moppet in "Napoleon and Samantha," for example, and 
Ron Howard a 9-year-old in Vincente Minnelli's "The Courtship of Eddie's 
Father," or Opie on "The Andy Griffith Show" and then Richie on "Happy Days." 
</P>
<P>
More recently, it has been possible to watch Howard's growth as a director, 
from his first feature, "Grand Theft Auto," a box-office winner for Roger 
Corman's company. It was followed by "Splash" and "Cocoon," both substantial 
hits, and "Willow," done with producer George Lucas, which did not do well but 
was a quite-amazing technical and logistical feat. 
</P>
<P>
Now Howard, who will be (only) 36 in March, has directed what appears to be his 
largest success, "Parenthood," which at a recent count had grossed close to 
$100 million. Howard, who lives in Connecticut with his wife, Cheryl, and their 
four children, was in Hollywood a few days ago on a regular visit to the 
Century City offices of Imagine Films, the production company he runs with 
partner Brian Grazer. 
</P>
<P>
He talked about the philosophical road that led to directing and "Parenthood." 
He was born in Oklahoma to acting parents Rance and Jean Howard (his father 
recently appeared in an American Express commercial) and grew up in a curiously 
mixed atmosphere of show biz and down-home Americana. 
</P>
<P>
Howard did his first stage walk-on in a Baltimore production of "The Seven-Year 
Itch" when he was just 2 and by his teens was an established star. But, he 
says, the family lived in Burbank, where his pals' parents worked for Lockheed 
or the Sheriff's Department and he went to Burroughs High. 
</P>
<P>
He worked on the school paper but he wasn't one of the gang. "The kids couldn't 
make up their minds whether it was cooler to hang out with me or to ignore me." 
The ignorers appear to have prevailed and it left Howard, he says, with a 
shyness that has not gone away. There is indeed less of a show-business aura 
around him than most of the waiters in Hollywood exude. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take him long to discover film making. Still in his teens, he took a 
second prize nationally in an Eastman Kodak competition that involved shooting 
a roll of Super-8 film and sending it undeveloped to the company. It was 
planning and editing in the camera with a vengeance. He made a thriller, "Deed 
of Derring Do," co-starring with his brother Clint, now also an actor. "There 
were 37 cuts," he remembers with some pride. 
</P>
<P>
He was accepted at the USC Film School and talked his way into advanced classes 
in editing and production. "American Graffiti" and other gigs took him away 
before he finished but, Howard says, "Going to film school opened my mind to 
another level of thinking about movies. Nobody around the Griffith show spent a 
lot of time talking about metaphors and symbols." 
</P>
<P>
(Years later, when Howard, George Lucas and writer Bob Dolman told the plot of 
"Willow" to the late philosopher Joseph Campbell, Howard says, "Campbell 
identified all the themes and symbols.") 
</P>
<P>
Like other actors-turned-directors, Howard learned a lot from the men he worked 
for. He remembers Minnelli's patient attention to details, the time he spent 
looking through the camera, demanding a different-shaped watch for Howard's 
wrist. He found the same meticulous attention to casting -- both people and 
cars -- when George Lucas made "Graffiti." From Don Siegel on "The Shootist" 
there were lessons in "bold choices, for the camera and in staging." 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, Howard discovered, "You tend to make your actors into 
puppets. It took a while to learn how little you have to say, and usually the 
less the better." 
</P>
<P>
He made as well the obvious discovery that you have to back up the story 
visually. "As an actor, I suppose I was late in coming to the idea that it's 
more than shooting faces. You can use visuals to get laughs, and create 
emotions." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things that worried him about "Parenthood" was that "a lot of the 
time there was nothing between the actors and the audience except the camera. 
That was scary after all the special effects I'd dealt with in 'Cocoon' and 
'Willow.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he and partner Grazer thought that "Parenthood" might well break even 
but was not likely to do a lot better than that. "We figured everybody might 
get their money back," Howard says. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he had made still another discovery along the way: "A film 
isn't even going to be entertaining if it doesn't have something to say. People 
never want to be bored; they want to be captured, engaged. We just had to hope 
that the simple idea we were putting out there -- that parenting is really 
tough -- would hold up. We weren't even going for nonstop comedy. There were 
great stretches of people just talking." 
</P>
<P>
"Parenthood" has been particularly pleasing to Howard because it was the first 
time he was dealing not with received material but with an idea that he and his 
regular writing partners, Babaloo Mandel and Lowell Ganz, had developed from 
scratch out of their own parenting experiences. Mandel and Ganz have nine 
children between them and Mandel's wife was expecting triplets as the script 
was in process. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to have called it 'Great Expectations,' " Howard says, grinning, 
"because it's about the expectations we all have, not only for our children but 
for ourselves as parents, as against the reality of experience. That pull 
between the expectations and the reality, you have to accept it and come to 
peace with it. And that other thing we were about was the corny notion that 
being a parent is good, hard but heroic work." 
</P>
<P>
It interests Howard that today's parents have a harder time telling their kids 
what it is they do. "In the old days, the son followed his father on the farm. 
These days, your kids wonder what kind of work is talking on the telephone. One 
day I took home a working cassette of the film I was doing and showed it to the 
kids and my daughter said, 'Ah, that's what you do.' " 
</P>
<P>
Howard's theory about comedy is that "you have to earn the right to do 
something outlandish. If you get the audience to relate to the characters and 
the situation, then you can have someone fall off the roof and not be killed" 
(as Steve Martin does in "Parenthood"). 
</P>
<P>
"There's a balance between relatability and full-out high entertainment. I 
believe in trying to keep the balance." 
</P>
<P>
He'd like to work his way through all the genres, Howard say, staying with 
character-centered stories, dealing with material he can relate to himself, and 
stretching himself on fresh challenges. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure you ever feel you've got the process licked. But I like to learn 
as much as I can," Howard says, looking as earnest as a kid from Mayberry.

STAGE WATCH: CIGARETTE WARNINGS POPPING UP AT LATC; 'MARRY ME,' 'MEETIN'S ON 
THE PORCH' TO OPEN 
</P>

"Cigarettes will be smoked during this performance." 
</P>
<P>
The lobby signs at Los Angeles Theatre Center warn playgoers that the actors on 
stage will light up during the action. Those who are sensitive to secondhand 
smoke should beware. 
</P>
<P>
The smoke signals are more and more common at LATC. They were spotted near the 
doors of the theaters housing the current "Once in Doubt" and the recent "Death 
of a Salesman." LATC artistic director Bill Bushnell said he believes the 
warnings began with last year's "Demon Wine," which included a lot of cigar 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
The signs are "the result of audience concerns," said Bushnell -- which is to 
say, "a vehement feeling, on the part of a small group, that they want to be 
warned if they'll be in a closed room with smoke, even if the ventilation is 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
If playgoers see the warnings soon enough, they might be able to exchange seats 
near the front of the theater for seats near the rear, or even for seats at 
another show in the four-theater complex. Box-office treasurer Sarah Katz said 
she has made such ticket exchanges, but no one had ever requested a refund over 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bushnell said he knew of no other theater that regularly warns playgoers of 
on-stage smoking. "Maybe nobody else listens to their audience," he speculated. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Mark Taper Forum, the Ahmanson and Doolittle, Pasadena 
Playhouse and the Old Globe confirmed that they don't issue warnings about 
onstage smoking, as they often do regarding gunshots and strobe lights. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla Playhouse posted a warning for "Nebraska" when it was at the 248-seat 
Warren Theatre last year, but it doesn't post smoking warnings in the larger 
Mandell Weiss Center. 
</P>
<P>
A South Coast Repertory representative reported that a few audience members had 
complained about the smoke rising from the set of "V and V Only" in 1988. But 
the theater does not post tobacco warnings. 
</P>
<P>
So LATC is the only major Southland theater where the warnings are routine. 
This is the same theater where nudity offended some playgoers during "Minimata" 
last year, and where graphic language often is heard, including explicit sexual 
talk in "Once in Doubt." But no signs are posted about nudity or language. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the human body does or should offend people," said Bushnell. 
</P>
<P>
COMING UP: A couple of shows open in often-dark mid-sized theaters this month. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coronet in West Hollywood, "Marry Me a Little," the Stephen Sondheim 
outtakes revue, will open an indefinite run Tuesday, produced by Norman Maibaum 
and Edward H. Davis. It will be their first production at the Coronet since 
they took over the lease in May; other shows seen there recently have been 
rentals. 
</P>
<P>
This version of the show adds three new songs "by special arrangement" with 
Sondheim and Craig Lucas, who conceived and developed the original show in 1980 
with Norman Rene. Actors Cynthia Gates and Kevin McMahon developed this staging 
at Theatre West, then did at two theaters into San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Patty Duke, Susan Clark and Carrie Snodgress will star in "Meetin's on the 
Porch," a play about three small-town women during the first half of the 
century, opening at the Canon Theater in Beverly Hills Jan. 24. Author Donald 
MacKechnie is co-directing with Richard Olivier, son of the late Laurence 
Olivier. 
</P>
<P>
"CHESS" CHECK: The producers of the touring production of "Chess," the Tim Rice 
musical about an international chess competition, have announced dates in Los 
Angeles (July 18-Sept. 2) and in Costa Mesa at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center (Sept. 4-9). However, their publicist acknowledged that no theater 
has been booked for the Los Angeles dates. And while the publicist asserted 
that the Orange County dates were firm, an Orange County Performing Arts Center 
publicist said those dates, too, "are still in negotiation." Des McAnuff of La 
Jolla Playhouse is directing the touring production, which opens Wednesdayin 
Miami Beach.

BABY-SITTER, HUSBAND ARRESTED IN DEATH OF 2 1/2-MONTH-OLD GIRL

<P>
A 61-year-old Van Nuys baby-sitter and her 75-year-old husband were in jail 
this morning after an infant in their care died and investigators found 
possible signs of child abuse, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
Theresa and Jose del Gado were arrested on suspicion of murder Wednesday night 
after 2 1/2-month-old Evelyn Figueroa stopped breathing in their apartment and 
was later pronounced dead at Panorama Community Hospital, said Detective Jim 
Vojtecky. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were being held without bail in the Van Nuys jail. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were called to the hospital at 5:30 p.m. after staff members 
found bruises on the head and face of the child, Vojtecky said. Vojtecky said 
the cause of the child's death is unknown and the results of an autopsy will 
likely determine whether the Del Gados will be charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
"The injuries appear minor," the detective said. "We are talking about slight 
bruising. When you are dealing with a young child, it is difficult" to 
determine if bruises are fatal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Vojtecky said the Del Gados denied injuring the child, who was left in their 
care by her mother, Susana Espina, 24.

SOVIET OFFICIAL QUESTIONS U.S. RIGHT TO TRY NORIEGA

<P>
A Soviet spokesman today questioned whether the United States has the right to 
put Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on trial and said that even a conviction on 
drug charges would not justify the U.S. invasion of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"No state has the right to take the law into its own hands," Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said. "That's basically lynch law." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, the former military leader of Panama, surrendered to American 
authorities in Panama City on Wednesday night and was taken to the United 
States, where he faces federal drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, Gerasimov questioned whether an American court 
has the right to try Noriega and said the United States has already committed 
several violations of international law by invading Panama on Dec. 20 and 
removing the ousted dictator for trial. 
</P>
<P>
The trial will involve "a violation of the rights of the government of Panama, 
a violation of the principles of nonintervention of the charter of the United 
Nations," Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said that "from the outside," the American capture of Noriega looked 
like government vengeance against a former CIA agent who got away. 
</P>
<P>
"We think that Gen. Noriega used to be a CIA agent," Gerasimov said. "And as 
your President Roosevelt said about (the late Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio) 
Somoza, he's an S.O.B., but he's our S.O.B. So this particular S.O.B. was your 
S.O.B. and then he went astray and now you want to capture him." 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov also said it appears that the real issue at stake in the American 
invasion was not catching an alleged drug kingpin but trying to hold onto the 
Panama Canal, which is due to revert to Panamanian control in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
He added that even if Noriega is found guilty of drug trafficking, armed 
intervention is still "not how things should be done. That's not how the 
struggle with drug business should be waged." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet media have regularly given factual reports on the invasion of Panama and 
attempts to capture Noriega.

<P>
Fallen Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega refused today to recognize the 
jurisdiction of a U.S. court and a judge entered a plea of not guilty on 
charges that he took $4.6 million to turn his nation into a way station for the 
cocaine trade. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega surrendered Wednesday night to U.S. troops outside Panama City's 
Vatican Embassy 10 days after he took refuge there, and was flown into 
Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami under cover of night. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. marshals with binoculars scanned the downtown area continuously from atop 
the federal courthouse and patrolled halls in plain clothes, but otherwise kept 
a low profile in what U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said was an 
effort to treat Noriega like any other defendant. 
</P>
<P>
His attorneys, however, argued that he is anything but a normal drug suspect. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot submit to the jurisdiction of this court. Gen. Noriega will stand 
mute at the arraignment," defense attorney Frank Rubino said as he and 
co-counsel Steven Kollin waited to see their client for the first time since 
his surrender. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly a year ago, Hoeveler had ruled that the United States has jurisdiction 
over Noriega, rejecting defense claims of immunity for a head of state. The 
judge said the State Department never recognized Noriega's political 
legitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
Kollin has noted other potential legal pitfalls in the case, including extreme 
pretrial publicity and Noriega's links with U.S. intelligence agencies, but 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said he was confident the case was solid. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush and other White 
House officials will be careful about what they say lest they prejudice the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's surrender was met with joyous celebrations in the streets of Panama 
City and Miami that continued today. 
</P>
<P>
The general -- who had ruled for six years, thumbed his nose at two U.S. 
Presidents and annulled a 1989 election he apparently was losing -- gave up, 
still wearing his military uniform, after realizing even his supporters had 
turned against him, the archbishop of Panama, Marcos McGrath, said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is leaving our 
land," said Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, frequently a target of 
Noriega's thugs. 
</P>
<P>
An indictment accuses Noriega, who is in his 50s, of accepting $4.6 million in 
bribes from Colombian drug cartels to aid and protect their smuggling and 
processing -- charges that carry 145 years in prison and $1.1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega is not covered by the new U.S. law allowing execution of drug kingpins, 
an assurance he reportedly demanded before turning himself in. He also faces 
drug charges in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment names 15 other people, including the reputed head of the 
Medellin cocaine cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, who is being hunted by 
Colombian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
One of Noriega's right-hand men, Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, surrendered to U.S. 
troops after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama and has pleaded innocent. 
Prosecutors have refused to say if he will testify against his former boss. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops who seized Noriega's military headquarters in Panama City 
reportedly found documents and files supporting the prosecution case. 
</P>
<P>
That, along with the arrests of Del Cid and other minor figures, has made the 
case stronger than when the indictment was issued two years ago, said Richard 
Gregorie, who headed the investigation until he left the U.S. attorney's office 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said today that Noriega was handcuffed and advised of his legal 
rights as an accused drug trafficker as he flew back to the United States under 
jet fighter escort. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Noriega traded his general's uniform for a one-piece flight 
suit and took off in an Air Force C-130 for Miami only 43 minutes after he 
surrendered to U.S. troops at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
The troops took Noriega from the embassy to Howard Air Base in a helicopter and 
turned him over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials before he was 
put aboard the C-130, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"On board the plane, two U.S. military doctors examined him and pronounced him 
fit to fly," Williams said, adding that Noriega was made to trade his brown 
slacks and tan shirt with military emblems for a zippered Air Force flight 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Fitzwater told reporters that Noriega was handcuffed at 
one point, although he could not say how long the handcuffs were kept on. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel told reporters a DEA agent read 
Noriega his constitutional rights in Spanish aboard the plane after it took 
off, taking Noriega to Florida to face drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel was unable to say whether the agent questioned Noriega after telling him 
he had the right to remain silent or to have an attorney present during 
questioning.

2ND MISTRIAL IN '82 MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A second mistrial was declared today in the case of a British citizen charged 
with murdering four members of a Northridge family who disappeared in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin declared the mistrial after ruling that 
Deputy Public Defender Mark Lessem had a conflict of interest and could no 
longer represent Harvey Rader, 47. 
</P>
<P>
The conflict involved a key prosecution witness, Robert Williams, who had 
recently been represented in a drunken driving case by the public defender's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
Chirlin declared the mistrial on the second day of Rader's second trial. 
Rader's first trial ended in a mistrial Aug. 31 after a Superior Court jury 
deadlocked 11-1 to convict him in the murders of Israeli immigrant Shlomo 
Salomon, 35; his wife, Elaine, and their two children, Michalle, 15, and 
Mitchell, 9.

HONECKER'S HOUSE ARREST ORDER LIFTED; 
</P>
<P>
E. GERMANY: HARD-LINE COMMUNIST LEADER EXPECTED TO QUIT PLUSH RESIDENCE SOON.

<P>
East German authorities have lifted a month-old house arrest order against 
former leader Erich Honecker, saying the measure had no legal basis, the 
official East German news agency ADN said today. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker, 77, the hard-line Communist leader who resigned under massive 
pressure Oct. 18, is expected to move out of his residence in the elite East 
Berlin suburb of Wandlitz soon, and ADN said he has been offered an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The authorities put the former leader under house arrest early in December at 
the height of a scandal over alleged corruption and abuses of power by Honecker 
and other former party and government officials. 
</P>
<P>
Honecker and other officials were accused of having abused their positions to 
live in luxury on sprawling estates, throwing lavish parties and going hunting 
in well-stocked private woods. 
</P>
<P>
ADN said today that the authorities lifted the order against Honecker, saying, 
"This measure cannot be legally supported." 
</P>
<P>
It did not say whether similar measures taken against other former officials 
also were lifted and gave no other details. 
</P>
<P>
A few days after placing Honecker under house arrest, the authorities announced 
they had started legal proceedings against the former head of state and 
Communist Party leader and arrested other former officials on charges of 
profiteering. 
</P>
<P>
East German authorities also announced last month they were turning the 
Wandlitz suburb, which once was reserved for senior party and government 
officials, into a home for the handicapped.

NORIEGA BODYGUARD OVERHEARD INVASION DISCUSSED, U.S. SAYS

A bodyguard to Manuel Antonio Noriega overheard two U.S. servicemen discussing 
the invasion of Panama hours before it occurred, a Pentagon spokesman said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear, however, whether the guard relayed that information to Noriega 
or whether the incident played any role in the U.S. failure to capture Noriega 
in the days after the invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"There is some evidence that some officials may have had some advance thought 
that this operation was about to happen. But there isn't a lot of evidence that 
actions were taken as a result of that," Defense Department spokesman Pete 
Williams told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"A bodyguard during a debriefing interview said that two U.S. soldiers had been 
overheard discussing their positions for H-hour. And that supposedly happened 
at 10 p.m., three hours before the attack was to begin," Williams said.

NORIEGA WILL BE SAFE, BUSH ASSURES POPE;

<P>
President Bush personally assured Pope John Paul II today that ousted 
Panamanian military ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega will receive all the 
protection of U.S. laws and be given a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, describing Bush as "fairly upbeat" 
after Noriega's surrender to U.S. authorities Wednesday night, said the 
President gave the assurances during a telephone call to the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater also said the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Army Gen. Colin 
L. Powell, was on his way to Panama to discuss U.S. troop withdrawals now that 
the United States has achieved the objectives of its Dec. 20 invasion of the 
Central American country. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said 2,000 of the 12,000 troops sent to Panama for the invasion 
have been removed, replaced by 2,000 military personnel given civilian, 
noncombat duties. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater predicted "a fairly steady stream of withdrawals over the next 
several weeks." About 12,000 troops regularly stationed in Panama will remain 
after the withdrawal is completed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who also telephoned Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney today to 
express gratitude for Ottawa's support, thanked the pontiff for the 
"distinguished efforts of the Vatican" to end the stalemate over Noriega, 
Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
"He assured the Pope that Gen. Noriega would be treated to all the protections 
of U.S. law and receive a fair trial," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman said the Vatican sought and received public U.S. 
assurances last week that the charges facing Noriega do not carry the death 
penalty. He said that the United States never negotiated with Noriega and that 
"there were no concessions or deals as far as the United States is concerned" 
to get Noriega to voluntarily give himself up. 
</P>
<P>
The deposed leader's surrender in Panama City and transfer to Florida to face 
drug charges that carry a maximum sentence of 145 years in prison ended a 10 
day-siege at the Vatican Embassy, where Noriega had taken refuge from U.S. 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's apprehension climaxed almost two years of U.S. efforts to bring him 
to trial in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, at his daily news briefing today, provided additional details of 
Noriega's surrender to U.S. troops who were ringing the Vatican Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega was handcuffed after he was taken into custody, advised in Spanish of 
his legal rights and examined by U.S. military doctors who found that he had 
"no discernible abnormalities and appeared to be in good health," Fitzwater 
said.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted today to consider a proposed 
rule that would place limited restrictions on the controversial practice of 
dual trading, where futures brokers trade for themselves and their customers. 
</P>
<P>
The five-member CFTC, which oversees the futures industry, voted unanimously to 
submit for public comment a proposed rule that would phase in some limits on 
dual trading over a 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
The rules change would be extended or pulled back based on a continuing review 
of the initial limitations, according to the proposal that will be reexamined 
after a 90-day public comment period.

Apple Computer Inc. said today its board of directors has approved the 
repurchase of up to 2.5 million additional shares of common stock. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing open-market purchases are part of a program announced last August 
when Apple's board first authorized the purchase of 2.5 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said the purchase 
"represents good long-term value to our shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Apple projected a decline in earnings in the first quarter of 
fiscal 1990 and said sales will grow more slowly than previously predicted. 
</P>
<P>
That announcement surprised industry watchers, coming just two weeks after a 
top executive of the personal computer maker told security analysts in New York 
that it expected worldwide sales growth of more than 20%.

A producer is suing Ron Kovic, the Vietnam veteran whose autobiography was made 
into the film "Born on the Fourth of July," contending that the author sold him 
the movie rights and then failed to help make the film. 
</P>
<P>
Mel Goldberg, in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Superior Court in Los Angeles, 
alleges that Kovic sold him the film rights to the book in 1985 and agreed to 
put Goldberg in touch with such Hollywood figures as actors and potential 
financiers. 
</P>
<P>
Goldberg contends that Kovic breached the contract by never setting up meetings 
and failing to allow renewal of the movie option. He is seeking $1 million in 
general damages and unspecified punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls to Kovic were not immediately returned. 
</P>

"Born on the Fourth of July," starring Tom Cruise as the young soldier who 
returns from Vietnam as a paraplegic, was released last month by Universal 
Pictures.

<TEXT>
<P>
Richard Chamberlain's Hawaii-based medical series is undergoing cosmetic 
surgery to make it more attractive to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
In the near future, his character of Dr. Daniel Kulani in "Island Son" will 
spend more time away from the hospital and become more involved with people. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS show also has new opening credits and new music. That went into effect 
when "Island Son" moved from Tuesday to Thursday in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
"When we go back into production after the first of the year, we'll open up the 
show and spend more time out of the hospital," said Chamberlain late last 
month. "You'll see those changes around February." 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain said this will take "Island Son" closer to its original concept of 
a man who was educated in modern medicine yet still honors the Hawaii 
traditions and folk medicine of his upbringing. 
</P>
<P>
"These are things we've been asking for for a long time," he said. "The drop in 
the ratings seems to support me. 
</P>
<P>
"Even doctors have a life outside the hospital, which may come as a surprise to 
some people. I'll be involved in closer relationships with the residents, and 
some surprising things will happen in my life. My ex-wife is going to come back 
and cause me some severe emotional difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
Besides family and human relations, the show will have fast cars and martial 
arts.

IN TV TRADITION, DUFFY DELIVERS ON 'NEWHART' 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's been a busy season for Julia Duffy: Her real-life son was born in August 
and her fictional child arrives on CBS' "Newhart" Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel was the second child for Duffy, the petite blonde actress who plays 
self-absorbed Stephanie Vanderkellen-Harris on the comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
The birth Monday will be the first for Stephanie and her husband, Michael 
Harris, played by Peter Scolari. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a baby before on a show," said Duffy. In the next several 
weeks, she'll have two: on "Newhart" and in a CBS movie, "The Love Boat: A 
Valentine Voyage," on Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm typecast," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The entire "Newhart" show is built around the birth. "When I go into labor 
Michael tries to tape the birth with his video camera. I get mad and throw him 
out of the delivery room," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael does everything in excess. Duffy explains: "He shows up with a 15-man 
news crew, all scrubbed down and wearing green surgical gowns." 
</P>
<P>
Duffy declined to give any details about the child, saying, "If you want to 
know the sex of the baby, tune in." The baby, however, will be on view briefly 
in the next week's episode. The focus of the show goes back to Bob Newhart and 
those at the Stratford Inn in Norwich, Vt. 
</P>
<P>
It'll be the second birth on a CBS comedy show this year. Charlene Frazier 
Stillfield, played by Jean Smart, had a daughter on a special one-hour episode 
of "Designing Women" this past Monday. On the show, she's married to Doug Barr, 
but in real life she's married to Richard Gilliland. They had a son, Connor 
Douglas, in October. 
</P>
<P>
Combining pregnancies, real and fictional, is nothing new for television. On 
NBC's "Cheers," Carla (Rhea Perlman) has had three births. Jane Carr of NBC's 
"Dear John" and Anne Schedeen of NBC's "ALF" also have had babies on their 
shows to coincide with real births. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous birth of all was that of Little Ricky on "I Love Lucy" on Jan. 
19, 1953. That same night Lucille Ball gave birth to Desiderio Alberto Arnaz 
IV. The event nearly knocked the inauguration of President Eisenhower off Page 
One the next day.

West German painter Anselm Kiefer has been awarded the $100,000 Wolf Prize in 
the arts. Kiefer will be presented the prize by Israeli President Chaim Herzog 
in May at the Knesset, or Parliament, the Israel-based foundation said. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement said Kiefer, who was born in 1945, "has created an art that 
synthesizes human history and the present condition of life in epic canvases 
that inspire gravity and awe." 
</P>
<P>
It noted that Kiefer first came to prominence in the 1970s "with subjects that

DONNA RICE NOW 'BORN-AGAIN'

<TEXT>
<P>
Donna Rice, a household name after reporters found she spent a weekend with 
Gary Hart, has become a "born-again" Christian who spends much of her time 
doing charitable work, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of Rice's, Andy Messing, told the Washington Times in a story 
Wednesday that she "went back to her roots and because she did, she wound up 
coming out of a tailspin that would have killed other people." 
</P>
<P>
Rice, 32, who declined to be interviewed for the story, became an instant 
celebrity in 1987 when her relationship with Hart was publicized. Hart dropped 
out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and later made an 
unsuccessful re-entry into the contest. 
</P>
<P>
Rice now lives with a female friend in northern Virginia. The newspaper said 
she doesn't have a full-time paying job, and quoted friends as saying she has 
become quietly involved in charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also said she has a boyfriend and attends some of Washington's 
high-profile dinners and events. 
</P>
<P>
"Donna . . . not gone through that much of a change," said Tricia Erickson, 
head of a McLean, Va., modeling agency and Rice's designated crisis manager in 
1987. "I don't think that she 'went to God,' so to speak. Donna's always been 
like that. It isn't some miraculous thing."

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MORE EXCITING DRUG BREAKTHROUGHS FORESEEN FOR 1990S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON and DR. TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The drug breakthroughs during the last decade have been extraordinary, but the 
outlook for the 1990s is even more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back over the past 10 years, we have seen a revolution in ulcer 
therapy. The most successful drugs of the '80s were Zantac (ranitidine) and 
Tagamet (cimetidine) -- both topped annuals sales of a billion dollars, the 
first drugs in history to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Blood pressure control became easier with the development of two new classes of 
medicine. The ACE enzyme inhibitors Capoten (captopril) and Vasotec (enalapril) 
along with the calcium antagonists Cardizem (diltiazem), Procardia (nifedipine) 
and Calan and Isoptin (verapamil) have given physicians valuable new tools in 
their fight against hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
Clot busters like Activase and Streptase are reversing heart attacks that would 
have killed or crippled people 10 years ago. And new research showed that an 
old drug, aspirin, could dramatically reduce the risk of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Sexually transmitted diseases captured headlines during the decade just past. 
First herpes, then AIDS stimulated drug researchers to develop Zovirax 
(acyclovir) and Retrovir (zidovudine or AZT). Although these drugs aren't 
cures, they proved that antiviral drug development has promise. 
</P>
<P>
New antidepressants like Prozac (fluoxetine) and Wellbutrin (bupropion) offered 
relief without the usual side effects. And non-sedating antihistamines like 
Seldane (terfenadine) and Hismanal (astemizole) allowed allergy victims relief 
without drowsiness. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the baby boom generation woke up to discover that it was aging. 
Rogaine Topical Solution (minoxidil) disproved the dermatological dogma that 
baldness was irreversible. And the acne medicine Retin-A undid excess sun 
exposure by reversing wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
But as exciting as the '80s were for pharmaceutical innovation, the 1990s offer 
even greater breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of men with enlarged prostate glands may benefit from Proscar 
(finasteride), a drug that may also prove beneficial against male pattern 
baldness and acne. 
</P>
<P>
Drug companies are aggressively pursuing treatments for Alzheimer's disease and 
other brain disorders of aging. 
</P>
<P>
Lazaroids (named after the biblical character Lazarus who rose from the dead) 
represent an exciting new class of compounds that may preserve the heart and 
brain from injury during a heart attack or stroke. 
</P>
<P>
Other conditions that may yield to new therapies include osteoporosis, migraine 
headaches, schizophrenia, arthritis, asthma and heart disease. If researchers 
are able to deliver on a fraction of the promising agents now in development, a 
new age of drug breakthroughs lies ahead.

Work has begun on a new house for Mickey Spillane to replace the one destroyed 
by Hurricane Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery writer has joked that his former home "looked like Godzilla took a 
walk all through that place." 
</P>
<P>
Spillane and his wife, Jane, watched the start of work Wednesday while stakes 
were planted and the areas of the rooms were roped off. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going way up on stilts. It's going to be a bigger house but with more of 
a country flavor and facing the water," Jane Spillane said. 
</P>
<P>
The author has said he waited 19 years to write his latest book, "The Killing 
Man," because "I was doing OK and didn't really need the money." 
</P>
<P>
"After (Hurricane Hugo) I needed the money very badly," he said.

William &amp; Mary football Coach Jimmye Laycock has interviewed for the 
coaching job at Navy, according to a published report today. 
</P>
<P>
Laycock, who coached William &amp; Mary to an 8-3-1 record in 1989, was the 
second to interview for the post. 
</P>
<P>
Sources told the Baltimore Sun that Laycock met with the athletic board 
Wednesday. Laycock interviewed for the Navy job the last time it was open, 
after Gary Tranquill was not offered a new contract after the 1986 season. 
</P>
<P>
Laycock is the second candidate known to have been invited to the academy to 
meet with board members. Former Detroit Lions Coach Darryl Rogers interviewed 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Navy fired Elliot Uzelac last month and has set a Jan. 12 deadline for hiring a 
new coach. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates are Virginia assistant Coach Tim O'Brien and Gene Stallings, 
former Phoenix Cardinals coach.

Chucky Mullins, a University of Mississippi football player paralyzed by a

Doctors at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis said the surgery, performed

Mullins, who has been paralyzed from the shoulders down since the Oct. 28 game, 
was reported doing well after the surgery.

Dr. Clarence Watridge said the surgery removed pieces of two vertebrae and some 
bone fragments from Mullins' spinal cord. Doctors said the surgery could help

COLLEGE SUPER BOWL? NO! LET'S GIVE PLAYERS A LITTLE TIME TO STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of those unscientific, color-coded telephone polls in USA Today showed 
recently that most red-blooded Americans favor a college football playoff. 
</P>
<P>
This is no more a surprise than a poll favoring free beer or a date with 
Michelle Pfeiffer. Division I college football is an aberration, and not for, 
say, its moral standing. What big-time college football does each year is leave 
you hanging. It refuses to satisfy. It's a tease in pads and helmet. 
</P>
<P>
All the other sports (including divisions II and III football) eventually 
arrive at a satisfactory conclusion, with some manner of tournament from which 
a winner, a champion, emerges. You can start with the big-league World Series 
and work your way down to the Little League version. We get a clear-cut winner 
and losers equally clear cut, and that's the way we like our sports. 
</P>
<P>
College basketball provides us with a tournament champion. So does college 
soccer. And baseball. And lacrosse. Debate teams. Even cheerleaders have 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
Only college football demurs. 
</P>
<P>
In football, we rely primarily on two polls, one of sportswriters and the other 
of football coaches, to determine a national champion. It's not the greatest 
system devised by man. Football coaches generally leave the voting to their 
sports information directors. And how many different teams can a sportswriter, 
even one with cable, see in a season? Besides, would you want anything really 
important decided by sportswriters? Or football coaches? 
</P>
<P>
This season happens to be spectacularly confusing. Among the principal 
contenders for national honors, Florida State beat Miami, which beat Notre 
Dame, which beat Colorado. Does that make Florida State champion? No. Florida 
State has lost twice this season. Colorado lost once, but it made the mistake 
of losing its final game, a slip that pollsters tend to notice. Once-beaten 
Notre Dame played the toughest schedule but lost to once-beaten Miami in 
December, meaning Miami is the champion, or so the voters proclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
But are the bad boys from Miami the best team, or do they simply have the best 
timing? 
</P>
<P>
Why not, you're probably thinking, take this college football Final Four to 
some warm-weather clime, play one weekend to get down to a Final Two and then 
have a college Super Bowl to settle this thing like men? 
</P>
<P>
Well, there are many reasons why not. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, on a philosophical note, what's wrong with a little disorder? 
Must we have everything tied into neat little packages? Does two plus two 
always have to equal four? 
</P>
<P>
A college football playoff would necessarily interfere with bowl games. Do we 
really want to jeopardize a system that has given corporate sponsors so many 
years of pleasure? And what about parades. Would there be a college Super Bowl 
parade? I doubt it. The present bowl system, our country's greatest growth 
industry, basically allows alumni from virtually every college in America to 
visit someplace warm sometime in December. This not only feeds the economy, but 
it also helps conserve oil. We must therefore tread gently in this area. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there is the small matter of academics. E. Gordon Gee, 
president of the University of Colorado, wrote in the New York Times on Sunday 
that "colleges and universities must stand first for academic values." He went 
on to write that a college Super Bowl would be the "ultimate sellout." 
</P>
<P>
Gee is absolutely right. Even college officials have finally come to recognize 
that most sports seasons have grown too long. They have commissioned studies 
that show athletes who want to be students don't have enough time to do both. 
Witness the case of Lou Holtz, who affects concern for the athlete as student. 
Two players who missed practice to catch up on their studies were not allowed 
to play in the Orange Bowl. That's a great message. But a worse message would 
be to add games, even playoff games, or maybe especially playoff games, to a 
season that is already too long.

PANKEY GAME PLAN: STOP TAYLOR; 
</P>
<P>
PLAYOFFS: IF THE RAMS' OFFENSIVE TACKLE DOES HIS JOB WELL, HE WON'T GET MUCH 
TELEVISION TIME, BUT HE WILL BE PIVOTAL AS L.A. TAKES ON THE GIANTS.

<P>
Irv Pankey has the kind of dirty but thankless job that generally goes 
unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
He wants to keep it that way Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Pankey, the Rams' offensive left tackle, knows he will hardly be mentioned if 
he does a good job in the playoff game against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
But if he lets New York linebacker Lawrence Taylor get a couple of sacks, 
Pankey figures to be prominently featured on national television. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it always works at offensive tackle. You let him get a sack and 
John Madden will be drawing a diagram and they'll run it back in slow motion," 
said Pankey, the man primarily charged with the responsible for keeping Taylor 
out of Ram quarterback Jim Everett's face. 
</P>
<P>
The Pankey-Taylor match-up is considered one of the keys in the NFC semifinal 
playoff game, based on the fact that the usually dominant linebacker wasn't 
much of a factor in the last two meetings between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams beat the Giants 45-31 in September, 1988, at the Meadowlands, then 
handed them a 31-10 loss last November at Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
New York's defense had a total of two sacks in those games, and, in the recent 
meeting, Pankey helped limit Taylor to just two tackles and no sacks. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pankey, a 6-foot-5, 280-pounder in his 10th NFL season, knows he'll 
have a battle on his hands in the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't look back at the past because every game is different, even if 
you're playing the same guy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he (Taylor) will be ready to play. They're going to be on their home 
turf, and they're going to be well-rested." 
</P>
<P>
Pankey said he will try to take Taylor "out of his rhythm" but added that he's 
making no special preparations to play against him. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't prepare for any particular player; you might not prepare well for a 
guy that doesn't have the name of Lawrence Taylor, and that guy might push you 
around," Pankey said. 
</P>
<P>
"I prepare myself for every game like I'm going against Lawrence Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think more about what I'm doing; if I can take care of what I'm supposed to, 
everything will work out." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Rams and Giants both have been diplomatic to a fault as their 
playoff contest approaches, with no war of words before this game, Pankey did 
take issue with one quote attributed to Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Told that Taylor has said that he, Taylor, has slowed a step, Pankey at first 
said, "Well, he's been in the league for nine years and he's been in on an 
awful lot of tackles. . . . Heck, I'm slower than I was." 
</P>
<P>
But Pankey then added, "I don't think he's a step slower; maybe the younger 
guys coming in now are just a little bit faster."

flawless. The worst of its problems are these:

* Schedules. Notre Dame Coach Lew Holtz is right; playing a tough schedule 
hurts a team's chances of finishing No. 1 because it is more difficult to go 
unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
* Voting criteria. Poll voters have no uniform guidelines to work with. Some 
look at scheduling, but as Miami's championship proves, more do not. Some 
consider margins of victory. And naturally, most are influenced by some form of 
emotional capriciousness. 
</P>
<P>
* Controversy. Hence the word "mythical" often placed before "national 
championship." Although debate is routinely cited as healthy for college 
football, it ceases to be useful when it gets comical. 
</P>
<P>
But no one has concocted a workable format for a playoff system. Moreover, if 
you're trying to eliminate controversy, a two- or four-game format will not get 
it done. Who would be the two teams this year? Miami and Notre Dame? Tell it to 
Florida State. Four teams? Miami, Notre Dame, Florida State and who? Colorado, 
Tennessee, Auburn? And how would the two or four teams be selected? A poll? 
Great. Square one. And even if it could be done, does the world really need 
another Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of a playoff system point to the beauty and symmetry of the NCAA 
basketball tournament and its ability to sort through nearly 300 Division I 
teams and arrive in late March or early April at a national champion. That's 
how you find the best team, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Well, that theory is a mess on two fronts. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, the NCAA Tournament -- as wonderful as it is -- doesn't select 
the best team. It selects the team at the right peak, with the right chemistry, 
for three weeks at the end of the season. If it selected the best team every 
year, neither Kansas nor Seton Hall would have made its most recent Final Four. 
What's more, that's not the tournament's purpose. Its purpose is to provide 
mountains of money for the NCAA and the schools and conferences that 
participate and exposure for TV advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
But as for eliminating ambiguity and controversy? Forget it. It's just a 
different set of problems. As Holtz said, "There is no best team." And no 
perfect system.

LEINSDORF: RARE VISIT BY OUTSPOKEN CONDUCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA PERLMUTTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"There's nothing I need that requires me to polish apples. And it follows that 
I can be as disagreeable as I like, without taking a single risk." 
</P>
<P>
So says Erich Leinsdorf, who never minces his words. The dean of outspoken 
conductors, he tells the truth as he sees and hears it, even to the point of 
admitting that "I look at the world only from my own vantage point." 
</P>
<P>
But that perspective often bears valuable answers to the problems everyone 
grapples with in music. So when Leinsdorf speaks, people listen. 
</P>
<P>
Here to lead the Los Angeles Philharmonic in two programs, the first series 
beginning tonight, he gladly holds forth -- mollified by the balmy weather, 
fussed over by the management at his Beverly Hills hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The venerable maestro who, at 77, has been described as a dour Kapellmeister, 
has spent the last two decades guest-conducting the world's leading orchestras. 
Mightily picky about where he conducts, he touches down in this country at the 
podia of Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
And here to conduct a curious program emphasizing the number 3 with Roy Harris' 
Symphony No. 3, Stravinsky's Symphony in Three Movements, Debussy's "Trois 
Nocturnes" and Three Pieces from Berlioz's "Damnation de Faust," he quips: "I 
didn't consult an astrologist." 
</P>
<P>
Controversy continues to be his calling card. And along the way he issues pithy 
rules of the musical game: 
</P>
<P>
* On programming: "No party pieces, no war horses, no fashion music." 
</P>
<P>
* On his own conducting -- without a baton: "Why use a stick if I can't promise 
a carrot?" 
</P>
<P>
* On others conducting: "If you don't have perfect pitch don't even bother." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent serious issue before him concerns Milton Babbitt's 
"Transfigured Notes," commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra and scheduled 
to have its premiere in 1987 under Leinsdorf. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a pleasant story," he says, narrowing his eyes and looking like a 
wizened imp. "I accepted (the assignment) conditionally; no pig in the poke for 
me. But after studying the score -- maybe it should have been titled 'Verklarte 
Nicht' ("Transfigured Not")," he says with a laugh, in appreciation of his pun 
-- "I knew it could not be done. 
</P>
<P>
"An arrogant pronouncement on my part, right? Well, that's what the peacekeeper 
types in Philadelphia thought. So they next sent the score to Dennis Russell 
Davies, who rehearsed it for a week before the management withdrew it again. 
There was such a brouhaha that Davies lost his entire association with the 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"And this past November they made yet another try, with Hans Vonk, a modern 
music specialist. Failure again. A total of 18 hours to rehearse a 19-minute 
piece. That's 60 times the norm. My assessment, it turns out, was not an 
opinion, but a clearly demonstrable fact." 
</P>
<P>
The symphony orchestra, says Leinsdorf, is tied to tonality. It cannot play the 
diabolically complex music characterized by dodecaphony. Anything beyond 
Debussy, he insists, breeds alienation of players and audiences. 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't blame Babbitt, who, he avows, is "a thoroughly outstanding 
composer of music that takes no account of the public." 
</P>
<P>
So who is the culprit? 
</P>
<P>
"I accuse the commission committees," says Leinsdorf, without a moment's 
hesitation. "They have no excuse. They go to the wrong people. Any person who 
can read a score -- and he is among an endangered species -- will spot one that 
is unplayable by massed choirs of instruments. And yet these are the ones being 
commissioned." 
</P>
<P>
The problem, as he sees it, involves the advent of the composer-in-residence, 
"now a powerful lobby." But the maestro concedes that such commissions have an 
undeniable allure. 
</P>
<P>
It is the symphony orchestra, he suggests, that offers the most publicity, 
recognition and revenue. "One can't fault the recipient of a commission or tell 
him not to take it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Leinsdorf shrinks from leading the revolution. "I'm not the ethics 
committee of music. It's not my place to tell composers that they're barking up 
the wrong tree, even though their alienation of the public is serious." 
</P>
<P>
In the best of all possible worlds, according to the Viennese maestro, 
post-Schoenbergian composers would receive commissions from specialty chamber 
orchestras, ensembles with sensibilities keen enough to perform Babbitt and his 
brethren. 
</P>
<P>
He cites Koussevitzky, 60 years ago at the Boston Symphony, for "knowing what 
composers to tap" -- Stravinsky, Ravel, Gershwin, Prokofiev, Copland -- but 
doesn't account for the fact that such music is not being written today. 
</P>
<P>
Making these pronouncements is par for the Leinsdorf course. It was long ago 
that he gave up being an organization man in order to exercise what he calls 
his First Amendment rights -- the freedom to do and say as he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
As director of the Boston Symphony during the '60s, he received a letter from a 
rabbi in Brookline, "advising me not to conduct Bach's 'St. John' Passion 
because its text was anti-Semitic." 
</P>
<P>
"I knew instantly that this was my signal to leave. Censorship and compromise 
do not work for me. Besides, they take too many victims -- the latest incident 
being the one with Vanessa Redgrave (who sued the Boston Symphony for canceling 
her contract as a narrator). The orchestra manager lost his job over that one." 
</P>
<P>
But Leinsdorf knows how to mind his manners. He demurs when asked what he made 
of the Previn resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't criticize the soup as a dinner guest," he says, referring to the tiff 
between Previn and his (Leinsdorf's) host, Philharmonic executive director 
Ernest Fleischmann, with whom he has buried the hatchet. (They had an 
altercation six years ago when Leinsdorf thought he had been shorted over 
rehearsal time.) 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll issue an equation that holds for orchestras, operas or ballet 
companies: 
</P>
<P>
"There are three players -- the chairman of the board or president, the 
executive or managing director, the artistic director. When two band together 
the third one is out, regardless of reasons. If the situation lasts, it's 
because this has not happened. 
</P>
<P>
"Take it from one who can't help discussing the soup just a little."

MAKING WAVES IN REDONDO; 
</P>
<P>
CONTROVERSY SWIRLS AROUND 'BORN-AGAIN' MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
When Brad Parton was running for mayor of Redondo Beach, he talked about 
gridlock and development. New Age religion, pornography, and beer in city parks 
didn't come up in his campaign pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
So imagine the surprise in this South Bay city when, after his election in 
April, the freshman mayor suddenly launched an attack on vice. Never mind that 
his agenda also included such things as synchronized stoplights and recycling. 
As a result, Parton has stirred more controversy in the last eight months than 
the previous Redondo Beach mayor did in eight years. 
</P>
<P>
In September, Parton said X-rated tabloids should be banned from news racks. 
Then he wanted to halt beer drinking at charity picnics in parks. Then he asked 
the local adult school to cancel a class on "New Age healing" after a voter 
complained that her proposed Bible study course had been disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
A deluge of letters to City Hall has ensued. There have been charges of 
censorship and prohibition. Since Parton's public acknowledgement this fall 
that he is a "born-again" Christian, South Bay newspaper columnists have 
accused the 29-year-old Republican of blurring the line between religion and 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
"People seem to think I'm just some right-wing Christian radical fanatic," 
Parton said, smiling good-naturedly, "and I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
Despite such denials, he has become a local lightning rod for the debate over 
the growing involvement of fundamentalist Christians in local government. 
</P>
<P>
From school boards, where church groups have opposed textbooks they deem 
spiritually inappropriate, to city governments, where they have fought gay 
rights, religious conservatives nationwide are increasingly exerting pressure 
at the grass roots. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hudson, western director of People for the American Way -- a nonprofit 
group that monitors First Amendment issues -- said that at the end of the 
Reagan Administration, national leaders of the religious right launched the 
strategy, reasoning that the lack of a broad, local political base "was the 
reason their moral agenda didn't do better." 
</P>
<P>
In Parton's city, such groups acknowledge that they are promoting church 
involvement in civic affairs. For example, the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, whose 
Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition in November backed several anti-gay 
rights initiatives in the state, said he conducts seminars in the beach cities 
aimed at teaching Christian congregations how to lobby local government. In 
turn, these churches have campaigned vigorously in recent months for everything 
from city land on which to serve the South Bay's homeless to a ban on grade 
school readers they deem satanic and violent. 
</P>
<P>
It is in this context that Parton's critics say he ran on one platform only to 
promote another. 
</P>
<P>
Says Frank Bostrom, an architect whom Parton beat out for the mayoral post: "If 
the people of Redondo Beach had known what his personal agenda would be once he 
got elected, he wouldn't be in office today." 
</P>
<P>
But Parton's supporters say the whole thing has been misunderstood and 
overblown. The mayor, they say, is just a naive young Republican who happens to 
go to church. 
</P>
<P>
Though Parton had been appointed to the Parks and Recreation Commission, and 
had waged an unsuccessful 1988 campaign for a vacant council seat, he never 
held elective office until he became mayor, his advocates note. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get someone in office who's new and unpolitical, they have a tendency 
to do things that get them headlines because they don't know what the limits of 
their office should be," said Tim Carey, executive director of the 
pro-development Southern California Caucus, which backed Parton because of his 
positive stands on business and growth. 
</P>
<P>
Carey said Parton "is a political neophyte who doesn't know how to keep himself 
from being railroaded in an interview." Because he talked to the press about 
his religious views after his election, he ended up being portrayed "as a 
religious zealot out to put crucifixes on every building -- and that's not the 
case," Carey said. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, longtime friends of the mayor say, it is politics he is zealous 
about. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been telling people he wanted to be President since he was a Cub Scout," 
said David Douthit, a businessman who grew up with Parton in Campbell, a 
middle-class suburb of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
In high school, he led a drive to oust a math teacher he felt was leaving him 
and other students unprepared to pass their college-entrance exams. And as a 
business major at San Diego State and president pro-tem of the Associated 
Student Council, Parton wanted to make up for campus-wide budget cuts by 
putting student fees into tutorials instead of recreational programs, friends 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But after graduation, when Parton took a job in Redondo Beach and won a seat on 
the 51st Assembly District Republican Central Committee, his political and 
spiritual lives intertwined. The catalyst, he said, was then-congressional 
candidate Rob Scribner -- a pension planner, former professional football 
player and lay minister at the Lighthouse Four-Square Gospel Church in Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Scribner met Parton at a GOP organizational meeting, and invited him to walk 
precincts for his campaign. Though Scribner subsequently lost to incumbent U.S. 
Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) in 1984 and again in 1986, for Parton, the 
meeting paid off. Scribner helped Parton start his own financial management 
business and took him on as a partner in a series of real estate deals. 
</P>
<P>
Under Scribner's influence, Parton also became a "born-again" Christian in 
1987, an event that he said profoundly affected his political life. 
</P>
<P>
Parton said it confounds him that he has image problems. When he proposed the 
ban on beer in city parks, for example, his intention was to enforce an 
existing ordinance that had been undercut as the City Council issued one 
exemption after another to charities that wanted to sell beer at fund-raisers, 
he explained.

ALAN HALE JR., 68; SKIPPER ON TV'S 'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alan Hale Jr., a veteran character actor best remembered as the blundering but 
likable skipper of a charter boat that for three television seasons during the 
1960s was shipwrecked on "Gilligan's Island," has died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Hale, who was 68, had been undergoing treatment for cancer of the thymus for 
about a year before he died Tuesday evening at St. Vincent Medical Center, his 
wife, Naomi, said. 
</P>
<P>
The actor had been admitted to the medical center about four weeks ago and was 
undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatments, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
The thymus is a gland-like structure that helps in the body's immune function, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"During the last two weeks, it became quite painful for him," Mrs. Hale said. 
"He fought very hard until he died. His mind was very clear, it was just that 
his body couldn't fight back any more." 
</P>
<P>
The son of silent screen stars Gretchen Hartman and Alan Hale Sr., Hale Jr. was 
born in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Portly and gregarious, the 6-foot, 2-inch Hale was often mistaken for his 
father, a successful character actor who had roles in more than 100 feature 
films. The father's career included appearances as Little John both in the 1922 
silent screen version of "Robin Hood" with Douglas Fairbanks Sr. as Robin and 
the same role opposite Errol Flynn in a 1938 sound remake of that epic 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Hale Jr. played supporting roles in more than 70 films, beginning as a youth in 
1933 with "Wild Boys of the Road." Before "Gilligan's Island," which ran from 
1964 to 1967, he appeared in two other television series -- "Casey Jones" and 
"Biff Baker, U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
But it was the ill-fated "three-hour tour" on the SS Minnow that launched 
Hale's most notable character. In the plot, the tour was waylaid by a storm and 
the Minnow swept away to an uncharted South Pacific Island. 
</P>
<P>
For three full seasons of television production and now nearly three decades of 
syndicated reruns, Hale's bellowing belly laughs created a lasting impression 
on two generations of TV viewers. 
</P>
<P>
Since the original series ended, the cast has been reunited for three TV movie 
reunions in 1978, '79 and '81. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Denver, who played the title role on "Gilligan's Island," said he and Hale 
performed together four times last year at promotional appearances. 
</P>
<P>
Denver remembered Hale as the lovable, strong man who served as a safety net 
for the cast's pratfalls. 
</P>
<P>
"He broke his wrist once and didn't tell anyone on the set until a year later 
because he didn't want to shut down production," Denver said. "Doing physical 
comedy with some one that secure was great." 
</P>
<P>
After the series, Hale continued to act in movies and on television. His most 
recent appearances include cameos on "Alf," "Growing Pains," "Murder She Wrote" 
and "The New Gidget," said his agent, Steve Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
"We were going along like he was going to beat this," Stevens said of his 
friend's death. "Then, about five weeks ago, he called and told me he was a 
very sick man. That was the first time he ever made any kind of statement like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'70s, Hale became co-owner of Alan Hale's Lobster Barrel on La 
Cienega Boulevard on Los Angeles' Restaurant Row. Hale helped run the business 
until 1982, when he was "phased out" of the operation, Stevens said. The actor 
then opened Alan Hale's Quality and Leisure Travel office, where, among other 
things, he arranged for travelers to take boat cruises. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody ever saw any change in Alan," Stevens said. "He was such a big man and 
his energy was always up. Many who were very close to him didn't know he was 
sick until the end. He was not the kind of man who wanted anyone to make a fuss 
over him." 
</P>
<P>
Hale's body will be cremated and the ashes scattered at sea. In lieu of 
flowers, the family requested that donations be made to the Oncological Society 
at St. Vincent Medical Center.
