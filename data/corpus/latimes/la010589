Soviet envoy Yuli M. Vorontsov arrived in Pakistan for a visit expected to 
include talks with Afghan guerrilla leaders. Vorontsov indicated that Moscow's 
troop withdrawal from Afghanistan will proceed on schedule if there are no 
further rebel attacks. Under accords signed last April in Geneva, all Soviet 
troops are to be withdrawn by Feb. 15. Vorontsov, one of Moscow's top 
diplomatic trouble-shooters, arrived in Islamabad from Tehran, where he spoke 
with Iranian-based Afghan resistance leaders.

Britain on Wednesday backed American charges that Libya was building a chemical 
weapons plant near Tripoli and said London has received independent information 
to prove the allegations.

<P>
The British government also said it accepted the U.S. position that two 
warplanes that shot down two Libyan jet fighters on Wednesday had acted in 
self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The United States said the air clash was not linked to rising U.S.-Libyan 
tension over the alleged weapons plant, which Libya says is a pharmaceuticals 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been in contact with a number of countries to make the point that we 
have independent information on the Libyan chemical weapons program," a Foreign 
Office spokesman said in the first British comment on the controversial plant. 
</P>
<P>
"This information shows that the plant is very large and that there can be no 
doubt it is intended for chemical weapons production," he added.

<TEXT>

Harold W. Zancanata, 70, a scientist and pioneer in the U.S. space program who 
developed some of the first booster rockets for testing the atmosphere. For 
more than 30 years, Zancanata developed rockets and launched them from sites in 
several states, including Cape Canaveral in Florida and White Sands Missile 
Range in New Mexico. "He was the project officer responsible for instrumenting 
rockets used to study the physics and chemistry of the upper atmosphere," said 
William Dean, a retired Army mathematician who worked closely with Zancanata. 
In 1952, Zancanata combined a German V-2 rocket captured during World War II 
with a U.S. Corporal rocket and fired the missile 250 miles, a record at the 
time, said his son, Rodney. Zancanata and a team of scientists launched rockets 
in the early 1960s from Christmas and Johnson islands in the Pacific Ocean to 
study the effects of nuclear blasts on the atmosphere. In Fort Lauderdale,

AIR POLLUTION LEVELS INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN S.D. COUNTY IN 1988 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego County skies were slightly smoggier in 1988, prompting air pollution 
control authorities to call for two Stage One smog alerts and record 45 other 
days when ozone levels exceeded minimum federal standards. 
</P>
<P>
Those statistics, released Wednesday, are up from one smog alert and 40 days of 
excess ozone levels recorded in 1987 by the county's Air Pollution Control 
District. 
</P>
<P>
But the increase is no cause to worry, said R. J. Sommerville, the county's air 
pollution control officer. It was attributed to the extremely hot weather, 
which plagued all of the country and prompted smog problems everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year was one of the hottest years in the United States and there were 
widely publicized accounts of elevated pollution and smog levels throughout the 
United States, including places like New York, which does not normally have the 
levels that were experienced last year," said Sommerville. 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville added that even with the slight increase, the 1988 smog statistics 
are in keeping with a 10-year trend toward cleaner air in San Diego County. In 
1978, there were 90 days of excess smog and 11 smog alerts, statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
Smog -- the bane of Southern California -- is produced by a photochemical 
reaction in the atmosphere between sunlight and hydrocarbon emissions and 
oxides of nitrogen. In San Diego, about 80% of the oxides of nitrogen and half 
of the hydrocarbons come from motor vehicle emissions. 
</P>
<P>
The federal minimum health standard for smog is 12 parts per hundred million 
(p.p.h.m.) for one hour. Anything over that is, in air pollution parlance, 
called an "exceedance" and affects the lungs of normal individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Smog detected at 20 p.p.h.m. or greater triggers a Stage One Alert, during 
which the elderly, children and people with respiratory and cardiac problems 
are advised to limit their physical activity. A Stage Two Alert is called when 
smog exceeds 35 p.p.h.m.. 
</P>
<P>
No Stage Two Alerts were called in San Diego County during 1988, but one was 
called in the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which includes Los 
Angeles, Orange, and parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-Orange County air basin also registered 76 Stage One alerts and 
172 other days when the ozone exceeded the federal minimum levels. 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville said Wednesday that most of the smoggy days in San Diego County are 
caused by the bad air drifting south from the Los Angeles-Orange County 
</P>
<P>
basin. Although the analysis for 1988 is incomplete, previous studies have 
shown that 25 to 30 smoggy days a year in San Diego are caused by the 
"transported" ozone from the north, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville said automobile smog controls are to thank for the trend toward 
cleaner air in San Diego during the last decade. But by the mid-1990s, the 
trend could be reversed by urban growth, which will send a glut of cars 
streaming onto local highways and roads, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have more people owning more cars, driving them longer distances and more 
frequently," Sommerville said. "Our highways are getting congested and all that 
implies more smog." 
</P>
<P>
To compensate for the growth, Sommerville said air pollution officials are 
trying to devise ways to control auto use -- especially for commuters -- to 
minimize smog. Answers may include flex hours and van and car pooling. 
</P>
<P>
Sommerville also said that the air pollution district will also turn its 
attention to other sources of ozone, such as household cleaning products, 
aerosol sprays and stick deodorants. 
</P>
<P>
"Many people don't know that the deodorants they are using are made out of 
materials that evaporate into the atmosphere," said Sommerville. Other 
contributors to ozone include bathroom cleaners and solvents, such as chemicals 
used to remove spots from rugs, he said.

SUPERVISORS OPPOSE PLAN TO BLOCK LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors has voted to strongly oppose a pending city of Los 
Angeles development plan that would block the use of three Westside canyons as 
a regional landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The board, on a 3-1 vote, directed its staff to argue at City Council hearings 
against a provision in the proposed Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan 
that prohibits development of Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons for garbage 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, three of the five supervisors -- Deane Dana, Mike Antonovich and Ed 
Edelman -- said they either opposed a landfill in the canyons or that they 
would consider it only as a last resort to solve long-range garbage disposal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
But the supervisors reportedly want to keep the possibility of using the 
canyons as a landfill alive as a bargaining chip with the city. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon area is one of six locations that sanitation experts say are 
technically best suited to be garbage dumps. Four of the others are on the 
northern rim of the San Fernando Valley or near Santa Clarita. The fifth is in 
Griffith Park.

BEVERLY HILLS TENTATIVELY OKS SCALED-DOWN SMOKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two years after it passed one of the toughest smoking ordinances in the 
nation, the Beverly Hills City Council has heeded restaurateurs' protests and 
adopted a substantially scaled-down law that exempts existing restaurants from 
strict ventilation requirements and allows smoking in 40% of dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised ordinance, which requires a second reading before becoming 
law, only restaurants that open after Jan. 1 must install the ventilation 
systems. In addition, new restaurants can avoid the systems if they install 
walls separating smoking and nonsmoking areas and if the sections have separate 
air sources. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance does not affect bars, lounges, private banquet rooms or 
restaurants in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law, which was unanimously passed Tuesday, represents a victory 
for restaurant owners who complained that the ventilation systems were 
expensive and cumbersome. The old law requiring the systems was passed in July, 
1987, after restaurant owners protested a highly publicized ban on all smoking 
in restaurants with more than 50 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Bilofsky, president of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, said he is 
disappointed that existing restaurants will not be required to install 
ventilation systems, but he added that he is pleased that the minimum space for 
nonsmoking sections was increased from 50% to 60% of dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, a complete prohibition on smoking would have been the best thing 
for nonsmokers," Bilofsky said, "but all the parties have approached the 
negotiations over this 60% separation in a constructive spirit. Of all the 
situations where cities and counties in California have enacted smoking laws, 
restaurants have been the most difficult because restaurants want to 
accommodate smoking customers. People like to smoke after dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Spivak, president of the Beverly Hills Restaurant Assn., said the 
ventilation systems would have cost between $7,000 and $25,000 to install. The 
city issued ventilation standards in September, 1987, that would have required 
"air curtains" to keep smoke from entering nonsmoking sections in large 
restaurants that did not have walls separating smoking and nonsmoking areas. 
</P>
<P>
Approved ventilation systems were to have been completed and working by June 
15, 1988, but none were installed because the restaurant group persuaded the 
City Council to grant a series of extensions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a very fair and equitable (ordinance) and it's been a long 
time in coming, but I think it's workable," Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds said.

AMERICA AS VIGILANTE

Reagan Administration officials were quick to deny any link between Wednesday's 
shoot-down of two Libyan jet fighters by Navy planes over the Mediterranean and 
Washington's rising concerns about an alleged chemical-warfare factory in the 
Libyan desert. That disavowal is unpersuasive. When the President of the United 
States publicly hints, as he did last week, that an American attack on the 
Libyan plant can't be ruled out, then the stage is set for the kind of 
encounter that has now taken place. We don't know whether the clash between 
Navy F-14s and Libyan MIG-23s was provoked or simply the product of nervous 
reaction. But to try to pass it off as no more than coincidental to the 
week-long political maneuvering that preceded it seems absurd. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials are probably right in suggesting that the incident is now closed 
and unlikely in itself to produce either further confrontation or major 
political consequences. Still left unresolved, however, is the matter of the 
goings-on at what everyone agrees is some kind of chemical complex 40 miles 
south of Tripoli. The Reagan Administration says that the site is meant to 
produce chemical weapons, including mustard gas. Col. Moammar Kadafi, the 
Libyan dictator, says that the enterprise is dedicated to nothing more sinister 
than the production of pharmaceuticals. The prospect that chemical weapons 
might soon pass into the hands of a fanatic supporter of international 
terrorists is chilling. But is a prospect reason enough to threaten what by any 
reasonable legal standard could only be interpreted as an act of aggression? 
</P>
<P>
The United States charges that a number of its allies, West Germany most 
prominently, have sold Libya materials or otherwise helped it to acquire a 
chemical-warfare capacity. Probably -- although not certainly -- the U.S. 
threat to blow up the Libyan plant is intended foremost to pressure allied 
governments into preventing further transfers of such materials or technology. 
Lobbying to control the proliferation of chemical weapons is both legitimate 
and responsible. But threatening to attack a country on the basis of evidence 
that this country's friends say they so far find less than persuasive is 
neither. 
</P>
<P>
A 1925 international agreement bans the use of chemical weapons. The Iran-Iraq 
War showed not only that this agreement can be ignored but also that its 
violations will go unpunished. This weekend a conference is due to open in 
Paris aimed at finding new ways to enforce a chemical-weapons ban. What has to 
be recognized for now, though, is that there is nothing in international law 
that forbids either the possession or the manufacture of chemical weapons. 
Libya, in short, is not committing outlawry by seeking to join a score of other 
states in acquiring chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The United States should of course spare no diplomatic and political efforts to 
try to isolate Libya from suppliers of chemical-warfare materials. But the 
United States is not the world's policeman, or even the Mediterranean's. Least 
of all, as an exponent of the rule and force of law, can it afford to be 
perceived as the world's vigilante, ready to use its armed forces to try to do 
what its diplomacy has been unable to. Is Libya building chemical weapons? If 
so, let the United States present its evidence publicly and clearly. Do that, 
and it seems certain that those helping Libya will have no choice but to halt 
their dangerous and odious commerce.

THIRD WORLD POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I want to congratulate Bruce for his excellent column. I want to add that Third 
World countries are not the only ones to blame for the present world-debt 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Banks can only make money by loaning money. After a long influx of 
petro-dollars after OPEC's success in raising oil prices, banks had to lend 
these newly deposited funds out to make money on them. Since "countries do not 
cede to exist" (former Citibank bank official), countries were considered an 
excellent credit risk. When banks loan out money for commercial purposes, this 
money is generally used for production equipment that can generate income in 
the future. Banks are very particular when loaning money to companies. They 
weren't that particular with countries though. Funds were used for prestige 
projects, military spending (that does not create future income), Mercedes cars 
for families of influence and bribes, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
Now the International Monetary Fund is forcing the poorest people in these 
countries, the people who reaped little benefit from the loans to begin with, 
to pay back the debt of their previous rulers. They are expected to reduce 
imports of medical supplies to preserve foreign reserve in spite of their 
already dismal health situation. They are expected to substitute their present 
food crops like grain with export crops like soybeans to feed cattle in Europe 
and America. And this when 40,000 children die each day of hunger and 
hunger-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce gives some excellent suggestions on alternate courses of action. So does 
the Global Poverty Reduction Act, presently pending before Congress.

THIRD WORLD POVERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three recent articles concern Third World debt, and that concerns me. Countries 
deep in debt like Brazil, Haiti, Mexico, Liberia, and Nigeria have cut back on 
social programs in their unsuccessful attempts to make payments. Who suffers 
most -- always, the children. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 10 years ago UNICEF declared that the '80s would be the Decade of the 
Children. Since then half of the world's children have been immunized and a 
quarter of their parents know how to deal with health threats like dehydration 
and births that come too close together. Still, 14 million kids die needlessly 
each year from chronic undernutrition and preventable diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Economic strategists are proposing feasible solutions to the debt crisis. We 
can work from our end, the United States, in two ways. The President has the 
authority to forgive debt altogether or to allow repayment in local currencies. 
We must urge him to use his authority. This month Congress will reintroduce the 
Global Poverty Reduction Act that mandates real aid for real development. That 
legislation will ensure that money reaches the poorest of the poor by using 
social goals to track progress. One of the three measures would be the 
under-5-years-of-age mortality rate. We must "lobby" our representatives to 
pass this bill.

INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lincoln Kaplan has it all wrong when he states that Supreme Court Justices 
William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun are the most sensitive to 
"individual rights" (Opinion, Dec. 18). He is correct in saying these justices 
care more about the individual criminal's rights than individual victim's 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
They don't care much about the individual's rights to a drug-free school or 
neighborhood. If said justices will drop their invented and contorted 
constitutional interpretations defending the rights to drugs and crime, then 
inner-city residents can really get on with the job of reclaiming their 
neighborhoods from the criminals.

GRAYMAIL, SECRETS AND THE NORTH TRIAL; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ON CLASSIFIED DATA MAKES VAST DIFFICULTY FOR ALL PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP A. LACOVARA, Philip A. Lacovara served as deputy solicitor general of 
the United States and as counsel to the Watergate special prosecutor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The charges swirl around the blond-paneled courtroom in Washington where the 
Iran-Contra case is being readied for a jury. Is the independent counsel 
unfairly trying to prevent Lt. Col. Oliver L. North from showing that he is the 
"white hat" hero of the Iran-Contra affair and many other clandestine 
intelligence missions? Or, instead, is North trying to "graymail" his country 
by threatening to expose the nation's deepest secrets if he is forced to trial? 
</P>
<P>
The posturing on both sides tends more to obscure the underlying issues than to 
illuminate them. The judge himself has, until quite recently, seemed baffled, 
if not befuddled, in deciding which side to believe. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the dispute, it is important to recognize that both sides are 
playing for high stakes. (Witness, for example, North taking the extraordinary 
step of subpoenaing the President, the President-elect, the secretary of state 
and other high officials to testify on his behalf.) The independent counsel, 
former federal Judge Lawrence E. Walsh, is seeking to persuade a jury that 
North is a felon who conspired to "defraud" the United States by depriving the 
public of its right to have government officers and agencies perform their 
duties properly. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor charges that, by arranging the secret sale of arms to Iran and 
then even more secretly using the profits to finance the Nicaraguan Contras, 
North was perverting the governmental process, misusing government assets and 
frustrating Congress' desire -- however clumsily expressed -- to distance our 
government from the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
In response, North contends that his role in orchestrating this international 
arbitrage fell well within the scope of the vital and shadowy missions that he 
had regularly been entrusted to perform with approval at the "highest levels" 
of government. He was commissioned, he contends, to exercise the kind of 
bravado and ingenuity that the staid bureaucrats in the more traditional 
intelligence services could not duplicate. 
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, North wants to lay before the jury highly classified 
documents -- about 30,000 pages worth -- that he claims would show the range of 
authorized (or implicitly sanctioned) anti-terrorist missions that he 
conducted. These records also would illustrate his regular -- and approved -- 
practice of using unorthodox and "off-the-books" ventures (like Swiss bank 
accounts and dummy corporations) to keep the nation's enemies in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
As the trial judge recognized early in the case, North and other potential 
witnesses "operated from secure locations in the White House with full access 
to the most sensitive information and most critical national-security 
intelligence methods and sources available to the government." 
</P>
<P>
The crunch comes because the intelligence agencies want a tight lid clamped 
onto this information. They also want to suppress the super-secret information 
that North carries around in his head and has pledged -- or threatened -- to 
disclose if he is forced to exonerate his conduct at a trial. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is not new, even though the Iran-Contra case portrays it on a 
grander scale. For many years a bizarre paradox confronted prosecutors, spies 
and renegades in the national-security apparatus -- the more sensitive and 
important the crime, the less likely it would ever be prosecuted. In our 
system, not only is the accused entitled to an open public trial, but even 
members of the press and ordinary citizens can demand the right to sit in the 
spectators' gallery as the evidence unfolds. Thus the prosecution must prove 
its case with evidence placed on the public record. The accused in turn is 
entitled to bring out all facts that may explain his actions or mitigate his 
culpability. 
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon became known as "graymail" -- the prospect that the stakes 
might be raised too high if the government proceeded with a prosecution 
relating to national security because a public trial would inevitably disclose 
even more secret information. Offenses involving national security thus 
acquired a kind of practical immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, however, Congress tried to fashion a compromise that would respect the 
legitimate interests of prosecution and defense while protecting the public 
interest in allowing courts and juries to resolve criminal charges involving 
security-related activities. That statute, the Classified Information 
Procedures Act, imposes limits on a defendant's ability to discover classified 
information in the government's files. The statute also regulates the process 
for using classified documents or testimony at trial. 
</P>
<P>
The basic premise of the statute is that a federal trial judge, using flexible 
and creative alternatives, can help forge substitutes for detailed classified 
information that will leave the defendant in substantially the same position as 
if the classified details themselves had emerged. Thus, when the government 
responds to pretrial demands for classified documents, the judge may permit the 
government "to substitute a summary of the information for such classified 
documents, or to substitute a statement admitting relevant facts that the 
classified information would tend to prove." 
</P>
<P>
More sticky is the control of information already in the defendant's possession 
-- including documents not only in his possession but also information in his 
head -- as well as the testimony of witnesses. The statute addresses these 
concerns by imposing on the defendant the obligation to give advance warning to 
the government and the court if he "reasonably expects to disclose or to cause 
the disclosure of classified information in any manner in connection with any 
trial or pretrial proceeding." 
</P>
<P>
If the judge concludes that the information is relevant and permits either 
pretrial discovery or potential disclosure at trial, the government then can 
invoke the judge's power to approve substitutions for the "specific classified 
information." The alternatives include a statement in which the government 
admits the relevant facts that the information would tend to prove, or submits 
a summary of the classified information. The test to be applied is whether "the 
statement or summary will provide the defendant with substantially the same 
ability to make his defense as would disclosure of the specific classified 
information." 
</P>
<P>
For example, if the accused seeks to defend his conduct by claiming that he was 
acting to protect highly classified nuclear targeting plans, the judge might 
simply require the prosecution to acknowledge before the jury that there are 
such plans without publicly disclosing the actual classified target assignments 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The statute has real teeth. It forbids a defendant to disclose any information 
"known or believed to be classified" in connection with his prosecution until 
he has given the required notice and afforded the government the opportunity to 
challenge his plans or at least to persuade the court to allow unclassified 
substitutions for the information said to be relevant to the defense. If the 
defendant fails to honor this obligation, the statute authorizes the judge to 
"preclude disclosure" of any classified information not covered by the 
screening procedures and to "prohibit the examination by the defendant of any 
witness with respect to such information." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980 the government has used the statute successfully in espionage and 
counterintelligence cases. The process that it requires, however, can be 
time-consuming and cumbersome. It was not really designed for a case in which, 
as in Iran-Contra, the prosecution concedes that perhaps 30,000 pages of 
classified data may be relevant to the charges but insists that they cannot be 
used in their raw form in a public trial. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, defendants including North vigorously challenge the 
constitutionality of the process itself. As North argues -- and the 
constitutional issues remain open -- these procedural requirements raise 
difficult questions under the Fifth Amendment (self-incrimination) and the 
Sixth Amendment (effective assistance of counsel). By requiring the defense to 
make pretrial disclosures of the information that may be used at the trial, 
including the testimony of defense witnesses and perhaps even of the defendant 
himself, the statute also implicates the due-process clause. That clause 
generally limits the government's power to force the accused to lay bare 
defense claims in advance of trial, at least where the prosecution does not 
assume a reciprocal burden of full disclosure before trial.

BUSH HAS COMPELLING REASONS TO PURSUE CHEMICAL-WEAPONS PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELISA D. HARRIS, Elisa D. Harris, a guest scholar at the Brookings 
Institution in Washington, is a Social Science Research Council-MacArthur 
Foundation fellow in international peace and security studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On numerous occasions throughout last year's presidential campaign, Vice 
President George Bush promised voters that a treaty banning chemical weapons 
would be one of the highest priorities of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
This intention to work actively on behalf of a chemical-weapons ban has become 
a source of concern to arms-control opponents and proponents alike. The former 
question the "verifiability" of a chemical-weapons treaty while the latter fear 
that it may take precedence over a treaty limiting strategic nuclear arms. 
Although it will not be easy to reach final agreement on the terms under which 
all chemical weapons can be eliminated, domestic as well as international 
realities make it imperative that such a treaty be at the top of the Bush 
Administration's arms-control agenda. 
</P>
<P>
The President-elect's personal interest in banning chemical weapons is partly 
explained by his own recent involvement with the issue. In April, 1984, Bush 
introduced a chemical-weapons treaty draft in Geneva on behalf of the United 
States. This is probably one of the few Reagan Administration foreign-policy 
efforts that bears the vice president's fingerprints. Bush also cast three 
tie-breaking votes in the Senate in favor of the Pentagon's program to produce 
new chemical weapons. Because his first vote in support of the so-called 
binary-weapons program prompted a disapproving phone call from the vice 
president's mother, Dorothy Bush, President Reagan himself agreed to call the 
elder Bush to explain her son's second vote. A successful outcome in Geneva 
therefore would not only be a personal triumph for the President-elect but 
would also vindicate his earlier votes on binary weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Over and above these personal reasons, domestic and international problems 
provide other, more compelling, reasons to pursue a ban on chemical weapons. 
Here at home, Congress is showing more and more reluctance to continue funding 
the binary-weapons program. Doubts about the technical effectiveness of one of 
the proposed systems, the Bigeye bomb, as well as more general budgetary 
restraints resulted in deep cuts in the binary program in the current fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
If, as seems likely, these technical and budgetary concerns remain, Congress 
will almost certainly impose further limits on the production of binary 
artillery shells, and will refuse to provide additional funds for the 
development and procurement of other binary systems. Under these circumstances, 
even the most ardent binary enthusiasts are likely to support the elimination 
of both American and Soviet chemical-weapons stocks as part of a larger treaty 
on chemical disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
Two international developments add further urgency to the efforts to ban 
chemical weapons. Under an agreement reached by Reagan and Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl in May, 1986, U.S. chemical weapons currently stored in West Germany are 
to be removed by 1992. This agreement enjoys widespread support in West 
Germany, in part because civilians there would suffer disproportionately if 
such weapons were ever used in a Central European war. 
</P>
<P>
However, influential elements in both Congress and the Pentagon believe that 
without the U.S. stocks of chemical weapons in West Germany the Atlantic 
alliance will be severely weakened in its ability to deter Soviet chemical use. 
As the 1992 deadline draws nearer, the United States may be forced to choose 
between trying to delay or prevent implementation of the Reagan-Kohl agreement, 
thus precipitating a crisis in U.S.-West German relations, and carrying out an 
act of unilateral chemical disarmament. Only by agreeing to eliminate all 
chemical weapons will the United States be able to avoid this Hobbesian choice. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, and most important, a ban on chemical weapons is essential to halting 
their proliferation in the developing world. For many years the only known 
members of the chemical club were the United States, the Soviet Union and 
France. This situation changed abruptly in 1984, when U.N. investigators 
confirmed Iranian claims of Iraqi chemical use in the Persian Gulf war. As many 
as a dozen other Third World countries, including Libya, reportedly either 
possess chemical weapons or are trying to acquire them. Persuading these 
countries to forgo what has often been termed the "poor man's atomic bomb" will 
not be easy. Yet without a global chemical-weapons ban the proliferation of 
these weapons will almost certainly continue. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. security as well as international security more generally would be well 
served by an agreement eliminating chemical weapons on a global scale. Bush 
recognizes this simple fact, and has committed himself to achieving this goal. 
No one need fear that he will sign a "bad" chemical-weapons treaty. Nor should 
there be concern about such a treaty detracting from efforts to reduce 
strategic nuclear arms. The real worry is that efforts to achieve a ban on 
chemical weapons will be impeded by those who fail to understand the domestic 
and international realities that the next President will face.

KADAFI'S ACTIONS MAKE LIBYA AN EASY BUT NECESSARY TARGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY RUBIN, Barry Rubin, a senior research fellow at the Washington 
Institute for Near East Policy, is the author of the forthcoming Istanbul 
Intrigues (McGraw-Hill). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Col. Moammar Kadafi's combination of outdated ideology and state-of-the-art 
weaponry makes him a threat to America's interests and Libya's neighbors. The 
latest U.S.-Libyan clash -- in which American F-14s shot down two Libyan 
MIG-23s over the Mediterranean -- is another periodic and necessary reminder 
for him to curb his ambitions and trouble-making. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Defense Department, the aerial battle took place during 
routine U.S. maneuvers when the Libyan planes threatened the American patrol 
over international waters. Although the incident occurred 600 miles away from 
its new chemical-weapons factory, the Libyan action was no doubt related to a 
fear that the United States would soon attack the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since he took power in September, 1969, just before his 30th birthday, 
Kadafi has persisted in his megalomaniacal ambition to be the leader of the 
Arab world. His hero is the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdul Nasser, whose 
efforts to unite the Arabs and destroy Israel led to so much tragedy throughout 
the Middle East. Kadafi's imitation would be farcical if not for the bloody 
trail left by Libyan-backed terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi has repeatedly failed in his attempts to undermine or take over other 
states. Neighboring Chad, with French assistance, beat back his invasion after 
several years. His blatant and bullying interference in other parts of Africa 
has made him an unpopular figure, particularly when his promises of aid were 
never fulfilled. Kadafi has no real allies in the Arab world. Money and arms 
have been supplied to terrorist and guerrilla groups ranging from the Irish 
Republican Army to the Muslim nationalists of the southern Philippines, without 
any appreciable gains for either Libya or its clients. If one considers only 
Kadafi's lack of political victories or strategic gains, he is not a threat to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Kadafi's activities do pose a serious threat because of his responsibility 
for terrorist deeds that kill or wound people, including Americans, and 
destabilize other states. In the areas of terrorism, the proliferation of 
chemical weapons and the Arab-Israeli conflict, Kadafi does jeopardize vital 
U.S. interests: 
</P>
<P>
Terrorism. Along with Syria and Iran, Libya is the leading sponsor of state 
terrorism. It has supplied training sites, false documents, safe haven, 
weapons, money and transport for a wide variety of terrorists. During the last 
two decades dozens of murderous attacks would never have taken place if not for 
Libyan assistance and, in some cases, direction. The Libyan government tried to 
assassinate exiled dissidents, even on American soil. The United States tried 
to deter Kadafi by commercial embargoes, and pressured its allies to follow 
suit. Nothing worked. 
</P>
<P>
After a particularly blatant terrorist attack on a club frequented by Americans 
in West Berlin, the United States intercepted radio communications proving 
Libyan involvement. In May, 1986, the United States retaliated with a bombing 
raid on Libya. The results were dramatic: A badly shaken Kadafi virtually 
ceased all his terrorist efforts. 
</P>
<P>
This lasted about two years. But there were increasing reports that Kadafi 
wanted to renew his activities, using terrorists from the Japanese Red Army -- 
a group that would be harder to trace back to Libya. 
</P>
<P>
The reinitiation of Libyan-backed terrorism was timed to coincide with the 
second anniversary of the raid on Tripoli. Last April the Japanese terrorists, 
probably acting in concert with Lebanese colleagues, attacked a USO club in 
Naples. Five people, including an American servicewoman, were killed. About the 
same time, a Red Army terrorist, Yu Kikomura, was arrested on the New Jersey 
Turnpike, apparently en route to bomb a U.S. target. 
</P>
<P>
Libya has also been mentioned in connection with the bombing last month of Pan 
Am Flight 103 over Scotland. If there is firm evidence of Kadafi's involvement 
in this crime, the United States would seriously consider retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Chemical warfare. A more immediate issue is the news that Libya has 
constructed, with the assistance of West German companies, a factory capable of 
making chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Kadafi denied this accusation, claiming that the plant makes only medicine. But 
his hollow alibi underestimates the effectivness of American intelligence, 
including satellite surveillance of the installation. Iraq's blatant use of 
chemical weapons against Iranian soldiers and Kurdish civilians has dangerously 
lowered the threshold for employing such weapons. Kadafi is scarcely a 
responsible leader -- he has long sought nuclear weapons, and the Egyptians 
have accused him of once planning to sink the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II -- 
and the prospect of his having mustard gas or nerve gas is quite chilling. 
</P>
<P>
While protesting his innocence, Kadafi announced the building of a "defense 
system" around the factory to protect it from "American terrorism" that, he 
says, is aimed at destroying all Arab civilian industrial capacity. Obviously 
fearful of another U.S. attack, he dubbed President Reagan a "stupid child" and 
an "insane and mad dog." While the Libyan leader offered to allow international 
inspection of the plant, U.S. intelligence sources reported that the Libyans 
were moving the chemicals used in preparing poison gas so that the plant would 
appear to be "clean." This nervousness may persuade Kadafi to back down to 
diplomatic pressure. The United States is also trying to mobilize international 
forces, at a conference on chemical weapons taking place this weekend in Paris, 
for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab-Israeli conflict. Kadafi is one of Israel's most stubborn and ruthless 
foes, and is trying to torpedo any progress on negotiations to resolve the 
Middle East conflict. He has opposed Palestine Liberation Organization leader 
Yasser Arafat's tentative moves toward moderation. 
</P>
<P>
It can well be argued that Libya is an easy target for American military power. 
It is weaker than Syria or Iran, and it lacks the degree of Soviet and Arab 
support enjoyed by Damascus. But Libya should be aware of that fact, and this 
very vulnerability should make it more cautious. Since Kadafi refuses to act in 
even a marginally responsible manner, the United States will have to keep up 
the pressure to force him either to compromise peacefully or to back down in 
the face of force.

DRUNK DRIVER WHO HURT 3 GETS 3-YEAR PRISON TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A North Hollywood man who drove drunk and hit three pedestrians, severely 
injuring two of them, was sentenced to 3 years in prison Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Gustavo Quintanilla, 30, pleaded no contest last month to felony drunk 
driving in the Dec. 1 crash. After hitting the three men, Quintanilla fled, 
leaving his two young children behind, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three victims had a foot amputated after the crash, and another is 
in danger of losing the lower part of both legs, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lloyd 
M. Nash. 
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt, it's one of the worst driving-under-the-influence injury 
cases that I have seen," Nash said. "It's not the same as somebody being 
killed, but it's a bad case." 
</P>
<P>
A blood sample taken from Quintanilla half an hour after the accident showed 
his blood-alcohol level at 0.29%, nearly three times the state's 0.10% legal 
standard for drunkenness, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Prior Convictions 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber said he sentenced Quintanilla to 3 
years -- 1 year less than the maximum -- because Quintanilla had no prior 
drunk-driving convictions and entered his plea shortly after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Quintanilla's pickup, which was traveling east on Vanowen Street in Van Nuys, 
struck at least two parked cars and then jumped a curb, pinning three men 
against a concrete wall, Nash said. Quintanilla's two young sons were 
passengers in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Sanchez, 21, of Pacoima lost his right foot in the accident. Jose 
Galvez, 27, of Sherman Oaks suffered two broken legs and is in danger of losing 
the lower parts of each, Nash said. Sergio Ramirez, 18, of Van Nuys is 
recovering from two broken legs, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Quintanilla and his 4-year-old son were not hurt, but his 7-year-old son 
bruised his head, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Held for Police 
</P>
<P>
Quintanilla, who left his children in the pickup, fled on foot, but two men who 
had seen the accident from a nearby apartment building caught him about two 
blocks away and held him for police, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
Quintanilla said he had been drinking at his home and at a friend's house 
before the crash, according to a Los Angeles County probation officer's report. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I fell asleep at the wheel," Quintanilla was quoted as saying. "I feel 
bad about this. I certainly did not intend to hurt anyone." 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for Quintanilla's no-contest plea, prosecutors agreed to drop two 
other felony charges of drunk driving and hit-and-run driving, both related to 
the crash. If he is a model prisoner, Quintanilla will be eligible for parole 
in 18 months, Nash said.

INGLEWOOD CITY MANAGER VOTED LUCRATIVE NEW PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Inglewood City Council has granted veteran City Manager Paul Eckles a 
3-year contract extension giving him a significant salary increase and an 
improved severance pay package should his duties be diminished by council 
ordinance or City Charter amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Daniel Tabor cast the only opposing vote at Tuesday's council 
meeting, saying the council should have negotiated with Eckles after he 
submitted the contract proposal. If the contract were invoked today, it would 
provide him with more than six months of severance pay and compensation for 
unused sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
The contract provisions and Tabor's dissent reflect political uncertainty at 
Inglewood City Hall. An election for three council seats is scheduled this 
year, and voting for a fourth is possible depending on the outcome of a court 
fight. Also, Tabor recently called for the creation of council committees to 
help manage the city and increase the power of a predominantly black council 
over a largely white city administration. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, Tabor praised Eckles and insisted that there was no racial 
factor in his vote against the contract. 
</P>
<P>
A 2-hour executive session preceded the vote to extend the contract, which 
makes Eckles one of the best-paid city administrators in the nation with an 
estimated $122,400 in salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politically Astute 
</P>
<P>
All four council members praised Eckles, 48, a politically astute administrator 
credited with keeping the city's economy and services strong during years of 
rapid racial and ethnic change. Voting for the new agreement were Mayor Edward 
Vincent, Councilman Anthony Scardenzan and Councilman Ervin (Tony) Thomas. (The 
fifth council seat is vacant because of the death of Councilwoman Ann Wilk last 
month.) 
</P>
<P>
Eckles said: "The average tenure of a city manager is four years. I have been 
city manager 15 years. I think I'm a known quantity to the council and to the 
community. I don't think there should be any surprises." 
</P>
<P>
Council members said Eckles had earned an extension and improvement of his 
contract, which was in its third and final year. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can have you here for 15 more years," Vincent told Eckles, who came 
to the city as an assistant city manager in 1973 and became manager in 1975. 
"You have shown a true love for this city." 
</P>
<P>
Eckles said he has "a real good feeling" about the coming years. He said his 
top priorities are adding 20 police officers through a new police assessment 
tax approved by voters in November, maintaining the city's sound financial 
status and completing a program to recycle residential land blighted by airport 
noise for commercial and industrial use. 
</P>
<P>
Eckles earns a base salary of $106,432, officials said, with 15% in deferred 
compensation bringing salary and benefits to an estimated $122,400. The city 
also pays for his car. In 1984 the city lent Eckles $275,000 to buy a house, 
and in 1985 council members changed the interest rate from 11% to a floating 
rate tied to what the city earns on the money it invests in the California 
Local Agency Investment Fund. Eckles' current loan rate is 7.9%, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The new 3-year contract took effect Tuesday. It gives Eckles a 4.5% annual 
cost-of-living increase effective each July. The other major change in the 
contract is the improvement in the severance terms, which previously were fixed 
at six months' pay. The new severance agreement grants Eckles a week's pay for 
every six months he has worked for the city since he was hired in December, 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
The severance clause would take effect if the city violates the contract. 
Eckles also may declare himself "terminated" and take the severance pay if he 
feels that his duties are "materially diminished by charter amendment or 
ordinance," the contract states. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncertain Future 
</P>
<P>
Elections will be held in April for the council seats of Tabor, Scardenzan and 
Wilk. Another election is possible if an appellate court upholds the 1987 
annulment of Thomas' election. The possibility of four new council members 
contributes to uncertainty about the future of Eckles and other administrators. 
</P>
<P>
But Eckles said that although the severance provision is new, it is not 
unusual. "I'm not really concerned with that aspect of the future," he said. 
"We'll work with whoever is on the council." 
</P>
<P>
Tabor said he has full confidence in Eckles. But he said Wednesday that the 
council should have negotiated before giving Eckles a contract that "locks in a 
3-year deal" regardless of the city's fiscal situation and does not establish 
specific criteria for judging performance. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is not Paul Eckles," Tabor said. "The issue is that the council had 
a chance to negotiate and make a counteroffer, and it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
Other council members said at Tuesday's meeting that they had discussed the 
contract and Eckles' performance sufficiently and were prepared to act on it. 
</P>
<P>
Eckles said he does not object to a more formal evaluation, such as Tabor 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protective Language 
</P>
<P>
Tabor also criticized the contract language that protects Eckles from attempts 
to reduce his power. 
</P>
<P>
"Specifically, it provides that neither charter change or ordinance should 
affect his job," Tabor said in a written statement. "In other words, neither 
the vote of the people nor a vote of the City Council can change or alter his 
situation. It . . . potentially makes it financially irresponsible to increase 
the role and responsibility of the City Council, including the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Tabor, a self-described advocate of increasing community input into city 
government, recently accused the council of acting as a rubber stamp for 
administrators. He wants the city to consider increasing the power and pay of 
council members by having them chair committees that oversee broad areas of 
government operations such as economic development and public safety. The 
committees would work directly with department heads. 
</P>
<P>
Tabor said Wednesday that the contract raises an obstacle to such committees 
and to other initiatives such as a charter amendment, defeated by voters in 
1987, that would have given Inglewood a full-time mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's say the people vote to have committees," Tabor said. "Then he can 
consider himself terminated and collect all those termination benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Eckles said he is protecting himself because "no city manager wants to lock 
himself into the position of being a highly paid figurehead." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smooth on Surface 
</P>
<P>
Eckles, his two top deputies and the city attorney are white executives of a 
city that is 55% black and 30% Latino and has a predominantly black City 
Council. Despite the city's contentious politics, race relations are smooth on 
the surface, and racial issues are almost never raised in public. 
</P>
<P>
In saying Wednesday that race is not a factor in his opposition to Eckles' 
contract, Tabor said: "If I was putting together a management team to run the 
city, Paul Eckles would be a part of that team." 
</P>
<P>
But Tabor did say that his predominantly black constituents feel that the 
council has been a rubber stamp for city administrators and should do more to 
assert itself. 
</P>
<P>
Eckles said committees such as those suggested by Tabor are rarely used in 
cities with 5-member councils. They are more common in cities with larger 
councils, he said. But Eckles said "nothing stands in the way" of increasing 
participation by council members, adding: "I'm amenable to however the council 
would like to operate."

DRIVER CHARGED UNDER FELONY DRUNK LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Felony drunk-driving charges were filed Wednesday against a Pacoima man 
authorities believe is the first person in the San Fernando Valley prosecuted 
under a new state law that makes repeat drunk driving a felony offense. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Escobar Cisneros, 59, has had four drunk-driving convictions since 1982, 
said Head Deputy Dist. Atty. Billy D. Webb of the San Fernando district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros pleaded not guilty in San Fernando Municipal Court to one count of 
felony driving under the influence of alcohol and one misdemeanor count of 
driving with a revoked or suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
He was arrested Jan. 3 at Pierce Street and San Fernando Road. Tests showed he 
had a blood-alcohol count of 0.35%, Webb said. The legal limit is 0.10%. 
</P>
<P>
Under a law that took effect Sunday, drunk-driving defendants who have three or 
more convictions can be charged with a felony. Before Jan. 1, repeat offenses 
were charged as misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted, Cisneros faces a maximum sentence of 3 years in state prison. 
Under the previous law, the maximum sentence was 2 years in County Jail. 
Cisneros was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail.

LANDLORD ORDERED TO LET EVICTED RENTER RETURN TO APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Municipal Court commissioner on Wednesday ordered that a 60-year-old man, who 
worked from Thanksgiving through Christmas as a Salvation Army bell ringer, be 
allowed to return to his apartment, which he was forced to abandon for almost 2 
weeks after he was late paying his rent. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Barry said he slept in his 1979 Chrysler Cordoba or in a shelter for the 
homeless after he was locked out of his 1-room apartment at the Valley House 
Motel in the 9400 block of Sepulveda Boulevard in Sepulveda on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to live on the street," Barry said. "Now I'm aware of the problems of 
the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Encino Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph R. Ruffner issued a temporary 
restraining order against George Chang, the owner of the building, allowing 
Barry to return home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved that justice has been done," Barry said after the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said he owed Chang $240 when he was forced to leave his apartment. But a 
spokeswoman for the landlord, who refused to give her name, said Barry owed 
$300 and left of his own accord. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do anything," she said. "He moved out by himself." 
</P>
<P>
Ruffner scheduled a hearing for Jan. 12, when he will decide whether to extend 
the order. Chang, who did not appear in court Wednesday and could not be 
reached for comment, can argue against an extension at that time. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said he returned from collecting money for the Salvation Army about 8 
p.m. Dec. 21 and found the locks on his door changed. He said he was told by 
Chang that he was being evicted because his rent payment was overdue. Barry 
said he paid $40 of $43 he had in his pocket and was allowed back into his 
room. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned the next night, he said, the motel owner handed him his 
belongings in a paper bag and told him to find shelter elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he should have given me a chance to pay the rent," Barry said. "He 
knew I was having money problems." 
</P>
<P>
Michael F. Duran, who filed a lawsuit that led to the judge's order, said that 
the law requires a landlord to notify a tenant that he has 3 days to vacate. If 
the tenant refuses to leave, the landlord must go to court to force the 
eviction, Duran said, which could take as long as 2 months. 
</P>
<P>
"A landlord has no right to lock out a tenant even if he's behind in his rent," 
said Duran, an attorney at Bet Tzedek Legal Services, which gives free legal 
counsel to elderly and low-income people. "The way you deal with late-paying 
tenants is you come to court and you file an eviction notice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks Damages 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the court order, the lawsuit seeks $25,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said he is disabled because of a circulatory problem. He said he left a 
mechanical engineering job in Rockford, Ill., in August, 1987, and underwent 
surgery in Tucson in October, 1987. He said that it took him 6 months to 
recover from the surgery, and that he still has problems walking. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said he moved to Southern California in September in search of a job at 
an aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said he got by on $2,000 lent him by a friend until the money began to 
run out in late November. 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of another friend, he said, he become a bell ringer, which 
provided a minimum-wage salary and three meals a day. Barry said he worked 
40-hour weeks for about a month outside several San Fernando Valley shopping 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
Salvation Army Capt. John Purdell praised Barry: "It was a pleasure having him, 
and I hope we have him work for us again."

MOBIL BLASTS STUDY CRITICAL OF REFINERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Mobil Oil official on Wednesday blasted a safety study that blamed lax 
management for accidents at the oil company's troubled Torrance refinery, 
calling the report a "sloppy job" that contains major errors. 
</P>
<P>
The author of the study, which was released Saturday, conceded there might be 
"discrepancies" in the report but defended it as "an honest job." 
</P>
<P>
And at Torrance City Hall, where some council members had greeted the report as 
confirmation of their fears about the refinery, Mobil's counterattack was 
received with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
It was Torrance officials who demanded the $88,000 consultant study after a 
series of accidents at the plant, beginning with a thunderous explosion and 
2-day fire in November, 1987. Since then, in four separate accidents, one 
worker fell to his death, another was killed in an explosion, four workers were 
seriously burned and eight others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negligence Cited 
</P>
<P>
Mobil agreed to pay for the inch-thick safety report, which was written by 
Gage-Babcock &amp; Associates and the Mittelhauser Corp. It said evidence from 
Mobil and government agencies made it clear that negligence and unsafe 
procedures had caused accidents at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The report's main conclusion -- that the company was lax in enforcing its 
safety rules -- was based on a finding that few written disciplinary reports 
were drawn up for safety infractions. "Despite our repeated requests, Mobil 
could provide us with only four disciplinary action reports, three of which are 
dated April 10, 1979, or earlier." 
</P>
<P>
But Mobil refinery manager Wyman Robb told The Times on Wednesday that oil 
company officials never were asked to provide all disciplinary reports -- only 
a few. "We gave them four examples," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, 165 employees received punishment, including written 
reprimands, suspensions, demotions or firings, for safety violations between 
1978 and 1988. An additional 82 were punished for poor work performance during 
that time, he said. Some management personnel were given written reprimands in 
the wake of the November, 1987, explosion and fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, that exhibits a record of having complied with our own policies and 
procedures," Robb said. "To conclude that we are not following our policies and 
procedures because we only issued four disciplinary letters is . . . not 
correct. They didn't have all the story." 
</P>
<P>
William E. Backes, Los Angeles manager for Gage-Babcock, said it would be 
"unprofessional" to comment on Mobil's response to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"These things should not be solved in the newspaper and they should not be 
solved in the public forum," Backes said. 
</P>
<P>
He added, however: "We did an honest job as we see it. I don't think anyone can 
do a 100% perfect job of getting all of the facts that may be there and in 
communicating to a 100% degree of effectiveness with everyone involved. I'm 
sure that in any study we might do . . . there might be discrepancies." 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Mayor Katy Geissert suggested that Mobil should have given more 
information to the consultant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Comparisons Criticized 
</P>
<P>
"Mobil Oil knew exactly what Gage-Babcock was hired to do. I can't believe they 
wouldn't open up their files to prove they were dealing with discipline. There 
is definitely something that doesn't square." In the interview, Robb also 
criticized Gage-Babcock for making what he termed inaccurately drawn 
comparisons of Mobil's safety record to those of other refineries. 
</P>
<P>
In the first place, he said, the consultants used raw numbers of safety 
incidents, without computing rates per hours worked. Such computations show 
that Mobil has an average safety record compared to other refineries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, he said, when there were 39 incidents reported to the Torrance Fire 
Department, including fires, spills, vapor releases, industrial injuries, 
medical emergencies and odors, the refinery was undertaking a major 
construction project and had up to five times its normal work force on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication in the report that gives us credit for the number of 
people we had in here in that period," Robb said. 
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, when the consultants compared Mobil with refineries operated 
by Texaco, Unocal, Goldenwest and Champlin Petroleum Co. and found that Mobil 
had the worst or second worst safety record each year between 1983 and 1988, 
they failed to account for differing reporting standards for the various fire 
departments that serve those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said that the Torrance Fire Department has a stricter standard for 
reporting safety incidents that boosts the Mobil total. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas of criticism, Robb said Gage-Babcock was wrong when it said that 
the refinery's firefighting capability is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
He also said the consulting firm erred in saying that water pools found under 
propane tanks indicate that propane could form dangerously flammable pools 
there if a leak occurred. In fact, he said, the propane would vaporize, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And a suggestion that flammable vapors be monitored continuously during welding 
or other "hot work" is impractical and is not required at other refineries.

CRANE KNOCKS OUT POWER TO 800 IN UNIVERSAL CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A construction crane accidentally knocked down several power lines that 
narrowly missed an RTD bus Wednesday, interrupting power to 800 customers in 
the Universal City area, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the 4:30 p.m. accident in the 4100 block of Cahuenga 
Boulevard, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells. 
</P>
<P>
The passengers and driver of the bus got off the vehicle without incident, 
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Freudenberg, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Deparment of Water and Power, 
said service to the 800 residential and commercial customers was restored an 
hour after the accident. Utilities workers were trying late Wednesday to 
restore power to a sewage pumping plant nearby, Freudenberg said. He was not 
certain when that would be done. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the accident were sketchy, but Freudenberg said that the crane 
belonged to a movie crew that had been filming in the area at the time of the 
accident.

TOWARD JUSTICE FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fact that a new law firm is being formed in Orange County, where about one 
out of every 300 people is an attorney, is nothing to really get excited about. 
But the kind of law firm that is being formed certainly deserves community 
attention and support. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Public Interest Law Advocates (OCPILA) is no high-powered 
partnership dealing in investments or business law. It is a nonprofit, 
public-interest law firm. It will be representing the heretofore unrepresented 
-- the poor, the homeless, the aged and minorities -- oppressed, abused and 
neglected people denied the equal benefits of the government system and redress 
to secure their rights. 
</P>
<P>
The approach is not new, not even in Orange County. The Legal Aid Society of 
Orange County has been here for years. So has Amicus Publico, a group of 
attorneys who volunteer their time and take cases representing people who 
cannot afford legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
But those programs are limited in the numbers of people they can represent and 
hardly dent the overwhelming need. And they primarily deal in individual 
service. As a public-interest firm, OCPILA will be directing its efforts at law 
reform, tackling the institutions, public and private, that under existing laws 
are denying people adequate housing, medical care and benefits due them. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of public interest representation and litigation takes more time and 
commitment than such groups as Legal Aid and Amicus Publico have been able to 
adequately provide. They may be able to help someone obtain a specific rental 
or health treatment, but OCPILA will be taking on the "system" that deprives 
large numbers of poor people medical and prenatal care and fails to provide the 
adequate housing required by law to meet the needs of all segments of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
That active public interest approach also requires considerable public support, 
financially as well as morally. Fortunately, community attitudes seem to be in 
sync with the launching of the new public interest law firm. 
</P>
<P>
Recent public opinion surveys have shown that a large percentage of residents 
are greatly concerned with the high costs of housing. Only one out of every 
eight Orange County residents surveyed believed that taking care of the 
homeless is "no one's responsibility" and 43% thought that state and federal 
government should be responsible for helping people who cannot afford housing. 
More than six out of 10 people surveyed also supported rent control, requiring 
builders to provide "affordable housing" for people at various income levels in 
their new developments and were pro-choice on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a few notable exceptions, Orange County has lacked aggressive 
leadership in tackling the social injustices suffered by so many residents. A 
public interest law firm such as the proposed OCPILA can help fill that void 
and right some of those wrongs.

The preliminary hearing for Willie Ray Roberts Jr., accused in the slaying of 
an East San Diego girl, continued Wednesday with testimony by the man who 
discovered the body and by Roberts' former employer. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts, 33, is accused of several counts, including murder, in the July 12, 
1988, death of 17-year-old Melissa Orchulli and the June 29, 1988, beating of 
Maria Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
Leroy Thompson said he discovered Orchulli's body while looking for a house to 
rent. After entering a Euclid Avenue house through an unlocked back door, 
Thompson said, he saw the body in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
"There was blood all along the wall," he said. "I could see her head had been 
damaged awfully bad." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Birch, a landscaper for whom Roberts worked, testified that Roberts 
called July 12 to say he couldn't report to work because he had to meet with a 
parole officer. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing will continue today with testimony expected from the coroner who 
examined Orchulli.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DULZURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four people killed in a traffic accident on California 94 were identified 
Wednesday by the coroner's office as Marisa Marisca, 23; Rosa Garcia, 20; 
Cipriano Fernandez-Rueda, 19, and Edialberto Tinajero-Saucedo, 25, all of 
Tecate, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said the accident occurred late Tuesday afternoon 
east of Dulzura when a westbound tractor-trailer rig filled with bottled water 
toppled over while going around a curve and landed on the victims' car. 
</P>
<P>
The crushed eastbound car caught fire, killing the four occupants and starting 
a small brush fire. The fire was extinguished by members of the Jamul Volunteer 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, who were trapped in their car beneath the truck, died of burns and 
carbon monoxide poisoning, Deputy Coroner George Dickason said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said that after tipping over, the truck slid in the eastbound lane, 
striking another vehicle and injuring Manuel Campa, 26, also of Tecate. He 
suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities declined to say how fast the truck driver, Bobby Fanning, 31, of 
Chula Vista, was traveling when the accident occurred, but indicated that speed 
might have been a contributing factor in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP is conducting a full investigation, after which it will determine 
whether charges will be brought against Fanning, who suffered minor injuries.

LAKERS AGAIN FIND A CURE ON HOME COURT, 133-120 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM McMANIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As long as the Lakers remain in their comfort zone inside the Forum, all 
appears well and their slump seems merely to be a nuisance of the road. 
</P>
<P>
Once again Wednesday night, the home court provided an answer to the Lakers' 
problems -- at least until the next trip. Their latest recovery was a 133-120 
pounding of the Portland Trail Blazers that ran their winning streak at the 
Forum to 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
If you followed the Lakers only at home -- one way to avoid the recent 
unpleasantness -- you would think that they were slightly off their game. No 
big worries, though, and certainly no cause for roster-purging. 
</P>
<P>
But in truth, the Lakers came slinking back to town a shaken team after Tuesday 
night's loss in Seattle, their seventh straight on the road. Their offense was 
missing in action and their defense lax, and furrowed brows could be seen all 
around. Coach Pat Riley talked of impending changes, and Laker players talked 
of a crisis of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
None of those deficiencies surfaced Wednesday night before a sellout crowd of 
17,505, though. The Lakers (20-11) did an excellent job of masking their 
faults, as they have done all season at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
Their motivation took several forms: They wanted to make up for another road 
loss, reinforce their dominance at home and remain in first place in the 
Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
They reached all those goals easily. 
</P>
<P>
Behind Mychal Thompson's best game of the season (27 points and 11 rebounds), 
and with James Worthy (25 points) and Byron Scott (24 points on 11-of-12 
shooting) augmenting the offensive revival, the Lakers opened a lead of as many 
as 23 points in the first half and held off a series of second-half surges by 
the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers' turnaround from Tuesday night was dizzying, even to Riley. But it 
was not entirely unexpected, either, considering that the Lakers are the only 
team in the National Basketball Assn. that is unbeaten at home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mystifying to me," said Riley, when asked about the Home Lakers compared 
to the Road Lakers. "Good teams are not allowing other teams to go into their 
building and win. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference in us is the opposition, the arenas, our comfort zone (at home) 
and the hostility of the road. But (the road slump) is mystifying because I 
know we are a better road team than this. But we have to go out and prove it." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's victory, over a team that the Lakers struggled to beat by 1 point 
in November, seemed to indicate that the slump was not catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
"When we keep reading how vulnerable we are, I think they really wanted to 
respond to that tonight," Riley said. "We came out strong. We were defensively 
active. There were five alert minds out there." 
</P>
<P>
A.C. Green hurt the Trail Blazers early, and Worthy was a constant offensive 
force in the first half. Scott's only missed shot was on his first attempt in 
the second half; Michael Cooper found his shooting touch by sinking two 3-point 
shots, and all Magic Johnson did was register 18 points and 15 assists. 
</P>
<P>
But the big lift off the bench came from Thompson, who played 32 minutes in 
relief of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (4 points in 16 minutes). 
</P>
<P>
Once a big scorer when he played for Portland, Thompson long ago accepted his 
role-playing status as a Laker. But now that his role has expanded with 
Abdul-Jabbar's decline, Thompson believes it is time for him to contribute 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"Riles is giving me the chance to play more minutes, and I've got to be more 
productive," Thompson said. "He didn't have to say anything to me. I've been in 
the league 11 years. I should know that." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson made 10 of 16 shots and also had 4 offensive rebounds. In one breath, 
he said he is capable of posting such statistics in every game. In the next 
breath, though, he displayed shock. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just in a daze out there," Thompson said, laughing. "The ball just kept 
coming my way. I was like every girl at the Forum. Just keep your eyes on Magic 
and good things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who was downcast after Tuesday night's loss, liked what he saw on this 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally played a 48-minute game," Johnson said. "Offensively, defensively, 
everything clicked for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally had a lot of spurts, rather than just a few of them. They made 
their runs. But tonight, instead of them making a game (of it), we came back 
with runs of our own." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers shot 76% in the first quarter en route to a 13-point lead, 38-25. 
And, despite Portland's attempt to rally, they increased the margin to 72-51 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Portland, coming off a home victory over lowly Miami Tuesday night, made its 
most serious threat in the first 5 minutes of the third quarter. An 18-8 run 
sliced the Laker advantage to 80-69. The surge was led by Clyde Drexler, who 
scored 21 of his game-high 33 points in the second half, and Kevin Duckworth, 
who finished with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lakers retaliated with a 16-4 run that pretty much ended any further 
Trail Blazer comeback hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"We played as well in the first half as we have all season," Worthy said. "We 
had to remind ourselves at the start of the second half not to get lazy and let 
them back in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Another home victory -- and one against a quality team -- does not signal an 
end to the Lakers' troubles, but it obviously was preferable to the 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard so many times this season how down in the dumps we are and that 
we aren't any good this season," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people said we'd be in third place after tonight. We proved tonight we 
still have a good team, and I don't think people can say differently."

MORNING BRIEFING: HOLTZ CAN'T RESIST ()1 FINAL JAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the ballots were counted in the Associated Press college football poll and 
Notre Dame officially was named the No. 1 team in the nation, Coach Lou Holtz 
couldn't resist getting in a final jab at Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame (12-0) defeated Miami, 31-30, in October, but Johnson has been 
saying to anyone who will listen that the Hurricanes (11-1) should have been 
No. 1 because they could have tied Notre Dame by kicking an extra point with 45 
seconds left. Johnson says Miami gave the game and the national title to Notre 
Dame by trying a 2-point conversion pass that would have won the game had it 
succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known Jimmy Johnson for a long time," Holtz said. "I've never known Jimmy 
Johnson to give away anything except the check. We would have come back and won 
it. They'd have had to kick off. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have kicked it (the extra point). That was his decision, that wasn't 
ours. He didn't come over and consult me. I didn't send him a note. It was his 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
Add No. 1: Holtz pointed out that the situation this season is similar to last 
season's when No. 1 Miami defeated No. 2 Florida State, 26-25, after the 
Seminoles scored in the final minute but missed on a 2-point conversion 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've made it abundantly clear on a consistent basis that I have great 
respect for Miami and their football team," Holtz said. "But what's the 
difference between this year and last year with Florida State? 
</P>
<P>
"If (Johnson) did give it to us, I want to say on behalf of the entire Notre 
Dame football team, 'We thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Add Holtz: Before beating West Virginia, 34-21, in the Fiesta Bowl to nail down 
the No. 1 spot, Holtz was asked if he knew how to handle his first top-ranking 
in 19 years as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm no Barry Switzer," Holtz said. "This sucker's new to me." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, when told that the Irish probably will be ranked No. 1 again at the 
start of next season, Holtz showed he does, indeed, know how to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my," he said. "We've really got some problems on our team." 
</P>
<P>
Last add Holtz: During a speech last June in St. Louis, at the Associated Press 
Sports Editors national convention, he said: "I can assure you all of one 
thing. Notre Dame will win the national championship. Just when and who will be 
coaching then, I can't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
For what it's worth: UCLA, by finishing No. 6 in the final AP poll, has 5 
finishes in the top 10 in the past 7 seasons. Only Nebraska, with 6, has more, 
and Miami also has 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins also have won 46 games in the past 5 seasons, tied with Auburn 
behind only Miami (52), Oklahoma (51), Nebraska (50) and Brigham Young (49). 
</P>
<P>
USC has only 2 top 10 finishes the past 7 seasons and has won 40 games in the 
5-year span. Not only that, UCLA has finished in the top 20 in each of the past 
7 seasons, while the Trojans have been unranked 3 times. USC has not finished 
higher than UCLA in any of those 7 seasons.

<TEXT>
<P>
Pepperdine, coming off a 102-80 loss at home to sixth-ranked North Carolina 
Tuesday night, will play host to Boise State at 7:30 tonight at Firestone 
Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves have an 8-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
Boise State (8-1), the defending Big Sky Conference champion, won last season's 
conference tournament and advanced to the second round of the National 
Invitation Tournament. The Broncos are coached by Bobby Dye, former coach at 
Cerritos and Santa Monica community colleges, Cal State Fullerton and Cal State 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Dye's team has been holding opponents to an average of 58 points a game. Boise 
State is led by 6-foot 3-inch forward Wilson Foster, who is averaging 13.6 
points a game, and by two-time all-conference guard Chris Childs, who is 
averaging 13 points and nearly 5 assists. RAY RIPTON

USC WILL ATTEMPT TO COME OUT OF TAILSPIN AT CORVALLIS

<P>
After losing 3 of its last 4 games, USC's basketball team hopes to bounce back 
tonight against Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Beavers, 7-3 overall and 0-2 in the Pacific 10, have been 
inconsistent, USC Coach George Raveling respects Coach Ralph Miller's team. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a long time ago that you never count a Ralph Miller-coached team out 
of anything," Raveling said. "I'll bet you a guy could have made a good living 
over the years going to Vegas before the season started and betting on Miller's 
teams." 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers are led by guards Eric Knox and Gary Payton. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, a 6-foot 2-inch senior from Inglewood, is averaging 14.6 points while 
coming off the bench. Payton, a 6-3 junior, is averaging 14.4 points, 5.1 
rebounds and 9 assists. 
</P>
<P>
"Gary Payton is a lot like Ralph Miller in that he's never gotten the credit he 
deserves," Raveling said. "I don't know of a player and coach who have gone 
through their careers getting more done and getting less credit for it than 
those two guys." 
</P>
<P>
Although USC (7-5, 0-1) has matched its victory total of last season, Raveling 
is frustrated with the Trojans' inability to win close games. 
</P>
<P>
"We should be 9-3," he said. "We get ourselves in a position to win and we're 
unable to finish it off. It's like going to a party and you get to dance with 
the prettiest girl there and you're afraid to ask her for a date."

PITT KNOCKS SYRACUSE FROM UNBEATEN RANKS, 81-76, AT CARRIER DOME

Syracuse owns the Carrier Dome, except when Coach Paul Evans' teams come to 
play there. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Miller scored 22 points Wednesday night, and Pittsburgh knocked off the 
previously undefeated, second-ranked Orangemen, 81-76, in a Big East Conference 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how many people believed in us," said Evans, whose Panthers (7-4) 
have struggled this season after losing several key players to graduation. "The 
season was on the brink. This shows that we can beat anybody, but we can also 
lose to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Evans' Navy team upset Syracuse in the second round of the 1986 NCAA 
tournament, and Pitt has beaten Syracuse (13-1) in its last 3 meetings at the 
Dome.

NEW OWNER'S JITTERS? MORE TURN TO HOME WARRANTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SIMROSS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're buying or selling a home this year, you might feel more secure if the 
house were covered by a home warranty, a one-year plan that covers mechanical 
things that could break down just after you've bought or sold it. 
</P>
<P>
With a warranty plan that will cost between $245-$295, for example, you might 
save $3,500 on a furnace bill, $1,400 for repair of an oven/stove or $375 for a 
new water heater. 
</P>
<P>
Almost unheard of a few years ago, home warranty plans are becoming 
increasingly popular with buyers and sellers across the country. And some 
companies will renew the warranty on a year-by-year basis after the initial 
plan expires. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are tuning in on the warranty plans in a big way, too. During the 
first two quarters of 1988, almost 42% of the homes being sold in the state 
were covered by a home warranty, according to statistics from the Santa 
Monica-based Home Warranty Assn. of California (HWAC), established in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
About 110,000 home warranty contracts, valued at $32.6 million, were sold in 
the state through June of last year. That's a 24% increase over the number sold 
during the same period in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely advocate them to a lot of my clients," Long Beach realtor Peter 
Lowes said. "Whether they're buying residential or income property, it gives 
them peace of mind for at least 12 months for a deductible of $35 to $50. And 
the policy itself averages about $245 for a single-family residence. For an 
extra $110, you can get the spa or pool covered, too." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Optional Add-Ons 
</P>
<P>
Depending upon the warranty company, you may also get the air conditioner, 
washer and dryer or pool heater covered by warranty for an added fee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just additional protection and benefit to the seller or buyer," Lowes 
added. "Either the seller or buyer can purchase the warranty, or they can do it 
50-50. Or realtors can purchase one as a negotiating tool for the home they're 
selling or as a closing present to the buyer. But people should absolutely read 
the fine print of the policy to make sure they know what's being covered." 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, don't confuse a home warranty plan with homeowner's insurance. 
Home warranties mostly cover problems with a home's heating and cooling 
systems, plumbing, electrical and appliances -- such as water heaters, stoves, 
ovens, dishwashers and disposals. If you've got water damage from a leaky roof 
or had a fire, theft or vandalism, a home warranty doesn't help you. You'll 
have to check with your homeowner's insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"They certainly have a place in the market, but I don't think they're for 
everybody," said Mary Jane Ludwig, a realtor with Fred Sands/Marina del Rey. 
"I've used them a couple of times with clients purchasing on a shoestring. 
Financially, they've plunked down every dime to buy the house, and if an 
emergency would come up, they wouldn't have the extra cash to pay for it. But 
people who are fairly affluent aren't going to get involved in that." 
</P>
<P>
Ludwig said that she apprises her clients of the availability of home 
warranties, and gives them literature about them. But she doesn't personally 
recommend any specific company. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 10 companies in California that sell home warranties; six are 
members of the Home Warranty Assn. of California. But all are regulated by the 
California Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
According to an association spokeswoman, an average of 1.2 claims were paid on 
each home warranty contract sold in California in 1987, "significantly higher 
than the average number of claims per policy paid by other industries regulated 
by the state insurance department." Claims can range from a simple repair to 
replacement of a major appliance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agent's Protection 
</P>
<P>
The firms that sell warranty plans in Southern California are American Home 
Shield, the state's largest company, based in Santa Rosa; First American Home 
Buyers Protection Co. in Van Nuys; Buyers Home Warranty Co. in Burbank, and Old 
Republic Home Protection Co. in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had pros and cons from clients (about home warranty plans)," Ludwig said. 
"One customer in particular felt there was so much in the fine print in terms 
of exclusions that the policy wasn't very helpful. But on the other hand, if 
you're talking on the basis of a water heater or furnace breaking down, a 
warranty can save you money. Some agents have been using them for fear of 
lawsuits -- people who just sue at the drop of a hat -- or for extra caution. 
But I think they are mostly for people, buyers and sellers, who want to take a 
conservative approach." 
</P>
<P>
If you're considering taking out a home warranty plan, you should do some 
comparison shopping. One company may cover stoppages in drain lines; another 
may not. So you should make a detailed inquiry about every item that will be 
included in your warranty. 
</P>
<P>
The companies that issue home warranties do not do inspections, but issue 
coverage on the basis of the written disclosures and home inspections that are 
standard practice in home resale transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, if the seller is dishonest about something in the house, the home 
warranty company generally will not repair it if it is found to be a 
pre-existing condition or if it is an item that was broken before the policy 
went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Repairs, Not Upgrades 
</P>
<P>
"A warranty company will not upgrade bootlegged wiring in your house," said 
Phil Branson, president of First American Home Buyers Protection Co. and a 
former president of HWAC. "We're in the problem business and we fix things, but 
we're not in the fixer-upper business." 
</P>
<P>
And according to Branson, industry statistics show that "it's during that first 
year (of ownership) that things really go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
California home warranty companies offer their clients a toll-free telephone 
number to call for repair service. The company will send a repairman to service 
the item or replace it. The client pays the standard deductible of $35 to $50. 
The companies also offer 24-hour emergency service for homeowners with warranty 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
"This (warranty plans) helps realtors, too, because they don't get the phone 
call that something is wrong at the house. We do," Branson explained. "And it 
gives the consumer a company to talk with if there is a problem. If they're not 
satisfied with the work that's been done and they don't get results from 
talking with the company, they can then go to the Consumer Affairs department 
of the Department of Insurance. It's really an added protection for the 
consumer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hire Inspector 
</P>
<P>
Branson said his advice to people buying homes is to get their own inspector in 
addition to the one the seller has employed to survey the home. "Have him check 
the structural integrity of the house before you buy it," he said. "Whatever 
the cost of the house is, it's worth it to spend a few hundred dollars on your 
own inspector. 
</P>
<P>
"Then walk through the house prior to the close of escrow and run all these 
things -- start the garbage disposal, the furnace, the dishwasher," Branson 
continued. "Test all the systems. I tell people they shouldn't be shy. They're 
the ones buying the house. Then insist on a warranty. If you make all that 
little added effort, you've protected yourself as well as you can."

JACK SMITH: HIS COOKBOOK IS STILL ON THE BACK BURNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have a letter from my friend Duke Russell reminding me that our projected 
cookbook has not yet been published and is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
Duke says that in putting it off we have lost a "gold mine" and disappointed 
millions of potential readers. 
</P>
<P>
I'm afraid he's right. I don't know what happened. Getting and spending, I 
suppose, I lost my original enthusiasm. But it isn't too late. The idea is not 
dead. I'm sure our public is still hungry for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There we were," Duke recalls, "two thin, laughing writers, telling the world 
we had the recipe for a new way to eat and look great. We whetted millions of 
appetites by promising to write a book on how to stay thin. A big breakthrough 
in the battle against obese behavior was about to be." He reminds me that I 
touted the book four times in this column. 
</P>
<P>
"We had it all, Jack. Power, prestige, popularity, even political clout. What 
did we do? We let go of the idea. We let down a big portion of the world's 
population who are going about eating in the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
If I say so myself, our title was brilliant: "The Jack and Duke Way to Ecstasy 
(Including Ray Bradbury's Recipe for Canned Tomato Soup); or What Jane Fonda 
Didn't Tell You." 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't that stir your interest? 
</P>
<P>
As a teaser, I believe I have already given my own recipe for Abandoned 
Husband's Chili: (open can of chili and heat; open 1 bottle Mexican beer; eat 
chili, drink beer). 
</P>
<P>
Also, Bradbury's recipe: 1 can Campbell's tomato soup, 1 quart of milk, 1 pound 
of crackers. Heat soup, keep adding milk. Crunch crackers constantly into mix 
until you get what looks like a liquid pizza. 
</P>
<P>
Observing that those two recipes take care of dinner and lunch, Russell now 
offers his own recipe for breakfast: one of the 50 volumes of the Harvard 
classics and a quartered orange. 
</P>
<P>
For those who demand a heartier breakfast, he offers this: boil a cup of water, 
throw in 1/2 cup of 1-minute oatmeal; sprinkle in some California raisins, flip 
in a sliced half banana; stir for one minute, then put it in a dish, add some 
low-fat milk, and enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
That is more difficult than I hope most of the recipes will be, but it is plain 
and nutritious and certainly will serve to promote the ecstasy we are striving 
to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
"Selfishly I wish it were written," Russell adds. "It would save me a lot of 
embarrassment at dinner parties, picnics, barbecues, and power breakfasts. 
Instead of me telling friends and total strangers how I stay in shape, they 
could buy the book and do it themselves. I think there is a need for a thin, 
little volume containing a few simple recipes and a lot of mirth." 
</P>
<P>
The recipes are easy enough. Any man who has been getting his own breakfast and 
lunch for years has, of necessity, developed a number of successful recipes. 
For example, my recipe for weekday breakfasts: 1 cup dry cereal, 1 piece rye 
bread toast, 1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, nonfat milk for cereal. 
</P>
<P>
My recipe for Sunday brunch is rather more elaborate: two eggs over easy, three 
slices Hebrew National beef salami, 1 raisin muffin, 1 sliced banana, 1 cup 
champagne laced with orange juice. (The champagne may be eliminated if you are 
going to engage in some intellectually demanding exercise such as watching 
football on TV.) 
</P>
<P>
That is the sort of recipe we hope to put into our book. You can see that they 
are simple, healthful and satisfying. Anyone who follows the "Jack and Duke 
Cookbook" will certainly stay thin and be ecstatically happy. We will not ask 
anyone to follow it religiously. Our book will be nondenominational, but 
religion will not be proscribed. 
</P>
<P>
It was after I mentioned that we hoped to have Bradbury's recipe for tomato 
soup in the book that Bradbury graciously sent it to us with his permission to 
include it. If any other celebrities would like to be included we would be glad 
to have their entries. 
</P>
<P>
We would especially like to hear from Cher, Michael Jackson, Prince, Madonna, 
Eddie Murphy, Orel Hershiser and George Bush. Maybe Jane Fonda herself would be 
generous enough to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
We can't pay them, but each will get a free copy of the book.

MAGAZINES: STYLISH EXPOSURE LOOKING AROUND FOR MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it began a little over a year ago, Exposure magazine was strictly a 
creature of Los Angeles, a little bimonthly in an oversize format with no 
ambitions beyond the city. 
</P>
<P>
But that has changed with the current issue, which is being distributed 
nationally in about 90 cities as well as in Canada, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
While the numbers involved are still small -- a total of about 35,000 copies 
with 20,000 of those for this area -- the increased distribution represents a 
major expansion of ambitions for Exposure, says publisher Henry M. Shea Jr., 
who graduated from USC in 1984 with a degree in public administration and 
"stumbled" into publishing after a planned career in Texas real estate 
evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
Shea believes the magazine was able to sign a three-year contract with a 
national distributor because its blend of eye-catching photography, short 
profiles and articles about young musicians, actors and artists, fashion and 
the Los Angeles street scene has appeal well beyond the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
But then Exposure has made a point of being noticed. Editor-in-chief Cavin 
Shorter, also a USC graduate, said that from the start the magazine has been 
sent to such strategic places as art galleries, advertising agencies, record 
companies, club owners and other haunts of the trend-conscious. In return, 
Exposure has attracted a fair share of local and national advertisers who help 
make the latest issue a thick 152 pages, compared to well under 100 pages in 
some earlier issues. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a magazine that embraces undiscovered musicians, denizens of the 
social fringe and upscale consumer products, such as Camp Beverly Hills, Guess? 
and Benetton clothing and various brands of liquor. 
</P>
<P>
Each issue generally is built around a theme -- "Brits in Babylon" and "the 
'70s" to name a couple. The recent issue on the 1970s featured full-page 
photographs of such Me Decade landmarks as Richard Nixon, Patty Hearst, 
motorcycle river jumper and broken-bone expert Evel Knievel and film director 
Robert Altman, with brief updates on each. By far the funniest vignette was 
from Lance Loud who wrote his own recollection of what befell his family after 
it was made notorious by the landmark PBS documentary, "An American Family." 
</P>
<P>
"In 1970, television ate my family," Loud wrote, noting that the documentary 
was "to home movies what Godzilla is to the garden-variety lizard." He also 
ruefully commented, "The Andy Warhol prophecy of 15 minutes of fame for any and 
everyone blew up on our doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
But publisher Shea said Exposure, which bills itself as "the magazine for Los 
Angeles and beyond," really jelled only with the current issue -- with actor 
Mickey Rourke on the cover -- which surveys artistic and other rebels such as 
novelist William S. Burroughs, a Los Angeles street gang, the Animal Liberation 
Front, a Hell's Angels chapter president, actress Bette Davis and the band Guns 
N' Roses. A section called Expose spotlights rising talent in performance art, 
video and music. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular issue looks like a real magazine," Shea said. ". . . It's 
taken us about six issues to get our identity down." 
</P>
<P>
The issue's most striking feature is the photography, Exposure's strong point 
from the beginning. In addition to powerful portraits, the current issue 
contains a photo essay on runaway teen-agers in Los Angeles. In one photograph 
a group of teens slouches around a pair of candles in an abandoned house, the 
floor littered with potato-chip bags and beer cans. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the leap to national distribution, the problem now, Shea said, is to 
find financial backing to consolidate Exposure's presence in the national 
magazine marketplace. Although there have been tentative offers to buy the 
magazine, Shea said he has no intention of giving up control of Exposure, 
adding that he hopes to make the magazine a monthly in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ms. Honors Six 
</P>
<P>
"Sweet" Alice Harris of Watts and Anne Archer of Bel-Air are among the six 
women to be named Ms. magazine's Women of the Year today at a breakfast in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, the mother of 11, was cited "for giving the children of Watts reason to 
hope and means to achieve." The "50ish" grandmother runs Parents of Watts, an 
organization that sponsors programs for the homeless, emergency food aid, voter 
registration and health seminars as well as projects to help educate, train and 
employ young people. 
</P>
<P>
In its announcement of Harris' selection, the magazine reported: "As a welfare 
mother (then) with seven children, she joined Watts' looters for two days 
during the '65 rebellion. But she was also around to give advice when the 
architects and planners came to rebuild Watts after the riots." 
</P>
<P>
Ms. praised Harris as a mediator of gang disputes and benefactor of unwed 
mothers. An unwed mother who had her first child at 13, Harris was praised 
because "her dedicated work creates opportunity, health and harmony for 
neglected Angelenos." 
</P>
<P>
Archer, an actress perhaps best known for her role as the wife in the movie 
"Fatal Attraction," was picked by the magazine "for her courageous public 
pro-choice advocacy at a time when the fight to control our bodies is becoming 
bitter and violent. Archer's calm presence gives a deserved dignity to the 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
The mother of two, Archer was praised by the magazine for public appearances at 
last year's political conventions and for her support of the Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America, which she now serves as national public advocacy 
chairperson. 
</P>
<P>
Other women honored by the magazine are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sarah Brady, wife of presidential press secretary James Brady, who was 
seriously wounded in the 1981 attempt on President Reagan's life. Brady was 
selected "for taking up the cudgels against the powerful gun lobby and 
providing the power of personal experience as a catalyst for political action." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Environmental activist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, chosen for her 60-year 
fight to save Florida's Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Yolanda Serrano, a New York resident, picked "for waging war on AIDS among 
drug addicts and prostitutes." Serrano, who distributes condoms and bleach to 
sterilize needles and teaches about the dangers of AIDS in the city's South 
Bronx, was once called "the Avon Lady of AIDS," the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Television personality Oprah Winfrey, whom the magazine singled out "for 
showing women that we can climb as high as we want to and inspiring us to take 
control of our resources and make them work for us and for a better world." A 
double issue of Ms. containing features on the Women of the Year is due on 
newsstands today.

ART BUCHWALD: THEY'RE TRADING IN WHITE-COLLAR CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Art Buchwald 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a great deal of plea-bargaining going on between Wall Street and the 
government these days. Some defend it as the best and cheapest way of dealing 
with zillion-dollar crime. The trouble with this plea-bargaining is that the 
public has no idea if it got taken or not by the terms of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Take the case of Pixel, Bumrat &amp; Greed, the investment bankers who cheated 
their clients out of $2 billion. The government intended to charge Pixel with 
stock manipulation, mail fraud, forgery, homicide and statutory rape. 
</P>
<P>
But just before bringing the charges, Pixel's lawyer, Noel Contendre, showed up 
at the Justice Department and said, "My clients admit to nothing, but they are 
men of reason. If you promise to drop the indictments and publicly apologize to 
them, they are prepared to forget the matter." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Atty. Gen. Able replied, "We can't do that. Your clients committed 
every crime known to the SEC. They violated banking laws, securities 
regulations, fire codes, and then drove with an expired sticker on their 
windshields. We're going to throw the book at them." 
</P>
<P>
"You're really talking about nothing more than parking near a fire hydrant. My 
people may have occasionally resorted to playing it close to the edge, but it 
was only to avoid causing panic in the streets. Suppose we offer to pay a $100 
fine on the understanding that our little secret is never revealed to any human 
being on the face of the Earth?" 
</P>
<P>
"Are you kidding? Pixel committed the Wall Street 'Crime of the Century.' How 
will it look if I let them off with a fine? My intention is to send your guys 
on a slow boat to Dannemora." 
</P>
<P>
"Now just a minute -- we're talking about white-collar crime committed for 
greed. You don't send anyone to jail for that any more." 
</P>
<P>
"The public lost their shirts in the October crash and they're still mad. They 
are looking to us to protect them. I can't let your people off. America will 
say that I am soft on criminal racketeering." 
</P>
<P>
"What if Pixel agrees to pay $500 and put in 10 days of community service at a 
health club? Would that satisfy the hardliners in the Justice Department?" 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think so. But I might consider a guilty plea in which your clients 
agree to serve 30 days as valet car-parkers at the Westchester Country Club." 
</P>
<P>
"You must be kidding. Valet parking is cruel and unusual punishment. He only 
stole $2 billion. Wouldn't justice be better served if my clients were 
sentenced to 15 days retrieving balls from a golf-driving range?" 
</P>
<P>
"You better get serious, Noel. Unless you come up with a satisfactory proposal, 
we're going to go for a jury trial." 
</P>
<P>
"For argument's sake, let's say that my people admit they made a couple of 
mistakes. In addition, they agree to give back half the money they obtained by 
methods that might not be considered kosher. This should take care of the 
entire matter and everyone could just go about their business as usual. Mind 
you, I'm not sure if my clients will agree to that as they may have spent the 
$2 billion already." 
</P>
<P>
"It won't fly. There has been too much press on this story and we can't make it 
look as if the government caved in again. The only thing I would consider at 
this point is if Pixel gives back 60% of the ill-gotten gains, and all the 
partners serve as busboys in the Big Boy restaurant of their choice for one 
week." 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if I can persuade them to buy it. They're not going to accept the 
humiliation of working in the restaurants where they usually eat." 
</P>
<P>
"Take it or leave it. I have to go to a press conference in a few minutes." 
</P>
<P>
"Wait. Perhaps we could take the deal. But does it mean that Pixel has to admit 
any wrongdoing?" 
</P>
<P>
"Of course not. When it comes to white-collar crime, a plea of guilty means 
your heart is in the right place."

YOUR COINS: SEVERAL FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE PRICE OF DUTCH GOLD DUCAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I recently received a pamphlet from the Dutch Mint for the reissue of 
the double ducat, last issued in 1867. The price is $185. The coin is of .983 
fine gold and weighs 6.988 grams. With gold at $404.75 per ounce, if you divide 
that price by 31.1 grams per ounce you get $13.014 per gram times the 6.988 
grams the coin weighs. That equals $90.95 plus a $20 handling charge. 
Therefore, the coin shouldn't cost more than $120. My question is: Does the 
rarity warrant the price they are charging? Is its numismatic value that high 
the moment it is struck? -- A.G.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There are several factors involved in your question. The price of gold 
was quite low when you did your math, but you have the right idea. However, 
there are production and promotion costs that must be figured into the final 
price. Also, purchasers are speculating that such coins, which are essentially 
bullion pieces, will go up in value because of the low mintage. Sometimes they 
do and sometimes they don't. 
</P>
<P>
I've always maintained that if you like the coin and can afford it, buy it. If 
your intention is to make a profit, be very selective and cautious. Some modern 
issues do very well; others don't. Bullion pieces will always have their 
intrinsic value. It's the collector value that is unpredictable.

AIRLINE NO-SHOWS VERSUS OVERBOOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Isn't anything at all being done to keep the airlines from constantly 
over-booking their seats and bumping us passengers at great inconvenience to 
us? 
</P>
<P>
I had a confirmed reservation, and my ticket in hand, for a return to Los 
Angeles after spending Christmas with friends in Phoenix. I had to stay over an 
additional night because America West had overbooked the return by six seats. 
And I didn't even have my luggage, which did make the flight. America West did, 
however, refund my Phoenix-to-L.A. fare. I know -- and am not entirely 
unsympathetic to the airlines -- that they have so many "no-shows" for every 
flight, but surely at Christmas they must know that almost everybody with a 
ticket is going to show up, so why not eliminate the overbooking entirely? Or, 
at least, give priority to those who have already bought, and hold, their 
tickets? 
</P>
<P>
Also, it seems to me, with today's computers, the airlines could "talk" with 
each other, compare passenger lists and cancel duplicate reservations. -- L.S. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: A nice piece of irony here -- your luggage had better luck with America 
West than you did. It's a sticky and never-ending source of friction between 
the airlines and the public, because heck hath no fury like a passenger left 
standing at 2 o'clock in the morning in a drafty air terminal with a ticket in 
his hot hand that isn't worth the paper on which it's printed. The problem, 
according to Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of 
America and co-author (with Jack Galas) of the CFA's "How to Fly" book 
(subtitled "An Airline Survival Guide"), wouldn't exist if it weren't for the 
no-shows among us -- those passengers who see nothing tacky about making three 
reservations for the same day on different airlines and then showing up to 
claim only one of them. No-shows, Brobeck said, amounted to about 7 million 
passengers in '86, and while most passengers with reservations did manage to 
get on their flights, an angry 200,000 in that same year ended up as you did -- 
cooling their heels in the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
"And while it's true," he adds, "that computers would make it possible for the 
airlines to check for duplicate reservations, I'm afraid that it just wouldn't 
work -- you can always use your brother's name or an outright phony name. 
There's always a way." 
</P>
<P>
Because airlines can't increase their capacity simply to accommodate a couple 
of peak travel periods each year and because economic survival demands that the 
highest percentage of possible seats be filled, Brobeck says "a crunch at 
Christmastime is inevitable." Is there a solution? "We've been trying several 
things," Dick Schimizu, America West's corporate communications spokesman in 
Phoenix, says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Key Strategy 
</P>
<P>
The key strategy here, Schimizu adds, is to offer attractive fares, but to make 
them either nonrefundable or, at least, to require prepayment and with a 
penalty for the no-shows. "We're trying something else new, and I think America 
West may be alone in this. We have what we call 'flight-firming.' We call 
passengers with reservations to double-check that their plans haven't changed. 
But it's tedious and time-consuming and it may be too early to know how well it 
is working." 
</P>
<P>
Brobeck, who suspects that the airlines do increase their overbooking at the 
holidays, believes that the carriers could discourage the no-shows more 
vigorously than they do, by resorting to the very thing you recommended: giving 
first priority on overbooked flights to passengers actually holding tickets for 
which they have already paid. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, he adds, "priority goes to those who check in first." 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the closest near-solution to overbooking, Brobeck says, may be in 
consumer insistence that the airlines enhance their offers to bumped passengers 
to switch voluntarily to a later flight -- the standard inducement that, in 
'86, a full 70% of bumped passengers accepted. The goad here is Federal 
Aviation Administration regulations that passengers bumped involuntarily not 
only are entitled to a refund of their ticket but -- depending on the length of 
the delay involved -- must be further compensated anywhere from $200 to $400 
for the inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Might Think Twice' 
</P>
<P>
"So, why not let the free market place really work?" Brobeck asks rhetorically. 
"If airlines want to overbook by 30% -- the average is supposed to be 20%, but 
no one knows for sure -- then let them do so. But if they're up to capacity and 
have to give away, for instance, a number of free round-trip tickets to the Far 
East, they might think twice about their overbooking policy and scale it back 
to 10% or 15%." 
</P>
<P>
In short, there's no really satisfactory answer, at the moment, to the annoying 
position you found yourself in -- out on the street -- right after Christmas.

NEW AND USEFUL: TIME CAN COUNT FOR BOAT RACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just hitting the Southern California marine market is a new watch designed 
especially for sailboat racers. 
</P>
<P>
The Victory yachting watch -- the latest in Timex's line of sports timepieces 
that includes ones for skiers, surfers, triathletes and aerobics exercisers -- 
has a preset five-minute countdown timer with both digital and analog displays 
to warn the sailor that the start of the race is nearing. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the visual display, several alarms sound at preset times during 
the five-minute period. The Victory watch also incorporates a tack ratio 
computer to assist the racer in calculating when to turn the boat and position 
it for the starting line. A ring on the outside of the watch face can be 
manually set to keep track of high and low tide. 
</P>
<P>
The watch, with a suggested retail price of $75, also features a large, 
top-mounted start button for the timer, two chronographs with split 
time-measuring capacity, and a backlight on the face for night viewing. 
According to Timex, it is water resistant to 25 meters and has a lithium 
battery that should last about four years. A strap extender enables the watch 
to be worn over foul-weather gear. It's available at Performance Sailing 
International in Newport Beach or Sailing Supply Inc. in San Diego. You also 
can order the Victory directly from Timex by calling (800) FOR-TIMEX. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No More Polishing 
</P>
<P>
There's a new product on the market that cleans tarnished silver, silver-plate, 
gold, copper, bronze, most brass and most jewelry in about five seconds, 
without messy creams, rags and rubber gloves. Called Qwicksilver and just 
introduced by Silver Cleaners USA in Culver City, it works by an electrolytic 
process -- in your sink. 
</P>
<P>
Qwicksilver comes in a kit with a reusable 6x8-inch metal alloy plate and 16 
packets of an "activator powder." To clean precious metals and jewelry -- 
except for pearls and enameled items -- you place the plate in the bottom of 
the kitchen sink, fill with hot water and mix in a packet of the powder. Then 
place your jewelry and metal items in the water for a few seconds. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman explained that a low-density magnetic field is created by 
the plate and powder, which safely draws the soft sulfur ions of tarnish off 
the metal pieces. She said that the powder is nontoxic. It won't do any damage 
to your sink, or hurt your hands, so you don't need rubber gloves. It's also 
odorless. 
</P>
<P>
"The tarnish comes off in about five seconds, unless something is really 
heavily tarnished, then you'll probably have to immerse it several times," she 
said. "Then you just rinse it and wipe it off with a clean towel." 
</P>
<P>
The starter kit of Qwicksilver, with plate and 16 packets, costs $30, with 
powder refills available at $12 for 20 packets. Reorder forms come with each 
kit. In Southern California, you can buy Qwicksilver at the Broadway, Bullocks, 
J. C. Penney and Robinsons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lotto Fever Relief 
</P>
<P>
California Lotto players may appreciate a new invention called Lotto-Chek 6/49 
-- a system for quickly checking your Lotto card to see how many winning 
numbers you have. 
</P>
<P>
Each Lotto-Chek card is usable for four drawings. To use it, write down the 
winning Lotto numbers for that drawing and punch out the appropriate-number 
dots on the card. Lay the Lotto-Chek card over your marked game and you can see 
quickly and accurately which of your numbers is a correct one. This works only 
for Lotto cards that you mark personally, not for Quick Pick numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"Players of $5 or more have been complaining about how difficult and tedious it 
is checking the numbers," said Allan Turner, the Northridge contractor who 
invented the card. "I was at my parents' house during one of the big lotteries 
and my father had played $20 worth of numbers. He was checking to see if any 
had won and he said: 'I am never going to do this again. It's too 
time-consuming.' " 
</P>
<P>
Turner said he developed his Lotto-Chek card using a system similar to the one 
officials at the DMV use to check correct answers on the driver examinations. 
He plans to have them available at $1 a card in convenience and liquor stores 
in the near future, but currently is offering an introductory mail-order plan. 
A six months' supply (13 boards for 52 drawing dates) costs $12; one year (26 
boards for 104 drawings), $22. 
</P>
<P>
To order, send a check or money order to Lotto-Chek 6/49, 12077 Wilshire Blvd., 
Suite 700, Los Angeles, Calif. 90025 or call (213) 473-7000. Add 6.5% state 
sales tax. Handling and postage are included. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sonic Accuracy 
</P>
<P>
AccuTape, a new ultrasonic measuring device, should be helpful to carpenters, 
plumbers, electricians, and serious do-it-yourselfers. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by Measurement Specialties Inc. in Wayne, N.J., AccuTape can measure 
distances from two to 30 feet with its ultrasonic Polaroid sensor, computing 
distances to 1/10th of a foot. All you do is place the device flush with any 
surface and press the button. It displays the distance in feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It has better than 99% accuracy," said Mark Cappiello, vice president of sales 
and marketing for the New Jersey company. 
</P>
<P>
AccuTape has a permanent, sealed-in lithium battery that Cappiello says will 
last more than 10 years, is lightweight (5 ounces) and about the size of a 
package of cigarettes. The measuring device retails for $49.99 and can be 
purchased from Measurement Specialties Inc., 1133 Route 23, Wayne, N.J. 07470, 
(201) 633-0440.

And a dozen major public television stations have received $100.5 million in 
underwriting commitments for current and future programs. The funding is mostly 
from corporations and foundations, topped by a five-year, $57-million 
underwriting of "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" by AT&amp;T, Pepsico and the John 
D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. Corporations aren't the only ones 
writing checks. PBS further reports that December membership drives netted 
individual pledges totaling a record $18.4 million, up 14.4% from last year.

The Denver Symphony also will lose its conductor in June. Phillipe Entremont is 
resigning because budget cuts made his vision of the orchestra's future "like a 
bird being shot in midair." The symphony has struggled financially in recent 
seasons, and four months ago the symphony board announced it would seek 
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. After studying the 
situation, a panel recommended a budget for next season of $6.5 million, 
$800,000 less than the 1988-1989 budget. "This orchestra deserves much better 
than it got. It's really a first-class orchestra," Entremont said. "With the 
division of opinion between myself and the board regarding the orchestra's 
musical goals, I had no other choice (but to resign). I never cheat artistic 
matters." The symphony board accepted his resignation "with regret." Entremont, 
54, has been principal conductor of the Denver Symphony since 1986 and music 
director since 1987. ALEENE MacMINN

How do actors relax between matinee and evening performances? Tom Oleniacz, who 
starred as Scrooge in "A Christmas Carol" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre's 
Lyceum Stage, took time out Christmas Eve to marry the actress next door, 
Yolanda Lloyd Delgado, who plays the young bride Beatriz in the Rep's "Burning 
Patience" at the Lyceum Space. The honeymoon commenced with the final 
performance of "A Christmas Carol." "Burning Patience" returns to the Rep for 
one week in January.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: JAZZ EDUCATORS' MEETING LURES A 
HESITANT MARSALIS

This month's National Assn. of Jazz Educators convention may give San Diego its 
biggest single shot of jazz in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Big-time talent will take to the stage at Town &amp; Country's Atlas Ballroom 
on three nights, but the nitty-gritty will be the more than 2,000 jazz 
educators, musicians and aficionados expected Jan. 12-15 for clinics, new 
product displays and the chance to mingle with influential jazz figures. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who will make the scene is 28-year-old sax virtuoso Branford 
Marsalis, who decided, after initial reluctance, to become involved with the 
Southern Comfort "All That Jazz" Collegiate Competition. He'll play a set with 
the winning jazz band Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis, brother of acclaimed trumpeter Wynton, isn't performing because he 
thinks formal jazz education is essential. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people we idolize -- Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins -- didn't go to 
music school. If they did go to school, they were trained in classical music." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is he coming to San Diego because he thinks Southern Comfort is the right 
sponsor for a black jazz musician. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a black American, I was extremely hesitant to hook up with a liquor 
company. If you look at the situation in terms of advertisement, especially in 
the black community, the majority of things are cigarettes and liquor. But in 
the past five years, Southern Comfort has given $1 million to jazz education in 
America. That outweighs any stigmas that could be attached. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so few people willing to do anything for jazz, we'll take help from 
anywhere we can get it." 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis just finished touring with rock star Sting. "In a half-hour jazz gig, 
I play more notes than during a 2 1/2-hour Sting concert," he said. "Once you 
do a rock 'n' roll gig, it takes awhile to get your jazz chops back." 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis might jam when he's here. His father's coming for the convention, as 
is younger brother Delfeayo, who plays with one of the three collegiate 
competition finalist bands. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz/blues greats Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff opened a two-week run at 
Elario's last night. Alto saxman Crawford, who likes to play "as if I were 
singing a song," got his big break in 1958 when he joined Ray Charles' band on 
baritone sax. Even in high school, he backed up bluesmen like B.B. King, Bobby 
"Blue" Bland, and Junior Parker. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he hooked up with fellow Milestone artist Jimmy McGriff, a master of 
the bluesy Hammond B-3 organ. McGriff and Crawford have Ray Charles in common. 
The organist scored a hit in 1962 with his instrumental version of Charles' 
"I've Got a Woman," which made No. 5 on Billboard's R&amp;B chart and 20 on the 
pop chart. Though he also plays several synthesizers, McGriff's heart is with 
the blues and the B-3. 
</P>
<P>
A three-month gig has turned into a yearlong stint at the downtown Marriott for 
Los Angeles guitarist Ron Eschete. "The general manager, Joel Rothman, is a 
dear friend of mine, and a big jazz fan," Eschete said. "I've known him for 
eight or nine years, since he used to manage the Anaheim and Newport Marriotts. 
He always told me he'd use me if he got the right room, and low and behold, 
last December he called after he'd just moved to the San Diego Marriott." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Pike, Gene Harris, Hampton Hawes, Warren Marsh, Milt Jackson, Ray Brown, 
and Dizzy Gillespie are among the talents that Eschete's played -- and recorded 
-- with. In San Diego, he's performing with locals Hank Dobbs (bass) and Ron 
Ogden (drums). 
</P>
<P>
Eschete's wife and son remain in L.A. while Eschete lives most of the week in a 
room at the hotel, where he plays Tuesday through Saturday evenings just 
outside of D.W.'s Pub. He's recorded five albums, including two on the Muse 
label. A new album of Cole Porter classics (such as "Love For Sale," "Every 
Time We Say Goodbye," and "What Is This Thing Called Love") should be out 
within the next few weeks. A typical set roams freely from Porter to Parker, 
from Jerome Kern to Antonio Carlos Jobim. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm a song person," Eschete said. "I just like good songs." 
</P>
<P>
Eschete expects to be at the Marriott for at least another three months. 
</P>
<P>

BIG BAND CLASSIC PROVIDES NOSTALGIA, BUT LITTLE MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. JAMES LISKA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most appropriate theme for Tuesday evening's Big Band Classic at Ambassador 
Auditorium in Pasadena would have been "I've Heard That Song Before." 
</P>
<P>
While none of the 21 performers on the bill actually performed the tune, the 
audience that packed the theater no doubt could say those very words about 
every other tune offered during the 2 1/2-hour tribute. 
</P>
<P>
The third in the Big Band Era series, this concert's purpose was to rehash the 
white swing music of the late '30s and early '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Those applauding wildly the efforts of the Harry James Orchestra (a ghost band 
whose leader died in 1984) and singers Connie Haines, Art Lund and the Lancers, 
were, for the most part, cheering nostalgia. While the concert promised the 
best of James, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, the Pied Pipers, et al., what was 
forgotten was the quality that made those names musical institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The Pied Pipers, for instance, wouldn't have survived a single night had their 
singing been as out of tune as the Lancers' was. 
</P>
<P>
While the James aggregation -- populated, oddly, with youngsters whose parents 
were probably too young to remember much about the Big Band Era -- performed 
capably, albeit with not much spirit, Haines and Lund seemed oddly out of 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Lund, whose seven-tune set included a few megahits ("My Blue Heaven," 
"Mam'selle"), has lost most of his once-rich baritone voice. But his segment 
was unpretentious and pleasant enough. 
</P>
<P>
Haines, on the other hand, wallowed in embarrassing self-aggrandizement as she 
flitted about the stage coarsely whispering some of her hits ("You Made Me Love 
You," "Swing Time Up in Harlem"). Her voice, too, has suffered the ravages of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that these shows tend to take on a sideshow appearance, the 
saddest thing is that the life left in the era's repertoire is not explored. 
The songs deserve playing, not a mere rehashing that will turn them into museum 
pieces. A. JAMES LISKA

SAL MARQUEZ SURVEYS BE-BOP ERA AT VINE ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most valuable legacies of jazz's be-bop era is the collection of 
music -- much of it composed by Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie 
and Thelonious Monk -- that continues to be a vital source of inspiration for 
improvisers. 
</P>
<P>
Trumpeter Sal Marquez is a talented and determined bopper who has been making a 
valiant effort to re-examine be-bop with a group he calls, appropriately, 
Birdland Revisited. Monday night at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill, in one of his 
weekly appearances at the room, Marquez offered a select sampling of the 
compositions and the improvisational style he values so highly. 
</P>
<P>
Kicking the set off with a slow-starting but vigorous romp through "Solar," 
Marquez played a stylish, Harmon-muted solo reminiscent of Davis' crisply 
articulated work of the early '50s. "Ornithology," a familiar bop variation 
constructed on the chord changes of "How High the Moon," followed with a 
strong-strutting solo from tenor saxophonist Jim Marentic. 
</P>
<P>
The standard "What's New?" -- a ballad favorite for jazz players of all styles 
-- was less appealing, suffering a bit from a lack of cohesion in the rhythm 
section. Two final pieces, improvised on the familiar and much-loved chords of 
the blues and "I Got Rhythm," showcased Marquez's whirlwind up-tempo 
improvising. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the set concluded, it was clear that the be-bop foundation on which 
the trumpeter's music is based represents a sturdy support for a rapidly 
evolving musical personality. Marquez's playing may find its inspiration in the 
'40s, but his creative eye is focused on the future. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Marentic's dependable tenor work, Birdland Revisited includes 
Frank DeLaRosa on bass, George Gaffney on piano and Billy Osborne on drums. The 
group continues regular appearances at the Vine St. every Monday night. DON 
HECKMAN

WINE NOTES: VINTNER CALLS IT QUITS IN FACE OF MARKETING PRESSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Lipp feels that sales and marketing drive the wine business today, not 
quality wine, and for that reason he has closed his Mountain House Winery in 
southern Mendocino County and put the property up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
It is a sad commentary, said Lipp, that his small, premium winery could make 
such good wine and still frazzle his nerves and those of his partner, Michelle 
Turner, with frustratingly difficult sales. 
</P>
<P>
"The charm had gone out of the wine business," said Lipp recently in a 
telephone interview from his Sacramento home, explaining why he left the wine 
business. Lipp is a lawyer with the firm Downey Brand Seymour &amp; Rohwer in 
Sacramento, specializing in trademark and anti-trust law. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after founding the winery in 1979, moving to the property and 
operating it through 1985, he and Turner found the pressure of sales was 
running them ragged. He discontinued operations at the winery in March, 1988, 
and put the property on the market. 
</P>
<P>
"When I originally got into the business in the early 1970s, my role models 
were Bob Travers (at Mayacamas) and Donn Chappellet (at Chappellet)," Lipp 
said. "That was at a time when you could go up on the side of a mountain and 
make an aesthetic statement, and if you made a good product, the marketing 
handled itself. 
</P>
<P>
"But today the business has transformed into the point where marketing drives 
everything. Michelle and I woke up one day and said we didn't get into this 
business to hustle wine." 
</P>
<P>
Lipp built Mountain House into an award-winning winery and by 1982, he was 
taking gold medals at major competitions and receiving excellent reviews from 
wine writers. But still, he would struggle to sell the wine. 
</P>
<P>
"I would go on the road, to all the major cities -- Washington, New York, 
Chicago, Miami -- and I would get into the top restaurants and I would get 
placement on their wine lists. But each place would buy maybe five cases. Then, 
the following year, when I had a new release, I'd have to get back on the road. 
It just wasn't economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More a Commodity 
</P>
<P>
Lipp said that in the decade since he began in the wine business, he feels the 
image wine conveys to Americans is less and less a quality statement from 
committed producers to more and more a commodity. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways, the charm may have gone out of it as far as the consumer is 
concerned," he said. "The average businessman, the average consumer, wants a 
good glass of wine, and it's nice if it says Chardonnay. He doesn't want to pay 
more than $3-to-$4 a glass, and the brand means nothing. It's turned into a 
commodities business, and it's called Chardonnay." 
</P>
<P>
Lipp tried for a time to sell the winery as is -- lock, stock and barrels. He 
had no takers, so he sold off most of the remaining inventory, and is now 
looking to sell just the property. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would love to find a buyer who would continue to operate the winery 
as Mountain House, and he said he was prepared to listen to proposals from 
anyone who was quality-oriented and would not allow the wine under that brand 
to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
The property, with a Cloverdale address in Sonoma County, is 7 miles west of 
U.S. 101. It has 80 acres of land, 5 planted to Chardonnay; a 9-acre-foot lake, 
a winery and a four-bedroom Victorian home that was an inn and stagecoach stop 
in the late 1800s. There are also six other buildings, including a guest 
cottage on the property. 
</P>
<P>
The last vintage of Mountain House wines was 1985. 
</P>
<P>
UC Davis is offering a two-day course for novice wine tasters called 
"Introduction to Sensory Evaluation of Wine" and a one-day advanced tasting 
seminar aimed at those with experience in wine. 
</P>
<P>
John Buechenstein (pronounced Bix-en-stine), wine maker at McDowell Valley 
Vineyards in Mendocino County, will instruct both courses. 
</P>
<P>
The introductory course, scheduled Feb. 11 and 12 on campus, has a $225 fee. 
Buechenstein will conduct a series of blind tastings of commercial wines to 
instruct students in the proper method for evaluating wine and in how to 
develop a "wine memory." 
</P>
<P>
The class is limited to 50 students and early enrollment is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The advanced course, with a $120 fee, is scheduled March 11 on campus. 
Buechenstein will focus on the qualification tests prospective wine competition 
judges face and will include a segment on defect identification and the testing 
of tasting consistency.

ABOUT WINE: A RETROSPECTIVE OF THE BEST OF 1988: IT WASN'T ALWAYS A VINTAGE 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Times Wine Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking back at 1988, you'll recall that it was the year of the short harvest, 
of warning labels and more Japanese investments into wine. And 1988 was also 
the year when new wine organizations to defend wine from attacks by 
neo-Prohibitionists were formed, when the Mondavi Mission linked wine and 
gracious living, and a year in which prices for wine, foreign and domestic, 
increased dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
A two-year drought in California's wine country ended, but California 
experienced its smallest harvest in years, driving prices for grapes up beyond 
many people's expectations. (One Calistoga grower harvested 74 tons of Merlot 
grapes in 1987 and got only 19 tons in 1988). 
</P>
<P>
The shortage created curious situations, such as the fact that some Sonoma 
County wineries paid more for Zinfandel grapes from Lodi, bought on the open 
market, than they did from Sonoma County (which had been contracted for earlier 
at lower prices). To combat the shortage of grapes in California, wine makers 
turned to Washington state, which had a surplus. 
</P>
<P>
And planting of grapevines in hitherto barren vine land -- Glenn and Colusa 
counties, to name just two -- became so furious that grapevine nurseries ran 
out of rootstock on which to plant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Sampling of the Year's Events 
</P>
<P>
Tourists continued to inundate the Napa Valley, and the first stoplight in 
Calistoga's history went operational. 
</P>
<P>
The passage of the Omnibus Drug Bill in Congress meant that warning labels were 
mandated for the backs of wine bottles (as well as beer and spirits packages) 
by next November. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the year that Montage, Dominus, Arrowood and Roederer released 
their first wines to wide praise. 
</P>
<P>
Connoisseurs also were inundated in 1988 with a flood of great wine -- at 
unfortunately high and getting-higher prices -- because of the number of great 
vintages now coming to market. In particular, 1985 California Cabernets, not to 
mention the just-as-good 1984s; 1986 and 1987 California Chardonnays; 1985 
Bordeaux, 1985 Burgundies and especially the 1985 red wines of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Australia arrived as a force to be reckoned with as a fine wine 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the year that three great forces in wine died: the Baron Philippe 
de Rothschild of Chateau Mouton Rothschild; Renato Ratti of Abbazia 
dell'Annunziata in Italy; and Myron Nightingale, wine maker for Beringer 
Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Before the year just past is nothing but a faded aroma, a look back at some of 
the more tasty events. Interspersed here are my selections for wines of the 
year from California. This list may include a few wines that may no longer be 
commercially available, though a few bottles may be seen on some wine lists. 
</P>
<P>
Best New Winery With a Story to Tell: Richard L. Graeser Winery in the hills 
west of Calistoga. Graeser started his winery in 1985 and opened his tasting 
room last April 10, even though his prime Napa Valley property had been in his 
family's hands for a generation -- growing pears and prunes. Why no grapes? It 
seems that Graeser's grandmothers, Della Baker and Ruth Graeser, were anti 
wine. Both were founding members of a Holtville branch of the Women's Christian 
Temperance Union, called the Della Ruth Circle. "It was organized at a local 
Methodist church in the 1940s," said Graeser. Times change. Graeser now has 
grapes planted and is producing Chardonnay, Cabernet and Semillon.

Gewurztraminer of the Year: 1987 Navarro ($8) -- I could recommend this one in 
my sleep, regardless of vintage. The perfect spicy varietal character is 
combined with very high acidity to make this Alsatian-dry style of wine a 
winner every year. 
</P>
<P>
Strangest Trade of the Year: The shortage of grapes, due to erratic spring 
weather, wasn't fully known until harvest time and then some growers hastily 
advised wineries they could not meet their projections. Robert Pecota, who 
annually makes a delightful Nouveau Gamay Beaujolais, had pre-sold 3,500 cases 
of the wine when he learned from one of his Gamay growers, from whom he 
expected 50 tons of grapes, that he'd get only 19 tons. "I called Sebastiani 
Vineyards and they were able to get me Gamay grapes from one of their Gamay 
growers -- but I had to get them Napa Valley Cabernet in return." 
</P>
<P>
Merlot of the Year: 1985 Cuvaison ($18) -- Spicy and complex, but without the 
fatness of other, more broadly structured Merlots. The Cuvaison style, starting 
with the amazingly fine 1984, is to accent complexity and fruit, but with a 
cedary note from oak and a slight herbal/olive element from a small amount of 
Cabernet. 
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Year: Brother Timothy, for more than 50 years the wine master for 
the Christian Brothers Winery in the Napa Valley, was presented with a lifetime 
achievement award from B'nai B'rith. Ever active in promoting wine as a 
healthful beverage, and aware of legislation that would require warning labels 
on wine, Brother Timothy, in his acceptance speech, said, "When Christ turned 
water into wine, he didn't put a warning label on it." 
</P>
<P>
Chardonnay of the Year: 1986 Sterling Winery Lake ($20) -- Marvelous richness 
from the fruit and a gracenote of complexity that will grow with time in the 
bottle. The citrusy elements in the aroma, the understated depth, and the 
acidity in this wine are what set it apart from so many other wines that have 
only one element going for them. 
</P>
<P>
Scare of the Year: Dry Creek Winery installed a sophisticated burglar alarm 
system when it remodeled offices and tasting room, and after the bugs had been 
worked out, the system was turned on the night of the Sonoma County Wineries 
Assn. dinner-dance. During the function, owner Dave Stare got a call from a 
neighbor: his alarm had gone off. Off Stare went at high speed to the winery. 
"When I got there, half the sheriffs in the county were there, and they thought 
they heard noises upstairs, so they began to creep up the stairs with their 
guns drawn, just like you see cops in the movies do," said Stare. "Just then 
our winery cat comes prancing down the stairs." Stare said one of the employees 
left the cat in by accident. It had triggered the alarm. Within 20 minutes, 
Stare was back on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
Sauvignon Blanc of the Year: 1987 Dry Creek Fume Blanc ($9) -- Scares aside, 
Dry Creek continues to be the leader in stylish, herb-scented Sauvignon Blancs, 
and the '87 hits the same notes but with full and layered complexity. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointment of the Year: Buena Vista Winery finally decided, after a year of 
uncertainty, that it will no longer produce its Pinot Jolie, a marvelous 
rose-type wine made from Pinot Noir grapes. It had been a singular statement 
for a fresh picnic wine and was clearly better than most White Zinfandels on 
the market and aimed at a similar audience. 
</P>
<P>
Randyspotts Award for Creative Marketing: Guild Wineries came out with a line 
of wines under the Dunnewood brand, prompting super-upscale wineries Dunn 
Vineyards and Spottswoode to fume that their names had been misappropriated. 
Making matters more creative, Guild then opened a tasting room at Vintners 
Village in the Napa Valley, even though the company acknowledges that only 10% 
to 15% of the wine appearing under the Dunnewood brand will be from Napa Valley 
grapes. The wines are made in Mendocino County at the former Cresta Blanca 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Chenin Blanc of the Year: 1987 Preston ($6.50) -- Another tossup with the 1987 
Grand Cru Chenin Blanc, this wine won by an eyelash for its slightly more 
complex nature. Off-dry with a melony and citrusy element, fine for matching 
with food. 
</P>
<P>
Shovel Blanc Award: To Alf Burtleson, the man who helped wineries go 
underground. His construction company specializes in digging caves in which to 
store wine. In 1988, Burtleson did more business than ever before, doing 22 
projects for 19 different wineries. 
</P>
<P>
Semillon of the Year: 1986 Clos du Val ($9) -- This underrated grape variety is 
made into a wine by few wineries, and generally I like those from R.H. 
Phillips, Alderbrook, Duckhorn's "Decoy" and a handful from Washington State. 
Clos du Val's, however, is a classic, with delicate new mown hay and melon 
aromas, a round, full mid-palate and brisk food-matching finish. 
</P>
<P>
Dedication Award: To wine maker Max Gasiewicz of Fisher Vineyards. In 
September, in the midst of the harvest, Gasiewicz's wife, Diane, went into 
labor with their second child. The family's obstetrician, Ron Unzelman, is very 
interested in wine, and during Diane's 12-hour labor, "all we talked about was 
the harvest." Mollie Elizabeth was born without complications, but Diane was 
amazed; "She couldn't believe Ron and I were talking about Cabernet instead of 
the baby." 
</P>
<P>
Pinot Blanc of the Year: 1986 Chateau St. Jean ($10.50) -- I had a near tossup 
between this wine and the 1987 Congress Springs, but the St. Jean got the nod 
for a bit more substance in the finish. Both wines are superb substitutes for 
Chardonnay at a much lower price. 
</P>
<P>
Oops: During the Napa Valley Wine Auction, magnums of wine were placed in a 
nearby tent for the silent auction, in which bidders write in bids on bidding 
sheets. As the day wore on, and as the heat in the tent increased to above 100 
degrees, the corks in the bottles began pushing their way out of the bottles. 
Wineries vowed to replace all bottles that had bad corks. 
</P>
<P>
Cabernet Sauvignon of the Year: 1984 Hess Collection Reserve ($22.50) -- 
Amazing richness and depth for a wine so young. Its greatest element is the 
round fruit, cedary/toasty depth, and chocolatey notes that give this wine such 
intrigue, making each sip so different from the last. 
</P>
<P>
Milestone: Weibel Vineyards, located in Fremont, sold one-third of its 90 acres 
of land there in exchange for vineyards in Mendocino County, where the winery 
has another production facility. 
</P>
<P>
Pinot Noir of the Year: 1986 Williams-Selyem Rochioli Vineyard ($24) -- Opulent 
fruit aroma with a cinnamon/nutmeg note and very rich, toasty, complex taste. 
The new oak in this wine stands out now, but should fade into the background as 
the wine ages. Very limited in supply and sold out shortly after it was 
released. For a substitute, try the '86 Williams-Selyem Sonoma County or the 
lovely 1986 Gary Farrell "Howard Allen," both $16. 
</P>
<P>
Runner-Up Quote of the Year: Brother Timothy of the Christian Brothers, age 78. 
Asked if wine should age, Brother Timothy replied, "I don't know. But I do know 
that the older I get the better it tastes." 
</P>
<P>
Zinfandel of the Year: 1986 Quivira ($9) -- Perfectly honed spiciness combines 
with raspberry/cherry fruit and a delicate pepperyness. The ideal choice for a 
plate of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
Event of the Year: The Dec. 27 snowfall in Napa and Sonoma, making the bare 
vineyards look more like Germany than California. 
</P>
<P>
Johannisberg Riesling of the Year: 1987 Trefethen ($7.75) -- Another dry-styled 
masterpiece from this longtime Napa Valley producer of delicate, food-oriented 
Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
Most Expensive Nap of the Year: A Northern California grape grower went on a 
short vacation in the spring, leaving his vineyard in the hands of a relative. 
The relative turned off the vineyard's frost alarm because he didn't want to be 
disturbed. Frost hit while the relative slept, and the grower lost more than 
80% of his crop. Net loss: about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sparkling Wine of the Year: Domaine Mumm Brut Prestige ($15.50) -- Beautiful 
balance between California fruit and French complexity. This latest release is 
the best of the three non-vintage wines this Napa Valley producer has released. 
</P>
<P>
Most Curious Suggestion of the Year: The Assn. in Search of a Name staged a 
nationwide contest to seek a name for super-premium blended wines made from the 
Bordeaux grape varieties. One intrepid contest entrant, recalling that author 
Jack London once lived in the Valley of the Moon in Sonoma County, suggested 
that the premium blended wine be called Buck, in honor of the dog in London's 
novel "Call of the Wild." 
</P>
<P>
Wine Maker of the Year: John Thatcher, Cuvaison Winery. Thatcher has turned 
around the fortunes of this Calistoga winery rapidly, making great use of the 
winery's 300-acre vineyard in the cool Carneros region of the Napa Valley. 
Thatcher's Chardonnay, Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon are flavorful and 
balanced, without the excesses that make some wineries' wines top-heavy. And 
after only two vintages, Thatcher's Merlot (see above) has become one of the 
most stylish efforts in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Wine of the Week: 1984 Torres Gran Sangre de Toro Reserva ($8.50) -- Rich, 
ripe, gutsy wine from the Penedes region of Spain made largely from the 
Grenache grape. It has a taste more like a cross between Pinot Noir and 
Zinfandel with a hint of orange peel, and always is one of the treats coming in 
from Spain. The '84 or the soon-out '85 offer ample richness and zip to blend 
well with hearty stews and cool weather. Often discounted below $7, this wine 
can be consumed the day you buy it because of the lower tannins, but it will 
age beautifully for a decade.

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION AGAINST WORLD HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new year unfolds before us, aglitter with promise and hope. Perhaps the way 
to summarize the aspirations and realities of this time is to dedicate 
ourselves at the outset of 1989 to helping organizations that assist children 
in poor countries, especially the United Nations International Children's 
Emergency Fund, better known as UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the situation of these children, James P. Grant, UNICEF's 
executive director, paraphrased Dickens and described it as "the best of times 
and the worst of times." Today it is indeed easy to find reasons both to hope 
and to despair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Pluses 
</P>
<P>
On the good side: The world as a whole is becoming richer; knowledge of health, 
nutrition and agriculture is growing; and people in vast areas of the globe are 
becoming better fed and healthier. This is true in particular of the world's 
two most populous countries, China and India. India, written off by many 
Western writers in 1973 as a "basket case," now feeds itself and can even spare 
a little food for export income and relief of needy neighbors. It survived a 
difficult drought last year -- a triumph of the Green Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, UNICEF studies have shown that throughout the 1980s in at 
least 31 countries (16 in sub-Saharan Africa, eight in Latin America and seven 
in other regions) malnutrition has increased and educational levels have 
fallen. Close to 4.5 million children below the age of five die from 
undernutrition and associated infections as well as from preventable 
communicable diseases, including polio. UNICEF does what it can to reduce this 
catastrophe, and deserves our help. 
</P>
<P>
One important UNICEF program is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). This therapy 
prevents diarrheal diseases, frequent in malnourished areas, from killing 
infants. Oral rehydration salts are distributed in 93 countries. Packaged in 
premeasured packets, these salts can be mixed with water and administered to 
infants to keep them from becoming fatally dehydrated. Enough packets were 
produced last year to save at least half-a-million infants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Modern Irony 
</P>
<P>
It is an irony of the modern world that at the same time that breast-feeding 
has regained status and popularity in developed nations, both duration and 
prevalence of breast-feeding have decreased in poor countries. The introduction 
of other drinks and foods, often of low-grade nutritional value, has gained in 
these areas to the detriment of both the finances of poor families and the 
health and survival of their children. UNICEF has subsidized information 
services and the training of health workers to encourage breast-feeding in 
countries such as Lesotho, Liberia, Swaziland, Uganda and Gambia on the African 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
In other aspects of nutrition, UNICEF has worked to improve methods of 
evaluating the state of nutrition in children, especially in villages; to beef 
up efforts in nutrition education; to improve the quality of foods sold in 
streets of cities; and to fight goiter in countries such as Vietnam, Bolivia, 
Ecuador and Peru, where it is still prevalent. UNICEF has succeeded in feeding 
millions of children in war-torn areas of the Sudan, Ethiopia, Mozambique and 
Angola, and helps in introducing unfamiliar but nutritious crops in many 
corners of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities of UNICEF include the provision of pumps for safe water, basic 
sanitation, essential drugs, enhancement of the role of women as a facet of 
general development, and attempts to save children in areas of armed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Can Be Done? 
</P>
<P>
What can we do about the hunger and misery of children in so many areas of the 
world? As individuals, we can contribute to organizations like UNICEF that act 
as our conscience and our hands. As citizens, we can press for a solution of 
the current debt problem faced by many poor countries, whereby they send more 
money to the industrialized world as interest payments than they receive as 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
We can urge our national leaders to take the initiative in stopping the sale of 
"conventional" arms -- by the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, 
Israel, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, West Germany and others -- which drain 
the meager resources of already impoverished countries. 
</P>
<P>
You and your family, like ours, may have plenty to eat and much to look forward 
to in the year ahead. But until all children in the world are fed and 
protected, our happiness will remain strikingly incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Botulism Is Rare in the U.S., but Improper Storage Still a Villain 
</P>
<P>
Question: Botulism food poisoning is well publicized as potentially deadly. I 
am curious: How common is it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We're glad to say that in the United States, botulism remains rare. 
Between 1976 and 1984, 124 outbreaks of food-borne botulism were reported, 
involving 307 individuals and resulting in more than 20 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
While botulism traced to canned foods had decreased, unusual foods have been 
identified as the source of the problem. For example, potatoes wrapped in foil, 
baked, held for a prolonged period and then used in potato salad were named as 
the culprit in two restaurant outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Another unusual source identified in an episode about five years ago that 
affected 28 people was sauteed onions. The butter they were cooked in 
apparently shut out oxygen, providing the environment in which the spores, 
which grow rather rapidly, could germinate. 
</P>
<P>
In yet another unusual outbreak of this potentially disastrous form of 
food-borne illness, 36 individuals were made ill from chopped garlic in soybean 
oil that had not been kept under refrigeration in the restaurant. Up to that 
time, both garlic in oil and cooked onions were thought to be incapable of 
supporting the growth of these microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
In each of these cases, it is reasonable to conclude that if the food had been 
stored promptly in the refrigerator, the outbreak would never have happened. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are nuts low in saturated fat? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most are quite high in fat, which provides about 70% to 90% of the calories 
in many varieties of nuts. In general, you might almost think of a nut as a 
tiny bag of fat. Fortunately, many are low in saturated fat. For example, an 
ounce of pecans contains 187 calories and 18 grams of fat. Less than half a 
gram of that fat is saturated. Several other types of nuts, among them 
filberts, almonds and English walnuts, present a similar profile, providing 
between 165 and 180 calories per ounce, but about half a gram of saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
A second group includes nuts that contain slightly more saturated fat. An ounce 
of pine nuts, cashews or hickory nuts provides 145, 163 and 187 calories, 
respectively, but roughly 2 1/2 grams of saturated fat. Just how important the 
difference between these two groups is will depend on how many nuts you eat at 
one time and on how often you eat them. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Brazil nuts, which have 187 calories per ounce, contain over 4 1/2 
grams of saturated fat. The largest source of saturated fat, however, is 
coconut. Calorically similar to Brazil nuts, it provides over 16 grams of 
saturated fat per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
A notable exception to the generalization that nuts are high-fat foods: 
European chestnuts. An ounce of chestnuts contains just a single gram of fat, 
little of which is saturated, and it contains only 105 calories. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read in a magazine that fish is an excellent source of calcium. Is that 
true? 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally not, although there are exceptions. For purposes of comparison, 
we'll use some of the best dairy sources as our "gold standard." A cup of 
nonfat milk contains 300 milligrams, well over one-third of the adult 
recommended dietary allowance, or RDA, of 800 milligrams a day. An ounce of 
Cheddar cheese has 200 milligrams, and a cup of low-fat yogurt 415 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
At least two types of fish compare quite favorably. Both canned salmon and 
sardines, if mashed with the bones, can contribute considerable amounts of 
calcium. In that case, two ounces of salmon would provide 110 milligrams of 
calcium; the same amount of sardines, 250 milligrams of calcium. A cup of 
oysters contains 225 milligrams of calcium. And certain other shellfish, 
including crab meat and clams, provide considerably less -- between 50 and 60 
milligrams in a three-ounce serving. On the other hand, two ounces of broiled 
flounder or halibut would provide only about 15 milligrams, hardly making it an 
excellent choice in the calcium department. 
</P>
<P>
Other than dairy products, there are few good sources of calcium. Exceptions to 
this generalization include tofu, or soybean curd, as well as several 
vegetables. One half-cup of chopped broccoli or kale provides almost 90 
milligrams; of chopped turnip greens, 125 milligrams; bok choy, 125 milligrams; 
and collards, 165 milligrams. If tofu is prepared with calcium sulfate, four 
ounces will contain 145 milligrams. And an ounce of almonds has 60 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is important to keep in mind that while these are some of the 
better sources, small amounts from a variety of other foods -- including dried 
fruits, other vegetables and breads made with milk solids -- contribute to the 
total daily intake.

CULINARY SOS: BOMBAY PALACE'S CURRIED TREAT

<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR SOS: I had a recipe for Indian curried vegetables about a year ago. I 
prepared it once and must have thrown out the newspaper in error. It was a 
delicious recipe and I would appreciate receiving it again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MARGARET 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MARGARET: The recipe came from the Bombay Palace restaurant in Los 
Angeles. It's also in their cookbook, "The Bombay Palace Cookbook" by Stendahl 
(Caravan Publishers). The vegetables, by the way, may vary according to season.

DEAR SOS: I would like to find a recipe for Wild Rice Casserole similar to the 
one I had years ago. It was a perfect buffet dish to serve with cold ham or 
fowl. Now, in these days of diminished interest in meat, it would make a good 
main course. 
</P>
<P>
 -- RUTH 
</P>
<P>
DEAR RUTH: Well, how about this one? It's fairly close to the one you 
described.

</P>
<P>
DEAR SOS: Many years ago I had a recipe taken from The Times for a Mexican corn 
bread made from a mix, diced chiles, sausage, etc. The "etc." is what I can't 
remember. Can you help? 
</P>
<P>
 -- STAN 
</P>
<P>
DEAR STAN: You just about got it all. The missing "etc." is corn. The recipe, 
incidently, was a My Best Recipe back in 1974.

<P>
LOW-FAT FISH, CALORIE-SPARING SAUCES IN TUNE WITH DIET-CONSCIOUS TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With so much emphasis today on lighter eating, it's surprising to find there is 
still so much interest in nostalgic foods that are filling and satisfying. Yet 
stick-to-the ribs meals, such as rich and robust stews, filling soups and 
pastas in chunky aromatic sauces enjoy the same popularity they once did, but 
today they are made with low-fat ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
Recipes still call for whipping cream, butter, cheese or half and half; just 
less of them is being used. Team this calorie-sparing technique with naturally 
low-fat fish like trout and firm white fillets and the possibilities for 
low-calorie, high-protein menus are endless. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh apples make a delightful sauce for rainbow trout, although almost any 
fruit can be substituted in Trout With Apple Cream Sauce. Red grapes and 
Zinfandel come together to complement the delicate flavor of the fish in 
Rainbow Trout in Zinfandel-Grape Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
Crab Meat Focaccia, the pizza-like country bread from Northern Italy that is 
topped with fresh herbs and olive oil, is made with an easy-to-prepare pizza 
dough and topped with imitation crab legs for an elegant but inexpensive dish. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robust but Light 
</P>
<P>
Pan-Bake Pesca Pasta is another aromatic and colorful robust but light dish. It 
features low-calorie, low-fat cod fillets and fettuccine in a wine-kissed 
spaghetti sauce topped with green peppers, onions. olives and a sprinkling of 
Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
In Broiled Pollock With Shrimp-Butter Sauce, mild lean fillets of whitefish are 
topped with a savory shrimp butter sauce then broiled. The fish is basted 
during cooking to keep it moist then, while keeping the cooked fillets warm, 
the pan juices are slightly thickened and finished with white wine to become a 
light, glossy sauce. 
</P>
<P>
The last suggestion, Shrimp and Scallop Saute With Pecan Rice, is a rich flavor 
combination. The scallops and shrimp marinate in beef broth and beer, then the 
seafood is sauteed with garlic and red pepper and served over rice and toasted 
pecans. 
</P>

As consumers we are being inundated more and more these days with nutritional 
information. It comes at us from every angle, and much of it, I think, indeed 
does have an angle. Much of it comes to us compliments of somebody trying to 
sell us something. 
</P>
<P>
Television commercials for everything from calcium-enriched orange juice to 
polyunsaturated cooking oil try to convince us that their products are really 
the best for us. 
</P>
<P>
If you use product "X," you will be healthier, live longer and more productive 
lives, have lower incidence of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, 
hardening of the arteries, sexual impotence. Not only that, if you use product 
"X" in conjunction with "our proven diet plan," "our proven exercise program" 
or in a fat-modified diet including "our oat bran," "natural kiwi fuzz" and our 
special "raspberry dazzle" you can conceivably expect to "live well past your 
normal life expectancy. You have our word on it." 
</P>
<P>
It has, I think, gotten a little out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Like the Snake Oil Salesman 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion the seller of nutrition today is remarkably similar to the snake 
oil salesman of years gone by. "Right this way ladies and gentlemen, I hold in 
my hand the sure cure for . . . ." Today's society still succumbs to the 
promise for simple cures of any ailment, from the guarantee of quick, near 
miraculous weight loss -- like Oprah's -- to the more subtle promise of a 
dietary cure for diabetes or cancer. In my opinion we, in America, are 
bombarded daily with nutrition information that ranges from simply incorrect to 
blatant fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Grain cereals are beginning to advertise, "Contains no cholesterol." That's 
wonderful. Fits perfectly with "today's active life styles" and all that, but 
the fact is that unless the grains advertised were once made with animal fat 
(which is highly unlikely -- like making orange juice with apples), they never 
did contain cholesterol. So why are they now advertising that they contain "no 
cholesterol?" 
</P>
<P>
Is all of this nutrition information really worth anything to us at all, or is 
it mostly just hype? 
</P>
<P>
I picked up a flyer at the checkout counter of my supermarket the other day as 
I checked out my steaks, tomatoes and canned anchovies. It read: "Nutrition 
Therapy -- Chewable Oat Bran Fiber with apple pectin -- Nutrition Therapy 
chewable Oat Bran Fiber, 500 mg. is processed in a way that concentrates the 
protein, vitamins and minerals found naturally in oats. More importantly, 
chewable oat bran is high in water-soluble fiber, which medical research has 
indicated may be helpful in lowering cholesterol levels when used as part of a 
total dietary program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Big Red Letters 
</P>
<P>
The words "lowering cholesterol levels" were, of course, in big red letters. 
</P>
<P>
Reading the label and literature on some of our food products is getting to be 
a bit more complicated than reading a legal document. We need a nutritionist 
these days just as we need a lawyer to help us wade through the rhetoric and 
find reality. Finding one, however, is not nearly so easy as finding a lawyer. 
Lawyers are everywhere. There are 31 pages of attorneys listed in the Yellow 
Pages of my phone directory, but only 21 names listed between "nursing homes" 
and "nuts-edible" under the heading "nutritionists" and only two of these have 
"RD" after their name. There were several "Ph.D.s" and "MDs" but those letters 
don't often mean very much when it comes to nutrition. It is very possible to 
be a Doctor of Philosophy, indeed a world-famous brain surgeon and know very 
little about nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"RD" stands for registered dietitian and indicates that the person after whose 
name the letters appear has met the requirements established by the Commission 
of Dietetic Registration. Those requirements include a bachelor's degree, 
internship or equivalent program, a national examination and continuing 
postgraduate study. When you need sound nutritional advice about dieting, 
weight loss, reducing fat, salt, cholesterol, etc., don't rely on what you see 
on the television or read on the side of cereal boxes; consult a registered 
dietitian. 
</P>
<P>
To find one in your area, try your local county public health department, 
public health nutritionist, hospital dietary department or simply look in the 
phone book Yellow Pages under the heading "Dietitians" (it's between "Diesel 
Fuel" and "Disk Jockeys"). Don't look for "Nutritionists": Anyone can call 
himself a nutritionist.

MICROWAVE: FOOD SCIENTISTS APPROVE PORK IN OVEN . . . UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA , Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it OK to microwave pork roasts? 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning we were told no, that pork failed to cook evenly or fully in 
the microwave and, therefore, might not be safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
But food scientists have recently announced that pork can be safely microwaved 
if each of the following conditions is met: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The container must be tightly covered -- with a lid, not with vented 
plastic wrap. Covering pork, researchers have found, means that it will cook 
more thoroughly and evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The roast must be begun briefly on HIGH, then finished on MEDIUM, which 
ensures a slow, uniform cooking. It also ensures juicier meat. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The roast must be inverted and rotated 180 degrees when half cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The roast must reach an internal temperature of 170 degrees and then be 
allowed to stand 10 minutes. Always spot-check the internal temperature in 
several areas before removing a pork roast from the microwave, then again after 
it has stood 10 minutes. At 170 degrees the meat will be succulent and utterly 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
As for which cuts of pork microwave best, top-quality loins about four inches 
in diameter, either bone-in or boned and rolled, in the three- to four-pound 
category microwave splendidly. To figure the number of servings, allow 
one-third to one-half pound boneless pork per serving and one-half to 
three-quarters pound of bone-in meat. 
</P>
<P>
ROAST LOIN OF PORK 
</P>
<P>
1 (3- to 4-pound) pork roast 
</P>
<P>
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Crushed garlic 
</P>
<P>
Rubbed sage, crumbled leaf marjoram and rosemary or thyme, optional 
</P>
<P>
Trim away all but 1/4 inch exterior fat from roast, then score lightly. 
Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper and then rub with 
crushed garlic and rubbed sage, crumbled leaf marjoram, rosemary or thyme. Let 
roast stand 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature before microwaving. 
Refrigerator-cold meats are less likely to cook evenly. 
</P>
<P>
Do not salt roast. Salt accelerates heating and can actually toughen meat. 
Measure diameter of roast, then weigh to determine precise microwave time. 
</P>
<P>
Place roast, fat side down, on rack in deep casserole. Insert microwave-safe 
meat thermometer in center of largest muscle touching neither fat nor bone. Or 
use automatic temperature probe according to manufacturer's directions. (Probe 
is surest way to tell when pork is done although method is not recommended for 
roasts of less than 2 pounds.) 
</P>
<P>
Cover casserole with tight-fitting lid and microwave pork on HIGH (100% power) 
5 minutes. Reduce power to MEDIUM (50% power) and continue microwaving, 
allowing 14 to 16 minutes per pound for bone-in roasts and 15 to 17 minutes per 
pound for boned and rolled. 
</P>
<P>
At half time, turn roast fat side up and rotate casserole 180 degrees. Continue 
microwaving on MEDIUM until internal temperature reaches 170 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Let pork roast stand, still covered, 10 minutes. Test temperature in several 
places. If not at least 170 degrees throughout, cover and continue microwaving 
on MEDIUM in 5-minute increments. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: For Pineapple Sweet-Sour Pork, microwave pork to 170 degrees as 
directed. Drain off drippings and spread 1/2 cup Pineapple Sweet-Sour Sauce 
over pork. Microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM 5 minutes, basting with additional 
sauce at half time. Let roast stand, covered, 10 minutes. Transfer to hot 
platter, spoon some casserole sauce on top and serve.

CULVER CITY TURNS ARMORY INTO SHELTER FOR HOMELESS ON RAINY, CHILLY NIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Culver City has converted a National Guard Armory into its first shelter for 
the homeless on cold and rainy nights, and an average of 130 people a night 
have shown up to eat a hot meal, watch videos and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
The armory, 10808 Culver Blvd., is one of several in the state opened as 
shelters by order of Gov. George Deukmejian. His 1987 proclamation made the 
armories available as housing for the homeless when temperatures fall below 40 
degrees or below 50 degrees with a 50% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army operates the shelter under a contract with the county, 
supplying cots, blankets, personal hygiene supplies and hot meals, said Marilyn 
Leque, program coordinator for the Salvation Army in Santa Monica, which 
operates the Culver City shelter. The shelter is one of several in Los Angeles 
County financed primarily by a $325,000 grant from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Persistent cold weather has kept the shelter open almost every night since it 
opened Dec. 15, Leque said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
120 Seek Shelter 
</P>
<P>
On a chilly night last week, 115 men and five women sought out the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"I froze for three days before I found out about it," said Joseph Pembelton, 
who had been sleeping on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old man named Mark, who declined to give his last name, said that in 
cold weather, homeless people will consume alcohol in lieu of food for its 
supposed warming effect, then spend hours on some nights looking for a warm 
place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps you from being a prospect in the work force," he said. "You're 
concerned about the most basic of human needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The hazard of being out in the cold, it just wears on you. It breaks you down. 
It becomes a part-time job just sifting around to find a place and material to 
keep you warm." 
</P>
<P>
Although Culver City has no serious homelessness problem, the city was 
receptive when approached by the county about using its armory as a shelter, 
said Verta Nash, homeless coordinator for the county. 
</P>
<P>
Syd Kronenthal, director of human services for Culver City, said the city has 
never had a homeless shelter, but several local families already have called 
offering free clothes. "Culver City has been about as warm and as sensitive as 
any city could be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody empathizes and sympathizes with the plight of the homeless, but 
nobody wants them around them," he said. "But we haven't run into that in 
Culver City. To the best of my knowledge, we haven't had one complaint." 
</P>
<P>
Three other armories -- in Van Nuys, Long Beach and West Los Angeles -- are 
being used as homeless shelters, Nash said. The West Los Angeles armory, 1300 
Federal Ave., houses about 60 people a night, most of them from West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The Culver City shelter is for adults only, but parents with children are given 
hotel vouchers. Applicants who are mentally or physically ill are also given 
vouchers, as are the frail elderly, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
People who want shelter are picked up at the Clare Foundation's Sober Inn in 
Santa Monica, where they are screened for mental health and other 
considerations. They are then taken to the armory on buses provided by the city 
of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
After being searched for weapons, drugs and alcohol, they can take showers, 
watch videos such as "Three Men and a Baby," "E.T." and "Rambo III," and relax 
until dinner. The meal, which usually consists of soup and sandwiches, is 
served when all of the buses have arrived. A snack is served at 9:30. Breakfast 
is oatmeal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Washing Expenses 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Alan Robinson, commanding officer of the Santa Monica corps of the 
Salvation Army, said one of the biggest expenses is washing the 300 blankets, 
which costs $3 each. The people who use the blankets are asked to put them in 
bags labeled with their names so they can use the same blankets on successive 
nights. If the weather warms up and the shelter doesn't open on successive 
nights, the blankets are washed. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said the shelter is looking for a physician who can donate time. 
Although nurses are on call for emergencies, many of the homeless have chronic 
illnesses that could grow worse. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Hunt, 76, who said he usually sleeps in the woods near the Bel-Air 
Country Club, said the shelter was a welcome change. "I'd have come here last 
night if I knew it was open," he said one night last week. "It was chilly last 
night, but it's warm in here. They feed pretty good, too. It's not bad for 
free. Can't complain."

BEVERLY HILLS EASES STRICT SMOKING ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPP GOLLNER, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly two years after it passed one of the toughest smoking ordinances in the 
nation, the Beverly Hills City Council on Tuesday heeded restaurateurs' 
protests and adopted a substantially scaled-down law that exempts existing 
restaurants from strict ventilation requirements and allows smoking in 40% of 
dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised ordinance, which requires a second reading before becoming 
law, only restaurants that open after Jan. 1 must install the ventilation 
systems. New restaurants can avoid the systems if they install walls separating 
smoking and nonsmoking areas and if the sections have separate air sources. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance does not affect bars, lounges, private banquet rooms or 
restaurants in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law, which was unanimously passed Tuesday, represents a victory 
for restaurant owners who complained that the ventilation systems were 
expensive and cumbersome. The old law requiring the systems was passed in July, 
1987, after restaurant owners protested a highly publicized ban on all smoking 
in restaurants with more than 50 seats. That law, which the council passed in 
April, 1987, was considered one of the toughest smoking ordinances in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nonsmoking Space 
</P>
<P>
Walt Bilofsky, president of Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights, said he is 
disappointed that existing restaurants won't be required to install ventilation 
systems, but he added that he is pleased that the minimum space for nonsmoking 
sections was increased from 50% to 60% of dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, a complete prohibition on smoking would have been the best thing 
for nonsmokers," Bilofsky said, "but all the parties have approached the 
negotiations over this 60% separation in a constructive spirit. Of all the 
situations where cities and counties in California have enacted smoking laws, 
restaurants have been the most difficult because restaurants want to 
accommodate smoking customers. People like to smoke after dinner." 
</P>
<P>
Bilofsky said Beverly Hills is now typical of many California communities that 
set aside a minimum amount of space for nonsmokers in restaurants. He said 
Aspen, Colo., is the only city in the nation that he knows of that bans 
restaurant smoking outright. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Spivak, president of the Beverly Hills Restaurant Assn., said the systems 
would have cost between $7,000 and $25,000 to install. The city issued 
ventilation standards in September, 1987, that would have required "air 
curtains" to keep smoke from entering nonsmoking sections in large restaurants 
that did not have walls separating smoking and nonsmoking areas. In addition, 
the old law required restaurants to submit detailed floor plans and 
installation plans for ventilation systems before allowing them to have smoking 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the 60-40 (separation) is very reasonable and very livable, and we're 
very delighted to have the ventilation requirement for existing restaurants 
taken out of it," Spivak said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unworkable Compromise 
</P>
<P>
Spivak said the ventilation requirement for existing restaurants was a 
well-intended but unworkable compromise to the earlier outright ban on smoking. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of us will agree that a smoking ban in a small (city) surrounded 
by areas without a smoking ban was a disaster," he said. "The ventilation plan 
they came up with was kind of a way of getting out of it (the ban)." 
</P>
<P>
Approved ventilation systems were to have been completed and working by June 
15, 1988, but none were installed because the restaurant association persuaded 
the City Council to grant a series of extensions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is a very fair and equitable (ordinance) and it's been a long 
time in coming, but I think it's workable," said Councilwoman Vicki Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds and Mayor Robert Tanenbaum worked with representatives from the 
restaurant association, the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce and nonsmoking 
advocates to draft the law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RESTAURATEURS GET SOME BREATHING ROOM 
</P>
<P>
OLD LAW 
</P>
<P>
Required air segregation, filtration or ventilation systems for restaurants 
seating more than 50. 
</P>
<P>
Set aside a minimum of 50% of dining areas for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Required "air curtains" in restaurants without walls separating smoking and 
nonsmoking sections. 
</P>
<P>
Exempted bars, lounges, private banquet rooms and restaurants in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
REVISED LAW 
</P>
<P>
Requires ventilation and filtration systems in restaurants opened after Jan. 1, 
1989. Existing restaurants exempt. 
</P>
<P>
Sets aside a minimum of 60% of dining areas for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Eliminates requirement for "air curtains" in restaurants without walls 
separating smoking and nonsmoking sections. 
</P>
<P>
Exempts hotels, lounges, bars and private banquet rooms.

CENTER TESTS EFFECTIVENESS OF IN-HOME HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL KAHLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center is testing a theory 
proved in Europe but untried in the United States: that taking preventive 
health care to senior citizens in their homes is more effective than waiting 
for them to go to doctors for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The center has received a $657,143 grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation of 
Battle Creek, Mich., to launch a project that involves contacting hundreds of 
senior citizens in Santa Monica, providing free physical examinations and 
overall health assessments in their homes, helping them to get the medical care 
they need and following up on their progress for at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is successful, organizers believe it could send a message to 
health maintenance organizations and government health-care policy-makers that 
an ounce of prevention is not only better but also less costly than a pound of 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independence Is Goal 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to show that by visiting people in-home we can prevent early 
institutionalization and frequent visits to emergency rooms or hospitals," said 
Marcia Rossman, the center's community relations director. "Our goal is to keep 
them independent for as long as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after a similar study conducted in Copenhagen, the Kellogg project was 
conceived by two professors at UCLA's Multicampus Division of Geriatric 
Medicine -- John Beck and Laurence Rubenstein -- and by Bernice Bratter, 
director of the Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Copenhagen project found that a group of senior citizens who received 
in-home preventive health care had a significantly lower rate of 
hospitalization and death than a group that was not given any care, Rubenstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Similar studies based in hospitals have been conducted in the United States, he 
said, but a program of in-home care is unusual in this country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Expects 600 to Enroll 
</P>
<P>
To get names, addresses and telephone numbers of elderly Santa Monica 
residents, researchers at the Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center checked 
voter registration records and found 2,700 Santa Monica residents 75 and older. 
They plan to send letters to all 2,700, explaining the project, then plan to 
follow up with phone calls asking if they are interested in participating. 
</P>
<P>
So far, workers have mailed 250 letters and made about 100 phone calls, and 
about half of those contacted have agreed to participate, said Harriet Aronow, 
project director. She expects to enroll a minimum of 600 people in the program. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement to participate, however, does not guarantee respondents that they 
will be directly involved. Half of those who agree to participate, about 300, 
will be a control group for which no services are provided. Their medical 
progress will be compared to the half of the group given in-home preventive 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
At first, participants will be split into the two groups at random, but the 
process may later become more selective if too many of those chosen for in-home 
assessment are white, under 85 or in good health. Project coordinators want a 
large cross section of minorities who are over 85 and in fair or poor health. 
</P>
<P>
A 1985 census found that 6,186 people 75 or older lived in Santa Monica, Aronow 
said. If that number is still accurate, the study will involve about 10% of the 
Santa Monicans in that age group, with 5% actually receiving preventive care. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-January, those selected for in-home assessment will be visited by nurse 
practitioners -- registered nurses with additional education and training in 
physical assessment, diagnosis and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Israel, one of two gerontological nurse practitioners involved in the 
project, said participants will be given a complete physical examination and 
will be interviewed to determine whether they have mental or emotional 
problems, whether they are lonely and need friends, and whether they have a 
usual source of medical care. The nurses will also assess each participant's 
home environment for any health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekly Reviews 
</P>
<P>
If the nurses spot potential problems, they will suggest solutions and provide 
referrals if necessary. Once a week the nurse practitioners will meet with Beck 
and Rubenstein, who will review each case and make additional recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
"One goal is to identify needs before they have to be treated professionally," 
Aronow said. "If they do need professional care, we have a large network of 
services identified locally. For those people who have a usual source of care, 
we might just need to help them get an appointment." 
</P>
<P>
"The odds are that we'll pick up on things at earlier stages," said Kathyrne 
Barnoski, the other nurse practitioner on the project. 
</P>
<P>
A case history on each participant will be compiled, along with a "problem 
list" and recommendations for each problem, Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
After the first visit, volunteer workers will check back with each participant 
by phone as often as necessary, depending on the person's health. After three 
months, participants will be visited by the nurses again. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is a success, it will probably become one of the center's 
permanent programs, Aronow said. Success would be measured by reduced 
mortality, reduced emergency room use, increased use of community social 
services and improved health and well-being among those seen by the nurses. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, success could mean changes in health care that reach beyond 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Revolutionary Effect' 
</P>
<P>
If the project validates the theory that paying for prevention is more 
economical than paying for treatment, Rubenstein said, health maintenance 
organizations could begin hiring nurse practitioners to do in-home assessment. 
And government programs like Medicare could recognize that preventive health 
care for the elderly pays for itself in the long run, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it could have a revolutionary effect in terms of a push to provide 
better services for older people in the community," Rubenstein said. "Older 
people have not been getting the kind of care they need to optimize their 
health outcome. For a long time, that's been brushed aside because there has 
been a lack of data showing that they definitely would benefit from better 
services. 
</P>
<P>
"If studies come out showing that, without a doubt, older people live longer . 
. . as a result of some kind of inexpensive intervention program like this, it 
could have really revolutionary consequences."

CHANGE IS A WAY OF LIFE FOR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the faces of the children on its playground, John Marshall School in 
Glendale is changing. 
</P>
<P>
The single-story facade of the elementary school at Broadway and Chevy Chase 
Drive, familiar to generations, is about to become obscured. 
</P>
<P>
Construction began during the Christmas break on a $2-million, 2-story 
classroom addition that will overshadow the old building, reconstructed in 1937 
by the Works Progress Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The building will add 12 classrooms to the 4-acre campus, where the student 
population has reached 721 -- and is growing. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the classrooms are housed in temporary trailers tucked into nooks and 
crannies and encroaching on playgrounds. Classes for sixth-graders are 
relegated to the back lot -- cutting into the running track. 
</P>
<P>
Signs on doors reflect the diverse ethnicity of the student population, 80% of 
whom do not speak English as their primary language at home. "Welcome to Room 
18," beckons one sign, then adds: "Bienvenidos al salon 18." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Breakdown 
</P>
<P>
Students with limited English-speaking backgrounds include 260 Armenians -- the 
fastest-growing population -- 160 Latinos, 40 Koreans, 15 Vietnamese, 35 
Tagalog and 70 others ranging from Farsi to Romanian. Only 15% of the students 
are Anglo. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its diversity and overcrowding, Marshall is one of only 29 elementary 
schools in California named "exemplary" in 1988 by the U.S. Office of 
Education, an award granted to fewer than 2% of the schools in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Change is not foreign to Marshall. The school has had five different names and 
three different buildings since its inception in 1887. Overcrowding is a part 
of its history. 
</P>
<P>
The first school, named Verdugo School, was built on four lots on the Marshall 
site and contained three classrooms, according to a historical account written 
by Chester Baker Lynch in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
The name was changed to Glendale School in 1892, and already classroom 
additions were needed to accommodate the growing population. 
</P>
<P>
The school was holding half-day sessions by 1904, forcing construction of the 
first replacement -- handsome bungalows with fireplaces for heat that lasted 
until 1921, according to Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
In 1908, the name was changed again; the school was called 4th Street, the 
original name of Broadway. When the street name was changed in 1912, so was the 
school's. It was known as Broadway School until it was named after former U.S. 
Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
The boom that swelled the population of Glendale in the early 1900s taxed local 
school facilities. Enrollment at the school was 410 by 1907 and, even though 
new schools were opened, the numbers kept climbing. 
</P>
<P>
By 1921, voters had approved a bond issue for a handsome new schoolhouse on the 
Marshall site -- a 2-story Colonial-style structure with four massive columns 
framing the grand entry stairway to Broadway. The first floor of that structure 
is basically preserved today. 
</P>
<P>
Wayland Parsons, retired deputy superintendent of business services for the 
Glendale Unified School District, remembers that the second floor of the 1921 
building was declared a hazard following the devastating 1933 Long Beach 
earthquake. The second floor and columns were removed with the help of the WPA 
in 1937 when a new, industrial-style entry reflecting the Moderne architecture 
popular in the post-Depression era was erected. The building has remained 
largely unchanged since. 
</P>
<P>
Extensive renovations and expansions were undertaken on the arched east and 
west wings in 1950 and those, too, have since been mostly untouched, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The change with the new construction will be dramatic, signaling a new era in 
the school's history. "The population change at Marshall School mirrors what 
has occurred in the community," said Vic Pallos, district director of public 
information. 
</P>
<P>
The face is changing.

ROSEMEAD HOSPITALS' LATINO UNITS SPEAK THEIR PATIENTS' LANGUAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fernando sat at the table and gazed sourly at the irregularly shaped pieces of 
colored paper in front of him. Go ahead, the therapist urged him, fit them 
together. Joined correctly, the pieces form a big T, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what we call in Spanish a rompe cabeza," said Fernando, a patient at 
Ingleside Hospital in Rosemead, still keeping his distance from the puzzle. 
Translated literally, the Spanish expression for "puzzle" is "head-breaker." 
</P>
<P>
"That's right," said recreational therapist Arcelia Vasquez-Davis. "Pero no 
quiero que rompen la cabeza. But I don't want you to break your heads." 
</P>
<P>
The small group of patients laughed. Recreational therapy with a little Spanish 
frivolity? For Fernando (not his real name), who said his mind wasn't clear 
enough to match triangles and rectangles that evening, maybe it offered no 
great breakthrough, said Vasquez-Davis afterward. But the moment had provided a 
small opening for the others to reach a troubled patient. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando began gamely working with a partner on the puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is the point of Ingleside Hospital's new Hispanic Tract 
program: Give Spanish-speaking or bilingual patients, who often suffer from the 
special alienation of living in a foreign culture, a sense of attachment to 
their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Bilingual therapists, camaraderie between fellow Latinos, jokes in Spanish, 
cultural empathy -- these are rare commodities in private or nonprofit 
psychiatric hospitals, says psychiatrist Dr. J. Eduardo Guzman, head of the 
Ingleside program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Let Us Take Care of You' 
</P>
<P>
They're also immeasurably important, he said. "In general medicine, the patient 
comes to you with an inflamed appendix and says, 'Please, doctor, take care of 
me,' " says Guzman. "But in psychotherapy, we are asking the patient, 'Please 
let us take care of you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, Ingleside and another Rosemead hospital, CPC Alhambra (part 
of the national Community Psychiatric Centers chain), began offering those 
kinds of enticements to treatment for Spanish-speaking patients. They are the 
first such programs in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
At Ingleside, a 146-bed acute-care psychiatric facility, the Hispanic program 
means semiweekly sessions with Spanish-speaking occupational and recreational 
therapists, group therapy using both Spanish and English, and one-on-one 
counseling and testing by bilingual psychotherapists. 
</P>
<P>
It also means having bilingual nurses on duty around the clock, said Guzman, 
who heads Hispanic Health Professionals, a Montebello-based group of Latino 
mental health professionals who have contracted with Ingleside to staff the 
Hispanic program. "It makes a big difference if, say, your aunt or your 
grandmother is having a heart attack in the middle of the night and she can 
tell someone, 'Hey, it hurts me,' " said the psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
CPC Alhambra, whose administrators say more than half the population within a 
10-mile radius of their building on Rosemead Boulevard is Latino, provides its 
Spanish-speaking patients with bilingual therapy and a lounge where they can 
watch Spanish-language television shows. The 98-bed private hospital also 
offers Spanish-language reading materials, such as pamphlets from Alcoholics 
Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"Having bilingual staff provides an immediate bonding tool," said Jeff Thrash, 
program director of CPC Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
Until the two hospitals started their programs in September, psychiatrists who 
wanted to hospitalize Spanish-speaking patients had two choices, said Thomas 
Carrillo, a psychologist at Ingleside. They could send their Latino patients to 
county or state psychiatric hospitals, which are jam-packed with the urban 
poor, or to inadequately prepared private hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Middle Class 
</P>
<P>
"The assumption is that if you're Spanish-speaking, you're poor, and you go to 
state or county facilities," said Carrillo. "But that's a misconception. 
There's a growing Latino middle class. If something happened to my mother, I'd 
want her in a private facility." 
</P>
<P>
Both Ingleside and CPC Alhambra hope to attract Latino patients who are covered 
by third-party insurance programs, such as those provided by labor unions or 
large employers. 
</P>
<P>
Most private facilities, even well-meaning ones, don't have enough Latino 
professionals to go around, said Carrillo. "They're worth their weight in 
gold." 
</P>
<P>
The result is often "therapy via an interpreter -- which is ludicrous," said 
Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
Mental health professionals say Latino patients have all the usual 
stress-related problems of modern life, compounded by special cross-cultural 
stresses. 
</P>
<P>
"We see a great deal of depression," said Carrillo. "Mexican-born women, say, 
who were raised in a traditional way. They're thrown into a new environment 
here. Their children come home and they don't even speak Spanish anymore. . . . 
Men who had been dominant figures in their families. Now they're no longer the 
sole bread-winners, and they may even have a small child who speaks English 
serving as a go-between for them." 
</P>
<P>
Add to those disruptions an inherent reluctance to seek help for emotional 
problems, said Guzman, and the result could be serious mental illness. "By and 
large, Hispanic people are very private people," he said. "They don't like to 
share a lot of intimacies. It's hard enough eliciting confidences from them 
without going through an interpeter." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez-Davis attacks the problems with a combination of the familiar and the 
instructive. "It's real important that (the patients) be successful," she said, 
explaining the need for cultural sensitivity. "One day we had a cooking 
activity and we made guacamole. I knew they'd all be familiar with that." 
</P>
<P>
The recreational therapist tries to connect the activities she supervises 
directly to the patients' lives. How did Mrs. G., the middle-aged woman sitting 
across from Fernando, feel about working with a partner? 
</P>
<P>
"It was OK," said the patient self-deprecatingly. "I'm used to taking 
instructions." But a few minutes later, she was confessing that she was too 
passive in frustrating situations. "I'm calm," she said. "Too calm sometimes. 
That's not good." 
</P>
<P>
Fernando said working out the puzzle had been satisfying -- after he had sought 
help. "You gave me a hand," he said to Vasquez-Davis. 
</P>
<P>
"So maybe you just need to ask someone to give you a hand," said the therapist.

FORECASTER USES LATEST TECHNIQUES TO HELP GROWERS PROTECT CROPS

<P>
Being a man whose career can go from hot to cold overnight, Terry Schaeffer 
never leaves home without his digital thermometer. 
</P>
<P>
In the fertile Santa Clara Valley, he totes the device through citrus groves 
and prods it into lemons. In Oxnard, he romps through strawberry fields and 
pokes it into the soil. And, for driving in between, he hooks it to a sensor 
outside his car and watches the temperature flash, accurate to within a tenth 
of a degree, across his dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like some people are lost without their watch," he says of the $350 
instrument, "I'm lost without this." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer is the National Weather Service's meteorologist for Ventura County, a 
job that calls for two daily forecasts, a knack for farm lore and an unshakable 
belief that the whims of nature can be accurately predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Because, these days, as the digits on his thermometer start to plummet, 
Schaeffer's forecasts begin to carry the weight of papal proclamations for the 
1,600 farmers trying to protect their crops from the ravages of frost. 
</P>
<P>
"The buck stops here," said the 43-year-old Schaeffer, thin and bearded, and 
equipped with the easy manner of a high school science teacher. "I'm the only 
one who can screw up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$60 Million in Damage 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Schaeffer cannot ward off the frigid weather, which last winter 
caused $60 million in damage to Ventura County crops. But he can warn farmers 
about cold snaps several days in advance, enough time to ready the wind 
machines or smudge pots that can raise orchard temperatures by a few critical 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the first frost of the season, which descended Christmas night, was 
kept minimal, in part, because Schaeffer had predicted the sub-freezing 
temperatures to within a degree, farmers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows it's going to get cold, but you really need to know how cold," 
said Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail, who oversees the county's 
$600-million-a-year farm industry. "Terry is very good on his temperature 
predictions. It's a vital service." 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer, who spends summers in the Pacific Northwest providing forecasts for 
firefighters, begins his day about 8 a.m. with a review of the latest weather 
maps in his cramped Santa Paula office. 
</P>
<P>
Classical music plays on a clock radio, and a portable heater warms the cement- 
</P>
<P>
walled room as he studies the temperatures and barometric pressures being 
broadcast via satellite from Washington. A $5,000 color computer allows him to 
zoom in on any weather front in the Western Hemisphere through the eye of a 
satellite-mounted infrared camera. 
</P>
<P>
He says it takes about 3 hours to complete a forecast, which includes 
temperature predictions for 11 key agricultural zones in Ventura County, as 
well as two in Santa Barbara County. Farmers can hear the forecast on one of 
four radio stations or call an unlisted number, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
for a recorded version. 
</P>
<P>
But his office work is only half the job. During especially cold periods, 
Schaeffer often stays up blustery nights in the fields with farmers, taking 
temperature readings from their fruit, learning the climactic idiosyncrasies of 
each orchard and making friends. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not just weather forecasters; we have to be communicators," he said. "We 
have to know what the growers want and we have to give it to them on their 
level. . . . If you start talking about isobars and areas of positive vorticity 
advections, you're going to lose them in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
That folksy approach plays big with farmers, who chipped in to buy Schaeffer 
the computer, as well as the digital thermometer and the unlisted phone line 
that they use to hear his forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Learning Odds and Ends' 
</P>
<P>
"Most meteorologists look at their charts and their computer and that's about 
it," said Chris Taylor, manager of farming for the 3,000 acres of lemons, 
oranges and avocados owned by Limoneira Co. of Santa Paula. "He's out there in 
the middle of the night with the rest of us, learning little odds and ends and 
trying to fit in as a friend." 
</P>
<P>
But more valuable than his medium is his message. At least 95% of the time at 
all 13 weather stations in the two counties, Schaeffer says his forecasts are 
accurate to within 2 degrees -- a remarkable feat considering the peaks and 
valleys that separate Goleta from Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
On the same night, for instance, Santa Paula may register a balmy 53 while the 
mercury in Santa Barbara may dip to 29. One November several years back in 
Bardsdale, Schaeffer predicted a sudden cold front, then watched as the 
temperature plunged from 96 to 32 degrees in 24 hours. "Sometimes I amaze 
myself how accurate I am," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers sure appreciate it. Extreme cold causes moisture in the fruit to 
expand, rupturing the cell structure sometimes after just a few hours; 
strawberries are damaged at 32 degrees; avocados go at 30 and citrus at 28. 
</P>
<P>
With the proper warning, though, farmers have a range of remedies to protect 
their harvests. Wind machines with propellers sticking 35 feet above an orchard 
can circulate large quantities of air and pull warmer pockets down to the 
ground. Helicopter crews, flying back and forth for hours, can do the same. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scholarly Paper 
</P>
<P>
Diesel-fired orchard heaters, commonly known as smudge pots, are sometimes used 
to spread warm, thick smoke at colder temperatures. And, through a quirk of 
physics, plants can be warmed several degrees by spraying them with just the 
right amounts of water, a technique that Schaeffer explains in a scholarly 
paper he completed last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Terry knows the farming aspects of this area," said Steve Smith, general 
manager for Ventura County Fruit Growers, which serves as a packing house for 
220 farmers. "And Terry knows the farming aspect of this area. I have no doubts 
about what he tells me." 
</P>
<P>
Raised in the small Illinois farming town of Marengo, Schaeffer said he 
developed an appreciation for weather right after high school when he enlisted 
in the Navy. While at sea in the Far East on a large, flat-bottomed ship, he 
found himself the plaything of a large typhoon that battered the craft and 
tossed his crew mates from their beds. 
</P>
<P>
"I gained a healthy respect for the weather after that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He earned a bachelor of science degree in meteorology from Northern Illinois 
University in De Kalb, then interned at a weather bureau at the airport in 
Cleveland, Ohio. Twelve years ago, he came to Ventura County as part of the 
Fruit Frost Service, a federal program developed in 1917 that provides 
agricultural regions with their own forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enjoys Camaraderie 
</P>
<P>
As part of the job, he spends summers in the wooded areas of Oregon, Washington 
and Idaho, where he keeps firefighters up-to-date on fluctuations in 
temperature and wind direction. Schaeffer, who usually takes his wife and two 
children along, says he enjoys the camaraderie he encounters at the fire's 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like being in a war -- everyone together for the same goal," he 
said. "The esprit de corps is really high." 
</P>
<P>
But Schaeffer, who boasts license plates that read FROSTER, says his heart is 
not in fire, but in ice. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been so sick that I've had to lie on the floor looking at maps with a 
bucket next to me," he said. "You're talking about a highly motivated guy. But 
I think I do my best forecasting under pressure. . . . I get more intense . . . 
my voice goes down an octave . . . and the adrenaline gets flowing."

PREDICTIONS OF SEABEE BASE'S DEMISE MISS ON ALL COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reports of the death of the Seabee base in Port Hueneme turned out to be 
greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
So too were the obituaries of dozens of other bases that were not targeted for 
closure on the Pentagon's long-awaited "hit list" last week, despite published 
reports of their imminent demise. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, an Oct. 24 article in U.S. News &amp; World Report sent Ventura 
County reeling with rumors that the Naval Construction Battalion Center might 
be shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was the base spared, but of the 50 other military facilities mentioned 
as potential targets in the article, only nine were actually recommended for 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
Port Hueneme's good fortune did not surprise Capt. Brian J. O'Connell, 
commanding officer of the Naval Construction Battalion Center, who was 
confident that any talk of the Seabee base's closure was mere conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt secure that we were needed," O'Connell said. "But it's still nice for 
the peace of mind of our employees to put this all behind them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Months of Speculation 
</P>
<P>
After months of speculation, the 12-member Commission on Base Realignment and 
Closure recommended last Thursday that Congress shut down 86 U.S. military 
bases and partly close or realign 59 others. The bipartisan commission, formed 
to rid the military of obsolete or duplicative facilities, estimated that the 
savings would be $5.6 billion over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has until Jan. 15 to reject or accept the 
list. If approved by Congress, the closures could begin by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that the Seabee base might be a target surfaced after the U.S. News 
&amp; World Report article included the facility on a list of bases that 
officials "are likely to focus on . . . as potential targets." 
</P>
<P>
The text of the three-page story did not mention the Seabee base, and no 
attribution was given for the source of the list. The reporter, Robert Kaylor, 
could not be reached for comment this week. 
</P>
<P>
The only bases mentioned in the magazine to end up on the Pentagon's list were 
Mather Air Force Base, Calif.; Pease Air Force Base, N.H.; Ft. Dix Army Basic 
Training Center, N.J.; Jefferson Proving Ground, Ind.; Ft. Wingate Depot, N.M.; 
Ft. Douglas, Utah; Ft. Sheridan, Ill.; the Army Material Technology Laboratory, 
Mass., and the proposed naval station at Hunters Point in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation was fueled shortly after the article appeared when the Navy Times, 
an independent naval publication, also listed the Seabee base as a possible 
target. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times list of possible closure candidates in California also 
proved wide of the mark. Of 14 bases considered likely targets for closure or 
reduction, only two were on the Pentagon list. The Times listed the Naval 
Hospital at Port Hueneme, which also was not on he list. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5,000 Civilian Employees 
</P>
<P>
O'Connell, however, said the Seabee base, which is headquarters for 5,000 
civilian employees and 4,600 military personnel, plays a key role in 
maintaining U.S. strategic forces overseas. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for instance, it will be home base for 600 Seabees, who will venture 
to military installations in the South Pacific to build and repair a wide range 
of Navy facilities. The 1,600-acre base is also home to the Seabee College, 
where enlisted men can take nine- to 12-week courses in construction trades. 
</P>
<P>
The base, which shipped out more supplies than any other U.S. port during World 
War II, serves as headquarters for an underwater construction team of 42 divers 
who repair seafront facilities, as well as underwater cables and pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Operation Deep Freeze has been located at the base since 1975. 
Each fall, about 2,000 personnel and 2 million tons of cargo are shipped from 
Port Hueneme to Antarctica, where they join with New Zealand forces to conduct 
research in the coldest and driest place on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Established in 1942, the base was popularized by the John Wayne movie, "The 
Fighting Seabees." It is estimated to pump more than $1.2 billion a year into 
the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We are active," O'Connell said. "We are ready to mobilize if there is an 
overseas conflict that requires construction."

COLLEGE TO CUT STAFF, BUT NOT ITS STUDENT AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Whittier College officials, while acknowledging that the school's liberal 
financial aid policy contributed to a decade of money problems, last week vowed 
to continue helping needy students. 
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment to financial aid will not change," said Susan Pearce, vice 
president for college advancement, as college officials attempted to work out 
details of plans to bring the school's spending into line with revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a very strong step forward academically," said College President 
Eugene S. Mills, referring to the 101-year-old college's growing academic 
reputation. "Financial aid was part of that commitment, and we will continue to 
have a strong commitment in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the 950-student college announced plans recently to eliminate 
nearly 10% of its teaching and administrative positions by the end of the 
school year. The college would have faced an operating deficit of at least 
$262,000 by the end of June if spending changes had not been made, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Budget Strained 
</P>
<P>
Salaries at the private, Quaker-founded college, located in a quiet residential 
area west of the Uptown business district, make up much of the $20-million 
operating budget, college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
They acknowledged, however, that financial aid programs strained the college's 
finances, and were partly responsible for virtually depleting a $5-million 
reserve fund over an 11-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Although tuition has tripled from $3,500 in 1978-79 to $10,500 today, Whittier 
College's contribution to overall financial-aid funding in the same period has 
increased more than tenfold from $368,602 to $3.8 million, Finance Director 
Joseph E. Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
That increase, as well as overly optimistic projections of student enrollment, 
caused the college to spend more money than it took in for nine of the past 11 
years, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of students receive some sort of financial aid, a figure that is not 
unusual for colleges and universities. But Whittier College last year spent 
about 20% of its operating budget on financial aid, as much as 9 percentage 
points more than colleges of comparable size in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier's comparatively low endowment contributed to the higher allocation of 
operating income to financial aid. The college has an endowment fund of $16 
million, compared to a $250-million endowment fund at Pomona College and a 
$430-million endowment at Caltech, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
Most other colleges, with much larger endowments, set aside a smaller 
percentage of their operating budgets for financial aid, Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
At Pomona College, for example, 12% of the college's operating budget went to 
financial aid. Occidental College allocated 16% of its operating funds to aid 
students, and Harvey Mudd College devoted 11% of its operating budget to 
financial aid, according to those schools' financial records. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the $3.8 million of college funds for financial aid, another 
$3.4 million in federal, state and restricted funds have been distributed this 
year by the college's financial aid office, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a commitment here in general that nobody should be turned away 
for getting an education here because of financial difficulties," sociology 
professor Les Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to put together packages that make education possible" for 
students who cannot otherwise afford it, Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Focus 
</P>
<P>
Whittier College's increase in financial aid coincided with the 1979 hiring of 
Mills and a plan by college staff to change the focus of the school's liberal 
arts curriculum and seek a national reputation in academic excellence, college 
officials said. Mills will leave in June to complete a research project. 
</P>
<P>
"We made the commitment to make a difference" in the academic programs, Dean of 
Students Robert B. Marks said. "We set out to achieve academic recognition, and 
we achieved that." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Whittier College was ranked the fourth best small, comprehensive 
college in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report in October. The weekly 
news magazine devotes an issue each year to judging the academic quality of 125 
domestic colleges and universities. The year before, Whittier College was voted 
third in the same category. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine cited Whittier College's 7-year-old Liberal Education Program, 
which pairs unrelated classes to highlight possible similarities. For example, 
the college offers programs linking sociology with 19th-Century literature, 
Spanish with physical education and biology with ethics in religion. 
</P>
<P>
Some students said they were drawn to Whittier College because of its small 
size, its growing academic reputation and financial aid packages that made the 
school more affordable than some state university systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have stayed in Utah" and attended the state university system, said 
senior Holly Tuckett of Salt Lake City. She said she "practically got a free 
ride" through a Whittier College financial aid package based on need. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Good Package' 
</P>
<P>
"They gave me a real good package," said Tuckett, who works part time with 
severely handicapped children. "I figured, 'What the heck, I can get a quality 
education from a private college . . . or go to a state school with 300 
students in one class.' " 
</P>
<P>
When she graduates in six months, she will begin paying back about $4,000 in 
federal and Whittier College loans accumulated over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Other students agreed that Whittier College was the best option for them. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have gone to City College," said sophomore Michael Harris of Los 
Angeles. "If it wasn't for Whittier, I wouldn't be able to afford this 
education. It's pretty decent here." 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a starting cornerback on the football team, said a financial aid 
package of $14,000 has covered virtually everything but $1,000 a year in 
dormitory fees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Minorities 
</P>
<P>
College officials said that recruiters have concentrated on bringing talented 
minority students to Whittier College. Almost 40% of Whittier College students 
are minority or foreign-born, according to financial aid office figures. About 
90% of those who receive financial aid are minority students. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, a Times survey showed that Whittier College has a higher percentage of 
full-time undergraduate Latino students than any comparable small private 
college in Southern California. College officials said that they have remained 
committed to enrolling a high percentage of Latino students. 
</P>
<P>
Miguel Santana, a sophomore from Bell Gardens, said that one of his Bell 
Gardens High teachers, a Whittier College alumnus, encouraged him to apply to 
the 4-year college rather than to a community college. The first of his family 
to continue his education after high school, Santana said that his family was 
not prepared to pay for any college. 
</P>

After interviewing at Whittier, Santana said he became excited about the 
college. Now he wants to go on to graduate school and study political science. 
"I want to bring something back to my community," Santana said. "I didn't

INTERIM POLICE CHIEF NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Anaheim Police Chief Jimmie Kennedy will take over next week as interim 
chief of the Claremont Police Department, City Manager Glenn Southard has 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, who retired as police chief in Anaheim in 1987 after 30 years on the 
force, will oversee the Claremont Police Department until the city hires a 
permanent replacement for Dexter Atkinson, who resigned last month. Last year, 
Kennedy served a 6-month stint as interim police chief of Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson had been on paid administrative leave since August, pending the 
outcome of investigations by the city and the district attorney's office. He 
resigned Dec. 6 after reaching a settlement with the city that included a 
$60,000 severence payment. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lawrence Mason found insufficient evidence to prosecute 
Atkinson. Southard did not disclose the findings of the city's investigation, 
which focused on the police chief's administration of the department. 
</P>
<P>
The city has begun a nationwide search for a permanent police chief, who will 
be chosen within the next six months, Southard said.

CAR DEALER GETS DELAY IN MEETING SIGN LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Downey City Council has approved a zoning variance allowing Paramount 
Chevrolet to retain three of its pole signs until June, 1990. The 18-month 
period will allow the car dealership time to comply with the city's zoning 
ordinance for store advertisements enacted under the city's redevelopment 
program. The current signs violate size and height restrictions. The 
dealership, located at Paramount and Firestone boulevards, has been in Downey 
for nearly 50 years.

Live entertainment and sports demonstrations will highlight the daylong 
dedication and opening Saturday of the newly expanded portion of Liberty Park 
in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
An enclosed group picnic area with a seating capacity of 350, as well as a 
stage, barbecues and sinks, is included in the expansion. There is also an 
overnight camping area for city youth groups and an amphitheater where the 
city's summer concert series will be held. 
</P>
<P>
New racquetball courts in the park feature hardwood maple floors and a 
wall-panel system designed to maximize the speed of play. Cerritos residents 
can rent a court for $5 an hour. Non-residents must pay $8 an hour. There are 
also new tennis and basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the park, which cost $2.7 million, brings its total size to 28.6 
acres. Located along Studebaker Road between South Street and Del Amo

RENTAL INSPECTION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Tuesday gave final approval to a program aimed at cleaning 
up Azusa's rental housing stock, including annual inspections of all rental 
units. 
</P>
<P>
The program will require an $80,000 investment by the city, which will hire two 
inspectors. There are about 6,500 rental units within Azusa, more than half of 
the city's total housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
Each landlord will pay a $30 annual registration fee for each rental complex, 
and an additional $2 for each unit within the complex. Utility connections will 
be withheld until the fees are paid, and landlords whose units are substandard 
will pay fines, eventually making the program self-supporting, according to 
city staff. 
</P>
<P>
Another ordinance setting maintenance guidelines for property owners was sent 
back to city staff for revision because of concerns that landscaping provisions 
were too broad.

CONSULTANT TO STUDY L.B. POLICE STAFFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Staffing at the Long Beach Police Department will be reviewed by an independent 
consultant hired by the city to evaluate whether members of the police force 
could be more efficiently used. 
</P>
<P>
The study, approved this week by the City Council, is intended to answer 
questions raised during debate over a proposed city tax to pay for more police. 
The special tax would have to be approved by Long Beach voters, who have 
questioned whether the department is using its work force to the best 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the study amid some discussion of its impartiality, since 
the police chief will have a hand in outlining the evaluation.

LAW ON ALCOHOL SALES AT GAS STATIONS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Pico Rivera City Council has approved an ordinance under which alcohol can 
be sold at service stations if the business obtains a special city permit. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the council banned alcohol sales at all service stations. But last 
year, the Legislature passed a law making such blanket bans illegal, so the 
City Council complied with the state's action through the ordinance allowing 
alcohol sales only with a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
Even under the city permit, issued with the approval of the Planning 
Commission, alcohol sales would be restricted. Alcohol display and sale areas 
would be limited, the percentage of alcohol sales could not exceed the sales of 
non-alcohol products and the hours of alcohol sales would be limited.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: COUNTY;

<P>
DEVELOPMENT PLAN OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to strongly oppose a pending Los 
Angeles development plan that would block the use of three Westside canyons as 
a regional landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The board, on a 3-1 vote, directed its staff to argue at City Council hearings 
against a provision in the proposed Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan 
that prohibits development of Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons for garbage 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
The directive appears contrary to positions taken last May by three of the five 
supervisors -- Deane Dana, Mike Antonovich and Ed Edelman. They either opposed 
a landfill in the canyons or said they would consider it only as a last resort 
to solve long-range garbage disposal problems. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Edelman cast the dissenting vote, saying that Los Angeles, which 
would have to approve the landfill, has consistently opposed it. "To ask the 
city to permit a landfill there . . . seems a waste of time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dana would say only that his opposition to the landfill has not changed, but 
that his vote figures into behind-the-scenes negotiations between the county 
and the city over where new landfills will be placed. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations said the supervisors want to keep the 
possibility of using the canyons as a landfill alive as a bargaining chip with 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The canyon area is one of six locations that sanitation experts say are 
technically best suited to be garbage dumps. Four of the others are on the 
northern rim of the San Fernando Valley or near Santa Clarita. The fifth is in 
Griffith Park.

POLL ON TAXES FOR SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Searching for ways to solve the school district's financial problems, a 
22-member citizens panel this month will conduct a poll of residents about 
their attitudes regarding new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The Financial Strategy Planning Committee will employ the firm of Fairbank, 
Bregman &amp; Maullin, with offices in Santa Monica and San Francisco, to 
conduct the telephone survey, which will be paid for from private fund-raising 
activities, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-school district, which recently agreed to a 10% raise in teachers' 
salaries, was forced to eliminate $750,000 in budget items to close a budget 
gap for the school year. Greater budget shortfalls are expected next year. The 
panel, which was established last month by the school board, has discussed 
asking voters for a special parcel tax to increase the school budget. It has 
also reportedly considered a bond issue for capital expenses, which would 
require voter approval.

2-YEAR POLICE CONTRACT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city and the San Marino Police Officers Assn. have approved a 2-year salary 
and benefit contract after six months of negotiations that reached an impasse 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
The new contract will give police personnel a 4% raise beginning Jan. 1, and a 
6% raise on Jan. 1, 1990. Each officer also will receive $500 to compensate for 
six months without a raise since the last contract ended in June and will 
receive an increase in medical insurance benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-month impasse with police was the first in the city's history. In the 
last month, the Police Officers Assn. bought full-page advertisements in San 
Marino's weekly newspaper, seeking public support for increased salaries.

NEIGHBORS TO HONOR TEEN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The neighbors of Charles Collins, a 16-year-old who helped extinguish a rooftop 
fire during December's high winds, plan to present him a plaque in honor of his 
courage. 
</P>
<P>
About 2:30 p.m. Dec. 7, Collins noticed that the wind had caused some power 
lines to snap, setting trees on fire and causing a fire on the roof of Roger 
and Becky Tschirgi's home. The Tschirgis were not home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, along with neighbor William Capp, watered down hot spots on the roof 
for about half an hour. County fire crews arrived about 10 minutes later. 
Although the roof had to be replaced, the house escaped major damage. No date 
has been set for the ceremony honoring Collins.

BACKGROUND ON THE AZUSA ROCK QUARRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the benefit of the citizens of Azusa, we wish to clarify some information 
on matters relating to the rock quarry on the hillside (Azusa Rock Inc.). 
</P>
<P>
First, in March of 1987, the City Council requested staff to review the Azusa 
Rock quarrying situation. In March of 1988, the council directed the Planning 
Commission to also review this matter. After hearing numerous hours of public 
testimony and reviewing many documents over several months time, the City 
Council elected to proceed with mitigation instead of a long and expensive 
court fight. The decision to proceed with mitigation resulted from the City 
Council's invitation to all three groups involved to sit at the bargaining 
table and discuss resolving the problem. During the process, two of the groups 
elected to actively participate, while one decided to only monitor the 
sessions. Thus, the new resolution represents a culmination of efforts among 
the cities of Azusa and Duarte, and Azusa Rock Inc. As a result of the group's 
effort, we strongly believe that the adopted mitigation measures place more 
stringent requirements upon the Azusa Rock quarry operation. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the new resolution specifically indicates that the original conditions 
under the 1956 special use permit shall remain in full force and effect. Hence, 
combining the original permit and the new resolution strengthens and enhances 
the conditions imposed by the original conditional use permit. This provides 
the city with greater control and leverage in order to enforce compliance by 
Azusa Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The new restrictions include reviewing the Azusa Rock Quarry special use permit 
every two years to monitor compliance (the Planning Commission will conduct 
public hearings). Additional restrictions to be met by the quarry include 
reduced hours and days of operation, the rerouting of truck traffic away from 
residential areas, revegetation of the hillside, and improved dust control 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
Third, the passage of the new resolution raised some concerns regarding the 
city's power of revocation and the implementation of environmental reviews. In 
the event of noncompliance by Azusa Rock, the Azusa City Council may elect to 
revoke the special use permit. Moreover, with respect to the environmental 
reviews, the city would like to assure the community that environmental studies 
will be conducted when necessary. Specifically, an environmental assessment 
will be required before rock is transported across the San Gabriel River. 
</P>
<P>
In closing, being an elected official sometimes requires making unpopular 
choices. We must often stand alone in exercising the leadership that is so 
essential in hearing all sides of an issue in order to make the proper 
decision. We, as City Council members are aware that there are some people who 
do not agree with our position in this matter; but we would like the record to 
show that after a thorough review of the relevant information and after 
assessing the positive and negative aspects of this situation and how it would 
effect Azusa, we firmly believe that our decision was in the best interest of 
the community at large.

COUNCIL IN OJAI PROMOTES DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS TO POST OF CITY MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rejecting the idea of a job search for a new city manager, the Ojai City 
Council on Tuesday promoted Public Works Director Andrew Belknap into the 
position that Geoffrey Grote will vacate Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap, who also serves as assistant city manager, was named to the city 
manager's post because of his "outstanding performance" over the last 2 years 
and because his knowledge of existing programs will make the transition 
smoother, said Grote, who has resigned for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Belknap, who will receive about $60,000 a year, including a car allowance, will 
run the day-to-day administrative affairs of Ojai. He said he wants to 
streamline budget procedures, restore the downtown arcade facade and develop a 
long-term vision for Ojai with the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
A former public works management analyst for the city of Oxnard, Belknap holds 
bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Grote praised the council's decision to promote a staff member because "it 
makes for a much smoother transition and it makes a great of sense 
organizationally." 
</P>
<P>
Ojai employs about 25 city staff members, Belknap said, which prompted the 
decision to appoint from within. "They want to maintain some continuity in the 
things we are working on here. In a small city like Ojai, when you have a 
vacancy, it really has a dramatic effect on the work output."

FLIGHTS TO LAS VEGAS FROM OXNARD TO BEGIN ON FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Weekend flights from Oxnard Airport to Las Vegas are scheduled to begin Friday, 
despite announcements that Dec. 31 would be the start-up date for the air 
shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Sundance Air, a Denver-based airline, tried to begin nonstop service on New 
Year's Eve, but heavy holiday crowds in Las Vegas made it impossible to meet 
passengers' requests for hotel rooms, company spokesman Dave Cimo said. 
</P>
<P>
The airline works with a Las Vegas tour company, America Pacific Tour &amp; 
Leisure, to secure rooms for its passengers. However, even the rooms usually 
reserved for airline personnel were filled during the weekend, said John 
Schoumaker, president of America Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The route's maiden run will leave Oxnard at 9 p.m. Friday and arrive in Las 
Vegas at 10:20 p.m. The flight returns to Oxnard at 5:20 p.m. Sunday. 
Round-trip fare is $187. 
</P>
<P>
Schoumaker said he had thought that Las Vegas flights from Burbank would 
diminish the Oxnard flight's appeal. But the traffic between Oxnard and Burbank 
was enough to create a separate market of residents of Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sundance will add more flights to the Oxnard-Las Vegas schedule only after 
demand is apparent, said Sundance President Bert Van Toornburg, who is aware of 
the failure of other airlines at Oxnard Airport. "We want to keep a low profile 
at the beginning," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two commuter flights offer shuttle service between Oxnard and Los Angeles 
International Airport. A third commercial airline failed a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sundance specializes in package delivery for such companies as United Parcel 
Service, Van Toornburg said.

COMPTON YOUTHS FLY THROUGH THEIR ROUTINES AND WALK AWAY WITH PRIZES

The Ebony Flyers know how to please a crowd. They crank up the rap music, march 
out on stage in their maroon leotards and sequined silver belts and leap into 
action. 
</P>
<P>
At times moving with the lyric grace of a school of dolphins rising from the 
sea, the 15 Compton youngsters jump, spin and somersault their way across a row 
of tumbling mats to the driving beats of soul, pop and rap songs. 
</P>
<P>
"When they go places and nobody has ever seen them before, the reaction is 
something to watch," Roosevelt Porter, the group's founder and coach, said with 
a touch of pride. 
</P>
<P>
In its 12 years of existence, the acrobatic gymnastics troupe has competed in 
20 amateur performing arts contests, never taking less than first place. 
"They're very skillful and extremely entertaining," observed Victor Dru, a 
Hollywood dance teacher who has organized several regional contests in which 
the Flyers have appeared. 
</P>
<P>
An athletic trainer and gymnastics coach at Compton Community College, Porter 
is a calm, self-assured, 44-year-old who started the troupe under the umbrella 
of the college's community outreach program for children, College for Kids. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keeps Them Off Streets' 
</P>
<P>
In a city of gang shootings and entrenched poverty, Porter gives his charges 
patience, discipline and attention. "It helps the kids," said Deborah Ford, 
whose 8-year-old daughter Shavonda Maxwell has trained with Porter since she 
was 4. "It keeps them off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
Competing against -- and beating -- groups from much more affluent backgrounds 
allows the Flyers to "see the other side of what life is all about," said 
Porter, who graduated from the college in 1976 with an associate of arts 
degree, intending to become an art teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, 'Oh, your kids are from Compton,' and then they roll their eyes," 
he added, smiling because his Compton youths walk away with the prizes. "I have 
something to offer them that they like to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plans on Olympics 
</P>
<P>
Shavonda, who recently won a first place in Las Vegas for a solo routine, 
started with Porter after watching a film about a gymnastics star. "She started 
flipping all over my house. I decided to put her in class before she broke 
something," Ford said. "She loves it, says she's going to the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, Porter works with about 30 youngsters in the program. He runs a 
baby tumbling group of 4- to 6-year-olds and a beginning group of slightly 
older children preparing for the Flyers, boys and girls ranging in age from 7 
to 26. 
</P>
<P>
Twice a week the Flyers gather in the college gymnasium for two hours of 
practice. They don't use parallel bars or beams in their act, concentrating 
instead on mat routines involving tumbling feats. 
</P>
<P>
They execute their moves serially or in unison, often creating a dance-like 
effect. "Everybody who works with this group has to understand they're part of 
a machine," said Porter, who competed in gymnastics as a Los Angeles high 
school student and who choreographs the troupe's routines. 
</P>
<P>
Although an arts major, Porter worked in the college training room to earn 
money while attending Compton, "and it just sort of took hold." He became 
certified as an athletic trainer and has held that position at the college 
since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
He also worked with the College for Kids program while a student. When the 
directors wanted a new course one summer, Porter fell back on his gymnast 
training to start a tumbling class. He used music to help the beginners master 
their timing, incorporating it into the end-of-course performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Parents Went Wild' 
</P>
<P>
"The parents went wild, so I just kept it up, year after year." 
</P>
<P>
Originally all girls, the group was first called the Ebony Jewels. 
</P>
<P>
Several alumnae of the Flyers have gone on to study dance in college, while 
four former members of the troupe who organized their own singing group -- The 
Boys -- recently climbed to the top of the soul charts with their song, "Dial 
My Heart." The four boys sang at the same performing arts competitions in which 
they appeared with the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately Porter says he would like to help Compton youngsters compete at the 
national or even international level. To that end, he is hoping to persuade the 
college and the city to find the facilities to house a full-fledged, community 
gymnastics program. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he dreams up new routines. "I don't want the kids to ever 
think we're doing the same thing. That's boredom."

SKATEBOARDER FINDS BASKETBALL BEARINGS

Paul Matijasevic didn't fit the bill as a skate rat. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 feet, 5 inches, Matijasevic towered over his boarding buddies. His 
skateboard resembled an emery board under his size-15 sneakers. He didn't even 
like the pounding, discordant strains of the "thrash rock" that pulsed from his 
friends' oversized boom boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one glance at Matijasevic's freshman report card at Crescenta Valley 
High proved that he was spending far more time cruising the La Crescenta 
pavement than pounding the books. 
</P>
<P>
"After school I would just take the board and go," said Matijasevic, who posted 
a 1.0 grade-point average his first semester. "My parents would ground me and 
take my board away but I would end up buying a new one. It was a big quarrel." 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic's favorite game was to lie supine on his board and barrel down a 
steep street in a position aptly dubbed "the coffin." Two years ago, he says, a 
friend followed in a car and proudly informed him that the 6-5 inch missile was 
traveling at 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
One neighbor, John Goffredo, saw more than a gangly, apathetic kid in 
Matijasevic. Goffredo, boys' basketball coach at Crescenta Valley, saw a 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Matijasevic is 2 inches taller and his grade-point average is 2 full 
points higher. The junior laughs about the times when his distaste for school 
was rivaled only by his disdain for a haircut. 
</P>
<P>
And although Matijasevic's skills on the hardwood are not as practiced as his 
moves on a plywood skateboard, he has earned a position as a starting forward 
for the Falcon varsity. He averages 11 points and 10 rebounds a game and 
recently was named to the all-tournament team at the Eldorado tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball, however, was not an instant panacea for Matijasevic. In fact, he 
almost quit his freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't care for the discipline," Goffredo said. "Now he realizes the end 
product. Nobody likes to be yelled at, chewed on or pushed, but he 
understands." 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic, who stood 6-4 as a seventh-grader, was lumbering up a hill -- 
skateboard in hand -- when he had his first encounter with Goffredo. The coach 
asked him if he spent much time on the court, or was planning to do so. In an 
attempt to stave off Goffredo's interest, Matijasevic said that he planned to 
attend St. Francis High and did not intend to play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The coach did not push the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to hook him first," he said. "I had to get him to like the 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic said that he enrolled at Crescenta Valley because his grades were 
too low for St. Francis. Matijasevic cannot pinpoint a reason why, but he 
decided to try out for the Falcons' summer league team. 
</P>
<P>
Goffredo was eager to get Matijasevic on his varsity squad, but he knew the 
youngster would need time to develop into an impact player. 
</P>
<P>
He was right. Matijasevic wallowed through his freshman season with the zeal of 
a garden slug. He played his sophomore year, too, with minimal emotion and 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic says that his laziness was attributable to the size disparity 
between himself and smaller players. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like such a dominator," he said. But true domination was a long way 
off. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, however, expecting to be bumped up to varsity, he approached the 
sport with a new dedication. He got up at 6 each weekday morning and worked out 
alone at the school gym. 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic was still second string when Crescenta Valley played South Pasadena 
in a summer league game. Goffredo started the second unit and promised not to 
pull the players unless they were overwhelmed. The second stringers did not 
falter and Matijasevic has been a starter ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Matijasevic has not climbed into the coffin lately, but he hasn't renounced his 
wild past, either. In fact, he says the coordination he developed skateboarding 
has benefitted him on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to do tricks like flipping the board up and grabbing it -- little 
nicky-nacky tricks -- but it really helped," Matijasevic said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Matijasevic is hoping to help Crescenta Valley contend for a league 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to have long hair and hide behind it and now he's got something to 
offer," Goffredo said. "The kid did a 180 (degree turn) because of basketball 
and I'm proud of that." 
</P>

HOME USED FOR NEGLECTED CHILDREN PROPOSED AS HISTORIC MONUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles city Cultural Heritage Commission recommended Wednesday that an 
83-year-old Craftsman-style home in Highland Park be declared a 
historic-cultural monument, alleviating concern over its future. 
</P>
<P>
The concern arose when a program for abused children that operated out of the 
home closed last year after 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
The home, built with river-bed boulders, was designed by Los Angeles architect 
Robert Edmund Williams. It includes a stained-glass window by the Judson 
Studios of Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1948, the estate had been operated by the Hathaway Home for Children, a 
program for abused and neglected children run by Hathaway Children's Services, 
a private, nonprofit child welfare agency that also owns the property. In 
September, the agency closed the home and transferred the remaining youths, 
ages 6 to 13, to its headquarters in Little Tujunga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
The commission recommended that only the house be designated a 
historic-cultural monument, excluding 2 acres of grounds and dorms. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Cahill, Hathaway Children's Services president, said the agency intends 
to keep the home for use as a community service center. He said the agency's 
board is considering selling the balance of the 2.8-acre site for development 
of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's recommendation requires approval of the City Council. If the 
council grants the historic-cultural status, any proposed changes to the site 
would require approval by the commission.

LA CANADA TO KEEP DIAL-A-RIDE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The La Canada Flintridge City Council unanimously agreed this week to continue 
the city's 2-year-old Dial-a-Ride program. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, funded by the city and operated in conjunction with 
Glendale, the city rents two specially equipped buses that provide handicapped 
and elderly residents with free transportation to La Crescenta, Montrose, 
Glendale, Pasadena and Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
Through September, the program provided an average of 423 rides per month and 
cost the city $109,149, said Administrative Assistant Mark Alexander, who 
oversees the program for La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander said ridership has increased 186% since service began in 1986, making 
the program more cost-efficient. According to Alexander, each ride costs the 
city an average of $25, down from $66 during the program's first year.

WINNING IS NICE BUT . . .;

COACH OF UNDEFEATED CONQUERORS THINKS A PRESEASON DEFEAT OR TWO MIGHT DO GIRLS 
GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It is not as if Don Holbrook, coach of the Los Altos High girls basketball 
team, has anything against winning. 
</P>
<P>
After watching his team reach the CIF Southern Section 3-A Division 
championship game and the state playoffs last season, Holbrook says he is happy 
to see the Conquerors out to a fast start with an 11-0 record -- best in the 
San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the undefeated aspect of the team's record that has the coach 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that scares me is that we haven't lost," Holbrook said. "I 
think you need to lose to gain a perspective." 
</P>
<P>
While Holbrook is hardly going to give any of the wins back, he says there is 
something to be gained from a well-placed loss or two on a team's early season 
record. 
</P>
<P>
"I really believe that as a coach in preseason you like to lose a couple of 
games in order to get the full attention of your players," Holbrook said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where you gain your experience. You can coach a lot more from a loss 
than a win." 
</P>
<P>
The coach remembers the fate of the Edgewood High girls, who won their first 24 
games only to lose in the second round of the CIF playoffs last season. "I 
don't know what their situation was," he said, "but you would hope we could 
avoid having that kind of thing happen." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Los Altos was 20-4 last season and has three starters 
returning, the early success of the Conquerors is not altogether surprising. 
Los Altos was ranked No. 3 -- behind Palos Verdes and Muir -- in the preseason 
CIF 4-A poll. 
</P>
<P>
Only Holbrook said he had his questions about the Conquerors at the start of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we'd be decent because we had some good players back, but we still 
had some holes to fill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most important were at the wing positions where Los Altos lost both of its 
starters from last season, including guard Susan Susseov, second-team All-CIF 
3-A selection as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the Conquerors have found ample replacements in senior Noreen 
Fukute (5-6) and sophomore Natasha Susseov (5-6), Susan's sister. The coach 
said the younger Susseov has made good progress. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't shoot real well yet," he said, "but she's aggressive and that's 
what we need." 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook was also concerned about the team's ball handling and outside shooting 
at the start of the season and said he has seen improvement in both 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
"We've come along in those two areas and we've always had the defense," he 
said. "We're not blowing people away, but if you look at our scores you can see 
we're holding people to about 40 points, which is what we need to do to be 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Not to mention the play of the returning starters, which has been as steady as 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
Leading the way is 5-11 senior Susan Peters, who averaged 25.4 points and 12 
rebounds and was a first-team All-CIF 3-A selection last season. Holbrook said 
Peters may have started the season a little slowly after playing for the Los 
Altos volleyball team, where she earned All-CIF honors as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
She also had to adjust to being more of a center of attention for Conqueror 
opponents this season. "The big thing teams are doing is doubling up on her to 
try to stop her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Peters has been having more success lately in improving her average 
to 22.6 points -- including 36 points against Boulder City of Nevada in the 
consolation final of the Chino tournament in the team's last game in December 
-- and 12.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been concentrating on volleyball," Holbrook said. "That's her sport. But 
she's beginning to play to her level now." 
</P>
<P>
The other returning starters are 5-11 senior Jonna Steffens, who teams with 
Peters in the twin-post offense, and point guard Staci Louie (5-4). Steffens is 
averaging 10.5 points and 9.9 rebounds, and Louie, the floor leader, is leading 
in assists at 4.6. 
</P>
<P>
The coach said Louie has been the biggest surprise. "She's really stepped in 
and turned it on for us. The big thing is she doesn't make many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
With no starter taller than 5-11, the Conquerors are not the biggest team in 
the valley. However, Holbrook said his biggest concern has been the team's 
outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had better shooters, I'd be a little happier right now," he said. "We're 
doing things to compensate for it, but I wish we didn't have to." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Holbrook has to be happy with the results that his team has produced. 
The Conquerors opened the season by winning the Wilson and St. Lucy's 
tournaments before settling for the consolation title at Chino. 
</P>
<P>
Los Altos may have been in position for three tournament titles if not for a 
scheduling error that forced the Conquerors to send their junior varsity into 
the first round of the Chino tournament. The Conquerors were playing in the 
final of the St. Lucy's tournament and, under Southern Section rules, a team 
cannot play in two tournaments in the same day. 
</P>
<P>
That has allowed the Conquerors to keep their perfect record intact, although 
Holbrook said his team's record does not necessarily mean Los Altos is stronger 
than it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we're as good as last year's team but we're finally playing at 
the level that I think we can," he said. "As a group we feel like we're not as 
talented, but we're more efficient in getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
So while Holbrook says he is happy with the team's success, he is not about to 
get carried away. Not with a difficult Sierra League season. 
</P>
<P>
"These early games are preseason games," he said, "win or lose, they're not 
that important except that we have to get up to a certain level." 
</P>
<P>
The coach said it is more important for his team to show what it can do later 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to win our league title and go far in the CIF (playoffs)," he said. 
"It doesn't matter what our record is."

SPORTSSCOPE: SIZZLING CORSAIR CAGERS TO FACE VALLEY AFTER SANTIAGO TOURNAMENT 
TRIUMPH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Monica College men's basketball team, which completed its 
non-conference schedule with a 15-3 record, will play its second Western State 
Conference game at Los Angeles Valley College at 7 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs will play host to West Los Angeles College in a conference game at 
7 p.m. Monday at Corsair Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Santa Monica cruised to the championship of the Rancho Santiago 
tournament, defeating the host team, 101-77, in the final. In other tourney 
games, the Corsairs routed Mt. San Antonio, 108-54, and Saddleback, 90-54. 
</P>
<P>
SMC's Keith Amerson was named the tournament's most valuable player, and 
teammates Von Shuler and Terry Clark were chosen for the all-tourney squad. 
</P>
<P>
Shuler is averaging 14.7 points a game to lead 6 Corsairs in double figures: 
Kemo Patrick (12.7), Amerson (12.5 and a team-high 9.6 rebounds), DeShawn 
Pullard and Mark Day (11.4 each) and Troy Batiste (10.7). Pullard has posted 
team-high marks with averages of 6.5 assists and 2.3 steals, and Batiste is 
averaging 5.8 assists. 
</P>
<P>
With only six players on the roster, the Santa Monica College women's 
basketball team still managed an 11-4 mark in non-conference play. The Corsairs 
will play their second Western State Conference game at 5 p.m. Saturday at Los 
Angeles Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last week SMC won three of four games and finished third in the Grossmont 
College Tournament in San Diego. In the third-place game, the Lady Corsairs 
defeated Grand Rapids of Michigan, 75-59, despite losing Katarina Nordin, the 
team's second-leading rebounder, because of a back injury. In other tournament 
games, SMC defeated Grossmont, 69-55, and Glendale of Arizona, 69-65. 
</P>
<P>
Corsair Jenise Cooley was named the tournament's most inspirational player, and 
teammate LaVern Moore was named to the all-tourney team. 
</P>
<P>
The UCLA women's basketball team (3-6), coming off a 63-46 home loss to Ohio 
State, will open Pacific 10 Conference play when it plays host to California at 
7 p.m. Friday and ninth-ranked Stanford at 7 p.m. Saturday at John Wooden 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
Molly Tideback, the Bruins' freshman center, continues to impress. She leads 
the team with an average of 12.9 points a game, 10 blocked shots and a 79.2% 
average on free throws. She set a school record by hitting 14 free throws 
against Pepperdine, and her 23 straight foul shots over three games just missed 
tying Denise Curry's UCLA record of 24. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine women's basketball team (5-7 as the week began) will play its 
final non-conference game against UC Irvine at 5 p.m. Tuesday at Irvine's Bren 
Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
At home last week the Waves were routed by Cal State Fullerton but defeated 
Holy Cross, 75-69. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Dionne Burgess is averaging 15.3 points to lead the Waves, and 
senior forward April Marion is averaging 14.4 points and a team-high 9 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Rolfe of Dorsey High School and Crenshaw's Latrel Jackson have been 
invited to compete in the 500-yard run at the Sunkist Invitational, which 
starts at 4:30 p.m. Jan. 20 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
Angela Burnham of Oxnard Rio Mesa High is the girl to beat in the 500. Burnham, 
who competed in last year's Olympic trials, won last year's Sunkist 500 and has 
run 100 meters in 11.28. Rolfe ran a 54.17 400 meters to finish fourth at last 
year's state prep meet, and Jackson has a top mark of 57.37 in the 400.

Names in the News 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lodish, UCLA defensive tackle, was named Southern California lineman of 
the year by Lawry's The Prime Rib. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA Coach Terry Donahue called Lodish, a 6 foot-3 inch, 253-pound junior, "one 
of our best and most consistent defensive players throughout the year, and (he) 
is certainly deserving of this outstanding award." 
</P>
<P>
A native of Birmingham, Mich., Lodish, 21, received honorable mention for the 
All-Pacific 10 Conference team. Against Stanford this season, he knocked the 
football from the quarterback's hand, caught the ball and ran for a 17-yard 
touchdown.

HOCKEY: IT'S ALL IN THE FAMILY; 
</P>
<P>
LINDA GEFFNER COMES TO PLAY -- SHE'S NOT JUST A GIRL IN A BOYS' SPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY RIPTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Geffner is a rare combination: all girl, yet all hockey player. Not field 
hockey, mind you, a sport that convention says is more suitable for females. 
But ice hockey, replete with flashing skate blades, thudding body checks -- and 
mucho machismo. 
</P>
<P>
Geffner, a 16-year-old student at Crossroads School in Santa Monica, has been 
playing ice hockey for boys teams since she was 11. Though she is a native of a 
sunny clime -- and therefore comes by her love of the sport in a somewhat 
unnatural fashion -- she is apparently a natural on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
The Beverlywood resident got her first taste of hockey from her parents, Susan 
and David. 
</P>
<P>
Although her parents were born and raised in Los Angeles, they are die-hard 
hockey fans who used to religiously attend games of the Los Angeles Blades, a 
minor league team that preceded the arrival of the Los Angeles Kings of the 
National Hockey League. When the Kings came to town the Geffners transferred 
their allegiance to them. 
</P>
<P>
Linda saw her first Kings game when she was a half-pint and discovered later 
that she not only loved the game but also wanted to play it. The trouble was 
that the sport in Los Angeles is played by teams composed mostly of boys. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't trouble her, however. 
</P>
<P>
"When I discovered that I really wanted to play, I didn't realize that they 
were boys and I was a girl," she said. "I was just at an age (11) when it 
didn't matter. I didn't figure it was a boys sport, so I went ahead and started 
playing. Now I'm a little older, and it's a little different. 
</P>
<P>
"But then my hair was real short and half the people didn't know I was a girl. 
My parents figured I would outgrow it. They used to whisper, with their hands 
over their mouths, 'Give her a season and she'll get over it.' 
</P>
<P>
"I figured that was it -- I'll show them." 
</P>
<P>
Show them she did, sometimes to their dismay. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom comes to games and is a little bit tentative. But after a while she 
enjoys it. My dad comes to every game." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Geffner confesses that watching Linda's games is not always enjoyable. 
"It's very difficult at this stage to watch her. There are certain kids on 
certain teams who are out to get her, and I get very emotional." 
</P>
<P>
Linda skates for the Marina City Sharks, whose home ice is the Culver Ice Rink. 
This is her second year with the Bantams group, for players 14 through 16 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she has seen other girls play for boys teams but that some tend 
to give up hockey as they get older. Girls who continue are asked to play an 
extra year with their age group, primarily because boys are getting bigger -- 
and rougher. The Pee Wee group, she said, is for those 12 and 13, but she 
played in that age group for three years. 
</P>
<P>
The theory behind the additional year requirement, she said, is that girls 
"won't demolish as easily. But it doesn't matter to me if you're going to get 
hit or give a hit, which I do." 
</P>
<P>
That she does. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Chapman, 14, a goalkeeper and teammate of Linda, said that a boy from an 
opposing team "might check her, but Linda takes it and checks right back." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Chapman, Brian's father, coaches the Marina City Bantams and said that 
Linda is "a good team player." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think she's at a disadvantage just because she's a girl," said the 
elder Chapman, who said he used to play high school hockey in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rough sport, and a lot of kids are physical," he said. "She has bigger 
kids to overcome, and I think that's a real credit to her." 
</P>
<P>
He said that, since she is older than the boys she plays against, they 
sometimes "give her a good shot to shake her up so that she will theoretically 
be ineffective. But she comes back real strong and has made a lot of progress." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chapman estimated that there are about 20 to 30 females in the Southern 
California Hockey Assn.'s age groups, from as young as 5 to as old as 55. 
</P>
<P>
Some might say that these girls and women are risking serious injury by mixing 
it up with boys and men on the ice. But Chapman thinks that amateur hockey is a 
relatively safe sport for all players. 
</P>
<P>
The players, he said, "wear a lot of protective gear, and they rarely take a 
direct hit as in football." 
</P>
<P>
He believes that Linda is safer than some of the other players. "(She) has been 
playing an awful long time, so she has the ability to protect herself. As we 
would say to an enemy on the ice, 'Keep your head up (meaning that the opponent 
better watch out for himself).' 
</P>
<P>
"She is a good player because she has skating ability, strength and because of 
her teamwork." 
</P>
<P>
She has had a couple of minor injuries but seems to have dismissed them with a 
shake of her ponytail, the hairdo she wears when she plays these days. She 
wears her hair that way so the boys can see that she's a girl. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, she said, she had a muscle tear in her right shoulder when a 
player slammed her into the boards. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to wear a sling and was supposed to wear it for three weeks. But I got 
so tired of it that I just took it off after about a week. Sometimes I wake up 
and I can feel it (pain in her shoulder)." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she acquired "kind of a knee injury" when she was doing a drill 
in hockey camp three years ago. Players had to drop to their knees on the ice, 
and her protective pad slipped and she smacked her knee against the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"Every now and then it hurts," she said. She has a knee brace for it, "which I 
don't wear." The injuries haven't discouraged her from playing, and she wants 
to play intercollegiate hockey for Harvard's women's team. She goes to summer 
hockey camps in Montreal for instruction from professional players. She is at 
the Culver rink at least five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I practice after a game once or twice a week," she said. "I put in a little 
extra time because (the games) don't give you enough time to stay in shape. You 
have to work out on your 
</P>
<P>
own. I skate without my equipment; you can't play if you can't skate." 
</P>
<P>
She takes skating lessons from Gary Visconti, who finished fifth in figure 
skating in the 1968 Winter Olympics at Grenoble, France. 
</P>
<P>
"He works me hard," she said, putting her through drills for "agility, 
stroking, digging into the ice to make you go faster. He works me in 
everything. It just makes your game better by improving your skating." 
</P>
<P>
And Linda's game is very good, and she also takes to coaching, Coach Chapman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She has a good set of goals in mind, and she will probably get them. I like 
that in a player; it makes them easier to coach. I know she listens to me and 
that she'll do (what he asks)." 
</P>
<P>
But in competing with boys, he said, Linda does face difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"Her biggest problem -- and I don't care how long she's been skating or how 
skilled she is -- is that there is a certain intimidation factor from large 
boys. (She is 5 foot 5 inches and weighs 120 pounds but doesn't look that 
heavy.) And she has to deal with that. 
</P>
<P>
"As a team player, you've got to maintain your intensity level -- but you also 
have to stay alive. That's always at the back of your mind. No matter how 
courageous you are, that tends to be a factor in how you perform." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, he said, is that "it is hard for a girl to have good 
upper-body strength, so her shot is not as hard as (that of) a boy her age. She 
tends to have a disadvantage in shooting, but she makes up for that by being a 
good assist player. 
</P>
<P>
"You can always find someone who can shoot the puck but not someone with the 
ability to skate and pass." 
</P>
<P>
Linda has those hard-to-find talents, he said, and she has not surrendered any 
of her femininity to acquire them. "She still has a very ladylike quality off 
the ice. She's not the tomboy type at all." 
</P>
<P>
She concedes that she is sometimes less than ladylike on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone gets on me, I have a lightning temper, and I know when to hit 
somebody: when the referee is not looking. Of course, when you get hit, you try 
to make sure the referee is looking. That way you get a penalty (on the other 
player)." 
</P>
<P>
She also uses another kind of weapon at times. "I have a big mouth," she said, 
"and I kind of use it." 
</P>
<P>
She said she may not like women's intercollegiate hockey as much as going 
against boys because "there is no hitting and it's a lot different. But hey, 
you never know until you try it." 
</P>
<P>
Carl Chapman said he thinks that she will "adapt real well" to the women's game 
and will be "a mile ahead of someone who hasn't played in a boys league." Brian 
Chapman, her goalie teammate, said he thinks that she can "handle herself" on 
the ice with the Sharks and can "take the roughness." 
</P>
<P>
"But if she was in trouble," he said, "if someone tried to pick on her or she 
got into a fight, I would help her out. 
</P>
<P>
"I consider her part of the team and one of the guys. She's a pretty good 
hockey player -- and she's nice too." 
</P>
<P>
Absolutely, Brian.

FISHING / DAN STANTON;

<P>
MUSEUM DIRECTOR CATCHES ONLY ONE FISH BUT IT'S A REAL BEAUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN STANTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What does a director for the Cabrillo Museum do on his day off? He goes fishing 
for exotics for the museum aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Sukuhara of San Pedro went fishing recently on the half-day boat Matt 
Walsh from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing, as he often does. 
</P>
<P>
With a light rain and calm seas, the Matt Walsh headed to White's Point and 
before the anchor had taken hold the bass boiled on the chum line. 
</P>
<P>
Sukuhara found a squid in the bait tank, hooked it on his leader with a 4-ounce 
sinker and 20-pound test line and went down to the bottom fishing for halibut. 
</P>
<P>
After several minutes, he said, his bait was being hit. He thought it acted 
like a halibut moving slowly on the bottom. In a few minutes he set the hook 
and reeled in slowly. The fish did not offer much fight until it came close to 
the surface, and Sukuhara knew this was no ordinary catch -- but a rare exotic. 
It was put aboard in a net, Sukuhara carefully removed the hook and put the 
unidentified fish into the bait tank. 
</P>
<P>
The fish had a mixture of brown, red and black coloring and big blue eyes. All 
the anglers aboard had a look and tried to guess what it was. 
</P>
<P>
The fish was transported in a container and put in one of the museum's holding 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Sukuhara and his staff failed to identify the prize catch immediately. Chief 
aquarist Lloyd Ellis was called and he gave it a positive ID -- a gulf coney 
that normally ranges from the Gulf of California to Peru. 
</P>
<P>
The fish is on display in a tank at the Cabrillo Museum. 
</P>
<P>
This is one fish that won't be served on a dinner plate. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Catches: 
</P>
<P>
Guy Shonweier of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Sharpshooter at Twin Roads 
with live squid and a halibut rig, caught the whopper of the week, a 
26-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
Howard Reyes of Torrance, aboard the Redondo Special at Rocky Point, won the 
jackpot with his 23-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Perez of San Pedro, on the Southern Cal at Catalina Island in 600 feet of 
water, brought to gaff a 19 1/2-pound lingcod. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mendoza of Harbor City, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the drop-off 
area in 300 feet of water, landed two fish on his cod rig, a 16 1/2-pound cow 
cod and an 11-pound sheepshead. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Reports: 
</P>
<P>
The weather failed to halt boats that carried anglers in rain gear. 
</P>
<P>
Despite showers and light wind, they caught halibut in Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina rock cod trips produced near limits when boats could cross the 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
On local shallow rock cod and surface trips, most of the catch has been bass 
and sculpin.

BORDEN FORGES 'SUICIDE PACT' AS TAKEOVER SHIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The top 25 executives of consumer products giant Borden Inc., in something akin 
to a corporate suicide pact, said Wednesday that they have forged an 
anti-takeover plan that calls for all of them to quit the company if any one of 
them is fired after an unfair corporate takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Borden chief executive Romeo J. Ventres, calling the defense a "people pill," 
in contrast to the widely used "poison pills," said that any bidder who tries 
to take over Borden at a low-ball price would face an executive suite exodus 
that could cripple the firm overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were an acquirer, I'd think twice about . . . risking the total loss of 
this operating management," said Ventres, whose company produces Borden dairy 
products, Laura Scudder's potato chips and other snacks, Cracker Jack candy, 
Elmer's glue and dozens of other brands. "And, if I were a lender, I'd think 
twice about lending to somebody willing to take such a risk." 
</P>
<P>
In return for signing contracts pledging that they would join the pact, these 
top executives would get additional cash in their severance packages, called 
"golden parachutes," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Firms Change Hands 
</P>
<P>
The pact is a sign of the anxiety many corporate executives feel today, 
particularly in the consumer products industries, as the unabating takeover 
wave has engulfed company after company. As corporate chieftains and Wall 
Street buyout specialists have bid higher and higher for the values they see in 
brand-named products, such leading U.S. corporations as RJR Nabisco Corp., 
Pillsbury Co., Kraft Inc. and Beatrice Co. have changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
And, recently, there has been new evidence of how difficult it is to defend a 
company against a determined bidder who is willing to pay mostly cash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Poison Pill' Rejected 
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks ago, the Delaware Supreme Court threw out Pillsbury's attempt to 
block an offer from Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British conglomerate, with one of 
the "poison pill" devices, which seek to block unsolicited takeovers by making 
them prohibitively expensive. Grand Met is now completing the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"Some managements are feeling pretty hemmed in these days, as this desperate 
gesture shows," said Gregg Jarrell, a finance professor and former chief 
economist for the Securities and Exchange Commission. "This one says: 'We're in 
the trenches, boys -- fix bayonets.' " 
</P>
<P>
Borden executives insisted that the company, which had 1987 sales of $6.5 
billion, is not now faced with a takeover threat. But they acknowledged that 
the takeover boom has been very much on their minds. 
</P>
<P>
"We read the papers and watch TV," said Ventres, who struck on the idea while 
sweating in a sauna last March. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said the company's stock is now trading at what many 
consider a depressed level, suggesting that some potential acquirers might 
consider a takeover offer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bloody Takeover Battles 
</P>
<P>
Ventres said the recent history of bloody takeover battles shows that many 
acquirers have won companies by paying the shareholders less than they might 
have. He noted the case of the British conglomerate Hanson Trust PLC, which has 
so far raised $1.3 billion by selling off parts of SCM Corp., which it bought 
in 1986 for $930 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some Wall Street analysts and takeover specialists said they thought that the 
"people pill" might cause some potential buyers to hesitate before making a bid 
or might result in a higher bid to avoid a court fight over some provisions of 
the device. 
</P>
<P>
But several said it would probably prove to be more ingenious than effective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely clever, but, if an acquirer were thinking of just selling off 
the pieces of the company, losing the management might not prove such a 
disadvantage," said Richard Lowe, takeover specialist in Washington with the 
law firm of Proskauer, Rose, Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn. 
</P>
<P>
"The unemployment lines are filled with people who thought they were 
indispensable," said Ralph Whitworth, executive director of the United 
Shareholders Assn., a "shareholder rights" group in Washington, D.C., formed by 
corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrell questioned whether the contracts would hold up in court and whether an 
acquirer might not be able to run the company using the Borden executives 
immediately below the top 25. 
</P>
<P>
Also uncertain, he said, is whether the 25 executives would stand together, in 
a pinch, and actually quit the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Top executives generally step on a lot of people getting where they are," said 
Jarrell, who now teaches at the University of Rochester's William E. Simon 
Business School. "They may not be willing to go quietly." 
</P>
<P>
To put the pact in effect, the executives late last month signed contracts 
committing them to quit if Borden were taken over in what they considered an 
unfairly priced deal. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 executives have for several years had a severance compensation package 
that is collectively worth up to $27 million. The new contracts have increased 
the maximum value of these "golden parachutes" to $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
To deal with the case of an executive who violates the pact by staying on, the 
contracts include a clause that Jarrell called an "exploding reverse golden 
parachute." In such a circumstance, the salary of an executive who did not quit 
would have to be divided equally with the 24 who left. 
</P>
<P>
That would mean that, to pay an executive a $150,000 salary, the acquirer would 
have to shell out $3.75 million, $3.6 million of which would be divided among 
the executive suite "loyalists." 
</P>
<P>
Borden executives said that they thought the pact would be particularly 
effective because the company is highly decentralized, largely consisting of a 
collection of regionally distributed brands run by managers who have been with 
the company for years. The average tenure of the 25 executives is 21 years, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
It would be difficult for an acquirer to replace such people, they insisted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determination of Worth 
</P>
<P>
If a takeover offer were made, the company directors' first step would be to 
try to judge its fairness, based on complicated criteria for judging the 
company's worth. A fair offer, under the new arrangement, would be one that 
took into account 100% of Borden's value as an operating concern, plus 50% of 
the extra value the company might have to some bidder in a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The "people pill" would be defused if the offer at least matched that value. It 
would also be nullified if shareholders seem to be enthusiastic about the 
takeover. Specifically, the anti-takeover plan would be dead if 85% of the 
shares held by disinterested shareholders -- neither management nor the bidder 
-- are tendered. 
</P>
<P>
But the "people pill" would be triggered if those conditions were not met and 
if the new owner demoted or fired a single one of the 25 top executives.

BUSH EXPECTED TO ENDORSE PARENTAL CHOICE OF SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The incoming Administration of President-elect George Bush appears close to 
endorsing an innovative idea in American education that would curb the 
traditional authority of local officials to assign pupils to public schools and 
give parents wide freedom to decide which schools their children would attend. 
</P>
<P>
Some educators believe that widespread implementation of such a program -- 
already adopted in Minnesota -- would transform and improve American education 
radically by forcing public schools to compete against each other for pupils on 
the basis of quality. 
</P>
<P>
The idea, known as "choice," is the most concrete indication thus far of how 
Bush will seek to redeem his campaign pledge to become "the education 
President." It is particularly attractive for a conservative chief executive 
facing a severe budget crunch because embracing choice would be considered a 
bold stroke, yet presumably would involve no federal dollars and require no 
direct federal intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos, who will remain at his post in the 
Bush Administration, has asked prominent educators, state education officials 
and union leaders to meet at the White House next Tuesday to discuss the new 
concept, according to those invited. 
</P>
<P>
The closed session will prepare the way for the secretary's promised 
announcement on Jan. 18, two days before the Bush inauguration, of the new 
Administration's educational program. Most educators expect an endorsement of 
choice to play a prominent part. 
</P>
<P>
"If you wanted to make a difference as President," said John E. Chubb of the 
Brookings Institution, "that is what you would be talking about." 
</P>
<P>
Washington now has no authority to impose the choice system on the local school 
districts which control the nation's public schools. But an endorsement by 
Bush, if made clearly and dramatically, would represent an enormous push behind 
a new idea that is becoming fashionable in many educational circles. 
</P>
<P>
An endorsement would hardly represent a radical departure for Bush. During the 
election campaign, his staff issued an education policy statement which said 
that "George Bush believes parents should be able to choose which public 
schools their children attend." The statement cited the Minnesota experiment 
and a program of choice in East Harlem in New York as noteworthy examples of 
what Bush had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
This support of choice, however, was not an issue and attracted little 
attention during the campaign. 
</P>

See Dramatic Difference 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts like Chubb, who will attend the Tuesday meeting with Cavazos, 
believe that choice may make a dramatic difference in the quality of American 
education. Chubb has just completed a massive study of American high schools 
with Prof. Terry M. Moe of Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
The study's findings demonstrate that the quality of a school makes an enormous 
difference in the educational achievement of children of similar background and 
intelligence, he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The most effective schools, according to Chubb, are those free of control of 
central bureaucracies and unions and run by strong principals who involve 
teachers in decisions. But most large school systems do not allow such schools. 
Competition, he went on, would encourage them. 
</P>
<P>
"Choice," he said, "breaks the monopoly." 
</P>
<P>
Others are more wary of the new idea, though few are openly hostile. Albert 
Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, who also plans to 
attend the meeting with Cavazos, said: "I think choice potentially could be a 
very positive thing. But the idea that it can solve everything is nonsense. For 
years we had many manufacturers making many automobiles in this country and we 
had an awful lot of lemons." 
</P>
<P>
State education officials from Minnesota, where the most widespread experiment 
in the country is being conducted, plan to attend the Tuesday meeting with 
Cavazos. They will surely be questioned closely about what they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Minnesota program, which began this school year, a parent -- within 
some limits -- may enroll a child in any public elementary and high school in 
the state. The state's educational subsidy -- between $2,500 and $4,000 a year 
per pupil -- goes to the school in which the child enrolls. In theory, a poorly 
run school could eventually be depleted of pupils and shut down; a well-run 
school could prosper. 
</P>
<P>
There are limits: Parents must pay for the transportation of a child to the 
boundaries of the new school district. Small schools are exempt this year 
though they take part in the program next year. A school can declare that it is 
too full to accept more pupils. Schools under court desegregation orders must 
retain their racial balances. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of choice, nevertheless, still strikes many educators as daring. 
</P>
<P>
There is some suspicion of choice and of the Minnesota program because, at 
least on the surface, they seem to resemble longtime proposals by far-right 
organizations and others for voucher or tax credit systems that would finance 
the transfer of pupils from public to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Where we begin to be leery," said Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the 
National Education Assn., "is when people start using choice as a euphemism for 
vouchers and tax credits. It could be a way to open the door to use public 
funds to support private schools. Taking the money from public schools does not 
solve the issue. You are depleting the funds for schools that are already in 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota open enrollment system will not subsidize the transfer of a pupil 
from a public to a private school. Moreover, Minnesota, a state with a long 
liberal tradition, is run by Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich who says that he was 
attracted to the idea not out of ideology but out of frustration over his 
inability to transfer his own children when he was a young politician 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Many politicians and educators believe that there is a crisis in American 
education -- with a 25% school dropout rate and perhaps 20 million adult 
illiterates. While a consensus seems to feel that the Bush Administration must 
restore many of the cuts made by the Reagan Administration in the federal 
education budget and expand spending on such programs as Head Start, there also 
is a strong belief that some new ideas may be needed to shake up American 
education. 
</P>
<P>
Choice is the idea now attracting the most attention, an idea that suddenly 
blossomed in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how it happened," Chubb said. "But I'm pleased. When I first 
started, I was looked on as a lunatic. Now I wouldn't call it mainstream, but 
there's an awful lot of enthusiasm for the idea."

NOVELIST GETS SIX MONTHS IN JAIL FOR STEALING BOOKS 
</P>

<P>
Gustav (Gus) Hasford, a novelist and screenwriter who was nominated for an 
Academy Award last year, was sentenced to six months in jail and five years of 
probation Wednesday for stealing almost 800 books from nine libraries. 
</P>
<P>
Hasford, co-writer of the screenplay for the movie, "Full Metal Jacket," was 
taken into custody immediately and was led from the San Luis Obispo County 
Superior courtroom in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
He had been charged with grand theft but in December Hasford negotiated a plea 
with the prosecutor to possession of stolen property. Hasford originally was 
charged with stealing more than 1,000 books -- worth about $20,000 -- from 63 
libraries. Among the books discovered were several rare 19th-Century volumes 
from a library in London. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the jail time, Superior Court Judge Warren Conklin also fined 
Hasford $1,100 and ordered him to pay shipping costs for the return of 748 
books to the nine libraries throughout the country and to one individual. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin agreed with the prosecutor's recommendation of a six-month jail term 
for Hasford. 
</P>
<P>
"If Hasford had stolen hundreds of wheelbarrows, he would get a stiff 
sentence," Conklin said, "and he should get a stiff sentence for stealing the 
books." 
</P>
<P>
But Hasford's attorney, Orlan Donley, said the six-month sentence was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"Hasford has been an outstanding citizen all his life and this one crime was an 
aberration," Donley said in a telephone interview afterward. "It's very unusual 
for somebody like this to get so much jail time. I thought it was uncalled 
for." 
</P>
<P>
San Luis Obispo County Deputy Dist. Atty. Teresa Estrada-Mullaney, who 
prosecuted the case, said Hasford's sentence would serve as a lesson that 
stealing library books is a serious offense. 
</P>
<P>
Hasford's library collection was discovered in March, 1988, when campus police 
at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, looking for library books Hasford had checked out 
at the campus and had not returned, searched his rented storage locker and 
found about 10,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
Hasford, who lives in San Clemente, won critical acclaim for his first novel, 
"The Short-Timers," based on his experience as a combat correspondent with the 
1st Marine Division in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive of 1968. Stanley 
Kubrick purchased the rights to the book, and Hasford shares screenwriting 
credit on "Full Metal Jacket" with Kubrick and Michael Herr. The writers were 
nominated, but did not win, an Academy Award for the screenplay. Hasford 
recently completed a sequel to "The Short-Timers" entitled "The Phantom 
Blooper," that will be released in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
During the first few court hearings, Hasford did not appear to be disturbed by 
the charges and frequently joked with reporters. After one court hearing, he 
claimed that he was innocent and added: "In the immortal words of Richard 
Nixon: 'I am not a crook.' " After another court hearing he quipped to 
reporters: "I've got a quote for you. I've seen Elvis. I've talked to Elvis. 
Elvis is alive." 
</P>
<P>
But Wednesday, after the sentencing, Hasford was in a grim mood, according to 
his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
"Gus was shocked," Donley said. "He's an easygoing guy, but the sentence shook 
him up pretty bad."

DEMOCRATS RELENT, VOTE TO BACK DEUKMEJIAN'S NOMINEE FOR TREASURER

<P>
A Democratic-controlled Assembly committee, which just last month directed 
partisan jabs at Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's nominee for state 
treasurer, relented Wednesday and recommended that the full Assembly confirm 
Auditor General Thomas W. Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-member panel, acting without debate or further testimony, voted 11 to 0 
to support Hayes' nomination. Four Democrats on the committee, including 
Chairman Thomas M. Hannigan of Fairfield, joined with seven Republicans in 
approving Hayes, although most Democrats either failed to appear or did not 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
After the session, a confident-sounding Hayes predicted that he would be 
confirmed by both houses when they meet today to consider his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually expected a positive vote today and that's what I got," Hayes said. 
"I think it's part of the process to give nominees a hard time and they 
certainly did give me a hard time at the first hearing. But this time it went 
very smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate Rules Committee has already voted unanimously to support Hayes. So 
Wednesday's Assembly committee recommendation was generally seen as a sign of 
clear sailing ahead for Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes is the governor's second choice for the job. His first nominee, Rep. 
Daniel E. Lungren of Long Beach, won narrow Assembly approval early last year 
but was rejected in the Senate amid partisan opposition to his conservative 
voting record and his perceived ambition for higher office. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, by contrast, had never registered in a political party and had never run 
for office. But a promise to Deukmejian that he would register as a Republican 
and run for treasurer in 1990 fueled partisan concerns of several top Democrats 
in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Their opposition was strengthened by a behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign 
launched by acting Treasurer Elizabeth Whitney, who hoped to hold on to the job 
so she could use it as a base to run for the office as a Democrat. Whitney took 
over the post after the death in August, 1987, of Democrat Jesse M. Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Democratic Caucus 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's committee vote followed a closed-door Democratic caucus in which 
opponents, led by Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos and Caucus Chairwoman Maxine 
Waters, both of Los Angeles, failed to persuade their colleagues to join them 
in blocking Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Roos described the caucus discussion as "intense, with strong opinions" 
advanced by both sides. "A lot of (Democrats) are defaulting on the decision," 
Roos told reporters after the vote. "They would rather get on with (dealing 
with) Proposition 103 and other concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Waters, however, said there may still be a chance to derail Hayes on the 
Assembly floor if Republicans are not unanimous in supporting his confirmation. 
Several Assembly Republicans, including GOP Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, 
were angry with Deukmejian for choosing the politically independent Hayes 
rather than a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"If he does not have every Republican vote, I don't know why Democrats should 
make him happy," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman for the Republican leader said Johnson will vote for Hayes and 
"he thinks virtually all Republicans will vote for him as well. He doesn't see 
any problems." 
</P>
<P>
According to Waters, Hayes may have shored up his support within the GOP by, 
among other things, promising a job in the treasurer's office to former 
Assemblyman William P. Duplissea (R-San Carlos), who was defeated in the Nov. 8 
election by Democrat Ted Lempert. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes denied he had offered a job to Duplissea or anyone else, telling 
reporters: "I've not made one promise anywhere along the line." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bill Introduced 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Senate Majority Leader Barry Keene (D-Benicia) 
announced the introduction of legislation designed to curb the treasurer's 
ability to use his office as a base to raise campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
Keene's bill would require the treasurer to justify to the Legislature every 
instance in which competitive bids were not used to select an underwriter for 
lucrative bond issues. The office currently has nearly unrestricted ability to 
select underwriters without competition, and many of the winners tend to be 
major contributors to the treasurer's campaigns.

RESIDENTS REPORTEDLY FLEEING LIBYA'S CAPITAL

Residents of Tripoli jammed filling stations to gas up their cars in a flight 
from the Libyan capital hours after hearing that U.S. warplanes shot down two 
Libyan jets over the Mediterranean, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
It said Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi's home has been turned into a fortress, 
with anti-aircraft missiles mounted on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug has its own correspondent in Tripoli, and his reports have often proved 
reliable in the past. 
</P>
<P>
In its report, Tanjug said that "only a few hours after" the United States shot 
down the Libyan planes, "migration of citizens from Tripoli was noticeable." 
</P>
<P>
Filling stations in Tripoli "were jammed with cars, the same way as before the 
American attack" on the North African nation in April, 1986, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Moments after the news of the latest incident, "an avalanche of protests 
against 'American aggression' struck Libya," with political activists calling 
for "armed struggle" against the United States, Tanjug said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanjug reported that Libya had taken heavy military precautions following word 
that U.S. fleet movements were under way in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that mobilization of Libya's reserve troops reportedly has been 
ordered, and military aircraft based at airfields on the Mediterranean coast 
have been moved inland to points in the Sahara desert. 
</P>
<P>
In Tripoli, guns were mounted at key street intersections, and Kadafi's 
personal guard took over traffic duties from police, Tanjug said.

VERIFICATION OF GAS PLANT A MURKY TASK; 
</P>
<P>
GLOBAL INTELLIGENCE EFFORT USED TO BUILD CASE AGAINST LIBYA

<P>
In contrast to facilities producing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, 
facilities that make chemical weapons are becoming increasingly hard to 
distinguish from ordinary industrial plants turning out pesticides and 
medicines, arms control analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The murky problem of verification -- the difficulty of telling a benign 
chemical plant from one manufacturing chemical weapons -- is a major barrier to 
a treaty to control the increasingly worrisome proliferation of chemical 
weapons in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
According to a variety of government and industry analysts, however, there are 
few doubts, at least among American experts, about the purpose of the large 
industrial plant in the Libyan desert at Rabta, 40 miles southwest of Tripoli, 
that has become a new object of contention between the United States and Libyan 
leader Col. Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
The Libyans insist that the plant, known as Pharma-150, is being built to 
manufacture pharmaceuticals. U.S. officials say that it is on the verge of 
manufacturing mustard gas and possibly sarin, a far more lethal nerve gas. 
</P>
<P>
This concern, officials say, is based in part on global intelligence efforts 
that monitor exports and imports of critical materials for such plants, 
including glass-lined piping and unusual corrosion-resistant steel alloys. It 
is a task, they note, that is far better suited to human intelligence-gathering 
than satellite photography, although satellites are believed to have been 
monitoring construction and other aspects of the Libyan project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by Missiles 
</P>
<P>
While U.S. officials have been reluctant to disclose detailed intelligence that 
they say supports this contention, they note that the Libyan plant is unusual 
in at least one respect: It is surrounded by anti-aircraft missile 
emplacements. 
</P>
<P>
"A chemical manufacturing plant is a chemical manufacturing plant. It can 
manufacture all kinds of chemicals," William F. Burns, director of the Arms 
Control and Disarmament Agency, acknowledged Wednesday at a breakfast meeting 
with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
But if Pharma-150 is what Libya insists it is, Burns added, it would be "the 
most heavily defended pharmaceutical plant in the world." 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Olson, an arms control analyst with the Chemical Manufacturers' Assn., 
reinforces the point, noting that "most countries don't view aspirin as a 
target of opportunity" in need of such costly protection. 
</P>
<P>
"You also have to ask if a pharmaceutical plant makes any economic sense," 
Olson observed. "For Libya, does it make sense to build a pharmaceutical plant 
out in the east end of nowhere, to wade into an oversaturated world market?" 
</P>
<P>
As further evidence of its weapons mission, according to other sources familiar 
with the Libyan facility, U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded that 
Pharma-150 contains metal-machining equipment obtained from Japanese firms for 
producing artillery shells or gas canisters for use in other munitions. These 
sources said the United States has obtained corroborating information from 
foreign technicians who have worked at the Libyan plant. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence agencies also are believed to monitor shipments and 
commercial transactions with national security implications, using 
communications intercepts involving Libya and an array of other sources. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. sources said this week that Libya has been moving equipment associated 
with weapons production away from the chemical plant in an effort to protect it 
from retaliation. The officials would not say how they knew of the Libyan 
activity at the plant, which was described as taking place only within the last 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
Although there appear to be few doubts among U.S. analysts about the nature of 
the Libyan plant, the broader problem of telling innocent chemical plants from 
weapons plants is one of the knottiest on the arms control agenda of industrial 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
Satellite photography, for example, is said to be less useful than when used to 
pick out ballistic missile facilities and nuclear weapons production plants. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, chemical weapons plants had a number of distinguishing features 
that would show up in photographs, such as tall ventilator stacks and large air 
filtration systems. Now, however, such signs are less-certain indicators of 
weapons activity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strict Standards 
</P>
<P>
As industry has adapted to increasingly strict environmental and occupational 
health standards, ordinary chemical plants have acquired these and other exotic 
features, such as steel piping and reaction vessels lined with glass and 
double- or triple-sealed pumps to guard against leaks. 
</P>
<P>
With changing industrial standards, the task of discerning the purpose of a 
suspicious plant, an Administration expert said, begins with looking at the 
collective implications of a package of "indicators," which in turn requires 
knowing how a plant is built, what key materials are involved and the degree of 
precautions taken to protect workers from toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
The toxicity of chemical weapons such as mustard gas and nerve agents is 10 
times to 1,000 times greater than pesticides and requires a corresponding 
degree of built-in protection. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want their people to last more than a couple days on the job, they're 
going to have to isolate piping and valves, and men are going to have to go 
around in peculiar rubber suits," said this analyst, who asked not to be 
identified by name or agency. 
</P>
<P>
Although similar precautions are taken in modern pesticide plants, he noted, 
"there is a discernible difference" in facilities designed to produce chemical 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
A further sign of intent to produce chemical weapons, at least in developing 
countries, is the importation of exotic anti-corrosion alloys. When sarin, a 
fluoride-based nerve gas, is manufactured, even glass-lined piping dissolves. 
</P>
<P>
One indicator of an interest in making sarin, officials said, is the import of 
high-nickel alloys. They declined to say, however, whether Libya was known to 
have imported such alloys for its plant. 
</P>
<P>
The scale of pharmaceutical plants is also much smaller than chemical weapons 
plants, which have to produce larger doses. 
</P>
<P>
While tiny amounts of toxins can be lethal in confined spaces, the military use 
of chemical weapons usually requires large quantities of the poisons. 
</P>
<P>
Weapons plants, government analysts said, also tend to lack supplies of steel 
drums and other forms of packaging for their product.

over the Mediterranean entered production at roughly the same time, more than 
15 years ago, and fly at similar speeds and altitudes. 
</P>
<P>
However, the two-man American planes carry more sophisticated radar and 
weaponry than the single-man MIG, according to available information. 
</P>
<P>
The F-14 Tomcat, which began aircraft carrier trials in 1972, remains "the 
premier all-weather, day-night air defense fighter in the world," according to 
the Navy. Production by the Grumman Corp. is expected to continue into the 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The MIG-23, known by its NATO designation as the Flogger, entered active duty 
in 1973, according to "Jane's All the World's Aircraft." It is flown by all the 
air forces in the Moscow-led Warsaw Pact, and by 1987 it had been sold to 12 
other countries, according to Jane's. 
</P>
<P>
The Flogger's 46-foot wingspan, fully extended at takeoff, sweeps back to about 
25 feet wide as the fighter cruises at Mach 2, twice the speed of sound, or 
about 1,400 m.p.h., at its maximum altitude of 59,000 feet, according to 
Jane's. 
</P>
<P>
The MIG-23 is armed with one 23-millimeter GSh-23-L twin-barrel gun and can 
carry four R-60 Aphid and two R-23 Apex air-to-air missiles, Jane's said. 
</P>
<P>
Before Wednesday's incident, Libya had about 131 MIG-23Es, as well as other 
Soviet-built fighters: 44 MIG-21s, 67 of the more advanced MIG-25 Foxbats and 
92 Sukhoi 20/22 fighters. Additionally, Libya had 22 French-made Mirages, 
according to "The Military Balance," published by the London-based 
International Institute for Strategic Studies. 
</P>
<P>
Like the MIG-23, the American F-14 is a "variable-geometry," or swept-wing 
aircraft, taking off with wings spread to 64 feet and flying with the wings 
swept back to 38 feet as it approaches a top speed of 2.34 times the speed of 
sound, or 1,544 m.p.h. at its ceiling of 50,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Tomcat carries a pilot and a radar weapons officer. It is armed with an 
M-61 Vulcan 20-millimeter gun and can carry four Sparrow and four Sidewinder 
air-to-air missiles, or a different mixture of Sparrow, Sidewinder and Phoenix 
missiles, or it can carry bombs, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the F-14's strongest points is its sophisticated radar system, which is 
capable of looking down and over great distances while tracking 24 targets at 
once, according to the Navy. The AWG-9 weapons tracking system can fire up to 
six Phoenix missiles while continuing to scan the airspace, the Navy said.

Hundreds of Americans and other mourners bowed their heads and fought back 
tears Wednesday at a memorial service for the victims of the bombing of Pan 
American World Airways Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher stood among 700 people packed into 
Dryfesdale Parish Church as the Rev. James Whyte, head of the Church of 
Scotland, endorsed her call for no retaliation for the attack. 
</P>
<P>
Sheltering under umbrellas against the rain, local people huddled with visitors 
outside the church to follow the service, relayed by loudspeaker, and remember 
the Dec. 21 disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"This, we now know, was an act of human wickedness," Whyte said in his sermon 
to relatives, government ministers, politicians, rescue workers and Pan Am 
staff from around the world. "That such carnage of the young and of the 
innocent should have been willed by men in cold and calculated evil, is horror 
upon horror," Whyte said. 
</P>
<P>
But as the international hunt continued to identify the bombers, he urged the 
congregation to reject the idea of retaliation and further violence. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing that way but bitterness and the destruction of our own 
humanity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
All 259 passengers and crew aboard the New York-bound Boeing 747 were killed 
and 11 people died on the ground when wreckage slammed into Lockerbie, setting 
homes and cars ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the church, Thatcher and other members of her government stood alongside 
U.S. Ambassador Charles H. Price II at the simple, 40-minute ecumenical 
service, which was broadcast live on national television. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
200 Relatives of U.S. Victims 
</P>
<P>
About 200 relatives of American crash victims were believed to have been flown 
to Lockerbie by Pan Am. 
</P>
<P>
Wreaths lay piled outside the church and passers-by paused throughout the 
morning to look at sad, rain-soaked flowers outside the town hall, turned into 
a temporary mortuary. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the disaster, helicopters collecting crash debris fell 
silent Wednesday, but police said the search -- covering an area of 150 square 
miles -- was continuing outside the town. 
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Angus Kennedy said 242 bodies had been found, of which 149 had 
been identified.

EUROPEAN SECURITY TALKS REPORTED NEAR AGREEMENT

<P>
The 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been 
meeting in Vienna for more than two years, is on the verge of an overall 
agreement, diplomatic sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The final breakthrough was the result of the United States agreeing to a Soviet 
proposal that a human rights conference be held in Moscow in 1991, on condition 
that the Soviets continue to improve their record on human rights, the 
diplomats said. President Reagan announced his assent to the Moscow conference 
on Wednesday from his new home in Bel-Air, where he has been spending the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Most important, an agreement in Vienna would lead almost immediately to the 
long-awaited mandate for a new conference on the reduction of troops and arms 
in Europe, known as "conventional stability talks." 
</P>
<P>
"We think the CST could begin as soon as February or March," an American 
diplomat in Vienna said Wednesday. "Right now, it looks as if everything can be 
wrapped up in a final (security conference) document to sign within two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in Bonn on Wednesday 
that Alois Mock, the Austrian foreign affairs minister, had invited officials 
of the participating nations to attend the windup of the security conference's 
meeting in Vienna on Jan. 17-20. 
</P>
<P>
The new conventional arms talks, expected to be held in either Vienna or 
Geneva, would replace the long-moribund mutual and balanced forces reduction 
talks, which have been going on for 15 years with no result. 
</P>
<P>
The security conference, under way since November, 1986, is the third follow-up 
conference to monitor the original Helsinki accords of 1975, signed by all 
European nations except Albania, plus the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The new conventional stability talks will involve only the 16 nations of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the seven members of the Communist 
Warsaw Pact, although European neutral countries will be kept informed. 
</P>
<P>
But the conventional arms talks will cover a much broader concept of Europe -- 
from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains, as it has been expressed. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna talks had been expected to move quickly but ran into difficulties -- 
with the Soviet Union over the human rights issue, and even with France, which 
objected to arms talks between power blocs rather than a European-wide 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Other NATO nations argued that serious discussions on reducing conventional 
arms should involve only NATO and the Warsaw Pact, because including other 
European countries would only confuse the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has been determined to hold a human rights conference in 
Moscow, sponsored by the security conference, which would follow a similar 
rights conference this year in Paris and another next year in Copenhagen.

U.S. TIES 1991 TALKS TO SOVIET RIGHTS PROGRESS; 
</P>
<P>
WHITE HOUSE SEES CONFERENCE OK AS A MOVE TO KEEP KREMLIN ON COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Reagan Administration said Wednesday that the participation of the United 
States in a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991 will depend on continued 
Soviet movement toward international human rights standards. 
</P>
<P>
Formally announcing President Reagan's decision to approve participation in the 
meeting, along with U.S. representation at human rights conferences this year 
in Paris and next year in Copenhagen, a White House spokesman said that the 
decision is seen as a means of encouraging the Soviet Union to continue on the 
course it has chosen over the last three years. In that time, emigration has 
been allowed to increase significantly and the jamming of Western radio 
broadcasts to the Soviet Union has ceased. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union now has a unique opportunity to take further action to 
demonstrate its continuing and irreversible commitment to achieve commonly 
accepted human rights standards," said Deputy White House Press Secretary Roman 
Popadiuk. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, perhaps one of the last major ones regarding the Soviet Union 
that Reagan will make during his presidency, reflects the distance the 
President has traveled in his view of the Soviets, as well as the underlying 
suspicion with which he continues to regard them. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan, who took office eight years ago viewing the Soviet Union as an "evil 
empire," remains skeptical of Soviet intentions. He said three weeks ago that, 
despite the "heady, inspiring" progress made, "we've got to proceed by watching 
whether deeds match the words." 
</P>
<P>
But by announcing that U.S. representatives would take part in a human rights 
conference in Moscow, clearly a potential public relations victory for the 
Soviet Union, the President was giving a diplomatic pat on the back to the 
Kremlin leadership, although his decision could be reversed at any time during 
the next two years by the incoming Administration of President-elect George 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reviewed Decision 
</P>
<P>
A Bush spokesman said in Washington that "we were consulted and aware of this 
announcement." He added that before the decision was made, the Reagan 
Administration reviewed it with the President-elect, his secretary of 
state-designate, James A. Baker III, and Brent Scowcroft, Bush's choice for 
national security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
The human rights conferences would bring together representatives of the 
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact. The 
meetings would be part of the continuing Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, which began in Helsinki, Finland, in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters in Beverly Hills while Reagan wound up a nearly 
two-week vacation at his new home in Bel-Air, Popadiuk said that the President 
decided to accept the schedule of human rights conferences, beginning in Paris 
later this year, "as a means of encouraging continuation of the significant 
progress in human rights that has taken place in the Soviet Union over the past 
three years." 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman singled out "the release of hundreds of political prisoners and 
exit permission for many people long refused the right to emigrate." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said in Moscow that the United States would accept about 
50,000 to 60,000 Soviet emigres this year -- perhaps twice the number who 
arrived in the United States in 1988 -- reflecting the upsurge in departures 
from the Soviet Union. And, in another human rights issue often cited in the 
past by the United States, the jamming of the Voice of America, Radio Liberty 
and other Western broadcasts has been halted. 
</P>
<P>
Popadiuk described as "crucial" new laws respecting individual liberties that 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has promised to establish as well as "the 
institutionalization of reform."

TRADITIONAL APPEARANCE BEFORE CONGRESS DATES TO POWDERED-WIG DAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH FOLLOWS ANCIENT RITUAL, DECLARES HIMSELF VICTOR

<P>
By a quirk of antiquated American law, George Bush Wednesday became the first 
vice president since Martin Van Buren 150 years ago to inform Congress 
officially that he had won the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to this two-month-old "news" and the formal counting of electoral 
votes, members of the House and Senate erupted into cheers and gave Bush a 
standing ovation as he declared himself and his running mate, Dan Quayle, the 
victors over Democratic foes Michael S. Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd M. Bentsen 
(D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
While the tradition, dating back to the days of powdered wigs, is regarded as 
laughable by many lawmakers, Bush's role as presiding officer for the Electoral 
College announcement was required by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, for example, Vice President Richard M. Nixon had to certify that 
John F. Kennedy had defeated him for the White House in 1960. In 1837, Van 
Buren announced that he had won a lopsided race against William Henry Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving in a half-empty chamber for the quadrennial ritual, Bush was pounded 
on the back and his hand was pumped steadily by the applauding members of 
Congress, especially the Republicans lining the center aisle of the House 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
He was preceded by two teen-aged pages carrying leather-trimmed mahogany boxes 
with leather straps -- suitable for stagecoach travel or the pony express -- 
that contained the formal certifications of electoral votes from the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
Wielding a mean left-handed gavel, Bush called the rather raucous audience to 
order and instructed the four tellers, two from the Senate and two from the 
House, to begin reading the results that were first flashed to the nation by 
television on the evening of Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
A comic note was introduced into the droning roll call by Rep. Frank Annunzio 
(D-Ill.), one of the House tellers, who forgot to identify Bush and Quayle as 
the winners in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
"Six votes for President and six votes for vice president," pronounced 
Annunzio, ignoring the script he had been handed. 
</P>
<P>
Bush himself leaned over from the Speaker's chair to ask: "Who won that 
election?" 
</P>
<P>
As the audience broke into laughter, Annunzio had the last word: "Obviously, 
they all knew the answer anyway," he said with a flourish. The rest of the call 
of states went off without incident. 
</P>
<P>
During the recital of the stale election returns, Bush made small talk with 
Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.)about the Electoral College, quail-hunting in Texas 
and life as a President-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about the procedure," Wright told reporters afterward. "It's kind of 
an antiquated process, from the day of powdered wigs and snuff boxes. Of 
course, if I lose any more hair, I could use a powdered wig myself. 
</P>
<P>
"We observed that it is the first time since Martin Van Buren that a vice 
president announced his own election," the Speaker said. "We discussed how this 
is a frill, in a sense, but a nice frill." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hunting Chat 
</P>
<P>
As for quail, Bush noted that lack of ground cover prevented him from bagging 
as many birds as he would have liked during a hunting trip to Beeville, Tex., 
and the two men compared notes on shotguns as the electoral count proceeded. 
</P>
<P>
As for Quayle, he did not attend the Capitol Hill ritual where his election as 
vice president was proclaimed formally. Neither did Dukakis or Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
During their rambling talk, Wright said, Bush indicated that he would deliver 
his State of the Union message to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 8 or Feb. 
9, about three weeks after his inauguration on Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Bush thanked Wright for his promise of bipartisanship made Tuesday during 
Congress' opening day ceremonies and said that there have been "no surprises" 
during his weeks of preparation for his Oval Office responsibilities, the 
Speaker added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Print-Outs 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a step never imagined by the Founding Fathers who created the 
Electoral College in the 18th Century, the tellers signed computer print-outs 
showing the 1988 election totals. 
</P>
<P>
Bush became the focus of attention again when he rose to announce that he had 
received 426 electoral votes to 111 for Dukakis, and, because of a West 
Virginia elector's independent mood, a single presidential vote for Bentsen. 
Quayle's total was the same as Bush's. 
</P>
<P>
"This announcement shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the election of 
the President and vice president for the term beginning Jan. 20, 1989," the 
President-elect solemnly intoned. Then, with another sharp left-handed bang of 
the gavel, Bush declared the joint session dissolved and received a resounding 
cheer. Meanwhile, Bush continued to mull over the choices for his two remaining 
Cabinet-level appointments, amid indications that he could name a secretary of 
energy this week, perhaps as early as today. A decision on the other remaining 
post, the newly created Cabinet-level drug czar, appears to be further away as 
Bush aides continue to argue over what sort of person is best suited to the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
For the energy post, a leading candidate is James R. Schlesinger, secretary of 
energy under President Jimmy Carter, secretary of defense under President 
Gerald R. Ford and a Bush campaign surrogate during this year's presidential 
race. Bush also has been considering Environmental Protection Agency chief Lee 
M. Thomas for the job as well as former Rep. Henson Moore of Louisiana and 
Peter Johnson, the head of the federal Bonneville Power Administration and a 
protege of Sen. James A. McClure (R-Ida.).

VIETNAM MEMORIAL FOREST SAVED FROM BANK SALE

<P>
A forest planted by a Vietnam veteran in memory of Americans who died in the 
war was saved Wednesday when supporters raised enough money to stave off a bank 
foreclosure sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the good Lord sent them," said Geoffrey Steiner, who started the 
project on his own nine years ago and says he is more than halfway toward his 
goal of planting a tree for every American who died in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Fruth Companies Inc., a beer distributor in Brainerd, gave $5,400 toward the 
$6,033.53 needed to keep the 100-acre forest near Cushing, about 120 miles 
north of Minneapolis, from being sold. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money to save the Veterans National Living Memorial came from 
Vietnam Veterans of America chapters and individuals from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Veterans of America chapters in Dayton, Ohio, and Junction City, Kan., 
also have raised several hundred dollars to pay property taxes on the tract, 
said Terry Thompson, legislative coordinator for the Dayton chapter. 
</P>
<P>
There also are plans to place the property in a trust, said Thompson, who 
arrived in Minnesota earlier this week to help with the fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
The site is on a hilltop three miles off a U.S. highway at the end of a country 
road. Older white birch trees loom above the trees of various types that have 
been planted in the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
At the center is a wooden flagpole with an American flag, and a stone marker 
with words from the Bible, beginning: "Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced 
to death . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Steiner, 39, a Marine in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968, said his memorial differs 
from those made out of granite. "What we're trying to do is heal the people," 
he said. "This is a living memorial." 
</P>
<P>
He said he paid $23,000 for the land in 1980 after selling his home in 
Minneapolis. Since then, Steiner has planted more than 30,000 trees. His goal 
is to plant a tree for each of the approximately 58,000 U.S. soldiers killed in 
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Steiner was about to lose the land for failing to repay an $8,000 loan from 
Randall State Bank that he had secured with the property in 1984 to buy a car 
for his wife. If the land had been sold, the only way Steiner could have gotten 
it back would have been to match the winning bid within a year, the bank's 
lawyer had said.

HOWLING WINDS PUT NORTHEAST IN DEEP FREEZE

Howling winds and plummeting temperatures Wednesday turned the Northeast into a 
giant icebox from Maine to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Atop Mt. Washington in New Hampshire, winds gusted to 110 m.p.h. early 
Wednesday and, with the temperature at 17 degrees below zero, the wind chill 
was minus 85 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"That's cold enough to make you put your earmuffs on," Peter Crane at the Mt. 
Washington Observatory said. He said winds at the summit averaged 89 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
An ice climber who got lost Tuesday on the 6,288-foot mountain (the highest 
peak in the Northeast) was rescued Wednesday. Jim Church of Pleasantville, N. 
Y., was found by rescue crews as he began his descent from the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Climber Got Frostbite 
</P>
<P>
"He's essentially OK, but he does have some cold injury to his feet," Mike 
Torrey of the Appalachian Mountain Club said. "The fact that he survived at all 
is to his credit." 
</P>
<P>
Church sheltered himself in scrub pines below the summit to ward off the cold, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of homeless people crowded into New York City shelters Wednesday as 
temperatures hovered in the upper teens and winds gusted to 35 m.p.h., 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
At Caribou, Me., brisk winds dropped the chill factor to between 45 and 55 
degrees below zero Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters blamed the wind and cold on the first major storm of 1989, which 
dumped up to 8 inches of snow on parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania but skipped 
across the East Coast without producing the heavy snow that had been predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Weather Service spokesman Lyle Alexander said the storm was well out in the 
Atlantic Ocean, but it intensified once it hit the water and pulled Arctic air 
and strong winds into the East from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the nation, high temperatures in at least five cities broke or 
tied records on Wednesday. Brownsville, Tex., with 85 degrees, North Platte, 
Neb., at 61, and Norfolk, Neb., at 53, set records. Jamestown, N. D., with 41 
degrees, and Devil's Lake, N. D., with 36 degrees, tied existing marks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a storm moving in from the West Coast dropped 4 inches of snow on 
Flagstaff, Ariz., and freezing rain glazed highways at the Navajo National 
Monument. Rain spread through much of the desert Southwest and caused minor 
street flooding at Kingman, Ariz.

CANCER INSTITUTE OFFICIALS URGE FASTER DRUG APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Officials from the National Cancer Institute Wednesday joined the growing 
effort to change the approval process for new drugs to treat life-threatening 
illnesses, urging that "significant regulatory obstacles" that hinder the 
drugs' development be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"It is of utmost importance that the regulatory process not unduly slow the 
efficient transfer of the newest drug discoveries to cancer and AIDS patients," 
said Dr. Bruce Chabner, director of the institute's division of cancer 
treatment. "For many patients, certain drugs or drug combinations, while 
technically experimental, provide the patient with the only realistic hope for 
survival." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testify Before Panel 
</P>
<P>
The officials were testifying before a new federal advisory panel convened by 
Dr. Armand Hammer, top executive of the Occidental Petroleum Corp., at the 
request of President-elect George Bush to study ways to improve the process of 
evaluating drugs for AIDS and cancer. The new panel is a subcommittee of the 
President's Cancer Panel. It is expected to complete its work in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, there have been increasing complaints from the public sector 
-- especially activist gay groups -- and some federal health officials over the 
pace at which new drugs reach desperately ill patients. Last fall, about 1,000 
angry gay demonstrators and their supporters attempted to shut down the 
headquarters of the Food and Drug Administration in suburban Maryland. About 
150 protesters were arrested on misdemeanor charges. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the FDA announced new, streamlined procedures that it said would 
hasten the drug approval process, but critics called the proposals "smoke and 
mirrors," saying that they could not be implemented without significant 
increases in staff and funding. 
</P>
<P>
Hammer and others said Wednesday that the FDA proposals are not adequate. 
"They're just not enough," Hammer said. 
</P>
<P>
But FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young told the committee that improving the 
quality and speed of the process "continues to be FDA's highest priority." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not complacent," he said. "As commissioner, I pledge that FDA will 
continue to do all it can to ensure that important medical advances reach the 
desperately ill as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Chabner told the panel that there should be greater leeway in allowing new 
drugs to be tested quickly on humans and that researchers should be permitted 
more flexibility in changing trials in their early stages to allow them to 
administer two or more experimental drugs that show promise working together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Tests on Children 
</P>
<P>
Further, Chabner said, the FDA should encourage the early testing of new drugs 
on children with AIDS and cancer, rather than waiting until they have first 
been tested on adults, "particularly in life-threatening diseases when there is 
currently no curative treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, the institute believes that insurers and the Health Care 
Financing Administration should "negotiate a more liberal reimbursement policy" 
for experimental drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We are encountering a growing resistance on the part of government and 
third-party payers to reimburse for the costs of medical care to patients 
receiving experimental therapies," he said. " . . . Such a situation is clearly 
contrary to the Administration's goal of delivering effective new treatments to 
the public as expeditiously as possible."

ARCHDIOCESE, UNION AGREE TO FEB. 8 VOTE BY GRAVEDIGGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Amalgamated Clothing and 
Textile Workers Union announced Wednesday that they have agreed to a Feb. 8 
election to determine if the archdiocese's cemetery workers will be represented 
by the union. 
</P>
<P>
The state Mediation and Conciliation Service will conduct the voting by the 140 
gravediggers at the archdiocese's 10 cemeteries and supervise the vote count at 
a church later that day, the announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
Church and union representatives also agreed to set up a fact-finding panel to 
settle any pre-election disputes. 
</P>
<P>
The organizing campaign started last spring, and the question of whether and 
when an election would be held has been a source of contention for several 
months. In October, the National Labor Relations Board said it would not 
conduct an election, stating that to do so could lead to "excessive 
entanglement" of a government agency in church affairs and thus violate the 
First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, the union asked Archbishop Roger M. Mahony to agree to an 
election supervised by a neutral third party. He agreed and initially an 
election was set for mid-January. The date was changed after the archdiocese 
objected to some of the union's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's pact resolved one key dispute between the two sides. The union 
agreed that none of its organizers will enter cemeteries to electioneer between 
now and the vote. But the church agreed to let union representatives stand 
immediately outside the cemeteries to campaign among the workers as they leave 
and enter work.

GROUP CALLS FOR CHECKS ON RADON TESTING FIRMS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMER ORGANIZATION CITES ERROR RATE OF 3 OUT OF 7 COMPANIES IN STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A consumer action group organized by Ralph Nader called Wednesday for more 
stringent government testing of home radon testing companies after its own 
independent study found that three of seven firms failed to accurately measure 
concentrations of the radioactive gas. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Public Citizen, said some of the false readings were too high. 
Others were too low. In some cases, the unwary homeowner could wind up making 
unnecessary and expensive repairs to lower non-existent radon levels or be 
lulled into a false sense of security, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those tests show that an alarming number of radon test kits currently on the 
market may not be doing the job," Public Citizen President Joan Claybrook told 
a Washington press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The seven firms account for about 70% of all home radon kits sold in the United 
States. Three of the seven companies that the group said had failed its tests 
immediately challenged the findings and said the Public Citizen study was 
unscientific and unprofessional. 
</P>
<P>
Radon is the nation's second-leading cause of lung cancer, after smoking. The 
National Academy of Sciences has estimated that radon accounts for 13,000 
deaths a year. Because radon is believed to compound the harmful effects of 
smoking, the academy has said that most of those deaths would be among smokers. 
</P>
<P>
The findings from their yearlong but limited study, Claybrook said, point up 
the need for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to impose more stringent 
tests before recommending testing companies to the public. She noted that all 
seven companies had previously passed EPA tests. 
</P>
<P>
About 850 companies have been placed on the EPA's "approved list" after the EPA 
testing. But the agency does not actually certify the firms and has no plans to 
seek congressional authorization to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA admitted Wednesday that its testing procedures were flawed and 
announced that a limited number of more rigorous tests, such as those 
undertaken by Public Citizen, will begin next spring at the urging of the EPA's 
scientific advisory panel. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the EPA said consumers should not be overly concerned by 
Public Citizen's results. EPA spokesman Chris Rice said that in cases in which 
high radon readings are found, the federal agency recommends longer-range and 
more accurate testing before homeowners take steps to reduce radon levels. 
</P>
<P>
Ned Doyle, a spokesman for Air Chek, an Arden, N.C., company that failed one of 
Public Citizen's two testing rounds, vigorously disputed the findings. "I have 
never seen a program run so poorly, so unscientifically, supposedly in the 
public interest. This is staggering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the other two companies that failed at least one of Public 
Citizen's two tests -- Douglas Martin &amp; Associates of Emmaus, Pa., and 
Barringer Laboratories Inc. of Golden, Colo. -- voiced similar views. Both said 
their firms had not only been repeatedly approved by the EPA, but that the 
accuracy of their test kits had been verified by customers who conducted their 
own quality assurance tests. 
</P>
<P>
The four companies in the study winning Public Citizen's endorsement were Radon 
Testing Corp. of America of Elmsford, N.Y.; Teledyne Isotopes of Westwood, 
N.J.; Key Technology of Jonestown, Pa., and the Radon Project of Pittsburgh, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Separate Tests 
</P>
<P>
Public Citizen's consumer arm, known as Buyers Up, conducted the tests. A total 
of seven to eight radon testing kits from seven companies were exposed in two 
separate tests to what the group said was a predetermined amount of radon and 
then sent back to the companies for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
In one of two separate testing rounds, Public Citizen said Air Chek 
overestimated radon levels by 68%. Barringer Laboratories reportedly 
underestimated radon by 50%. Douglas Martin barely failed, with an average 
error of 26.8%. The consumer group said that any firm whose reading varied from 
actual concentrations by more than 25% was failed. 
</P>
<P>
All the radon test kits tested were charcoal canister types, which are useful 
in making short-term measurements usually lasting 24 hours to a few days. 
</P>
<P>
But, even when the charcoal canister readings are accurate, they have limited 
value beyond informing the homeowner that more extensive testing may be needed. 
That is because levels of radon gas, which seeps up from the soil and is sucked 
into homes through cracks and other openings, vary from day to day and season 
to season. 
</P>
<P>
The Times last year placed a different kind of radon detector in 436 Southern 
California homes for 12 months and found that about 50,000 homes, or 1.2% of 
Southern California households, exceeded radon limits of 4 picocuries per liter 
of air recommended by the EPA. The detector used by The Times is known as an 
alpha-track detector and is marketed by Terradex Corp. Terradex detectors were 
not among those tested by Public Citizen. But the consumer group gave Terradex 
high ratings for consumer service.

A mountain lion that apparently roamed into Reno in search of food led police 
on a 6 1/2-hour chase Wednesday before it was captured as it lounged on the 
patio at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the 65-pound female lion, which was first spotted at the Peppermill 
hotel-casino before daybreak, was stung by two tranquilizer darts as it lay 
under a bench at the Hacienda del Sol restaurant near the Peppermill. 
</P>
<P>
Reno Animal Control and state Department of Wildlife workers took the drugged 
lion away. Wildlife spokesman Dave Rice said the animal will be taken to a 
remote area outside Reno and released. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls began coming into the police station at about 5:25 a.m., when a 
parking lot attendant at the Peppermill and several Virginia Lake joggers 
reported seeing the animal, Sgt. Greg Dion said. 
</P>
<P>
Dion said animal tracks were spotted by police leading from the Peppermill to 
Virginia Lake. 
</P>
<P>
The lion dropped out of sight until just before noon, when workers preparing 
lunch at the Hacienda del Sol saw it on the patio, according to restaurant 
manager Barry Rivlin. 
</P>
<P>
Rice said mountain lion sightings are not unusual in Reno, although the animals 
usually slip in and out unnoticed.

GOLDEN MONKEY ON LOAN FROM CHINA DIES AT SAN DIEGO ZOO

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Zoo officials acknowledged Wednesday that a rare Chinese golden 
monkey on loan from China died last month, probably of tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
Tissue samples from the monkey's liver, kidney and lymphatic system have been 
sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory in Ames, Iowa, to confirm 
the zoo's preliminary findings, zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
He said a needle biopsy on the monkey, a 14- or 15-year-old female called Jing 
Tong, "indicated the possibility of tuberculosis." However, the exact cause of 
death will not be determined until two veterinarians representing the China 
Wildlife Conservation Assn. arrive in about two weeks to help conduct a full 
autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, all zoo employees who have been in contact with the golden 
monkeys are being tested for tuberculosis, Jouett said. Of 22 people tested, 17 
have tested negative and five were still awaiting results. 
</P>
<P>
"Tuberculosis is transmitted from monkeys to humans and from humans to monkeys 
through the air. It requires close and prolonged contact . . . visitors to the 
zoo are not at risk," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Jing Tong, along with a male and another female golden monkey, was on a 
two-year breeding loan from China that is due to expire in April. They are the 
only Chinese golden monkeys currently in the United States. In 1985, the zoo 
received on loan the first pair of golden monkeys ever exhibited outside of 
China.

BROWN REWARDS FRIENDS AND PUNISHES HIS FOES; 
</P>
<P>
NO REPUBLICAN, DISSIDENT DEMOCRAT GETS ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIP

<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, rewarding his friends and punishing his foes, 
unveiled his committee assignments for the new legislative session on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
No Republican nor any member of the dissident Democratic "Gang of Five" was 
named by the San Francisco liberal to chair any of the 24 committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GOP Leader Not Surprised 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra said he was neither 
surprised nor disappointed by Brown's choices of committee chairmen. Pointing 
out that all of the 24 standing committees have solid Democratic majorities, he 
said, "I can't imagine why a Republican would want to be chairman." 
</P>
<P>
A GOP source said the Speaker did not automatically accept a list of preferred 
committee assignments presented to him by Johnson, as he had previously with 
lists submitted by former GOP Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale. Nolan, who had a 
comfortable relationship with Brown, resigned his leadership post under fire in 
November in response to the continuing FBI investigation of political 
corruption that has included him as one of the targets. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, several of the members of the "Gang of Five" -- who last year tried 
to topple Brown from the speakership -- did relatively well in their new 
committee assignments. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Assemblyman Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) became a member of the Public 
Safety Committee. This will give him a visible forum to push for passage of 
law-and-order bills, one of his greatest interests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Speakership Fight 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the rebel group, Assemblyman Gerald R. Eaves (D-Rialto), got 
a seat on the Governmental Organization Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Brown stripped all five gang members from prestigious committee 
slots when the speakership fight was running hot. But he later returned some of 
them to less important positions. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Elihu M. Harris (D-Oakland) was named as new chairman of the Public 
Safety Committee, replacing former Assemblyman Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), 
who moved to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno) was named to head the Health Committee to 
replace the late Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker (D-Inglewood), who died of cancer 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
Brown abolished two committees: Veterans Affairs and International Trade and 
Intergovernmental Relations. They were downgraded to subcommittees because 
neither panel considered many bills, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker earlier had said he would revise the membership of the powerful 
Finance and Insurance Committee by removing some members he perceived to be too 
responsive to the wishes of the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
Removed from the committee were GOP Leader Johnson; Marian W. La Follette 
(R-Northridge); Phillip D. Wyman (R-Tehachapi); Steve Clute (D-Riverside) and 
Teresa P. Hughes (D-Los Angeles). Sen. Stirling also was a member last session. 
They were replaced by former GOP Leader Nolan, Charles Bader (R-Pomona); Stan 
Statham (R-Oakland); Bob Epple (D-Norwalk); Richard E. Floyd (D-Hawthorne) and 
Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles).

HISTORIC MANSION THAT ESCAPED DEMOLITION IS GIVEN REPRIEVE BY CITY 
</P>

The McKinley Mansion, a historical landmark that was saved from the wrecking 
ball at the last minute, has been given a temporary reprieve by city officials 
who revoked a demolition permit that had been issued by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Taylor, chief of the city Department of Building and Safety, said he is 
adding a new post, preservation coordinator, to prevent similar errors. He said 
the coordinator will examine all demolition permits to make sure all 
requirements have been met before a historical building can be razed. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the McKinley Mansion, the demolition permit should not have been 
issued Friday because the owner had not filed an environmental impact report 
with the city, Taylor told a meeting of the Cultural Heritage Commission on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrong Address 
</P>
<P>
While the Department of Building and Safety keeps historic landmarks and other 
such buildings specially flagged by address in its files, the mix-up came about 
because the contractor asked for a demolition permit for 300 Lafayette Park 
Place instead of the mansion's actual address, 310 Lafayette Park Place, Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The day after the permit was issued, a contractor began demolishing the house, 
knocking off porches and making gashes in the main structure. Neighbors alerted 
police. A building inspector called to the site stopped the demolition. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Brown, an assistant city attorney, said Wednesday that his office is 
investigating whether it should take criminal or civil action against the 
owner, and has ordered the owner to cease demolition, weatherproof the 
building, and within 30 days begin repairing damages. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Lee, who represents a consortium developing the property, did not attend 
the commission meeting and could not be reached for comment Wednesday. However, 
last weekend Lee showed The Times his demolition permit and said he believed he 
was authorized to destroy the house to make way for a 140-unit apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
The 13,000-square-foot house was given landmark status in 1987. It was built in 
1917 by Maytor H. McKinley, a mortuary operator. The mansion, surrounded by 
apartment buildings, is the last of a handful of large family dwellings that 
graced Lafayette Park Place northwest of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Under city law, owners of historical landmarks can apply for demolition 
permits. However, preservationists are given up to a year to work out 
compromises to save the structures or find a buyer. If no compromise is 
reached, the owner must delay demolition until he obtains city approval of an 
environmental impact review detailing the alternatives to knocking down a 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council declared a six-month moratorium on demolition of the McKinley 
Mansion in the fall of 1987. There was an option to renew the moratorium 
because it appeared that a preservation-minded buyer would make an offer for 
the property. However, the deadline passed in July without the opposition, led 
by the Los Angeles Conservancy, coming up with a way to save the mansion. The 
Cultural Heritage Board had no other option but to lift the stay. But the 
environmental impact review was still required. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchase Attempts 
</P>
<P>
A San Fernando Valley developer, Rod Daniels, and his wife, Sherry, who have 
restored several such mansions, have been attempting to purchase the mansion 
and move it to Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's meeting, Building and Safety officials said they would ask 
police to keep an eye on the mansion until its fate is determined. 
</P>
<P>
Daniels said he will ask Lee to reinstate a caretaker on the property. The 
former caretaker was let go last week. "I'm willing to pay for around-the-clock 
security. I'm afraid of what could happen to an empty, unoccupied house," 
Daniels said. "I mean, if it caught fire, it would really be history."

A 16-year-old Palestinian youth was reported killed and five other Palestinians 
wounded in clashes with Israeli soldiers. The Israeli army confirmed the death 
of Nasser Ismail Nasser in a Gaza Strip refugee camp. Meanwhile, an army 
official said the military is investigating the death of an 11-year-old 
Palestinian whose family charges that he suffered a fatal head injury when 
pushed out of a military jeep Dec. 10. The official said there is no evidence 
the youth was ever in military custody.

A study by the Boston University School of Medicine suggests that women under 
the age of 45 who use oral contraceptives may be facing an increased risk of 
breast cancer, a finding that contradicts earlier studies. The research, one of 
several studies to be presented today at a hearing of the Food and Drug 
Administration, found that women who used oral contraceptives had twice the 
risk of breast cancer compared to women who have never used the pill. For women 
who have used the pill for 10 years or more, the study found, the risk of 
breast cancer was increased four times. The findings were based on a study of 
407 women with breast cancer and a cancer-free control group of 424. Dr. Samuel 
Shapiro, director of the Slone Epidemiology Unit at Boston University, said in 
a news release the new study contradicts findings in earlier studies, which 
indicated there was no association use of the pill and development of breast 
cancer. Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer organization, called 
on the government to revise labeling of the pill in response to the studies.

DEFICIT AS HIGH AS $141 BILLION PROJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Congressional Budget Office disclosed that it expects the federal deficit 
for next year to be $141 billion if Congress does not approve any changes in 
current spending or tax policies. By comparison, the White House's Office of 
Management and Budget forecasts its "baseline" deficit at $127 billion for the 
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. The difference between the two forecasts is 
mostly due to varying assumptions about how the economy will perform over the 
next year. The Gramm-Rudman budget law calls for lawmakers to cut the deficit 
to less than $110 billion next year, so the CBO report implies that Congress 
must find roughly $30 billion in spending cuts or tax increases, while the OMB 
projection suggests that only about $17 billion in deficit reductions are 
required. Both agencies are required to present more up-to-date estimates in 
August, closer to the Gramm-Rudman deadline in October, but only the OMB 
projections are used in the final determination of whether Congress has met the 
requirements of the budget law.

A crowded Philippine ferry carrying more than 140 people -- mostly students 
returning to school after the holidays -- capsized, leaving 16 people dead and 
12 missing, the coast guard said. Coast guard Lt. Edmund Lustre said the Jem II 
sank off Tablas Island on Tuesday afternoon when it was hit by big waves during 
a voyage from the Tablas port of Looc to neighboring Panay Island. Lustre said 
114 people were rescued. He said the exact number of people aboard was not 
known. Radio reports said the passengers panicked when the large waves struck 
the vessel and rushed to one side, causing the ferry to capsize.

Staffers from two European television stations in unrelated incidents attempted 
to put fake bombs aboard scheduled airline flights in apparent journalistic 
tests of airport security. At New York's Kennedy Airport, Bruce Frankel, a 
producer, and Alain Chaillou, a bureau chief for French station TF1, were 
arrested after phony bombs with mocking notes were left for shipment on 
Paris-bound flights. In Amsterdam, TV station Veronica filmed one of its 
reporters carrying an attache case with an imitation bomb through security and 
onto a plane at Schipol Airport. Air France, TWA and Pan Am were the New York 
"targets."

Soviet readers were told that the Kremlin was responsible for the murder almost 
49 years ago of Leon Trotsky in his exile in Mexico. Historian N. Vasetsky 
wrote in the weekly Literary Gazette that Trotsky, who with Lenin forged the 
1917 Bolshevik Revolution, was assassinated in 1940 in an operation ordered 
from Moscow and run by a secret police agent. "Stalin could not forget old 
insults . . . either he himself took the decision or he let his entourage know 
that it was time to put an end to Trotsky," Vasetsky wrote, acknowledging what 
has long been believed in the West.

BOTTOM LINE PUSHED COUNTY TO SETTLE SUIT BY LANDSLIDE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County faced economic disaster if it continued to resist settling 
with 240 landslide victims on Big Rock Mesa in Malibu, but it still took some 
intense lobbying of county officials to arrive at a tentative $97-million 
agreement, several of the chief negotiators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The county faced costs of more than $200 million if it lost a massive trial 
scheduled to begin next month, plus another $20 million in legal fees if the 
case lasted more than three years as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the county yielded, both because of the costs it faced and from 
pressure to settle from the California Department of Transportation and dozens 
of insurance firms, which had already suffered huge financial setbacks in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Economic Hemorrhaging' 
</P>
<P>
"It was a case where the bottom line became how to stop the economic 
hemorrhaging," said attorney Al Buckner, who represented several of the 
insurance companies. "Ultimately, it became a numbers game." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement announced Tuesday ended nearly five years of litigation to 
decide who was responsible for the damage to and destruction of 250 Malibu 
homes during a 1983 landslide. Under the terms, the county will pay the 
property owners $35 million, Caltrans will furnish $40 million and the 
insurance companies will contribute the remaining $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly persuasive in the negotiations was attorney Karl Samuelian, one of 
Gov. George Deukmejian's chief fund-raisers who was hired by the county to work 
on the case last year, and the Superior Court judge in the case, Robert I. 
Weil. 
</P>
<P>
Weil, who has been trying to get a settlement in the Big Rock case for more 
than three years, is credited by all the lawyers in the case with breaking the 
log jam. He interrupted a vacation to attend the key settlement meeting last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was the Christmas spirit or maybe it was the holidays, but somehow 
they all decided that maybe it would be wise to abandon these extreme 
positions," Weil said. "I'm paid to do only one thing, and that's keep the puck 
out of the net. The net is going to trial. 
</P>
<P>
"When all the sides looked at what they faced, it was my job to show them that 
it might be better (to settle) than slugging it out for three or four years. 
This settlement fits what I call the equal-stink test, where if everyone thinks 
it stinks a little and is a little unhappy with it, then it's probably the 
right settlement. I think that's what we have here." 
</P>
<P>
Samuelian presented his case to the Board of Supervisors during a closed 
meeting Tuesday, emerging with the final piece needed to swing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Uncertainty' Cited 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of the defense and the uncertainty of what the future would bring, I 
think, culminated in the settlement," Samuelian said. "I was one of the few 
people in a detached position who could assess the case in global terms." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners had sued the county and the state for approving development of 
Big Rock Mesa with seepage pits and horizontal drains rather than sewers. They 
claimed that the county's action contributed to a rise in ground water that 
triggered the September, 1983, landslide. 
</P>
<P>
The county responded by filing more than 300 countersuits against past and 
present Big Rock Mesa homeowners, arguing that property owners caused the slide 
by allowing water to build up from septic tanks, showers and toilets instead of 
following drainage procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative settlement will erase the need for the massive trial with more 
than 275 lawyers involved. 
</P>
<P>
It also means that none of the parties involved will have to admit 
responsibility for the landslide at a time when the homeowners' attorneys said 
they had some explosive evidence to show a jury. The lawyers said they could 
show from internal county memos that county officials were aware of the 
potential danger to Big Rock homeowners and failed to warn them two years 
before the landslide struck and turned some million-dollar homes into rubble. 
</P>
<P>
However, the homeowners were ready for a settlement, said Richard Norton, one 
of the homeowners' lead attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a series of interdependent pieces that had to fall into place before 
we could reach an agreement," he said. "But the key factor in all this is that 
the case had grown to a point where it had become completely unmanageable. It 
was beyond control in both its size and its cost." 
</P>
<P>
Combatants in the massive legal struggle point to a meeting held in Santa 
Monica on Dec. 29 as one of the turning points in the proposed settlement 
although that was not the meeting's initial purpose. 
</P>
<P>
It was held to find a way for the attorneys to reach a settlement involving 16 
additional Big Rock Mesa homeowners who had declined to participate in the 
settlement. Those property owners are still trying to reach a separate 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six at Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting was Judge Weil and five attorneys representing 170 of 
the homeowners' insurance companies involved in the case: Buckner, Charles 
Bennett, Raoul Martinez, Jon Kodani and Gene Weisberg. The meeting came three 
days after Weil spent most of Dec. 26 on the phone with settlement lawyers, 
trying to get them to agree to specific payment figures for the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
Although parts of the settlement had already been worked out, the attorneys 
spent all day in Kodani's law office trying to figure out a way to achieve a 
"global" agreement that would finally dispense with the entire case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers were reluctant to strike a deal that left out the 16 holdout 
homeowners but decided to work through lunch and ended up spending nearly eight 
hours conferring and arguing. They made more than a dozen calls to Norton and 
to Peter Anderson, an attorney in Samuelian's firm. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the day, a tentative settlement had been reached, dependent on 
the county's approval of the $35 million the following Tuesday. The county's 
offer, in turn, was based on the insurers agreeing to add $22 million to the 
pot. Caltrans had already said its settlement cost was based on the county's 
decision to pay a certain amount. The attorneys reluctantly agreed to leave the 
other 16 homeowners out of the settlement and resolve as much of the case as 
they could. 
</P>
<P>
"But for that week and that meeting, we would still be sitting in a settlement 
conference," Buckner said. "By the time we broke, we knew we had a deal. As 
long as everybody did what they said they would do." 
</P>
<P>
For his efforts, the lawyers gave Judge Weil one of the baseball caps they had 
made with an emblem of a leaking toilet. The emblem is inscribed, "The Battling 
Bastards of Big Rock." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

CHINESE GAMBLING GAMES ARE DEALT A LOSING HAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The high-stakes Chinese gambling games of pai-gow, pai-gow poker and pan 9 went 
bust late Tuesday at legalized gambling casinos in Los Angeles County as 
sheriff's deputies began enforcing a Dec. 29 appellate court ruling that 
declared the games illegal under commonly used rules. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies closed 65 tables and halted play for several hundred ardent bettors at 
six of the county's seven casinos -- including the Bicycle Club in Bell 
Gardens, the Commerce Casino in Commerce, the California Bell Casino in Bell, 
the Huntington Park Casino and the Normandie Club and the El Dorado Club in 
Gardena, said Sheriff's Vice Lt. Curtis Spears. 
</P>
<P>
Officers also ordered the games discontinued at the Horseshoe Club in Gardena, 
although none of the games were under way there at the time of the late-night 
crackdown, Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
The action will not affect several legalized forms of poker -- including 
seven-card stud and hold 'em -- but it is expected to cause heavy financial 
losses for casinos that have relied more and more on the popular Asian games. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Asian games have surpassed lo-ball and draw poker in 
importance as casino revenue producers, according to industry officials. Yearly 
revenues from the games have been estimated at several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
At the Normandie Club, where seven tables were closed Tuesday, as many as 19 of 
the club's 51 tables are regularly used for pai-gow poker and pan 9, also known 
as "Lucky 9," spokesman Blaine Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
Each table typically seats eight players and requires minimum $10 bets. At some 
higher-stakes tables, $75 and $100 bets are considered commonplace on each 
rapidly played hand, and occasionally a single wager may reach $1,000, 
Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
The games are considered similar to blackjack in that each player's cards are 
compared to those of a dealer. In pai-gow poker, a player receives seven cards, 
which he divides into two hands -- one with five cards and another with two. To 
win, the player must arrange his hands so that each is higher in total value 
than the dealer's corresponding two hands. 
</P>
<P>
Pai-gow is similar but is played with dominoes rather than cards. 
</P>
<P>
Pan 9 also requires a player to exceed a dealer's hand. But the game is played 
with several decks from which high-numbered cards have been removed. Each 
player is dealt three cards and the maximum value of any hand is nine points. 
</P>
<P>
County officials have waged a long legal battle against the games, because of 
the way most casinos take their profits and run the games. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, the house takes a percentage of winners' payoffs, collecting nothing 
from losers, said Deputy County Counsel Kevin Brazile. That enables the casino 
to encourage participation and to gain huge profits from the high-stakes games 
without suffering any financial risk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, casinos receive only a flat fee from players of traditional poker 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The state has outlawed so-called "percentage" games since 1885, Brazile said. 
</P>
<P>
But even in some clubs where players pay only a flat fee, the games are run 
with one player acting as the "bank," paying off winners and collecting from 
losers. Banking games also have been illegal in California for more than 100 
years, Brazile said. 
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the Asian betting games in Los Angeles has caused 
confusion, because the games are not singled out by name in the state law. 
</P>
<P>
The county began trying to stop the games in 1984, but the Huntington Park 
casino filed and won a lawsuit to keep the games operating. That legal decision 
was reversed by the 2nd District Court of Appeal, leading to Tuesday's 
crackdown, Brazile said. 
</P>
<P>
As officers ordered tables closed, casinos complied without protest and players 
simply left or moved on to other tables, according to Spears. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, casino operators vowed to fight the action. 
</P>
<P>
"The Normandie Club does not believe that the Asian card games . . . are in 
violation of the state's penal codes," Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized the crackdown by saying: "We don't feel it was a proper move. And 
the club will seek a court restraining order to reopen the games until the 
question of legality can be settled." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson said the Normandie Club does not run a percentage game, because it 
collects a flat fee -- usually $1 -- before each hand is played. Arguing that 
the games are legal because the house does not run the bank, Nicholson 
predicted that a ban would lead to the games "going underground," causing even 
greater law-enforcement problems. 
</P>
<P>
"At least here they are played in the open, they are supervised . . . and they 
are fair," he said.

Ed Noel, manager of the Huntington Park casino, said lawyers for one casino 
were trying on Wednesday to get a restraining order allowing the games to 
continue. Noel said his casino had complied with law enforcement requests to 
institute a flat fee -- $1 per hand -- and expressed surprise that authorities 
were now trying to stop the games.

ASIAN GAMBLING GAMES 
</P>
<P>
PAI-GOW -- An ancient Chinese game dating back centuries, pai-gow is considered 
the favorite gambling game in cities throughout Asia. Up to seven or eight 
players at a time try to beat the dealer, who collects from losers and pays all 
winners. Players receive four tiles, or dominoes, numbered with 2 to 12 dots. 
Each player separates the dominoes into two "hands," using the dots to 
calculate the value of each hand. To win, each of his hands must exceed the 
value of the dealer's corresponding two hands. If only one of the player's 
hands is higher than the dealer's, the bet is considered a "push" and no money 
changes hands. If the player does not win at least one of the hands, the dealer 
collects. 
</P>
<P>
PAI-GOW POKER -- In the Americanized version of this Asian card game, players 
receive seven cards and again try to beat the hands of the dealer. Each player 
divides his cards into two hands -- one with five cards, 
</P>
<P>
the other with two. The five-card hand must be higher in value than the 
two-card hand, and to win each hand must exceed the dealer's corresponding 
hands. If a player wins on one hand and loses on the other, the bet is 
considered a push. The game also is played with seven or eight players. In 
Asia, pai-gow poker is played with 13 cards, divided into three hands of 3, 5 
and 5 cards. 
</P>
<P>
PAN 9 -- Another game of beat the dealer that closely resembles blackjack. The 
game is played with eight decks of cards, but all numbered cards above six are 
removed. (Face cards have no value.) Each player is dealt three cards and the 
values are added together. The value of the hand is equal to the last digit of 
the sum. For example, a player receiving a 5, a 4 and a 6 -- which add up to 15 
-- would have a hand worth five points. A nine-point hand is considered 
perfect. A player may receive a fourth card on request.

TALKS ON GREYSTONE MANSION COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations to turn the Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills into a Westside 
branch of the County Museum of Natural History have collapsed, representatives 
of both sides said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after months of talks between Beverly Hills and county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
The museum would have featured exhibitions, educational programs and research 
at the city-owned mansion, originally built for the oil-rich Doheny family. The 
county would have paid about $2.5 million to renovate the structure, and one of 
the country's most extensive ornithology collections would have been housed on 
the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
But in the course of the negotiations it became clear that the city wanted to 
retain too much control over the county's use of the building, said James 
Gilson, an attorney for the Natural History Museum Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"The city understandably wanted to have a lot of flexibility over the site, but 
you can't have both flexibility and long-term commitment," Gilson said.

Pay raises of 4% for "satisfactory," 6% for "fully satisfactory" and 7% for 
"superior" job performance were approved Wednesday by the Los Angeles City 
Council for city department heads. The raises, which are retroactive to July 1, 
1988, will cost taxpayers about $200,000.

SMOKING ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS EASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Heeding protests from restaurateurs, the Beverly Hills City Council has dropped 
a requirement for expensive smoke ventilation systems in large restaurants and 
introduced a scaled-down smoking ordinance that requires restaurants to set 
aside at least 60% of their seating for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
Under the revised ordinance, which must go to the council on second reading, 
only large restaurants that open after Jan. 1 must install the ventilation 
systems. Also, new restaurants can avoid the requirement if they install walls 
separating smoking and nonsmoking areas. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance does not affect bars, lounges, private banquet rooms or 
restaurants in hotels. 
</P>
<P>
The new measure is a victory for restaurant owners, who complained that the 
ventilation systems would be expensive and cumbersome. The old law requiring 
the systems was passed in July, 1987, after restaurant owners protested a 
highly publicized ban on all smoking in larger restaurants.

SUSPECT CHARGED IN 2ND OF 13 HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man arrested as a suspect in a string of 10 armored car and three bank 
holdups in the past year was formally charged Wednesday with a second one of 
the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Bernard Young, 29, was charged by the district attorney's office with 
the $166,000 holdup of an armored car guard at the Cineplex Odeon movie complex 
Nov. 26 in Universal City. An alleged accomplice remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
Young is scheduled to be arraigned today in Municipal Court. He was charged 
last week with the $180,000 holdup of an armored car Sept. 16 outside a Los 
Angeles supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are reviewing the other holdups to determine whether Young will be 
formally charged in those crimes.

STRANGE HOPES FOR FASTER START THIS SEASON 
</P>

<P>
In the early 1980s, Curtis Strange was in a comfort zone. He wasn't winning 
many tournaments but he was finishing in the top 10 on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I was caught up in the top 10, the good check every week, and maybe I 
didn't give it that extra effort to win," he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's winning, having scored 7 of his 16 victories in the last 2 years -- 
and he's winning tournaments that are financially rewarding and prestigious, 
such as the Nabisco Championships, which earned him a $360,000 check, and the 
U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
Strange last year became the first player to win $1 million in a single season 
and was voted PGA Tour player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's a new year and the first of 49 tour events, the 37th MONY Tournament 
of Champions, begins today at La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Strange said he is aware that people will be watching him, perhaps speculating 
that he might not be as motivated as he was last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want people to say I backed off, or wore himself out in 1988," he 
said. "If I don't play well, it's not because I'm not trying." 
</P>
<P>
Strange said he also realizes that he can't dwell on his accomplishments of 
last year or, for that matter, the last 2 years, during which he won a total of 
$2,089,123. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing for me is to forget about last year as quickly as possible," he 
said. "I want to start like I've never done anything, and just work hard and 
play well." 
</P>
<P>
He would, of course, like to get off to a better start this year than he did in 
1988. His best finish in the first 10 tournaments was a tie for 12th in the Bob 
Hope Chrysler Classic, and he was 21st here in the Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to pick up where you left off last year, but the key word is 
patience," Strange said. "It's a long year." 
</P>
<P>
Strange doesn't particularly care to talk about his winning $1,147,644 last 
year, saying: "(Money talk) might alienate some people. They're working hard 
every day for a living and they don't want to hear about how much I'm making 
playing golf. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a number. In a few years, you'll have four or five guys (making $1 
million in a season), if purses continue to rise." 
</P>
<P>
For sure, the tour is lucrative. The T of C, for instances, carries a total 
purse of $750,000 and first-prize money of $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
The 49 Tour events will be worth more than $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
The field for today's tournament includes only winners of PGA Tour tournaments 
and the British Open in the last 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Among those challenging Strange and defending tournament champion Steve Pate 
are Masters champion Sandy Lyle, PGA champion Jeff Sluman, Greg Norman, Lanny 
Wadkins, Ben Crenshaw, Jay Haas, Paul Azinger, Ken Green, Mark Calcavecchia and 
Chip Beck. 
</P>
<P>
Seve Ballesteros, the British Open champion, is passing up this tournament and 
Larry Nelson, who qualified, can't play because of an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
It rained here early Wednesday, but the sun was shining in the afternoon. 
There's a possibility, however, of more rain today. 
</P>
<P>
It is, perhaps, a cliche, but, apparently, Strange knows how to win now. 
</P>
<P>
"When I get into contention, I feel very comfortable," he said. "Of course, I'm 
nervous and my stomach is churning, but when I say comfortable, I feel 
confident in my ability to play well. 
</P>
<P>
"The more confident you are, the better you can handle the pressure -- and 
everyone feels the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
As the defending U.S. Open champion, Strange rates the U.S. Open ahead of other 
tournaments, saying, "It's my open, your open and our open. The Masters is 
prestigious, but the Open is what you dream about when you're a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Strange won 4 tournaments last year, there were several 
tournaments, especially at the start of the Tour, when he wasn't in contention. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't in contention as much as I would have liked last year but, when I 
was, I took advantage of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Strange will settle for that same format this year. 
</P>
<P>
A separate PGA tour to provide opportunities for young golfers will begin in 
1990, it was announced Wednesday by PGA Tour Commissioner Deane Beman. 
</P>
<P>
The new tour has a 5-year agreement with the title sponsor, the Ben Hogan Co., 
and will be called the Ben Hogan tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It will not only create additional opportunities for young golfers, but it's 
also an opportunity to expand golf into new communities that don't have PGA, 
LPGA, or Senior tour events," Beman said. 
</P>
<P>
The top 50 players who come out of the PGA qualifying tournament are eligible 
to compete on the regular tour. Beman said the next group of 50 would become 
eligible for the new tour. 
</P>
<P>
Beman said there also will be local qualifying for the second tour. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities mentioned as possible sites for the Hogan tour were Glendale 
and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
It's estimated that there will be 30 annual events with purses of $100,000.

NEW NCAA DISCLOSURES MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE; 
</P>
<P>
ATHLETE EXCHANGING INFORMATION FOR ELIGIBILITY COULD CAUSE POTENTIAL CHEATERS 
TO THINK TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Nothing the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. has done so far, including 
Southern Methodist's death penalty, has proven sufficiently chilling in 
big-time sports. Just this year, three more college football programs were put 
on probation, SMU's lesson apparently long forgotten. Investigations were 
announced as often as before. 
</P>
<P>
But the disclosure that the NCAA has gotten Oklahoma State's Hart Lee Dykes to 
testify against his own school, while allowing him to continue his football 
eligibility, may cool some of the cheaters. They can no longer count on the 
complicity of the corrupted, or the high-mindedness of the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Newsday story Wednesday, Dykes was allowed to finish his college 
career in exchange for testimony against his school and three others that 
recruited him in 1985. Oklahoma, Illinois and Texas A &amp; M have been put on 
probation this year because of information provided by Dykes, who has since 
become the Big Eight Conference's all-time leading receiver. Oklahoma State is 
also expected to receive severe penalties. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the violations, so-called illegal benefits, nor the probations are new 
to college sports. But the use of immunity, whether offered or merely 
requested, to obtain evidence apparently is. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't recall that happening during my years," said Michael Gilleran, who 
headed a staff of NCAA investigators at one time and was later an assistant 
director of enforcement. Gilleran, now commissioner of the West Coast Athletic 
Conference, added: "I can't recall ever using it on any of my cases." 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that it is consistent with NCAA thinking, which is not so 
interested in penalizing players as institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, some people will say this is just wrong," he said. "The people that 
lost to Oklahoma State will say, 'This is silly. It's OK to lie, cheat, just so 
you can survive to your senior year, just play it out.' The worst thing that 
can happen is the team won't go to a bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
Not even that happened to Oklahoma State, which beat Wyoming in the Holiday 
Bowl to top a 10-2 season. And Dykes, who apparently testified that an Oklahoma 
State coach and several boosters provided him with a car and a cash allowance, 
suffered no sanctions at all. 
</P>
<P>
"But you just have to weigh that against the desirability of getting first-hand 
information," Gilleran said. "(The NCAA) theory is, kids come and go but 
institutions and policies remain in effect. Boosters are around 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what kind of squeeze the NCAA put on Dykes. According to the 
Newsday story, Dykes simply rolled over when the NCAA made a routine offer of 
immunity. However, Dykes did have legal counsel early in the NCAA's 
investigation, and it is Gilleran's theory that once Dykes was advised that his 
eligibility was in jeopardy, a lawyer intervened to minimize the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"Any lawyer worth his salt knows what's at stake," Gilleran said. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA, in trying to turn up illegal inducements, is apparently willing to 
offer its own incentives. This may not be fighting fire with fire, but it does 
mark the enforcement agency's willingness to get down and dirty. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, Dykes played the season as a kind of inside informer, apparently 
selling out the program for a year of eligibility. This sounds unseemly, but 
perhaps, Gilleran said, he had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I'm gonna hang or I'm gonna cut this deal,' " Gilleran said. 
</P>
<P>
But up to now, no other athletes have chosen to hang, indicating a loyalty too 
tough for the NCAA to penetrate. Dykes' underground cooperation may signal an 
end to that strange trust and introduce a new and even more powerful element in 
the NCAA's enforcement policies: paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
From now on, the boosters and coaches who provide illegal and unusual benefits 
to produce winning programs must be wary of the very people whose services they 
are trying to buy. An athlete who will play for a school for $1,000 in an 
unmarked envelope, which is one of 20 violations found at Oklahoma, may sell 
out for a better price, say eligibility, down the line. Still, Gilleran doubts 
that this will have a major impact. Noting that the SMU death penalty hasn't 
wiped cheating off the face of the earth, he said: "This may have the 
unfortunate byproduct of forcing people to cheat better. This attention does 
not improve morality but rather the methods of cheating." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the only answer, as always, is for university presidents to fire 
coaches who cheat, not coaches who finish 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
"You might ask what the message is when Barry Switzer continues to coach at 
Oklahoma," he said. "What's the lesson? The cynics would say, if you get away 
with something to the point of building a reputation, you ought to continue 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing changes, in other words. Players are still for sale; coaches are still 
buying. What's different is that the NCAA has announced itself as being in the 
market, bidding against the opposition.

WHICH WALSH IS STAYING AND WHICH IS LEAVING?

<TEXT>
<P>
This was the weekend you reluctantly turned down the invitation from the Mount 
Everest Triathlon to stay at home and compete in your own audio-visual 
ultra-marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to remote control, a bionic thumb and, of course, extremely limited 
amounts of liquid refreshment, you watched all or part of 12 football games 
over a 60-hour holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But seeing was not always believing. Were Dave Krieg and the Seattle Seahawks 
NFL or Yankee Conference? Should Troy Aikman be inducted into the NFL's Hall of 
Fame this summer, or be made to play an exhibition game first? 
</P>
<P>
If you lined up every serviceman who waved his arms for semaphore's sake in the 
last 50 years and multiplied by 10, would it equal half the arm-waving of the 
Miami Hurricanes? Hey, would you guys prefer to be called the Windmills? 
</P>
<P>
And what about Walshgate? Both Walshes have really good jobs, yet both are 
rumored to be staying and leaving at the same time and both keep issuing 
non-denial denials. 
</P>
<P>
Are they the same person, the product of a brilliant makeup artist? Why not a 
switcheroo? If Steve Walsh coached the San Francisco 49ers and Bill Walsh 
quarterbacked Miami, who'd win? Or care? 
</P>
<P>
Have you seen Bill Walsh? Has he always been freeze-dried? Or does it just look 
that way on TV because he was standing in fog at Soldier Field? 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't? That's next Sunday? Sorry, folks. You run a 60-hour, 12-game 
football marathon, you get a little confused. 
</P>
<P>
But on this, the fourth day of the New Year, things are becoming clear. The NFL 
season isn't quite over, but the college football season seems to be, now that 
Notre Dame has turned down Miami's invitation for an unofficiated, 
come-as-you-are rematch on an abandoned oil rig in the Straits of Hormuz. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Coach Jimmy "Pile It On" Johnson thinks his team got gypped out of the 
No. 1 ranking because it had an apparent touchdown nullified and later 
attempted (and missed) a two-point conversion in its 31-30 loss to Notre Dame 
last October in South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
That's just as well. Despite reports that the Miami program is attempting to 
erase its image as class-cutting, trash-talking, street-fighting men who live 
as if above the law, how can you take seriously any school whose students' main 
goal is a suntan? 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, on the other hand, is a No. 1 the world can respect. Unlike 
virtually every other big-time football power, Notre Dame has intentionally 
avoided steps that would further separate its players from the student body. 
</P>
<P>
At Notre Dame, there is no jock dorm. Football players live in regular dorms 
with the other students. Even share rooms with non-jock students. I'll never 
forget going to South Bend nearly 10 years ago to interview Notre Dame tailback 
and Heisman hopeful Vagas Ferguson and feeling somewhat strange as his friends 
on his hall, itty-bitty and average-sized Notre Dame students, stopped by to 
say hi. 
</P>
<P>
At most other schools, you go to interview a football player, you're surrounded 
only by other meat hooks. Not at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Redshirting, the rampant practice of holding a player (usually a freshman) out 
of competition for a year, is also done at most football factories. Often, 
there's nothing physically wrong with the player, other than that there's 
somebody better playing ahead of him at his position. He's redshirted so his 
body can further mature and grow while he awaits his chance. Of West Virginia's 
five starting interior offensive linemen in the Fiesta Bowl -- average size 
6-foot-3, 271 pounds -- all were redshirted, fifth-year seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Not at Notre Dame. At Notre Dame, a player is redshirted and becomes a 
five-year campus man only if he can't play that season because of serious 
injury. Otherwise, he is expected to play, to study and to graduate. Since 
1965, only seven Notre Dame football players have failed to graduate, a 98.7 
percent rate. That's admirable by any standard. 
</P>
<P>
Like Jane Fonda or Morton Downey Jr., Notre Dame is not something many people 
feel neutral about. As the most famous Catholic school in the country, its 
wonderful fight song standard fare for every marching band, its gridiron heroes 
immortalized on the silver screen (by future presidents, no less), Notre Dame 
will always suffer backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say if Notre Dame doesn't cheat, or cheats less than other big-time 
football programs, it's only because its national name is so glorious, its 
allure so magical, that it doesn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
Even with a poor schnook such as Gerry Faust running the program into the 
ground, Notre Dame got great recruits. But then, so do UCLA, USC, Nebraska, 
Oklahoma, Michigan, Auburn and Alabama. For every kid who wants to play at 
Notre Dame, there's a kid who wants to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're going to beat Notre Dame -- the Irish lose few top players to 
graduation this year and figure to be even better next season -- you better get 
lots of kids. That's what makes college basketball inherently more interesting 
than college football -- so many more teams have a chance to be in the top 20, 
if not No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Over the holidays, Alaska-Anchorage beat mighty Michigan in basketball. That 
could never happen in football -- even if Alaska-Anchorage had a team. 
</P>
<P>
In college basketball, you can land two or three blue-chip recruits and have a 
great team. In college football, you have to land 20 or 30, which is why it's 
so much harder to turn a college football program from also-ran to all-star. 
</P>
<P>
If three bright blue-chip basketball players chose Harvard, Harvard could go to 
the Final Four. That could never happen in today's big-time college football. 
</P>
<P>
But what has happened is Notre Dame, with its great name, and a great coach in 
Lou Holtz, is No. 1 for the first time in 11 years. And to the extent that 
people use No. 1 as a guiding light, Notre Dame is not a bad one to have.

NEWSWIRE: DALEY THOMPSON SAYS JOHNSON DESERVES LIFETIME BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daley Thompson, former Olympic decathlon champion, says Canadian sprinter Ben 
Johnson should be banned for life for testing positive for steroids at last 
year's Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope the authorities make sure that Ben Johnson can never run again because 
of the damage he has done to the sport," Thompson said in an interview 
published in Athletics Today, a weekly track magazine published in Great 
Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, the Olympic decathlon champion in 1980 and 1984 and the world 
champion in 1983, also said that drugs and commercialism have so tainted track 
and field that he does not want to see his young daughter enter the sport when 
she grows up. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather she played tennis or something else," Thompson said.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK; 
</P>
<P>
DRIVER-OF-YEAR AWARD IS A 4-WAY BATTLE THIS TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Shav Glick 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the time comes to select a driver of the year, the task is often an easy 
one. Last year, for instance, Dale Earnhardt was such a standout that he was 
virtually a unanimous selection. The year before, Bobby Rahal was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, no such standout developed among the major racing 
organizations in the country. Instead, four drivers emerged with outstanding 
credentials, giving the 10 members of the selection panel a difficult job. 
</P>
<P>
Listed alphabetically, the four are Geoff Brabham, champion of the 
International Motor Sports Assn. for sports cars; Bill Elliott, champion of the 
Winston Cup division of NASCAR for stock cars; Danny Sullivan, champion of 
Championship Auto Racing Teams for open-wheel Indy cars; and Rusty Wallace, 
fast-finishing Winston Cup runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham, 36, won 8 straight IMSA Camel GTP races in his turbocharged Nissan ZX, 
dominating the series as no one has since John Fitzpatrick won 8 of 11 features 
in 1980. Brabham, an Australian who lives in Noblesville, Ind., ended up with 9 
wins in 12 starts and added a postseason victory at Tampa, Fla., in the GTE 
World Challenge, which matched IMSA cars with Group C challengers from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
There are some who claim that IMSA is not on the same level with Indy cars or 
Winston Cup stock cars and that winning drivers often share their rides with 
others, thus watering down the significance of individual wins. 
</P>
<P>
During Brabham's hot streak, for instance, he shared his Nissan with John 
Morton at Road Atlanta, West Palm Beach, Watkins Glen and Elkhart Lake, and 
with Tom Gloy at Mid-Ohio. But he won driving solo at Lime Rock, Portland and 
Sears Point. 
</P>
<P>
Although IMSA fields are traditionally filled with drivers of lesser abilities, 
Brabham faced plenty of headliners in the series -- among them former world 
champion Mario Andretti, Indy 500 winners Rahal, A.J. Foyt and Sullivan, and 
such foreign stars as 5-time LeMans winner Derek Bell and world 
sports-prototype champion Martin Brundle of Great Britain, Jochen Mass of 
Monaco, Klaus Ludwig of West Germany and Sarel van der Merwe of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Brabham missed 2 of the first 3 races and trailed Jaguar driver John Nielsen, 
51-3, when the series reached Road Atlanta, its fourth stop. In the final 11 
races, Brabham outscored the West German, 183-89, and clinched the championship 
with his win at Columbus -- a race before the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
Precedent is against Brabham, though. No driver since the late Mark Donohue in 
1968 has been selected without having won either an Indy car or Winston Cup 
race. Donohue won the Sports Car Club of America's Trans Am championship and, 
like Brabham, 8 races in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, 33, won his first Winston Cup championship after a year-long battle 
with Wallace in which he won 6 of 29 races, 6 pole positions and for the fourth 
straight year went over $1 million in earnings. He was also selected as 
NASCAR's most popular driver for the fifth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
Awesome Bill from Dawsonville, as the redhead from Georgia became known when he 
won a million-dollar jackpot in 1985, finally overcame an inability to win on 
short tracks, a shortcoming that prevented him from winning the Winston Cup in 
1985 even though he won 11 other races. 
</P>
<P>
He drove the family-prepared Ford Thunderbird to his first short-track win, at 
Bristol, Tenn., and said, "I feel very relieved, like the whole world has been 
lifted off my shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Although some Southern writers criticized Elliott for taking a conservative 
11th-place finish in the year's final race at Atlanta, it enabled him to 
collect the $375,000 winner's bonus as champion, even though Wallace won the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, 38, won 4 of 15 races, 9 pole positions, set 10 track records and 
clinched the CART championship before the final race. This despite a slow start 
during which the 1985 Indy 500 winner scored only 2 points in the first 3 races 
while driving a Chevrolet-powered Penske PC-17. 
</P>
<P>
After a major disappointment in the Indy 500, when he crashed after leading for 
91 laps, Sullivan came back and won the next week at Milwaukee and then scored 
a major win in the Marlboro 500 at Michigan -- a track owned by his boss, Roger 
Penske. His average speed of 180.654 m.p.h. is a record for 500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's late-season surge continued with consecutive wins on an oval at 
Nazareth, Pa., and a road course at Laguna Seca. The win at Nazareth was also 
special to Sullivan, since he is a part-owner of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Racing's most eligible bachelor, Sullivan maintains homes in Los Angeles and 
Aspen, Colo. He earned $1,217,000 during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, 32, won 4 of the last 5 races to come within 24 points of catching 
Elliott in Winston Cup points. It was the third-closest finish in NASCAR 
history. Like Elliott, he won 6 races. 
</P>
<P>
The redhead from Fenton, Mo., was the only driver in the series to win races on 
a short track, superspeedway and road course, driving a Pontiac for former drag 
racing champion Raymond Beadle's team. Last June, Wallace won the final Winston 
Cup race at Riverside International Raceway, making it 2 in a row on the road 
course. 
</P>
<P>
The ballots are in and the name of the winner will be announced Saturday night 
during the American Auto Racing Writers and Broadcasters Assn. banquet at the 
Spruce Goose pavilion in Long Beach. Members of the AARWBA All-American team 
will also be honored and the Jerry Titus Memorial Award will be presented to 
the driver who received the most All-American votes. 
</P>
<P>
MOTOCROSS -- One of the largest fields in motocross history will compete this 
weekend in the opening round of the 13th annual Dodge Truck Golden State 
Nationals at Glen Helen Park in San Bernardino. The 8-race series, sanctioned 
by the Continental Motosport Club, will offer a $600,000 purse with an 
international field set for the professional classes. Sportsmen and amateur 
events will be held Saturday with the pros running Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Announced entries include such former national champions as Kawasaki's Jeff 
Ward and Ron Lechien, KTM's Broc Glover, Suzuki's Johnny O'Mara and Yamaha's 
Micky Dymond, plus defending CMC champions Kenny Zahrt and Sean Conley and 
British champion Jamie Dobb. 
</P>
<P>
VINTAGE RACING -- Riverside International Raceway will "reopen" once again this 
weekend for the Vintage Auto Racing Assn. There will be 5 races each on 
Saturday and Sunday on the new 2.5 mile track at the old facility. Cars will 
range from a 1968 McLaren to a 1947 Bentley, with no cars newer than 1972 
models eligible. 
</P>
<P>
TRUCK PULL -- Anaheim Stadium will open its Speed Month this weekend with the 
U.S. Hot Rod Grand Slam of Motorsports, featuring truck and tractor pulls 
Saturday night and mud bog racing Sunday afternoon. A Mickey Thompson Off-Road 
Gran Prix is set for Jan. 21, and a supercross on Jan. 28.

NO SURPRISES AS '88 ECLIPSE AWARDS ANNOUNCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There were no big surprises when the 1988 Eclipse Awards were announced 
Wednesday, with Alysheba, Personal Ensign, Ogden Phipps and Shug McGaughey 
heading the list of winners, and California horses and horsemen getting shut 
out in the few elections that gave the voters options. 
</P>
<P>
Alysheba, winner of the Santa Anita Handicap early in the year and first in 4 
straight major races, including the Breeders' Cup Classic, at the end, was 
voted the Eclipse -- thoroughbred racing's equivalent of an Oscar -- for best 
older male horse. Alysheba, whose earnings of $3.8 million last year enabled 
him to retire with a record-breaking $6.6 million, is a cinch to be named horse 
of the year when the result of that vote is announced on Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Personal Ensign was voted the best older female. She completed an undefeated 
career with a stirring victory, by a nose, over Winning Colors, the Kentucky 
Derby winner, in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. The first undefeated champion since 
Colin in 1907-08, Personal Ensign won all 7 of her starts last year and 
finished with 13 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
The people around Personal Ensign and one of her stablemates also won Eclipse 
Awards: Phipps, 80, was named the year's outstanding breeder and owner; 
McGaughey, who turns 38 Friday, was voted best trainer, and Easy Goer, another 
Phipps-McGaughey horse, was voted best 2-year-old colt. Phipps' horses earned 
more than $5.8 million, and from only 38 starters in major races, McGaughey 
produced 15 wins, 10 seconds and 5 thirds. 
</P>
<P>
Other Eclipse winners were Open Mind, 2-year-old filly; Risen Star, 3-year-old 
colt; Winning Colors, 3-year-old filly; Sunshine Forever, male grass horse; 
Miesque, female grass horse; Gulch, sprinter; Jose Santos, jockey, and Steve 
Capanas, apprentice jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron finished second to Santos in the only split vote among the three 
participating groups -- turf writers, racing secretaries at most major tracks 
and Daily Racing Form personnel. The turf writers and Racing Form voted for 
Santos but McCarron drew the support of the racing secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 219 ballots were cast, 70 more than in 1987, when the Eclipse system 
was criticized because only 63% of the eligible voters participated. 
</P>
<P>
For Santos, the Eclipse ended 3 years of frustration, during which he has led 
the country in purses every time but never won the award. In 1988, with purses 
of $14.7 million, he broke Laffit Pincay's 1985 record by about $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficially, Santos beat McCarron by about $150,000 in the money race. 
McCarron, winning 17 major races to Santos' 9 and winning a record 5 races 
worth $1 million or more with Alysheba, Forty Niner, Pay the Butler and King 
Glorious, was one of several California-based candidates who came up empty in 
the Eclipse voting. The others: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wayne Lukas, whose stable won a record 3 Breeders' Cup races at Churchill 
Downs and broke its own annual record with another $17-million year, lost out 
to McGaughey in the trainer vote, preventing him from winning a fourth straight 
award, which would have tied Laz Barrera's record. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas' horses fared better than their trainer, however, for he and his son, 
Jeff, trained 3 of the Eclipse winners -- Winning Colors, Open Mind and Gulch. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gene Klein, who, like Lukas, had won the owner award 3 straight years. In 
1988, Klein's horses won about $5.5 million, while running in four times as 
many races as the Phipps stable did. Winning Colors and Open Mind race for 
Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fernando Valenzuela, whose horses earned more than $1.7 million in Southern 
California, was among the runners-up to Capanas, who won about $2.2 million 
with more than twice as many mounts while competing on a lesser circuit in New 
Jersey and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- King Glorious, the undefeated 2-year-old colt and winner of the Hollywood 
Futurity. The voters chose Easy Goer, winner of 2 major races in New York and 
second, with excuses, to Is It True in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Easy Goer 
beat Is It True 3 times in New York. A virus cost King Glorious some training 
time, preventing him from running in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Great Communicator, who beat the champion, Sunshine Forever, in the 
Breeders' Cup Turf and 7 weeks later won the Hollywood Turf Cup. Great 
Communicator won 6 stakes to Sunshine Forever's 5 and both horses won 3 major 
races.

PHIL MAHRE'S COMEBACK WILL GET HEAVENLY THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Mahre will make his California professional racing debut this weekend when 
the U.S. Pro Tour comes to Heavenly Valley on the south shore of Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
After 3 events on the skiing-for-dollars circuit, Mahre is fourth in the 
standings, just behind his brother, Steve, who will be off tending to the 
twins' other business, their racing camp at Keystone, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
However, the youngest Mahre, Paul, is also expected to compete in the super-G 
Friday and the slalom Saturday. The finals start at 2:30 p.m. each day, 
following elimination rounds at 10:30 a.m. and freestyle aerial exhibitions at 
2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
All of the action will occur under the tramway on World Cup Run, where an 
80-foot ramp has also been erected for the airborne display. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the distinction between pros and amateurs in ski racing has almost 
disappeared in the last decade or so. Phil Mahre earned well into six figures 
as a so-called amateur when he won the World Cup in 1981-82-83 and the Olympic 
slalom gold medal in '84. 
</P>
<P>
Now 31, Phil and Steve decided to end their 4-year retirement from racing 
mainly to replenish their bank accounts with about $400,000 in endorsement 
money. 
</P>
<P>
That is in addition to any money they win on the tour's 16 stops, another of 
which will be Snow Summit, at Big Bear, March 9-12. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing's top money continues to be available in World Cup competition, which is 
resuming this week after the holiday break. 
</P>
<P>
The women are scheduled to race in a giant slalom today at Maribor, Yugoslavia, 
before going to Mellau, Austria, for a slalom and 2 giant slaloms Friday 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's slalom, Vreni Schneider of Switzerland holds a commanding lead 
in the overall standings with 157 points, more than double runner-up Ulrike 
Maier's total of 78. Another Austrian, Anita Wachter, is third with 62, 
followed by Swiss defending champion Michela Figini with 59 and American Tamara 
McKinney with 51. 
</P>
<P>
It's a tighter battle in the men's standings, which 3-time and defending 
champion Pirmin Zurbriggen leads with 122 points. Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg 
is second with 92, West German Armin Bittner third with 69. The men will tangle 
in 2 downhills and a super-G at Laax, Switzerland, Friday through Sunday, then 
go to Kirchberg, Austria, for a giant slalom Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Edwards, who startled the world with his unusual form and courage as 
Britain's 1-man Olympic ski-jumping team last February, hopes to be discharged 
today from a hospital in Innsbruck, Austria, where he ultimately landed after a 
training accident Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards told the Associated Press: "In my second training jump, I had a very 
good position (in the air), but I panicked because I never had such good (form) 
before. I bent my legs and then I landed on my face and shoulder. The impact 
knocked me out for a couple of minutes. But these things can happen to 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
"Eddie the Eagle," who suffered a broken collarbone, a concussion and assorted 
cuts and bruises, said doctors told him not to jump again for at least a week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll fly again," said Edwards, who plans to jump in the World Nordic Ski 
Championships Feb. 14-27 at Lahti, Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jan Bokloev of Sweden won the 90-meter jump at Innsbruck, third event of the 
annual Four-Hill series, which winds up Friday at Bischofshofen, West Germany. 
Jens Weissflog of East Germany leads the tournament with 637.5 points, just 1.5 
ahead of Finland's double Olympic champion, Matti Nykanen. 
</P>
<P>
An additional 2 to 6 inches of snow fell Tuesday night on the eight operating 
Southland ski resorts, which are reporting bases of 2 to 5 feet. Depths in the 
High Sierra range from 3 to 9 feet. 
</P>
<P>
One of the World Cup men's downhills at Laax is due to be shown on ESPN Sunday 
at 3 p.m., PST, following "Ski World" at 2:30. Bob Beattie's guests will be 
Stein Eriksen of Deer Valley, Utah, and various celebrities in attendance at 
the recent 21st birthday party thrown by Snowmass, Colo.

Arnold Palmer is here, so already the senior division of the MONY Tournament of 
Champions is a success. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 3 years since Palmer, still professional golf's most popular 
figure, has qualified for the tournament that officially opens the golf season. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer and 13 other 1988 tournament winners on the 50-and-older tour will play 
the first round of the 72-hole tournament at La Costa Country Club today, and 
an indication of the booming PGA Seniors Tour is the purse. Dave Hill won the 
rain-shortened 54-hole event a year ago and the purse was $100,000. This year 
it is $250,000 with $50,000 to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, especially with two of the stars missing, figures to be among the 
favorites. Bob Charles, leading money winner last season with more than 
$500,000, underwent a hernia operation just before Christmas and will be out 
for several weeks. South Africa's Gary Player, who won more money per 
tournament than any other senior, elected to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
But Palmer is the man the spectators want to see. For the pro-am Wednesday, the 
weather was rainy and the crowd was not big. A majority of those who braved the 
elements, however, followed Palmer. He laughed and joked with the spectators 
and obviously was in the best of spirits. 
</P>
<P>
It is quite a change from the way he felt in mid-September when he prepared to 
tee off in the Crestar tournament at the Hermitage Country Club in Virginia. It 
had been more than 3 years since he had won a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I was about at as low an ebb as I had been in many years," he said after 
shooting a par 72 in Wednesday's pro-am. "I was planning to maybe play one more 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really hit the ball that well, but my putting suddenly turned around. 
I didn't make any spectacular putts, but I didn't miss any short ones and was 
consistent." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer shot a 65, making 9 birdies in his 7-under-par round, and led wire to 
wire. 
</P>
<P>
During the 3 years, there were many tournaments in which Palmer wasn't even 
competitive. After winning the Crestar, he continued to threaten. Although he 
said he had not always putted well, he has stayed with the Peerless Palmer 
putter he picked up at the factory in July. 
</P>
<P>
Changing putters is an old Palmer habit. In fact, in the GTE at Simi Valley 
last spring, he used a different putter for each of the 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to fool yourself into thinking there's nothing wrong with your 
stroke, so it must be the club," he said. "Confidence can turn you from a 
mediocre or poor putter into a good one. Right now I have the confidence." 
</P>
<P>
With all 14 participants picking up prize money, Palmer just needs to finish 
the tournament to become a millionaire on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
He would have made it much sooner, but he takes considerable time off from 
playing to build courses and attend to other business ventures. Since the '60s, 
he has built or had a hand in building 125 courses, with 54 more in the works. 
</P>
<P>
"I always plan a light tournament schedule, but I always wind up playing more," 
Palmer said. "I just can't say no." 
</P>
<P>
For that, his Army is grateful.

ROLLING HILLS TITANS HANG IN THERE TO BEAT BEVERLY HILLS, 78-75 
</P>

<P>
Rolling Hills basketball Coach Cliff Warren expected a battle Wednesday night 
in his team's Bay League opener, and that's exactly what he got from visiting 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"I was petrified about this game," Warren said. "Now I know why." 
</P>
<P>
Plagued by foul trouble and a tenacious Beverly Hills team, the Titans 
considered themselves fortunate after hanging on for a 78-75 win. Beverly Hills 
nearly tied the game in the closing seconds but missed two 3-point shots, the 
last coming at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God we were at home," Warren said. "We would have lost on the road. We 
were really lucky tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills (10-3) encountered nothing but bad luck early. John Hardy, the 
team's top scorer and rebounder, picked up three fouls before the game was 3 
minutes old, but the 6-4 senior managed to stay out of trouble for the rest of 
the way and ignite a third-quarter rally. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy, who finished with a game-high 28 points, scored the Titans' first 15 
points of the third quarter to erase a 2-point halftime deficit and give 
Rolling Hills a 55-48 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans never trailed again, but two turnovers in the final 30 seconds 
nearly let Beverly Hills (6-4) off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 78-73, Beverly Hills stole the ball on an in-bounds play and scored on 
an offensive rebound by Jonah Naulls with 17 seconds left. Then, following a 
timeout, Rolling Hills guard Mark Tesar dribbled the ball off his foot out of 
bounds, setting up the dramatic finale. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob Poura missed on the 3-point attempt near the top of the key and, after 
Beverly Hills got the ball back in a scramble under the basket, Naulls missed a 
3-pointer from the base line as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the way you want to start league," said Beverly Hills Coach Jack 
Dyck. "Coming in here I thought we had a good chance of winning the game, but 
they out-executed us." 
</P>
<P>
Other than Hardy, Rolling Hills received big games from forward Rick Judge, who 
had a game-high 15 rebounds, and forward Ron Dinnel, who scored 8 of his 14 
points in the fourth quarter, including a rare 4-point play to open the period. 
</P>
<P>
Dinnel fouled out with 3:39 left to play, while Tesar and Judge played a good 
portion of the second half with four fouls each. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Michael Moore paced Beverly Hills with 24 points and did a good 
defensive job on Steve Clover, Rolling Hills' top 3-point shooter. After 
hitting three 3-pointers in the first quarter, Clover was ineffective from long 
range the remainder of the game and finished with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard 76, Serra 65 -- Center Ed Stokes scored 27 points, pulled down 12 
rebounds and blocked 6 shots to lead the Vikings (12-2) in a Camino Real League 
opener at Serra. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Eric Carpenter led Serra (4-7) with a game-high 31 points. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside 80, North Torrance 43 -- The Monarchs forced 26 turnovers with 
their pressing defense and had 14 players score en route to an easy Ocean 
League opening win at Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Chris Bance led a balanced attack for Morningside (7-4) with 14 points 
and 8 rebounds, guard Kenny Jones had 13 points, 5 assists and 5 steals, and 
center Jeff Crowe added 9 points, 12 rebounds and 5 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo 70, South Torrance 48 -- Senior guard David Dinnel scored 15 of his 
game-high 25 points in the second half to help the Sea Hawks pull away in an 
Ocean League opener at South. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth victory in the last five games for Redondo (8-4), which will 
play host to Morningside in an important league match-up Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Hawks opened a 25-20 halftime lead, then gradually increased the margin 
behind the scoring of Dinnel and forward Mike Houck, who finished with 15 
points and 7 rebounds. Center Steve Cottey added 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Shaw said Redondo applied more defensive pressure in the second 
half, resulting in several South turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
South (3-7) was led by forward Lance Holmes with 14 points and guard Ken Chieh 
with 13. 
</P>
<P>
Carson 88, Granada Hills 78 -- Center Vince Washington scored 24 points, 
grabbed 11 rebounds and ignited a big second half that carried the Colts to a 
non-league win at Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Leading by 1 point at halftime, Carson (6-5) opened a 69-60 lead in the third 
quarter by outscoring Granada Hills, 23-15. Guard Greg Lindsey scored 8 of his 
22 points in the third period while Washington scored 15 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Raymond Bennett added 16 points, 5 assists and 5 steals for Carson, which 
opens conference play Friday afternoon at Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 111, Gardena 58 -- Cleveland, still rolling after winning the 
championship of the Las Vegas Holiday Tournament last week, blew away Gardena 
after a close first quarter to post a non-league win in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers (10-2) outscored Gardena, 67-32, over the second and third 
quarters to put the game away. The Mohicans fell to 9-4. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Adonis Jordan, who signed early with Kentucky, led Cleveland with 
29 points, 15 assists and 6 steals. Gardena guards Chris Thompson and Darryl 
McMillan each scored 16. 
</P>
<P>
Inglewood 71, Leuzinger 64 -- If the opening game was any indication, Bay 
League fans can look forward to a lot of exciting, fast-paced basketball in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the league opener for both teams at Inglewood, the Sentinels surged ahead 
with an 11-2 run midway through the fourth quarter, then held off a furious 
charge by Leuzinger to record the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 55-52, Inglewood increased its lead to 66-54 with 2:25 left. But the 
Olympians cut the deficit to 68-64 with 18 seconds remaining. Inglewood 
protected the lead by converting 3 of 4 from the free-throw line in the final 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Miner led Inglewood (6-4 and 1-0) with 21 points and teammate Steve King 
contributed 14. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger (7-6, 0-1) was paced by Mac Williams' game-high 24 points, while Al 
Killehua chipped in 12. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester 95, San Pedro 65 -- Before this non-league contest at Westchester, 
the Comets gathered at one end of the court to pose for the team photo. Then 
they went out and played a picture-perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
Despite limited playing time, Zan Mason paced Westchester with 24 points and 
Renaud Gordon pitched in 15. The Comets, who substituted freely, received 12 
points from Julian Brame and 10 from Jim Bova off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
Westchester (7-3) took command in the second quarter by outscoring San Pedro, 
34-17, to take a 56-32 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Horton led San Pedro (5-5) with 16 points, John Wells had 15 and Willie 
Sanchez contributed 11. TIM DERMODY

CELTICS ROOKIE RON GRANDISON HAS ALL THE TOOLS, BUT SO FAR HE'S KEPT THEM IN A 
BOX NEXT TO THE BENCH; 
</P>
<P>
EX-ST. BERNARD FLASH SITS AND WAITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the emergence of a younger, quicker Celtics team, unwritten rules of 
the National Basketball Assn. are making Ron Grandison's rookie season a quiet 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The former St. Bernard High School standout, one of three first-year players to 
earn a Celtics uniform this season, fits neatly into new Coach Jimmy Rodgers' 
scheme -- he is big (6-8, 217), fast, loves to run the floor and leans on his 
rebounding and defense. But he's had about as much chance to prove himself as 
Gaston Green has with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
In the NBA a rookie's path to stardom, or simply seeing more than zeroes beside 
his name in the box score, usually requires a thankless apprenticeship. 
Veterans aren't about to yield minutes to unproven players, nor are first-year 
coaches about to force proven players onto the bench. 
</P>
<P>
So, though Rodgers often has called on former UC Santa Barbara guard Brian Shaw 
and three other more experienced bench players to spell the lethargic starters 
with trapping defense and jack-rabbit offense, Grandison is cheerleading more 
often than not. Even foot surgery that will sideline Larry Bird until March 
hasn't provided Grandison with decent playing time. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing I can do about the situation," Grandison said recently after 
practice at Hellenic College in Brookline, Mass. "I just have to keep myself 
ready and, when the time comes, produce." 
</P>
<P>
Grandison, who played on a St. Bernard team that featured Oregon State's Eric 
Knox, Cal's Leonard Taylor and former USC forward Rod Keller, would have reason 
to worry if this were last year. Former Celtics Coach K. C. Jones rarely used 
his bench -- and it showed. When forwards Brad Lohaus and Reggie Lewis came off 
the pine, Boston lost its edge. Neither the team nor the bench players 
benefited. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has been kicked upstairs and Rodgers is intent on getting significant 
contributions from more than his starting five. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we are using 9 or 10 and that is a lot, but that doesn't mean Ronnie 
won't enter into the picture," Rodgers said. "It is a long season and it's just 
hard to predict how the minutes are gonna fall." 
</P>
<P>
Some might say that merely becoming a Celtic is more than enough for Grandison 
to ask, that he shouldn't expect to have a uniform and play in it too. 
Shouldn't he just be thankful that he outplayed journeyman Ennis Whatley and 
third-round draft choice Gerald Paddio in the preseason? Hardly, says 
Grandison, who is logging more minutes on the bench than on Boston Garden's 
parquet floor. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the game is changing for the Celtics and for the whole league," 
Grandison said. "We played some games early in the season where we played 
really slow basketball and we just got run off the floor. They are gonna need 
young guys like me, Reggie (Lewis) and Brian (Shaw) who can keep up. The 
opportunity is there and if I just wait and be patient, it'll come." 
</P>
<P>
If Grandison, 24, could survive his rocky pre-NBA career, logic says he can 
make a living in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
He spent four years at St. Bernard and won a CIF 3-A Division championship in 
his senior year, when he averaged 14 points a game. But his basketball career 
deteriorated a year later. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging 6.1 points and 3.6 rebounds in 28 games in his freshman year at 
UC Irvine, Grandison expected to be a pivotal Anteater the following year. He 
felt more like an ant. He played in 29 games but never started and averaged 
just 4.4 points and 3.1 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I started out doing well but all of a sudden (Coach Bill) Mulligan sat me on 
the bench and kept me there, and I couldn't understand it," Grandison recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Grandison said Mulligan told him that his attitude was suspect, that five guys 
would play most that year and that Grandison was the sixth man. "I played 2-3 
minutes of every game the whole year. I accepted that role but it was like 
(Mulligan) still wanted to bring me down as a person, and I didn't accept 
that," Grandison said. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan recently remembered Grandison as a "front-line sub, a guy who would 
have started his last two years." The problem with Grandison, Mulligan said, 
was his patience. He didn't have enough for an underclassman. "We beat USC one 
night and that was a pretty big win around here, and the next day he came in 
bitching about playing time. It just got down to that," Mulligan said. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1983-84 season, according to Mulligan, Grandison and his 
mother Myra walked into Mulligan's office and told the coach that Ron was 
contemplating a transfer. "The deal with his mother -- I had a problem with him 
after that," Mulligan said, "but I think a guy like that can make it in the NBA 
as an 11th or 12th man. I don't think he'll ever be a starter." 
</P>
<P>
For the record, Myra Grandison believes her son has plenty of patience. Since 
he was a child, Myra said, Ron started at the bottom and worked his way up. 
Transferring out of UC Irvine, however, wasn't the quickest way to move up in 
basketball. Especially when Grandison decided to transfer to Tulane. At the 
time he was thinking more about academics than basketball: I didn't even look 
into basketball and that was a big mistake." 
</P>
<P>
The oversight proved painful. St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune helped Grandison 
obtain a scholarship to Tulane and joining a program led by John (Hot Rod) 
Williams seemed like a blessing. But within months, Grandison's new school was 
embroiled in a point-shaving scandal. Grandison, though unable to play because 
he had transferred and had to sit out a year, was still subpoenaed as a 
character witness. He never took the stand but soon was searching for a new 
school. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a weird year," Grandison said. "At first I was afraid the school was 
going on probation. I was really nervous. I had two years left and I wanted a 
chance to go to the NCAA tournament. On probation you don't get that chance. 
Then when they dropped the program, I was kind of relieved because it let the 
rest of us go and be eligible to play somewhere else immediately." 
</P>
<P>
He took recruiting visits to Washington, Arizona State, Memphis State and 
Loyola Marymount. Finally, he settled on the University of New Orleans and the 
Southern drawl of fatherly Coach Bennie Dees. Grandison had family in New 
Orleans, and once Dees became involved the cross-city move to UNO was simple. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronnie and I got so close," Dees, now Wyoming's coach, said by telephone. 
Since that first season, Grandison has twice stayed with Dees while traveling. 
"He is like one of my family," Dees said. 
</P>
<P>
Dees insists now that the day Grandison told him he was coming to New Orleans 
was the day New Orleans' basketball program turned around. After an 11-19 
season in 1985, UNO finished 16-12 in Grandison's first year. Its newest 
standout averaged 16.9 points and 9.7 rebounds. A year later, Grandison and 
current Washington Bullets reserve Ledale Eccles guided the Privateers to a 
26-4 finish and a berth in the NCAAs, where they lost to Alabama in the second 
round. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronnie is not a great talent," said Dees, "but he'll have a long career in the 
NBA because of his attitude and the way he works. He is the hardest working 
basketball player ever to be put on this earth." 
</P>
<P>
Dees must have known something. Following an impressive end to his college 
career, Grandison was drafted by the Denver Nuggets in the fifth round of the 
1987 draft. European basketball -- and the promise of a comfortable salary -- 
beckoned. But Grandison decided to pursue a job in the NBA, and although he was 
Denver's final cut that year, he didn't quit. He joined the Rochester, Minn., 
Flyers of the Continental Basketball Assn. Apparently the move paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, Denver invited Grandison to its 2-week mini-camp, as did the 
Milwaukee Bucks. Neither offered a contract. Then the Celtics called. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't even realize the Celtics knew he existed," said Myra Grandison, who 
reluctantly added that her longtime allegiance to the Lakers now rests with the 
Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
After impressing the Boston brain trust enough to win a job, Grandison 
continued the trend early in the season, averaging about 10 minutes a game. The 
Celtics, however, were losing. Rodgers tried to develop a consistent lineup and 
Grandison's playing time diminished. With 19 games under his belt, he was 
averaging just 2.2 points and 1.2 rebounds a game. But Rodgers is quick to 
discount the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy like Ronnie right now isn't playing as many minutes, but in my mind he 
is just as important as any other player because each day he challenges our 
people on the practice court," Rodgers said. "That means he is adding to and 
helping this basketball team develop, and that's extremely important." 
</P>
<P>
As it was earlier in Grandison's career, it's a question of patience. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good about the Celtics organization," Grandison said, "and I feel like 
maybe not this year but next year or the year after I will be a major 
contributor."

GARDNER, 81, RECALLS A GAME UPSTAGED BY WAR

<P>
Topics change often and easily during a conversation with Cletus (Biff) 
Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
One minute he offers insights into a 19-year career of officiating in the 
National Football League. The next, he offers a jar of homemade guava jam. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner, 81, helps Belle, his wife of 19 years, make gallons of the 
cherry-colored confection he loves to share. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it a beautiful color?" Gardner asked. A perfect match to his colorful 
life. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 17 years since Gardner retired from his county job as parks and 
recreation director, 47 years since he coached football at Sweetwater High 
School and 24 years since he was an NFL official. But he remembers it all 
vividly. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner founded and became the director of San Diego County Parks and 
Recreation in 1946, the same year he began his affiliation with the Hall of 
Champions, of which he is still the treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
As a linebacker and a fullback at Villanova, his college football experience 
was capped by an appearance on the Eastern team in the 1931 Shrine East-West 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time, that was a big game," Gardner said. "There weren't any other 
postseason games to play in, and it was really an honor. In effect, it was an 
All-American team." 
</P>
<P>
Upon graduating, Gardner had offers to play professionally but declined and 
headed to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"At the time," he said, "there was no real knowledge of how long (a 
professional career) would last, so I decided to coach." 
</P>
<P>
He took a job as the football coach at St. Augustine High (1931-1938), then 
moved to Sweetwater, where he coached the Red Devils from 1938 to the spring 
semester of 1942. During that time, he worked part-time as a football official 
in the semipro Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
As if it were yesterday, Gardner recalls a game in Balboa Stadium, where the 
PCL's Los Angeles Bulldogs were playing the San Diego Bombers on Dec. 7, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
"There were 32,000 people in the stands," he recalled. "During halftime, it was 
announced that the Japanese had just bombed Pearl Harbor. Within 25-30 minutes, 
over half the stadium had cleared out." 
</P>
<P>
Though past draft age, he enlisted in the Navy and served for 4 1/2 years, 
including a tour in New Caledonia. After the war, he was asked to officiate by 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a telegram in June of 1946," Gardner said. He's still unsure of how the 
NFL found him but is glad it did. His tenure stretched from 1946 to 1965, and 
he didn't miss a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
But he did miss work on Monday once. 
</P>
<P>
"I got stuck in Green Bay," Gardner explained. "Boy, what a place to get stuck. 
It was 22 below zero." 
</P>
<P>
Officials were told 10 days in advance where they would be working on Sunday, 
and it was their responsibility to get to the field on time. 
</P>
<P>
"We just had to be there by kickoff," Gardner said. "How we got there or where 
we stayed was our problem." 
</P>
<P>
For their services, officials were paid $50 for exhibition games and $100 for a 
regular game. 
</P>
<P>
Along with his full-time job with the county, Gardner would pull 
triple-headers, officiating a high school game on Friday, a college game on 
Saturday and the pros on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I had three different rule books," he said, "and three different game heads. 
I'd screw on a different head for each game." 
</P>
<P>
As an umpire, it was Gardner's duty to watch line play. He said calling 
infractions was a matter of instinct. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't realize," Gardner said, "that we have a reflex action. You 
watch, and you just know that there was something wrong on the play. You call 
it as you see it. You don't think, you just do it. By the time you see the flag 
bounce on the ground, you know what the call is. And you can't throw the flag 
back in your pocket and change your mind." 
</P>
<P>
Which brings Gardner to the touchy subject of instant replay, now being used by 
the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
To replay or not? 
</P>
<P>
He chuckles at the idea of those men in the press boxes, keeping tabs on the 
action with their fancy machines. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, when the Cleveland Browns were ousted from the first round of 
postseason play, controversy in the replay booth stirred the playoff pot. 
</P>
<P>
Gardner's first comments on the replay devices aren't kind. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't it nice to have second-guessers?" he said sarcastically. "Someone 5,000 
miles away from the play is calling it. Isn't it nice to photograph each and 
every play? In case you don't see it, it's nice to be able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
He then relents and admits it can undo otherwise irreparable damage. 
</P>
<P>
"If instant replay can avoid a colossal error," Gardner said, "then it's 
worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
He is quick to point out that it isn't used that much and that it's still in 
its infancy stages. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't reverse decisions on the field that much," he said. "And it hasn't 
been used long enough. You can't judge it on a season or two. Let's wait and 
see what happens after a few years." 
</P>
<P>
Gardner watches the games as most spectators do, on television. He said 
perspective of the play is distorted. 
</P>
<P>
"I am the last to criticize officials," he said. "Way up there, they have 
another view of it. You can't always get the right view on TV; you don't see a 
true angle of the play." 
</P>
<P>
He has made so many calls that none stick out as the most controversial of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever you are," he said, "you have the home rooters, and whatever your 
ruling on a close play, well it becomes controversial as far as they're 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
But he does remember one game in particular, in the late '40s at the Los 
Angeles Coliseum in front of 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"I called a foul on a player," Gardner said, "and that player proceeded to tell 
me, 'You little son-of-a-. . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon the officiating crew was huddled in the middle of the field. Fines for 
unsportsmanlike conduct and foul language then were levied per word, so 
officials were arguing if the final part of the insult was a single, hyphenated 
word or not. At $100 a word, was it a $300 fine or $600? 
</P>
<P>
"Here we were," Gardner said with a laugh, "in the heat of the battle, and we 
were out there discussing grammar. I told the player, 'Look, I'm giving you a 
break. It's one word, so that's a $300 fine, a 15-yard penalty and you're out 
of the game.' " 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Gardner has seen the game evolve in specific ways. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he said, "they're throwing more passes and fake passes. They're not 
running as much, my guess is. There's more emphasis on the aerial game." 
</P>
<P>
And the calls haven't evolved much. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gardner: "Holding on the line, offsides, pass interference, as long as the 
game is played, they'll still be doing that. I see no difference in the way 
they're calling the game. It's still the same rule book."

MEEK LEADS SAN PASQUAL

<P>
A year ago, the San Pasqual High School boys' basketball team struggled to a 
4-18 record with a team anchored by a freshman center who had trouble getting 
up and down the floor for 32 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that 6-foot 9-inch Erik Meek couldn't run -- he could -- but at age 
15, he just didn't have the stamina. 
</P>
<P>
However, after an off-season of running, lifting weights and playing against 
some of the nation's best high-school players, Meek is running longer and San 
Pasqual is playing its best basketball in 2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, in an Avocado League-opening 91-66 rout of visiting San 
Marcos, Meek had 29 points, 11 rebounds and 2 blocks for San Pasqual (1-0, 
4-5). 
</P>
<P>
"He's the key to our offense," senior guard Andy Loveland said. "When they pack 
it in on him, we hit some shots from the outside and it opens up in the middle. 
We look to get the ball in the middle -- basically just throw it up. He's so 
tall, he can get a hand on it." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos displayed a half-court trap defense early in the game and San 
Pasqual shredded it, making 14 of 21 first-quarter shots en route to a 31-3 
first-quarter lead. Meek scored 9 points in the period. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the court, San Marcos (0-1, 4-7) had trouble going inside 
because of Meek's forbidding presence. Forced to shoot from the outside, San 
Marcos made just 1 of 14 first-quarter shots. Meek was there to grab 4 rebounds 
in the quarter and each time, his crisp outlet pass led to a layup. 
</P>
<P>
"Erik is a wonderful outlet passer," San Pasqual Coach Tom Buck said. "He loves 
to throw the outlet pass and get the break going." JEFFREY PARENTI

ARCHITECTURE STUDENTS DRAW LESSONS FROM BOOK OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, Whiteson is a Los Angeles architecture critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Practical Applications of Architecture 101: Class focuses on the comfort and 
concerns of people who actually live, play or work in various buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students at Burbank's Woodbury University won't find Practical Applications of 
Architecture 101 listed in the course catalogue, but Don Conway says the 
curriculum was designed with human and social needs in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Most design schools that teach architecture treat it either as a fine art or a 
sort of quasi-engineering," said Conway, director of the 5-year program at 
Woodbury leading to a bachelor of architecture degree. 
</P>
<P>
"In the typical approach to teaching design, the users of architecture are all 
too often the forgotten ones." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbury, Conway said, concentrates on architecture as an applied social 
science. According to the school catalogue, "Self-expression, while encouraged, 
is viewed as subordinate to the larger human issues with which architecture 
deals." 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum combines applied social science with a strong base in business 
practice and computer-aided design (CAD) technology. The university's 
well-equipped computer labs, which, according to Conway, are the most 
up-to-date in the United States on an undergraduate level, familiarize students 
from the first year on with the powerful new tool of three-dimensional software 
design programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Most architecture schools give a perfunctory course in CAD technology at the 
end of their course," Conway said. "In addition, few schools teach architects 
how to run their own offices as an efficient business proposition. The result 
is that many architects are not only computer-illiterate, they also fail to 
make a decent living." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Still Feeling Its Way' 
</P>
<P>
Conway admitted that his 4-year-old architecture program, with 170 students, is 
"still feeling its way." Woodbury University as a whole has had to overcome a 
longstanding reputation as a glorified secretarial school. 
</P>
<P>
The school was founded in 1884 by F.C. Woodbury as a college of business 
administration. The private nonprofit institution added a division of 
"professional arts" in 1931, a few years before the college moved into the 
Wilshire Boulevard building it occupied for 50 years, before relocating to 
Burbank last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now occupying the 22.4-acre former campus of the Cabrini School for Girls on 
Glenoaks Boulevard, Woodbury University includes the San Fernando Valley's 
first and only fully accredited architecture school. 
</P>
<P>
"Our move to Burbank is highly significant for us in several ways," Conway 
said. "We now have a spacious campus with plenty of spare room to expand, and 
we see our design school as a major resource for the Valley itself." 
</P>
<P>
In the year it has occupied its new campus buildings, the Woodbury architecture 
program has already established strong links with the Valley chapter of the 
American Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
Awarded a minority outreach grant by the Washington-based headquarters of the 
AIA, Woodbury is collaborating with the local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
"With the aid of the SFV/AIA, we help minority students who might not otherwise 
imagine that an architecture degree is within their grasp make the grade," 
Conway said. "This is a vital service to the community if architecture is not 
to be forever a profession open only to the privileged." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbury also grants loans and scholarships to help its less affluent students 
pay the school's $6,000 annual tuition fee. 
</P>
<P>
"We have high hopes of Woodbury," said Mark Smith, president of the SFV/AIA. 
"The Valley has many special architectural challenges that need to be 
confronted by academics and practicing professionals working together. As the 
Valley evolves from a collection of dormitory suburbs into a more self-focused 
constellation of cities, local designers need to be able to call upon the 
resources of our own institutions." 
</P>
<P>
Woodbury has also been involved in joint studies with other Los Angeles area 
architecture schools of social problems such as housing the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 joint study on temporary shelter for homeless families in suburbs linked 
Woodbury with the UCLA School of Architecture and Urban Planning and the Santa 
Monica-based Southern California Institute of Architecture. And it revealed the 
different design approaches favored by the three schools. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas the UCLA architecture and planning students tended to be concerned with 
the visual fit of the temporary shelter with its suburban street, and the SCI 
team was engaged in a search for aesthetically radical responses to the 
problem, Woodbury students explored the emotional and physical needs of the 
families that would use the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"The Woodbury approach was unlike the others," UCLA professor Jackie Leavitt 
observed at the time. "They had a more immediately humane response to the 
program than students from the other two schools. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that we all had a lot to learn from one another's very different 
mind-sets." 
</P>
<P>
The Woodbury architectural mind-set has not been easy to encourage, Conway 
said. Students and faculty take a while to come to terms with the notion of 
architecture as an applied social science. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a struggle to implant and implement our design philosophy," he 
said. "Since only three of our faculty are full-time -- the remainder are 
practicing professionals -- the old idea of architecture as fine art first dies 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess we all know that the quickest way to make a mark as an architectural 
superstar is to be a radical design hotshot. The responsibility to social 
concerns is a much slower, if more honorable, career path." 
</P>
<P>
Conway said that Woodbury's advantage as a very new architecture school was its 
freedom from "cultural baggage." Woodbury -- "small, private and expensive" -- 
has had a chance to redefine the notion of user-responsive design, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As an instance of the social sensitivity of the Woodbury approach, Conway 
points to a recent project, by third-year student Carolyn Glassier, to design 
an expansion of the Bette Ripp Women's Center on downtown L.A.'s Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all deeply impressed by her real understanding of the clientele which 
the Women's Center serves," wrote center Executive Director Maurice Martinez. 
"Her compassion and understanding are reflected in the plan, including her use 
of space, light and form." 
</P>
<P>
The Women's Center plans to adopt Glasier's scheme as a basis for its 
expansion, and will use the design in starting a capital campaign for the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get more socially applied than that," Conway said, with pride.

THE NEW: FANNY PACKS AND FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taking a hint from cyclists, skiers and campers, the street-wise are wearing 
fanny packs -- also known as belt pouches, hip packs and walking packs. They 
come in a wide range of sizes, shapes and colors, and hold everything from 
portable phones, Walkmans and walkie-talkies to small change, wallets, 
mid-shopping-day lunches or paperbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Lieberman, manager at Oshman's, says his fanny packs "are a very big 
item," especially popular with people traveling to Europe. A few years ago, 
Lieberman only saw campers buying them, but today the packs are popular for 
everyday use. 
</P>
<P>
Made by several manufacturers, including Outdoor Products, JanSport and Caribou 
Mountaineering, the packs range in price from $4.99 to $19.99. They are 
generally made of heavyweight nylon; some have multiple exterior pockets. 
</P>
<P>
Says Art Heller, buyer at the Surprise Store in Tarzana: "We sell them to 
everyone, from kids going to camp to 70-year-old men and women who wear them 
when they walk." Some people fill the fanny packs with weights for a heightened 
workout, says Heller, whose store "sells a lot of them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The fanny packs are hard to misplace, lightweight and probably more resistant 
to theft than are purses or other pouches that are not strapped to the body. 
</P>
<P>
According to one woman walking down Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks: "It 
leaves my hands free for other things."

CRITIC AT LARGE: THEY NEVER PROMISED HIM A ROSE GARDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, Times Arts Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In one of the classic murder mysteries, it turns out to be the judge who done 
it. The author obviously played on the surprise generated by the fact that 
judges are presumed to be innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Judges may assign guilt and innocence right and left, but up there on the bench 
they are understood to be themselves blameless and without sin. Not true, of 
course, and, as I should have realized before, there is a certain delight being 
able to sit in judgment on a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Judging the Miss America contest sounds like heaven to any healthy male, until 
he realizes that he has found a sure-fire way to make dozens of gorgeous women 
angry at him with a flick of the pencil, and in the process has convinced 
millions of equally healthy males that they could have chosen better than he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
When I agreed to be one of the three judges of this year's centennial 
Tournament of Roses parade, it did not occur to me that we could be 
second-guessed by half a million on-the-spot witnesses and an additional 300 
million or so elsewhere on the globe. 
</P>
<P>
But one newspaper, after canvassing a handful of parade-watchers, quickly 
concluded that we and they must have been watching different parades. The fact 
that the curb-side watchers could not agree among themselves on the worst 
mistakes the judges had made was some slight consolation. 
</P>
<P>
What also hadn't occurred to me was what hard work judging 55 flower-draped 
floats was going to be. The Tournament of Roses is fiendishly well-organized, 
with a century's worth of experience codified into do's and don'ts, as the 
recent series in The Times indicated. The tournament could probably give 
organizational lessons to Ma Bell, IBM and the Masons. 
</P>
<P>
Our hosts gathered us up at 6 a.m. on Saturday for a 12-hour tour of the 
construction sites, which stretch from Glendale to Downey and which were damp 
and chilly last weekend. We took a second look Sunday on another 12-hour day, 
again beginning at 6 a.m., noting the progress as the floats flexed their 
animated muscles and thickened with blooms. 
</P>
<P>
We'd hardly finished when we were picked up again at 2:30 Monday morning for a 
final look at the floats, now in their parade positions in the eerie, 
floodlighted darkness along Orange Grove Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Six hours later, when the parade passed our sleepless eyes, we three judges 
winced a couple of times (at least) for the floats we wished we could have 
honored. 
</P>
<P>
You'd think with 18 trophies to be spread among 55 floats you'd surely be able 
to salute all the deserving entries. But like any art form -- and designing 
floral-decorated floats is an art form, however you rank it with sculpture and 
needlepoint -- this kind of design does not stand pat; it progresses. There was 
a lot of good work to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
Computers, advanced hydraulics and miniaturized motors are now part of the 
float vocabulary. The Casablanca Fan Co. float (out of competition because of 
its immense size), with skiers doing midair loops, is a very far cry from the 
flower-covered carriages of the first parade. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, technologies aside, the shaping hand of the designing artist is still what 
matters, and the best floats, so we concluded, were not necessarily large or 
costly (although they could be both) but were simply very beautiful. The parade 
theme, "Celebration 100," was broadly interpreted and one of the most striking 
floats celebrated the whale and other endangered sea species. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise, I think, was how much of its originating impulse the Rose Parade 
still retains. Despite the fact that the tournament has become a very big (if 
nonprofit) business and that the grandest floats represent corporate 
investments of $100,000 easily, there is no substitute for the thousands of 
hours of volunteer labor. (The volunteers at the commercial firms are paid but 
are often earning money for their churches, schools and charities.) 
</P>
<P>
There are still the modest self-built entries from the surrounding cities like 
Burbank, Sierra Madre and La Canada Flintridge, and it was a special pleasure 
to be able to honor one of those floats for its spritely wit. 
</P>
<P>
The danger to the parade, as to many aspects of American life, is the 
distending, distorting pressure of commercialism and television. 
</P>
<P>
The television coverage began with a 15-minute mini-revue before the grandstand 
that struck me as television at its variety-show dreariest, awkward, corny 
dialogue and all, despite the fact that the attractive young singers and 
dancers were locals -- from Cypress College. It wasn't Pasadena and it wasn't 
the Rose Parade, and while some sort of kick off moment isn't a bad idea, 
another year it ought not to suggest "Follies" on an off night. 
</P>
<P>
The parade reprises some of the elements in American life now deemed to be in 
short supply: community spirit, collaborative effort, the beauty of natural 
things (when they have not been completely chopped, ground and reworked for 
purposes of illustration) and a sense of innocence and good humor, silly as the 
jokes sometimes are. 
</P>
<P>
At their best, the floats are worth a fervent "gee whiz!" and there are not as 
many honest "gee whizzes" around as there might be. 
</P>
<P>
My fellow judges, Pasadena artist Helen Pashgian and C. Wade Roberts, chief 
horticulturist at the Sherman Gardens and Library in Corona del Mar, have 
doubtless been reminded, as I have, of the biblical injunction "judge not, lest 
you be judged." We should probably have thought of that sooner, but then we 
would have missed a remarkable experience.

BYRDS BATTLE FOR THE RIGHTS TO THE NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How many Byrds does it take to make a band fly? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to that riddle depends on which of the five original members of the 
acclaimed, Los Angeles-based '60s folk-rock group you ask -- and it ultimately 
may depend on what a judge has to say concerning federal trademark law. 
</P>
<P>
Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman think the answer, at least for 
now, should be three. Their aim in playing together as the Byrds for three 
Southland club dates this week -- their first billing as Byrds in 15 years -- 
is to establish their legal right to control the name Byrds as a registered 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
By controlling the name, they hope to stop what they see as its improper use 
over the last few years by the two other original Byrds, Gene Clark and Michael 
Clarke, less well-known musicians who since 1985 have toured together or 
individually under the Byrds banner. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Clark and Clarke, however, said Tuesday that both musicians 
are considering legal action to stop the others from reserving the name for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who plans to begin touring next month as "The Byrds featuring Michael 
Clarke," thinks one original member -- himself -- is enough to justify putting 
the Byrds name on a marquee. A drummer who neither sang nor wrote songs for the 
Byrds, Clarke said he already has begun steps to register Byrds as his own 
trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who made important vocal and songwriting contributions in the band's 
early days but was the first original member to leave the group, said that only 
a full-fledged reunion of the original lineup should be allowed to hold the 
Byrds trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking from his home in Spokane, Wash., Clarke said that touring under the 
Byrds name in recent years gives him a greater legal claim on it than McGuinn, 
Crosby and Hillman, who haven't been billed as Byrds since a 1973 one-shot 
reunion album featuring all five original members. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give up your name for 15 years, it's anybody's name," Clarke said. "I 
feel if you're a part of something in the beginning, then you're a part of it 
forever. I'm not the kind of person who gets denied a living or likes to be 
harassed. If this goes into a full (legal) battle, may the best Byrd win." 
</P>
<P>
Without elaborating, Clark said in a separate interview that the controversy 
over use of the Byrds name "has become a legal matter." But Clark also said he 
doesn't want to use the name by himself, and that he stopped touring as a lone 
Byrd last summer because he didn't think it was proper. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't comfortable having it be the Byrds," he said. "But (touring 
under the Byrds name) was an opportunity that wasn't available to me in any 
other way. When I got things back on the road for my own solo career, I figured 
if the other guys don't want me to use the name, then I don't think it's the 
right thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing would be for the five people to sit down and come to some sort 
of agreement (to re-form the original band)," Clark continued. "At least a few 
hundred thousand people would love to see the original Byrds, and (in light of 
the band's 25th anniversary this year), to give it to them right now would be 
the prime time." 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman see Byrds tours led by the other original members 
as rump versions of the band that can only hurt its legacy. 
</P>
<P>
"Last thing I heard, they were playing at a lounge in Vegas," Hillman said in 
an interview last September, well before the current controversy developed. 
"That's the ultimate insult. It just drags it in the mud." 
</P>
<P>
This week's Byrds' dates -- Wednesday at the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano, tonight at the Bacchanal in San Diego and Friday at the Ventura 
Theatre -- don't herald an ongoing re-formation of the band, according to 
McGuinn, although he said that is an eventual possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the shows are a hastily organized tactical move intended to bolster 
McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman's efforts to stake a legal claim to the Byrds name 
by showing that they are actively in business as the Byrds. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby's manager, Bill Siddons, who organized the current dates, said McGuinn 
is the only Byrd with the conceivable right to claim the group name for his 
sole use. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn, the only member to stay with the band from its formation in 1964 to 
its final breakup in 1973 after many personnel changes, is generally regarded 
as the most important shaper of the Byrds' signature harmonies and ringing 
12-string guitar sound. Until recently, McGuinn had said he had no intention of 
resurrecting the Byrds. 
</P>
<P>
A reunion of all five original Byrds would be a lucrative proposition. Judging 
from their comments, the less prominent Clark and Clarke are keen to tap that 
demand, while McGuinn said that using a Byrds reunion to reap a windfall "is 
not where I'm coming from." 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn's recording career has been on hold through most of the '80s, but he 
continues to tour steadily as a solo act, and says his autobiography is due to 
be published later this year. Crosby has been busy since his comeback from drug 
addiction with a recently published autobiography, an album with Crosby, 
Stills, Nash &amp; Young, and an upcoming solo album. Hillman has built a solid 
country music following with his Desert Rose Band. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of a hospital benefit in San Jose have offered $500,000 for a single 
performance by the original Byrds lineup this August at a 30,000-seat college 
football stadium. Clark, Clarke and Hillman accepted, according to Kathy 
Goldwyn, one of the proposed event's organizers, but Crosby and McGuinn did not 
respond. But, Hillman's wife, Connie, said Tuesday that his OK was not given 
seriously because he doubted it was a realistic offer. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody says they're going to do a benefit and pay you $500,000 -- Chris 
has been in the business long enough to know those dollars are way out of the 
stratosphere," said Mrs. Hillman, who is one of Elton John's managers. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the offer is firm, said Siddons, Crosby's manager, accepting it would 
tarnish the Byrds' legacy by turning their reunion into a pure money grab. 
</P>
<P>
"The Byrds mattered," he said. "I think playing a stadium date on your return 
after 15 years without a record is just the wrong thing to do. They have to 
rebuild a little bit of their legend first. It's critical that we establish the 
quality and importance of the band before we think about the money. My hope is 
that this goes well enough so the Byrds will regroup and forgive each other. I 
know it is in the cards for that to happen."

BRANIFF TO ADD 50 AIRLINERS TO FLEET IN $3.5-BILLION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT E. DALLOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Braniff, in an effort to quickly re-enter the major leagues of the U.S. airline 
business, said Wednesday that it will add 50 Airbus Industrie jets to its fleet 
and take options on 50 more in a deal valued at $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas-based carrier, a pioneer of the airline industry that has been 
struggling since it emerged from bankruptcy in 1984 and resumed flying, is 
obtaining the rights to the initial 50 aircraft by paying $115 million to 
cash-strapped Pan American World Airways, which had ordered them originally. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff arranged to obtain the European-made airliners, according to its 
chairman, William G. McGee, because it could get them far more quickly than it 
could get comparable planes from another manufacturer, backlogged Boeing of 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The airline, which is building up a major hub in Kansas City, will not buy the 
airliners but will lease most of them from three other companies: the 
manufacturer, the engine maker and another firm. 
</P>
<P>
"When the opportunity came along" to obtain the rights to the A320s that Pan 
American had ordered, McGee said in an interview after a news conference here, 
"it placed us in a situation to considerably move our expansion forward. This 
was a wonderful opportunity. If we had ordered from Boeing, we would have had 
to wait till at least 1993." 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Braniff will take delivery of the first 10 planes next year. 
</P>
<P>
For Pan American, the deal provides a badly needed cash windfall. Jeffrey 
Kriendler, a spokesman for Pan American said it is a "win, win, win situation 
for everybody. The sale gives us a very substantial cash infusion, which we 
will use to continue our recovery plan." 
</P>
<P>
He said the A320 is not suited to Pan American's current route structure, 
adding that the airline is purchasing some Airbus Industrie A310s, which have a 
longer range and can fly across the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Pan American's original order, which Braniff will assume, involved firm orders 
for 16 planes and options for 34 more. However, Braniff is making all 50 firm 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
McGee said the 50 planes will be acquired over a six-year period, with the 
first two to be put into service next July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First to Order 
</P>
<P>
Financing for 42 airliners has been committed by GPA Group Ltd., a major 
airplane leasing company based in Ireland; IAE International Aero Engines, the 
engine supplier for the planes, and by Airbus itself. Airbus is an aircraft 
manufacturing consortium made up of French, British, West German and Spanish 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
The financing for the remaining eight aircraft must be arranged later by 
Braniff. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Pan American became the first American airline to order the A320. 
Northwest Airlines ordered 100 the next year. All told, according to Airbus, 
about 700 orders have been placed worldwide for the A320. 
</P>
<P>
The two-engine plane will seat 148 passengers in a first-class and coach 
configuration and has a range of about 3,000 miles when fully loaded. Braniff, 
which does not now have first-class sections, will reinstitute them in an 
effort to attract more business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
McGee, who joined Braniff six months ago after resigning as chairman of 
Piedmont Airlines, said Braniff ultimately plans a fleet of 171 airliners, 
compared to the 53 it now has. There have been reports that Braniff will 
acquire a number of Boeing 737s from American Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff got a shot in the arm in October when Eastern Airlines, which had 
operated a major hub in Kansas City, pulled all but six daily flights from the 
airport there. Braniff, which had 50 flights a day in and out of the hub when 
the new management took over last year, now has 83 daily and expects to 
increase the number to 100 this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Rapid Expansion 
</P>
<P>
Braniff is named for its founder, Thomas Braniff, who launched it in the 
barnstorming days of the late 1920s and early 1930s. In the mid-1960s, Braniff 
planes were painted in bright colors, and one DC-8 jet on a Latin American 
route was painted in a wavy pattern designed by artist Alexander Calder. 
</P>
<P>
After having several owners since it emerged from bankruptcy, Braniff is 
controlled by Bia-cor Holdings, a corporation controlled by the CoreGroup, a 
Philadelphia-based investor group. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff International, as it was called then, expanded its routes and fleet too 
quickly after airline deregulation in 1978 and collapsed on May 12, 1982, under 
a debt load of about $1 billion. At that time it had 82 planes. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Marckesano, airline analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, a Philadelphia 
brokerage house, said Wednesday that he is worried that Braniff might again be 
expanding too quickly. "If so, Braniff could fall on its face," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But McGee said the company is operating "cautiously and carefully and is not on 
the kind of track it once was." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Braniff within 18 months would again be one of the nation's 
so-called major airlines, which means that it would have annual revenue of more 
than $1 billion. "We expect to have this company profitable by the end of 
1989," he added.

CHAIRMAN TRIES TO DRIVE OFF FORD FAMILY'S DISCONTENT

Ford Motor Chairman Donald Petersen, faced with a surprising new challenge to 
his authority from a younger generation of Ford family members, stood his 
ground Wednesday, suggesting that the time for family control over the 
management of the world's second-largest auto maker is past. 
</P>
<P>
In his first meeting with the press since reports surfaced that the younger 
members of the Ford family -- which still controls 40% of the company's voting 
shares -- want more influence in the company, Petersen stressed that he 
believes Ford should stick with professional, non-family management. 
</P>
<P>
"We are now in a position where I believe . . . decisions as to who will serve 
as the chief executive of Ford will be based on a judgment of who is in the 
best position to do that job in the best possible way," said Petersen, choosing 
his words carefully and diplomatically. "Ultimately, when it comes to chief 
executives, our belief at Ford Motor Co. . . . is that decision is one that 
should be based on merit." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Petersen, only the second non-family member to run the giant auto maker, 
also made it clear that he is trying to negotiate a deal with the family. He 
says he thinks he can satisfy the demands of the fourth generation of Ford 
family members -- the sons and daughters of Henry Ford II and his two brothers 
and one sister -- for increased influence inside the company, without 
disrupting the non-family management structure that has engineered Ford's 
dramatic recovery over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic that we will work out an approach as we proceed here, 
between the family's fourth generation and the Ford Motor Co., that will be 
very favorable to both the family and the company's interests," Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
Standing quietly by as Petersen spoke to reporters at a press preview for the 
North American International Auto Show here was Edsel B. Ford II, a 
Lincoln-Mercury marketing executive and the 40-year-old son of Henry Ford II. 
Edsel Ford refused to comment on the situation Wednesday and cheerfully joined 
Petersen in front of Lincoln-Mercury cars for the benefit of a crowd of 
photographers at the auto show. 
</P>
<P>
But Edsel and his cousin, 31-year-old William (Billy) Clay Ford Jr., who runs 
Ford's Swiss sales operations, are reportedly leading the campaign by the 
fourth generation of Ford family members to regain at least some of the 
influence that the family has lost since Henry Ford II retired as chairman of 
Ford in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
That family influence declined further after Henry Ford II died in 1987. Even 
after his retirement, he retained enormous influence and remained chairman of 
the board's powerful finance committee until his death. That post has been 
given to his brother, William Clay Ford Sr. -- Billy's father. But while he 
also holds the title of vice chairman, William Clay Sr. doesn't play nearly as 
active a role inside the company as did his brother, preferring instead to be 
involved with the Detroit Lions, the National Football League team that he 
owns. 
</P>
<P>
Edsel and Billy sparked the current controversy by going public with their 
frustrations over their lack of influence in the company. Although they are 
both on the board -- despite holding rather junior executive positions -- the 
two Fords have told reporters that they feel that Petersen is trying to limit 
their power. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Edsel, who apparently now hopes someday to be chief executive, 
complained to Fortune magazine that he and Billy are the only two board members 
not assigned to any of the board's committees. 
</P>
<P>
Some family members, including some of the younger Ford women who do not work 
at the company, also apparently want a fourth seat on the board, joining Edsel, 
Billy and William Clay Sr. 
</P>
<P>
To improve their bargaining power at the company, the Ford family members are 
apparently trying to work jointly to keep their strong voting control over Ford 
stock. They have set up a fund to buy any stock that might be sold by family 
members in an effort to retain the 40% voting power provided their special 
Class B Ford family stock. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to the potential power of a Ford family voting block, Petersen is 
clearly trying to tread lightly, while still guarding his turf. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very clear that we are a company in transition in our relationship with 
the Ford family," Petersen said. "We've gone from working with essentially a 
third generation, to now, where there is a growing involvement of the fourth 
generation. The fourth generation of the Ford family is coming of age, if you 
will. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, we are plowing new ground. We've never been here before. So we're 
having a lot of discussions about it in a very informal way -- continuing 
conversations. Many of those conversations are among Bill (William Clay Sr.), 
Edsel, Billy and me."

FDIC CALLS FOR BROAD CHANGES IN S &amp; L RULES TO PREVENT CRISES

The federal government should be allowed to stop insuring deposits at badly run 
savings and loan institutions, the nation's top banking regulator said 
Wednesday as he estimated that taxpayers might have to contribute as much as 
$115 billion to rescue failed S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"The system must be changed if we are going to (continue to) have deposit 
insurance," said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid financial crises, the federal insurance fund for S&amp;Ls should 
operate like a private company, able to raise rates based on experience and to 
terminate coverage, Seidman told reporters, as his agency released a major 
study, "Deposit Insurance for the Nineties." 
</P>
<P>
He also called for more freedom for banks to enter new lines of business and to 
seek capital from other industries. Because S&amp;Ls already have this freedom, 
their advantage over banks "bastardizes" the nation's financial system, Seidman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Hearing Sought 
</P>
<P>
In another development Wednesday, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.), angered by federal regulators' "rush to close billions of 
dollars" in savings and loan rescue packages last month, said he will summon 
officials for a special investigative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Numerous questions" have been raised about the hasty completion of deals in 
the last days of 1988 when special tax benefits were still available, Gonzalez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want you to be prepared to give the committee an estimate of the total tax 
benefits as well as a breakdown for each individual deal," Gonzalez said in a 
letter to M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Seidman, 
meanwhile, said the S&amp;L insurance fund must be separate from the bank 
board, which has the mission of regulating the S&amp;L industry and promoting 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
The nation needs independent "insurers whose primary interest is in maintaining 
a safe system and a safe insurance fund," he said. "We believe when that gets 
mixed up with other duties, such as promoting housing . . . it tends to weaken 
the insurer's resolve to protect his fund." 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers will bear the heaviest burden of restoring the health of the 
S&amp;L insurance fund, Seidman said. As recently as November, he had suggested 
that the price tag might range from $50 billion to $100 billion. On Wednesday, 
however, he boosted the FDIC's estimate to a range of $60 billion to $115 
billion, the highest figures offered by any government official. The potential 
cost of the rescue keeps growing because the crippled S&amp;Ls suffer 
continuing losses each month. And there is little sign of recovery in the 
prices of depressed real estate properties held by financially ailing S&amp;Ls 
in Texas, where most of the losses are concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Plan Endorsed 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. protects deposits up to $100,000 
at S&amp;Ls, just as Seidman's FDIC guarantees bank deposits up to $100,000. 
The crisis has arisen because the FSLIC does not have enough cash to close the 
insolvent institutions and pay off the depositors. There is no threat to 
customers because Congress has previously declared that it will protect 
deposits with the "full faith and credit" of the United States. This 
declaration provides the security needed to avert any run on the S&amp;Ls by 
nervous depositors. 
</P>
<P>
While depositors are reassured, Congress faces the difficult task of finding 
the billions of dollars needed to restore the insurance fund without worsening 
the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC study did not endorse a specific plan, although it said the budget 
impact could be minimized by some form of borrowing. A specially created agency 
could borrow the funds, with the Treasury guaranteeing the bonds issued by this 
agency and paying the interest. Only the interest would be counted against the 
budget deficit, the study said. One of Seidman's predecessors as head of the 
FDIC, William Isaac, recently suggested the use of the healthy bank insurance 
fund to provide financial help for the beleaguered S&amp;L insurance fund. 
However, Seidman unequivocally rejects this idea. The FDIC's cash "should not 
be used due to the risk of leaving the agency with insufficient funds to 
fulfill its function," the FDIC report said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Done Without Money' 
</P>
<P>
Seidman believes that the S&amp;L problem is too massive to be solved by 
diverting funds from the bank insurance system or by calling on banks to pay 
additional insurance premiums to help the S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Offering a barbed compliment, Seidman said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has 
become "the king of bailout agencies in the government." 
</P>
<P>
"We're very happy to send Danny the congratulations and to note that he did it 
without money," said Seidman, referring to the blizzard of year-end deals by 
Wall, the bank board chairman, to find outside investors for the crippled 
S&amp;Ls. The bank board relied on notes and guarantees against future losses 
to attract needed capital. 
</P>
<P>
"I am green with envy looking at the buyers our friends up the street can get 
for their institutions," Seidman said, referring to the barrage of December 
deals arranged by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, whose offices are a block 
away from the FDIC headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Among the S&amp;L investors are a thrift unit of Ford Motor and Texas 
billionaire Robert M. Bass. Many would-be investors "cannot buy our banks 
because of rules separating commerce and banking," Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it makes any sense" to persist in separating banks and other 
businesses that would like to invest in banking, he said. Giving S&amp;Ls 
powers and investors denied to banks may help S&amp;Ls in the short run, but in 
the long run it "bastardizes" the financial system, Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Total Value of Tax Benefits 
</P>
<P>
The tax breaks given to buyers of the failed S&amp;Ls apparently "run into the 
billions of dollars," said Rep. David Dreier (R-La Verne), a member of 
Gonzalez's Banking Committee. "There was a small investment by a small group of 
people, helped by a huge infusion of tax dollars." 
</P>
<P>
The tax benefit of acquiring a loss-ridden S&amp;L was cut in half by changes 
in the tax law taking effect Jan. 1. The losses from the S&amp;L can be applied 
against other income to reduce the tax burden of the business investor 
acquiring the S&amp;L. But the changes in the law made it imperative to 
complete the deals before the end of 1988 to enjoy the maximum tax benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Bank board officials said Wednesday that they had not completed calculating the 
total value of the tax benefits and the resulting loss to the U.S. Treasury. 
They refused to provide a general estimate of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit varies with each transaction, depending on the losses of a 
particular S&amp;L, and the profits of the firm that buys the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
The tax breaks were important components in the complex packages assembled by 
bank board officials and outside investors during marathon negotiating sessions 
late in December. The bank board, which does not have enough cash in the 
federal insurance fund to close crippled S&amp;Ls, used notes and guarantees 
against future losses to attract outside investors to buy the S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez said in the letter to Wall that the committee wants to know: 
</P>
<P>
* The total cost to the insurance fund of all December transactions. 
</P>
<P>
* The source of money to pay for these commitments. 
</P>
<P>
* The capital furnished by each buyer. 
</P>
<P>
* The cost of any alternatives to the aid packages and the "reasons for 
rejection of the alternatives."

KEEBLER LIGHTENS UP ON ITS TROPICAL OILS; 
</P>
<P>
SNACK FOOD MAKER JOINS OTHER MANUFACTURERS THAT ARE BOWING TO PRESSURE FROM 
CONSUMERS TO GET SATURATED FATS OUT OF THEIR PRODUCTS. 
</P>

Keebler Co. joined a group of major food companies Wednesday in announcing that 
it is taking steps to eliminate tropical oils -- such as coconut, palm and palm 
kernel oils -- from its products, after an unusually aggressive consumer 
campaign against saturated fats found to contribute to high cholesterol levels. 
</P>
<P>
Keebler said it is the first major snack food manufacturer to commit to a 
reformulation of its entire product line -- eliminating animal fats as well -- 
in response to consumer concerns about cholesterol. The company also said it 
would begin providing complete nutritional information on its labels. The 
Elmhurst, Ill.-based company said it is acting on the consensus of health 
authorities that the consumption of certain vegetable oils high in saturated 
fat cause the body to produce more cholesterol than it needs, contributing to 
the risk of heart disease. The reformulated products will begin to appear in 
grocery stores in March, Keebler said. 
</P>
<P>
Keebler has about $1 billion in retail sales annually, mostly in the United 
States. The company, which would not give the cost of the reformulation, said 
it would not affect consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows a series of high-profile newspaper ads placed by the 
National Heart Savers Assn. in the nation's largest circulation newspapers 
attacking several major food companies for their use of coconut and palm oils. 
The association accused the companies of "poisoning" America and misleading the 
public in the use of the oils, which contain no cholesterol, but which help 
cholesterol form after consumption. 
</P>
<P>
The food companies, however, may be stirring another controversy among health 
experts about how much dietary changes actually decrease cholesterol. Some 
health officials point out that tropical oils are a negligible contributor to 
cholesterol in American diet and that the main culprit is animal fats. 
</P>
<P>
The Heart Savers campaign was unusual in the swiftness of the response on the 
part of food companies. One week after the ads, Sunshine Biscuits Inc. of 
Woodbridge, N.J. -- the maker of Hydrox cookies -- said it would remove palm 
oil and palm kernel oil from its cookie and cracker products. The company said 
it had been planning the action for several months. Pepperidge Farm of Norwalk, 
Conn., also said it would remove coconut oil from its crackers and cookies -- 
including the popular "Original Goldfish" -- by summer. Kellogg Co. of Battle 
Creek, Mich., which was blasted for promoting the supposedly 
cholesterol-reducing properties of the bran in its Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal 
while using tropical oils in the cereal, also said it would eliminate the oils. 
Keebler also said Wednesday that it had been working on reformulating its 
products for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
The oils are used extensively in food formulas because of their taste, texture 
and ability to lengthen shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
Nabisco Brands, a unit of RJR Nabisco, said it has several products without 
tropical oils -- including Almost Home Cookies and the new Ritz Bits. The 
company has been testing formulas for all products, including Oreo Cookies, 
which still have saturated fats, said spokeswoman Caroline Fee. "But the taste 
of Oreos is almost sacred. We have to make sure that we don't alter the taste," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Sokolof, the 65-year-old self-made millionaire from Omaha, Neb., who 
founded the Heart Savers Assn., was ecstatic Wednesday after the Keebler 
announcement. "We congratulate them. We're very happy that they have taken 
action. Obviously, we are being heard by the American public," said Sokolof, 
who radically altered his diet after surviving a heart attack 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sokolof said he believed that there was an overwhelming consumer protest over 
tropical oils after the Heart Savers ads because many consumers had been taken 
in by the "no cholesterol" promotions and were shocked to learn that the oils 
were high in saturated fats. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Malaysians Upset 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the foods will continue to include high-cholesterol butter and 
eggs, Sokolof said that is different because consumers who want to avoid 
cholesterol are more aware of the properties of those products. 
</P>
<P>
Although the food companies have quieted protest among consumers, they have 
raised the ire of the government of Malaysia, which exported $76 million in 
palm oil to the United States in 1987. "This particular campaign is a form of 
trade protectionism disguised as a health issue," Berkeat Gan, Malaysia Trade 
Commissioner, said Wednesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The American Soybean Assn. has asked the Food and Drug Administration to 
require that tropical oils not be classified as vegetable oils and that food 
products containing the oils be labeled as containing a saturated fat. (Some 
companies have said they are substituting soybean oil for tropical oils.) 
</P>
<P>
Some Malaysians have privately suggested that American soybean producers 
inspired the anti-tropical oil campaign. Sokolof said the charge is unfounded 
in that he provides the sole financial support for Heart Savers. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Malaysian palm oil exports to the United States dropped 26% between 
1986 and 1987, Gan said Malaysia views "with concern the impact of the campaign 
on the palm oil industry in Malaysia as it is vital to the country's 
socioeconomic development and poverty eradication program." Some 400,000 people 
work in the industry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The concern of U.S. consumers of the effects of dietary fats on cholesterol 
levels should be rightly addressed at its domestic sources of dairy and animal 
fats which are consumed in far greater amounts," Gan said, adding, "the 
campaign based on the premises that palm oil is a saturated fat and raises 
cholesterol levels, is without sound scientific foundation." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wayne Bidlack, assistant professor at the University of Southern California 
School of Medicine, said the impact on cholesterol levels of removing tropical 
oils from the diet is going to be "probably zero." 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of saturated fats from tropical oils is probably insignificant," 
Bidlack said. Moreover, he said, studies have shown that dietary changes reduce 
cholesterol a maximum of 10%. The most important factors in heart disease, he 
said, are smoking and hypertension. Other factors include obesity and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHY FOOD COMPANIES USE SATURATED FATS 
</P>
<P>
They're inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
They act as emulsifiers, producing smoother taste and texture. 
</P>
<P>
They're readily available. 
</P>
<P>
They lengthen shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOW TYPES OF FATS COMPARE 
</P>
<P>
Fats fall generally into two categories: unsaturated fats, which are lower in 
cholesterol, and saturated fats, which either contain cholesterol or promote 
its formation in the body. At room temperature, unsaturated fats are liquid 
while saturated fats are solid.

China bought 440,000 metric tons of wheat under an export subsidy offer made 
last week, the U.S. Agriculture Department announced. The department said it 
awarded subsidies averaging $22.64 per ton to export companies selling the 
wheat. The department also said that the Soviet Union bought 250,000 tons of 
non-subsidized corn.

<P>
Arthur L. Liman, GAF's lead attorney, made the disclosure in U.S. District 
Court in Manhattan with jurors absent from the courtroom. Liman mentioned the 
possible violations during a discussion about the admissibility of evidence in 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
One source said the contributions were made primarily to several U.S. senators. 
Lawyers said additional details about the contributions may come out in 
testimony today. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments, lawyers for GAF Corp. and its vice chairman asked U.S. 
District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe to declare a mistrial in the case, claiming 
that the government was too slow in turning over documents needed by the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
The judge didn't issue a ruling, however, and the criminal trial is due to 
resume today with the government's star witness, former Jefferies Group 
Chairman Boyd L. Jefferies, still on the stand. Discussions about the documents 
took place in closed meetings in the judge's chambers but are believed to 
relate to Securities and Exchange Commission documents only recently turned 
over to the defense. Some of them detail discussions between SEC officials and 
Jefferies' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
GAF and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, are accused of hiring Jefferies 
&amp; Co., the main brokerage unit of Jefferies Group, to bid up the price of 
Union Carbide Corp. stock in 1986 at a time when GAF was poised to sell a big 
block of Carbide shares. Boyd Jefferies has pleaded guilty to two felony counts 
and is cooperating with prosecutors while he awaits sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both sides agreed Wednesday to limit their questioning of Jefferies 
about other possible criminal violations of securities laws he may have 
committed.

FACTORY ORDERS ADVANCE 0.3% IN NOVEMBER

<P>
New orders received by American factories, a key indicator of economic 
activity, increased a modest 0.3% in November after a strong 2% jump in 
October, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But economists said the nation's industrial sector was stronger than shown by 
the November orders, which rose despite a sharp drop in orders for military 
hardware, such as tanks and missiles, that fluctuate widely from month to 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Non-defense orders rose a more robust 1.1%, following a 0.6% October gain, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
Total orders in November were a seasonally adjusted $227.73 billion, up 8.7% 
from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Looks Healthy' 
</P>
<P>
The biggest order increase in November was for electrical machinery, 
particularly defense communications equipment, while the largest decline was in 
orders for transportation equipment other than commercial aircraft, the 
department said. 
</P>
<P>
"The industrial sector still looks very healthy," said economist David Wyss of 
Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
American manufacturers, who have been capitalizing on booming export sales and 
business spending on new equipment, also are recapturing domestic sales from 
foreign companies in chemicals, textiles and primary metals, Wyss said. 
</P>
<P>
A vibrant manufacturing sector will lead the economy through its continuing 
expansion, now in its seventh year, but with less vigor than in 1988, 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
In one sign of slowing, the index of leading indicators, the government's main 
barometer of future economic activity, registered a 0.2% decline in November, 
the department reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
While economists expect grh in exports and capital spending to slow in 1989, 
there has been little evidence so far that the industrial sector is slowing, 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not getting any reports from manufacturers that orders slowed 
significantly in either November or December," said Jerry Jasinowski, chief 
economist for the National Assn. of Manufacturers.

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: CLARION OFFERS VERSATILE DATABASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard O'Reilly, RICHARD O'REILLY designs microcomputer applications for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most difficult challenges for any software developer is to create a 
program that is as good for the beginner as it is for the seasoned computer 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
Clarion Software Corp. of Pompano Beach, Fla., has done exactly that, however, 
with a pair of database programs: Clarion Personal Developer, $169, and Clarion 
Professional Developer, $695. 
</P>
<P>
Clarion's products have a dual use, just like the better known programmable 
database packages such as dBase III and IV, Rbase for DOS or Paradox. 
</P>
<P>
The Personal Developer is great for managing your own database lists of 
addresses or inventories or whatnot, or as a tool for designing prototypes of 
more elaborate database applications, including sophisticated relational 
databases. Those can then be polished and enhanced with the Professional 
Developer and turned into commercial applications that can be given or sold to 
others -- all without paying any fees to Clarion. 
</P>
<P>
Database software is used to keep track of lists of information, from a simple 
name and address list to something as complex as a payroll management system or 
a full-fledged accounting system. 
</P>
<P>
When the program is able to work with only a single list at a time, it is known 
as list management software. When it can keep track of information in two or 
more lists simultaneously, it is a relational database. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Programming Code Hidden 
</P>
<P>
For instance, think of the many kinds of lists that could be built using the 
names of company employees as the single common denominator. There could be an 
address and telephone list, a departmental assignment list, a pay scale list, 
an insurance benefits list and a tax withholding rate list. 
</P>
<P>
A relational database program would allow you to print reports or view 
on-screen data displays and entry forms combining elements of information from 
any of those lists. List management software, on the other hand, would restrict 
you to dealing only with data from a single list at a time. 
</P>
<P>
The beauty of Clarion's products is that beginners, using Personal Developer, 
can easily create simple data lists without even knowing that at the same time 
they are writing a real program that will be used to manage that list. 
</P>
<P>
Programming code is hidden from computer beginners. But more experienced users 
-- either a beginner after a few months of working with the software, or a real 
database programmer -- can use the code to create a more elaborate relational 
set of data to accomplish important business tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you are a beginner or experienced, Clarion easily creates very 
attractive applications, with pop-up menus to guide the user, multicolor 
screens, customized help instructions to aid in filling in the blanks and much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
One good use of Personal Developer would be to distribute it among the 
employees of an office who need to work with different kinds of data lists. 
They could use it to create prototypes of the databases they needed. Then, 
these files could be given to a more experienced developer, who could enhance 
them and perhaps tie them together into a master program accessible to each 
user over a PC network. 
</P>
<P>
The Personal Developer has the option of starting out in the "quick start" mode 
in which a data record (a single complete entry in a list of data) could be 
composed with up to 10 individual "fields" of data, such as last name, first 
name, address, city, state and ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
If users tell Clarion Personal Developer that they would like to gain access to 
the list by the last name field or the city field or the state field, the 
program will automatically create three indexes and screen displays. Those 
would allow the user to choose the order in which the information would be 
displayed: alphabetically by last name or by city or by state. 
</P>
<P>
Much more complex database applications can be built with Personal Developer if 
the user takes advantage of the prompt-driven features that allow a simple 
database to be elaborately customized. If that is done, there is little 
practical limit to the number of fields of data that can be contained in the 
list, and multiple lists can be used simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
Nowhere in this process does the user have to learn how to write a single line 
of programming code. All you do is make selections from menus of choices that 
are presented at each step along the development course. But anyone with even a 
smattering of programming experience in some other language will begin to learn 
how the database application is constructed. 
</P>
<P>
Real programmers probably will want to start out right away with Clarion 
Professional Developer, a full-featured database programming language with 
which you can build applications as complicated as they get. 
</P>
<P>
Even with Professional Developer, the neophyte programmer can start out in an 
easy mode called Designer that works like Personal Developer, but without the 
very simple quick-start feature. 
</P>
<P>
You are never very far away from the actual programming code in Professional 
Developer, with access to a text editor with which you can write or revise code 
just a couple of keystrokes away. 
</P>
<P>
When you use the Designer feature, Clarion Professional Developer is writing 
the programming code to execute the design choices you make. The language is 
similar to the popular C programming language (in which both versions of 
Clarion were written), but it is easier to understand and is blissfully free of 
the rigorous punctuation requirements that make languages such as Pascal 
difficult to work with. The Clarion code developed by the Designer mode is 
fully annotated to explain what it does. 
</P>
<P>
Clarion has three language extensions available for Professional Developer, 
priced from $30 to $50 each, that allow you to add communications capabilities, 
specialized financial math calculations and the ability to use and create 
dBase-format files. 
</P>
<P>
In short, if you need to develop your own database applications or, better yet, 
if you are an expert developer or would like to become one, Clarion's programs 
are very attractive tools.

CLARION: THE SPECS 
</P>
<P>
Features 
</P>
<P>
Clarion Software Corp. has published a pair of database programs, Personal 
Developer and Professional Developer. Personal Developer's "quick start" mode 
automates creation of simple database applications. They can be modified and 
expanded into full relational database systems by making choices from a series 
of development menus. Applications can be distributed to others for free or 
modified more extensively with the other program, Professional Developer. 
Professional Developer's Designer mode allows novices to create fully commented 
programming code that can be modified and expanded with built-in editor. 
Experts can bypass Designer and write code directly in the editor. Compiled 
"run-time" and .EXE versions of the program can be distributed for free. 
Language extensions add communications, financial calculations and the ability 
to use and create dBase files. 
</P>
<P>
Requirements 
</P>
<P>
IBM PC/XT, PC/AT, PS/2 or compatible computers with at least 512 kilobytes of 
random access memory (RAM) and hard disk storage. Color monitors are helpful, 
but not required. Applications that users develop can be used on computers 
equipped with floppy disk drives.

STOCKS' GAIN BEST SINCE OCTOBER; DOW UP 33.04

<TEXT>
<P>
A late burst of program trading, coupled with a sharp rise in the dollar, 
combined Wednesday to give Wall Street stocks their biggest one-day advance in 
more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, down 23.93 on Tuesday, climbed 33.04 to 
2,177.68. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 3 to 1 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading, with Big Board volume rising to 149.70 million shares, up 
from 128.50 million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good, broad, impressive rally," one trader said. "I think it's got some 
sustainability to it." 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's rise was the largest since Oct. 20, when it gained 44 points, and 
leaves the index just a few points below its post-crash high of 2,183.50. 
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts attributed the market's strength to a sharp rise in the dollar, 
which added nearly 2 pfennigs against the West German mark on news that U.S. 
Navy jets shot down two Libyan fighters over the Mediterranean Sea. 
</P>
<P>
"We had very strong buy programs kicking in," said Jack Barbanel, senior vice 
president at Gruntal &amp; Co. Traders said futures-linked buying helped the 
Dow double its early gains in the last hour of the session. 
</P>
<P>
An early rise in bond prices also helped the stock market, as did a 28-cent 
drop in the price of U.S. crude oil to $17.08 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign trading, the Tokyo stock market started off the new year with a bang 
on Wednesday, climbing to a record close. The 225-share Nikkei index ended an 
abbreviated half-day session up 84.66 at 30,243.66. 
</P>
<P>
London shares ended near the day's highs, boosted by Wall Street's early 
advance and a stronger dollar. The Financial Times index closed up 10.2 at 
1,793 after a 10.3-point drop Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mixed Wednesday, reacting favorably to a firmer dollar but 
anticipating that Friday's unemployment report might show a big increase in 
jobs, boosting inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 1/16th of a point, or 62.5 cents per $1,000 
face amount, while its yield closed at 9.08%, unchanged from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Goldinger, of the investment banking firm Capital Insight Inc. in Beverly 
Hills, said the bond market was anticipating Friday's release of federal 
jobless figures for December. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.125%, down from 9.625% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
Prices of copper futures rose sharply on the New York Commodity Exchange on 
supply worries rekindled by the apparent bombing of three locomotives in Peru 
and a decline in the exchange's warehouse stocks of copper. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, precious metals futures retreated, grain and soybean futures 
surged, cattle futures rose while pork futures fell and stock index futures 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Copper settled 3.1 to 6.3 cents higher, with the spot contract at $1.58 a pound 
and the more actively traded contract for delivery in March at $1.426 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The bombing of the locomotives in Peru, the world's sixth-largest copper 
producer, served to remind traders that the settlement last month of a 57-day 
Peruvian miners strike did not defuse the country's internal political tensions 
or the potential for disruptions in the copper pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commodity Exchange reported a 301-ton decline in its warehouse 
stocks of copper to 7,964 tons. It was the first daily decline after more than 
a week of steady or rising supplies, indicating that copper consumers have 
returned to the marketplace after a holiday break. 
</P>
<P>
Precious metals prices fell on the Comex in response to the dollar's strength, 
which was in turn a reaction to the U.S. downing of two Libyan fighter planes 
off the Libyan coast, analysts said.

News that U.S. Navy jets shot down two Libyan fighters Wednesday spurred panic 
buying of dollars, sending the U.S. currency up nearly two pfennigs against the 
West German mark. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also aided by expectations of strong U.S. employment data. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of 
$408.50 for an ounce of gold, down from $411 late Tuesday. On the Commodity 
Exchange in New York, an ounce of gold fell to $408.70 from $410.80 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar had begun rising in foreign markets prior to news of the skirmish, 
but traders said bidding for the U.S. currency intensified afterward. The U.S. 
currency is regarded as a safe haven in times of international tension. 
</P>
<P>
"The dollar did snap back quite a bit," said Robert Hatcher, vice president of 
corporate foreign exchange in the New York office of Britain's Barclays Bank 
PLC. 
</P>
<P>
He described the dollar buying as a "flight to quality" prompted by the 
incident in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many traders are said to be expecting Friday's government report 
on unemployment for December to show strong job growth. Such a showing could 
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to rein in growth, a move 
which would boost the dollar, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Before European markets opened, the dollar fell in Tokyo against the Japanese 
yen on the first day of trading there after the New Year's holiday. Dealers in 
Tokyo said there was massive selling of dollars after excessive buying at the 
end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed in Tokyo at 124.05 Japanese yen, down from Friday's 125.90 
yen before the holiday. In London late Wednesday the dollar traded higher at 
124.95 yen. By the end of trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 124.97 
yen, up from 123.82 yen late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar's fall in Tokyo didn't seem to affect dealing in Europe, where the 
U.S. currency rose after the opening on the heels of a large number of 
commercial orders and expectations of higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar also rose against the British pound, which lost its 2-cent gain of 
Tuesday, dropping back to $1.8065 from $1.8270. In late New York trading a 
pound was worth $1.8090, cheaper than $1.8225 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared to Tuesday's late rates, 
included: 1.7875 West German marks, up from 1.7670; 1.5282 Swiss francs, up 
from 1.4907; 6.0910 French francs, up from 6.0340; 1,314.50 Italian lire, up 
from 1,300.50, and 1.1925 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1916.

Oil prices closed lower Wednesday, with the benchmark U.S. crude falling 28 
cents a barrel, in part because of news that OPEC oil output reached a 
seven-year high in December. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate closed at $17.08 a barrel after falling as low as 
$17.01 in earlier trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
A Reuters survey of international oil executives, government officials and 
shipping sources released Wednesday found that OPEC produced 22.76 million 
barrels a day in December, the highest level since May, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries began new production limits 
Jan. 1, and some analysts said that members were probably trying to produce as 
much oil as possible before the new quotas.

$10,000 FOR HEIGHT VARIANCE; 
</P>
<P>
RESTAURATEUR PLEADS GUILTY TO OFFER OF BRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN DAVIDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restaurateur Francis M. Delaney pleaded guilty Wednesday to offering a $10,000 
bribe to a Newport Beach planning commissioner to win city approval for raising 
the height of a planned restaurant to improve the view. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney, 63, of Rancho California in Riverside County, admitted the bribe 
attempt during a preliminary hearing after North County Municipal Court 
Presiding Judge Margaret R. Anderson indicated that, if she were to rule 
immediately, she would convict Delaney and order him to serve 3 years' 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney then pleaded guilty, and Anderson sentenced him to probation and to pay 
fines of about $4,000 and perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
The judge -- who cited Delaney's age, record of volunteer work and donations of 
food for the poor -- could have ordered him to serve 4 years in prison and pay 
$10,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence came 1 day after prosecutors played several taped conversations, 
including one in which Delaney told former Newport Beach Planning Commission 
Chairman James (Buzz) Person that there is "lot's of green lying around if we 
can push it (the height variance) through." 
</P>
<P>
Delaney, owner of the multimillion-dollar Delaney's restaurant chain, needed 
city approval to raise the height of a planned restaurant on West Coast Highway 
to give diners a better view of Lido Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg L. Prickett expressed disappointment with the 
sentence, which he said will make future bribery cases even more difficult to 
prove. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, some custody time, up to one year in jail, would have been 
appropriate for this crime," he said. "The sentence will discourage other 
people who have been offered a bribe from coming forward. 
</P>
<P>
"And second, what message does it send to people who are considering bribing? 
They see as a consequence they will have to pay some money -- as a bribe or as 
a fine." 
</P>
<P>
Delaney could not be reached for comment Wednesday. But defense attorney Byron 
K. McMillan called the sentence "a good deal." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the judge was impressed with the people's witness, Mr. Person," 
McMillan said, adding that his client "just wants to get on with his life." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, however, praised Person, who contacted Newport Beach police 
after Delaney strongly hinted at a bribe during a telephone conversation on 
Jan. 15, 1988. Person agreed to wear a hidden tape recorder to collect 
evidence, and Tuesday he testified in the Fullerton courtroom to the bribe 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"This was solved because Mr. Person was honest and came forward, and because 
Newport Beach police did such a good job with the investigation," Prickett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Person's cooperation with investigators was nearly discovered during a meeting 
at a Newport Beach restaurant on Jan. 21, when Delaney patted Person's clothing 
and found a blank cassette tape but missed the recorder. A short time later, as 
Person excused himself to go to the bathroom to turn the tape recorder over to 
Newport Beach Police Sgt. Al Fischer, Delaney asked him, "Are you going to 
check your tape recorder?" according to transcripts of the tape introduced as 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Close Call 'Unnerving' 
</P>
<P>
"It was unnerving," Person said Wednesday of that close call. He declined to 
comment further on the case or on Delaney's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
In rambling conversations captured on tape, Delaney said an unnamed backer 
would supply $20,000 for bribes, and he proposed that he and Person 
double-cross the backer by splitting the money. Authorities never determined 
whether such a backer existed or whether Delaney lied about the man to distance 
himself from the crime, Prickett said. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney also hinted at potential violence, saying that his "associates" drove 
rather than flew because they couldn't "carry cannons (guns) on planes." 
</P>
<P>
Delaney and Person, who had known each other for 18 years, also exchanged 
family gossip and joked darkly about going to jail, transcripts show. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be your cellmate," Delaney said. "This goes to the grave with 
us." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Delaney's Son Warned Person 
</P>
<P>
Transcripts also revealed that Delaney's son Michael contacted Person as the 
bribe plan took shape. "My father is a desperate, unethical man," Person said 
Michael Delaney told him. "I don't know what he's trying to do by calling you." 
</P>
<P>
Francis Delaney, who had previously hired Person to do legal work for his 
restaurants, wanted Person to persuade a majority of the seven-member Newport 
Beach Planning Commission to let him to raise by 9 feet the level of the 
Lancer's Landing building, where he planned to open a restaurant, according to 
the transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
Without such a height increase for the building, then under construction, the 
view would have been obstructed and customers would "be looking right into the 
bow of a boat," Delaney complained. 
</P>
<P>
The question never came before the commission for a vote. And Delaney now has 
no financial interest in the building at 3100 W. Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney is board chairman of the corporation that bears his name and operates a 
chain of restaurants and catering services in Southern California. In 1986, 
Delaney's Inc. had sales of $15 million and a work force of several hundred, 
according to "Dun's Million Dollar Directory," published by Dun &amp; 
Bradstreet.

POLICE SUSPECT 1 MAN IN 2 BANK ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Orange County banks were robbed 17 minutes apart Wednesday and police 
suspect the same man pulled off both heists. 
</P>
<P>
The first robbery occurred at 11 a.m. at Security Pacific National Bank at 
Culver and Walnut avenues in Irvine. Police said the suspect entered the bank, 
told a teller that he had a handgun and demanded money. He fled on foot with at 
least $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
At 11:17 a.m., a man entered California Federal Savings in the 14200 block of 
Redhill Avenue in Tustin and indicated to a teller that he had a bomb in his 
briefcase, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber then forced two tellers into a vault, returned to their teller 
stations and took an undetermined amount of cash before fleeing on foot, Tustin 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported in either incident, and in both cases other tellers 
were unaware that a robbery was in progress. 
</P>
<P>
Based on statements by witnesses, police said one man is suspected of both 
robberies. The robber in both incidents was described as a light-skinned Latino 
man in his mid-20s, about 5 feet 8 inches tall, with a heavy build. He was 
wearing a full-length tan trench coat, a Panama hat, black trousers and 
prescription glasses.

BOARD VOTES TO BOOST TRASH COLLECTION FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to increase rubbish 
collection fees in unincorporated areas of the county by about 13% for most 
homeowners and 10% for commercial users. 
</P>
<P>
At present, rubbish collection rates range from $6.38 to $7.17 per month for 
residences in unincorporated Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In the communities of Laguna Niguel, El Toro, Dana Point and Lake Forest, the 
fee will increase from $6.90 to $7.80 per month, effective Jan. 1. For 
commercial users in those areas, the fee is increasing from $49.83 to $54.81 
per month. 
</P>
<P>
The range of commercial rates throughout unincorporated Orange County has been 
from $42.49 to $67.68. 
</P>
<P>
R.A. Scott, director of the county's General Services Agency, said the 
increased fees are consistent with those of other cities and counties in 
Southern California. He said the increase is based on a rise in the Consumer 
Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
The last increase in rubbish collection fees was 6% in January, 1988.

CITY MANAGER WARDEN FIRED BY CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing philosophical differences, the City Council fired City Manager Murray L. 
Warden at the Council's regular meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"This was essentially a parting of the ways," said Mayor Charles V. (Chuck) 
Smith, who added that Warden, who was hired 8 months ago, and the council 
"never clicked." The termination was effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced after Warden met with council members in a closed 
session to discuss his job performance, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Warden accepted the position of city administrator, but the job later was 
modified, with the City Council's approval, and he was given the city manager's 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"Murray had his way of doing things, and they didn't always coincide with the 
council's way," Smith said. "We didn't really clash, but we didn't really have 
a meeting of the minds as to how things were going to get done." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Kenny, public works director, was to become interim city manager 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny, who has been employed with the city 15 years, is a former community 
development director and former director of finance. 
</P>
<P>
Warden could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

SAN JUAN'S BAN ON DEVELOPMENT IS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Juan Capistrano City Council has extended for 6 months a moratorium on 
new development until the city's General Plan can be meshed with requirements 
of a slow-growth measure adopted by voters Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Phillip R. Schwartze said the extension will allow the city to 
take care of legal and procedural concerns surrounding slow-growth Measure X. 
</P>
<P>
A planning study to determine the extent of changes to be made should be 
completed in 90 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A 45-day moratorium, originally approved by the council Dec. 6, restricts 
residential, commercial and industrial development in the city, Schwartze said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been challenged by two lawsuits since its passage. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the City Council hired Daniel K. Spradlin, a Santa Ana attorney, to 
defend it in the suits. 
</P>
<P>
The extension was approved on a 4-0 vote. Mayor Pro Tem Lawrence F. Buchheim 
was absent.

DANA POINT REVELS IN CITYHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRANTS TOAST NEW MUNICIPALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CARLTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A postcard ocean view provided a scenic backdrop Wednesday as more than 300 
people crowded into a hilltop resort to celebrate Dana Point's birth this week 
as Orange County's 28th municipality. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural ceremony in a balloon-festooned ballroom at the Dana Point Resort 
became a veritable lovefest as members of the new City Council heaped accolades 
on their fellow citizens and people in the audience listened intently, some 
dabbing at misted eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to the city of Dana Point!" Councilwoman Eileen Krause shouted from a 
ballroom podium, to thunderous applause. "We did it!" 
</P>
<P>
The jubilant residents sang along as a local high school choir belted out 
"America the Beautiful" and other patriotic renditions. After an hourlong 
ceremony, they then attended a reception at which revelers were invited to lift 
their champagne glasses in toast to the new city as a band played songs such as 
"Yankee Doodle Dandy." 
</P>
<P>
The evening's only glitch came in the unexpectedly high turnout. Dana Point 
Resort officials, who hosted the free event, said they had prepared for a crowd 
of 160 people. 
</P>
<P>
But when more than twice that number showed up, many people could not squeeze 
into a small ballroom where the main ceremony was taking place. Many of those 
people crowded into a larger ballroom next door where the reception was held. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the pomp and ceremony, the five-member council conducted a brief meeting 
at which they unanimously selected Councilwoman Judy Curreri to serve as the 
city's first mayor and then named Councilman Bill Bamattre mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of the moment was not lost on the council members, who took 
turns at the podium to invoke the names of America's founding fathers and 
commend Dana Point residents for a cityhood quest that began when John F. 
Kennedy was president. 
</P>
<P>
"We celebrate an accomplishment of the community," Bamattre said. "What we're 
doing today is setting up a permanent institution that will outlive us." 
</P>
<P>
"Cityhood was the dream of many," said Curreri. " . . . Now we have arrived." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Ingrid McGuire's voice broke with emotion as her speech was 
interrupted several times by applause. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very proud," McGuire said. "I pledge that I will serve to the best of 
my ability with honesty and justice." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Mike Eggers, noting that Dana Point's road to cityhood was long and 
difficult, recited this quotation from Thomas Jefferson to describe the city's 
main challenge ahead: 
</P>
<P>
"The will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government, 
and to protect its free expression should be our first object." 
</P>
<P>
Moves toward incorporation began as early as 1961 in Dana Point -- named for 
19th-Century author Richard Henry Dana Jr. -- but did not succeed until this 
year. A milestone came when the county's Local Agency Formation Commission, 
presented with a residents' plan to incorporate just a 3-square-mile area known 
as Old Dana Point, added 1.5-square-mile Capistrano Beach and -- in a move that 
angered adjoining Laguna Niguel -- a 1.5-square-mile coastal strip that 
includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton and the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
These boundaries won voter support in an election on June 7. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council members were officially sworn in Sunday when Dana Point 
effectively became a city, Orange County 5th District Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley administered a ceremonial oath to each Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the city, Stan Cummings, Orange County Marine Institute director 
who served as master of ceremonies, accepted a number of proclamations and 
presentations from state officials, as well as from neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
Among the dignitaries in attendance were the mayors of San Juan Capistrano, San 
Clemente and Mission Viejo, as well as Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), for whom 
Eggers is an aide.

CHURCHES, SALVATION ARMY OPEN DOORS FOR THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County activists for the homeless expressed their thanks Wednesday for 
offers of shelter from local churches and the Salvation Army to replace 
armories in Fullerton and Santa Ana that have been taken over by the National 
Guard for training sessions this week. 
</P>
<P>
"The response has been tremendous," said Scott Mather, head of the Orange 
County Homeless Task Force. "The response is real generous. We've got the food. 
Everything is organized." 
</P>
<P>
The task force coordinates the opening of the emergency shelters when overnight 
temperatures are expected to drop below 40 degrees in dry weather, or to 50 
degrees when a 50% chance of rain is forecast. 
</P>
<P>
A meteorologist at WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times, 
said the extended outlook for the weekend is for more rain and nighttime 
temperatures that could drop into the high 20s. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County armories are among 15 throughout California that will not be 
available as homeless shelters this weekend because of training drills, Guard 
spokesman Maj. Steve Mensik said. 
</P>
<P>
Mather, who chairs the mainly volunteer task force, said the Salvation Army in 
Fullerton, which can house 150 in its building, is already in operation, 
housing the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
A Presbyterian church in Fullerton also is considering offering a facility 
capable of housing 130 people on Friday night and through the weekend, if 
necessary, he added. The National Guard armory in Fullerton can shelter up to 
125 people when it is available. 
</P>
<P>
Two churches in Santa Ana, which Mather declined to name, have promised to open 
their doors and kitchens through the weekend, he said. Another church in 
Mission Viejo also may be available if its board of trustees approves the plan, 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
"We can put 125 (people) into the (Santa Ana churches)," Mather said. "They're 
very comfortable, heated and have nice kitchens." The National Guard armory in 
Santa Ana can also house up to 125 people a night. 
</P>
<P>
The Salvation Army shelter was open Wednesday night and will remain open 
through Sunday night, Mather said. The Santa Ana churches will open their doors 
tonight through Sunday, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Mather's task force will have announcements on the shelter locations and bus 
transportation at the usual pickup points for the homeless, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is the same as we usually do for the armories; they're just 
different end points," he said. 
</P>
<P>
News of the armories closing for National Guard use caught county officials and 
volunteers for the homeless by surprise earlier this week. On Tuesday, they 
issued an urgent appeal for temporary shelter space in the event that cold 
rains or frigid night temperatures made the emergency accommodations necessary.

LAFCO VOTES DOWN LAGUNA BEACH ANNEXATION OF LAGUNA LAUREL AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIANN HANSEN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Laguna Beach city officials, fighting to keep development out of pristine 
Laguna Canyon, were handed a setback Wednesday when the county's Local Agency 
Formation Commission voted against annexation of the planned Laguna Laurel 
development by the city. 
</P>
<P>
However, at its March 1 meeting, the commission will consider placing the 
Irvine Co.-owned development within Laguna Beach's sphere of influence, which 
could allow the Laguna Laurel area to be annexed in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The city had requested that LAFCO approve annexation of about 2,500 acres of 
land in Laguna Canyon, including the 1,600-acre Laguna Laurel project. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission decided on a 5-0 vote to exclude Laguna Laurel from 
Laguna Beach's annexation proposal, it also unanimously decided that at its 
March 1 meeting it will consider annexation of a 900-acre area east of Laguna 
Canyon Road that is already in the city's sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel a very special affinity for that canyon and would like to have a say 
about what happens in that canyon," Laguna Beach Mayor Robert Gentry said after 
the LAFCO meeting, which was attended by about 10 Laguna Beach city officials 
and residents. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry said annexation was sought because city officials believe that the 
Irvine Co.'s plan for a multimillion-dollar housing and commercial project in a 
part of Laguna Canyon does not coincide with the desires of many Laguna Beach 
residents to preserve the wilderness area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we're out taking land," Gentry said of the city's effort. "It's 
the geography of the canyon, it's the name of it and the history of it" that 
belongs to Laguna Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discussion 'Premature' 
</P>
<P>
In opposing Laguna Beach's annexation plan, Irvine Co. official Carol Hoffman 
told the commissioners that "discussion of annexation at this time is 
premature." Hoffman noted that the property is still undeveloped and requires 
no municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
Gentry told LAFCO that the city is the "logical" agency to provide services to 
the area, which will also include a school within the Laguna Beach Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the city's hopes of gaining any control of 
the Laguna Laurel area are in vain without agreement by the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
But Hoffman said after the meeting that she could not say whether the company 
would ever agree to annexation of the property by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to speculate at this point. The city has been unwilling to discuss 
development for any of our properties," Hoffman said, adding that if the 
company does not want the area to be annexed, the county would be able to 
provide such municipal services as police and fire. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors on April 27 approved a development agreement 
for the Laguna Laurel project on a 3-2 vote, one of a series of such developer 
agreements approved in advance of an unsuccessful slow-growth ballot measure 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Laurel project calls for 3,204 housing units, 475,000 square feet of 
commercial space and two golf courses. The agreement requires the Irvine Co. to 
help the county finance $14 million in road improvements and provide 17.4 acres 
of open space. The firm must also conform to other county requirements and 
provide another $36.7 million in road improvement financing and 1,340 acres of 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Laurel area previously was within Laguna Beach's sphere of 
influence. But LAFCO removed it from the city's sphere in 1981 at the request 
of the Irvine Co.

GOLDEN WEST FORFEITS 11 VICTORIES

<P>
The Golden West College women's basketball team has forfeited 11 victories this 
season because it used an ineligible player, assistant Coach Dave Stricklin 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Wilson, a sophomore guard, was not included on the list of eligible players 
submitted to the Orange Empire Conference for the first half of the season but 
played because Golden West Coach Dick Stricklin thought she had been included 
on the list, Dave Stricklin said. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West drops from 18-3 to 7-14 overall. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is eligible for second-semester games, which include Golden West's first 
conference game Wednesday. Golden West defeated Riverside, 111-54, and Wilson 
scored 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really unfortunate," Dave Stricklin said. "But it doesn't affect us in 
conference, and that's what determines if you make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be a big deal to some people, but the team isn't upset about it all. 
We are fine and ready to play now." STEVE KRESAL

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; 
</P>
<P>
ROUGH START HAS HAD ITS SMOOTH MOMENTS 
</P>

<P>
The 1988-89 basketball season is still well short of the halfway mark, but it 
already has been a long, winding and often bumpy road for UC Irvine. Some 
observations after the first 10 games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC Coach George Raveling says coaches who over-schedule "end up working at 
K mart." Bill Mulligan doesn't figure to be alerting shoppers to blue-light 
specials any time soon, but the veteran UC Irvine coach is beginning to think 
Raveling may have a point. 
</P>
<P>
After watching the Anteaters stagger to a 3-6 nonconference record (0-1 in the 
Big West), Mulligan has yearned for a few Azusa Pacifics and USIUs to mix in 
with the Virginias, Pepperdines and San Diego States. 
</P>
<P>
There is one drawback, however. Had he been adhering to Raveling's philosophy 
when last week's UCLA game was scheduled, Irvine would be without one of its 
biggest victories ever. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the 91-90 victory over the Bruins was nice, too. The Anteaters 
received a much-needed confidence boost before embarking on a Big West schedule 
that includes six of the next eight games in the other guy's gym. 
</P>
<P>
"You see UCLA and then we win that game and you start to think, 'Hey, we're 
pretty good,' " Mulligan said. "But then you watch some tapes of Santa Barbara, 
see a good, veteran New Mexico State team win by just 5 at Fullerton and read 
the Fresno State score (the Bulldogs won, 76-72, at Utah State) and you start 
to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
"I never do goals. I mean, we'd like to win more games than we won in the 
nonconference season, but I don't think you can ever tell a team that they've 
got to win a certain game." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Another look at the tape of the upset of UCLA makes the outcome easier to 
understand. The Bruins were generally uninspired after jumping out to a 12-3 
lead in just 2 1/2 minutes. And three Anteaters played as well they can while 
three others performed admirably. 
</P>
<P>
Forwards Mike Doktorczyk and Jeff Herdman were a combined 13 of 17 from the 
field and 6 of 6 from 3-point range. They also combined to haul in 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Herdman was clearly in front of the line on one 3-pointer and Doktorczyk was 
more than a yard behind it on one of his bombs, but both played inspired 
basketball and shot incredibly well. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Labat, Ricky Butler and Rod Palmer (a combined 13 of 32 from the field), 
didn't shoot as accurately as Herdman and Doktorczyk, but they chipped in with 
a total of 32 points and 10 rebounds and played key defensive roles. 
</P>
<P>
The play of Kevin Floyd, Irvine's senior guard, was the biggest factor, though. 
He bordered on being out of control all evening, but somehow only good things 
happened when he appeared to be racing headlong into trouble. When he 
recklessly charged toward the hoop -- which was often -- he either managed to 
draw a foul or somehow slip the ball into the basket. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd played 37 minutes, handled the ball most of the night and committed just 
3 turnovers. That is probably his most impressive statistic on a night when he 
was 10 of 16 from the floor and 6 of 7 from the free throw line with 8 assists 
and 3 steals. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Floyd finally has turned the corner," Mulligan said. "He's becoming 
more of a leader. He scored 29 at (Las) Vegas, 20 before fouling out at 
Virginia and 26 against UCLA. Besides that, he's playing point guard without 
turning the ball over. 
</P>
<P>
"He looks out of control sometimes, but we're almost to the point where you let 
him go a little. He has so much ability. Of course, if he goes completely 
goofy, I'll still nail him." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Good fortune is always a factor in close games, and Irvine had its share 
against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
With 3:06 remaining, UCLA forward Don MacLean tipped the ball into the Irvine 
basket while trying to gain control of a rebound. That gave Irvine an 84-79 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the foul on Darrick Martin that UCLA Coach Jim Harrick called "a 
joke." Mike Labat was driving through the lane when he slipped and fell. 
Harrick wanted a traveling call, but television replays clearly showed Martin's 
hand on Labat's hip. 
</P>
<P>
Was Labat pushed or would he have slipped, anyway? Who knows, but the call was 
no joke. Labat made both free throws and Irvine led, 89-87, with 12 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Even Floyd might admit a few of his flying layups were lucky shots. Maybe. But 
his coast-to-coast looping layup at the buzzer was athleticism as art. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mulligan has changed the Anteaters' style of play more often than some guys 
change their socks, but he insists his unwillingness to give up the full-court 
press for good is at the root of Irvine's woes. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's the bottom line," he said. "I screwed up by playing the style I wanted 
to play and even more by being too stubborn to realize we couldn't play that 
way and win. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got behind, 23-9, to Virginia, I finally said we're going to go to a 
style where we at least have a chance to win. It's the reason we're so far 
behind. We've spent too much time working on the wrong things. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my responsibility that our record isn't better. I know it falls on me. 
And I'll never again make that mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Then again, maybe Irvine's poor start can be attributed to a lack of bad 
chemistry. "Everyone's working so hard together," Mulligan said. "Hell, 
nobody's even disgruntled." 
</P>
<P>
Anteater Notes

The men's swimming team, which finished 10th overall and sixth among college 
teams at the U.S. Open Swimming Championships last month, will be back in 
action Saturday and Sunday when it plays host to the UCI Invitational at 
Heritage Park. Sixteen men's teams and 14 women's teams are expected to 
compete. Third-ranked USC, led by Olympian Dave Wharton, will be the favorite 
in the men's competition. . . . Two Irvine water polo players were named 
All-Americans this week. Junior Tom Warde, who scored 108 goals this season, 
was a first-team selection, and Tony Bell, a senior who scored 65, was a 
third-team pick. 
</P>
<P>
Four men's tennis players -- Mike Briggs, Richard Lubner, Shige Kanroji and 
Mike Cadigan -- will compete this weekend in the National Collegiate Tennis 
Classic at Shadow Mountain Resort and Tennis Club in Palm Desert. Briggs, who 
is not a nationally ranked singles player, recently returned from the Citrus 
Bowl Tournament in Orlando, where he won the singles consolation championship, 
defeating 14th-ranked Mario Rincon of Kentucky and 25th-ranked Steve Longley of 
South Carolina in the process. . . . Wayne Engelstad, the former Irvine 
standout who was cut by the Denver Nuggets last month, is reportedly heading 
for the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
How They Stack Up: USA Today's basketball rankings, which take into account the 
strength of schedule, list UCLA 22nd, Pepperdine 46th, Virginia 84th, Georgia 
State 105th, San Diego State 115th, Loyola of Chicago 131st and University of 
San Francisco 169th. Irvine is No. 175.

Nicaragua devalued its currency by 54%, the seventh drastic adjustment in a 
year, and cut subsidies on transportation to combat an economic slump and 
soaring inflation. The official exchange rate of the cordoba against the dollar 
has been set at 2,000 to 1. The government cut the subsidies as part of a plan 
to avoid printing money to cover a widening budget deficit. President Daniel 
Ortega has announced major budget cuts for 1989, including a 29% cut in 
military spending. Prices rose 21.742% in 1988, according to Ortega.

Security Pacific Hoare Govett Holdings Ltd. said Wednesday it is joining the 
growing list of major financial companies reducing operations in London's 
securities markets. 
</P>
<P>
The broker, a unit of Los Angles-based banking giant Security Pacific Corp., 
said it is withdrawing from the dealing of gilts, Eurobonds and Japanese 
equities. The withdrawal from those businesses will eliminate 140 of the 
broker's 1,200 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"The economics of these businesses have become unattractive and are likely to 
remain so for the next three to five years," Hoare Govett's chief executive 
Peter Voss said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The cutback also reflects efforts at the parent company in Los Angeles to 
curtail costs. Industry analyst Dan B. Williams, with the San Francisco 
brokerage Sutro &amp; Co., said: "The management at Security Pacific is taking 
a hard look at all its operations. If it doesn't look like it's going to make 
money, they are going to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
The decision on Hoare Govett follows withdrawals last year by several other 
major gilts market makers including Citicorp and Morgan Grenfell Group. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific said its other equities and banking operations would be 
unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
Further pullouts from the highly competitive gilts and Eurobond markets have

Hoare Govett is the seventh primary dealer to cease trading in gilts since the 
London markets were deregulated in the 1986 Big Bang. Many brokers overstaffed 
in anticipation of faster growth in the London market, whose trading volume is 
down sharply since the October 1987 crash. There are now 22 gilts market makers 
in a market which some analysts say can support only half that number.

About half Security Pacific's 140 job losses are in the debt trading area. They 
include 20 gilts traders, 18 Eurobond traders and 16 futures dealers, Voss 
said. He added that the bank would continue to raise money for its clients in 
the capital markets through medium-term notes, private placements and 
syndicated loans, Voss said.

CUSHMAN'S STOCK TAKEN OFF NASDAQ SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cushman Electronics, a Newport Beach manufacturer of cellular communications 
equipment, said its stock has been removed from the computerized 
over-the-counter stock exchange because it failed to meet financial 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the delisting from the National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotation (NASDAQ) system, Cushman will probably halt the 
registration of its common stock to cut expenses, Vice Chairman Mark K. Howlett 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Federal securities regulations permit companies with fewer than 500 
stockholders and assets not exceeding $5 million during the last 3 years to 
withdraw their stock from public trading. Cushman meets both guidelines, 
Howlett said. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman could achieve significant savings on legal and accounting costs by no 
longer filing the quarterly and annual financial reports required of public 
companies, Howlett said. 
</P>
<P>
"When companies are downsizing, it's an awful burden to have all these costs," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Effective Wednesday, Cushman became a "pink sheet" stock -- traded only by 
securities firms willing to find buyers and sellers for the shares. Daily price 
quotations will no longer be provided on the NASDAQ system. 
</P>
<P>
According to Howlett, Cushman stock traded Wednesday within a range of 62.5 
cents and $1 per share. 
</P>
<P>
Cushman reported earnings of $378,000 for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. It 
had a loss of $2 million the previous year. Sales fell 31%, to $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1987, Cushman announced a restructuring that included closing a San 
Jose production facility and discontinuing several unprofitable product lines, 
including monitors and maintenance instruments for two-way radios. 
</P>
<P>
As of Sept. 30, Cushman's shareholders equity was $256,000, which did not meet 
the NASDAQ minimum requirement of $375,000.

MAGGIE'S SON; 
</P>
<P>
WHY DID HE SUCCEED AND SOME DIDN'T? HE FOUND THE ANSWER IN HER DREAM 
</P>

<P>
Dr. James Comer clearly remembers the house call he made one night in East 
Chicago, Ind., when he was a young intern moonlighting for another doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the apartment door, he was instantly repelled by the sight of thousands 
of cockroaches crawling on the walls and on two children asleep in orange 
crates on the floor. A greater shock came, however, when Comer recognized the 
children's mother, who was the patient, as a girl he had gone to high school 
with -- someone he remembered as having been like him, smart and with 
"potential." Now she was suffering from severe depression stemming, he 
surmised, from the abject poverty she lived in. And, Comer recalled sadly, 
there was no remedy for that in his doctor's bag. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Powerful Turning Point 
</P>
<P>
"That was a powerful turning point," Comer said during a recent visit to Los 
Angeles from his home in New Haven, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Why did their lives turn out so differently? 
</P>
<P>
Now the associate dean of the Yale School of Medicine and a professor of 
psychiatry at the Yale Child Study Center, he provides a touchingly personal 
answer to that question in "Maggie's American Dream: The Life and Times of a 
Black Family," published in November by New American Library. 
</P>
<P>
The book tells a black success story, the first half of which focuses on his 
remarkable mother, Maggie Comer, who was born poor in the rural South in 1904. 
As the story unfolds in her own words, she tells of how she never finished 
grade school, suffered under a cruel stepfather and worked a series of menial 
jobs most of her life -- from domestic to operating the elevator in the 
hospital where James was an intern. 
</P>
<P>
Toiling against the odds, she reared five children who would later earn 13 
college degrees among them and go on to successful careers. One son is an 
optometrist, another son is superintendent of public schools and her two 
daughters are teachers. 
</P>
<P>
The second part of the slim volume presents James Comer's story about his own 
quest for meaningful work. The second eldest of the five Comer children, he is, 
aside from his posts at Yale, a regular columnist for Parents magazine, author 
of several books on racism and education and a noted expert on the education of 
inner-city youths. 
</P>
<P>
Central to both sections of Comer's frequently painful memoir is the idea that 
a child's earliest experiences at home and at school can shape aspirations and 
accomplishments later in life. It is a notion that was embraced strongly by 
Comer's mother and would deeply influence the successful work Comer, as a 
psychiatrist, would do later with underachieving minority students in New Haven 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
As he relaxed on a recent morning in the living room of the Van Nuys house 
shared by his son, Brian, and his daughter, Dawn, Comer reflected on his 
mother's incalculable influence on his life and the sense of urgency he felt in 
sharing the details of her life with others. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many black success stories that aren't being told," the 54-year-old 
psychiatrist said. "All you hear about is the gangs, the families that have 
been overwhelmed. I feel it is very important to understand what successful 
black families did and how they function, even just to know that they exist. 
Because the stereotypes give you the notion that they don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
In a neat, dark business suit sans tie, Comer sought to explain why he took a 
tape recorder to his mother 10 years ago and asked her just to start talking -- 
about her upbringing, marriage, jobs, values, "how she figured out all of those 
things," he said, that enabled her to beat the odds society had stacked against 
her. 
</P>
<P>
According to James Comer, his mother "in some ways defies description" -- even 
by someone like himself whose professional focus is observing and understanding 
the twists and turns of human character. On this morning, his mental image of 
Maggie Comer brought a grin and a gentle chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Active at 84 
</P>
<P>
"She is always rushing somewhere," he said, leaning into the sofa in the 
sparely furnished living room. At 84, he said, she is still going strong, 
active in church, clubs and school affairs in East Chicago, where she lives in 
an apartment owned by one of her sons. 
</P>
<P>
She balked initially at baring the intimate details of her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I just lived and tried to help others and thought nothing of it," the 
octogenarian confirmed recently in a telephone interview from East Chicago. "I 
didn't let my children know how hard it was to raise them. Not being an 
educated person, I had to make it the hard way. But I loved it, I love my 
children, I love my life." And gradually, she allowed her son to convince her 
that sharing her story might help others making the same struggle. 
</P>
<P>
James Comer recalls that the seed for the book was planted during a visit to a 
family cemetery in Comer, Ala., a town named after the owners of Comer's slave 
ancestors. It was about 1977, and the "Roots" phenomenon was going full force. 
Looking at the graves of several generations of his father's family, he thought 
to himself glumly, "Here lies the history of my family -- gone forever." 
</P>
<P>
Some months later, his mother joined his family for a vacation in Barbados. 
Remembering the feelings stirred during the graveside visit, Comer had brought 
along a portable tape recorder, intending to create an oral history of his 
mother's life that would be for family consumption only. Interviews were 
conducted sporadically over the next six years, but it took Comer a long time 
to see that the story "went beyond my mom" to broader themes he had been been 
struggling with for almost 20 years in his academic work. 
</P>
<P>
Comer's first book, "Beyond Black and White," analyzed the personal and social 
consequences of bigotry in America. It had been published in 1972. Then in 
1975, he co-authored, with Alvin Poussaint, a child-rearing guide for black 
parents. In 1980, he wrote "School Power," which described his efforts to bring 
about a drastic change in New Haven's low-achieving inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Book Emerged 
</P>
<P>
It was only after showing the transcript of his mother's rambling narrative to 
several colleagues that he began to see the outlines of another book, one that 
he thought could describe the black experience more effectively than his 
previous writings had. 
</P>
<P>
"I always felt there were things that were difficult to describe because other 
people didn't have the same experience," he said. "At the same time, I knew 
there were larger factors that play in with the personal experience. My family 
experience turned out to be a better way to describe the black experience than 
I had been able to do." 
</P>
<P>
His mother was born Maggie Nichols in Woodland, Miss., the child of 
sharecroppers. She remembers little about her father because he was killed by 
lightning when she was 5. But Jim Nichols was always calling her "Doll," she 
recalls in the book, and she remembers being his favorite among the five 
children. It was this brief but solid relationship that, James Comer believes, 
gave his mother the inner fortitude to rise above the many hardships she would 
face later at the hands of an uncaring stepfather who often deserted the family 
for long periods, beat her mother, mistreated the children and kept them on the 
move, from Mississippi to Arkansas and finally Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
She met her husband, Hugh Comer, in 1920 when she ran away from home to live 
with a half-sister in East Chicago. Comer, who was the deacon in the town's 
black church, was stern and serious but "as near perfect a man as there can 
be," Maggie Comer says in the book. He didn't smoke, drink or go carousing, and 
he was the type who, "if he told you he was going to do something, you could 
bank on it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Together, they built a solid home environment and worked hard to get ahead. 
They saved enough to buy a small parcel of land, built and rented out two 
duplexes and opened a grocery store. Two or three days a week, Maggie cleaned 
the houses of white families. 
</P>
<P>
But, as she recounts in the book, "I didn't just cook and clean. I worked with 
my eyes and ears open," learning all manner of practical tips. Those ranged 
from how to shop for a good deal and the wisdom of paying a little more to buy 
higher quality goods to what kinds of soaps and oils were best for bathing 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched and listened to them (her employers) and the way they lived," she 
said. "For me it was like going to school." 
</P>
<P>
As James Comer relates in "Maggie's American Dream," she read to her children 
when they were young -- the Comers received not one, but three Sunday 
newspapers when they were growing up -- and made sure she got to know their 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Comer says now he is certain that is why he and his siblings seemed to get more 
help and encouragement in class than did other black youngsters whose parents 
never came to school. Every good grade or other school achievement was treated 
as a victory for the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Buddies Never Made It 
</P>
<P>
As Comer grew older and went on to college, he would run into or hear about 
former schoolmates who never made it. One died from alcoholism, another has 
been in and out of mental institutions, while a third former chum has spent 
much of his life in prisons. There was always a sense of "There but for the 
grace of God go I," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Comer realized that "the difference between me and my buddies was 
that my parents were involved," especially his mother, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother, with father standing behind her so supportive, could go into the 
schools and interact with school people so that when there was a problem, it 
got fixed. People in school knew they had to pay attention to make a difference 
for us, or they would hear from my mother." 
</P>
<P>
It was all of those things, he said, that in 1968 led Comer the psychiatrist to 
help start an innovative program the ripples from which are still spreading. It 
was an intervention project at two poor, black elementary schools that, among 
the 33 schools in New Haven, ranked at the bottom of the achievement scale. 
</P>
<P>
He and Dr. Albert Solnit, then director of the Yale Child Study Center, viewed 
poor school performance not as stemming solely from weak curriculum, lax 
student discipline or inadequate teachers and parents but as "something 
organically wrong with the whole school," said Muriel Hamilton-Lee, associate 
research director of the Yale school development program. "It was controversial 
because it was so comprehensive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aimed at Social Network 
</P>
<P>
So Comer and Solnit designed the program to draw parents into the schools as 
volunteers, and to provide plenty of support for the teaching staff, largely 
through a team of mental health professionals. The idea, Hamilton-Lee said, was 
to improve the social relationships within a school that help students want to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
By 1975, the schools were performing as well as or better than the top schools 
in the city on standardized achievement tests, Comer said, and today, the 
schools continue to make progress. The New Haven approach has been put into 
practice in 50 schools around the country, primarily in the East and the South. 
</P>
<P>
Listening to his mother's story made him realize, he said, "how much your 
parents and your family can play a supportive role and even a destructive role 
. . . and how that family and social network you are a part of really shapes 
your life and your future and the things you believe in. My work is really just 
an extension of what she (Maggie Comer) believed in and what she was interested 
in."

POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: 1989 THE YEAR AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
LETTING LOOSE WITH A LOT OF WISHFUL THINKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Boehm 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I used to work for a newspaper that ran a weekly column of football 
point-spread predictions under the heading, "Watch, but Don't Bet." 
</P>
<P>
The rationale for that curious title seemed to be that, while prognostication 
is too delicious to forgo, the sporting seers weren't about to be held 
responsible if anyone took them seriously and lost the milk money. 
</P>
<P>
In that spirit, here are some predictions for the coming year in pop. You can 
call this column of guesses, fantasies and wishful thinking "Read, but Don't 
Believe": 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the Redcoats will be coming again -- but it will be nothing for rock 
fans to shout about, let alone Paul Revere. This year marks the 25th 
anniversary of the British rock invasion of 1964. Veterans of that 
revolutionary assault will stage comebacks to exploit the occasion, with mostly 
dubious results. 
</P>
<P>
The Who has already announced plans for a reunion album. It will turn out to be 
a humdrum affair, further tarnishing a once-imposing legacy that diminished 
considerably with the albums after Keith Moon's death in 1978. This is one band 
that should have let its career die before it got old. 
</P>
<P>
The lure of megabucks will help the Rolling Stones reconcile their differences 
and tour again. But megabucks will also dictate a shoddy, exploitative tour of 
outdoor stadiums rather than indoor shows that might have generated some real 
heat. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards will produce another lukewarm Stones 
album, no better and no worse than anything they have done since "Some Girls." 
</P>
<P>
Paul McCartney and George Harrison won't reunite, but they will have something 
in common: Each will release a mediocre solo album and mount a mediocre tour. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison will have better luck, however, as a Traveling Wilbury. The group will 
release another strong album, with Don and Phil Everly taking over for the late 
Roy Orbison. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the less famous '60s British invaders will pull off some of the more 
rewarding reunions. The Zombies will come up with a charming album, and so will 
the Hollies. The Kinks will announce early in the year that they have 
disbanded, ending their run as the longest-lived of all rock bands (at least as 
a continuously functioning unit). But the Kinks, who have cried wolf before 
about calling it quits, will come back strong before year's end with the first 
reunion of their original lineup since 1969. The Bee Gees will shuck the disco 
jive and make an appealing album harking back to their days as a folk-rock 
harmony band. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, 1989 will be the year that harmony and pop bel canto make a strong 
comeback. Noting how well Bobby McFerrin did in '88, many acts in R&amp;B will 
rediscover the traditions of the great Motown vocal groups -- the Supremes, the 
Temptations and the Miracles. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of yelling along to a beat box, young ghetto musicians will gather once 
more to sing a cappella on street corners. The result will be a welcome 
transformation for rap music, which in 1989 will begin to mature with a melding 
of tough rhythms and spoken raps interspersed with adventurous, melodic singing 
in a sort of recitative/aria structure. The creative and commercial 
possibilities of this combination will be limitless, propelling black music 
into the '90s on a decided upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Chapman will use her new acclaim in the finest, most adventuresome way, 
by mounting a joint tour, and perhaps recording an album, with Sweet Honey in 
the Rock -- the outstanding, all-female, socially trenchant a cappella 
folk-singing group from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
One of the year's biggest music-related controversies will erupt when a major 
pop figure releases an anthem lauding the PLO and demanding Palestinian 
national rights. The outcome will determine whether rockers stick to such easy, 
uncontroversial issues as human rights (who is publicly for torture and 
repression?) and apartheid (who, outside of South Africa, believes in it?). 
</P>
<P>
Independent record labels will continue to die. Ownership of record companies 
will become so concentrated that an organized movement of musicians, critics 
and fans will arise to lobby federal authorities to move to break up the 
entertainment cartels. Bruce Springsteen will be the first major rocker to 
declare that small is beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County will finally get the full-time, night-in, night-out original rock 
music club it needs. This will happen when Sam Lanni, former proprietor of 
Safari Sam's, hits the lottery and becomes filthy rich overnight. Plowing his 
winnings into a club, Lanni will found a new Safari Sam's that serves both as a 
showcase stage and a social meeting ground for the local music scene. 
</P>
<P>
The new Sam's will also bring to Orange County innovative, lesser-known touring 
talent that previously only played Los Angeles. Anti-rock municipal authorities 
will try to undermine the new Sam's, much as they succeeded in doing with the 
original one. This time, able to afford a team of experts in First Amendment 
law, Lanni will take the stuffed shirts to court and win in a rout. 
</P>
<P>
Before we get on with the new year, let's have the '88 nominees for the Pop 
Hall of Shame: 
</P>
<P>
Ziggy Marley, purported heir to his father's reggae ministry as poet of the 
downtrodden, appears in a Rolling Stone magazine fashion spread wearing clothes 
priced at several times the per-capita wealth of many Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
Lou Reed, whose name had been synonymous with uncompromising, hard-edged rock, 
takes an unfortunate walk on the mild side. Performing in the Grammy Awards 
program, Reed kowtows to the demands of national prime time television by 
expurgating sexually explicit verses from "Walk on the Wild Side." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Winwood jumped on the gravy train by writing a song for a beer 
commercial, then included it on his hit album, "Roll With It," which was a dull 
rehash of his previous hit album. John Barleycorn must die, Steve-o. 
</P>
<P>
Pink Floyd ripped off its public by taking what had been a fine indoor arena 
show with crisp sound and vivid lighting effects and moving it, unchanged, into 
outdoor stadiums where the sound and effects were swallowed up. 
</P>
</TEXT>
<GRAPHIC>
<P>
Photo, Perhaps 1989 will bring a welcome transformation for rap music groups, 
like Run D.M.C., below. And maybe Orange County will finally get a full-time 
original rock music club -- if Sam Lanni, right, formerly of Safari Sam's, wins 
the lottery. Los Angeles Times

NYCO TELLS CASTING FOR CENTER RUN

New York City Opera has announced casting for productions of Verdi's 
"Rigoletto," Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" and Lehar's "The Merry Widow," to be 
staged in January at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>

LIFE ON AN OIL RIG; 
</P>
<P>
MANNING THE OIL PLATFORMS 17 MILES OUT TO SEA -- IT'S A JOB DEMANDING SPECIAL 
SKILLS, PERSONALITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every Thursday at noon, Ed Huben finishes his 5-hour commute from his home near 
San Luis Obispo by swinging to work on the end of a rope. 
</P>
<P>
That maneuver begins a weeklong shift, all of which Huben spends atop a Gordian 
knot of pipes, machinery and electronics that could, if allowed to get out of 
control, blow Huben and his co-workers into tiny pieces. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't, though, because Huben and his co-workers make sure it doesn't. They 
are responsible for overseeing, in alternating 7-day shifts, the operation of 
the largest oil-producing complex off Orange County's coast: tandem offshore 
platforms, known as Ellen and Elly, that are operated by Shell Western 
Exploration &amp; Production Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Round the clock, 365 days a year, hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil 
flow up to the platforms, up from the huge natural reservoir beneath county 
coastal waters that is called the Beta Field by oil workers. 
</P>
<P>
Getting at that oil requires that the workers live and work in an environment 
that demands specialized skill, vigilance, a serene nature and the ability to 
exist 24 hours a day on a structure, alternately dizzying and claustrophobic, 
that often looks and feels like a joint creation of Captain Nemo and Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
It also requires the ability to imitate Tarzan at least twice a week. Because 
the crews arrive at Ellen by boat -- after a 45-minute trip from Long Beach -- 
they use one of several knotted ropes that dangle above one of the lower 
platform catwalks to make the short swing from the boat deck to the catwalk. It 
is, the workers said, the quickest and easiest way to travel the last leg of 
their journey. 
</P>
<P>
Once on the platform, the workers fan out to varied jobs that compel them to 
work, eat, sleep and play in an islandlike isolation a tantalizing 17 miles off 
the county's coast, within sight of the Newport Center high-rises. They are 
surrounded by deep ocean in federal waters, yet they are on a static structure 
supported by several submarine legs that plunge 265 feet to the bottom of the 
ocean, making the platforms immobile islands. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the 40,000-square-foot, 13,400-ton Ellen and the 
55,000-square-foot, 10,600-ton Elly (all platforms in the Beta Field have names 
beginning with the letter E) are actually highly sophisticated buildings. A 
trip around them on foot, however, feels more like a stroll on an oil tanker or 
a submarine. 
</P>
<P>
"Every little space out here is used to its absolute potential," Huben said. 
"Everything is so eminently practical that this place has a kind of beauty of 
its own. And you're finding out new things all the time, things on the platform 
that you haven't noticed before. I've been out here for 6 1/2 years, and there 
was still stuff I was discovering out here after 5 years." 
</P>
<P>
Huben presides over the electronic nerve center of the complex, a room on Elly 
whose walls are covered with switches, gauges and other devices that monitor 
each stage of the path the oil takes -- from the time it enters the platform 
through a series of drilling connectors, to the time it leaves for Long Beach 
through a 16-inch pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Huben makes sure that almost 1,200 separate safety devices are monitored 
constantly and inspected each month. Because of such instrumentation, which 
automatically controls much of the platforms' operation, the entire complex can 
be run by a 20-man crew and three supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Job descriptions, therefore, tend toward the technical rather than the 
physical. The workers like it that way. 
</P>
<P>
"You're more of a technician out here than a roustabout," said Brian 
Kachelhoffer, 28, whose specialty is instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not like the old days, where you found guys working in the oil fields 
whose voice DB (decibel level) was higher than their IQ," said Jack Hannemann, 
45, an electrician. 
</P>
<P>
"We're new oil versus old oil," said Jim Vandivort, 39, also an electrician. 
</P>
<P>
Not to say that they don't occasionally work up a sweat. On Ellen, where the 
oil is collected (drilling has ended at the Shell complex), it is 90 feet from 
the catwalk just above the sea to the building atop the structure that contains 
offices, galley and living quarters. The only way to get from one level to 
another is to climb or descend a series of stairs. There is no elevator. 
Arrangements are similar on Elly, which is reached via a 200-foot catwalk from 
Ellen. 
</P>
<P>
The workers said agility isn't necessarily a prerequisite to a job on the 
platforms -- although a quick tour of the facilities will convince any visitor 
that it is no place for someone with acrophobia. Many of the stairs wind up the 
outside of the structures in such a way that the platform is on one side of the 
stair while a lot of air -- and a long drop to the sea -- is on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Still, said Don Knuppel, the production foreman for Shell's platforms, "these 
guys are the cream of the crop -- we don't send just anybody out here." 
</P>
<P>
The workers, Huben said, tend to behave on the job and off it with a mixture of 
gregariousness and independence. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though there are several of us out here," he said, "I think one of the 
things that counts very heavily is that everyone is capable of performing 
certain duties alone, sometimes under adverse weather conditions, since the 
vast majority of our equipment is outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"And you definitely have to have a sense of humor, because (that provides) one 
of the few (releases from the routine) you have." 
</P>
<P>
Huben said he has been forced to take shelter when 80-m.p.h. winds have lashed 
the platforms and has had to unload boats in high seas. But still the oil kept 
flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say that everything always works like a Swiss watch," he said. 
"Things break from time to time. But they don't disintegrate on you." 
</P>
<P>
Often, adverse conditions are difficult for the crews' families to bear, he 
said. "Guys have left over the years whose families couldn't take the strain. 
Those of us who are married have a tremendous amount of confidence in our 
spouses, though. They really have to do everything at home while we're gone." 
</P>
<P>
The average job tenure on Shell's Beta Field platforms, Knuppel said, is about 
7 years -- which, he added, reflects a fair measure of job satisfaction, 
because the facilities have been operating only since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The pay ranges from $22,500 for beginning unskilled workers to $33,800 for 
experienced workers who have acquired several skills on the job, Huben said. 
</P>
<P>
Crews said they like the work, mainly because it allows them to be with their 
families for a week at a time. "I can actually see my kids growing up," 
Kachelhoffer said. "I can be their playmate. And I can also see how hard it is 
to care for kids." 
</P>
<P>
For Hannemann, his week off tends to divide itself into thirds: "I kind of kick 
back for the first 2 days. Then for the next 2 days I catch up on things with 
my family or on work around the house. The last days I take care of any other 
business that needs to be taken care of, and then I come back here." 
</P>
<P>
When he does, he faces seven consecutive 12-hour shifts, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
(or the reverse if he is one of the four crew members working the night shift). 
And he faces living quarters that are, for the most part, smaller and sparser 
than even the most Spartan college dorm rooms, on Ellen's upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
However, crew members said they also make frequent use of the weight room on 
Elly and the recreation room on Ellen, which includes pool and table-tennis 
tables, a TV room with a VCR and a dart board. Hannemann said he jogs around 
the complex for half an hour or more three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Cabin fever, the workers said, is non-existent. The nearby Orange County shore 
is no more compelling for them, Hannemann said, "than if you were sitting in an 
office anywhere and wishing you were off work." 
</P>
<P>
The daily events around which life on the complex seems to revolve are meals. 
"We've had a couple of bad cooks over the years," Huben said, "but they haven't 
lasted long. The cook has to please everybody all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he said, Don Lewis, the crew's current cook, has done that. While 
Louisiana cooking is Lewis' specialty, Hannemann answered instantly when asked 
about the crew's favorite food. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexican," he said. "Anything Mexican. It's so good that my wife gets mad at me 
when I ask her, 'Why can't you fix it like that?' " 
</P>
<P>
Even with all the attempts to create a homey atmosphere, the workers know -- if 
sometimes only subliminally -- that they are sitting atop a potentially highly 
dangerous piece of complex apparatus that processes about 16,000 barrels of oil 
each day and is powered by huge turbines that produce enough electricity to 
light a small city. 
</P>
<P>
Huben compared the workers' attitudes toward the dangers to his former job: New 
York City police officer. "It's like being a policeman, in that there's always 
that element in the back of your mind that tells you that you may not make it 
home at the end of your shift," he said. "It inbreeds a little extra caution on 
your part. 
</P>
<P>
"But here, you're in control of everything in your environment. You're facing a 
known enemy." 
</P>
<P>
And, Kachelhoffer said, if a major malfunction occurs in any apparatus, there 
are red knobs placed strategically around the complex that, when pulled, can 
shut down the entire operation in less than 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Such stringent safety measures have not satisfied longtime opponents of oil 
drilling off the county coast, however. Environmentalists, politicians, local 
residents and others have said for more than a decade that offshore drilling 
contributes to air pollution, upsets the ocean's ecosystem and constitutes a 
visual blight. They have argued for a ban on further exploration and drilling. 
</P>
<P>
Such platforms as Ellen and Elly, however, are among the newer platforms off 
the California coast, "and the record that those platforms have achieved is 
pretty impressive," said Bob Getts, the public affairs officer for the Los 
Angeles-based Western Oil &amp; Gas Assn. 
</P>
<P>
A higher level of technology and safety equipment has reduced the likelihood of 
an oil spill such as the one that occurred at a platform off Santa Barbara in 
1969, Getts said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, turbines driven by natural gas, which supply electricity for Ellen and 
Elly, have greatly reduced the amount of air pollution from the days when the 
earlier platforms were powered by diesel generators, he added. 
</P>
<P>
A new federal lease sale of oil sites off the county's coast is scheduled for 
some time in 1990, Getts said. 
</P>
<P>
There has never been a major malfunction of the Ellen-Elly complex or an oil 
spill since it has been in operation, Kachelhoffer said, although crew members 
got a scare immediately after the Mexico City earthquake when they were warned 
that a tsunami generated by the quake might hit the platforms. 
</P>
<P>
"That was about the biggest scare we've had out there," he said. "We were 
wondering about it and waiting for it to hit, but it never materialized. We 
were going to stay aboard until there was a visual sighting in San Diego, but 
it turned out to be only a 2-foot wave." 
</P>
<P>
Vandivort said, "We're taught that the last thing we want to do is go in the 
water. And we look out for our brothers." 
</P>
<P>
The platforms, he said, can withstand extremely high seas and earthquakes of 
intensities up to 8.0. And, he added, if an explosion or unmanageable fire 
occurs, the entire crew can escape from the complex in a self-righting escape 
capsule that is diesel-powered and can sail through flaming oil after being 
lowered into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
When the crew uses the capsule for something, he said, "people really look at 
us strangely when they're out there in their yachts, and we're puttin' around 
in this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Dire thoughts seldom occur to the workers, however. Vandivort said crew members 
look forward to sunny weather, when they can dangle a fishing line over the 
side and perhaps land a migrating yellowtail. They think of the days when 
whales and dolphins swim past, and when the lower catwalk is covered with sea 
lions sunning themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen this whole deck just piled with seals," Vandivort said. "And they 
know how to climb up the stairs. One year, one little baby made it all the way 
up to the galley level." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Huben said, practical jokes are rampant. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have a bad day," he said, "and someone will play a practical joke on 
you to lighten things up. Cornflakes or croutons in your bed, for instance. And 
you inevitably get (squirted with a hose) on your birthday." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the life is cramped, isolated and complex. The workers, however, agreed 
that their ultimate aim was not. Through wind and lightning and earthquakes and 
tsunami scares and high seas and equipment breakdowns and endless safety checks 
and drills, each crew member, Kachelhoffer said, remains single-minded about 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole objective," he said, straight-faced, "is to do the job and get home 
in one piece."

San Clemente was tagged the Spanish Village-by-the-Sea by its founding father, 
Ole Hanson. The one-time politician and full-time real estate developer dreamed 
of building a Spanish-style village with mandatory white stucco houses and all 
wearing red tile roofs. Most residents thought him to be somewhat crazy, but in 
December, 1925, he put his 2,000 acres in lots up for sale. By August, 1926, 
all his units were sold for more than $3 million. On the first day alone, sales 
totaled $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Today, this portion of the county is heavily populated by retirees and 
executive commuters. The southernmost tip is the oldest and most established 
section of the city. It features wide streets meandering throughout, always 
conforming to the contours of the hills. For many, houses are situated to 
provide a great ocean view. 
</P>
<P>
Landscaped with palm and other exotic trees and shrubs is the 100-acre San 
Clemente State Beach. At present, the campground has 85 sites for conventional 
vehicles and 72 spots for recreational vehicles and all the usual campsite 
amenities. The beach is about to undergo a $1.5 million face-lift with 
completion scheduled for sometime in the summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Trestles -- located southeast of the Orange County-San Diego county line -- is 
one of the most widely known surfing beaches on the California coast. This 
world-class surfing spot was named by surfers for the wooden train trestles 
that rise above the sand inland from the waves. On any given day, you can still 
see the Santa Fe and Amtrak trains crossing the trestles as surfers glide 
through the waves just off the point. Sometimes, migrating whales can be 
spotted. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-foot San Clemente Municipal Pier was built in 1928 by Hanson. The 
pier was severely damaged by a storm in 1983, but was totally renovated in 
1985. The pier is adjacent to the Amtrak station, which is a popular 
disembarking point for beach-goers from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
La Casa Pacifica (which means "house of peace" in Spanish), a 28-acre, 
bluff-top estate once called the "Western White House," was opened in August 
1969 by former President Richard M. Nixon. The constant influx of visiting 
dignitaries kept Orange County in the news. Five years after resigning from the 
presidency in the wake of Watergate in August, 1974, Nixon sold the property 
and left California. 
</P>
<P>
This small, sleepy community is constantly growing, but not as rapidly as most 
Orange County communities. Property owners plan on keeping its growth rate 
down, so as not to lose its national recognition or its ocean-front elegance.

LIFE ON WHEELS: A TRAFFIC JAM OF IDEAS FLOODS OCTC ON HOW TO GREASE THE WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HOFMANN , Jan Hofmann is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's at least one good thing about all the time we spend stuck in traffic. 
It gives us plenty of time to think, especially about ways to avoid getting 
stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
And we have been wearing our thinking caps, haven't we? So many county drivers 
have thought up and sent in suggestions for the Orange County Transportation 
Commission's "100 Traffic Solutions" project that the OCTC might have to change 
the name to "1,000 Traffic Solutions" -- if the list can be pared down just to 
that. 
</P>
<P>
As of Dec. 30, officially the last day for submissions, more than 750 people 
had written to the commission with an average of three suggestions each. One 
man sent in his own list of 100 ideas. The commission has more than 2,000 ideas 
to sift through. 
</P>
<P>
All that volunteer brainstorming did give at least one OCTC staffer some time 
off, as I suggested last week, from her work on the commission's 20-year plan 
for the county. But instead of going shopping or attending a matinee, Melanie 
Lane, an intern in the community and governmental section, spent that time in 
front of a computer, entering and categorizing the responses. 
</P>
<P>
While she worked, I pulled up a chair and dug through the pile of letters, 
careful not to interfere with her system. At that point Lane had fed 789 
suggestions -- about a third -- into the computer. 
</P>
<P>
She made me a printout of her tabulations-in-progress, from which I did a few 
calculations to assess the early returns. 
</P>
<P>
Now I confess I'm no Tom Brokaw, but on the basis of Lane's work and my own 
sampling, I'm ready to project some winners. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest winner: Rail, with 107 votes, or just under 14% of the running 
total. Various forms of monorails were the most popular proposals within this 
category, followed by suggestions for expansion of Amtrak's existing service, a 
subway or a resurrection of the old Pacific Electric Red Cars. 
</P>
<P>
One correspondent even suggested removing the wings from airplanes and loading 
them on flatbed rail cars to create makeshift passenger trains. Another 
suggested a train that could ferry cars above the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
Not coincidentally, the commission has already asked for a comprehensive study 
of rail system possibilities, says Brea Councilwoman Clarice A. Blamer, a 
member of OCTC and chairwoman of the 100 Traffic Solutions committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really pleased to see so many suggestions for things that we're already 
doing," Blamer says. "That makes us feel we're on the right track." 
</P>
<P>
So to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Freeways came in second, with 83 ideas, or more than 10% of the suggestions. 
Most of those entail more freeways, wider freeways, double-decker freeways, 
freeways with reversible lanes and better-maintained freeways. But a couple of 
correspondents said, "Don't build any more." 
</P>
<P>
The third most popular topic -- raising money to implement the ideas -- proves 
this is not only a creative group but a responsible one -- except, of course, 
for the handful who resorted to calling the commissioners nasty names (effete 
snobs? That one went out with Spiro Agnew), or the person who anonymously 
suggested that we eliminate congestion by "killing all the Republicans." 
(Whaddaya want, a ghost town?) 
</P>
<P>
Of the ideas tallied so far, 82 -- about 1 in 10 -- had to do with raising 
money through everything from new taxes to tolls to a transportation funds 
telethon. 
</P>
<P>
In fourth place: Trucks, with 55 suggestions, or just less than 7% of the early 
tabulations. Most of those involved restricting the hours trucks are permitted 
on freeways or even surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
Buses and working hours tied for fifth place, with 48 suggestions each. 
</P>
<P>
Bus riders -- or potential bus riders -- want more direct routes, more express 
buses, more frequent buses and buses that link up with that rail system we 
mentioned earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Staggered or flexible working hours were the most frequently mentioned in that 
category, although my personal favorites were suggestions to reduce the workday 
to 5 hours and give everybody an extra day off once a month. 
</P>
<P>
Other categories included improvements to arterial streets, incentives for 
everything from car pools to working at home to 4-day workweeks, synchronizing 
traffic signals, either eliminating car-pool lanes or creating more of them, 
controlling growth, better driver education and "other." 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence H. Alderson of Tustin was the guy who came up with his own list of 100 
ideas. The most interesting of those involved paving over the Santa Ana and 
other rivers to create fair-weather freeways. Alderson also suggested building 
"a freeway on floating platforms in the ocean" as an alternative to 
double-decking, although he called both ideas "expensive and outlandish." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of those who wrote liked the idea of soliciting public reaction, 
some didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Why don't you stop (expletive)ing around with surveys and build more roads?" 
wrote M. Wagner of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
And an anonymous correspondent wrote, "Use your traffic engineers! Doctors 
don't stop people on the street and ask them how to do brain surgery!" 
</P>
<P>
Dissenters aside, Blamer says she's thrilled at the overwhelming response: 
"People out there are saying that we're part of the problem, so we're going to 
be part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
Once the suggestions have been tabulated, Blamer and the 100 Traffic Solutions 
committee will begin sorting through them. "The ones that we can implement 
immediately, we're going to do," she says. "If we can't, if they're going to 
take some study, then at least we can include these ideas in the study." 
</P>
<P>
Although a few ideas -- eliminating Republicans or immigrants or people from 
back East, for example -- can't be taken seriously, Blamer says with those few 
exceptions, "I don't think there's any that are absolutely ridiculous, except 
for making people move out of the county. We're not going to get into running 
people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
In choosing the top 100, Blamer says, "We're going to concentrate on getting 
the most results for the least money." 
</P>
<P>
And that means double-decking freeways probably won't make the cut. "I can't 
say for sure because I don't have all the facts, but that's probably the least 
likely suggestion." 
</P>
<P>
Although many ideas will need further study, "We don't want to study it to 
death," Blamer says. 
</P>
<P>
As an agency that exists primarily to coordinate the work of other governmental 
agencies, the OCTC doesn't have the power to implement many of the suggestions 
that have come in. "There are lots of things that we're expected to do that we 
don't have the authority to do," Blamer says. "But maybe we should look into 
legislation that would give us that authority." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Blamer says, the mailbox is still open. "I don't want people to 
think that there was just a certain period when we were accepting suggestions. 
Anytime anybody has an idea for something that would make things better, we 
want to hear about it."

ASK THE VET: OWNER WONDERS WHY CAT DOESN'T PURR IT ON THICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. GLENN ERICSON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
QDo all cats purr? We have three cats at home, and the one female rarely purrs 
at all, while the other two cats purr loudly with any attention. Could there be 
something wrong with her that might make it difficult for her to purr? 
</P>
<P>
Andy Baldwin, 
</P>
<P>
Orange 
</P>
<P>
A The mechanism that causes purring in cats is still not well-understood, and 
the reasons for purring seem to be quite varied. Most cats will purr as a sign 
of contentment or pleasure, especially when petted or in anticipation of being 
fed. I have seen cats, however, purr when in pain or fear, apparently in an 
effort to calm themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Cats have individual responses to stimuli, and the fact that one does not purr 
very often does not mean there is a problem. Some cats purr so softly that it 
can be felt rather than heard. Unless your cat shows some signs of a 
respiratory problem or difficulty swallowing, I wouldn't worry. You might 
mention this to your veterinarian on your pet's next visit and have him or her 
check the throat and neck for any possible abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
QI have a 7-year-old miniature poodle that has had a bad ear infection for the 
past year. Every 3 months, I have to take her to the vet to have her ears 
flushed and to get antibiotics and ointment. The infection always recurs after 
she runs out of medicine. Is it harmful for her to continue using antibiotics 
for a long period of time, and is there anything else that can stop the 
infection? My vet says it is very common in floppy-eared dogs. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy Villalobos, 
</P>
<P>
Rowland Heights 
</P>
<P>
A Chronic ear infections are often very difficult to treat and clear up in dogs 
unless aggressive treatment is used. It is true that dogs with thick floppy 
ears often have more ear problems than those with erect ears, although that may 
be because minor problems go unnoticed by the owner until they progress to more 
serious infections. 
</P>
<P>
Treating a chronic ear infection should start with a thorough ear lavage, 
preferably done under sedation or anesthesia, in order to completely clear the 
canal of debris and wax. If your dog has been on the same antibiotics all this 
time, your vet may want to culture the infection before flushing the ear canals 
and try to identify the organisms involved and possibly select a more effective 
antibiotic. A smear of the wax or debris may be necessary to rule out a mite 
infestation. Once the ears are clean and dry, they will be reexamined for 
ulcers and to judge the size of the canal. A topical antibiotic solution should 
be used in the ears. 
</P>
<P>
At home, you will need to clean your pet's ear thoroughly and medicate it 
daily. Weekly examinations may be necessary to follow the course of treatment 
and determine if changes are necessary. Oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory 
medication may be necessary for up to 6 weeks if the infection is severe 
enough. In some severe cases, surgery may be necessary.

GUYS AND GALLLEYS: GRANDMA'S NO-FUSS FUDGE RECIPE CREATED A RUCKUS WHEN TIME 
CAME TO COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE SPENCER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We're going to start the new year off by cleaning up the old-year mess we 
created -- judging from the letters and phone calls -- in many Orange County 
kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
The Grandma's No-Fuss Cashew Fudge recipe we carried several weeks ago turned 
out to be star-crossed indeed. First, we inadvertently omitted a key direction 
(to melt the butter and chocolate by pouring boiling syrup over it), something 
we corrected two days later. 
</P>
<P>
Then we began receiving calls from readers who seemed most rankled at the line 
in the article that said anyone who "could boil water or plug in a mixer," 
including a 10-year-old of our acquaintance, could make the fudge with ease. It 
seems they could not. 
</P>
<P>
"I can boil water and I can use an electric mixer," fumed June Drury, "but what 
a mess I got into trying to make Granny's fudge!" 
</P>
<P>
Toba V. Wheeler of Irvine agreed. "As I was stirring and stirring and stirring, 
. . . I wondered how on earth a 10-year-old could possibly have the strength 
and stamina to perform the chore -- I was exhausted before I even put the pan 
on the stove." 
</P>
<P>
She wound up with "a bowlful of granulated sugar globs and hard sugar lumps and 
these, too, started flying out of the (mixer) bowl and all over the counter, 
walls, floor, hands and blouse." 
</P>
<P>
"That was the final straw and I gave up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
We were, if possible, more perplexed than they. It is, after all, an old family 
recipe -- tested and proved through several generations of use. 
</P>
<P>
But both Wheeler and Drury hit on the problem in their respective letters. 
</P>
<P>
"I have made tons of fudge, but . . . I thought this (recipe) was special since 
it called for condensed milk, instead of evaporated milk," Drury said. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Wheeler: " . . . There is no way 4 1/2 cups of sugar could dissolve in 12 
ounces of condensed milk." 
</P>
<P>
That, indeed, was the wrinkle. The ingredients should have read evaporated 
milk, not condensed. So we are reprinting the corrected recipe this week, with 
apologies to those who wrote or called and also those who didn't. And to those 
whose smoke alarms were activated by neighbors laboring over Grandma's no-fuss 
fudge. 
</P>
<P>
We also managed to ruffle a few other feathers during the holidays by not 
telling readers where they could purchase a key ingredient -- plums and tapioca 
-- in the sugarplum cake recipe published the week before Christmas. The 
answer: in the junior baby foods section of any supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
Other than these two omissions, Guys &amp; Galleys enjoyed an interesting and 
positive year. 
</P>
<P>
The guys who shared their recipes during 1988 -- and the recipes themselves -- 
mirrored the county's remarkable social, economic and ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
The contributors ranged from an unemployed construction worker to a master of 
high finance. Scattered in between were several attorneys, a punk rock 
musician, a publicist, a couple of retirees, a bartender, a psychologist, a 
comedian and a doctor, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Their recipes also ran the gamut, from French and Italian to German and 
Oriental, from Mexican to Spanish (there's a big difference), from Mideastern 
to Midwestern. 
</P>
<P>
We nibbled on buffalo wings with a bartender in San Juan Capistrano and sampled 
barbecued fish aboard an advertising executive's yacht in Newport Harbor. We 
also strolled with an author-musician-therapist through his herb garden in 
Corona del Mar and slurped clam chowder brewed on the beach by a band of 
lifeguards in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
We thank them all for sharing their recipes and for taking the time to prepare 
the dishes for our photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's time to rustle up some cooks for the new year. If you are a guy who 
likes to cook -- or know one -- drop us a line at Guys &amp; Galleys, Orange 
County Life, The Times, 1365 Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626.

<P>
THE CORRECTED GRANDMA'S NO-FUSS CASHEW FUDGE 
</P>
<P>
Ingredients 
</P>
<P>
4 1/2 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 twelve-ounce can evaporated milk 
</P>
<P>
12 one-ounce squares bittersweet chocolate 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound butter 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon vanilla, brandy or rum 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound cashew pieces 
</P>
<P>
Preparation 
</P>
<P>
In a large heavy saucepan, mix sugar and evaporated milk. Sprinkle on 1/2 
teaspoon salt. Mix again and slowly bring mixture to bubbling boil. Immediately 
reduce heat and simmer for 14 minutes, stirring frequently. While sugar-milk 
mixture is cooking, break chocolate pieces in half, place in large mixing bowl 
and add butter in chunks. Sprinkle on remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. Remove 
sugar-milk mixture from heat and pour over butter and chocolate. Blend with 
electric mixer on low. Increase speed of mixer to high and beat for 10 minutes. 
Add vanilla, rum or brandy and nuts. Mix with spoon and spread in buttered 
pans. Chill several hours.

DISCOVERY: NATURE STILL REIGNS IN THIS OAK CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT , Patrick Mott is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two tracts of Anaheim Hills land are a modern study in contrasts. On one 
side of Walnut Canyon Road is the Anaheim Hills Golf Course, closely tended, 
carefully groomed, a series of finely sculpted undulating carpets of uniform 
green fairways and minutely clipped and pampered greens. It is a place where 
the cooing of quail is something that upsets your putting stroke and a 3-iron 
is needed to deal with rattlesnakes. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the road is the Oak Canyon Nature Center, where both the 
quail and the snakes, if they show up in the right place at the right time, 
likely will get a free meal and a few hundred curious looks each week. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the Anaheim city parks systems, the nature center is one corner of 
Anaheim Hills where the original tenants -- the local animals -- still hold the 
lease. In a highly developed residential section of Orange County, it has 
remained a place where humans are still the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Set into a canyon in one of the hills, the nature center is covered by nearly 6 
miles of hiking trails, many of which border a stream that cascades along the 
canyon bottom. It is a specialized sort of park, said center director Cathy 
Glasgow, in that it exists primarily to satisfy the sense of sight. Picnicking, 
cycling, smoking, pets, rock or leaf collecting and other activities that are 
often permissible in other city parks are taboo in an area in which field mice 
and frogs run the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Take away only memories; leave nothing but footprints" is the primary rule 
posted at the entrance to the center. 
</P>
<P>
Not that there aren't opportunities for hands-on activities. Just inside the 
entrance is a building housing the facility's interpretive center, a 
combination museum and classroom designed primarily for schoolchildren. On 
display are dozens of live and mounted birds, reptiles, rodents and other 
animals (mounted specimens were found dead in the wild, Glasgow said), as well 
as areas set up for games and other activities, such as a microscope table, 
relevant to the study of nature. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the center's visitors, Glasgow said, are elementary school children, 
who are taken on guided tours by one of the center's 10 part-time naturalists. 
But, she added, programs are also available for adults, handicapped visitors 
and senior citizens. These programs are offered by prior arrangement, and fees 
are set at $1 to $3.20 per person, depending upon the length of the tour -- 45 
minutes to 3 hours -- and the variety of subjects covered by the naturalists. 
</P>
<P>
However, Glasgow said, many visitors, particularly on weekends, come simply to 
walk one or all of the eight trails that wind through the canyon. She cautioned 
that walkers should familiarize themselves with poison ivy and poison oak, both 
indigenous to the canyon, and should stay on the trails to avoid contact with 
either. Also, she said, in warmer weather rattlesnakes are sometimes seen, 
although they tend to shy away from contact with humans and usually present no 
danger to on-trail hikers.

Recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences and its affiliated National 
Academy of Engineering and National Institute of Medicine were in the form of

FRUSTRATED WALSH MOVES TO DISMISS NORTH'S CONSPIRACY, THEFT CHARGES 
</P>

<P>
Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, citing "difficult classified information 
problems," moved today to dismiss the two central charges against fired 
National Security Council aide Oliver L. North in the Iran-Contra case. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he sought to dismiss the conspiracy and theft charges because of 
North's insistence on disclosing large amounts of secret information and the 
Reagan Administration's refusal to declassify many documents. 
</P>
<P>
Dismissal of the criminal conspiracy charges would make it unlikely that the 
full story of the scandal, which is still not known, would come out at North's 
trial, which is set to begin Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
In resisting North's disclosure request, intelligence officials have cited 
concerns over national security. 
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to simplify the charges have not eliminated the risk that a quantity 
of classified national security information would be compromised by a public 
trial" on the conspiracy and theft charges, Walsh said in the brief motion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Charges Remain 
</P>
<P>
If U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell approves Walsh's motion, there still 
would be a dozen criminal charges remaining against North, including 
obstruction of Congress in 1985 and 1986, and concealing and destroying 
documents in connection with a 1986 inquiry into the affair by then-Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese III. North also is charged with converting travelers' checks to his 
own use and accepting a free security system installed at his home. 
</P>
<P>
He faces up to 60 years in prison and a $3-million fine if convicted on those 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's move came a day after he met with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to discuss 
the continuing problems posed by classified documents both sides want to use in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
It was at that meeting that Walsh told the attorney general he planned to seek 
dismissal of the two charges, the Justice Department said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, facing a new round of lobbying for a presidential pardon for 
North, had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
The conspiracy and theft of government property charges were the main counts 
against North in the case accusing him of selling missiles to Iran and 
diverting some of the profits from those sales to the Nicaraguan Contras. 
</P>
<P>
In the initial indictment, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter 
and middlemen Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim were named in these two 
counts. Their trials were severed from North's and have not been scheduled yet 
and today's motion will likely result in dismissal of the same charges against 
Poindexter, Hakim and Secord.

Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci announced today that he had approved a 
recommendation to close dozens of military bases across the country, calling 
the action "long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci declared at a Pentagon briefing, "The department has wanted to close 
bases for many years. . . . I would like to reiterate that this is a unique 
opportunity to make significant changes to (the department's) base structure 
(that) will not only save taxpayer dollars but also improve our nation's 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
He said he will ask Congress for $500 million in the fiscal 1990 budget and 
another $500 million in the 1991 budget to help cover expenses of closing 
military bases. 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci also said that he would like to see even more bases closed but that he 
isn't about to tamper with the political compromise that produced the current 
closing list. He added that the Defense Department might be able to close some 
of the bases even more quickly than envisioned by the special commission that 
prepared the list. 
</P>
<P>
"Base closings are long overdue," Carlucci said. 
</P>
<P>
Adm. William J. Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told 
reporters that he and the other leaders of the armed services supported the 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
"It is our view as a body that this action would not adversely affect military 
operations or the ability to carry out the national military strategy," Crowe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlucci's decision, which was expected, sets the stage for one final debate on 
the matter on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Under a law passed last year, a special government commission was given the 
authority to review all military facilities and to prepare a hit list of those 
considered obsolete or unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Carlucci has endorsed the panel's recommendations, Congress must 
either accept or reject the list of bases proposed for closure in its entirety. 
It cannot pick and choose or bargain over the fate of individual bases on the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
The commission -- known formally as the Base Realignment and Closure Commission 
-- has recommended that 34 military installations and 52 military housing 
complexes be closed; that five other installations be partially closed, and 
that 54 others get new missions or additional personnel. 
</P>
<P>
All told, the panel has estimated the actions would save $693 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the California bases listed to be closed is the Army's historic Presidio 
in San Francisco. Letterman Army Medical Center on that base also would be shut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, Norton Air Force Base near San Bernardino and George 
AFB near Victorville would be closed with some personnel and functions 
transferred to March AFB near Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Mather AFB near Sacramento also would be closed.

3 AFRICANS ADMIT BREAKING CHINA'S LAW;

1 REMAINS JAILED AFTER BRAWL TRIGGERED RACIAL UNREST IN 4 CITIES

Three African students held by police in connection with a brawl that triggered 
racial unrest in four cities have admitted that they broke the law, an official 
report said today. 
</P>
<P>
One of the three remained under arrest in the eastern city of Nanking, 
apparently facing trial, while two others were being punished with 15 days of 
"disciplinary detention," the Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth African was released and returned to his school this evening, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
In related developments, about 45 African students held 10 days at a guest 
house after the brawl returned to their university in Nanking today. 
</P>
<P>
In Hangzhou, about 150 miles to the southeast, African students ended a 10-day 
class boycott after their college's president agreed to give them a direct 
telephone line and write an open letter saying none has acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
Ghana warned that it might recall its students because of the treatment of the 
Africans. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Hangzhou and Nanking, racial incidents have occurred in Beijing and 
Wuhan, an industrial city in central China. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents began Dec. 24 in Nanking, when African students refused to 
register their Chinese girlfriends to attend a dance at Hehai University. The 
disagreement led to a fight and nearly a week of anti-African protests by 
Chinese youths. 
</P>
<P>
Xinhua said Alex Dosoo of Ghana beat and seriously hurt a university worker 
during the brawl. He was the only African to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said Alpha Robinson of Gambia and Dossoumou Boni Lodovic of 
Benin "tried to stir up trouble" during the fight and were being given 15 days' 
detention under China's public order regulations. All three admitted they broke 
the law, it said without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
The four were among about 140 students, most from Africa, who tried to flee to 
Beijing in the face of the Chinese protests but were taken by police to a guest 
house outside Nanking and held incommunicado. 
</P>
<P>
The four were taken into custody Saturday at the guest house by about 400 
police who, according to fellow students and African diplomats, used electric 
cattle prods and wooden clubs. Chinese officials deny any violence was used. 
</P>
<P>
Police took most of the other students back to Nanking, but 45 remained at the 
guest house until today, when they returned to school voluntarily in order to 
meet with a group of African diplomats.

Carolina Prokofiev, widow of the celebrated Russian composer Serge Prokofiev, 
has died of cancer in London, her son said today. She was 91. 
</P>
<P>
Carolina Prokofiev, who survived a Soviet prison camp, narrated her husband's 
classic children's work "Peter and the Wolf" two years ago at Lincoln Center in 
New York to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the work. She died Tuesday about 
three months after falling ill, said her son, Oleg Prokofiev. In 1948, 
Prokofiev was one of the composers denounced by the Stalin government for 
writing "bourgeois" music. His wife was accused of having contact with 
anti-Soviet elements and was sent to Ubez prison camp in the northern Urals. 
Prokofiev died in 1953 and she was freed three years later.

BONN FINDS NO PROOF OF AID TO LIBYAN FACTORY

West German financial examiners found no proof to support U.S. allegations that 
a West German firm helped build a plant in Libya designed to produce chemical 
weapons, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ended an investigation of the Imhausen-Chemie company in 
southwest Baden-Wurttemberg state. The federal Finance Ministry ordered the 
company's records examined in response to the U.S. claims. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no evidence of illegal exports," Freiburg District Director Willi 
Voegele told reporters after delivering results of the inquiry to the company 
offices in Lahr, 130 miles south of Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
Voegele said the inquiry had not found any evidence to show that "the company 
or its branches sold pieces of chemical (plant) equipment to Libya from 1984 
until today." 
</P>
<P>
"They also have not helped with plans or with specialized knowledge," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, managing director of the company, repeated his 
denials of the U.S. allegations, saying the firm had "nothing -- absolutely 
nothing -- to do with this 'Libyan tale.' " 
</P>
<P>
Also today, the West German government said five other West German companies 
"in all probability" provided Iraq with materials that can be used to make 
chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
No charges have been filed in that case, which came to official attention 
before the allegations against Imhausen-Chemie surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
The government said the companies under investigation are Walter Engineer 
Trading of Hamburg, the Karl Kolb company of Dreieich, Pilot Plant of Dreieich, 
Preussag of Hanover and Heberberger Bau of Schifferstadt. 
</P>
<P>
The British government, meanwhile, joined the United States in claiming to have 
proof that the Libyan plant was designed to produce chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The statement Wednesday night from the Foreign Office was the first comment by 
British officials on U.S. allegations and other reports that Libya built the 
plant to make chemical weapons, including poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
"This information shows that the plant is very large and that there is no doubt 
it is intended for chemical warfare production," a Foreign Office spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shultz Begins Tour 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Secretary of State George P. Shultz left Washington for Europe today 
on a mission to persuade more than 100 nations to impose sanctions on countries 
that use poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
He also planned to urge foreign ministers and ambassadors assembling for a 
five-day conference in Paris to strengthen the hand of U.N. Secretary General 
Javier Perez de Cuellar in investigating allegations of chemical warfare. 
</P>
<P>
The skirmish Wednesday over the Mediterranean in which U.S. Navy jet fighters 
shot down two Libyan MIG-23 planes acted as a backdrop for the conference, 
which opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris conference was proposed by President Reagan in September.

The Buenos Aires-bound Flight 201 was on the runway and ready for takeoff 
Tuesday when airport police received a call from a woman saying a bomb was

The plane was cleared for takeoff about four hours behind schedule after an

<P>
Wyse Technology, a maker of personal computers and terminals, said today that 
it plans to cut its 3,800-person work force by 15% and expects to report a loss 
for the nine months ended Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Wyse, based in San Jose, also said its president and chief operating officer, 
Phillip E. White, has resigned to join Informix Corp., effective today. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the work force reduction, which will take place through 
layoffs and attrition, involves about 560 positions worldwide. About 400 are 
being eliminated in its Far East manufacturing operations, with the balance 
from other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Wyse said the reduction is being implemented in light of its third-quarter 
revenues, which the company previously said would fall below $100 million, 
yielding a loss for the quarter ended Dec. 30. The company said it now expects 
revenues of between $60 million and $70 million for the third quarter and a 
loss for the nine-month period.

publication's award. 
</P>
<P>
The 40th annual award was presented at a preview of the North American 
International Auto Show. The performance version of the all-new Thunderbird is 
powered by a supercharged V-6 engine and sells for about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Other nominees for the award, coveted because of its use in advertising, were 
Chrysler Corp.'s new Plymouth Acclaim LX and Dodge Spirit ES compacts, and 
Ford's Mercury Cougar XR-7, which is similar to the Thunderbird and is also 
powered by a supercharged V-6.

Bankers Trust New York Corp. has agreed to take a 49% stake in French

Didier Philippe said in a statement that the New York-based bank would not take

<P>
It gave no financial details of the deal, but sources close to the operation 
said the New York bank was expected to pay about 125 million francs ($20.4 
million) for the stake, although the precise figure had not yet been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
The deal brings to about 30 the number of Paris brokers that have sold stakes 
to French and foreign financial institutions in the last year since a new 
Bourse (the Paris stock market) law opened brokers' capital to outside

Chrysler Corp. has agreed to pay $5.1 million to about 150 former employees in 
a settlement of an age-discrimination lawsuit filed in 1981 by a federal 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claimed in its suit against 
Chrysler Motors Corp., the auto makers manufacturing arm, that the salaried 
workers were forced to retire because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
The case had been scheduled for trial Tuesday, but Chrysler agreed Dec. 30 to 
the settlement, under which it admitted no liability or wrongdoing. The auto 
maker reached a $2.9-million settlement earlier last month with 82 other former 
salaried workers. The commission was to determine how the money would be 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
The case originally sought compensation for more than 1,600 employees allegedly 
forced to retire between 1978 and 1981, when Chrysler was near bankruptcy, said 
Tom Keenbaum, a Detroit attorney representing the ex-workers.

Dick Versace, the Detroit Pistons assistant who arrived in town in time to 
watch the Indiana Pacers snap a nine-game losing streak, was named head coach 
of the Pacers today. 
</P>
<P>
He arrived Wednesday night, 30 minutes before the tip-off of the Pacers game 
with Atlanta. Indiana won 116-113. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not accept losing from this team or any team that I coach," Versace 
told a news conference this morning. "When I'm introduced to the players, that 
will be my opening statement and we'll go on from there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
To Work on Defense 
</P>
<P>
Versace promised that the first thing he will work on will be defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like everyone to say that's a very fine defensive team. That's a team 
you're never going to be able to run on. You always have to play them five on 
five." 
</P>
<P>
Versace, 48, is the third leadership change this season for the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
Interim coach George Irvine took over nine games into the season after Jack 
Ramsay resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Versace, former head coach for Bradley University, said on arrival Wednesday 
that "I've been in this situation before. When a man is working at his craft, 
it's always great to work in an area where it's appreciated, and it isn't 
appreciated any more than in this city and in this state." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "We certainly like to think we can together and collectively build 
this thing into something the state can be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good coach, and I think he's suited to our team," Pacers General 
Manager Donnie Walsh said. "I think he has got the proper elements in his 
personality and coaching philosophy to turn it around and continue what we want 
to do in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I interviewed had a great technology of the game, knowledge of the 
game. Dick put life into it, intensity into it. It was just the whole 
combination. I think he has the technical knowledge, experience as head coach, 
experience in the NBA and putting in proper things as a head coach." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh also interviewed NBA assistant coaches Allan Bristow of Denver, Bill 
Blair of Washington and Frank Hamblen of Milwaukee.

Dave Bristol, a former Cincinnati Reds manager who was the Philadelphia 
Phillies' third base coach last season, has been hired as Cincinnati's third 
base coach for 1989, the Reds announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol, 55, who was the Reds' manager from 1966 to 1969, was Philadelphia's 
third base coach until mid-season in 1988, when he was fired along with 
Phillies manager Lee Elia. The Reds said Bristol will be assigned uniform No. 
4, the same number he wore when he managed the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
He will replace Bruce Kimm, who left the Reds in November to become a bench 
coach with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bristol also managed at Milwaukee (1970-72), 
Atlanta (1976-77) and San Francisco (1979-80), compiling a 658-764 record. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol's new boss, Reds manager Pete Rose, played for Bristol in the major 
leagues and the minor leagues. Bristol was a manager in the Reds' farm system 
for nine years before taking over the Reds in July, 1966, when Don Heffner was 
fired as manager. Bristol guided the Reds to a 39-38 record and a seventh-place 
finish.

A 3-year-old child was trapped by flames and killed today in a fire that swept 
through a house and spread to an adjacent building in the unincorporated Walnut 
Hills area near the City of Industry, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at the house on Flintgate Drive shortly after 10 a.m., Los 
Angeles County Fire Inspector Chuck Gutierrez said. "The report initially came 
in on 911 that a person was trapped," department spokeswoman Esther Witler 
said. When firefighters arrived, they found the child dead. It was not 
immediately known whether the victim was a boy or girl. There were no other 
reports of injuries.
