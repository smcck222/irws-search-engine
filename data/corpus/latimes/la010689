'SKY OF THE MIND': DARK PROFUNDITY OF MORRIS GRAVES

<P>
In almost any company, Morris Graves' painting shrinks into the dark. His 
intensely personal, contemplative work is the antithesis of the "action 
painting" turned out by his contemporaries, the Abstract Expressionists. 
</P>
<P>
Seen in the broader perspective of modern art history, usually characterized as 
a parade of bold moves, Graves' archetypal images of blind birds and nocturnal 
beasts are a pacific aberration. He's an Oriental thinker amid Occidental 
doers, an inspired wallflower at the prom. 
</P>
<P>
A current exhibition at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art reinforces this view of 
one of the most revered artists ever to work in the Pacific Northwest. "Sky of 
the Mind: Morris Graves 1937-1987" (to Feb. 12) seems oddly out of sync with a 
sampling of modernist works from the museum's collection and a vigorous array 
of recently made sculpture in "Figurative Impulses," organized by Nancy Doll, 
the museum's new curator of 20th-Century art. Both of those shows loudly 
proclaim their Zeitgeist while Graves' paintings reverberate from the deep. 
</P>
<P>
Familiar as they may be, there's something profoundly strange about many of 
Graves' images, and that is part of their power. 
</P>
<P>
What are we to make of this congregation of coiled snakes, burrowing rodents 
and slithering eels? What of the recurring talons that sprout from the base of 
a dragon-headed snake, appear as a great gray heron's oversize feet or simply 
emerge in the dark, along with a hand that grows into a human foot? A "Joyous 
Young Pine" that raises its branches to the heavens and basks in a rosy glow? 
Ocean waves that fly through the air and wrap themselves around a vase? 
</P>
<P>
Graves may rail against modern incursions against nature, as in "Machine Age 
Noise No. 2," which depicts two bolts of angry noise hurtling through space, 
but he is more than an environmentalist. He may accurately portray three Canada 
jays eating an avocado, but he isn't a latter-day Audubon. Even without titles 
such as "Spirit Bird" or images of mandalas and "Tantra Yantras," it is clear 
that Graves is concerned with a spiritual presence and mystical states of 
being. His is an art of heightened sensitivity honed on Zen Buddhism and 
Vedanta philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1910 in Fox Valley, Ore., Graves worked in the Far East as a seaman on 
mail ships before becoming a painter, and his youthful travels to Japan and 
elsewhere had a lasting effect on his art. He was awarded a Guggenheim 
Fellowship to study in Japan in 1946 but was not allowed to enter the country 
during the occupation. Working mainly in Seattle, he returned to Japan in 1963 
and traveled throughout the Far East from 1971 to 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Graves translated these experiences into Oriental motifs and objects, such as 
dragons and bronzes, and into styles that emulate calligraphy, scrolls or 
painted screens. Essentially self-taught, he also assimilated Surrealism (a 
1944 "Landscape" contains vestiges of Miro) and studied briefly with Mark 
Tobey, a prominent Northwest artist whose automatic "white writing" appears in 
some of Graves' early work. Early on, Graves painted with oil, but he is 
primarily known for working in the more ephemeral media of tempera, gouache, 
ink and watercolor. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these influences, Graves developed an individual visionary style. As we 
see in about 50 works in the Santa Barbara exhibition (organized by the Schmidt 
Bingham Gallery in New York), his subjects run from spooky animals and 
ritualistic circles to vases of wispy flowers and an expansive armchair. 
</P>
<P>
There's a fairly sharp and surprising change of mood from one gallery to 
another here -- the first housing the dark, bewitching works of the '40s and 
'50s, the second offering more colorful, prosaic images of the '70s. But the 
sense of ambiguous space and inner direction throughout the show is vintage 
Graves. 
</P>
<P>
His flowers, like his animals, suggest the fragility of living things and the 
natural cycles of life. Often painted in nursery boxes or portrayed as "Winter 
Bouquets," the blooms are in transit, and they seem nearly as vulnerable as the 
hawks and owls that emerge from dark backgrounds of early works. While the 
later paintings lack Graves' characteristic mystical charge, they hint at 
nocturnal mysteries and speak of energies that are felt rather than seen. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the spiritual strains of modern art are being examined in galleries 
and museums, and now that the Pacific Rim is acknowledged as a source of 
aesthetic riches, Graves is probably a prime candidate for enshrinement. That 
makes an essentially timeless art seem timely, but Graves is one of the art 
world's private poets who neither profit nor perish in the limelight. Their 
strength depends on not fitting in.

Teen-age actress Drew Barrymore got into drinking because she wanted to imitate 
relatives in the legendary Barrymore theater family, some of whom drank 
heavily, she says in an interview to be broadcast Monday on ABC's "Good Morning 
America." Barrymore, who was released just before Christmas from an alcohol 
abuse rehabilitation center, says: "I wanted to be just like them so badly for 
so long. They were all famous people of the theater and they were respected and 
they were talented and, you know, they drank. Little did I know that it was 
cool not to do it. . . . It became like a fashion and that's what I wanted to 
be part of." The star of "E.T." says she started drinking at age 8, when she 
downed a glass of champagne on a dare, then started using drugs at 11. "It was 
easy to sneak out to night clubs and drink with friends. I really was a party 
girl." Her advice to children tempted by drugs and alcohol: "Listen to other 
people because I didn't and those people, a lot of those people, were right. No 
matter how many times people would tell me or my friends, I did not want to 
believe it until I had hit bottom, which I did." Barrymore claims her mother 
didn't notice her alcohol problems partly because she used her acting talents 
to hide it, and because her mother "didn't want to believe that I was doing it, 
either." ALEENE MacMINN

"Starlight Express," the Broadway musical fairy tale that's performed 
completely on roller skates, is scheduled to end its New York run with Sunday's 
matinee. The Andrew Lloyd Webber show -- about the Little Engine That Could -- 
opened March 15, 1987, and will have chugged through 761 regular performances 
and 22 previews by the time Sunday's curtain comes down. It's been playing to 
50% capacity, according to Weekly Variety's legitimate theater chart. ALEENE

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: VICTOR HUGO'S REDUX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In her books about her early life, M.F.K. Fisher talks about her parents 
dressing up and going out to The Victor Hugo to eat. It was obviously a big and 
very grown-up restaurant. It was, in fact, a downtown landmark until it moved 
to Beverly Hills in 1934 and ultimately closed. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Max au Triangle opened on the site of the old Victor Hugo. 
That, unfortunately, closed, too. Now there's a new restaurant on the same 
site. It's called . . . Victor Hugo's, and it's at 235 N. Beverly Drive, (213) 
858-7292. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine that this contemporary room, done in white and dominated 
by a huge glassed-in kitchen, has much in common with an old-line Los Angeles 
restaurant. In fact, with its sleek and comfortable chairs, its lack of windows 
and its zinc-topped bar, this looks like a restaurant that belongs in modern 
mid-town Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing old-fashioned about the menu, either. You have here a trendy 
selection of appetizers such as mussels stuffed with goat cheese in a roasted 
pepper vinaigrette, grilled Japanese eggplant in a coulis of yellow tomatoes 
with mozzarella (the mozzarella was missing when I tasted the dish), salads, 
pastas and entrees such as grilled Norwegian salmon. 
</P>
<P>
While this Victor Hugo's may not resemble the old one, it is, in its own way, a 
big and very grown-up restaurant. RUTH REICHL

YAROSLAVSKY WON'T OPPOSE BRADLEY FOR MAYOR'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that stunned friends and political supporters, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky has decided not to oppose Tom Bradley in this year's 
mayoral election, sources close to the councilman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The decision clears the way for the 71-year-old Bradley to run for an 
unprecedented fifth term without any known serious opposition at a point three 
months before the primary election. No other major candidate has appeared in 
opposition to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who spent Thursday calling a close circle of friends, would not 
"confirm or deny anything," a campaign spokeswoman said. He has scheduled a 
City Hall press conference for this morning to announce his decision. 
</P>
<P>
But sources told The Times that the Westside councilman had concluded within 
the last week that "he can't win," after a poll commissioned by Yaroslavsky 
showed voters overwhelmingly favoring Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"He spent a year and a half trying to make something here," said a former top 
Yaroslavsky aide. "In the last few weeks evaluating what you have or don't 
have, he's come to the conclusion that he doesn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky, who turned 40 last month, intends to run again for his 5th 
District City Council seat, the sources said. He ran unopposed in 1985 and 1981 
and won convincingly in 1977 in his Westside district. He was first elected in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
The decision surprised Yaroslavsky's political supporters and his allies on the 
City Council because he had led them to believe over the last several months 
that he would challenge Bradley. John Barbieri, a Yaroslavsky supporter and 
former president of the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, said last month that 
Yaroslavsky told him that he would declare his candidacy for mayor in early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Si Frumkin, one of Yaroslavsky's closest friends, said, "I'm very surprised and 
saddened because I felt he was determined to run, and I felt he had a very good 
chance to make it. He worked very hard. . . . I think he would be a hell of a 
good mayor." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Michael Woo also was startled when told that Yaroslavsky had decided 
to drop out. "He's been maintaining a steadfast position that it's up or out 
for him and he intends to go ahead," Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
For the last year, Yaroslavsky had been positioning himself to run for mayor by 
hiring a full-time campaign staff, raising more than $1 million in political 
contributions and attacking Bradley for growing stale and sluggish in dealing 
with gang violence, traffic and environmental problems. Yaroslavsky also 
assembled a campaign steering committee that included several former Bradley 
supporters and major figures in the entertainment industry, including Ed 
Sanders, a prominent Los Angeles attorney; Barry Diller, chairman of 20th 
Century Fox, and Walter Mirisch, former president of the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suffers a Setback 
</P>
<P>
But Yaroslavsky suffered a serious setback in August when two controversial 
memos that were used to help formulate his campaign strategy were leaked to The 
Times. The memos, which were written by political consultants Michael Berman 
and Carl D'Agostino and kept in Yaroslavsky's City Hall office, mocked 
Bradley's intelligence and implored the councilman to focus his fund-raising 
efforts exclusively on "wealthy" Jews who live on the city's Westside. 
</P>
<P>
With Yaroslavsky out of the race, the concern among several community leaders 
that a confrontation would develop between blacks and Jews in the coming 
election seems moot. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the memos were released, Yaroslavsky said they contained 
"offensive, contemptuous and insulting" language and vowed not to hire close 
friends Berman and D'Agostino to run his mayoral campaign. But after BAD, the 
Berman-D'Agostino firm, successfully ran the anti-oil drilling initiative 
campaign in November, Yaroslavsky began hinting in recent weeks that he might 
again hire the firm. 
</P>
<P>
This admission hurt Yaroslavsky politically at a time when he had not yet 
recovered from the Berman-D'Agostino memo debacle, said one City Council ally 
who asked not to be identified. Nevertheless, Yaroslavsky indicated that he was 
"extremely determined to make this race and to make it as formidable as 
possible" in discussions with a number of friends, the council source said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began to Fall Apart 
</P>
<P>
The council ally said that the Yaroslavsky campaign for mayor also began to 
fall apart in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been hearing a lot of rumors about morale not being good in his campaign 
office," the ally said. "There was a problem with disorganization. There was a 
perception that the campaign doesn't seem well organized at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Marvin Braude, who co-sponsored the anti-drilling measure, refused 
to speculate on Yaroslavsky's intentions but indicated that he felt that his 
colleague would have faced an extremely tough fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bradley always had strengths and I think a lot of other people thought 
that Bradley, except for one or two matters, has been a very fine mayor," 
Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
But Yaroslavsky still believed that he could defeat Bradley until last week, 
following the results of a poll on various issues affecting the city, said a 
source close to the Yaroslavsky campaign. The poll, conducted citywide several 
weeks ago, focused on Bradley's popularity and how he may be perceived as 
vulnerable on issues such as the environment, growth management and crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bradley's Popularity 
</P>
<P>
To Yaroslavsky's surprise, the poll showed that Bradley's personal popularity 
transcended all issues, the source said. Yaroslavsky determined that the mayor 
was so well liked that any effort to attack him on the issues would backfire. 
This was the only poll that Yaroslavsky had taken in preparation of his mayoral 
race. He had it commissioned to determine what sort of message he could present 
to the voters in the spring campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The source said that although Yaroslavsky told close friends of his decision 
during the last week, he waited until today to make a public announcement 
because he was still reassessing his chances and the poll data. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky also was confronted with the reality that he would give up his 
$58,592-a-year council salary if he ran for mayor. His wife, Barbara 
Yaroslavsky, expressed concern during an interview last month that her family 
might have trouble paying bills if her husband lost the mayoral election. 
</P>
<P>
So Yaroslavsky, who for the last decade has made no secret of his hopes to run 
for mayor, decided to wait at least another four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Zev was very subdued," said one friend who was notified. "It was a 
gut-wrenching decision for him." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Reassessing Position 
</P>
<P>
One prospective candidate who had hoped to succeed Yaroslavsky on the City 
Council was Laura Lake, a slow-growth advocate who has been at odds with 
Yaroslavsky on some development issues. She said that if Yaroslavsky indeed 
decides to seek reelection, "I'd have to reassess things." 
</P>
<P>
Another possible council candidate, Lisa Specht, could not be reached for 
comment, but it is considered unlikely that she would run against Yaroslavsky.

RACE FOR MAYOR: YAROSLAVSKY'S DECISION; 
</P>
<P>
THE MAN WHO REVIVED BRADLEY'S POLITICAL PULSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Within the mayoral suite on the third floor of Los Angeles City Hall, the 
center of activity Thursday -- as on most days -- was down the hall from the 
solemn, wood-paneled office where Mayor Tom Bradley conducts business. 
</P>
<P>
It's the cluttered, paper-strewn lair of Deputy Mayor Michael Gage, where aides 
gather when there is some news to chew over, often with shades drawn against 
the view of City Hall's south park. At one point Thursday afternoon, almost a 
dozen people crammed into Gage's dark cubbyhole, raising such a din with their 
laughter and congratulations that he could not hear the reports coming in by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
The jubilation was over City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's decision to bail out 
of the race for mayor, despite months of preparation, apparently convinced that 
Bradley is unbeatable. It was no surprise that the celebration would begin in 
Gage's sanctum, for Gage is given much of the credit for reviving Bradley's 
political fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
At 43, Gage is an oddity -- an environmentalist who smokes heavily and who 
works for a mayor who until recently was viewed with disdain by many 
environmental activists. 
</P>
<P>
But since Gage took over as chief of staff in mid-1987, Bradley has quieted the 
clamor over environmental issues, mostly by offering program after new program 
thought up by Gage and a staff of young, aggressive political aides in the 
mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Taylor, a former Yaroslavsky chief deputy in City Hall, has watched the 
revival of Bradley's stature over the last year and gives all of the credit to 
Gage. 
</P>
<P>
"He deserves tremendous . . . credit for bringing back a candidate who had 
basically self-destructed the last couple of years," Taylor said. "He turned 
the old Tom Bradley into a new Tom Bradley." 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Gage appeared to guide the mayor successfully through two 
skirmishes with his chief rival, victories that apparently played a role in 
Yaroslavsky's decision to bail out. 
</P>
<P>
In one, Gage minimized the damage dealt to Bradley by revelations that a 
mayoral appointee to the city Housing Authority, Alvin Greene, had missed six 
months worth of meetings. Bradley also came out better than Yaroslavsky in a 
several-day duel over plans to expand the Westside Pavilion shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the credit goes to Gage," said Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica). "He lives for the taste of battle. He breathes aggressiveness into 
City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
"I think Bradley has become more formidable in the last year because of the 
aggressive approach in City Hall on issues he was acquiescent on before," 
Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
Gage took an odd route to Bradley's office. A native of Northern California, he 
served four years as a state assemblyman from Napa, building a reputation as an 
environmentalist who enjoyed white-water rafting more than the nuances of 
legislation. But he also liked hardball politics, and Gage spent much of his 
final year as a lawmaker running the unsuccessful 1980 presidential campaign of 
then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Once out of office he signed on as a river guide with Sobek Expeditions, 
running some of the world's hairier white-water streams. Friends call him The 
Birdman -- he says because of a bird-call he has been able to make since his 
youth -- and remember him as a courageous and muscular river rat. 
</P>
<P>
He came back into politics to run campaigns for Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who 
was Speaker of the Assembly while Gage was in office. Bradley hired him after 
losing the 1986 campaign for governor, and Gage took over an office that was 
going dormant. 
</P>
<P>
"We were working in a fashion to solve the problems of the city," Gage said 
cautiously Thursday. "If that preempted Mr. Yaroslavsky, we're not unhappy with 
it."

Gear is no high-tone pedigreed dog, but right now he's worth about a thousand 
bucks. 
</P>
<P>
That's the sum of the fines -- two $500 tickets -- slapped on the guys who went 
to his rescue when the small black poodle-mix got in over his head Wednesday in 
a flood control channel in Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
Gear, who belongs to a secretary at Keril Manufacturing, sometimes scampers 
into the wash that runs near the firm. "He's a goofy little dog," says company 
co-owner Jeff Kirst. This time, employees Pete Merez and Robert Leyva took off 
down an access road in a pickup truck to retrieve Gear. 
</P>
<P>
The water had already reached the floorboards when they hauled the soggy dog 
into the truck's cab, and as they tried to turn around, the engine died. 
</P>
<P>
An employee on the bank saw what was happening and called for help. The two men 
and the dog "got out of the cab, jumped to the (truck) bed and waited for 
help," said Kirst. County fire crews lowered a ladder and rescued the soggy 
threesome -- Leyva, Merez and Gear. 
</P>
<P>
Each man faces a fine for trespassing. The dog faces a scolding. If it happens 
again, says Kirst, in a voice that sounds like he really doesn't mean it, Gear 
floats all the way to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
In hoc signo vinces. In English: the neon piggies will stay put. 
</P>
<P>
For 40 years, the sign has hung above the door to Gus's Bar-B-Q on Fair Oaks 
Avenue, a flickering marquee the precise color of nicely browned back ribs, and 
as sure a signpost of South Pasadena as the sign at the city limits. "Everyone 
grew up knowing Gus's barbecue," says City Manager John Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
Of late, South Pas has acquired a rather glossy chic, and an ordinance about to 
take effect would outlaw about 100 signs -- including Gus's, which under the 
new regulations is too big, too high, and too animated, what with all those 
little chickens and pigs marching down the side. 
</P>
<P>
A campaign was launched: "Save Gus's Sign," the leaflets read. And in a 
town-hall gesture Wednesday night, the mayor asked for a show of hands: Who 
wanted to give Gus's sign a variance? "The majority of, in fact everyone in the 
audience, (was) in favor of the sign," said Bernardi. And so, to cheers and a 
standing ovation, the council exempted Gus's sign 5 to 0. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, you can still see the sign -- but not eat the ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Gus's place has been closed for repairs since the October, 1987, earthquake. 
"It's ironic," said Bernardi. "The tremendous amount of damage the building 
suffered, and yet the sign's still there." 
</P>
<P>
If only they were all that easy. 
</P>
<P>
An alert citizen, mindful of the rash of armored car robberies of late, 
telephoned police Thursday. They might like to know that one such vehicle was 
sitting, just sitting, at 39th and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
Police cars hustling to the spot found it, all right, says Sgt. Ron Hanson of 
the bank robbery section. And there in the back, "probably lying on the money," 
Hanson surmised wryly, police also found the driver and passenger -- eating 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Call it folderol. Call it twaddle. Call it humbug and jiggery-pokery. 
</P>
<P>
Then call the Griffith Observatory. From now until Taurus -- woops, make that 
spring -- a new multimedia planetarium show will be trying to debunk the bunkum 
of our credulous world, says program director John Mosley. 
</P>
<P>
"This is something we're always concerned about -- how people sort the sense 
from the nonsense," says Mosley, who will use polls of observatory audiences to 
show that when it comes to "astrology, the Bermuda Triangle, that sort of 
stuff, there's a lot of believers." 
</P>
<P>
It's not just 20th Century angst. Mosley cites the 1835 New York Sun and its 
circulation-building hoax stories that people had been discovered on the moon. 
Amazing what some people will believe just because it appears in a newspa -- 
say, look up there . . . isn't that a . . . a flying saucer? 
</P>
<P>
Television is not the only medium affected by the long-running "Bozo Show," 
which on Thursday celebrated the 30th anniversary of its debut on KTLA in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There are literary aspects as well. In its lower-case incarnation, the word has 
entered the dictionary: "bozo . . . n. (slang?) a fellow; man, esp. one who is 
rough, burly, uncouth etc." 
</P>
<P>
And -- to show what can happen when you add a hundred years and a vowel -- 
"Boz" was the nickname of Charles Dickens.

 DEPUTY SHERIFF SUES AGAIN OVER SEX BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sgt. Susan Lynn Perez, who won a 1980 suit against the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department for discriminating against female deputies seeking 
promotion to sergeant, sued the department again Thursday -- this time 
contending that not enough women become lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
Perez, 42, of Whittier, filed her new $10-million class-action suit in U.S. 
District Court on behalf of herself and all other female uniformed sheriff's 
officers who want to be promoted to the rank. Perez alleged that discriminatory 
examinations prevent all but a few women from reaching that level. 
</P>
<P>
Although Perez was promoted to sergeant in 1980, she pressed her initial 
lawsuit and two years ago persuaded U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi to 
agree that she should have been promoted after first taking the sergeant's test 
in 1975. He awarded her $106,000 in punitive damages as well as back pay plus 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
Takasugi subsequently ordered the Sheriff's Department not to promote any more 
deputies to sergeant until it instituted more equitable promotion procedures.

 SHELTER TO HOUSE ARMORY'S HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bell Homeless Shelter for the next three days will provide shelter to 
between 50 and 75 homeless people who lost their emergency quarters when the 
California National Guard armory in Long Beach became unavailable, officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Salvation Army Capt. David Hudson, administrator of the Bell shelter, said a 
Los Angeles County official asked him to make room for the extra people from 
Long Beach. Hudson said the 18,000-square-foot facility, a remodeled federal 
warehouse, is already providing shelter to about 230 people. But if the weather 
continues to be rainy and cold, the shelter's ranks could swell to more than 
300, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials have been informed that the National Guard plans 
to use the Long Beach armory for routine drills on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Under a state program, the armories normally are given over to the homeless 
whenever temperatures drop below 40 degrees in dry weather and 50 degrees in 
rainy weather.

 POLICE WANT TO TALK TO RUBIN ABOUT PIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police said Thursday they want to question Jewish Defense League 
leader Irv Rubin about a television videotape on which he apparently referred 
to the delivery of a pig to the home of activist Stanley Sheinbaum two days 
before it happened. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, KCBS broadcast a videotape of a Friday press conference in 
which, the station said, Rubin could be heard saying off camera, ". . . be 
delivering a huge pig to Stanley Sheinbaum's home." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, someone left a skinned, dead pig in the driveway of Sheinbaum's West 
Los Angeles home. Sheinbaum acknowledged that some Jewish groups reacted 
angrily to the Stockholm meeting that he and four other American Jews had with 
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat in an effort to help 
bring about negotiations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the tapes that we've seen and the audio we've heard, we certainly 
have to talk to Irv Rubin," Cmdr. William Booth said. He said officers are 
"viewing it as as a hatred incident," which in certain cases can be prosecuted 
as a felony. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Krugal, the local JDL chapter chairman, said the organization "has no 
knowledge of who did it, but we applaud the act highly. . . ."

OBSERVATORY ATOP MT. WILSON AIMS TO REJOIN SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After running the venerable Mt. Wilson Observatory in the mountains overlooking 
Los Angeles for 84 years, the Carnegie Institution Thursday formally handed 
over the facility that was once the world's leading center of astronomy to a 
small Pasadena institute with an ambitious dream. 
</P>
<P>
The Mount Wilson Institute, a nonprofit group headed by Arthur H. Vaughn, a 
veteran astronomer, is seeking several million dollars in private funds to 
expand research and restore the facility's 100-inch reflecting telescope to 
active service. 
</P>
<P>
In a small ceremony in Washington, Vaughn said that -- despite the dazzling 
lights of Los Angeles a mile below the observatory and the occasional high-tide 
of smog that envelops the peak -- Mt. Wilson is considered the finest site in 
the continental United States for observing the skies. 
</P>
<P>
His plan, he said, is to put the observatory and its 100-inch telescope to work 
in a neglected area of astronomy -- the study of closer, brighter stars to 
better understand the turbulent behavior of the sun and to search for other 
planetary systems. 
</P>
<P>
"It is old, no doubt. But it forms very sharp images. That is what matters," 
Vaughn noted. With modern computer processing of its images, he said, the 
telescope's performance under some conditions could equal that of the 
billion-dollar Hubble Space Telescope that the space shuttle is scheduled to 
carry into Earth orbit in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
The most promising sources of funds, Vaughn said, will be private corporations 
and possibly public subscriptions. In return, the Mount Wilson Institute 
proposes to make the observatory serve double duty as a regional astronomy 
education center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Once the World's Largest 
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Wilson Observatory was established in 1904 with money from 
industrialist Andrew Carnegie. In July, 1917, a spindly truck wheezed up a 
perilous mountain road with a 100-inch mirror made of French wine-bottle glass, 
and four months later the world's largest reflecting telescope -- a distinction 
Mt. Wilson held for 31 years -- was probing the universe. 
</P>
<P>
With this telescope in the 1920s and '30s, astronomer Edwin P. Hubble 
discovered that what appeared to be nebulous wisps of glowing gas were in fact 
other galaxies, receding at unimaginable distances and speeds at the rim of an 
expanding universe. 
</P>
<P>
Maxine F. Singer, president of the Carnegie Institution, said it was decided in 
1984 to stop funding Mt. Wilson to divert money to construction of a mammoth 
new telescope in the Andes Mountains of Chile. The Magellan telescope's mirror 
is to measure 315 inches, making it by far the world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vaughn noted, reports of the demise of science on Mt. Wilson have 
been greatly exaggerated. "The public may think it's closed, but it's really a 
beehive of activity up there." 
</P>
<P>
Five research projects based at five universities are under way, financed by 
about $300,000 in federal grants, mostly from the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
But the observatory no longer has funds for its own independent scientific 
staff. Vaughn said that he hopes to raise the operating budget to about 
$750,000 a year, but that another $1 million to $2 million will be needed to 
bring the 100-inch telescope out of mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
"Before the National Science Foundation was there, astronomers knew how to 
raise money from private sources," he said. "We're going to have to learn that 
again."

Stock Fraud." All of these stories deal with a common theme: greed. No high 
ideological principles involved here -- just get rich no matter how and to heck 
with any idea of patriotism or consideration of your fellow man. 
</P>
<P>
Charities are failing to reach their goals. Insider trading abounds and the 
plight of the homeless becomes increasingly impossible to comprehend. Congress 
is held in contempt by more and more thinking people as its members feather 
their own nests at the expense of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
This situation has been allowed to fester and grow under the current 
Administration in which liars and perjurers are considered national heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Is there going to be a change when the "kinder and gentler" Administration 
takes over?

CONFIDENCE IN GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your editorial "It's Now or Never" (Dec. 25) and several of the letters from 
readers on the same page are continuing evidence of the public's lack of 
confidence in our federal, state and local governments and the elected 
politicians in office. I certainly agree that such a lack of confidence exists 
and is growing. However, I can't fault the politicians because if they acted 
differently they probably wouldn't be in office. Our present system causes 
politicians to have as their first three priorities: 1) reelection, 2) being 
friendly to all constituents, and 3) doing what they can for the nation, after 
fulfilling the first two priorities. 
</P>
<P>
In my carefully considered opinion, substantial improvement can be made in our 
governments rather simply -- always vote against incumbents in primary as well 
as general elections. If only 25% of the voters did this I expect very 
substantial benefits to result quickly. Most elective terms would be too short 
for that system and I advocate lengthening them. Perhaps for the President and 
senators, 8-year terms with one-eighth of the senators elected each year. 
Congressmen should serve something like four years, with one-quarter being 
elected each year, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Such a change cannot be enacted into law as the opposition is much too 
powerful. But no law on re-election is needed as support of this principle by 
25% of the voters would be fully effective. After that the politicians would 
quickly extend the terms. A utopian result is not claimed, but I am quite sure 
that substantial benefits would result. 
</P>
<P>
All major problems are controversial. Politicians concerned over their 
reelection are, quite justifiably, afraid of offending groups of voters and so 
avoid essential actions.

By deciding not to seek a third term in 1990, Gov. George Deukmejian may have 
created the opportunity for achieving real progress in California during his 
final two years in Sacramento. Freed of the constraints and tensions of a 
reelection campaign, the 60-year-old Republican now is in a position to work 
effectively with the Democratic leaders in the Legislature in building a 
brighter future for the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
The governor seemed to relish that prospect as he announced to Sacramento 
correspondents on Thursday that he will retire from public life in January, 
1991, after 30 years as state legislator, attorney general and governor. "I 
like the job," he said, sounding as if he really does. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian acknowledged the obvious during his press conference: If he were 
running for a third term, majority Democrats in the Legislature's two houses 
would be out to thwart his programs. They would not do anything to enhance the 
governor's record, and thus his prospects for winning another four years as 
governor. Without the albatross of a bitter campaign, Deukmejian said that he 
intends to be an active governor who will not simply wait for the clock to run 
out on his final term. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of having a governor engaged in give-and-take with the Legislature 
would be a welcome change from recent years in Sacramento, which have been 
marked by wearisome partisan stalemates, with the governor rarely emerging from 
his office. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) already had 
announced that he will spend more time on policy issues this year and less on 
party affairs. And Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) is 
secure enough in his job to allow for some innovative negotiation of 
California's long list of problems. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian had been under intense pressure from influential Republicans to seek 
reelection, but he said that he was not interested in setting records for 
longevity in office. Rather, the governor said that he seeks more 
accomplishments in office in his remaining two years, and the best way to do 
that is by not running for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
What might have been two years of bitter discontent and lack of achievement in 
Sacramento suddenly has become a two-year window of opportunity for the leaders 
of California. They must not let it slip shut.

The stupidity of some federal agencies never ceases to amaze me ("UC Lecturer 
Cleared of Bomb Threat on Jet," Part I, Dec. 30). So the FBI has finally 
discovered that Peter Canning actually is who he says he is and was, incredible 
as it may have seemed to the authorities, telling the truth. 
</P>
<P>
This man deserves a written apology from all concerned. The sad corollary to 
all of this is that who among us, having read what happened to Canning, would 
have the conviction to act in a similar potentially dangerous situation while 
on board an aircraft?

INSIDERS ON THE LOOSE;

<P>
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT ALL THE GOVERNMENT'S CONSULTANTS ARE DOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PRYOR, David Pryor (D-Ark.) is the chairman of the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee's federal services subcommittee.

<TEXT>
<P>
When the Justice Department announced Operation Ill Wind last June, it was as 
if a hurricane had suddenly struck the entire defense-procurement system. 
</P>
<P>
The revelations concerning potential criminal behavior on the part of some 
well-connected defense consultants brought the usually behind-the-scenes world 
of consulting out into the open. Just as the eye of a hurricane provides a 
brief respite, the secrecy of the grand-jury process has thrown a calmness over 
the events of the scandal over procurement. It is appropriate then, in this 
time of relative calm, to take a systematic look at the role that consultants 
play in our government. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, when President Jimmy Carter asked for a short list of all 
consultants who were working for the federal government, we have been aware of 
an abysmal lack of information on the government's use of such people. We do 
not know the answers to such basic questions as how many consultants work for 
the government, how much we pay them (estimates have ranged from $243 million a 
year to $26 billion a year), what work they are doing, or whether anyone has 
checked to see if federal workers could have done the job. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, increasingly, the basic work of government has been delegated to a work 
force that is nowhere to be found on the official organization charts -- a 
shadow government. 
</P>
<P>
It is not my contention that this shadow government is totally corrupt. It is 
my contention that Congress, the press and the public should have easy access 
to the "real organizational charts" of our federal agencies. Only when we have 
information on the numbers of consultants and the actual work that they are 
performing can we then have a true picture of our government. 
</P>
<P>
We found in the past that the Department of Energy employed a contractor to 
help plan our nation's response to future oil shortages. This same contractor 
also worked for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. A federal 
worker would not be allowed to maintain this potential conflict of interest. 
But in the shadow of government the agencies often don't know what 
private-sector (or in this case what international) interests the consultants 
or contractors have. 
</P>
<P>
At the Department of Defense, we recently found that a consulting organization 
had largely written the department's directive that established the Pentagon's 
policy on consultants. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 the Department of Defense testified that it had 31,000 contractors 
performing consulting services, studies, management and professional services. 
The government did not know in 1981, and the government still does not fully 
know in 1989, what potential conflicts of interests exist between the work that 
these individuals do for the government and the work that they do for the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
In the defense-procurement scandal we have seen that private contractors 
themselves have the resources and the incentive to hire their own private 
consultants. The actual work performed by these private-sector consultants and 
their relationship to the government is shrouded in the same shadow as the 
government's own consultants and contractors. 
</P>
<P>
It is all too difficult to find the most basic data on the government's private 
work force. But at least when a consultant is hired by the government some 
record should exist. This new level in the private bureaucracy, where 
consultants hire consultants, defies even the most basic opportunity for 
scrutiny. Though tax dollars might (it is hard to say with certainty) be paying 
these consultants to consultants, neither Congress nor the public can find out 
what these people are actually doing. 
</P>
<P>
We are becoming a nation of insiders and outsiders, not public officials and 
citizens. On the one hand, the public is unaware of the decisions and actions 
made by this unelected bureaucracy. On the other hand, those who happen to be 
plugged into this shadow government have privileged access to government 
information. When unscrupulous individuals trade on this government information 
and are caught, we have a scandal. I deplore this alleged example of 
profiteering off one's privileged access to information. Until we have total 
disclosure, however, we simply don't know the extent of the procurement 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
We need our own glasnost in this area. Unless we have comprehensive disclosure 
of the private-sector connections of persons hired as government consultants or 
contractors, then neither Congress, the citizens nor indeed the majority of the 
federal work force can have complete trust that we are receiving unbiased and 
untainted advice. Furthermore, as far as defense contracting is concerned, only 
through disclosure will we know if major procurement decisions (that is, weapon 
systems) are being made based on reasons of national security and not based on 
who had the best inside information. While the disclosure of who is doing what 
for the federal government and who his private-sector clients are will not 
solve all the defense-procurement problems, this openness will go a long way 
toward restoring confidence in our system. 
</P>
<P>
I am somewhat encouraged by the Pentagon's recent announcement that it no 
longer opposes the registration of consultants. With the Defense Department's 
support, perhaps the congressionally mandated requirement for the 
Administration to formulate a consultant registration proposal will result in 
some meaningful procurement reform. Unfortunately, the legislation gives the 
incoming Bush Administration the option of deciding whether or not to actually 
use the registration proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Yet when the grand-jury indictments start the Operation Ill Wind hurricane 
blowing again, I hope that the new Administration will seize the concept of 
consultant registration as a way of restoring taxpayer confidence in a troubled 
system.

VIVID GREEN IS COLOR OF MONEY

<P>
His last name is Green, his favorite color is blue, and he thinks the 
importance attached to golf's four major championships is a "figment of the 
media's imagination, Jack Nicklaus' imagination and a few other golfers." 
</P>
<P>
His first name is not Hubert. It's Ken. But he is not a doll. Although he does 
get wound up. Last year he broke five clubs. On the course. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Green is not a clone either. Or anything else you might expect off the 
PGA's sanitized conveyor belt, which for years has threatened to turn 
professional golf into Blondes-R-Us. 
</P>
<P>
He wears his glasses thick, his dark hair short, his baggy pants pleated and 
his heart on his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
He speaks his mind when asked. And he speaks his mind when not asked. 
</P>
<P>
He is 30 and the winner of more than a million dollars worldwide in 1988, a 
year in which he finished first in eagles, fifth in putting, 11th in scoring 
and fourth on the PGA money list. 
</P>
<P>
He is part Tommy Bolt, part Mac O'Grady and part Thomas Paine, the early 
American moralist and author of Common Sense who once said, "Character is much 
easier kept than recovered." 
</P>
<P>
But mostly Green is himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Green," says Paul Azinger, the PGA's Player of the Year in 1987, "is Ken 
Green. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys are one way in a practice round and another way on camera. Ken 
Green is the same way. And he doesn't care what anybody thinks." 
</P>
<P>
He is arguably the hottest golfer in the world, Curtis Strange notwithstanding, 
although a touch of flu and a 2-week layoff cooled him off Thursday in the 
first round of the MONY Tournament of Champions at La Costa, where he shot 77. 
</P>
<P>
Green is never far in spirit from his Danbury, Conn., home. His regular caddie, 
Joe LaCava, from nearby Newtown, is his cousin. Before that, his caddie for 2 
1/2 years was his sister, Shelly, who used to say you could tell her apart from 
the other bag-toters because of the "blue eye-liner." 
</P>
<P>
Green's initial reaction to Augusta National, golf's Sistine Chapel, was as 
unpredictable as his temper. 
</P>
<P>
After firing a first-round 68 to share the early lead at the 1986 Masters, he 
said: "I am not impressed with Magnolia Lane." 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, was first-degree blasphemy. It is now almost 3 years later, 
but he refuses to back off. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot more drives in Connecticut that are a helluva lot more 
prettier than Magnolia Lane was," he said Wednesday. "That's my honest opinion. 
I will tell you my honest opinion. I get a lot of abuse sometimes for the 
things I say. But that's the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that if somebody watches me for 18 holes, they're going to talk 
about that when they go home. Some people are going to enjoy what I do, they're 
going to enjoy the golf, they're going to enjoy my comments, they're going to 
enjoy me flipping the ball around or the club around. Other people are going to 
hate it, and they're going to go home and tell all their friends what a 
terrible young man I am." 
</P>
<P>
Early this week at La Costa, they threw a press conference for Arnold Palmer, a 
man the other players still refer to as "The King." Palmer benignly held court 
on subjects ranging from "putting," "course conditions" and "confidence" to the 
recent dominance over Americans by the Europeans in Ryder Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans," Palmer said, "have worked a little harder." 
</P>
<P>
Green, one of the hardest-working American golfers, rankled. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a crock," he said of Palmer's assertion. "The thing going on 
right now about the Europeans knowing how to win or working harder or wanting 
to win versus Americans is such a crock. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I never knew you could compare players on the basis of alternate 
shot or best ball (the Ryder format). I don't believe that's how you determine 
who the best players in the world are. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this is Arnold's way or Jack's way to give us (the Americans) a little 
push to play better. But it's a crock." 
</P>
<P>
So, too, says Green, is the criticism leveled at the U.S. tour for its failure 
to produce a dominant player. Strange, he points out, has won the money title 3 
of the last 4 years. 
</P>
<P>
"What do they expect?" Green asks. "Four out of four? Jack never did that. What 
Curtis has done should shut everybody up. But it hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Let's quickly review the bidding here: Magnolia Lane is unimpressive. Arnold 
Palmer's proclamations on European golfers are a crock. Female caddies are all 
right. Breaking clubs is honest emotion. And the majors are a figment of Jack 
Nicklaus' imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a world right now where, as golfers go, supposedly there's no one out 
there that has a personality or any color," Green says. "Then, if you find 
someone that's a little radical, he gets criticized for being radical. It's a 
no-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rest of the golf world eyes Green warily. The feeling is mutual. 
He is perched on the precipice of their establishment, and he isn't sure 
whether the next step is up or down. 
</P>
<P>
"We're incredibly spoiled," he says of professional golfers, too many of whom 
get bent out of shape when the courtesy car and keys aren't waiting at the 
airport each week. 
</P>
<P>
Green rented his car this week. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to give the courtesy cars to the guys who just came out of the 
qualifying school," he says. "Those are the guys who need to save 200 bucks." 
</P>
<P>
Is Ken Green good for golf? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Azinger says. "I wouldn't say, 'Hey, he's definitely good for 
golf.' I wouldn't say he's terrible for golf either." 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, the golfing establishment hasn't quite figured out what to make of Ken 
Green. He is consistent in his ability to defy prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"Ken Green is as unpredictable as the weather," Azinger says. 
</P>
<P>
But, Azinger adds, Green is immensely talented. Long enough off the tee to rank 
27th among the tour's drivers. Delicate enough around the greens to have 
finished 13th in sand saves and second last year in the overall category that 
combines all the tour's statistical departments. 
</P>
<P>
And confident enough now to finish first regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"He could win seven tournaments out here this year," Azinger says 
matter-of-factly. 
</P>
<P>
It's even fun to watch Green practice. On the chipping green, he will wedge a 
handful of balls near the cup. Then, without picking them up, he will feather 
the balls back into the rough 10 yards away, taking a full swing that touches 
nothing but the ball, which arcs softly before plopping back into the long 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
Azinger remembers the days when he used to play practice rounds with Green and 
Green's good friend, Mark Calcavecchia. Before teeing off, Calcavecchia and 
Green would stand around dreaming up wild wagers. Like placing a ball on top of 
a stake 3 feet off the ground and laying 7-1 odds on $10 they could chip it 
into a bucket 40 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
"Innovative," Azinger said. "They've got imaginations. They didn't always wedge 
it into the bucket. But that's just the way they were, always making crazy 
bets. But paying up when they lost." 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing he (Green) does surprises me," LaCava says. "But he's great to caddie 
for. I'd caddie for him over anybody." 
</P>
<P>
CBS-TV golf announcer Gary McCord nicknamed Green "Flipper" when Green started 
nonchalantly tossing his putter to LaCava after making putts. The two have 
perfected their act to the point where Green doesn't even look for LaCava 
anymore before flipping the putter behind his back or over his shoulder. LaCava 
says he hasn't dropped one yet during a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Good hands people," Green says. 
</P>
<P>
Green won his first 1988 tournament last September, the Canadian Open. The 
following week in Milwaukee, he shot a 61 on Saturday, equaling the lowest 
round on tour all year, and eventually won by six strokes. This despite chest 
pains and dizziness on Sunday that almost forced him to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
"On about the sixth hole, he turned to me and said, 'I don't know if I'm going 
to be able to finish this thing,' " LaCava said. "I told him, 'You'd better.' " 
</P>
<P>
Green did. A cardiologist later diagnosed the problem as a pinched nerve or 
muscle spasms. 
</P>
<P>
So Green continued playing. Two weeks after Milwaukee, he finished sixth at the 
B.C. Open. Then second at Pensacola. Then 12th at the Walt Disney. Then fourth 
at Tucson. Then third at Nabisco. 
</P>
<P>
Four times in 1988, Green earned 6-figure paychecks. Then he jetted to Japan, 
where he won another $221,000 by finishing first in something called the Dunlop 
Phoenix. His U.S. tour earnings in 1988 were $779,180. The victory in Japan 
pushed him over the million-dollar mark, an accomplishment obscured when 
Strange became the first player to make more than a million in one year on the 
U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an incredible stretch," Green says. "Yet I think I should have won six 
tournaments instead of three." 
</P>
<P>
All this from a golfer who failed twice to get his players card and had to 
enroll in the PGA's qualifying school three more times before graduating for 
good in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Green finished 156th on the money list with earnings of $20,160. To 
put that in perspective, LaCava made almost three times that much carrying 
Green's bag in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"1984 was probably my nightmare," Green says. "I got to know Freddie (Nightmare 
on Elm Street) Krueger in 1984. It was scary. Everything was a disaster. My 
personal life was splitso. My golf was psycho. It was just a combination of 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
Golf, his first love, was no longer fun. But he decided he would give it one 
more shot. 
</P>
<P>
"Panics, in some cases, have their uses," Thomas Paine once wrote. "They 
produce as much good as hurt. Their duration is always short; the mind soon 
grows through them and acquires a firmer habit than before." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 Green bounced back to win $151,355 and the first of his four PGA Tour 
titles, the Buick Open. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he found Ellen Targett, a woman with common sense and the one who 
would soon become his second wife. They had known each other in high school, 
but hadn't connected then. 
</P>
<P>
"She gets a ton of credit from me," Green says. "If you want to have a good 
life on tour, you've got to have a good wife. It was like in the movies when 
you fall so much in love with somebody that it makes such a difference. It's 
like Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour all over. But it's real." 
</P>
<P>
So are the dollars they're paying him to play a sport that most others pay 
their own money to play when they aren't working. He is Green without envy. 
</P>
<P>
"People forget how lucky we are, other golfers forget how lucky we are," Green 
says. "It can be difficult out here. And you can bitch and moan. But a day 
doesn't go by out here where I don't think I'm a lucky person."

This was a victory that Jim Brandenburg said he felt in his gut and his heart. 
</P>
<P>
His San Diego State basketball team defeated Colorado State, 62-57, in front of 
3,924 at the San Diego Sports Arena Thursday night, in a special game for the 
Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
The game had significance because it meant that for the first time in 3 
seasons, the Aztecs opened Western Athletic Conference play with a victory. And 
to do so, they had to beat the coaches' preseason choice to win the title, a 
team that had won the past five meetings between the schools, two last season 
by a combined 41 points. 
</P>
<P>
That is where the guts came into play. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time this year, I felt we had something down inside that was not 
going to let us be unsuccessful," Brandenburg said. "I mean there was something 
down inside us that we were going to stay after it and find ways to prevail. It 
is that type of thing that will gel our basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the excitement of the moment, the game had deeper meaning for 
Brandenburg. This was a matchup of friends: Brandenburg against Colorado State 
Coach Boyd Grant, his roommate when the two played at the school in the mid 
1950s. And for the first time in four major-college tries, Brandenburg defeated 
his good friend. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a time to gloat. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to know the truth, we love each other," Brandenburg said. "The 
kind of affection we both have for each other will transcend this game and many 
more." 
</P>
<P>
The feeling, after more than 30 years, remains mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"I hugged him at the half, and I said let it be tied at the end so we can go 
another 5 (minutes)," Grant said, "but he didn't seem to take my advice. 
</P>
<P>
"He has got to feel good. His team deserved to win. I enjoyed that part for him 
because I know he wanted to win, and it was a big win for him, too." 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs (7-4, 1-0 in WAC) started as if they were going to make quick work 
of the Rams (7-5, 0-1), dominating inside and on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
Senior center Mitch McMullen scored the first five of his team-high 17 points 
as SDSU took a 17-7 lead with 14:42 to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
But then the Aztecs got sloppy. They went on a 6:45 scoreless streak in which 
they made six turnovers and missed their only two shots. 
</P>
<P>
"We jumped out early on them; then we stopped running our offense," Brandenburg 
said. "We stood around, and they just stood and matched up with us. We were not 
productive offensively, and they warmed up with us." 
</P>
<P>
That allowed Colorado State to go on a 9-0 run to draw within 17-16 at 8:10. 
Pat Durham, the senior all-WAC forward who had been held scoreless through the 
first 11 minutes, scored the last five of those nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Durham would recover from his slow start to finish with a game-high 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
"You slow (Durham) down, you don't stop him," Brandenburg said. "He is quick, 
strong, puts the ball on the floor and is a great rebounder." 
</P>
<P>
McMullen finally ended the scoreless streak with a 3-point play off a dunk to 
give the Aztecs a 20-16 lead with 7:57 left in the half. But by now, the Aztecs 
knew they were in for a game. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State drew within one twice before finally taking its first lead on 
Durham's tip-in at 1:23. 
</P>
<P>
Junior center Eric Friehauf stretched the Colorado State lead to 31-28 on a 
lay-in with 49 seconds left before SDSU guard Michael Best made a 21-foot 
3-pointer 15 seconds later to tie the game at 31-31 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The tone had been set for a contentious second half. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed nine times, and there were two ties in the first 11:12. No 
team could take more than a 3-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
That finally changed when the Aztecs went on a 6-point run to take a 50-45 lead 
with 7:29 to play and never looked back. The first two of the baskets came on 
fast-break passes from guard Bryan Williams, who finished with a game-high 9 
assists (giving him 28 in the past three games). 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs stretched their advantage to 61-51 with 58 seconds left before the 
Rams scored six of the last seven points to make the final score close. It was 
quite a difference from the two easy victories the Rams scored last year 
against SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
"They are more physical and can bring it on the break better," Grant said. "We 
wouldn't want to play San Diego State even if it was in the zoo." 
</P>
<P>
The importance of the victory could be seen in Brandenburg's lack of 
substitutions. Four of the starters played at least 35 minutes, and the 
starters accounted for 177 of the 200 available playing minutes.

PADRES MAY PUT MONDAY IN THE BOOTH

The Padres winter-long search for a No. 2 broadcaster might have an ending as 
surprising as Dave Campbell's firing. 
</P>
<P>
Indications are that the Padres are close to signing Rick Monday, the former 
major league outfielder whose most recent broadcast work has been as a Dodger 
commentator on cable television and a sports anchor for Los Angeles' KTTV (Ch. 
11). 
</P>
<P>
Monday said he met with Padre officials Wednesday in San Diego and that his 
agent, Richard Lawrence, was involved in contract discussions with the Padres 
on Thursday. Monday said Thursday there was a "strong possibility" for 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got this fishing boat in Marina del Rey, and there's a strong possibility 
I'm going to be looking for dock space down south," Monday said from his home 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if a hiring were imminent, Jim Winters, the Padre broadcasting 
director, said, "No comment." Lawrence said he would not respond to any 
questions until today. 
</P>
<P>
The latest developments coincide with the ending of negotiations with Chicago 
Cub announcer Dewayne Staats, the third of three original finalists that could 
not reach agreement with the Padres. Gary Thorne, who joined the Chicago White 
Sox, and Gary Cohen, who joined the New York Mets, were the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Money had a lot to do with it," said Staats, who was asking for a No. 1 
announcer's salary of around $200,000 because of the Padres' expressed desire 
to groom the new hire to eventually replace the current No. 1, Jerry Coleman. 
The Padres were offering only around $120,000, the current rate for a No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
A source said the breakup with Staats convinced the Padres to stop pursuing a 
potential No. 1 and instead hire an analyst. The source said the Padres have 
decided not to worryabout Coleman's replacement until closer to the 1991 season 
and the end of his 3-year contract. One of the reasons given for firing Dave 
Campbell in October, after 11 seasons as Coleman's backup, was that he would 
not have been a suitable replacement. 
</P>
<P>
"They have readjusted their thinking," the source said. "They want to hire an 
analyst, probably an ex-player, and worry about replacing Jerry in a couple of 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Monday. Known for a smooth voice and competent delivery that inspires 
neither high praise nor great criticism, Monday would be a considered a safe 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing his 19-year major league career with the Dodgers in 1984 -- a 
career that included three World Series appearances and two All-Star games -- 
Monday joined the Dodgers' cable television team as a play-by-play and color 
man, doing about 20 games a year. He also worked the pregame show for road 
games broadcast on KTTV and acted as the station's sports anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Following the 1987 season, he was deemed good enough to be considered as a 
replacement for retiring Jerry Doggett on the Dodger radio network. Don 
Drysdale eventually got the job. Monday currently is out of broadcasting; his 
cable contract has expired and a new one is being negotiated. He also recently 
left KTTV in a contract dispute over the station's demand that he work 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
He said from where he sits, San Diego would be an ideal spot. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a great job, in a good city, with a good team," Monday said. 
"The Padres remind me a little of the old A's (Oakland, where Monday played 
from 1969-71). They've got great young talent sprinkled with veterans, they are 
a team that is catching the eyes of everyone. It would be fun to be a part of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Monday grew up in Santa Monica, it should be no surprise which 
broadcaster he emulates. 
</P>
<P>
"There's only one Vin Scully," said Monday, who said he approaches a game the 
way he would approaches a book -- "Every game has a beginning, a middle and an 
end, and every game as a story to tell." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Padres announced entire 1988 schedule Thursday. If they are to be pennant 
contenders, they are in for an interesting finish. While they play West 
Division rival Cincinnati just three times in the first 2 months, and don't 
even see the Dodgers until June 19, they end the season with 9 of their final 
12 games against those teams. . . . The season opens Monday April 3 at San 
Diego Jack Murphy Stadium against San Francisco. The last time the Padres 
opened at home, in 1984, they won the pennant . . . Padre Manager Jack McKeon 
said he has talked trade this week with the usual two teams -- Atlanta 
(outfielder Dale Murphy) and New York Yankees (third baseman Mike Pagliarulo) 
-- but there is still nothing imminent. . . . The Padres have the distinction 
of having baseball's first arbitration filing -- shortstop Dickie Thon, who 
filed Thursday even though he has already demanded a trade and must be 
accommodated by March 15 or become a free agent. "We're just doing this a 
precaution," said Thon's agent, Dan Grigsby. "Hopefully, there will be a trade 
worked out before we actually have to go to a hearing." Thon made $300,000 
counting incentives last year and responded with a .264 average and 1 homer and 
18 RBIs in part-time play. Although the Padres have six players eligible for 
arbitration, they will will likely only have one come even close to a hearing: 
pitcher Dennis Rasmussen, who made $475,000 and went 14-4 for the Padres after 
coming over from Cincinnati June 8. He could be seeking close to the $1 million 
currently topped by the Padres other top starters, Bruce Hurst and Eric Show.

Gary Payton scored 19 points, handed out 10 assists and had 4 steals Thursday 
night to lead Oregon State to a 64-55 Pacific 10 basketball victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
The Beavers, 1-2 in the Pac-10 and 8-3 overall, took the lead for good late in 
the first half and held off a second-half USC rally to beat the Trojans for the 
25th time in their last 29 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
USC, 0-2 in the conference and 7-6 for the season, used a trio of 3-pointers by 
Anthony Pendleton to build a 19-12 lead midway through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
But Oregon State, which won its fourth in a row, outscored the visitors 23-9 
the rest of the half to take a 35-28 lead at intermission. Payton had three 
assists, a 3-pointer and a 2-pointer to account for the first 12 points of the 
decisive outburst. 
</P>
<P>
USC rallied within 40-36 on Ronnie Coleman's rebound basket with 15 minutes to 
play. But after both teams went scoreless for more than three minutes, Eric 
Knox hit a 3-pointer to boost the Oregon State lead to 43-36 with 11:51 to 
play. The Trojans never threatened seriously again. 
</P>
<P>
USC had a 37-22 rebound advantage but committed 19 turnovers against the 
Beavers' pressure defense. Oregon State committed 10 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton led the Trojans in scoring with 17 points. Coleman added 15 points 
and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Will Brantley scored 17 points and Knox 15 for the Beavers.

WARRIOR CAGERS COLLIDE WITH PASADENA, TOUGHEST SCC OPPONENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The El Camino College men's basketball team will travel to Pasadena City 
College on Saturday to open South Coast Conference play at 7:30 p.m. The 
Warriors are 15-5 after Wednesday's 84-81 victory over Fashion Institute. 
Pasadena (12-4) is thought to be El Camino's toughest SCC opponent. The Lancers 
ended a 10-game winning streak when they fell to Santa Monica in their own 
tournament last month. 
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team will play its third straight road 
game at 1 p.m. Sunday at Wyoming. The Lions were 7-4 after losing at Weber 
State, 83-63, on Tuesday. Sunday's game is Loyola's last non-conference 
contest. They open West Coast Athletic Conference play Jan. 13 at San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th annual Redondo Beach Super Bowl Sunday 10-K on Jan. 22 will offer 
prize money to the athletic programs of schools that win the centipede race -- 
10 or more runners linked by costume fabric -- and the six-pack competition for 
teams of six runners. Race organizers offered team prize money for the first 
time last year and an El Camino College team won $500 for the track program. 
Team entry information is available at 376-6913.

MILLERSVILLE TO GIVE CSUN A BASKETBALL LITMUS TEST AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
National rankings in Division II basketball don't come out until the middle of 
the month, but when they do, expect Millersville University (Pa.) to be listed 
somewhere in the Top 20. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or where Northridge is ranked depends largely on the Matadors' 
performance tonight in a nonconference game against Millersville in the CSUN 
gym. 
</P>
<P>
The Marauders are 7-3, but 2 of the losses were to Alaska-Anchorage, which also 
has beaten Michigan, at one time ranked second in Division I. Millersville has 
won 6 in a row, including a 101-75 decision over Cal State Los Angeles on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge (9-2) will be without forward Alan Fraser, who sustained an ankle 
injury Wednesday in the Matadors' 92-78 victory over Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN Coach Pete Cassidy already was concerned about the Marauders' height 
advantage, and that was before he knew the Matadors would be without a 6-foot, 
6-inch starting forward. Phil Nevin, Millersville's 6-11 center, is 3 inches 
taller than Todd Bowser, Northridge's tallest player. 
</P>
<P>
Nevin, a transfer from Maryland, averages 13 points and 12 rebounds a game. He 
is not the player Cassidy is most concerned about, however. That distinction 
goes to Tommy Gaines, a 6-6 forward who is averaging 21 points and 9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"He has about a 15- to 17-foot shooting range and is a great athlete," Cassidy 
said of Gaines. "He posts up, turns around and jumps over people." 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Gathers, CSUN's top scorer with an 18.5 average, likely will draw 
Gaines when the Matadors play man-to-man defense. Gathers also is a gifted 
athlete with great leaping ability. The problem is that he's only 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Gaines is slowed -- he scored only 8 against Cal State L. A. -- 
there is guard Matt Harris to worry about. Harris scored 31 points Wednesday 
and made 10 of 15 3-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a very difficult match-up for us," Cassidy said. "I'm looking at it 
as a great test for us. They're a big, strong, quick, experienced team." 
</P>
<P>
Northridge, which has played rather inconsistently against relatively weak 
teams, has won 3 in a row and 7 of 8. In their only game against a highly 
regarded Division II opponent, the Matadors defeated Cal State Sacramento, 
100-98, in overtime on Dec. 28.

JEANINE DAVIS FITS IN FINE WITH THE BOYS ON THE OAK HILL HIGH BASKETBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIN LUE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Junior forward Mario Loffredo admits that he despised the girl who tried out 
for the Oak Hill High boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured a lot of guys on the other teams would laugh," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Loffredo also felt awkward about practicing against the girl. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hesitate to throw the ball as hard to her as to the other guys -- I 
was afraid I'd hurt her," he said. "When I had to block out I didn't want to 
touch her." 
</P>
<P>
Then Loffredo made up his mind. He planned to run the girl off the team. 
Literally. "I would try extra hard at practice to make her mess up -- so she 
would die and not make the team -- but she kept up!" 
</P>
<P>
There was even talk of freezing her out during games. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys said they would not pass her the ball if they played in a 
game with her," Loffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
Why such harsh treatment? "It's a guy's game and she's a girl -- a chick," 
Loffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
But Loffredo has changed his tune. "She's tough. I'm treating her like any 
other player." 
</P>
<P>
The object of Loffredo's change of heart is Jeanine Davis, a 15-year-old 
sophomore reserve guard, who tried out for and made the basketball team at Oak 
Hill, a small private school in Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who is 5-6 and weighs 130 pounds, laughs when asked about those first 
days at practice. "They might say, 'Don't throw it too hard; It might hit her 
chest,' " Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Phil Bruder also remembers the needling Davis endured during the 
15-minute drives to the team's off-campus practice gym. "They would say, 'You 
don't look like a jock, but here you are a jock,' or, 'I never went out with a 
teammate before.' " 
</P>
<P>
And how does the latter comment stand with Bruder? "I think there might be a 
player or two who might want to date her, but I don't have a problem with 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who confirmed that she does have admirers on the team, said she still 
gets plenty of ribbing, but she also gets her share of respect. Especially 
after scoring her first point on a technical foul shot against Southwestern. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowd was looking at me funny and then I swished one and said 'Oh, yeah!' 
" Davis said. "First I looked at my coach, then I looked at my teammates, then 
I looked at the other team, and after that I could hear the crowd go 'Whoa.' " 
</P>
<P>
In fact, all 3 of her points this season have come on technical fouls. Bruder 
said she is one of the best free-throw shooters on the team and can shoot well 
from the field. 
</P>
<P>
"If the defense allows her to shoot, she can. The problem is she isn't that 
quick. By the time she's ready to shoot someone is on her. But then again, 
opponents don't know how to play her. She's attractive and sometimes the other 
players get a little confused. They're afraid to play man-to-man pressing 
defense, so to speak," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had played no organized basketball before this season. So why start now? 
</P>
<P>
"She likes basketball and we don't have a girls' team," Bruder said. "She's not 
trying to be a barnstormer. She played volleyball here and wanted to play 
basketball, too." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bruder concedes that Davis gives the school some publicity, he said 
Davis is out there to play basketball, not promote Oak Hill, which had won only 
2 games in the past 2 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that she tried out for another reason, as well. "I'm always up for 
new adventures," she said. 
</P>
<P>
This adventure has lived up to her expectations. And she had an idea of what to 
expect because she used to play basketball at home with 2 older brothers. And 
Davis credits an ex-boyfriend for also fueling her interest in hoops. "We used 
to practice a lot at Reseda Park," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' mother, Mary Lou, noticed Jeanine's smooth transition to the boys' team 
when she watched Jeanine play against Viewpoint last month. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know that much about basketball, but it looked like she held her own," 
Mary Lou said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruder agrees. "She can keep up with the boys both verbally and athletically -- 
she carries herself very well." 
</P>
<P>
But Bruder confessed that much of Davis' game needs improvement. "When the kids 
were playing at lunch, she would just let it fly. But during practice, we've 
made her understand that when she's open -- take it -- but when she's covered 
she should pass it." 
</P>
<P>
Bruder also said: "She telegraphs her passes and dribbles with her head down 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
But she plays well enough to be the third person off the bench. She averages 8 
minutes a game for Oak Hill (4-3) and is expected to play in tonight's Westside 
League opener against West Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't bother Davis, who plays ahead of 2 other boys. "I'm sure they're 
not happy," Davis said, "but if they put out as much effort as I do, they'll 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Said sophomore guard Matt Freedman, who plays behind Davis, "I don't care. I 
just got used to it after a while." 
</P>
<P>
Players agree that Bruder treats Davis just like anyone else. "If she messes 
up, the coach yells at her just like he yells at us," senior center Philip 
Freed said. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Billy Suharitdumrong concurred, but he added, "We yell at her, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
But don't feel sorry for Davis. Throughout the ordeal, she has established 
rapport with her teammates. Her outgoing off-court demeanor has a lot to do 
with it. "I bag on the guys more than they bag on me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that she remains enthusiastic about playing basketball, except that 
she would like to try something different -- playing against girls. Davis said 
that she enjoys the cozy academic environment at Oak Hill, which has a student 
population of about 90. But next year she might transfer. "It's been a great 
experience," Davis said about playing against boys, "but I wish we had a girls' 
basketball team."

<P>
Julie Arlotto and Bridgette Ealy each scored 12 points Thursday to lead the Cal 
State Northridge women's team to an 84-42 win over Texas College in a 
nonconference game at Texas College. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matadors led, 40-10, at halftime and cruised the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the best ballgames we've played this year," Northridge Coach 
Leslie Milke said. 
</P>
<P>
CSUN improved to 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Canyon College 89, The Master's 53 -- Inger Erickson scored 20 points to 
lead Grand Canyon in a nonconference game at The Master's. 
</P>

San Fernando Valley League opener at Bell-Jeff. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 24-24, entering the final period, but Dancs, Bell-Jeff's 
returning all-league guard, went to work and scored 8 points. For the game, she

THE HIGH SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
INGLEWOOD IS A SITE FOR THE EYES OF COLLEGE BASKETBALL RECRUITERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If UCLA basketball Coach Jim Harrick was allowed territorial rights in the 
Southland, the choice would be nearly automatic. 
</P>
<P>
Four of Southern California's best high school seniors live within a bounce 
pass of each other in the Inglewood area, and UCLA has pursued each of them. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Miner of Inglewood High, Zan Mason of Westchester, Ed Stokes of St. 
Bernard and Mitchell Butler of Oakwood are among the area's most heavily 
recruited players. And according to Butler, all live in the same general 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
How close is Miner, who will attend USC? 
</P>
<P>
"He lives about three or four minutes away," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
What about Mason (UCLA)? 
</P>
<P>
"About five or 10 minutes," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
Stokes (Arizona)? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's about 10 minutes or so," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
All 4 took divergent paths to their respective Pacific 10 Conference schools. 
Butler attends Oakwood, a private Southern Section school of 220 students in 
North Hollywood. Miner attends Inglewood, a public Southern Section school with 
an enrollment of 2,100. Stokes opted for St. Bernard, a parochial Southern 
Section school of 1,250 in Playa del Rey. Mason attends Westchester, a 4-A 
Division school in the City Section. 
</P>
<P>
"Only in L. A.," Butler quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Add Butler: The UCLA-bound senior snapped out of what he called a slump in 
Oakwood's 75-38 win over Windward on Wednesday, scoring 32 points and adding 16 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Oakwood, the defending Southern Section Small Schools champion, is playing at 
the 1-A level and Butler has not posted the same kind of numbers he did in 
1987-88 when he averaged 31 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
However, the promotion to the 1-A level, he said, is not the primary reason for 
his troubles. It was a move of another sort that threw him off balance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little tougher at 1-A, but I've been out of sync," said Butler, The 
Times Valley Player of the Year last season. "It was the move to point guard as 
much as anything, having to distribute the ball and everything." 
</P>
<P>
Butler, who played mainly at center-forward last season, is in charge of 
running the Oakwood offense. That means playing while facing the basket and 
deciding when to dish it out or take it in. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably, over the last six or seven games, I've been a little too unselfish," 
he said. "Last year, I'd normally just take it and go all the way. There will 
probably be a little more of that." 
</P>
<P>
Butler will play at off-guard at UCLA, so the experience has "been good for 
me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodby jinx: Patricia Hayes was not quite sure she was welcome to attend 
Canyon's opening-round game against Highland Hall in the Hart tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Greg Hayes was not sure whether his mother should attend, either. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a jinx," Hayes cracked. "She's been coming to games for the past seven 
years and she's never seen us win." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hayes added, "Nobody saw us win." Canyon suffered through a 3-17 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"At the banquet," Hayes said, "I introduced her and said, 'She's a jinx.' Then 
we had all the lights in the hall flicker and the microphone didn't work. The 
whole place went bonkers. We had fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
Jinx or no jinx, Canyon hammered Highland Hall, 81-21. 
</P>
<P>
"She sincerely is relieved," Hayes said. "She joked about it, but it crossed 
her mind that this was beginning to be real." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes did little to make his mother feel at ease. Before the game he said, "If 
we don't win this one, she's not going to be invited back." 
</P>
<P>
Spartan struggles: Rio Mesa Coach Steve Wolf is counting the days until 6-foot, 
6-inch junior forward Eric Thomas returns to the lineup. Thomas injured his 
left ankle in a game against Hueneme in the Hart tournament and will miss his 
third consecutive game tonight when the Spartans play Channel League foe Dos 
Pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
With Thomas sidelined Wednesday, Rio Mesa narrowly avoided an upset by a 
mediocre Oxnard team in the league opener. The Spartans trailed by 9 points in 
the final minute of the third quarter before eking out a 45-44 win. 
</P>
<P>
"Lucky is an understatement," Wolf said. "Oxnard outplayed us the whole game. 
We were lethargic on defense and they played like it was the most important 
game of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas has yet to practice but Wolf hopes his player will heal in time for 
Monday's game against Buena, Rio Mesa's chief rival for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
Happy New Year: Probably no one is more optimistic about the start of league 
play than Coach Mick Cady and the Notre Dame Knights, who tip off the inaugural 
season of the San Fernando Valley League tonight at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be tested and we were tested early," said Cady, whose team is a 
less-than-impressive 5-8. Notre Dame was tested by Loyola 3 times and failed 
each exam, losing 81-64, 60-58 and 65-62. 
</P>
<P>
In their defense, the Knights played most of the preleague season without 
starters Ken Hicks, who will attend Stanford next year on scholarship, and 
junior Errol Small. Both players, however, "are back at full strength," 
according to Cady. Hicks came back from his injury to score 28 points against 
Banning and Small has averaged 12 points a game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Considering Notre Dame's talent, it could be a long season for league 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to put these things in perspective," Cady said. "You can't expect to 
lose two of your best players and expect to beat the Pasadenas and Loyolas. If 
we make the playoffs, we're going to be hungry to make up for our preseason." 
</P>
<P>
That's the ticket: Cal State Long Beach assistant Seth Greenberg said that the 
49ers were lucky to land Cleveland forward Lucious Harris, who also was being 
courted by Kansas, Providence, Seton Hall, Nevada Las Vegas and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all right there," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who averaged 22.8 points and 10.4 rebounds in the Las Vegas Holiday 
tournament, said that a major reason he selected Long Beach was because he 
wanted to remain near his family. 
</P>
<P>
"That played a pretty big role in it," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg called it one of the biggest steals of the recruiting year. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very fortunate that he decided to stay home and play in front of his 
family and friends," Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Wait until Greenberg sees Harris' ticket-request list: Harris, the youngest of 
the family, has 4 sisters and 3 brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Add Harris: And then again, maybe Long Beach can use the extra bodies. 
</P>
<P>
For last Tuesday's game against Big West Conference archrival Nevada Las Vegas 
and Coach Jerry Tarkanian, a former 49er coach, Long Beach drew only 1,900 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping up with the Joneses: With Dana Jones expected back in the North 
Hollywood lineup for tonight's Valley Pac-8 Conference opener against Grant, 
the Lancers (8-2) will need a solid performance from Chris Cooke to defeat the 
Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke, a 6-7 1/2 senior averaging 7 points a game, struggled in the Lancers' 
first 6 contests but has scored 48 points in Grant's past 4 games, all 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
He scored a season-high 21 points and had 12 rebounds in the Lancers' 69-63 
victory over Poly in the championship game of the Birmingham tournament last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really just a matter of Chris keeping his concentration level up," Grant 
Coach Howard Levine said. "When he concentrates on what he's doing, his 
fundamentals stay sound and he's a good ballplayer."

REARDON TO STAY FOR ANOTHER YEAR AS RIO MESA COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Reardon, Rio Mesa High's football coach for the past 22 years, has decided 
to return for at least one more season. Reardon, 54, had considered retirement 
during the fall when the Spartans posted a 4-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about retiring because there aren't too many people my age 
still coaching football," he said. "But I didn't have a gut feeling about 
leaving. I still enjoy working with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Although Rio Mesa is set for next season, 3 other Valley-area schools are 
looking for football coaches. Crespi will select a replacement for Bill Redell 
from among varsity assistants Jim Benkert, Tim Lins, Joel Wilker and sophomore 
coach Rich Fong, all of whom have applied for the job. Interviews will begin 
next week with a decision expected in 2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
St. Genevieve Principal Rudy Trujillo has set a Jan. 20 deadline for 
applications in his search to replace Kevin Kane. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake Athletic Director Bob Fisher has yet to set a deadline for candidates 
to replace George Contreras, but Fisher has selected a swim coach. Ingrid 
Daland, who runs a youth swim club in Thousand Oaks, will coach the school's 
boys' and girls' teams this spring. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher remains stymied in his search for a boys' tennis coach. Westlake 
advanced to the Southern Section 4-A Division final last season under Coach 
Jaime Barajas, who resigned after the season. JOHN LYNCH

BIG NIGHT IS NOTHING SPECIAL FOR VISTA'S ENGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was just a typical game for Chris Enger, the Vista High School girls' 
basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot 4-inch center had 38 points, 19 rebounds and 14 blocked shots in 
less than three quarters as Vista defeated Fallbrook, 65-31, in Palomar League 
play at Vista. 
</P>
<P>
"They just couldn't stop her tonight," Vista Coach Joe DeMaria said. 
"Defensively, she dominated and offensively, they couldn't keep her from 
getting the ball." 
</P>
<P>
When Vista can get the ball inside to Enger, it will. It did so so much 
Thursday that its next high scorers (Kelli Schott and Renee Richardson) had six 
points each. 
</P>
<P>
"We played probably our best game of the season tonight," DeMaria said. "They 
didn't match up well against Chris. Fallbrook's center, Carol Reed, is only 
5-9, and it's pretty tough for her to stop somebody who is 6-4." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Tippett and Trisha Trujillo each scored seven points for Fallbrook 
(1-1, 10-3). 
</P>
<P>
Palomar League 
</P>
<P>
Torrey Pines 59, Orange Glen 33 -- Tiffany Booth scored 16 points and Karyn 
Armstrong had 15 as Torrey Pines opened league play at Orange Glen. Shannon 
French led Orange Glen (0-2, 5-9) with 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado League 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside 60, Carlsbad 40 -- Kecha Fowlkes scored 21 points, and Mildred 
Constan had 16 to lead host Oceanside. Oceanside is 9-5, 2-0 in league. 
Carlsbad is 0-2 in league. 
</P>
<P>
Ramona 35, Escondido 22 -- Kendra Brunje led Ramona (2-0, 8-1) with 9 points 
and 16 rebounds. Ramona's top 2 scoreres, Kris Miller and Meleea Van Patten 
were held to 6 and 4 points. Ramona had a 39-16 rebound advantage. Escondido is 
0-2 in league play. 
</P>
<P>
Nonleague 
</P>
<P>
Point Loma 74, USDHS 33 -- Monica Filer had 22 points and 15 assists for Point 
Loma (15-1), which also got 16 points from Tyeast Brown and 14 from Chris 
Drumm. Point Loma also had 24 steals. USDHS is 5-4.

FIRST COUPLE'S DEBUT AS THE HOMETOWN TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Marylouise Oates 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Reagan is back -- and you don't need an astrologer to figure out what Los 
Angeles social life is going to be like. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagans' "Welcome Home" party, hosted by Barron Hilton at Merv Griffin's 
Beverly Hilton, produced exactly what had been predicted -- a $1 million take 
for the Nancy Reagan Center. (Hilton himself had generously guaranteed that the 
goal would be met, even if insufficient $1000-a-person tickets or $25,000 
President Circle tables were sold, and made sure it did by having the Hilton 
Hotel Corp. pick up the tab for the entire black-tie bash.) 
</P>
<P>
As forecast, the wonderfully sentimental evening marked the formal re-entry of 
Nancy and Ronald Reagan and produced sufficient societal portends to keep 
everyone busy interpreting their significance until the Reagans actually take 
up Bel-Air residence in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
From both Reagan's formal statement and from the many stories related by close 
friends came a picture of an anxious-to-be-home First Couple. Those who spent 
the holidays with the First Couple at the Rancho Mirage estate of former 
Ambassador Walter and Lee Annenberg repeatedly told how the Reagans were glad 
that their time in Washington was finally drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
But their debut as a hometown team made one thing clear: The almost-former 
First Lady will decide just how and with whom she is going to socialize. 
</P>
<P>
When the dinner plans were announced by Hilton, he offered special President 
Circle tables for $25,000, allowing a special pre-dinner reception with the 
Reagans and seating nearby during the dinner. That plan, those involved with 
seating the dinner said, was changed several days before so that when everyone 
sat down to dinner, the First Friends flanked the First Couple. 
</P>
<P>
That crowd is usually first in line when it comes to contributing, but, 
according to several intimates, the dinner was the third request for a 
Reagan-related contribution in several months, following much more hefty gift 
possibilities to the Reagan Library and to the Bel-Air residence. So Nancy 
Reagan's well-known loyalty meant that, even though the Kitchen Cabinet bought 
the "bargain" $1,000-a-person tickets, seated on either side of the Reagans 
were: former Ambassador Bill and Betty Wilson, Giney Milner, Harriet and Armand 
Deutsch, Erlenne and Norman Sprague, Marion and Earle Jorgenson, Betsy 
Bloomingdale, Chardee and Tuck Trainer and former White House chief of protocol 
Lee Annenberg. Criticism of Nancy Reagan's fashionable friends might have 
forced a low-profile in Washington during the first years of the Reagan 
presidency, but in the gala program book there was a photo of Bloomingdale 
chatting it up with the First Couple, along with several shots of more 
traditional Republican types, like Edward Carter and Margaret Martin Brock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Loyalist Republicans' 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was interesting -- as much in those who didn't turn up as those who 
did. Mrs. Reagan's chief of staff Jack Courtemanche agreed that almost 70% of 
the crowd were "loyalist Republicans." Making their way from the private 
reception were Frances and Armand Hammer; ARCO's Lod and Carole Cook; Carl's 
Jr. head Carl Karcher and his wife, Margaret; producer Jerry Perenchio and his 
wife, Marge, with Ginny Mancini (Henry was out out town); philanthropists Jerry 
and Virginia Oppenheimer; Phyllis Diller; and, of course, Suzanne Marx, who is 
the volunteer in charge of raising money for the Phoenix House drug-abuse 
facility that bears the First Lady's name. 
</P>
<P>
Not showing up: announced star entertainer Frank Sinatra, who called in from 
Palm Springs with a cold. Also noticeably absent: any studio head or major 
agent type, especially since Reagan so values his "Hollywood history." Showing 
up: Don Rickles in an expectedly vicious act, attacking the star level at the 
dinner -- "This is an exciting night. Not one big name showed up" -- and 
repeatedly checking to see if the President was awake, adding lines like "He's 
getting out just in time." Griffin filled in with charm and style for Sinatra, 
but the absence of any curtains or wall coverings in his redone ballroom 
brought complaints from many tables that conversation was impossible during 
dinner, killed off by the acoustics. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, some of the best lines were those that were off the cuff. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. T. strolled by, resplendent in gold lame "Why, he's got the most jewels of 
anyone," publicist Jeffrey Lane informed Joan Collins. 
</P>
<P>
Former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, whom Reagan defeated in his first win as 
governor in 1966, was there -- "as a guest," his wife, Bernice, pointed out. "I 
started him on his career," Brown quipped. "I should be here to see him end 
it."

There are two national genealogical conferences planned for this year, plus an 
important regional one in Southern California -- the Jamboree. Now is the time 
to make plans to attend. These conferences are exciting learning experiences. 
</P>
<P>
The one-day Jamboree will be April 30 at the Pasadena Center, 300 E. Green St. 
This 20th annual event includes speakers on many genealogical research topics, 
plus offers genealogists an opportunity to obtain material and books on many 
subjects. More than 200 vendors participate, offering everything from books to 
computer software. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning classes in genealogy are presented throughout the day in addition to 
the specialized lectures. 
</P>
<P>
To place your name on the Jamboree's "Genealogy: A Cooperative Venture" 
contact: Jamboree, Southern California Genealogical Society, P.O. Box 4377, 
Burbank 91503, or call (818) 843-7247. 
</P>
<P>
The National Genealogical Society's annual conference will be May 17-20 in St. 
Paul, Minn. In addition to many lectures on research methodology, there will be 
sessions to provide guidance in research in specific areas, the use of 
particular records and the resources of numerous repositories. 
</P>
<P>
Two innovative aspects of the St. Paul program will be a computer-aided 
genealogy learning center and a five-part seminar for educators, both scheduled 
for May 20. The educators' sessions are designed for non-genealogists who wish 
to integrate genealogical instruction into their curricula. 
</P>
<P>
The St. Paul colloquy will take advantage of the rich ethnic heritage of the 
Upper Midwest, offering classes for those with Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, 
Eastern European, American Indian, Welsh, German, Bohemian, Swiss, Polish, 
Irish and black roots. A number of sessions will relate to Canadian resources. 
</P>
<P>
Registration fee for this conference is $80. To receive a registration form, 
write: NGS Conference, 4527 17th St. North, Arlington, Va. 22207-2399. 
</P>
<P>
Aug. 16-19 are the dates for Federation of Genealogical Societies conference. 
This conference will be hosted by the Seattle Genealogical Society and held at 
the Red Lion Inn at the Seattle-Tacoma airport.

The next Administration in Washington could do for Victor Costa -- the 
Dallas-based designer known for reasonably priced cocktail and evening gowns -- 
what the last one did for Galanos and Adolfo. Marilyn Quayle, wife of the next 
vice president, recently ordered three ensembles from Costa's New York 
showroom. Costa told Listen she will wear a jade-green silk satin ball gown -- 
very covered up with long sleeves and a portrait neckline -- to the Inaugural 
Ball Jan. 20. President-elect George Bush's daughter, Dorothy LeBlond, will 
wear a Costa also ("I'm not sure which one," Costa says), as will his 
daughter-in-law Laura (wife of George Bush Jr.), who chose a "regal" purple 
tulle and satin gown. And that's not all. Penne Korth, co-chair of the 
Inauguration festivities, is also going the Costa route, as are Susan Baker, 
wife of James, the next secretary of state, and Texas socialites Margaret Crow 
and Nancy Brinker. Costa says: "The sobriety, the sanity of the Bush Era are 
sending them all to my door. There aren't any $10,000 dresses in this 
Administration that I know of."Come Out Fighting . . .

It is possible that the next L.A. fitness craze will be boxing. Don't laugh. We 
talked with 5-foot-2 amateur bantamweight Ruth Kramer Ziony, who says she runs 
in Griffith Park with boxers every morning, spars with them at a professional 
gym every noon and has lived and breathed boxing for the past two years because 
it is "a wonderful mental sport, a physical form of chess." Ziony is not 
talking war games here, folks, but fine technique and physical grit: "I have a 
background in ballet, and I assure you that you don't just hit the bag. You 
have to learn to throw a jab the way you learn to plie. Boxing is a metaphor 
for life. I train every day, build up my strength, avoid osteoporosis and burn 
lots of calories. That means I can eat." Ziony, who hopes to write a book about 
it all, says even the boxing fashions are great. She wears silver-touched shoes 
made by a Spanish zapatero and sold at Margo's, a downtown Los Angeles store 
that offers authentic, Mexican-made boxing gear, Ziony says. And her collection 
of T-shirts is "one of the most interesting in town," she adds, because every 
top fighter puts his picture on shirts before a big fight, and she's been 
collecting them all. We plan to meet her in a well-lit place one day soon, to 
get the rest of the story.

Much Ado About Brides 
</P>
<P>
The February/March issue of Bride's magazine has hit the newsstands, weighing 
in at almost four pounds. There are 948 pages (official count) dedicated to 
gowns, veils, tuxedos, linens, china, crystal and good-old etiquette. Associate 
editor Milli Martini Bratten tells us "many people get engaged around Christmas 
and the holidays. The majority of weddings will take place May through October, 
and people need time to plan." Bratten says bridal etiquette today often 
surrounds "blended families. We get questions about where to sit parents who 
are divorced and don't speak to each other. Women who are marrying men with 
children have asked: 'Do they come on the honeymoon with us?' " We don't know 
about you, but Listen votes no on that one.

A Saudi Arabian tanker caught in a storm in the southern Persian Gulf was left 
ablaze in the Strait of Hormuz with eight of its crewmen missing, shipping 
executives reported. They identified the vessel as the 36,904-ton Sagheera, 
manned by a 34-member crew of Greek officers and Sri Lankan sailors. The Omani 
navy rescued 26 crew members in lifeboats but eight remained unaccounted for, 
the shipping officials said. It was not immediately known what started the fire 
aboard the Sagheera or where the ship was headed. The storm was said to have 
caused waves as high as 30 feet in the southern gulf and in the strait.

KIDNAPERS WANT DRUG KINGPIN RELEASED

Gunmen in Colombia who reportedly kidnaped two U.S. missionaries have demanded 
the release of Carlos Lehder Rivas, an extradited drug kingpin sentenced in the 
United States last year to life without parole, a spokesman for the Protestant 
missionary group said. The gunmen, believed to be drug traffickers, also 
threatened to kill one missionary for every Colombian extradited to the United 
States to face drug charges, according to Hector Pardo of the Colombian 
Evangelical Federations. Missionaries Richard Grover, 50, of Minneapolis, and 
Roy Libby, 50, of Atlanta, were kidnaped Tuesday night in the southwestern 
village of La Florida.

The U.S. Air Force is considering moving some jet fighter training missions to 
Morocco as a way to ease the burden over densely populated West Germany, the 
Air Force's European chief said. Gen. William L. Kirk, in an Associated Press 
interview, staunchly defended the need to continue low-level training missions 
in Central Europe. The training missions have caused controversy in West 
Germany because of military jet crashes in the country. Talks with Morocco are 
at a "very preliminary stage," Kirk said in his office at the U.S. air base in 
Ramstein. The base was the site of a fiery crash of an Italian air force stunt 
team that killed 70 people at an air show in August. Five West Germans and the 
pilot died in a U.S. military jet crash Dec. 8 in Remscheid.

The Coast Guard said that divers found "very serious cracks" in the hull of an 
874-foot tanker and that 33,600 gallons of crude oil had leaked into Valdez 
harbor, the terminus of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The spill is the largest 
at the oil port since the pipeline began pumping crude oil from Prudhoe Bay, 
America's largest oil field, in 1977, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Steven McCall in 
Valdez. Cleanup was continuing for the third day, and most of the oil was 
contained by booms around the ship but sheens of oil were visible on the water 
outside the booms.

A man who allegedly suffered from psychosis triggered by cough medicine 
addiction and a fall from bed was convicted of second-degree murder in the 
shooting death of his best friend. James George Sussman, 39, faces 15 years to 
life in prison for the slaying last year of George Moore, 50, at Sussman's Los 
Gatos home. The sanity phase of Sussman's trial in Santa Clara County Superior 
Court will begin Monday. The prosecution contended Sussman killed Moore during 
a lover's quarrel. But defense attorney Pat Tondreau said the men were not 
lovers, and that Sussman had a "psychotic delusional episode" in which he 
thought he had to kill Moore to prevent the world from ending. Tondreau said 
the episode was brought on by a high level of dextromethorphan, an active 
ingredient in some cough syrups, and a blow to the head when Sussman fell out 
of bed shortly before the shooting.

Jury trials for 248 anti-abortion demonstrators arrested on misdemeanor 
trespassing charges in Sunnyvale last October could cost Santa Clara County up 
to $1.8 million. The cost represents almost 10% of the Municipal Court system's 
operating budget for 1988-89. The large number of defendants and their request 
for speedy trials has already prompted a declaration of judicial emergency in 
the county. The demonstrators are members of New York-based Operation Rescue, a 
group whose protests nationwide have clogged jails and courts in more than 30 
cities.

An Oakland man who witnesses said wanted to make traffic move faster so one of 
his passengers could get to a bathroom was charged with fatally shooting 
another motorist on a freeway. Darryl Ray Poole, 19, of Oakland, is being held 
in Oakland's city jail without bail. He is accused of killing Lawrence 
Ellingsen, 53, on the Nimitz Freeway on Dec. 3 as Ellingsen and his wife, 
Sherri, were driving home to Newark after celebrating their 29th wedding 
anniversary. A bullet pierced the rear window of their car and struck him in 
the head. Mrs. Ellingsen managed to gain control of the car and steer it to the 
side of the road. She called her husband's death "so unrealistic. . . . To 
shoot at someone going 60 to 65 m.p.h. because someone had to go to the 
bathroom? I just can't imagine what kind of people we're dealing with."An 
anonymous phone tip led to Poole's arrest, police said.

The Federal Aviation Administration, ending years of research and controversy, 
issued a requirement for large air transport planes to have devices that warn a 
pilot of an impending collision. All commercial jetliners with 30 or more seats 
will have to have the device, known as T-CAS, by December 30, 1991. For some 
time, the FAA has let it be known it was preparing such a requirement. Several 
airlines have been using T-CAS units on a test basis on a smallnumber of planes 
for more than a year. Transportation Secretary James H. Burley IV called 
installation of the collision avoidance technology in aircraft "one of the most 
significant safety initiatives in recent years."

CHIEF DEFENDS POLICEMAN WHO SHOT YOUTH 11 TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen-year-old Robert Scriven took at least 11 gunshots in his body in his 
fatal struggle with an Escondido police officer, Police Chief Vince Jimno said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Jimno said he found no fault with Officer Martin Hewlett's handling of the 
situation, especially given that Hewlett had lost the upper hand in the 
struggle, was pinned to the ground and was fighting to retain control of his 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett had chased Scriven into a brush-and-bamboo thicket just before midnight 
Monday after Scriven was seen running a stop sign in a stolen sports car, 
police said. They said Scriven was fleeing Hewlett and another officer in a 
chase on the north side of Escondido before he lost control of his vehicle, 
jumped out and took off on foot into the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Taller and Heavier 
</P>
<P>
Hewlett caught up with the Escondido teen-ager in the dense vegetation, and the 
two began struggling, according to official police reports. Although Hewlett is 
taller and heavier than the boy, he found himself pinned on his back and 
"feared for his life," Jimno said Thursday, elaborating on the incident after 
having talked to Hewlett. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old officer, a four-year veteran of the Escondido Police 
Department, is on routine administrative leave pending an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"In my mind I don't feel anxious about it at all," Jimno said of the pending 
investigation, which will be conducted by both his department and the San Diego 
County Sheriff's Department before being turned over to the district attorney's 
office for evaluation. Jimno's department will then conduct an internal review 
of the shooting, as is customary whenever an officer fires his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"This forces us to think about our procedures and practices, whether we are 
doing it the right way," Jimno said. "Each time we have (a shooting), we review 
it in detail to see if there's anything we can do differently so this won't 
occur again." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incidents Create Tension 
</P>
<P>
Such incidents create tension for the entire department, he said. "The officers 
watch very closely to see how the department responds to the innuendo, the 
allegations or whatever else occurs in the media, to see if the department will 
be supportive of them and stand by them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jimno said officers are especially concerned about public reaction to the 
shooting of the teen-ager, who was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not rooting," he said. "They're saying, 'Thank God Hewlett is OK.' 
They're quiet. They're not real excited about this. The concern they have now 
is, what will people think of us again?" 
</P>
<P>
Department morale plummeted in 1983 when an officer mistakenly shot and killed 
Leslie Landersman, an office secretary who had been taken hostage by a bank 
robber. The gunman kidnaped her after escaping in a shoot-out with police and 
forced her to be his getaway driver in her own vehicle. Landersman was slain by 
police fire when she lunged to free herself from her captor after they found 
themselves trapped on a cul-de-sac and surrounded by officers. The robber was 
also shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
The department also suffered from the fallout publicity on the way officers 
handled the situation. During a 13-minute stretch, 10 officers fired their 
shotguns 12 times and their handguns 35 times. Five officers were disciplined 
for actions contrary to department policies; the most severely punished was a 
lieutenant whose own gunfire hit the door of another police car, behind which 
another officer had taken cover. 
</P>
<P>
But Jimno and others say no parallels should be drawn between the 1983 
shoot-out and what occurred Monday night. In the more recent incident, Jimno 
said, an officer's own life was on the line because of a criminal suspect who 
not only resisted arrest but also tried to wrest the officer's gun from him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame it was a 17-year-old, but a 17-year-old can kill you as easily as 
a 27-year-old," Jimno said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sense in Second-Guessing 
</P>
<P>
Nothing will be gained by trying to second-guess why Hewlett fired off as many 
shots as he did, Jimno said. 
</P>
<P>
"People will question that, but they haven't been through something like this," 
the chief said. "Hewlett really thought he was going to die. He was fighting 
for his life." 
</P>
<P>
Jimno said Hewlett and Scriven had been struggling for nearly two minutes, and 
the officer was having little success against the teen. Scriven had recently 
been released from the California Youth Authority for stealing a car, and had 
done body building while in custody. Scriven was 5 feet, 10 inches tall and 
weighed 170 pounds; Hewlett is described by police as taller than 6 feet and 
husky. 
</P>
<P>
Jimno said this was the situation Monday night as he understood it: 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely dark, the guy (Hewlett) isn't getting any help (because other 
officers hadn't arrived yet), he's getting whipped now, the guy's right on top 
of him, he's very tired and the other guy is getting the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer reaches for his gun, the other guy tries to grab it out of his 
hand, so the officer shoots while the guy is on top of him, and when the guy 
gets off of him, he (Hewlett) doesn't know if he'll come back after him again. 
He shoots some more. It's human nature to shoot until the attacker stops, 
whether it's one shot or 15." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Keeping Track 
</P>
<P>
Jimno said it was unlikely that Hewlett tracked in his mind how many shots he 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people in these kinds of life-and-death struggles have no idea how many 
shots they've fired," he said. "An officer will swear he only shot his revolver 
once, yet all six shots of his revolver have been fired." 
</P>
<P>
Jimno said his department received word from the county coroner's office 
Thursday that 11 bullets had been taken from Scriven's body. It was unclear, 
however, whether Scriven had also been struck by bullets that passed through 
his body. 
</P>
<P>
The department uses soft-nose, hollow-pointed bullets designed to mushroom on 
impact and remain in the body, to reduce the risk of striking someone in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a philosophy of shoot to wound," Jimno said. "You shoot to stop 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Coroner Max Murphy said Thursday that Scriven died of "multiple gunshot 
wounds," but said other details, including how many times Scriven had been 
shot, will not be disclosed until the final autopsy report is released in about 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
That report will include toxicology findings that will show whether Scriven's 
body contained any drugs.

The board, on a 3-1 vote, directed its staff to argue at City Council hearings 
against a provision in the proposed Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan 
that prohibits development of Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons for garbage 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Last May, three of the five supervisors -- Deane Dana, Mike Antonovich and Ed 
Edelman -- said they either opposed a landfill in the canyons or that they 
would consider it only as a last resort to solve long-range garbage disposal 
problems.

NEW COLD SPELL TO GIVE GROWERS A FROST TO BEAR

San Diegans may want to replace their raincoats and galoshes with overcoats and 
long johns this weekend, when the rain will dissipate and cold weather will 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Remnants of a storm from the upper region of the Gulf of Alaska will bring a 
mighty chilly weekend to the county, the National Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
The chance of rain will lessen throughout the weekend, with a 40% chance of 
showers today and 10% to 20% Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But a cold front lingering from a storm that brought rain Thursday prompted the 
National Weather Service to issue a frost advisory for the weekend, especially 
Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Weather Service forecaster Wilbur Shigehara urged growers to take precautions 
to protect their crops this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We may see frost right to the beaches," Shigehara said. "Del Mar might have 
some frost. It looks like a decent weekend coming up. But it's going to be 
plenty cold." 
</P>
<P>
The weekend will be partly cloudy and cold, with highs in the middle 50s and 
the possibility of some sunshine Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"The unusual thing about the storm is it's packing a lot of cold air," 
Shigehara said. "Once the storm goes by, it's going to start drying out. 
Sunday, there will be a lot more sunshine for the tourists. We're going to have 
a pretty cold weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Shigehara said the snow level may drop to 2,000 feet in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal lows will dip into the 30s, while the inland area is expected to drop 
into the 20s. 
</P>
<P>
The Weather Service also issued a snow advisory in the mountains for today. 
Mountain temperatures aren't expected to rise much above freezing through the 
weekend, and a few snow flurries are due. Daytime temperatures will reach the 
middle 30s, with nightly lows dropping below 20. Gusty mountain winds may reach 
30 to 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The desert will be partly cloudy with a 10% to 20% chance of showers, but 
sunshine is predicted for Sunday. It's expected to be cold and windy in the 
desert, with highs in the mid-50s and overnight temperatures from 28 to 35. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is 2 to 4 feet, and the ocean temperature is a brisk 55.

HOPE ON HORIZON FOR OFFSHORE-DRILLING FOES; 
</P>
<P>
NOMINEE TO HEAD INTERIOR DEPARTMENT IS PERSONAL FRIEND OF RON PACKARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when things were looking grim for opponents of oil drilling off the San 
Diego County coast, a glimmer of hope has appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the renewed optimism is the selection of a close friend of Rep. 
Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) for the influential post of secretary of the Interior. 
The Department of Interior will play a big role in dictating whether oil 
platforms sprout from local waters. 
</P>
<P>
Packard, a staunch opponent of offshore drilling, served on the House Science 
and Technology Committee with former Republican Rep. Manuel Lujan Jr. of New 
Mexico, the nominee to become secretary of the Interior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Sympathetic Ear 
</P>
<P>
The close working relationship the two enjoyed in Congress, Packard said, could 
mean that local officials will have a more sympathetic ear at Interior. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, I'm a little more optimistic," Packard said Thursday. "We may get 
disappointed, but right now our options and our hopes are better than they 
were." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the situation had appeared particularly dire for North County of late. 
In November, the federal government took steps toward the leasing of 17 
sea-bottom tracts for oil drilling off the coast of Camp Pendleton, Oceanside 
and Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
That package was added to an earlier lease proposal, announced by Interior in 
mid-1987, extending from San Luis Obispo to Mexico and including more than 
1,300 tracts, most of them covering about 9 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
Packard talked by telephone Thursday with Lujan, a 20-year veteran of Congress 
who retired this year, and came away with an agreement that the two will meet 
to discuss the offshore oil issue in February after Lujan is officially 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Although Lujan emphasized during the conversation that he would "have to follow 
the dictates of the President," he enters the fray with a "very objective and 
open-minded" attitude toward the myriad issues in the oil-drilling debate, 
Packard said. 
</P>
<P>
Lujan could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Past Chiefs Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and other opponents of drilling have long criticized Interior 
chiefs such as James G. Watt and Donald P. Hodel, saying they pushed an 
overzealous campaign to tap the oil that lies off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
When President-elect George Bush announced the selection of Lujan on Dec. 22, 
both liberals and conservatives praised the choice, saying the longtime 
congressman would prove effective in developing a natural-resources policy with 
the sort of broad public support not achieved under the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
A politician who prefers compromise to confrontation, Lujan was the ranking 
Republican on the House Interior Committee until he resigned because of his 
aversion to the political contention caused by Watt's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
His nomination to the Interior post, however, was viewed as a disappointment by 
some national environmental groups. In the 100th Congress, Lujan cast his lot 
with environmentalists on only 16% of the votes, according to the League of 
Conservation Voters. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least, Packard said, Lujan should have "a good listening ear" for 
the concerns of San Diego County residents and lawmakers worried about the 
environmental and aesthetic effects of drilling on the fragile coastline. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Made Trips Together 
</P>
<P>
While serving on the science committee together, Packard and Lujan made several 
committee trips together and their wives became close friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we know each other, we respect each other and like each other well," 
Packard said. "I'll certainly have a link to his office, and that certainly 
will not hurt. I'm pleased to know he's there." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Packard has had little success trying to negotiate with Hodel, the 
outgoing Interior secretary.

Police arrested a Clairemont man Thursday as a suspect in an assault on a 
comatose 11-year-old patient at a rehabilitation facility. 
</P>
<P>
Noel Allie Sanchez, 22, an employee at the Lake Erie Institute of 
Rehabilitation on Alvarado Road since it opened in August, was booked on 
suspicion of felony child molestation and rape with a foreign object. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was molested sometime between midnight and 6 a.m. Dec. 24, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members noticed irregularities and contacted a doctor the same day, said 
Patricia Lojewski, executive vice president of the facility. "We consistently 
acted in our patient's best interest," Lojewski said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was absolutely shocked that (the suspect) was one of our staff, but I'm 
happy that an arrest was made," Lojewski said. "I'm also happy that it was our 
staff that noticed that something wasn't quite right and notified the 
authorities."

The sole occupant of a small plane that apparently ran out of fuel made an 
emergency landing just short of the runway at Montgomery Field on Thursday 
night, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, identified by San Diego police as William Russell of La Jolla, was 
not injured. There were no passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Police Lt. John Kern said Russell was approaching Montgomery Field from the 
east in his two-seat, experimental plane about 6:45 p.m. when the engine died. 
Russell brought the aircraft down in a grassy area about a quarter of a mile 
east of the runway. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart Cochran, a pilot who was at the airport when the landing occurred, 
described Russell's plane as a home-built, experimental craft known as a 
Glasair. 
</P>
<P>
"That plane may have saved his life," said Cochran, president of the San Diego 
chapter of the National Experimental Aircraft Assn. "It's an all-composite 
aircraft and it's very strong." 
</P>
<P>
Police said the plane remained upright. It was moderately damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the darkness and light rain, police and firefighters had a difficult 
time locating the craft. By the time they reached Russell, he reportedly was 
walking around the aircraft checking for damage. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear Thursday where Russell's flight had begun.

A Delta Air Lines flight that took off at 12:30 p.m. Thursday for Atlanta 
returned to San Diego after a bomb threat was called in shortly after takeoff, 
said Rick Beckett, district marketing manager for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers of Flight 250, nonstop to Atlanta, were forced to deplane so a 
search of luggage and passengers could be made. 
</P>
<P>
"It's standard procedure to check everything," Beckett said. "We don't take any 
chances." The flight was rescheduled to depart at 2:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Beckett declined to comment further on the incident. "I hate to give (the 
callers) the notoriety they're looking for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21, 
there have been three bomb threats at Lindbergh Field, airport manager Bud 
McDonnell said. One threat was on an American Airlines flight Dec. 30 and 
another occurred Wednesday on a Southwest Airlines jet. Thursday's threat made 
the third, McDonnell said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Flight 103 that has triggered (the bomb threats)," McDonnell said. "They 
come in bunches. It's like a snowball or domino effect."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LA MESA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former principal of a church school in La Mesa was sentenced Thursday to 
two years in County Jail for molesting two female students. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Lee Petersen, 37, of La Mesa was arrested immediately after the 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Municipal Judge Jesus Rodriguez placed Petersen on 10 years' 
probation, ordered him to register with the police as a sex offender and 
forbade him from having any contacts with minors except in the presence of a 
responsible adult who knows of his convictions. 
</P>
<P>
The judge further ordered Petersen, who also taught seventh- and eighth-graders 
at St. Luke's Lutheran Day School, never to teach again, and fined him $1,000. 
Petersen is also prohibited from frequenting places where minors congregate, 
but he is allowed to visit with his son. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize what I did was a terrible, terrible act," Petersen told Rodriguez. 
"It's very painful to see a dark side of your life." 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 14, Petersen pleaded guilty to three counts of child molestation. Nine 
other counts were dropped. Under terms of the plea bargain, Petersen could have 
faced a maximum sentence of three years in custody and a $3,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The former pastor of the church, Gottfriend Hoffman, 65, of La Mesa has been 
charged with one misdemeanor count of failing to inform authorities about the 
molestations after he allegedly learned of them. Hoffman also faces a felony 
charged of being an accessory to the molestation after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman's preliminary hearing is set for Jan. 18. He has pleaded innocent to 
both charges.

BERNARDI FEELING 'JUST FINE' A DAY AFTER FALL IN HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi said Thursday that he feels "just 
fine" after being hospitalized for a head injury from a fall at his Van Nuys 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he still plans to run for reelection in April, the northeast San 
Fernando Valley councilman said in a telephone interview from his room at 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City, "as of now, certainly." 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old Bernardi, suffering from a flu-like virus, received five 
stitches to the back of his head Wednesday after collapsing and hitting his 
head on a kitchen cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
He said he expects to stay at the hospital for a few days for tests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Better to Stay' 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's better to stay in here a couple of days to be sure that there are 
no complications, to be sure I am in good shape," said Bernardi, who has gotten 
up and walked around his hospital room. "I hope to be out in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
"There are no indications of major problems," added hospital spokeswoman Karen 
Large. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, who has been sick with the virus for several days, said he was in the 
kitchen when he jumped from a stool to answer the phone. 
</P>
<P>
"I fell and apparently hit my head against the sharp edge of a kitchen 
cabinet," he said. "It knocked me out, besides putting a gash in my head." 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi said he is in the hospital's coronary care unit for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi is the council dean with 27 years of service.

FAN PLEADS NO CONTEST TO BITING REFEREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles man pleaded no contest Thursday to biting off part of a referee's 
ear after a soccer game at Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Encarnacion Celestino Cifuentes, 39, was charged with mayhem in the July 17, 
1988, biting of Santos Gonzales, 41, of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Mayhem is defined by the state penal code as the malicious disfigurement or 
dismemberment of another person. 
</P>
<P>
It carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison, but in exchange for 
Cifuentes' no-contest plea, prosecutors agreed to seek no more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lloyd M. Nash said he will probably seek a prison term for 
Cifuentes but would not be more specific. Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. 
Haber scheduled sentencing for Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Cifuentes' attorney, Deputy Public Defender Daniel Alan Kuperberg, told Haber 
that his client is innocent but did not want to risk a more severe sentence if 
he were to be convicted at a trial. 
</P>
<P>
During the game between players of Salvadoran descent and players of Guatemalan 
descent, Cifuentes, a spectator, disputed a call Gonzales had made against the 
Guatemalan team, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
After the match, Cifuentes grabbed Gonzales from behind and bit off about half 
an inch of his ear, Nash said. 
</P>
<P>
A no-contest plea is treated the same as a guilty plea by California criminal 
courts.

PANEL RULES THAT ADULT BOOKSTORE IS BEYOND REACH OF DISTANCE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Van Nuys adult bookstore, which had been ordered to close because it violated 
a Los Angeles ordinance prohibiting such shops within 500 feet of homes, is 
instead open for business -- thanks to a change in city measurement policy. 
</P>
<P>
In a unique case, city zoning officials decided that Adult World bookstore in 
the 6400 block of Van Nuys Boulevard could remain open because there is enough 
space -- 510 feet -- between it and a four-unit apartment complex across a 
parking lot. A previous city measurement had showed the distance to be 429 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Dec. 13 decision has angered representatives of the Van Nuys Homeowners 
Assn. They vowed to find a way to change the ruling, although the city 
attorney's office said such decisions by the Board of Zoning Appeals are final 
and cannot be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be looking for any way to bring this issue out again," said Don 
Shultz, a member of the association's board of directors. "We feel the city 
should have ruled in a conservative manner on this case. The community does not 
benefit from this type of business." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs, who represents the Van Nuys area, is looking into the 
decision to determine whether he should introduce an amendment to the city law 
clarifying how measurements should be taken, said Renee Weitzer, his land-use 
aide. 
</P>
<P>
Buddy Green, owner of Adult World, and his attorney, Roger J. Diamond, 
convinced the zoning board that the back wall of the building, which is 510 
feet from the apartments, should be used as the marker. 
</P>
<P>
City inspectors had measured the distance from Adult World's property line, 
which is 429 feet away. Based on that measurement, the city ordered Green to 
close his 4 1/2-year-old business. Green and Diamond appealed the order based 
on an ambiguity in the city ordinance that does not state what the points of 
measurement between a residence and an adult business must be. 
</P>
<P>
City inspectors had been measuring from the lot line of businesses to the lot 
line of homes, said James Carney, chief building inspector. As a result of the 
decision, he said, inspectors will now measure from the walls of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
However, that decision will not affect six other city cases in which the owners 
of adult entertainment businesses are appealing orders to close because of 
their proximity to homes, schools or parks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any cases that are this close," Carney said, referring to the 
distance between Adult World and the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Matter of Interpretation 
</P>
<P>
Nikolas Patsaouras, chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals, said the panel 
interpreted the 1986 city ordinance to mean that the measurement, in the Adult 
World case, should be taken from the building and not the lot line. 
</P>
<P>
"The code says 500 feet away from the establishment," Patsaouras said. "It 
doesn't make sense" to measure from the property line because the Adult World 
parking lot buffers it from the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not try to rule on the morality of this," Patsaouras said. "You and I 
may be opposed to these kinds of things, but the board considers land-use 
matters, not moral matters." 
</P>
<P>
None of the tenants of the apartment complex, along the 6400 block of Sylvan 
Street, protested the proximity of Adult World. From their porches, it is 
difficult to read Adult World's back-lot sign. One woman said she was not 
bothered by the shop and wasn't aware that the apartments were involved in the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Green, a member of the Van Nuys Chamber of Commerce, said that he "wants to be 
a good neighbor" and will tone down the sign in front of his building by 
removing the "XXX" letters and changing "25 cent movie arcade" to "25 cent 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
"I run my store like a normal everyday business," Green said. "We are not out 
to wave any red flags. We want to cooperate with our neighbors."

They are sculptured, expensive, pampered and haughty. 
</P>
<P>
And like all stars attending any international festival, these cosseted cars 
have been arriving by air from around the world for Saturday's premiere of the 
1989 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show at the Los Angeles Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
From Crewe, England, where it is crafted alongside the Rolls-Royce, came the 
new Bentley Turbo R. The car costs $149,000. The British Airways flight cost a 
mere $12,000. 
</P>
<P>
From West Germany, on a Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt, came two new cars by 
Bitter. One is a prototype four-door sedan. The other is a production two-door 
convertible. Both are big-ticket and aimed at the consumer who wants a German 
car that isn't seen everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Luxury Four-Wheel Drive 
</P>
<P>
From Italy, aboard Alitalia, came the first of the Laforzas, an upmarket, 
$43,000, four-wheel drive vehicle. Its manufacturer is hoping to dethrone the 
British-built Range Rover from its ermine pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
"For nine days we will be spotlighting the products of all manufacturers from 
all countries," said Ben Orloff, manager of the Los Angeles show, which now is 
in its 67th year. "That will translate to 500,000 people examining 650 new 
cars, trucks and vans at a show that's a 500,000-square-foot showroom." 
</P>
<P>
That showroom will also be displaying more first season players than the 
opening day of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti lines -- luxury boats all -- will merge 
approving glances with glazed stares from customers who never thought they'd 
see the day when any Japanese car would cost $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrolet is introducing the Lumina line, a coupe, a four-door sedan and an APV 
(All-Purpose Vehicle) -- a new family of vehicles for families with children, 
desires for maximum grocery space, multiple entrances and outdoor pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
Geo, the new import sales arm of Chevrolet, is out to snare whatever 
entry-level motorists might be left over from Hyundai and Daihatsu with the 
Prizm, a family hatchback expected to sell for less than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the high-line cars -- the ones we wouldn't have the gall to drive, 
even if we had the money to buy -- that sell the shows and the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Such as that 140-m.p.h. Bentley Turbo R, once described by David E. Davis Jr., 
publisher of Automobile magazine, as the car that will "replace the Ferrari 
Testarossa and the Lamborghini Countach as the most 'in' car in which bicoastal 
trendies can be seen." 
</P>
<P>
For the purchase price of a Turbo R, you could buy 20 Plymouth Horizons. Eleven 
cows gave leather to upholster the Bentley. Its turbocharger was built by 
Garrett for airplanes. It is the highest combination of elegance and power 
since elephants wore gold saddles. 
</P>
<P>
But who on Earth -- let alone in Beverly Hills -- would want such a car? "Merv 
Griffin, Barbra Streisand, Bijan and Jay Leno all drive Bentleys," a company 
spokesman replied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off-Road Luxury 
</P>
<P>
The new Laforza (Italian for "strength") is a rural and off-road luxury vehicle 
-- from leather seats to burled walnut dash and audiophile sound system -- that 
by purpose and $43,000 base price will attempt to give the British-built Range 
Rover (at $35,800) a tug for its 4WD money. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian-American hybrid, the vehicle is powered by a 5-liter Ford engine 
installed in the United States. The rolling chassis, body and interior are 
designed, assembled and shipped by Italian coach builder Pininfarina. 
</P>
<P>
"Range Rover is stately, has heritage, is the queen's choice and is a superb 
vehicle in its class," noted Gene Stinson, senior vice president of Laforza 
Automobiles Inc., of Hayward and Turin, Italy. "But our buyers will be offered 
the aerodynamic look and greater luxury in a vehicle with 40% greater carrying 
capacity, smaller turning circle and a 40% greater towing capacity." 
</P>
<P>
Bitter is back with the Bitter Type 3, a heftier advertising budget and loftier 
marketing ideas, in an attempt to find the California niche it has been 
pursuing since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we are going from almost total handcrafting to a car that is 50% 
(machine) production," explained Jim Reilly, general sales manager for Bitter 
Automobile Co. of Santa Monica. "As far as price goes ($47,000), we'll be in 
the mid-range of manufacturers like Mercedes and BMW. But much better 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
"The Germans make great interiors. But they do tend to be a little vanilla. The 
Bitter has sharp looks on the outside and it's real sexy. The interior will be 
African rosewood and Italian glove leather with a Blaupunkt stereo system so a 
driver can sit in Los Angeles traffic all day and not get bored." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
West German Convertible 
</P>
<P>
The Type 3, manufactured in Schwelm, West Germany, is a two-door convertible 
with an in-line, six-cylinder engine by Opel. The car develops 210 horsepower 
and has an estimated top speed of 140 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Porsche will be introducing three new cars to Southern California -- an area 
with a larger Porsche population than all of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Spotlighted on the main turntable will be the Carrera 4, a $69,500 version and 
revision of the venerable 911. This one features all-wheel drive and other 
technological goodies cannibalized from the company's 959 supercar. 
</P>
<P>
Porsche also will be displaying its S2 Cabriolet ($52,600), a convertible 
version of the 944, with a new 3-liter engine; and a new 911 Speedster 
($65,480) attempting to recapture some of the cheeky elan of the bathtub 
Porsches of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen is moving deeper into the power picture with a 140-m.p.h. VW Corrado 
that will replace the Sirocco in the high-performance, small-sedan market. 
</P>
<P>
Audi has a new speed toy for 1989 -- a four-door, V8 sedan also said to be good 
for speeds in excess of 140 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hidden Surprises 
</P>
<P>
High performance, in fact, will be a hallmark of the show. From Ford come the 
Taurus SHO (for Super High Output) and the supercharged Thunderbird SC (for 
Super Coupe). From Mitsubishi comes the turbocharged Eclipse that will also be 
marketed through Chrysler as the Laser. All are sports cars beneath docile duds 
and capable of 140 m.p.h. and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
Even the beyond will be represented in Los Angeles -- as Chevrolet unveils, 
nay, uncages its Corvette ZR1, a limited-production, specially engineered, 
heavily armed Top Gun. 
</P>
<P>
This most expensive and fastest Chevrolet ever will go on sale later this year 
for $50,000. Insurance may be almost as much. The ZR1 is a 180 m.p.h. car. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the Ferrari of the domestics," said Mickey Garrett, executive vice 
president of the Greater Los Angeles Motor Car Dealers Assn., which endorses 
the show. "Buyers are demanding more horsepower -- but from engines that 
provide good fuel economy -- and that trend will be visible at the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, there's definitely a return to the luxury car, especially in Southern 
California. The Japanese are seeing the importance of that market and you'll 
see the Nissan Infiniti and the Toyota Lexus in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deepening Affair 
</P>
<P>
To industry officials such as Garrett, automobiles and their pageants are as 
endemic to Southern California as sunshine and sushi. And, he says, the love 
affair is deepening. 
</P>
<P>
"We are predicting that between now and 1994, we will be seeing 50 to 60 new 
(auto manufacturers') nameplates," he said. "Many will be from nations we don't 
really associate with automobile manufacturing -- Yugoslavia, Spain, Australia 
and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"And where will they be hitting first? California."

DETROIT, L.A. SHOWS GO HEAD TO HEAD: AUTO PROMOTERS, START YOUR ENGINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Great Simonize War is under way. It is Motor City versus the Big Orange. 
Your father's Oldsmobile on Michigan Avenue against the kid's Porsche on PCH. 
It's a shoot-out between the 1989 auto shows of Los Angeles and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
And to the victor -- at least to Detroit's way of thinking -- will go world 
prestige and a city's reputation to stand alongside Geneva, Tokyo, Birmingham 
and Frankfurt on the international auto show circuit. 
</P>
<P>
"We are indeed going head to head with Los Angeles," said Pat Fitzgerald, a 
spokesman for the Detroit exhibition. "We are unabashed about our intention to 
become the national (auto) show and to expand into a Frankfurt or a Geneva." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Ambitions 
</P>
<P>
So unabashed, in fact, that the name of the show has been changed to reflect 
its international ambitions. This year, it is the North American International 
Auto Show. Last year, it was known a little more parochially as the Detroit 
Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
With even craftier calculation, Fitzgerald said, the dates of this year's show 
were moved forward (from the middle of January) to clash with Saturday's 
opening of the Los Angeles exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Fitzgerald said, Detroit's press conferences and product launches have 
been scheduled as far in advance of the show as possible "and with four or five 
(product) previews we should beat them (Los Angeles) by 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to make a lot of news here. We are going to publicly introduce 15 
new production cars, and more than a dozen concept cars are being shown for the 
first time anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
According to some planners of the Greater Los Angeles Show, however, such media 
manipulation smacks of a deception naughtier than rolling back odometers. 
</P>
<P>
They point to a recent issue of Automotive News (published in Detroit) and a 
photograph of the 1990 Chevrolet Lumina all-purpose vehicle. A caption noted 
the car will be introduced at the Detroit show. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no mention of the fact that the Lumina will also be at the Greater 
Los Angeles show, and that the unveilings will be concurrent," said Joseph 
Molina, public relations director of the Los Angeles show. "We have written 
Automotive News and clarified this point. 
</P>
<P>
"Detroit is somehow trying to achieve world status by using the media and 
mirrors." 
</P>
<P>
Then possibly the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show should fight fire with chrome 
and change its name to remove any folksiness from its image? 
</P>
<P>
"Unlikely," he said. "We don't feel any need to call ourselves the 
inter-galactic, all-knowing, all-seeing auto show. We're already a world 
event." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Garrett, executive vice president of the Greater Los Angeles Motor Car 
Dealers Assn., which endorses the Los Angeles Convention Center show, sees some 
Detroit panic in the new rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, all of a sudden, they (Detroit) are realizing that their importance as 
the national automotive capital is being eroded," Garrett said. "California is 
the nation's largest automotive market. We are a capital of the Pacific Rim. 
The design studios are here. The national headquarters of the Japanese 
manufacturers are in Southern California. New plants aren't being located in 
Michigan, but elsewhere and especially in the South. 
</P>
<P>
"The glitter of Detroit has gone." 
</P>
<P>
This week, with sides clearly drawn, the name-calling and casualties have 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casualties Mount Up 
</P>
<P>
Detroit may have more concept cars, Los Angeles said, but Detroit won't be 
displaying the Range Rover, or the latest cars from Daihatsu. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles might be staging as many press conferences, Detroit counters, but 
Los Angeles won't be visited by as many chief executive officers of major 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
It was a tempest in a crankcase begging for a tie break. 
</P>
<P>
And that may have occurred when it was learned that the North American 
International Automobile Show will open without two of the most prestigious 
vehicles on the North American and international automobile scenes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Rolls-Royce and Bentley will be exhibiting their cars at the Los Angeles 
show. 
</P>
<P>
"Detroit is not a place we consider fertile (sales) ground," a spokesman for 
Rolls-Royce and Bentley said. "The only shows that we support and regard as 
national shows are New York, Chicago and Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
The thinking, he explained, is patently bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States is the biggest single market we (Rolls-Royce) have got and 
we sell 42% of our production in the United States. Within that market, our 
best customer is California." 
</P>
<P>
Similar economic reasons guided Bitter. 
</P>
<P>
But there was another consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Said a show official: "C'mon, who thinks about buying convertibles in Detroit 
in January?" PAUL DEAN

1989: TRADITION REBORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, Times Fashion Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's time for the style-setters to strut their visionary skills, predicting 
trends for the year ahead. But those who usually prognosticate with ease aren't 
so certain this time. Especially not in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
After a year in which poufs, minis, status labels, high-price clothes and 
designer-dictators all bit the dust, no one's making book on what will happen 
next. Even clothing designers don't want to talk new clothes. Instead they talk 
of love, marriage, children, quality products, service with a smile, 
traditional values, handcrafted objects, spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, everything old seems new again. Especially to the 
thirty-something set, who are finally old enough to remember and compare. 
Instead of looking forward, they're looking back, in a fit of nostalgia for 
what George Bush calls a kinder, gentler time. 
</P>
<P>
They focus on home and heart, meat and potatoes, large families around big 
kitchen tables, sweater sets with pearls, sensible shoes, serious suits, 
continuity, integrity, security. 
</P>
<P>
Cocooning is too cute a word to describe their homing instinct, which is more 
like protective burrowing against . . . who knows what? Material things still 
matter, but they are not bought to impress. 
</P>
<P>
Here are predictions for '89 from some visionary types as gleaned by The Times' 
fashion team. 
</P>
<P>
Herb Fink, owner of Sonia Rykiel, Claude Montana and Theodore boutiques, 
Beverly Hills: "European designer clothes are not the future of fashion. The 
future is in less complicated clothes. Fashion is always a good indicator of 
the bigger picture, and in fashion right now, people are playing it safe. They 
ask to see something new, but when you show it to them they revert to what they 
know best. The most important buying trend is in home gadgets, because people 
are becoming homebodies. They're finding more things to keep them at home in 
more comfort. That's the new life style. Homes are everything. Money is spent 
on remodeling, enlarging, redecorating. General surroundings are really what's 
important today, more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Don Tronstein, Rodeo Drive property owner: "More people are more aware of 
whether they're getting their money's worth. The public wants service, quality, 
style and value -- in every price range. Low price or high price, they don't 
want to feel they're being ripped off. In the past few years, some great names 
have opened free-standing stores on Rodeo Drive: Chanel, Armani, Ralph Lauren/ 
Polo. They are doing magnificently. There's no mystery as to why. They offer 
style with quality and service, so people who can afford it shop there. You can 
analogize it to the major department stores. Nordstrom came out of the 
Northwest to Southern California, smashed all the other stores and expanded 
around the country with magnificent results. They combined service with quality 
in a certain price range. You don't have to be a big name like Chanel to 
succeed on Rodeo or anywhere else. You just have to offer value for the money. 
If you don't offer that, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Georgette Mosbacher, chief executive officer of La Prairie cosmetics and wife 
of Robert Mosbacher, newly appointed secretary of commerce: "What's oldest is 
what's going to be new. Replacing the opulence of the last several years will 
be a return to a more classic and understated style of dressing and 
entertaining. I think you'll see more satin pajamas and wide-legged pants a la 
Dietrich, more liquid gold gowns like they wore in the old Cary Grant movies. I 
think parties will be smaller, 10 to 12 people, definitely at home, with close 
friends. You'll find hostesses arranging their own fresh flowers and serving 
more simple food: a baked potato, any fish or fowl that's been broiled and 
Worcestershire sauce -- that's the sauce I'd like to see instead of French 
cream sauce -- and California wines. And for dessert, simple, fresh mixed 
berries with fresh raspberry sauce. Certainly, the Bushes reflect simple, quiet 
elegance; they're the epitome of that, but I also think it's the direction 
we're all going. It's a matter of change. It's time for a change." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Victor Costa, fashion designer: "Women won't be willing to spend a fortune on 
social dressing. I think the Bush family will lead the way, and it's going to 
be demode to spend thousands on a ball gown. I really feel it's a sanity 
factor. When you don't spend lots of money, you feel more sane. Ivana Trump 
sounded the trumpet when she said she was going to buy American and stop paying 
those haute couture prices." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Ozer, vice president, fashion merchandising and marketing, Associated 
Merchandising Corp.: "Coming up: Roller-coaster comedies from the '40s and 
'50s; one-man or one-woman shows. Specialty supper club acts. A revival of the 
Ed Sullivan format on TV. People will own a wardrobe of sunglasses; eyeglasses 
in general are back. Kitchen cocooning: meat loaf and mashed potatoes eaten in 
rooms that combine kitchen, dining room, back porch. The next collecting mania 
will be chairs, odd chairs instead of sets. Ballroom and vogue dancing are on 
the way in. Gray hair. It will be the year of the larger woman: ample sizing 
and ample clothes for ample figures. Birds are the new puppies. The whole focus 
will be the homey thing with musical instruments in the house and the antique 
piano as status symbol. In fashion: cameos, signature rings, rose diamonds, bar 
pins. Women's planned ensembles will take over, as in a jacket, coat and pants 
made to match. Square toes and Louis heels on shoes. Sweater sets. More 
citified sportswear, such as hacking jackets. In menswear, double vent and 
double-breasted jackets, velvet-collar coats. And ice cream sodas for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Eric Smith, creator of E.G. Smith socks: "Crafts are coming back. I'm glad to 
see us once again placing value on what humans can do rather than on what 
machines can do. It all goes with a revival of the 1960s, a nostalgia for the 
days when people were hand-dying and putting patches on their jeans. People 
will start doing fun things with accessories. That's the only area where they 
can express their individuality and creativity without emptying their 
pocketbooks at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Cole, shoe designer: "Traditionally, life style has reflected current 
fashion trends. That is reversing, so that fashion trends now reflect our life 
style. Soon the reversal will be complete. Clothes will be even more 
functional, more sensible, more practical. We've seen it happen already with 
more tailored kinds of shoes for women, more athletic and comfortable types of 
footwear. Of course there'll always be fashion and people who want to appear a 
bit different, a bit above and apart from the others." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Isaac Mizrahi, fashion designer: "Women will look for clothes with integrity. 
Not rubber, not stretch bodysuits, not midriff-halter things with a thousand 
buttons. I don't mean women will want boring, basic gray flannel suits. 
Integrity means anything that doesn't look available. A woman goes into Chanel 
because she knows it's not available to every woman in the world. It also comes 
with all this grand sort of culture attached to it; yet, at the same time, it's 
very new. That's what I think will sell. I really believe in exclusive things 
now. I can't stress that enough. In the '70s, every designer who could hired a 
big name photographer like Bruce Weber to do a huge ad campaign that bombarded 
women with their ill-fitting clothes. It was all about image. But fashion isn't 
based on hype anymore." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Kozberg, president of the Amazing Blue Ribbon of the Music Center and 
vice chair of the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee: "The city will really 
come of age in '89. It seemed for a long time that people considered things 
here to be temporary. Now, architecturally, there appears to be a growing sense 
of thoughtfulness and quality and permanence. There's also a realization and a 
sense of responsibility that we are on our way to becoming the most densely 
populated city in the United States. We're starting to take the future very 
seriously. On a more frivolous note, I personally hope that we can move beyond 
the colors aqua and peach in restaurants, hotel lobbies and strip shopping 
centers. And in 1989, we'll witness the demise of the miniskirt and the advent 
of loose, flowing pants. People won't mind carrying a few extra pounds." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Jim Klein, painter, singer/song writer: "We've reached the height of the 
costume era -- we've learned how to dress up our thoughts and our emotions and 
our world. And it's not working. All that frivolity is leading to destruction. 
In 1989, there will be a total environmental awareness because of the 
greenhouse effect. It's going to make the universe a universe for the first 
time, just by everyone asking the question: 'What do we do to avoid our 
extinction?' No one can point a finger anymore. You throw garbage in a stream 
in Montana and traces of it end up in Australia years later. It's going to 
force honesty upon mankind. There's no room for contrivance when it comes to 
survival." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Leon Max, fashion designer, Los Angeles: "L.A. is becoming more refined, more 
civilized. Living in the second largest and second most important city in the 
country, Los Angelenos are asserting themselves. With that comes a certain 
degree of pride, and trying to take full advantage of the life style L.A. 
offers. People are gardening, trying to perfect the flavor of their food, 
finding a better wine, furnishing their homes with a more sophisticated 
aesthetic. I don't have time to garden, but I take an aesthetic interest -- 
something I never did before. Los Angeles is still an architectural nightmare, 
but if one understands the location, you can drive from one oasis of culture to 
the next and keep your blinders on." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Van-Martin Rowe, architectural and interior designer: "I'm noticing an enormous 
upsurge in maternity clothes. It's as if everybody is pregnant. I'm seeing 
dining room tables that seat at least 10. It's the sense of the family. People 
are socializing more at home, asking friends and their kids over. I'm creating 
areas within the living room for children. The trend comes from a generation 
raised with psychological terms like " 'enrichment.' " 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Sheila O'Brien, director of public relations, Beverly Hills Hotel: "Everything 
seems to be speeded up, lightened up, including the amount of luggage and the 
changes of clothing. Guests don't seem to mind appearing more than once in the 
same attire. They're more casual, more informal. People want to come to the 
Polo Lounge in shorts, but we're not allowing it." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Bob Mackie, fashion designer: "Instead of designing kitschy clothes -- and I'm 
certainly guilty of that -- we'll be doing classics that could have been worn 
20 years ago and will look good 20 years from now. There's more of an ease. 
There are looser shapes instead of those little sausage dresses. And shoulder 
pads are all but gone." 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Allee Willis, artist/songwriter: "Nineteen eighty-nine will be the year of the 
real person. The reason someone like (singer) Tracy Chapman is so successful is 
that she has supreme talent and confidence, but they're presented in the body 
of an ordinary person who could live next door and have the same problems as 
everyone else. I'm also a defender of (sitcom) 'Roseanne.' It's a show with 
everything you don't usually get on TV: people expressing real sentiments, 
saying stuff that people actually say within the confines of their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Also in '89, more people will have the guts to break out of the tight career 
categories they're in. The significance of living in L.A. is that it's an 
easier environment in which to break those boundaries. If you're a writer, you 
don't have to be just a writer any more; you can also be a set designer, 
director, whatever. In a few years, the perception of 'a Hollywood career' will 
be totally different. 
</P>
<P>
"I think car phones will proliferate. They remove stress and trauma for people 
with involved Hollywood schedules. They're worth every penny they cost. I only 
use mine when I'm lost, late or desperate. I'm lost a lot because I drive a lot 
and the phone has taken all the fear out of it."

Charlie Fradin, screenwriter of the summer '89 release "Boris and Natasha": "In 
my circle, everybody's getting married. If they're not getting married they're 
settling down -- well, not settling down as much as settling in. I don't think 
it's the couch potato thing. People will stay home, but they'll be doing a lot 
of stuff, like entertaining more, because it's a safe haven. With no one 
knowing what's happening with the economy or the world situation, you make 
yourself a safe haven. I see lots of ottomans and comfortable seating. Nineteen 
eighty-nine is the year before 1990 and 10 years away from the year 2000, 
which, when I was a kid, seemed 100 million years away. So I think we'll just 
burrow and play it safe."

Josine Ianco-Starrels, chief curator of Long Beach Museum: "In the next few 
years, many artists will leave Los Angeles to find quieter, more contemplative 
lives. Many have already left to live in Cambria, Albuquerque and other spots. 
That's because the feeding frenzy is on in L.A. As we become a major art 
center, the buying and selling increases, the competition becomes more fierce. 
Artists suddenly find themselves in a status race, comparing themselves with 
their colleagues as if they were stockbrokers. Among those artists concerned 
only with their art, there's a desire to find a haven, a place away from the 
rat race."

Lynn Kienholz, founder and president of the California/International Arts 
Foundation: "More and more international museums are requesting exhibitions of 
California artists. I think this is an emerging trend. The arts are growing in 
L.A. and what's more important is that support for the arts is growing. People 
are not only buying art locally but they are monetarily supporting more 
projects than ever before."

Brooke Knapp, president of the Knapp group (private investment company) and 
record-setting aviator: "I notice a growing awareness of the importance of 
honesty and accountability in business transactions and in personal relations. 
And a trend toward concern for others, toward a more caring society where money 
is not the consummate value. We're seeing more women helping other women. Now 
that they feel comfortable with themselves as power sources within the business 
community, they're able to reach out and help others."

Edward Maeder, curator of costumes and textiles, Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art: "The use of the English language is going down the drain. I think it's 
tragic that people don't maintain vocabularies and a love of the language. Even 
newscasters don't use correct grammar. It stems from television and from having 
everything fed to us. We're also emerging on a new plateau of greed. I just 
read about a wedding in New York where $1 million were spent on flowers. Greed 
is blossoming, and society looks upon it as all right. But there is hope. 
There's a growing consciousness about our environment. People are fighting to 
save what's left."

Marshall Herskovitz, executive producer of "thirtysomething": "I'm seeing 
people of our generation, the baby boomers, distressed by their lack of 
connection to the forces of change in society. There's an active desire to 
rectify that situation, whether it be giving more money than they have in the 
past or making a greater commitment of time. We're coming out of our shells. I 
would like to believe you reach a point in life where you look around and 
become more aware of people who are needier than you."

WHO STAYS AWAY 
</P>
<P>
Although residents can be justly proud of the spectacular, new Performing Arts 
Center, a 59% majority reports it has not passed through its doors. Another 14% 
made it once, and 27% twice or more. So who's finding it easy to stay away? At 
least two-thirds of the following: men, younger people, those at the lower end 
of the education and income scales, north county residents, those for whom the 
performing arts are not important and who are not satisfied with cultural 
events in Orange County, folks who prefer pop music to high culture events or 
Broadway plays, and, most obviously, people who are not aware of what goes on 
or who are, simply, not interested. 
</P>
<P>
This question was asked: "In the last year, how many times have you attended 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center?" Here are the results:

TIME CONSTRAINTS HINDER ARTS CENTER 
</P>
<P>
What keeps county residents from attending the Performing Arts Center more 
often than they do? Time constraints are the biggest reason, cited by nearly 
half. Overpriced tickets, unawareness of Center offerings and a simple lack of 
interest are each cited by nearly identical proportions. 
</P>
<P>
Though lack of time is the main reason cited by almost all groups, people who 
did not attend the Center during the last year peg lack of interest and 
unawareness more often than those who attended at least once. And among those 
who did go at least once, one person in four found the ticket price a 
deterrent. Prices, of course, also keep low-income people away. 
</P>
<P>
This question was asked: "What is the main reason you did not go to more Arts 
Center performances?" Here are the results:

WEEKENDER: CABRILLO MUSEUM TOURS EXPLORE TIDE POOLS' MINIATURE WORLDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gerald Faris 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You don't need a guide to visit the extensive tide pools below the San Pedro 
bluffs that stretch from Cabrillo Beach to well beyond Point Fermin. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the pools are a natural formation of rocks and water harboring sea 
life, and they are readily accessible to everyone at low tide. 
</P>
<P>
But if you don't take advantage of the free weekend tide-pool field trips led 
by Cabrillo Marine Museum naturalists Jim Burcheri and George Van Doren, there 
are a few things about the area you may never know. 
</P>
<P>
For example: 
</P>
<P>
* Kelp, which is plentiful at the tide pools and floats atop the sea just 
offshore, is the fastest-growing plant in the world and can add 2 feet a day to 
its length. And it's a plant of many uses, turning up in such things as ice 
cream, makeup and medicine. "It's a fountain of plenty," said Van Doren. 
</P>
<P>
* Some rocks contain easily overlooked petrified vertebrae of gray whales that 
lived 10 to 12 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
* Those loose, oblong rocks that have holes in them aren't volcanic. Those 
holes, says Burcheri, were made by rock-boring clams. 
</P>
<P>
* The plentiful lumps of coal aren't signs that there is a coal mine nearby. 
Said Van Doren: "A cargo ship foundered back in the early 1900s. It carried 
coal (that has) been washing up ever since." 
</P>
<P>
* And nearly every time you take a step on a tide-pool rock, you're treading on 
tiny creatures that have attached themselves to it -- a shelled limpet or a 
barnacle that looks like the cone of a tiny volcano. "A lot of people will say 
they've been here many times, but they didn't realize what they're walking 
over," Van Doren said. 
</P>
<P>
Burcheri and Van Doren offer their 45-minute tide-pool explorations on Saturday 
and Sunday afternoons. While museum staffers have been taking people to the 
tide pools for years, regular trips were started last fall. Museum Program 
Director Larry Fukuhara said they quickly caught on, and most have drawn at 
least 50 people. 
</P>
<P>
A new series of tide-pool visits starts Saturday at 3:15 p.m. and continues 
through March 19, with tours beginning at the museum information booth. Times 
vary each weekend according to the tides; an exact schedule may be obtained by 
calling the museum. Children under 13 must be with an adult. 
</P>
<P>
The recommended dress, said Fukuhara, is warm clothing and shoes that will not 
slip on wet rocks -- preferably tennis shoes. Cameras are welcome, he said, but 
plastic bags or buckets are not, because the tide pools are part of a state 
marine refuge from which nothing may be removed. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give people a picture of what sea life is all about," says Van 
Doren. 
</P>
<P>
And in the process, visitors get a little information about Los Angeles Harbor 
as well as a talk on how to improve its ecology. That comes as the guides 
comment on the soft-drink cans, plastic and other debris that invariably washes 
up on the shore. "We try to get the message across that the ocean isn't the 
place to throw your trash," said Van Doren. 
</P>
<P>
This time of year, too, tide-pool explorers sometimes catch glimpses of 
migrating whales out at sea. 
</P>
<P>
The trips are definitely hands-on experiences. The naturalists point out 
spindly purple sea urchins at the bottom of shallow pools, pick up sea hares 
that resemble large snails without shells, and prompt sea anemones to close 
with a touch. "When your finger feels sticky, you're being stung, but its 
harmless," said Van Doren. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a high-density, high-diversity area, where you have a lot of things 
close together," said Burcheri, drawing imaginary lines around 2 square feet of 
rock. Within that small space, he said, are various kinds of barnacles, 
limpets, sea anemones and 8-plate chitons that look like crusty, segmented 
worms. 
</P>
<P>
But while the tours are hands-on, they're not intended to be splash-in, 
although that sometimes happens when people slip into pools in their eagerness 
to touch an animal. "Some of them get pretty wet," said Van Doren. 
</P>
<P>
Burcheri said the most frequently asked questions are what the various sea 
creatures eat -- most are vegetarian -- and what they do all day. 
</P>
<P>
"Just what do they do?" puzzled Burcheri. The answer is cling to their rocks or 
skitter around in the pools. Gerald Faris

SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;

<P>
SCHOOL HEADQUARTERS TO MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beset by declining enrollment and dwindling revenues, the South Bay Union High 
School District plans to close its central headquarters and move the staff to a 
converted warehouse on the Redondo Union High School campus. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Supt. Ed King said the district expects to lease the 11,000-square-foot, 
2-story headquarters building at Pacific Coast Highway and Vincent Street to 
the city of Redondo Beach, adding about $100,000 a year to the district's 
$16-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment dropped from a high of 7,200 students in the early 1970s to the 
current level of about 3,000. King said the downward trend should level out at 
2,500 students by 1992. The district closed one of its three campuses, Aviation 
High, in 1982, and has reduced its headquarters staff from 26 to 16 in the last 
three years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The downstairs portion of the headquarters has been rented to the city's 
Community Development Department since August. The city may move its 
engineering section to the second floor, King said. Terms of the rental deal 
must be approved by the City Council and school trustees, he said.

<P>
Ducommun President and Chief Executive Norman A. Barkeley has been elected 
chairman of the troubled aerospace firm. 
</P>
<P>
Barkeley succeeds Wallace W. Booth, 66, the firm's longtime chairman. Booth 
joined Ducommun as chief executive in 1977, and became chairman a year later. 
He remains on Ducommun's board. 
</P>
<P>
Barkeley, 58, joined Ducommun last July as Booth's heir apparent, following two 
presidents who left the firm in rapid succession. Before coming to Ducommun, 
Barkeley had been chairman and chief executive of Lear Siegler, a Santa Monica 
aerospace company acquired by an investment group two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Barkeley lends his "brand name reputation" in the aerospace industry to 
Ducommun, said Julian Menear, an aerospace analyst with Pershing &amp; Co. in 
New York. Even so, Barkeley's task won't be easy, Menear said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to convince customers that Ducommun can improve its service and offer 
competitive prices," Menear said. Barkeley wasn't available for comment 
Thursday. The Carson-based company, which has cut jobs and dismantled its 
electronics business to lower costs, expects to report a loss for 1988. DENISE

Bond prices closed mostly lower in dull trading Thursday, as investors awaited 
today's unemployment report. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond ended the day unchanged, with its 
yield at 9.08%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said volume was light as the bond market anticipated the release of 
U.S. jobless figures for December. 
</P>
<P>
"Government securities are marking time in anticipation of those numbers 
because they will give us a feel for what the December economy did and the 
probable direction for the Federal Reserve's credit policy," said Elizabeth 
Ginste Reiners of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Many analysts predict the new figures will show an increase of 225,000 to 
275,000 in non-farm jobs over November's figures. 
</P>
<P>
But many investors fear that the numbers will be stronger, said Mitchell Held 
of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. "If that happens, then there's the fear 
of the Fed tightening," he said.

NOW IN BLACK, S.D. OPERA'S READY FOR ARTISTIC BREAKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past several years, the saga of the San Diego Symphony has dominated 
the local classical music scene. From the orchestra's move to its new quarters 
in Symphony Hall, its financial crises and infamous canceled season, to its 
slow rehabilitation, the symphony has been at the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
Across town, the San Diego Opera has kept an amazingly low profile, especially 
contrasted with the careening symphony soap opera. Under the leadership of 
general director Ian Campbell, the company has not only become solvent, it has 
amassed a modest cash surplus. Over the last five years it has increased its 
audience size as well as its subscription base. But these achievements have 
come at a cost. 
</P>
<P>
While other companies have grown remarkably, San Diego Opera has been in a 
holding pattern for several years. In terms of programming, the company has 
limited its offerings to the most standard operatic fare. 
</P>
<P>
"We pulled in our horns for several years," said Campbell. "We had to 
</P>
<P>
compromise to some extent artistically by presenting certain operas that we 
knew would restore confidence in the company -- the Bohemes, Rigolettos and 
Toscas must be done." 
</P>
<P>
According to opera board president Esther Burnham, when Campbell was hired in 
1983, the board's major concerns were restoring the opera's audience base, 
which had declined in the early 1980s, and retiring the company's then 
unpublicized $750,000 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"The accumulated deficit had us all worried," Burnham said. "We penny-pinched 
to the bone." 
</P>
<P>
One of Campbell's first economies came in the 1985-86 season, when he reduced 
the number of major opera productions from six per season to four. Burnham 
pointed out that, in spite of those cut-backs, Campbell did introduce a recital 
series, which has remained a viable addition to the operas presented in Civic 
Theatre, and chamber operas performed at the Old Globe Theatre. The demise of 
the chamber opera project remains Campbell's major disappointment with the 
local opera audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The reluctance of San Diegans to attend chamber operas at the Old Globe came 
as a big shock," Campbell said. "I thought it was the right theater, and that 
the product we were doing was right." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell added that Peter Maxwell Davies' "The Lighthouse," the 1986 chamber 
opera, which was directed by the Old Globe's Jack O'Brien, was one of the 
company's finest artistic achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said he is pleased that San Diego Opera retired its debt in 1987 and 
now enjoys a cash surplus of $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
"In the top 15 American opera companies, we are the one with the largest cash 
surplus. That makes me happy in terms of stability, but the whole purpose of an 
opera company is to create interesting art." 
</P>
<P>
One sign of the company's doldrums is the drop in subscribers from last 
season's high of 8,300 to 8,000 this year. Although Campbell denied there is 
any significance in this modest decline, he did concede that it is time to 
start spending money to get the company going again. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell noted that his company's budget has barely grown from $3.6 million 
five years ago to the current season's $3.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
"When you hold a budget as stable as that, something starts to give 
eventually." 
</P>
<P>
One of the things that has "given" is San Diego's ranking among American opera 
companies. When Campbell's predecessor, former San Diego Opera general director 
Tito Capobianco, described the local company in 1977, his first season here, he 
ranked it among the top seven American companies. Today, Campbell said that San 
Diego ranks in the top 10 or 12, based on budget, quality of work and the 
number of international artists engaged. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, San Diego had a virtual monopoly on professional opera in 
Southern California. But, in recent years, spunky Long Beach Grand Opera has 
gained national attention by presenting such adventurous pieces as Ernst 
Krenek's "Jonny spielt auf" and Karol Szymanowski's "King Roger." 
</P>
<P>
In three short seasons, the Los Angeles Music Center Opera has emerged as the 
leading company in the area. This season's eight operas and a $12-million 
budget make it the fifth-largest opera company in the country. Its bold 
productions of 20th-Century landmarks, Janacek's "Katya Kabanova" and Berg's 
"Wozzeck," have given it international cachet. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell denied that his company had become complacent in the face of growth 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Every company has its own kind of marketplace and risks. San Diego Opera had 
to deal with some specific problems, and we took a very conscious decision to 
be financially viable. It was evident that there were stresses in other local 
arts organizations -- it was no secret to us that the symphony was going to 
have difficulties -- that might lead to difficulties in fund-raising. We made 
the decision to fill the house to survive a financially difficult period for 
the San Diego community." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell asserted, however, that San Diego Opera is ready to break out of the 
holding pattern of the last several years, and Burnham agreed that it would be 
a mistake to sit still after solving the company's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to get on -- we've overcome the sins of the past," said Campbell. 
"Our repertory choices in the future will be a lot more aggressive. Our new 
policy from 1990 onwards is that every season will include at least one 
20th-Century opera." 
</P>
<P>
While he was not ready to divulge the entire 1990 season, Campbell stated that 
it would include Francis Poulenc's "Les Dialogues des Carmelites," first 
performed in 1956. The opera will be a co-production with Houston Grand Opera, 
with sets built in San Diego's own scenic studio. San Diego's budget for the 
1990 season is projected at $4.2 million, and, if the production of "Boris 
Godunov" for the Soviet Arts Festival is included, the budget rises to $4.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell is lobbying his board to expand the 1991 season to five opera 
productions, which would give him even more freedom to program new and unusual 
repertory. 
</P>
<P>
"One of my ambitions is to open a season with a 20th-Century opera in the next 
few years, to make clear to everybody the statement that we believe in it," 
Campbell added. "The opera company that merely appeals to what the public wants 
is doomed to disaster eventually."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: THEATER / NANCY CHURNIN: CASSIUS CARTER'S 20TH YEAR BLOOMS 
WITH A LOVE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN

<TEXT>
<P>
The first play in the 20th year of the Cassius Carter Centre Stage is a love 
story, and it may be a hot one. 
</P>
<P>
Playwright Lanie Robertson expects several New York producers to check out his 
"Alfred Stieglitz Loves O'Keeffe" at the Carter for a possible on- or 
off-Broadway production. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe presentation, which opens Saturday, marks the third in five 
already scheduled regional productions of the play. The Globe is the only 
theater that has asked for script changes from Robertson. The playwright 
originally came out to see if doing the play in the round would require any 
rewriting. In the course of working with director Robert Berlinger and artistic 
director Jack O'Brien over the last three weeks, the three agreed that minor 
alterations might yield major thematic differences. 
</P>
<P>
"A writer has to be very protective of the script," Robertson said. "But I 
think they're terrific changes." 
</P>
<P>
Robertson, who has written 17 full-length plays and 21 one-acts in the 13 years 
since taking up playwrighting, drew his inspiration for the play in 1985 after 
seeing "A Portrait of Georgia O'Keeffe," a collection of 50 photographs that 
Alfred Stieglitz took of the painter in the 1920s. Robertson describes his work 
as "a love poem, a Valentine. . ." 
</P>
<P>
"My image is a heart carved on an oak tree, with 'Alfred Stieglitz Loves 
O'Keeffe' on the heart," he said. "D. H. Lawrence has a phrase about love 
called star equilibrium, that describes two people, each being attracting and 
repulsing at the same time, each remaining in their own orbit rather than 
overwhelming the other. I felt Stieglitz and O'Keeffe had star equilibrium for 
a very long time. In those photographs, one can sense an intangible essence 
passing between the model and the photographer -- it was such a whimsical and 
caring and careful collaboration between them. I felt there was some essence of 
their affection for each other that was quite exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Is this ideal relationship anything the 43-year-old Texas-born playwright has 
experienced first hand? 
</P>
<P>
"One searches for it," he said. "One always thinks, 'Maybe this time.' . . . 
But, sad to say, no, I haven't experienced it -- yet." 
</P>
<P>
The first productions of "Alfred Stieglitz Loves O'Keeffe" were in March at the 
GeVa Theatre in Rochester, N.Y., and at the Alaska Repertory Theatre in 
Anchorage in October. Next stops are the Alley Theatre in Houston and the 
Cricket Theatre in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe has been looking for a permanent all-purpose rehearsal and 
audition space ever since it converted the former Falstaff Tavern into the 
Cassius Carter Centre Stage in 1968. Still, the conversion is one no one 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
The Falstaff Tavern was originally used as a restaurant during the 1935 
California-Pacific Exposition and later converted into a multipurpose space. In 
1963, then-artistic director Craig Noel experimented with producing plays that 
wouldn't need to appeal to the larger audiences that the Old Globe was 
accustomed to serving. 
</P>
<P>
Noel produced 25 shows at the Falstaff Tavern before the space underwent the 
renovations that transformed it into the Cassius Carter, where it has since 
been host to 112 plays, beginning with Peter Ustinov's anti-war play, "The 
Unknown Soldier and His Wife." A. R. Gurney's first world premiere at the 
Globe, "Another Antigone," was stage there, and Stephen Metcalfe's "Vikings." 
Metcalfe, an associate artist of the Globe, has since been produced in each of 
the Globe's theaters ("The Incredibly Famous Willy Rivers" played on the main 
stage and "White Linen" at the Lowell Davies Festival Stage). His latest effort 
will soon be released, not on a stage, however, but at the movies: 
advertisements for "Cousins," Metcalfe's adaptation of the French film, "Cousin 
Cousine," have already reached local theaters. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds, who won the San Diego Critics Circle 
award for best actress last year, will appear in "Catch Me If You Can," playing 
Jan. 9-Feb. 18 at the Lawrence Welk Dinner Theatre. . . . Allison Brennan, who 
last wowed local audiences with her performance in "Hard Times" at the San 
Diego Repertory Theatre season before last, will replace Los Angeles actress 
Barbara Sohmers as the weary daughter of an elderly tall-tale-telling idealist 
in "I'm Not Rappaport," at the Hahn Cosmopolitan Theatre Jan. 18-Feb. 26. 
Sohmers bowed out when she landed television work. . . . Don't bother waiting 
for Steve Martin or Robin Williams at this one, but you can start "Waiting for 
Godot" at the Marquis Public Theatre in March. The choice of this play by 
Samuel Beckett continues in a line of thoughtful, and thus far effective 
classical choices at the Marquis that have included "Six Characters in Search 
of an Author," "Madwoman of Chaillot" and "Rashomon." The cast for "Rashomon" 
will go into rehearsal for "Godot" when that play closes Jan. 14. . . . "A 
Raisin in the Sun," Lorraine Hansberry's classic story about a black family 
torn apart by conflicting dreams of how to leave poverty behind, premieres with 
Esther Rolle and Danny Glover on American Playhouse on KPBS-TV (Channel 15) on 
Feb. 1 from 8-11 p.m. . . . Performance artist Rachel Rosenthal will present 
"Rachel's Brain" at Sushi Gallery on Feb. 3-4. . . . San Diego's homeless will 
be the headliners when director John Malpede of the Los Angeles Poverty 
Department returns to Sushi Gallery for the last weekend in February to 
organize them in a series of talent shows.

Two young women who posed for paintings shown in China's first major art 
exhibit of nudes have hired lawyers and threatened to sue the exhibit's 
sponsors because they failed to ask permission before "exposing the models' 
secrets." Beijing newspapers on Thursday quoted the unidentified models as 
saying that since the exhibit opened Dec. 22 at the China Art Gallery in the 
capital, their husbands have thrown them out of their homes and asked for 
divorces. The Legal Daily News reported that the models are asking for an 
apology and for financial compensation. The exhibit of nearly 140 paintings of 
nudes, ranging from portraits to abstracts, has drawn record crowds expected to 
surpass a total of 150,000 before it closes next week. The exhibit charged an 
unusually high admission price of 2 yuan (53 cents); the models were paid 2.10 
yuan (57 cents) per hour for posing. ALEENE MacMINN

SOVIET FESTIVAL ASIDE, S. D. WILL OFFER DIVERSITY IN '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With or without a mayoral proclamation, 1989 is shaping up to be a bountiful 
year for the visual arts in San Diego. The Soviet Arts Festival, scheduled for 
October and November, will undoubtedly get the heaviest dose of hype of any 
local art event this year. In terms of visual art offerings, however, the 
festival promises to be mostly bark and very little bite. 
</P>
<P>
The rich and diverse programming that has quietly slipped onto the books of 
local museums and galleries for the year attests to both the city's potential 
and its accomplishment much more convincingly than any of the spectacles 
planned by the mayor. Exhibitions organized by major institutions across the 
country will be stopping in San Diego for a spell this year and, more 
important, local art museums will be spreading their wealth as well. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art continues to lead the pack in this 
regard, this year initiating two touring exhibitions, beginning with the first 
comprehensive museum retrospective of the work of Vernon Fisher, a Texas-based 
artist known for his complex and often obtuse narrative works. After its La 
Jolla debut (Feb. 3-April 2), the show will travel to the Albright-Knox Gallery 
in Buffalo, New York, the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston and other 
distinguished venues. Later in the year, the museum will exhibit the work of 
designer Emilio Ambasz (June 9-Aug. 6). The show will explore Ambasz's 
contribution to architecture, industrial design and graphic arts, and will also 
be seen in Montreal and several other American cities. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Museum of Art, hardly a vigorous exporter of its creative 
products, will travel only one of its exhibitions this year, a retrospective of 
the Spanish Impressionist painter, Joaquin Sorolla (Sept. 16-Oct. 28), 
co-organized with the Institute of Modern Art in Valencia. The museum's 
schedule for the year, however, does reflect a more adventurous importing 
policy than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Its show, "Art For the Public: New Collaborations" (March 1-April 9), from the 
Dayton Art Institute, offers an educational perspective on the highly 
provocative arena of public art, through plans and models of seven projects 
throughout the country. The Bronx Museum of the Arts will be sending "Latin 
American Presence in the United States, 1920-1970" (May 22-July 16), which 
focuses on how the U.S. has acted as "stimulus, source, haven, receptor or 
locus" in the work of artists from Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's sporadic steps into contemporary art and art linked to other 
cultures touch on firmer ground this year with these two shows as well as an 
exhibition featuring the paintings of Li Huai. Trained in Beijing and now 
living in San Diego, Huai explores the experience of working in such disparate 
milieus in her show, "An Artist in Two Cultures" (June 10-July 23). 
</P>
<P>
With the demise of most of the city's serious contemporary galleries in the 
past few years, local artists have seen their home-based opportunities dwindle. 
Of the galleries that remain (or have newly opened), only the Dietrich Jenny 
Gallery maintains a strong and consistent commitment to local artists. This 
year the gallery will show work by Steven Criqui and Michael Cuddington (Jan. 
5-Feb. 4), Amanda Farber (Feb. 9-March 11), Ernest Silva (April 20-May 20) and 
Wick Alexander (May 25-June 24). 
</P>
<P>
Local artists will have a chance to respond directly to one another's work in 
Installation Gallery's new "Hothouse" program. Each month, a different artist 
will make his or her mark on an appointed section of the gallery, modifying the 
work of the previous month's creator and setting the stage for the next. The 
gallery will also spotlight the downtown art scene once again with its annual 
Artwalk (April 22-23), a weekend of open studios, galleries and special 
exhibitions. Sushi Gallery's annual "Streetseries" presentation of art in 
public spaces (Feb.10-March 11) promises to ignite the city as well, in its own 
surreptitious and subversive ways. 
</P>
<P>
Other stimulating experiences in store for the year include the "Rosenberg Era 
Art Project," a traveling show of historic and contemporary work along the 
themes of patriotism and the Rosenberg trial itself (at Installation and the La 
Jolla Museum Downtown, Sept. 8-Oct. 21), the Thomas Babeor Gallery's exhibition 
of work by the elusive Surrealist Joseph Cornell (March 17-April 16), and the 
San Diego State University Art Gallery's sponsorship of a site-specific 
collaboration by New York artists Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler (April 21-May 
24).

While the mayor's decision to bypass the city's natural links to Latino culture 
and concentrate its first international arts festival instead on the remote 
expressions of the Soviet Union generated a measurable amount of flak, that 
bond will not go unexplored this year. In addition to the SDMA's "Latin 
American Presence" exhibition, three promising shows are scheduled at four 
different venues. "Young Mexican Painters" will be shared between the Mesa 
College Art Gallery and Palomar College's Boehm Gallery (March 17-April 27), 
and will be accompanied by a symposium on Mexican and Chicano art. 
</P>
<P>
Sushi Gallery will organize a show of work by Hispanic women from Tijuana and 
San Diego (March 17-April 15), and the Centro Cultural de la Raza, which faces 
the challenge this year of sustaining its momentum through a change in 
leadership, will present a show of photographs by Latina women that was curated 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
If the efforts of a consortium of contemporary art venues -- LJMCA, UC San 
Diego's Mandeville Gallery, SDSU's Art Gallery, Installation, the Centro and 
Sushi -- materialize, a group of Soviet artists will be brought to San Diego as 
artists-in-residence in the fall. Then, perhaps, the Soviet Arts Festival will 
elicit as much vitality and energy as the city's arts institutions strive for 
all year, every year.

KKLQ CONTINUES TO LEAD PACK IN ARBITRON RADIO RATINGS WAR; KGB-FM SLIPS 
SLIGHTLY

The Top 40 format of KKLQ (Q106) is maintaining its position as the 
most-listened-to station in San Diego County, according to Arbitron ratings for 
the fall period released this week. 
</P>
<P>
KKLQ, which is simulcast on AM (600) and FM (106.5), posted a combined 9.5 
rating among listeners 12 years old and over. The rock 'n' roll format of 
perennial ratings power KGB-FM (101.5) was second with a 7.0, followed by the 
contemporary music and news of KFMB-FM (B100) with a 6.3, and the "light and 
easy" music of KJQY (103.7) and the news talk of KSDO-AM (1130) with identical 
6.2 ratings. 
</P>
<P>
The quarterly Arbitron numbers represent all of San Diego County, including the 
North County. The 12 and over ratings reflect the percentage of the listening 
audience that actually tuned into the station for at least a quarter hour 
between 6 a.m. and midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Most stations and advertising agencies discount the 12 and over numbers, 
because they prefer to aim for specific demographics. But the numbers do 
reflect the general size of the station's audience. 
</P>
<P>
KKLQ, which usually does well with younger audiences, also did well in the 
25-54 adults category. It tied B100 and the country music KSON-FM for first 
place in the key age group with a 7.2 rating. KGB was next with a 6.4. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased," Q106 program director Garry Wall said. "We're certainly 
not satisfied, but it's great to be No. 1. This is our fifth No. 1 (overall) in 
a row." 
</P>
<P>
KGB's rating is a small slip for the station, which tied Q106 in the spring 
with a 9.0 and fell to a 7.4 in the summer. KGB officials were bolstered by the 
recent results of another ratings service, the Birch book, which showed KGB in 
first overall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think most stations would like to be slipping as well as we are," KGB 
program director Ted Edwards said. "I think the 9.0 in the spring was an 
amazing number and probably a little high, and the 7.0 is probably a little 
low. Overall, it is a very competitive market." 
</P>
<P>
One of KGB's main competitors, XTRA-FM (91X), held relatively steady with a 5.1 
rating. XTRA-AM's (690) new news-talk format only managed a 1.0 rating. 
</P>
<P>
The "Lites Out" jazz of KIFM (98.1) slipped to a 2.9 rating, down from a 4.7 
the previous ratings period. The "soft, relaxing favorites" of KYXY-FM (96.5) 
went from a 5.4 to a 3.6. One of the largest gains in the market was posted by 
KPOP-AM (1360) and its hits of the '40s to '70s, which jumped from a 2.8 to 
4.3. KIFM, KPOP and KYXY all returned to ratings levels of earlier books, so 
the new numbers don't necessarily represent a trend.

GOVERNOR WON'T SEEK REELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
ACTION SETS OFF A SCRAMBLE FOR 1990 CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
California's political logjam was blown sky-high Thursday when Gov. George 
Deukmejian announced that he will not seek reelection in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Some politicians jumped in, some jumped out and others suddenly became coy in 
the maneuvering that began minutes after the governor's statement. 
</P>
<P>
Moving toward a race for governor were big-name Democrats like Atty. Gen. John 
Van de Kamp, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein and state Controller 
Gray Davis. Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy also is on the list of Democratic 
possibles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wilson Mentioned 
</P>
<P>
On the Republican side, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson would probably preempt the field 
-- if he chooses to run. But Wilson refused to comment Thursday. There was 
speculation about another big-name Republican, baseball commissioner Peter 
Ueberroth, but he too refused to say whether he might run. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates said he would definitely be interested 
in seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 1990. Moving away from the 
contest were the likes of Republican state Sen. Ken Maddy and former Rep. Ed 
Zschau. 
</P>
<P>
Crowded primaries in both parties are now expected in the 1990 gubernatorial 
race and that in turn will jumble races for other offices and could even affect 
one U.S. Senate contest. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have the stronger bench -- they hold all of the other constitutional 
offices except for treasurer -- and they viewed the Deukmejian announcement as 
helping them enormously. 
</P>
<P>
But one Republican, while acknowledging that his party has few big-name 
contenders, said, "Two years is an eternity in politics and anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley, who barely lost to Deukmejian in 1982 but was soundly beaten 
by him in 1986, apparently will not be a candidate for the job in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was any chance Bradley would run, top adviser and Deputy Mayor 
Mike Gage said, "No. And that's it." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, however, has already made it clear he is running. Although he 
declined Thursday to discuss his plans, his press secretary, Duane Peterson 
said: "Yes, he wants the job, but the governor's race is 22 months away and 
this is not the time to discuss strategy." 
</P>
<P>
An aide to McCarthy, who was on vacation, said, "The lieutenant governor has 
not made any decisions about his future plans." 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy lost in his bid to unseat Sen. Wilson last November. But soon after 
that he hired as his top aide Kim Cranston, son of the other California 
senator, Alan Cranston, one of the most powerful Democrats in the country. 
</P>
<P>
A close adviser to McCarthy said privately that was a signal that the 
lieutenant governor was not ruling out a race for higher office in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Since McCarthy is also up for reelection in 1990, his candidacy for governor 
would set off a rush of candidates for his job. 
</P>
<P>
The same thing will happen if Controller Davis, who has often expressed 
interest in being governor, decides to go for the top job. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said Thursday, "I am going to decide by Feb. 15 what I intend to do in 
1990, but I can tell you this: If I do run for governor it will be to stand up 
for the middle class, because nobody is doing that now." 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, Feinstein moved to make herself a candidate upon hearing of 
Deukmejian's decision. 
</P>
<P>
"His decision made the campaign for governor a wide-open race," she said. She 
added that she had immediately authorized an exploratory committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee will seriously be exploring the race," said Feinstein. "I will 
be making a formal announcement as to my intentions later this year." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein and McCarthy both have Northern California bases, while Van de Kamp 
and Davis are based in vote-rich Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Chief Gates, who has never run for elective office, told The 
Times last month that he would think about running if Deukmejian decided not to 
seek reelection. On Thursday, he said, "I will have to give it serious thought, 
because we need someone who can carry on the kinds of things Deukmejian has 
done, and I think I can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Two Republicans who could be formidable candidates, state Sen. Maddy and former 
Rep. Zschau, appeared to rule out a race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy said in a statement that he plans to run for reelection in 1990 and his 
consultant, Sal Russo, said: "We explored running for governor very seriously 
and Ken's decision not to do it is similar to the governor's. It's personal." 
</P>
<P>
Zschau, who nearly unseated Cranston in the 1986 U.S. Senate race, said: 
"People have talked to me about the governorship, but I have no plans to be a 
candidate. I am still planning to run for the Senate in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Wilson, who has been under pressure to consider succeeding Deukmejian, 
told aides Thursday he would not discuss the race and then left for a vacation 
in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
A formidable fund-raiser who was just reelected to his second Senate term, the 
former San Diego mayor has long wanted to be governor, and many Republican 
insiders believe he would be the toughest candidate for the Democrats to beat 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
But if he lost a race for governor it would make him vulnerable when his Senate 
seat is up again in 1994, and he and his wife, Gayle, are said to be very fond 
of living in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Another possible GOP candidate for governor in 1990 is former Long Beach Rep. 
Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
Lungren was Deukmejian's first choice for state treasurer but could not get 
confirmed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Asked Thursday if he would be interested in running for governor, Lungren said 
he had "an open mind and an open book. . . . I have no intention of making an 
early decision." 
</P>
<P>
If he ran for governor, Lungren would appeal to California's conservative 
Republicans because of his congressional voting record and staunch opposition 
to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth, who leaves his job as baseball commissioner in March, would only say 
Thursday that he plans to return to California to live. He did not rule out a 
candidacy for governor, saying that he would "explore all opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
If he chose to run, Ueberroth would attract a lot of interest from California 
corporate leaders who praised his handling of the 1984 Los Angeles Summer 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
One consultant said Thursday that Ueberroth represents a "Ronald Reagan-type of 
candidate -- somebody from central casting." 
</P>
<P>
The governorship is of added importance in 1990 because of the arcane business 
of reapportionment. This is the once-in-a-decade redrawing of district lines 
for the state Legislature, and congressional districts -- including four or 
five new congressional seats that will be alloted California under the upcoming 
census. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats are virtually certain to control the Legislature, which is 
responsible for passing a reapportionment plan. Republicans desperately hope 
for a GOP governor in the Statehouse to prevent a gerrymander. 
</P>
<P>
Once the dust begins to settle on the field of gubernatorial candidates, a 
whole new army of ambitious politicians will begin airing out their hopes to 
move up in the Sacramento pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like crack the whip. It starts today -- the ripple goes down the line 
for two years and we hear the crack in 1990," said one Democratic political 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
As the Republicans scrambled Thursday to deal with the fallout from 
Deukmejian's announcement, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) seemed to speak 
for them all when he said, "I am just stunned beyond words. I haven't the 
faintest idea which Republican can now emerge to take on a Democrat (in the 
governor's race). And it is especially important because of reapportionment."

and Kenneth Reich in Los Angeles contributed to this report.

'GOOD KILL' -- TAPES DEPICT AERIAL BATTLE 
</P>

"Good kill. Good kill. Good kill. Pilot ejected." 
</P>
<P>
With those words, two Navy F-14 pilots ended a tense, eight-minute encounter 
that sent two Libyan MIG-23 fighters into the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon on Thursday released cockpit tapes of the downing of the Libyan 
jets that reveal in gripping detail the two American pilots' efforts to evade 
the MIGs and their frustration at balky gear and missiles that went astray. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot him," one American flier says to the other as a Libyan jet flashes in 
front of him less than two miles away -- seconds after they had shot down the 
first MIG. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't got a tone," the other responds, referring to a growl emitted by a 
Sidewinder missile when it has locked onto a target. 
</P>
<P>
"Lock him up. Lock him up." 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot him. Fox 2," says another voice. Fox 2 refers to a Sidewinder 
heat-seeking missile. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't. I don't have a (expletive deleted) tone." 
</P>
<P>
The pilot finally gets his missile aimed and blasts his target. The fight is 
over and the planes turn north, back to the safety of the carrier deck. 
</P>
<P>
The cockpit tape offers only brief and barely decipherable video pictures, 
although it concludes with a stunning blur of images of the second Libyan plane 
dodging and weaving, trying to evade the pursuing F-14 at close range. One can 
see the MIG flashing across the F-14's nose as the U.S. pilot tries to get a 
bead on its tail. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction of the MIG is clear in the final moments of the videotape, 
shown in a puff of black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The 7 1/2-minute audio portion of the tape, while confusing in the final hectic 
moments of the aerial combat, reveals that the U.S. pilots were nervous about 
the Libyan jets nearly from the moment the MIG-23 "Floggers" left the Libyan 
coast, at 11:55 a.m. Wednesday local time (1:55 a.m. PST). 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pilots describe several evasive actions early in the encounter. Each 
time, the Libyans turn and pursue. After the second attempt to maneuver away 
from the MIG-23s, the F-14s go to "warning yellow, weapons hold," an early 
stage in the process of readying missiles for firing. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the Americans turn away from the MIGs. 
</P>
<P>
"Bogies have jinked back into me now, for the third time, noses on, at 35 
miles, angels 7," the lead pilot reports, according to a transcript of the tape 
prepared by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Angels 7 means the plane's altitude is 7,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
F-14s Try to Break Off 
</P>
<P>
As the MIGs approach to within 27 miles, the F-14s try again and again to break 
off, but every move is mirrored by the Libyans. 
</P>
<P>
Then after a fifth evasive maneuver: "Bogies have jinked back at me again for 
the fifth time. They're on my nose now, inside of 20 miles." 
</P>
<P>
The lead pilot has had enough. 
</P>
<P>
"Master arm on," he says, flipping a cockpit switch arming his missiles. 
"Master arm on. Centering up the T. Bogies have jinked back into me again. 
Sixteen miles. Centering the dot." 
</P>
<P>
The phrases "centering up the T" and "centering the dot" refer to jockeying the 
plane into missile launch position. 
</P>
<P>
When ready, the pilot calls "Fox 1" as he fires a Sparrow radar-guided missile 
and "Fox 2" when he fires a heat-seeking, short-range Sidewinder. 
</P>
<P>
"Fourteen miles. Fox 1. Fox 1." 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, Jesus," says the weapons officer seated in the back seat as that missile 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten miles. He's back on my nose. Fox 1 again," the pilot calls out. 
</P>
<P>
"Six miles. Six miles." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weapons Officer 
</P>
<P>
Then another voice, again apparently the weapons officer: "Tally two, tally 
two," meaning he's seen the two Libyans. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot: "Five miles. Four miles." 
</P>
<P>
The second F-14 flying as wingman then fires a Sparrow and the weapons officer 
in the lead F-14 reports to his pilot, "Okay, he's got a missile off." 
</P>
<P>
At this point, it becomes almost impossible to tell who is talking. The tape 
continues: 
</P>
<P>
"Good hit. Good hit on 1." 
</P>
<P>
"Roger that. Good kill. Good kill." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the other one." 
</P>
<P>
"Select Fox 2. Select Fox 2." 
</P>
<P>
"All right, Fox 2." 
</P>
<P>
"Those (expletive deleted) . . . " 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot him." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't got a tone." 
</P>
<P>
"Lock him up. Lock him up." 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot him. Fox 2." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't. I don't have a (expletive deleted) tone." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growling Missile 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the lead F-14 finally lines up behind the jinking MIG and hears 
his missile growl. He lets it fly. 
</P>
<P>
"Good kill. Good kill." 
</P>
<P>
"Good kill." 
</P>
<P>
"Pilot ejected." 
</P>
<P>
"Okay . . . let's head north. Head north." 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go down low, on the deck. Unload, 500 knots. Let's get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
"We're showing two good chutes in the air here." 
</P>
<P>
Then in a report back to the carrier: "Roger. Two Floggers. Two Floggers 
splashed. We're heading north." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
F-14s vs. MIGs: AN 8-MINUTE CHRONOLOGY 
</P>
<P>
1.11:55 a.m. Wednesday -- U.S. radar plane detects two Libyan MIG-23s taking 
off from Al Bumbah Air Base and approaching two U.S. F-14s from the carrier 
Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
11:57 -- F-14s aim weapons radar at Libyan jets, which keep closing at high 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
11:58 -- U.S. jets, in a series of five evasive maneuvers, dive from 20,000 
feet to 3,000 and change course sharply. MIGs follow and accelerate. 
</P>
<P>
12:01:20 -- Lead F-14 fires radar-guided Sparrow missile at one MIG 14 miles 
away. Twelve seconds later, it launches second Sparrow, at range of 12 miles. 
Both miss. 
</P>
<P>
2.12:01:45 -- The two U.S. planes split off in opposite directions. Both MIGs 
pursue second -14, the "wingman." 
</P>
<P>
3.12:01:57 -- Wingman fires Sparrow missile at second MIG at range of six 
miles, reports hit. First MIG turns away. 
</P>
<P>
4.12:02:36 -- Lead F-14, having circled around first MIG, fires Sidewinder 
heat-seeking missile into fleeing Libyan jet at range of 1 1/2 miles. Pilot 
sees plane go down and parachutes appear from both. 
</P>
<P>
12:03:02 -- F-14s turn northward toward carrier.

NAVY OFFICIAL, FIRM, LOBBYISTS MAY BE CHARGED

Federal prosecutors will ask a federal grand jury today to indict one Southern 
California defense contractor, a Navy official and two Pentagon lobbyists, 
sources told The Times, in what would be the first criminal charges to surface 
in connection with the massive Pentagon procurement scandal that rocked the 
defense establishment last year. 
</P>
<P>
The federal grand jury in Virginia is being asked to return charges of 
conspiracy, fraud and bribery against a division of Los Angeles-based Teledyne 
Co. and three of its management employees, law enforcement officials said. 
Teledyne officials refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Others May Be Charged 
</P>
<P>
In addition, prosecutors are said to be seeking similar charges against Stuart 
Berlin, a Navy procurement official, and defense consultants William L. Parkin 
of Alexandria, Va., and Fred H. Lackner of Woodland Hills for allegedly buying 
and selling confidential Pentagon procurement information on behalf of Teledyne 
Electronics in Newbury Park and Hazeltine Corp., a unit of Emerson Electric Co. 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Parkin's attorney, Gerald F. Treanor confirmed Thursday that he expects his 
client to be indicted today. Berlin's attorney could not be reached. And 
Lackner's attorney, who refused a plea bargain offer from the government last 
summer, maintained the innocence of his client. 
</P>
<P>
The matters said to be before the grand jury today cover only a handful of the 
dozens of Pentagon employees, consultants and contractors whose names have 
surfaced in the seven months since the U.S. Justice Department revealed its 
sweeping Operation Ill Wind investigation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Prominent Figures 
</P>
<P>
But investigators insisted privately on Thursday that the expected indictments 
-- which do not include several of the more prominent figures in the scandal -- 
are just the first of many charges they expect to file in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Henry Hudson declined to comment on what is before the grand jury. 
However, a spokesman noted: "The grand jury will wind up its work tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
Sources said Hazeltine Corp. and two of its current and former employees has 
reached a plea bargain agreement with prosecutors and would not be named in the 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment From Company 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hazeltine declined to comment on reports of a plea agreement. 
"The company continues to have no comment on that case," said the spokesman, 
Jim Orso. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson, who directed the far-reaching, two-year investigation involving the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and Naval Investigative Service (NIS), is 
scheduled to make a formal announcement of the grand jury's action at a press 
conference today. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation broke into the open in mid-June, when FBI agents served 
search warrants on more than 40 government officials, private consultants and 
military suppliers. The two-year investigation has been described as the 
broadest inquiry ever into fraud and bribery in the nation's 
$150-billion-a-year weapons-buying system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sees Deliberate Strategy 
</P>
<P>
The first round of charges deliberately does not include any of the highest 
ranking current or former officials suspected of involvement in the case, 
including former Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn R. Paisley, a source close to 
the investigation said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're trying to put the squeeze on the smaller players to get them to play, 
to get them to help us land the bigger players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Teledyne, the grand jury will be asked to consider charges 
against three of its employees, sources said. They are George Kaub, vice 
president of contracts at the electronics unit; Dale Schnittjer, vice president 
of finance at the same unit, and Eugene Sullivan, the former comptroller of the 
unit and now the assistant controller of Teledyne Ryan Electronics in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Employees Decline Comment 
</P>
<P>
According to an affidavit made public this week, all three knew the company was 
getting confidential Pentagon information through Parkin. All three employees 
declined to comment and referred calls to the company's public spokesman. The 
spokesman also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The first cases being taken to the grand jury for indictment shows how Hudson 
and his prosecutors have decided to fashion a case from the massive amount of 
detailed information gathered during the investigation, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of gathering evidence of all the illegal acts of an individual, a team 
of 70 NIS and FBI agents and 15 attorneys are reconstructing the means by which 
military hardware contracts were won. Future charges would come in clusters as 
prosecutors piece together the roles of Pentagon officials, consultants and 
defense contractors in alleged schemes to pay or accept bribes, rig bids and 
trade in confidential information, a source explained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Focus on Two Contracts 
</P>
<P>
The proposed indictment being taken to the grand jury today focuses on two 
contracts for military aircraft testing equipment, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
According to a variety of federal documents, Parkin was retained as a 
consultant by Teledyne Electronics to win one contract and by Hazeltine to win 
the other. In both cases, documents from the investigation show, Parkin turned 
to Lackner for help in gathering confidential Pentagon procurement information 
and strategy of use to both Hazeltine and Teledyne. 
</P>
<P>
Lackner reportedly received more than $20,000 from Parkin for information that 
he allegedly got from his long-time friend, Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
And according to affidavits made public this week, Lackner and Parkin pooled 
some of their fees and paid Berlin for his assistance. Lackner and Parkin have 
been friends for about 10 years; Lackner's friendship with Navy official Berlin 
is said to date back at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Denies Wrongdoing 
</P>
<P>
William Dougherty, Lackner's attorney, has denied any wrongdoing on the part of 
his client. "Mr. Lackner never gave a penny to Mr. Berlin," he said. "And he 
didn't get any information he shouldn't have." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Teledyne, the alleged efforts of Parkin and Lackner apparently 
were successful. In 1987 the Air Force negotiated a $24-million contract to buy 
hand-held devices that test electronic equipment in military planes. Court 
records made public this week show that wire-tapped conversations involving 
Berlin, Parkin and Lackner indicate Berlin was able to steer the contract to 
Teledyne and away from its only competitor, Tel Electronics of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sparks Competition 
</P>
<P>
The second contract for $150 million, for a similar device for Navy aircraft, 
sparked a competition between finalists Gould Inc. of Rolling Meadows, Ill., 
and Hazeltine Corp., of Greenlawn, N.Y. According to court documents, Parkin 
was retained by Hazeltine to help it get the contract. Parkin agreed to split 
evenly his $24,000 annual fee from the company with Lackner in exchange for 
"marketing intelligence" that Lackner is, again, believed to have gotten from 
Berlin. The final contract for the device has not yet been awarded.

GOVERNOR WON'T SEEK REELECTION; 
</P>
<P>
DEUKMEJIAN TO TURN FOCUS ON PRIVATE SECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Grinning happily, Gov. George Deukmejian announced Thursday that he will not 
run for a third term in 1990 and instead will look for "new challenges" in the 
more lucrative private sector. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor said he decided, among other things, that he could be 
more effective dealing with the Democratic-controlled Legislature in the next 
two years if he did not run for reelection. Pledging a special effort to 
"personally reach out" to legislative leaders, Deukmejian said he hopes they 
can cooperate to resolve pressing problems of transportation, health care, 
waste disposal and "restructuring" of the increasingly restrictive state budget 
process. 
</P>
<P>
He called it "a very large window of opportunity" for political bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Possible Burnout 
</P>
<P>
But there are growing indications that Deukmejian -- who will be 62 when his 
term expires and will have served 28 years in elective state office -- has 
become, in many respects, beaten down and burned out from constantly warring 
with the Legislature. And this played a major role in his decision, insiders 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
The governor himself acknowledged to reporters that his decision would have 
been "tougher" had Republicans controlled the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian made up his mind over the holidays -- at his home in Long Beach -- 
and then kept the decision to himself and his family until less than an hour 
before he walked into a packed press conference. Sporting a wide grin, he 
immediately told reporters: "I'd like to wish each of you a very happy new 
year. And I can tell you that 1989 and 1990 are both going to be very good 
years for me, because I've decided not to run for a third term. So, I'm 
expecting to enjoy these next two years very, very much." 
</P>
<P>
But later Deukmejian -- a devout sports fan -- used a football metaphor to 
emphasize that he does not intend to dog it the rest of his term: "I'm not 
going to ground the ball and wait for the clock to run out." 
</P>
<P>
Even the governor's closest advisers were not told of his decision until 
minutes before he announced it publicly. However, nobody was surprised. He 
clearly had been leaning in the direction of retiring. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's announcement immediately changed California's political chemistry 
and set off a wave of intense speculation about who might replace him as the 
1990 Republican gubernatorial nominee. The strongest candidate, most political 
professionals seemed to feel, would be U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson. But Wilson last 
year won reelection to a second six-year term and advisers have said he would 
be reluctant to wage another campaign so soon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth Mentioned 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth frequently has been talked about 
within Republican and corporate circles as a potentially strong "celebrity" 
candidate who would begin the race with high name identification. But Ueberroth 
has been silent about any political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
State Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who also has been mentioned 
as a potential candidate, seemed to take himself out of the competition by 
declaring after Deukmejian's announcement that he intends to run for reelection 
to the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The only Republican who has indicated he would like to run for governor if 
Deukmejian bowed out is Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's advisers have expressed confidence in recent weeks that the 
governor could have beaten the early Democratic front-runner, state Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp. They insisted that the former Los Angeles district 
attorney carries some of the same "liberal baggage" on law enforcement that 
Democratic presidential nominee Michael S. Dukakis did last year. 
</P>
<P>
But they also acknowledged that the possibility of losing a reelection race was 
one of the many factors in Deukmejian's decision. He was a young legislator in 
1966 when Democratic Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown ran for a third term and was 
beaten badly by Ronald Reagan. And this left a lasting impression on 
Deukmejian, associates said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, advisers said, Deukmejian has grown weary of campaigning and shuddered at 
the thought of another race -- the next one certain to be tougher than his 
landslide reelection victory over Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley in 1986. While 
stumping throughout California with George Bush in last year's presidential 
race, an aide recalled, "He'd look at the campaign schedule -- six, eight 
events a day -- and say, 'How does (Bush) do that? How does he survive?' He'd 
just shake his head." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Popular in Polls 
</P>
<P>
If Deukmejian had run and won -- and public opinion polls showed him to be 
still highly popular with voters -- he would have become only the second 
California governor to have been elected to three terms. And if he had served 
out his third term, he would have set a new record for longevity, because the 
other three-term governor, the legendary Earl Warren, left office two years 
after reelection to become chief justice of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't come to public office for the purpose of setting some record of 
longevity," Deukmejian said in his opening statement Thursday. "I came to 
public office to try to make California a safer place to live and to create 
more opportunities for all of the residents of our state." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "My decision was made easier by the satisfaction that we have 
accomplished much of our original agenda." He cited education reform, a 
strengthened economy, a good business climate, elimination of an inherited 
budget deficit, welfare reform, new prisons and the "appointment of hundreds of 
common-sense judges." 
</P>
<P>
Insiders said, however, that Deukmejian had difficulty coming up with a 
compelling agenda for a third term. 
</P>
<P>
"His feeling is he's accomplished what he set out to accomplish. Now, he feels 
it's time to let someone else accomplish what they want to accomplish," said 
Steven A. Merksamer, the governor's first-term chief-of-staff who remains one 
of his closest political advisers. 
</P>
<P>
But associates also said that Deukmejian, a man of modest means, was concerned 
about building a financial nest egg for his family. Deukmejian, who earns 
$85,000 as governor, said he has not decided what to do after leaving 
Sacramento. But, as a former state attorney general and governor, he clearly 
will have many options -- such as entering private law practice, becoming a 
corporate executive, joining corporate boards, or a combination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earning Power 
</P>
<P>
"I'd kind of like to move on to new challenges. And I think there will be some 
additional new challenges in the private sector," the governor told reporters. 
Deukmejian advisers have speculated that, with his prestige, experience and 
contacts, the governor could earn several hundred thousand dollars a year 
outside of government. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian insisted that he has no interest in joining the Bush Administration 
or serving on the U.S. Supreme Court. If he wanted to stay in public life, he 
said, he would run for reelection. "This is the best job as far as I'm 
concerned," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian dismissed a suggestion that his political position might now become 
weaker in the Legislature's eyes because he will be a short-timer, a "lame 
duck." Lawmakers still must come to him to get their bills signed into law, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
And although he intends to "reach out" more to the Legislature, he will not 
change his basic style, said the governor, who has been accused of stubbornness 
and being too remote. "You can't teach old dogs like me new tricks," Deukmejian 
observed, almost under his breath. 
</P>
<P>
Illustrative of his lukewarm relationship with the Legislature, Deukmejian's 
announcement of pending retirement drew these prepared comments from Democratic 
leaders: 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) -- "In many ways it is the 
state's loss that Gov. Deukmejian does not wish to be a part of policy-making 
any more. He has not been as horrible as we have sometimes painted him to be." 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles): "We wish him well in 
all his future endeavors." 
</P>
<P>
The two Democrats both added that they hope to work cooperatively with the 
governor in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deukmejian insisted during the press conference that "I've really 
enjoyed" being governor, people close to him have said there has been far less 
joy and more frustration during his second term. Contrasted to his first term 
-- a period of new challenge, victories and exhilaration -- Deukmejian in the 
last two years has taken a political pounding. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things in Deukmejian's second term, the Legislature rejected his 
nomination of Daniel E. Lungren to be state treasurer, voters turned down his 
ambitious transportation bond plan, he initially proposed a tax increase to 
balance the state's books and then backed off in anger and embarrassment, and 
state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig won the final round in a long 
battle over education funds by persuading voters to approve Proposition 98. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on Spending Options 
</P>
<P>
And looking at a possible third term, Deukmejian saw even more potential 
frustration with new voter-approved restrictions on a governor's spending 
options and Democrats in solid control of the Legislature. "They seemed to want 
to create a picture, a record, of my stewardship as being one who would be 
constantly denying funds to people," the governor lamented Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In short, much of the fun had gone out of the job, intimates said, and that was 
a big factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding not to run, Deukmejian said he rejected the arguments of most 
Republican leaders, including President Reagan, that without him in the race a 
Democrat is more likely to capture the governor's office -- a prospect 
particularly crucial in 1990 because congressional and legislative districts 
will be reapportioned in 1991. Deukmejian said that another candidate would be 
just as electable as himself -- "maybe" even more so -- because a "fresh face" 
would not have a record as governor for Democrats to shoot at. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Khachigian, a longtime Deukmejian adviser and friend, summed up the 
governor's frame of mind this way: "As Ecclesiastes says, 'For everything there 
is a season and a time to every purpose under the Heaven . . . a time to keep 
and a time to cast away.' "

PANEL OKS STRENGTHENING OF SCIENCE CURRICULUM 
</P>

<P>
A special committee of the state Board of Education on Thursday endorsed a new 
policy that scientists and educators hope will lead to more forthright 
classroom instruction about evolution and other politically sensitive 
scientific material. 
</P>
<P>
Christian fundamentalists had lobbied against the policy, saying it could cut 
off their ability to present a creationist view of human development in science 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy now moves to the full state board, which, after postponing 
action for months, is scheduled to make a decision next week. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides say this latest in a long series of clashes between creationists and 
scientists could have far-reaching implications for how science will be taught 
in the state's classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
And because the lucrative California textbook market is a driving force in the 
industry, the outcome of the debate is likely to influence how science texts 
across the country will address controversial material. If adopted by the full 
board, the policy will guide the board in its selection of science textbooks to 
be used in state elementary and middle schools through much of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig said the proposed revision in science 
teaching policy is part of a "nationwide effort to strengthen the quality of 
instruction" and improve the accuracy of textbooks that now deal confusingly or 
not at all with sensitive scientific subjects. 
</P>
<P>
The current dispute centers on revisions proposed by panels of scientists and 
educators to a long-standing board "anti-dogmatism" policy on science teaching. 
That policy, adopted in 1972 after an earlier battle mounted by creationists, 
calls for "conditional" language to be used in discussions on origins of life 
and the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Orange County-based Traditional Values 
Coalition, said the anti-dogmatism policy is "one of the good things" about 
state education policy because it opens "a small window" of opportunity for 
creationists to get their views into science classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
But many educators and scientists believe the policy is confusing and has led 
to a watering-down of the science curriculum. Scientists point out that, 
despite a state board effort to improve textbooks three years ago, some widely 
used books still avoid using the word "evolution," substituting less familiar 
and less precise terms such as "organic change." Critics also note that some 
widely accepted and tested scientific theories are misleadingly qualified with 
phrases such as "some scientists believe." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Some believe' is a wording that is unknown in science," said Kevin Padian, a 
UC Berkeley professor of paleontology and member of the state Board of 
Education's science curriculum committee. "(It) suggests that it is like a 
vote. . . . (But) science is not a matter of beliefs, it is a matter of 
evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Honig and other advocates of the new policy say that the ambiguity of the 
existing policy and the vague treatment evolution receives in textbooks has 
caused some teachers to avoid dealing with evolution altogether. In other 
cases, some science teachers are using the policy as a rationale for presenting 
creationism on an equal footing with evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, instruction about scientific theories, such as evolution, 
would be clearly distinguished and segregated from instruction about beliefs, 
such as religious views of creation. Only science should be taught in science 
classes, the policy says. Discussions of competing philosophies, religious 
beliefs and moral values should be dealt with in social studies courses, it 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Many mainstream Christian churches support that view and have had no major 
problem reconciling scientific theory about evolution with biblical teachings. 
The Catholic church, for example, in its schools has long taught evolution in 
its science classes and Bible studies in its religion classes. "The Bible is 
trying to define the relation between us and God, not . . . how things are 
related to one another, as science attempts to do," said Father John Wright, a 
professor of systematic theology at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon, who said his Traditional Values Coalition represents thousands of 
churches, said his group has lobbied and written letters to board members. He 
said after Thursday's session that the latest draft of the policy is improved, 
but his group still will push for language that permits alternative theories to 
evolution to be presented in the science classroom. 
</P>
<P>
The most common alternative is "creation science," a theory constructed by 
fundamentalists in recent years to rival evolution. Its principal premises, 
that the Earth may be only a few thousand years old and that man was created in 
his present form, have not been accepted by any major scientific organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Board member James Robinson, who said he had received hundreds of letters from 
both supporters and opponents of the policy, cited the controversy and argued 
Thursday that the 1972 anti-dogmatism policy should be left intact. 
</P>
<P>
But other board members supported the view of Honig and others that the policy 
is confusing and is not providing teachers and textbook publishers the support 
and guidance they need.

LAWMAKERS CONFIRM HAYES AS TREASURER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Heeding appeals to set partisanship aside, the Legislature voted overwhelmingly 
Thursday to confirm Auditor General Thomas W. Hayes as state treasurer, 
breaking a political stalemate that had kept the office vacant since August, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The vote was 34 to 0 in the Senate, where Rep. Daniel E. Lungren of Long Beach, 
Republican Gov. George Deukmejian's first choice for the job, was rejected 
early last year. In the Assembly, where some top Democrats had launched a 
partisan attack on Hayes, Deukmejian's nominee was confirmed by a vote of 65 to 
0. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, 42, will be sworn into office today, taking the place of Democrat Jesse 
M. Unruh, who had occupied the seat for more than a dozen years until his death 
almost 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Hayes told reporters that he was "delighted" by the outcome, 
adding: "I think the Legislature acted fairly. I was glad to see the bipartisan 
support." 
</P>
<P>
The confirmation was a victory for Deukmejian, who praised Hayes as "a man of 
great integrity." The support Hayes received in both houses, Deukmejian said, 
"represents a vote for fiscal integrity and responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Governor's Announcement 
</P>
<P>
The victory was overshadowed, however, by the governor's own announcement 
several hours later that he would not seek a third term. It also was muted by a 
sense that Deukmejian, unable to win confirmation for Republican Lungren, had 
no choice but to give in and accommodate the Legislature's Democratic majority 
by nominating a non-partisan individual such as Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has Hayes never run for office, he has never even belonged to a 
political party. He promised Deukmejian, however, that, if confirmed, he would 
register as a Republican and run for treasurer in 1990, forcing him to embark 
on an effort for which he has little experience. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes acknowledged that in an interview Thursday, but said he will move swiftly 
to put together a credible campaign organization and begin raising money so he 
can hold the seat for the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a financial manager, not a politician," Hayes said. "What voters are going 
to have is a choice between a financial manager with no political experience or 
a politician with no financial management experience. I feel confident they 
will pick a financial manager. After all, it's their money." 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen Brown, a member of the Los Angeles Board of Public Works and the 
sister of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., is among Democrats expected to run 
for the seat. Brown, an attorney, who has scheduled three fund-raisers in the 
next month, said she sees Hayes as "a technocrat" and herself as someone with a 
"corporate finance and public finance background." 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be an interesting contest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Acting Treasurer Elizabeth Whitney, who had hoped to block Hayes' confirmation 
so she could run for the office as an incumbent Democrat, issued a statement 
after the vote pledging to cooperate in a "smooth transition," but did not say 
whether she still intends to run for the office. 
</P>
<P>
In voting to confirm Hayes, Democrats in the Legislature made it clear the real 
political fight is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
"Be prepared for a very feisty campaign in 1990, Mr. Hayes," Sen. Art Torres 
(D-Los Angeles) cautioned Hayes before the vote on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, a soft-spoken professional who has carefully cultivated his non-partisan 
image, has worked for the Legislature for the last 10 years, directing a staff 
of auditors who investigate mismanagement and inefficiency in state departments 
and agencies. 
</P>
<P>
While his nomination at first was lauded by most lawmakers, more recently some 
influential Democrats began to worry that their support for his confirmation 
might imply an endorsement when he runs for the office in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In praising Hayes during Thursday's debate, Democrats such as Senate President 
Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Los Angeles were careful to draw that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
"We all have in one way or the other voted to confirm Mr. Hayes as our auditor 
general," Roberti said. "He has performed admirably in that role. I think he 
will perform very, very well in the position of treasurer. . . . We reserve 
every right to support our candidate in November." 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), who abstained from voting, said there 
is no way to separate the partisan politics from the question of Hayes' 
qualifications. "Have you ever tried to unscramble an egg?" Garamendi asked. 
</P>
<P>
In the Assembly, where Hayes was expected to face vocal opposition from some 
Democrats, Speaker Pro Tem Mike Roos of Los Angeles was the only legislator to 
speak against his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Roos praised Hayes as a "perfect technocrat," but then resurrected an old quote 
from Republican leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) in which Johnson described 
Deukmejian's choice as a "world-class bonehead decision." Many Republicans were 
caught off guard and angered by the governor's decision to appoint non-partisan 
Hayes rather than a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
Roos accused Assembly Republicans of "laying down and rolling over for the 
governor" by voting to confirm Hayes. Ultimately, Roos left the chamber before 
the vote was taken, telling a reporter later that "I felt the breath of the 
steam engine" pushing for Hayes' nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Republicans were still miffed by the governor's actions, they 
called for unity and asked that Hayes be considered on his merits. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want him good-looking and charming . . . or do you want someone who has 
the experience, the integrity and the ability to get the job done?" William P. 
Baker (R-Danville) asked. "Yes, it's a bonehead decision because he doesn't 
have the charm and wit of a (Sen.) Ken Maddy or the fund-raising ability of a 
Bill Baker. But I didn't name Hayes, the governor did."

2 SIKHS HANGED IN SLAYING OF INDIRA GANDHI

Two Sikhs were hanged this morning for the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister 
Indira Gandhi, whose death triggered a wave of separatist violence that 
continues to plague India. 
</P>
<P>
Kehar Singh, 54, and Satwant Singh, 30, were pronounced dead less than half an 
hour after they were taken from their tiny cells on death row and marched to 
the chilly, rain-soaked gallows at New Delhi's Tihar Central Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Two panels of five Supreme Court justices Thursday turned down last-minute 
appeals by Satwant Singh, the only assassin who survived, and Kehar Singh, 
convicted of helping plot the murder. 
</P>
<P>
Satwant Singh, a former bodyguard of Indira Gandhi, and Kehar Singh, a former 
government clerk, are not related. Like all Sikh men, they take the Singh name. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Appealed to Rajiv Gandhi 
</P>
<P>
Hours before the executions, human rights activists and opposition politicians 
appealed to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to spare the lives of the men convicted 
in his mother's death. There was no response. 
</P>
<P>
Indira Gandhi was gunned down Oct. 31, 1984, apparently in revenge for an army 
raid she had ordered five months earlier on the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the 
holiest Sikh shrine. More than 1,200 people were killed, most of them Sikhs, in 
the raid to rout Sikh militants from the temple. 
</P>
<P>
As Indira Gandhi lay dying, other guards opened fire, killing bodyguard Beant 
Singh and wounding Satwant Singh. 
</P>
<P>
Kehar Singh, Beant's uncle, was arrested a month later and charged with helping 
to plot the assassination, which caused anti-Sikh riots in northern India by 
members of the Hindu majority. 
</P>
<P>
Fearing that today's executions could trigger a new outbreak of communal 
violence, Indian authorities placed heavily armed security forces on maximum 
alert in the capital and the northern states of Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and 
Punjab, where Sikh militants have been waging a bloody, six-year-old campaign 
for independence.

4 DISSIDENT 'PATIENTS' MAY BE FREED; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET CHANGE SEEN IN MENTAL TREATMENT AS PUNISHMENT 
</P>

In what may mark a turning point in the Soviet Union's use of psychiatric 
facilities to punish dissent, Moscow's chief psychiatrist said Thursday that he 
has recommended the release of the last remaining patients detained for 
anti-Soviet activity. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Tikhonenko, the chief psychiatric physician for the Soviet capital, 
said in an interview with The Times that an official commission has examined 
four inmates of Moscow mental clinics Thursday and recommended their release. 
</P>
<P>
"The final conclusion of the commission is that these people do have mental 
problems, but their condition does not warrant their continued isolation and 
forced treatment," Tikhonenko said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he could not order the release of the inmates, which would be left to 
the courts that had ordered them confined. However, the confinement orders are 
based on professional recommendations, and it seemed likely that the four would 
soon be freed. 
</P>
<P>
Tikhonenko said he could not identify the inmates because of the pending legal 
questions. The four had been confined for violating Soviet penal code sections 
70 and 190, which prohibit anti-Soviet propaganda and dissemination of slander 
against the Soviet state, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The two sections were widely used in the past to justify jailing political and 
religious dissenters. The government last year asserted that there no longer 
were any prisoners in jail for violations of the code, leaving only those in 
mental institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organization, has said 
that the practice of confining dissidents in mental institutions has 
dramatically declined since 1987, with about 45 people being released from 
asylums. 
</P>
<P>
While Tikhonenko said he had no information about mental hospitals outside of 
Moscow, Vladimir F. Yegovov, head of the psychiatry department at the Soviet 
Ministry of Health, confirmed that similar "reviews" are now being conducted of 
confinement orders around the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we are now changing our views of psychiatry, we no longer think they 
should be kept in confinement," Yegovov said. "Remember, we are releasing sick 
people, not rehabilitated ones." 
</P>
<P>
Yegovov said that the "certain category of persons," his euphemism for patients 
held for anti-government activity, was "rather a small number." 
</P>
<P>
He said the government has established panels of "territorial psychiatrists" in 
all 180 administrative areas of the country to review and monitor the work of 
mental institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government issued a decree stipulating that a person's threat to 
himself and society -- in terms of violent behavior -- should be the sole 
criteria for forced confinement. According to Yegovov, an accused person may 
now have his own lawyer present at every stage of the confinement process and 
challenge the recommendations of government psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets still deny having used confinement to a mental institution as a 
means of punishing dissent. But Western estimates on the number of dissenters 
who are being held in such institutions range from 20 to 100. 
</P>
<P>
In an unprecedented move, the Soviets agreed last year to allow a delegation of 
American psychiatrists and human rights observers to visit Soviet mental 
institutions and examine patients for the purpose of "assessing new 
developments in psychiatric practice in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
The American group sent an advance team in November to prepare for the visit, 
which is now expected to take place in February. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet move comes at a time when the Kremlin is promoting the holding of a 
human rights conference in Moscow in 1991. President Reagan announced Wednesday 
that the United States has decided to attend the meeting if the Soviets 
continue the current trend toward progress in the human rights field. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Soviets decided to withdraw from the World Psychiatric Assn. when 
it appeared likely they would be expelled because of their abuses of psychiatry 
for political purposes. Last year, the Soviets said they wanted to be 
readmitted.

KREMLIN MOVES TO CLEAR NAMES OF STALIN PURGES

The Communist Party on Thursday urged mass rehabilitation of victims of the 
feared "troikas" -- the summary courts that carried out Josef Stalin's bloody 
purges. 
</P>
<P>
The party's policy-making Central Committee, saying progress depends on 
rectifying the past, recommended that top government bodies pass a law "to 
consider rehabilitated all citizens repressed by decisions of these organs." 
</P>
<P>
Such a recommendation from a top party body is certain to be approved by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear how many cases among the millions of people killed, imprisoned 
or exiled by Stalin would be affected by the action, which was announced on the 
evening TV news program "Vremya" and carried by the official Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
But it was apparent the party believes consideration of Stalin's repression is 
keeping the country from focusing on its future and that it is seeking quick 
resolution of as many cases as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The "troikas" were so named because they consisted of three local officials: 
the head of the secret police, the Communist Party leader and the prosecutor. 
Historians say they had the power to inflict death penalities, often without 
any reference to the Soviet penal code.

SHULTZ ASSAILS ARAFAT OVER WEST BANK 'INTIMIDATION'

<P>
Secretary of State George P. Shultz denounced Thursday as "intimidation that 
falls more into the terrorist category" PLO leader Yasser Arafat's broadcast 
suggestion that Palestinians who advocate a West Bank truce with Israel may be 
assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters on his way to Paris for a conference on chemical weapons, 
Shultz said Arafat's interview earlier this week on Radio Monte Carlo has added 
"a real problem" to the new U.S. dialogue with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that Palestinians who advocate accommodation with Israel might 
"face the bullets of their own people." It was an apparent reference to 
Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij's call Dec. 23 for a year-long cease-fire in the 
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Freij 
immediately withdrew his plan. 
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, Freij denied Thursday that he has been forced into hiding because 
of the implied threat. In a telephone interview with the Associated Press, he 
said that various news reports are groundless and that he has taken no extra 
security precautions. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in my office all day yesterday," Freij said. "Now, I'm still in the 
office. . . . Everything is normal." 
</P>
<P>
According to AP, Israeli soldiers rounded up youths and some shopkeepers and 
ordered them to paint over slogans threatening Freij. The slogans, signed by a 
radical PLO faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said 
"Shame on All the Traitors" and "The Fate of Freij Will Not Be Better Than That 
of Zafer Masri." Masri was the pro-Jordanian mayor of Nablus. He was slain 
March 2, 1986, after indications that he might play a role in the peace process 
with Israel. The PFLP claimed responsibility for his death. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz made it clear that he does not agree with Israeli assertions that the 
uprising, by itself, is a manifestation of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a difference between the uprising and terrorism," he said. "On the 
other hand, threats against people who attempt to move in a constructive or 
more peaceful manner are acts of intimidation that fall into the terrorist 
category." 
</P>
<P>
Arafat last month renounced terrorism in all forms, accepted two key U.N. 
resolutions on the Middle East and recognized Israel's right to exist. Those 
were conditions without which successive U.S. administrations would not speak 
with the PLO. Once a series of statements by Arafat in Geneva and Stockholm 
satisfied the Reagan Administration, it reversed U.S. policy of the last 13 
years and agreed to hold talks with the Palestinian organization. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz said it is unlikely that there will be another U.S.-PLO meeting before 
the Reagan Administration leaves office Jan. 20. Therefore, he said, it will be 
up to President-elect Bush to decide if the dialogue will continue.

SOVIETS ACCUSE U.S. OF 'STATE TERRORISM, ADVENTURISM'

<P>
In one of the harshest criticisms of U.S. policy in recent months, the Soviet 
Union on Thursday accused the Reagan Administration of "political adventurism 
and state terrorism" for having shot down two Libyan warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
Official statements also warned the United States against escalating the 
conflict with Libya, especially by making any attack on a purported chemical 
weapons factory at Rabta, 40 miles southwest of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Foreign Ministry denied reports that the government of Col. Moammar 
Kadafi has requested that Soviet warships come to Libya's assistance, and the 
ministry would not speculate on how it would greet such a request. 
</P>
<P>
An official said only that the Soviet fleet in the Mediterranean is "in its 
usual location." 
</P>
<P>
Washington maintains that the two Libyan aircraft shot down Wednesday were 
showing hostile intent toward two American warplanes that were operating off 
the carrier John F. Kennedy in international waters a considerable distance 
from the Libyan coast. 
</P>
<P>
By their remarks Thursday, the Soviets appeared to be serving notice on 
Washington that the generally warm Soviet-American climate of recent months 
would not prevent the Kremlin from raising serious objections to U.S. policy 
when it touches on issues close to Moscow and its allies. The Kadafi government 
has had a close relationship with Moscow since Kadafi seized power in 1969, and 
virtually all of Libya's military equipment is Soviet-supplied. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters that his 
government received with "indignation and regret" the reports of the American 
clash with the Libyan warplanes. 
</P>
<P>
"Such actions, which are a show of political adventurism and state terrorism, 
can produce very serious consequences," Gerasimov said. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot agree that the United States, which is a permanent member of the 
U.N. Security Council, usurps the right to pass sentence on this or that 
sovereign state, in this case Libya," he said. "Irrespective of pretexts, the 
use of force contradicts international law and runs counter to the efforts of 
the world community to find political solutions to existing conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
The use of the phrase "state terrorism" seemed particularly pointed since the 
Reagan Administration has used the same words about the Kadafi regime because 
of its support for groups such as the Palestinian terrorist organization run by 
Abu Nidal. 
</P>
<P>
In agreeing to hold a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization last 
month, the State Department stressed that PLO leader Yasser Arafat had met one 
of Washington's conditions for talks by publicly renouncing terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
Gerasimov said the Soviet Union is in favor of a "calm situation in the 
southern Mediterranean," but he refused to be drawn out on what action the 
Soviets might take if the United States escalates the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Vdovin, head of the Libyan department at the Soviet Foreign Ministry, 
who also took part in the news conference, said the Kremlin has no concrete 
information suggesting that the United States plans any new action against 
Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
"Should such an act take place, it would be a severe blow against the overall 
political situation in the world," Vdovin said. "It would complicate the work 
aimed at ameliorating the situation, and we hope the United States 
Administration will give serious consideration to that fact." 
</P>
<P>
The Libyans buy about $600 million worth of weapons from the Soviets each year 
but have reportedly slipped into arrears on their military debts in recent 
months because of the falling price of oil. Although Libya is not a 
Communiststate, its government supports the Soviet Union on many world issues, 
particularly those of concern to the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
While the Libyans and Soviets enjoy extremely cordial relations, there was no 
suggestion that the Soviet Union would reverse or even restrict the recent 
improvements in relations with the United States because of U.S. threats 
against Libya. The Soviet-American relationship is regarded as a question of 
strategic policy, while the Libyan question is a regional issue. 
</P>
<P>
Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, took a relatively restrained line on the 
confrontation, accusing the United States of a campaign of "blackmail and 
pressure against sovereign Libya." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have seemed particularly concerned about a possible American air 
strike on the Libyan chemical plant. Washington contends that the complex is 
intended to produce chemical weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kontsevich, deputy chief of the Soviet 
Union's chemical warfare unit, told a news conference in Moscow that he does 
not believe that Libya has the industrial capability to make sufficient 
chemical weapons for warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Kontsevich said any country with a sophisticated chemical laboratory could make 
a few pounds of chemical weapons, "but that is not enough for conducting 
warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Kontsevich supported the Libyan view that the plant was designed to produce 
medicine. The United States has described the facility as one of the largest 
chemical weapons plants in the Third World, capable of manufacturing both 
mustard gas and a nerve agent. U.S. officials have also expressed concern that 
Libya could supply such weapons to terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
At the same news conference, called to discuss a five-day meeting on chemical 
weapons that begins Saturday in Paris, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official said 
his government had made a mistake in not agreeing with the United States to ban 
poison gas 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the cessation of the production of chemical weapons in the United 
States was a positive act," said Nikolai Smedovich, the Foreign Ministry's top 
expert on chemical weapons. "The Soviet Union made a mistake not to use that 
step."

<P>
And the outcome, destruction of the two Libyan jets without U.S. losses, points 
up the importance of intensive pilot training and the highly flexible tactics 
that American pilots are allowed to use, experts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The downing of the Libyan jets was conducted by "relatively senior, 
extraordinarily experienced officers," according to Pentagon spokesman Dan 
Howard. The pilots and their back-seat radarmen, probably in their mid-30s, 
used a variety of tactics -- attempting first to scare off, then divide and 
conquer the Libyans. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a classic contrast between American and Soviet-style tactics," said 
Benjamin S. Lambeth, a specialist in tactical air power at the Santa 
Monica-based RAND Corp. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Welded Wing' Approach 
</P>
<P>
"The outcome here was driven by tactics and proficiency," which pitted an 
inflexible brand of Soviet-style aerial combat -- sometimes derisively called 
the "welded wing" approach -- against a pair of American warplanes flying in 
loose coordination with one another. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Libyan pilots' moves were dictated by military controllers on the 
ground, Pentagon officials said. By contrast, Howard said, the F-14 Tomcats, 
guided only by their "rules of engagement," acted virtually autonomously. About 
70 miles away, air warfare coordinators aboard the carrier Kennedy listened in 
on the radio exchanges among the pilots and their principal outside sources of 
information, an E-2C Hawkeye airborne radar-warning plane, but the coordinators 
did not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Eight minutes and two seconds after the Libyan MIG-23s, dubbed Floggers in 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization jargon, were spotted taking off, the 
engagement was over. In the words of one of the American pilots: "Two Floggers 
splashed. We're heading north." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hostile by Origin' 
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the Navy Tomcats were clearly operating under rules of 
engagement that did not require pilots to have a potential adversary within 
visual sight before firing. Instead, the planes could have been considered 
"hostile by origin" -- a Libyan military air base -- or "hostile by action." 
</P>
<P>
The dramatic transcript of the American airmen's conversations during the clash 
shows that the U.S. pilots believed that the Libyan jets, dubbed "bogies" in 
cockpit argot, demonstrated their hostility by pointing directly at the 
American jets, or keeping their "noses on," as the U.S. pilots tried to 
maneuver out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Within the Tomcats' cockpits, the persistent Libyan countermoves were perceived 
as an effort to keep the American warplanes within the sights of the Floggers' 
firing mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
While still 12 miles away in the cloudy skies over the Mediterranean, the 
"lead" F-14, whose pilot calls the plays for his "section" of two aircraft, 
fired a pair of radar-guided Sparrow missiles at the Libyans, missing them. 
</P>
<P>
"Aw, Jesus," exclaimed the weapons officer of the lead Tomcat. 
</P>
<P>
But as the four planes bore down on each other to within six miles, the Navy 
aviators split apart in a much-practiced maneuver called the "drag." The tactic 
is designed to force opposing aircraft to commit themselves in one direction or 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. The Libyan jets responded as intelligence briefers have long said 
they would: The lead Libyan fighter and his "wingman," flying together in what 
experts call the "welded wing" formation, turned on the American "wingman." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits of Surprise 
</P>
<P>
While the tight pairing of planes may concentrate an attack, Western tacticians 
believe that American planes, often flying miles apart but in "mutual support," 
can reap the benefits of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
While the Libyan MIGs adjusted course to head straight for the wingman Tomcat, 
the lead F-14, now a "free fighter," could engage the Libyan jets from a new 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
Within 2 miles of each other, the American wingman called "Tally Two, Tally 
Two," announcing that he had sighted the two Libyan jets coming toward him. 
Targeting the lead MIG fighter, this Tomcat fired off a Sparrow missile, which 
hit its mark seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got the other one," said the lead Navy pilot, as the Libyan wingman, in 
what many experts called a fatal mistake, turned tail. The about-face brought 
the lead Tomcat into an ideal position, and just within range, to use his 
Sidewinder heat-seeking missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Twice the Sidewinder failed to make the growling tone that indicates that it 
has found its target. But as the lead pilot swung behind the fleeing craft, it 
took what pilots call a "hot side shot," sending the second MIG into the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
"The Libyan track record is not very good in their use of their aircraft," said 
Howard, who added that "in the past, they've had the prudence . . . to go home 
when we've made some indication that we don't want them to come out and visit 
our ships."

A judge has ordered the state Department of Forestry to hire outside lawyers to 
defend it against an environmental group's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Humboldt County Superior Court Judge John E. Buffington made his ruling after 
deciding that Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp's office "cannot . . . carry out its 
duty to assure that the environment of this state is protected." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling grew out of a lawsuit in which environmentalists are challenging the 
harvest of some of the world's last privately owned virgin redwood forests, 
despite warnings by the state Department of Fish and Game that logging would 
threaten endangered species and degrade the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"The public could easily conclude that the attorney general is overlooking some 
legitimate environmental issues while adopting a position which favors a large 
corporation's business concern," Buffington wrote.

GROUP SEEKS TO AIM ANTI-SMOKING DRIVE AT CHILDREN

Reasoning that the best way to break the smoking habit is to stop it before it 
begins, sponsors of the successful tobacco tax initiative Proposition 99 said 
Thursday they want to focus their anti-smoking education campaign on school-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to teach every child about the hazards of smoking," said Dr. W. James 
Nethery, chairman of Coalition for a Healthy California. He added that "90% of 
all smokers start by the age of 19, and 60% begin by the age of 14." 
</P>
<P>
Key members of the coalition are the American Lung Assn., the American Cancer 
Society, the American Heart Assn., the Planning and Conservation League and the 
California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 99 imposed a 25-cent-a-pack tax increase on cigarettes and placed 
comparable tax hikes on cigars and other tobacco products. The roughly $650 
million a year raised by the new taxes will go into anti-smoking education 
campaigns, health care, cancer research and enhancement of natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
The anti-smoking education campaign is part of a proposed five-part legislative 
program to implement the initiative that was unveiled here and in Los Angeles 
on Thursday by Proposition 99 sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Nethery and others said they are bracing for what they think may be a battle 
over the money because state funds are being stretched to the limit by another 
November ballot initiative, Proposition 98, the school funding measure. 
</P>
<P>
David Langness, an official of the American Heart Assn. in Los Angeles, said: 
"This is the first major new source of revenue for government since the passage 
of Proposition 13 (the property-tax cut measure) in 1979. The barracuda will be 
out." 
</P>
<P>
The plan put forward by the Proposition 99 coalition envisions that the $650 
million in new revenues would be split this way: $292.5 million would go to 
hospitals and doctors to defray medical treatment costs for those not covered 
by public or private insurance; $130 million would go into an education fund; 
$32.5 million for research on a cure for lung cancer, heart disease and other 
tobacco-related illnesses and $32.5 million into a natural resources account 
for park and wildlife enhancement projects. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining money, roughly $162.5 million, would go into a general account 
that would be distributed to various unspecified programs that would be 
approved by a special committee. 
</P>
<P>
As for the education fund, sponsors of Proposition 99 said they want 
legislation that will earmark 70% of all the money for programs aimed at 
school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
School districts would be eligible to apply for the Proposition 99 money, but 
so would community clinics, volunteer health agencies, local health departments 
and hospitals and community clinics.

GOVERNOR: THE RACE IS ON; 
</P>
<P>
DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHN K. VAN DE KAMP -- California's two-term attorney general and front-runner 
of the Democratic Establishment, Van de Kamp, 52, decided long before 
Deukmejian's decision to seek the governorship next election no matter who the 
GOP candidate was. He already has a blue-ribbon campaign staff. The namesake of 
the Los Angeles bakery family and resident of Pasadena, Van de Kamp was 
previously Los Angeles County district attorney, first appointed in 1975 and 
serving until 1982. A philosophical moderate, he is viewed as strong where 
Democrats have been weak -- on crime. On the other hand, he has a reputation as 
a lackluster campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
GRAY DAVIS -- A relentless fund-raiser and cagey tactician, state Controller 
Davis, 46, has eyed the governorship for most of his adult life. He worked his 
way up from being an assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley to chief of 
staff to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., 1974-81, to a state assemblyman from 
the Westside of Los Angeles, 1982-86, and controller. He has to decide if this 
is the time to risk his office. A liberal with an image as a "new breed" 
Democrat, Davis is media-wise and energetic. Some find him too much so, and say 
that for all his political ambition, he lacks a driving policy agenda. 
</P>
<P>
DIANNE FEINSTEIN -- In the regional politics of California, Feinstein, 55, can 
claim a strong base in the Bay Area. She served two terms as mayor of San 
Francisco, from November, 1978, when incumbent George Moscone was assassinated, 
through 1988. Before that, she served nine years as a San Francisco County 
supervisor and twice was defeated for mayor. Her mayoralty brought growth to 
San Francisco and she was mentioned as Walter F. Mondale's second choice for a 
vice presidential running mate in 1984. She is attractive and skilled on 
television, but even her strongest backers question whether she has the "fire 
in the belly." 
</P>
<P>
LEO T. McCARTHY -- California's lieutenant governor just lost a statewide race 
for the U.S. Senate last year. But the governorship has been a burning ambition 
of his all along, and some think defeat did not douse all of his drive. At 58, 
he is strong in his hometown of San Francisco -- where his base rivals 
Feinstein's -- and worked hard trying to become known and organized in Southern 
California. He was elected lieutenant governor in 1982 and again in 1986. 
Before that he served in the state Assembly from 1968 through 1982, including 
six years as Assembly Speaker. He is a lifelong liberal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REPUBLICANS 
</P>
<P>
PETE WILSON -- At 55, Wilson suddenly is unrivaled as tomorrow's leader of the 
California GOP. Just elected to his second term in the U.S. Senate, this 
seasoned but cautious politician is now being asked by some desperate party 
leaders to look west again and help the GOP keep the Statehouse. In fact, being 
governor was Wilson's first ambition. He ran and lost in the 1978 GOP primary. 
He ran again in 1982, but party leaders, ironically, urged him to seek the 
Senate. He is a former mayor and state assemblyman from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
DAN LUNGREN -- It is a measure of the GOP's weak "bench" that Lungren, 42, 
would be considered in the first-rank of gubernatorial contenders. A 
conservative, he was elected to Congress from Long Beach in 1978 and served 
through last year. Gov. Deukmejian appointed him state treasurer but he was 
rejected by the Democratic-controlled Senate in February, 1988, a decision 
upheld by the state Supreme Court. Since then he has been taking stock of his 
options. 
</P>
<P>
DARYL F. GATES -- A career policeman, Gates, 62, joined the LAPD in 1949. He 
was made assistant chief in 1969 and chief in 1978. Late last year, he said he 
would be interested in running if Deukmejian decided not to seek reelection. He 
is one of the party's more colorful characters, is close to President-elect 
Bush and has been mentioned lately as a possible pick for drug czar in the Bush 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
PETER UEBERROTH -- At 51, the retiring commissioner of baseball is standoffish 
but has done nothing to quell speculation about his political ambitions. He is 
the hands-down favorite of those who think only a celebrity candidate can save 
the GOP in Sacramento. A registered Republican, little is known of Ueberroth's 
political views. He has been commissioner of baseball since 1984 and was Time 
magazine's Man of the Year in 1984. He ran the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing 
Committee before that, proving that the Games can be run at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NOT RUNNING, BUT . . . 
</P>
<P>
KEN MADDY -- This 54-year-old Fresno-based politician is handsome and affable, 
and some think his announcement that he will not run for governor could be 
turned around with some coaxing. He is Republican leader of the state Senate. 
He was first elected to the Legislature in 1970, serving first in the Assembly, 
and then won a special election to the Senate in 1979. He ran for governor in 
1978 and lost in the primary. He has a strong base in agribusiness and family 
wealth which could prove a big asset under California's newly tightened 
campaign finance laws. He has a reputation as a moderate.

After listening to pleas from paid tobacco industry lobbyists and smokers 
Thursday, the San Diego Stadium Authority backed off on a proposed smoking ban 
in all stadium seating areas in favor of merely asking smokers to be respectful 
of nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a compromise, a sign will be erected on the Jack Murphy Stadium 
scoreboard that will read: "The Stadium Authority requests if you smoke please 
be considerate of your neighbor."

The wording was worked out in committee meetings with officials of the San

THOMPSON LIKES WAY HOYAS ARE SHAPING UP 
</P>

Georgetown Coach John Thompson says all Big East Conference games "matter" and 
"any time you're into league play it's important to get a good start, not just 
in the first game but the first few games." But he also freely admits: "We 
haven't always been able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it should not come as a great surprise that the fifth-ranked Hoyas lost 
to 10th-ranked Seton Hall, 94-86, Tuesday night in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The game was played before 19,761 fans, the largest crowd to see a college 
basketball game in New Jersey and the largest crowd for a Big East game played 
at a site other than the Carrier Dome in Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
The Pirates, who improved their overall record to 13-0 and reached 2-0 in Big 
East play for the first time, had five players with 12 or more points, led by 
senior forward Daryll Walker (20 points, career-best 17 rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
Senior swingman Jaren Jackson led the Hoyas (9-1, 0-1) with a game-high 27 
points. Freshman center Alonzo Mourning added 18 points, eight rebounds and 
eight blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us not close the casket and put the nails in it and throw the dirt on the 
grave at this point," said Thompson, who has insisted since the beginning of 
the season that the Hoyas are not yet as good as their rankings. "We've had too 
many experiences with this before. ... I saw some very good sparks in some 
things I wanted done. We lost our concentration in spots at the end, but that 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
Particularly early in the Big East season. In the four seasons since Patrick 
Ewing graduated, Georgetown has lost its first Big East road game three times. 
And in the three seasons before this one, the Hoyas started Big East play 3-2, 
3-2 and 1-3 before ending up 11-5, 12-4 and 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect to get experience (early in the season)," Thompson said after 
Tuesday night's game. "That's (when) you want to get experience." 
</P>
<P>
Based on his comments before the game, it is possible that, because of the 
number of newcomers expected to play key roles, he will be more patient than 
usual in this regard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a question of (the newcomers) being good," he said, "but of the 
cohesiveness between inside and outside and offense and defense. That's 
improving, but it still has to improve an awful lot and you have to be 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
It appears his main project this season will be Dikembe Mutombo, the 7-foot-2 
sophomore center from Zaire. "I have to find more time for Mutombo," he said. 
"I think that's very difficult because of some of the language barriers, and 
that definitely has had an effect on his development as a player. (Mutombo's 
native language is a French dialect and, while learning English, he also is 
learning basketball language.) 
</P>
<P>
"But I have to have the courage -- and it's going to take even more courage 
now, because you're getting into the Big East and serious competition -- to get 
him in the game. If not for a large period of time, at least for some quality 
time, where he can get a feel for it." 
</P>
<P>
The sooner Mutombo (two points, one rebound, two blocked shots, two fouls in 
six minutes on Tuesday night) can ripen, the sooner Georgetown will become 
immune to two of the few things that can ail Mourning in particular and the 
Hoyas in general -- foul trouble and zone defenses. 
</P>
<P>
With a team not renowned for its outside-shooting prowess, Thompson said 
Tuesday night: "When Alonzo is not in the ballgame, it definitely is something 
that has an effect on us." 
</P>
<P>
That effect became obvious against Seton Hall when Mourning was replaced after 
committing his third foul with 14 minutes to play and the Hoyas leading, 59-54. 
</P>
<P>
In the moments before the foul, Mourning had scored on a hook shot and a jumper 
from the top of the key and blocked a shot to set up Charles Smith's fast-break 
layup that gave the Hoyas their largest lead of the game -- 59-50. In the 
moments after Mourning's departure, Seton Hall began using a zone defense for 
virtually the first time this season, moved within 63-60 and forced Thompson to 
call time out with 12 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Mourning re-entered the game after the break, and, after the Pirates tied the 
score at 63, Georgetown went back in front, 67-63. Seton Hall retied the game 
at 70 before Mourning again left the game with 8:46 remaining. While he was on 
the bench, the Pirates outscored Georgetown, 12-6, to take an 82-76 lead and 
command of the game.

REGGIE WILLIAMS MAKES 2 CINCINNATI ROSTERS

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
All week long, Reggie Williams of the Cincinnati Bengals has been thinking 
about the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Finance bills. 
</P>
<P>
Gun control bills. 
</P>
<P>
Tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
But what about the Buffalo Bills? 
</P>
<P>
Oh yeah, them too. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, you see, has the most intriguing dual life this side of Clark Kent. 
He is the world's only city councilman-outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Compared to Williams, Bo Jackson is a couch potato. Even Bo hasn't attempted 
two careers at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
But when Williams agreed to accept an appointment to the Cincinnati City 
Council last spring, he knew he was tackling something far more difficult than 
anything he had ever tackled on a football field. 
</P>
<P>
"I approached it vigorously," he said. "I was not willing to give up pro 
football, so I knew this appointment would be a unique challenge. I knew it 
would require a significant time commitment. But I felt the challenge would be 
just the stimulus I needed at this time in my life." 
</P>
<P>
What he didn't realize was that the Bengals, 4-11 last season, would come back 
with a division-winning season, the role of host team in Sunday's AFC title 
game against the Bills and, if they win, a trip to Super Bowl XXIII. 
</P>
<P>
An incredibly hectic work schedule has gotten even worse. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, Williams has proven to be more than just a hand-shaking, 
baby-kissing politician. He studies the issues as diligently as he studies 
opposing offenses. 
</P>
<P>
His routine: 
</P>
<P>
Monday -- This is the day Bengal players get treatment for injuries and look at 
game film from the day before. 
</P>
<P>
Williams finishes all that by early afternoon so he can run downtown to attend 
the weekly meetings of 2 of the 4 committees he is on, the finance and 
infrastructure committees. 
</P>
<P>
Usually done by dinner time, Williams will hang around the city government 
offices until about 7 p.m. to meet with constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to be available to meet with people," he said. "I don't want my 
celebrity status to interfere with my post." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday -- For the other Bengals, this is a day off. 
</P>
<P>
But not for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
He spends the day meeting with special-interest groups, sending his written 
correspondence and attending meetings of the human resource and urban 
development committees. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday -- Time to get his head into football. 
</P>
<P>
Williams goes over the game plan for that weekend's game, watches film of the 
opposition and works out. 
</P>
<P>
All that must be finished by early afternoon so he can rush over to city hall 
in time for the full weekly city council meeting, which can last anywhere from 
2 to 5 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Fall, when we play football, is actually the toughest time in terms of council 
meetings," Williams said. "It's budget time. Everyone comes to plead their 
case." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday -- This is the day he devotes totally to the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Almost totally. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime during the week, he must sneak in budget meetings and others that can 
last as late as 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Friday -- There is practice, and meetings of the football variety. His mind 
shifts from zoning ordinances to zone coverage. 
</P>
<P>
In late afternoon, however, he switches signals again, after receiving the 
agenda for next week's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday -- This is preparation day. And we're not talking football. 
</P>
<P>
Whether home or away, on an airplane, in a hotel room or his own living room, 
Williams is buried in council material. While his teammates might be thinking 
about the home-field advantage, he's more concerned with the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"I've probably got to do the biggest amount of preparation of anybody on the 
council," he said. "As the newest member, I have to play a lot of catch-up. I 
have to do a lot of historical research on subjects I am not that familiar 
with." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday -- No council business. No politics. All Williams has to do is to go out 
and play football. 
</P>
<P>
Yet with all the apparent distractions, at 34 and in his ninth pro season, 
Williams has continued to excel as starting right outside linebacker. He is 
among the team leaders in tackles and continues to receive high grades from his 
coaches for his play. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel my being on the council is one of those factors that has contributed to 
the success of our team," Williams said. "I really do. It gives our locker room 
an added dimension. It gives our players a variety of subjects to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, there was a major controversy here in Cincinnati over the passing 
of a gun ordinance, one that would require a 15-day waiting period. Among our 
players, there are many hunters who had opinions on the subject. Now they feel 
they have input into the city they are paying taxes to. They are very 
interested in where their tax dollars are going." 
</P>
<P>
They are also interested in where their team is going. Outside interests, even 
of a positive nature, routinely create as many jeers as cheers among teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of doubting Thomases early on," Williams said. "People felt I 
was going to hurt the team. I was not going to do my job. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a challenge. But that was what was most appealing. I knew it was going 
to tax everything I had, but it was a challenge I wanted, a challenge I needed. 
The pursuit of excellence in one endeavor complements the pursuit of excellence 
in another. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times, I did think I had bit off more than I could chew. But by finding a 
way to digest it, I became a better person. The biggest challenge is finding 
free time. If you try to go out, you're public property. Everybody wants to 
share their agenda with you." 
</P>
<P>
Especially opposing players. The scene will usually go like this: 
</P>
<P>
Williams will bury his helmet in the stomach of an opposing ball carrier. As he 
hits the turf, the runner will look up, smile and say: "Come on, a council 
member shouldn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
Or, "Is that justice? Is that fair?" 
</P>
<P>
Williams has heard it all. 
</P>
<P>
"It can come back to haunt you on the football field," he said. "But overall, I 
think it's good. I'll be on the field talking about urban development with the 
refs. You know they have a variety of jobs in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
Although Williams has talked freely on the field, he has not been so vocal in 
council chambers where he is 1 of 9 council members. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the new kid on the block, " he said of his political role. "I've been 
somewhat insecure about the issues. I've ended up having to turn the other 
cheek many more times than I wanted to. As a National Football League 
linebacker, I'm supposed to be the most intense, violent, brutal person in a 
stadium of thousands. I'm supposed to be the main intimidator. It's different 
in politics." 
</P>
<P>
Williams thought about all that when he was approached to fill out the term of 
Councilman Arn Bortz, who was leaving after a decade to pursue outside 
interests. He thought about how little time it would leave him to spend with 
his wife, Marianna, and his sons, Julian, 6, and Jarren, 4 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
He talked to Jack Kemp, the former Buffalo quarterback who went on to become a 
U.S. Congressman and will serve in President-elect George Bush's cabinet. The 
difference, of course, is that Kemp entered politics after football. 
</P>
<P>
And Williams thought about the irony of someone who had to attend the Michigan 
School for the Deaf in his hometown of Flint, Mich., when he was a youngster to 
overcome speech and hearing problems, entering public life. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would serve as a positive image for football," said Williams of 
his ultimate decision to become a politician. "I wanted to show that we can be 
role models." 
</P>
<P>
He has long been that. Williams already has a resume of public service that 
would put many politicians to shame. He has worked for charities, is a popular 
speaker against drug and alcohol abuse, has been picked NFL man of the year for 
his community work. 
</P>
<P>
"For many years, I shared an apathy with politics that a lot of Americans 
have," he said. "But when I worked with young people, trying to get them 
involved, I realized that I was beginning to sound like a hypocrite. People 
respond to what you do, rather than what you say." 
</P>
<P>
But this week, with the AFC title on the line, even Williams has had to admit 
that his double life is too much. Politics is on hold through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
No meetings. No budgets. No agendas. Well, almost none. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those times where I had to make a real tough decision to do one 
or the other," he said. "Most of my fellow councilmen have encouraged me to go 
to football this week. They are more excited about the possibility of the 
Bengals going to the Super Bowl than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
"But I just can't get away from politics for very long. I'm not attending the 
council meeting this week, but I did have to go to a long hearing on 
appropriations for the fine arts."

YOUNG OLDER, WISER; 
</P>
<P>
BUT 49ER BACKUP IS IN HIS PRIME, NEEDS TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SANTA CLARA, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few minutes into Steve Young's last championship game appearance, at Tempe, 
Ariz., a truck driver in Los Angeles was heading toward the airport with orders 
to tear the uniforms off a team's back if it decided to return home later that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, the Los Angeles Express lost the 1984 Western Conference title game to 
George Allen's desert rats, the Arizona Outlaws, and avoided the embarrassment 
of advancing to one league's version of a Super Bowl with its equipment 
confiscated, locked in storage because of payments past due. 
</P>
<P>
Not even Steve Young believes he could have played the United States Football 
League's title game that year without a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to know who's wearing our pants now," Young said this week. 
"Somebody's probably dyed them." 
</P>
<P>
Whenever Young gets a slight case of the blues, and he has one now because the 
San Francisco 49ers plan to start Sunday's NFC championship game without him, 
he wonders what became of his old uniform pants. 
</P>
<P>
Every quarterback in controversy needs a release. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomczak admitted seeking counsel when his situation in Chicago became 
unbearable. Well, for 2 seasons, Steve Young leaned back on a couch known as 
the Express, a sporting aberration that blipped off football's radar screen in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Young, remember, was supposed to save the USFL. Instead, he realized all too 
soon that he and his hyper-inflated, over-publicized contract did far more harm 
to the league than good. Young admitted once in a moment of guilt that he may 
have indeed "ruined football" before his 23rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe in the long run, it'll be the thing that will make me handle any 
situation that comes along," Young said this week of his USFL experience. 
"Because I don't think there's anything I haven't seen. Well, maybe the Super 
Bowl's the only thing I haven't seen yet. And maybe I'll see that next week. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little better person for it, if you're looking at it in those terms. How 
can you not learn about yourself, about people, about politics, business, 
sports? I've seen it all. Well, not all, but I feel like I've seen a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, nothing previously seen or felt compares to the Angst Young is 
experiencing now -- playing backup to the great Joe Montana. Not Express owner 
Bill Oldenburg poking Young in the chest with his stubby index finger, or the 
water company shutting off the Express' spigots, or Young's playing running 
back in his last USFL game. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the things I've been through, watching is the worst," he said. "Because 
at least then you were playing. You could go out and compete." 
</P>
<P>
The subject of Young's life, of course, must always be broached with 
perspective. He remains one of the sporting world's richest and most eligible 
bachelors, his latest engagement having collapsed at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
Young's financial gatherings are legendary. He escaped the USFL with a cool $4 
million stashed into his faded blue jeans for less than 2 seasons' work, then 
quickly signed another deal with Tampa Bay of the NFL for $5.4 million over 6 
years. 
</P>
<P>
All that said, money and Steve Young have never been comfortable partners. 
Money prefers silk in its shirts. Young fancies the ones with alligators. Money 
drives a Mercedes. Young squeezed 270,000 miles out of his family's 1965 
Oldsmobile before it finally died last year of natural causes. Young has since 
purchased a Jeep -- a demonstrator floor model. It was less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Young has always seemed more introspective than material, and more pressing 
than a lifetime of riches at the moment is a daily and delicate battle for the 
starting quarterback job with the 32-year-old Montana, who has recognized 
Young's threat to his throne and seized the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's made Joe that much more competitive," 49er Coach Bill Walsh said 
of Young. "Joe knows he's got a great talent right alongside of him." 
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Montana has held off the charge. In 1987, subbing for an oft-injured 
Montana, who was returning from back surgery, Young finished with a stunning 
quarterback rating of 120.8, 10 touchdowns and no interceptions. Good enough to 
beat out Jay Schroeder, maybe, but not Montana. 
</P>
<P>
In last season's divisional playoff game against Minnesota, Young was summoned 
from the bench to replace the struggling Montana with the 49ers trailing, 
27-10. Young nearly made it a game, completing 12 of 17 passes for 158 yards 
and a touchdown. He also rushed for 72 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Some thought the quarterback torch had been passed, considering Montana's age 
and injuries. Young figured his time had come. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel I'm coming into the main years of my career and that it's important 
that I play," Young said. "I think Bill knows that. So we need to take a look 
at some of that. That's the bottom line. To stand there and watch is . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Killing you? 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the anticipated quarterback controversy of 1988 developed only 
in the media, Walsh contends. A fit Montana was always going to be his starter. 
The problem this year, of course, has been determining how fit Montana is. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has handled Montana with care, replacing him with Young when he thought 
the situation required it. Montana fought battles this season with bruised 
ribs, a sore back and a form of dysentery that cut 10 pounds from his already 
slender frame. 
</P>
<P>
The situation wasn't an easy for Young, who was thrown into games against the 
New York Giants, Rams and Minnesota Vikings. Young completed 54 of 101 passes 
for 680 yards this season with 3 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He also rushed 
for 184 yards on 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe's always on the edge," Young said of Montana's physical condition. "Always 
on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, in fact, would not be appearing in Sunday's title game had it not 
been for Young's 49-yard touchdown scramble Oct. 30, a dazzling, spinning, 
lurching last-minute run for glory that beat the Vikings, 24-21. 
</P>
<P>
But Young isn't in this business for cameo roles. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure try to play perfect when I'm in there, because I know I need to 
overcome his greatness," Young said of Montana. "Hopefully, I've pushed him in 
some ways to make him a greater player." 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Young has admitted to walking on eggs when it comes to this 
subject. How do you say you're better than Joe Montana? You don't. 
</P>
<P>
Also, considering Montana's fragility, Young knows how close he always is to 
the starting lineup. The Giants knocked Montana out cold in a 1986 playoff 
game. The Chicago Bears may do the same Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I start to say how frustrating this is, I say, 'OK, but this 
Sunday, you may have to take the team to the championship,' " Young said. "You 
tell yourself to stop, forget complaining, and get ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Young also knows he must walk a delicate line when it comes to Montana, a hero 
of the first order in San Francisco. Young is an admirer of Montana but, like 
any great athlete, also of himself. He isn't shy about going head to head with 
a football legend. 
</P>
<P>
"No, not at all," he said. "I felt I was making headway. I look at it like he's 
had all the opportunities this year and I've had to come off the bench a little 
disorganized and have still been capable of putting some good games together. I 
felt like if I'd gotten all the opportunities, we'd be in the same place." 
</P>
<P>
Montana and Young both recognize that their time is running out. Montana's 
place in history is etched, though. Young's is not. 
</P>
<P>
Young turned 27 in November and can't take too many more years on the bench, 
especially since he relies almost as much on his legs as his arm. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had to use my legs a lot because I have to go in and make things happen," 
he said. "I've got to go in and do something big, or the comparisons (with 
Montana) eat you up. Luckily, I have my legs to help me make some plays that 
can help close the gap a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we're going to get into a competition where I've got to find every guy 
on the field, when I don't play very much, I'm at a disadvantage. My prime is 
the next 4 or 5 years. That's why I'm very anxious -- with a big A. I don't 
think my psyche can take this much longer. It's just too hard." 
</P>
<P>
Young said he is not requesting a trade. He considers playing for the 49ers 
under Walsh a perfect environment for his skills. Young and agent Leigh 
Steinberg knew the risks involved when the trade from Tampa Bay to San 
Francisco was made before the 1987 season. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, though, Montana's future was questionable, because he had 
undergone major back surgery in 1986. Walsh needed Young. And Young needed out 
of Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Young is faced with either beating out a sound Montana outright for the 
job -- an unlikely occurrence -- or waiting for a legend to retire. But when 
will that be? Next year? The year after? 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said that Young's future is with the 49ers, though he hasn't gotten 
around to the details. 
</P>
<P>
"His time will come, we know that," Walsh said. "He'll have a great career, and 
has had one, but he's a real man about this, a gentleman, believe me. Because I 
don't think his situation has been accounted for (well) by the press. He has a 
lot of great football ahead of him. And it will be soon, and he will be a 
premiere quarterback in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Young must sometimes wrestle with the decision he made back in March of 
1984, when he spurned the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Young chose the road less traveled and now must wonder whether it has made all 
the difference in the world. Had Young signed with the Cincinnati Bengals, 
instead of the Express, he'd likely have been an established starter in the NFL 
by now. Instead, he toiled in Los Angeles and Tampa during a 4-year venture 
some might describe as an athletic waste of talent. 
</P>
<P>
But those are the lessons life teaches. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're 21 or 22 . . . I was very immature," he said. "It was an 
interesting decision. It was an interesting chapter in my life. I'd like a few 
more where some good stuff happens."

JIM MURRAY: HE HURDLES PRATFALLS OF UNLUCKY LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You wouldn't give a dog act, or Karnow's Monks, the spot on the bill Greg 
Foster got in life. 
</P>
<P>
Hurdles champion between the eras of Skeets Nehemiah and Roger Kingdom is the 
kind of downplay only orphans of sport like Jess Willard -- between the eras of 
Jack Johnson and Jack Dempsey -- or the handful of guys who came between the 
eras of Bobby Jones and Ben Hogan and Sam Snead, or Red Grange and Tom Harmon, 
get to put up with. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster always had a lock on No. 2. In vaudeville, he'd be the guy who'd 
get to say, "How hot was it?" or, "No, Mr. Bones, why do firemen wear red 
suspenders?" 
</P>
<P>
When Renaldo Nehemiah retired from track and field to try pro football with the 
San Francisco 49ers, every guy with a stopwatch thought that Greg Foster had a 
clear track to the top. For Foster, the name should have been Renaldo Nemesis. 
When Nehemiah broke the world record at Zurich in 1981 -- 12.93 seconds, a 
high-hurdles mark that still stands -- Greg Foster was second in 13.03, which 
is still the best non-winning mark of all time in the event. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Greg Foster came into his glory. Nemesis was gone, and Foster's only 
competition seemed to be a clock. He never lost a race all year coming up to 
the Olympics. He even seemed about to do something that Nehemiah, because of 
the Carter boycott, never got to do -- win an Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
In the U.S. Olympic track and field trials that year, Foster won all 4 of his 
races, heats and final, with rather ridiculous ease. In the final, no one paid 
too much attention to the collegian who finished third, Roger Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
In the Olympics, the whole world paid attention. Kingdom won the gold by less 
than a foot. For Foster, it was Kingdom come. Nemesis II. 
</P>
<P>
But Greg Foster had started that Olympic final under the impression that he had 
jumped the gun. He began to slow down, listening for the recall that never 
came. When he realized it wasn't coming and gathered himself up, he was done in 
by the run-in -- the last 10 meters after the last hurdle. But he lost by only 
3/100ths of a second, 13.23 to 13.20. 
</P>
<P>
He beat Kingdom twice in three races in Europe that fall and then closed him 
out in indoor meets that winter. That made the L.A. outcome even sadder. 
</P>
<P>
Foster took dead aim on the 1988 Olympics. He won at the world championships in 
Rome in '87 and had stepped up his preparation for the trials at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Just 18 days before those trials, on a track at Cal Poly Pomona, Foster had set 
up what hurdlers call the "lead leg drill." This calls for the hurdles to be 
lowered in height from 42 inches to 33, and spaced only 5 meters apart, instead 
of 10, for a technique test. 
</P>
<P>
His leg caught in the unfamiliar pattern and he tumbled heavily to the ground. 
He shattered both bones in his left forearm. His luck was holding. It stayed 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster showed up at Indianapolis with his arm in a cast. It also had so 
many screws and plates in it, you could have played "Lady of Spain" on it with 
a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
Running is balance -- and Greg Foster didn't have any. He was jumping hurdles 
with the world's best athletes when he would have had trouble climbing on a 
bus. One of the great athletic feats of all time was his winning a heat -- in 
13.58 -- and finishing third in another with an arm he couldn't have combed his 
hair or opened a letter with. It was a little like Venus de Milo winning a 
tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
His luck, and his equilibrium, ran out in the semifinals and he knocked over 
more barriers than a drunk trying to sneak up to bed in the dark. He was a DNF. 
The Olympic dream was over once again. 
</P>
<P>
When Roger Kingdom won his second gold medal at Seoul, he began to be a legend 
in his own right. His time of 12.98 was the fastest run in the Olympic highs 
but he was to pay tribute to Foster when he noted that he would have trouble 
taking aim at Nehemiah's world mark. 
</P>
<P>
"When Skeets was running his world records, he had Greg Foster to push him," he 
said. "I'm going to have to do it by myself." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. On the night of Jan. 20, one of the great hurdles fields of history 
will compete in the Sunkist meet at the Sports Arena. Roger Kingdom, Greg 
Foster, Tonie Campbell, the bronze medalist at Seoul after finishing fifth at 
Los Angeles, and Andre Phillips, the man who broke Edwin Moses' Olympic string 
and the only man in modern history to try out for both the 110-meter high 
hurdles and the 400 intermediates in the trials. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster thinks Roger Kingdom will have someone to push him -- Greg Foster. 
He might have the spot on the bill of the guy who has to wave an American flag 
or do bird calls to get attention but he wants all these heroes -- and the 
world -- to know one thing: They had Greg Foster to beat before they got where 
they are. And it was never easy.

MORNING BRIEFING: REYNOLDS WIRED ON SIDELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Reynolds, coach of the Sacramento Kings, is back on the sidelines wearing 
a heart monitor after he collapsed on the court Dec. 27 during a game against 
the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings made things a little easier on Reynolds the other night in his first 
game back when they ran away from the Dallas Mavericks, 123-96. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the game started, I didn't think about my heart," Reynolds said. "I was 
more concerned with Mark Aguirre than whether my heart was pumping. If it 
stops, I figure I'll find out about it soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
Add Reynolds: He was unconscious for about a minute after collapsing face-first 
during the fourth quarter of a close game against the Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds remained motionless for six minutes before being removed from the 
arena on a stretcher. He spent two days in a hospital, where doctors determined 
that stress and a poor diet, not a heart attack, caused the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I fell backward," Reynolds said after viewing a tape of his 
collapse. "I didn't know I was lying there like a drunk." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds is so excitable on the court that players, fans, a radio announcer and 
referee Blaine Reichelt thought the collapse was just another one of his 
antics. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I thought it was one of his regular tantrums," Sacramento guard 
Kenny Smith said. "Then I realized it was serious." 
</P>
<P>
Reichelt was so convinced Reynolds was putting on a show that he called a 
technical foul on the coach but later rescinded it. 
</P>
<P>
Last Add Reynolds: He said he had a nightmare in the hospital in which he was 
"lying there like a beached whale and Jack Nicholson comes along and says, 'NBA 
action, it's fantastic.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Coach Spike Dykes of Texas Tech was told that the Red Raiders' 
regular-season finale against Oklahoma State in Japan had no way of making the 
papers in the United States, he said, "Why do you think we scheduled it?" 
</P>
<P>
Texas Tech lost to Barry Sanders, Hart Lee Dykes and friends, 45-42. 
</P>
<P>
John Reid, a member of the Holiday Bowl selection committee, says there are 
some disadvantages to wearing the committee's flaming red blazer. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to wear it in hotel lobbies," Reid said. "People keep trying to give 
me their luggage." 
</P>

NBC football commentator Joe Namath, with Syracuse holding a 10-7 lead over LSU 
at halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl on New Year's Day: "I think this game is 
definitely going to be decided in the second half."

Mike Tyson was involved in another car accident Thursday, when his 1988 Lincoln 
was hit by another car trying to get around a stalled vehicle, but the 
heavyweight champion wasn't driving at the time. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the accident, which police described as a minor 
fender-bender that slightly damaged the door of Tyson's car. Tyson's longtime 
friend, Rory Holloway, was at the wheel, with promoter Don King riding along, 
when the accident occurred shortly before 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the other car, Michael Credico, a Las Vegas waiter, was cited for 
making an illegal turn, a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The heavyweight champion signed autographs for motorists and police while he 
and King waited for another vehicle to pick them up. "It was just bad luck," 
said Credico, who called Tyson "a helluva nice guy."

TV-RADIO: BUTKUS, FEROCIOUS AS A BEAR, IS REALLY JUST A GENIAL TEDDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You talk to people at CBS about Dick Butkus, who replaced Jimmy (the Greek) 
Snyder on "NFL Today" this season, and you get descriptions such as shy, 
gentle, religious, devoted family man. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. Is this the same Dick Butkus who used to tear people's heads off 
when he was a linebacker for the Chicago Bears? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, same guy. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the exact opposite of the type of person you'd expect him to be," said 
Susan Kerr, a CBS publicist who has worked closely with Butkus. 
</P>
<P>
Said commentator John Madden, who got to know Butkus when both were doing beer 
commercials: "He's a gentle guy with a dry sense of humor, a great practical 
joker. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of his reputation, you're not sure whether you're supposed to laugh or 
not. After a while, you figure out it's OK to laugh." 
</P>
<P>
About his image, Butkus, who has lived in Malibu for the last 6 years, said: "I 
got burned by a couple of sportswriters early in my career, and as a result, 
sort of clamped out. That, combined with the style of football I played, gave 
me that tough-guy image. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd see people in airports who would recognize me but would be afraid to come 
up to me. I'd want to say, 'Hey, it's OK. I'm not a bad guy.' 
</P>
<P>
"It changed a lot after the Miller Lite commercials. They served as an 
icebreaker. People would say, 'Shot any birdies lately?' or something like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Said "NFL Today" colleague Brent Musburger: "I covered him as a writer and 
broadcaster in Chicago when he was with the Bears, and at that time he was 
difficult to deal with. I think it was a combination of shyness and a 
reluctance to talk with the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I do remember him getting burned . . . when he was at Illinois, and later by a 
Chicago writer. 
</P>
<P>
"But once you get to know him and he trusts you, he's a lot of fun to be 
around. He's got a great sense of humor and is able to laugh at himself. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a caring person who comes from a strong Lithuanian family background." 
</P>
<P>
Butkus and his wife Helen have known each other almost their entire lives and 
have been married 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
They have three children: Nikki, who last spring graduated from the University 
of Notre Dame; Rick, a sophomore at UC Santa Barbara, and Matt, a senior at 
Loyola High School in Los Angeles and a heavily recruited defensive lineman. 
Matt, according to Butkus, has narrowed his college choices to USC and 
Illinois, Dad's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Butkus has spent this week preparing for Sunday's NFC championship game (1 
p.m., PST) between the San Francisco 49ers and the Bears at Chicago, which CBS 
will televise, and working on the NBC sitcom, "My Two Dads," which makes its 
season debut next Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. Butkus plays the role of a deli owner. 
</P>
<P>
An acting career is what brought Butkus to Southern California. Before moving 
here, he lived in Florida, on a 30-acre ranch at De Land. 
</P>
<P>
When his football career ended prematurely in 1973, after four knee operations, 
he went there to work for Arthur Jones, the founder of Nautilus weight-training 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
He also did some volunteer work, teaching catechism to inmates at Raiford state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
When Butkus was forced to retire from football, he had 3 years left on a 4-year 
contract. At first, the Bears refused to pay him. Butkus sued, but 2 years 
later, before the case reached a court, the Bears agreed to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought I would remain connected with football, but because of my 
contract hassle, I just wanted to get far away from Chicago," Butkus said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, he returned to the Bears as a radio commentator from 1985 
through 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Now he's returning to Chicago for a playoff game for the second straight 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
In the 9 seasons he played for the Bears and the 3 seasons he served as a radio 
commentator, Butkus said, he never saw fog at Soldier Field as there was last 
Saturday for the Bear-Philadelphia game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was down on the sidelines, and I could see across the field, except for a 
few minutes when it really got dense," Butkus said. "Battling the elements is 
part of football. No way should the game have been postponed." 
</P>
<P>
Said Madden: "If I'd been there, I would have gone right down to the sidelines. 
I've always wanted to do a game from the sidelines, and that would have given 
me the perfect opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
Butkus' work on "NFL Today" has shown improvement through the season. Early on, 
he seemed nervous and unsure of himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I was nervous because I would spend all week on the phone gathering 
information and would want to use all of it," Butkus said. "Brent told me to 
edit it down and just use what's important and forget the rest. That advice 
helped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Said Musburger: "He was juggling five or six thoughts at once in his mind and, 
working alongside someone like me who talks very quickly, it made him nervous. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'If you can make one good point, we'll sell it for you.' 
</P>
<P>
"Dick is very perceptive, and he understands the game of football. Having him 
on the show has been a big plus. 
</P>
<P>
"It sure is a lot different this year with Dick. There's less friction. We're 
now all going in the same direction." 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Are you ready for Dan Dierdorf on boxing? The rumor is that ABC had Dierdorf do 
an audition, liked him and will soon announce that he will be the network's 
blow-by-blow man on boxing, working with Alex Wallau. . . . Add Wallau: He has 
been battling throat cancer for a little more than a year, but is said to be 
doing better. The cancer apparently is in remission. . . . The San Diego Padres 
reportedly are close to hiring former Dodger Rick Monday as an announcer. A new 
series on TBS, "U.S. Olympic Gold," makes its debut Saturday at 3:05 p.m. with 
a team of U.S. amateur boxers facing a South Korean team. Anthony Hembrick, 
best known for missing a bus and being disqualified for tardiness at Seoul, is 
the only U.S. Olympian participating. And none of the South Korean Olympians 
will participate. All have either retired or turned pro. 
</P>
<P>
NBC begins its AFC championship coverage Sunday at 9 a.m. with "NFL Live." 
Ahmad Rashad offers a feature on Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly, and Gayle 
Gardner focuses on Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason. . . . Add Esiason: 
While attending the University of Maryland, he worked as an intern at a 
Baltimore TV station, WJZ, at the same time Gardner worked there. . . . Dick 
Enberg and Merlin Olsen will announce the game. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's first "Wide World of Sports" program of 1989 Saturday at 4:30 p.m. (3:30 
in San Diego) will highlight figure skating, taped at Paris Dec. 16. It's the 
World Challenge of Champions, and the skaters include Brian Boitano, Scott 
Hamilton, Brian Orser, Dorothy Hamill, Debi Thomas and Rosalyn Sumners. . . . 
Although today's round as well as Saturday's round of the MONY Tournament of 
Champions at La Costa will be on ESPN live at 1 p.m. both days, Sunday's final 
round will be on ABC, delayed at 2 p.m. . . . Add golf: ESPN will televise the 
first 3 rounds of next week's Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, beginning Wednesday, 
and NBC will televise the final 2 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
New show: "Billy Packer's College Basketball" will make its debut on Prime 
Ticket at 6 tonight. The show will run through April 8. . . . ABC's pro 
bowlers' tour begins its 16th season Saturday with the Pinole Open from Pinole, 
Calif., delayed at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
John Mohr, who was vice president and executive producer of sports programming 
for ON TV from 1977 to '83, has been named senior vice president and chief 
operating officer of SportsChannel Regional Networks. SportsChannel operates in 
New York, Philadelphia, New England, Chicago and Florida. . . . Chris Myers, 
ESPN's relatively new West Coast correspondent, came to the cable network from 
the CBS affiliate in New Orleans, where he was a weekend sports anchor. Myers, 
a Florida native, is ESPN's first full-time West Coast correspondent since Jim 
Gray left to join NBC last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Add Gray: In his interview with referee Jim Tunney about why last Saturday's 
NFL playoff game at Chicago was not postponed, Tunney said because he could see 
both goal posts from midfield. "But I can't see 15 yards in this stuff," Gray 
said. Countered Tunney: "Well, everyone knows referees can see better than 
broadcasters."

ESPN GETS CABLE RIGHTS TO BASEBALL, STARTING IN 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling it an exceptional deal for baseball fans, Commissioner Peter Ueberroth 
Thursday announced that ESPN has acquired cable television rights to major 
league baseball, beginning in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, which got the rights with a 4-year, $400-million agreement, will televise 
175 games a season, with single games Sunday and Wednesday nights and 
doubleheaders Tuesday and Friday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
The cable network will also televise games on opening day and holidays and will 
show 6 to 10 spring training games. 
</P>
<P>
"Fans will now be able to see all the teams from both leagues," Ueberroth said. 
"Also, ESPN will be able to switch from one game to another. If a kid pitcher 
up from the minors is pitching a no-hitter for the Texas Rangers, ESPN can pick 
up that game in the ninth inning." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about fans who can't get cable or can't afford it, Ueberroth said: "The 
number of games on free over-the-air television is continuing to increase. 
Also, cable is now available in 87% of the homes in the country and it could be 
90% by the time this package takes effect." 
</P>
<P>
ESPN is in 50.1 million homes, or 55.5% of the nation's television households. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's deal was announced less than a month after CBS agreed to a 4-year, 
$1-billion-plus contract to televise the playoffs, World Series, All-Star game 
and 12 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN outbid Turner Broadcasting, SportsChannel America and the USA network for 
the cable package. Ueberroth said ESPN and Turner were the finalists. 
</P>
<P>
The package also includes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A special half-hour highlights show every weeknight. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coverage of the Equitable Old-Timers All-Star game as well as additional 
All-Star game-related programming. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A season-opening special. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Special World Series programming. 
</P>
<P>
Ueberroth said superstations such as Chicago's WGN and Atlanta's TBS would 
continue televising baseball.

Waad Hirmez scored 10:09 into overtime Thursday night as the Lazers defeated 
the San Diego Sockers, 6-5, in a Major Indoor Soccer League game before a crowd 
of 4,136 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers, who had lost 10 of 14 games, improved to 7-10 with their third 
victory over San Diego in 4 games this season. San Diego, which had a 5-game 
winning streak snapped, is 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
The Lazers' Fernando Clavijo, playing as the sixth attacker, sent the game into 
overtime when he got his own rebound and scored with 2:29 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers had taken a 5-4 lead with 7:31 remaining on a goal by Cacho. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded goals after being tied, 2-2, at halftime. Kevin Crow gave San 
Diego a 3-2 lead early in the third quarter, but Steve Kinsey tied it for the 
Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
Ralf Wilhelms put the Sockers ahead again, 4-3, late in the third quarter, but 
the Lazers tied it on a goal by Gary Heale with 12 minutes left. CHRIS ELLO

NEWSWIRE: NCAA OFFICIAL DEFENDS THE PRACTICE OF GIVING IMMUNITY TO INFORMANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David Berst, director of enforcement for the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn., took issue Thursday with statements made by Ron Watson, assistant 
athletic director at Oklahoma. Watson criticized the NCAA for giving Oklahoma 
State wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes immunity in exchange for information 
implicating four schools in recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to find out what really happened, you have to have limited 
immunity," Berst told the Tulsa Tribune. "Without limited immunity we couldn't 
find out a lot of what happens and wouldn't be able to penalize a lot of 
institutions that are cheating." 
</P>
<P>
Berst noted that an unidentified Oklahoma player also had received immunity for 
testifying about the Sooner football program.

Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin became the first woman governor to serve three 
terms when she took office Thursday, and a former governor in New Hampshire 
collapsed during inaugural activities and was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
In Concord, N. H., former Gov. John King was reported in guarded condition 
after collapsing during the inauguration of Republican Gov. Judd Gregg. 
</P>
<P>
About an hour after Gregg's inaugural speech, King "slumped to one side" in a 
chair, said Mert Mann, an aide to Rep. Chuck Douglas. King, 72, was given 
oxygen as he was taken from the Statehouse on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
King was governor from 1963 to 1969 and chief justice of the state Supreme 
Court from 1981 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In Vermont, Kunin asked state residents to think globally to help quell the 
threats of nuclear war and environmental destruction. 
</P>
<P>
"Increasingly we find Vermont's triumphs and Vermont's problems linked with 
those of people around the globe," Kunin said.

THE WORD ON 'TALK RADIO'; 
</P>
<P>
ERIC BOGOSIAN FINDS STORY IN THE 'FRINGE ELEMENT' OF THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time, "Talk Radio" was a small play that writer-performer Eric 
Bogosian and Portland, Ore., artist Tad Savinar developed at the Portland 
Center for the Visual Arts, and then moved to Joe Papp's Public Theatre in New 
York in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It gathered attention to itself, but it was benign fame, scaled to the 
intimate, often insular theater world. 
</P>
<P>
The attention -- centered on Bogosian, whose reputation was reaching a zenith 
after cultivating the New York borderland between performance art and the stage 
for 10 years -- was enough to get producer Ed Pressman interested in making a 
movie out of what was basically a monologue by a guy behind a mike. 
</P>
<P>
And now, just as Oliver Stone's film version (co-scripted with Bogosian) has 
changed the play, so the reaction has changed. "Talk Radio," the movie, is 
controversial stuff -- especially on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
In the film's opening weeks, it's been difficult to turn on a talk show and not 
hear on-air exchanges about it. And it's often the talk show hosts themselves 
who issue the most cutting attacks on "Talk Radio" (see Judith Michaelson's 
accompanying article). 
</P>
<P>
For Bogosian, a lot of it is hot air. 
</P>
<P>
"To slam a movie about hate radio for fostering hate is like saying that a 
movie about the Ku Klux Klan will foster the Klan," he says, adding that the 
death threats against Barry Champlain, "Talk Radio's" shock jock, are not the 
imaginings of a feverish, Hollywood-inspired imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"A radio host in Pittsburgh showed me written threats he received." Yet to be 
completely authentic to all facets of a radio show, Bogosian notes, "would turn 
the movie into a stiff. Most radio stations are pretty uneventful." 
</P>
<P>
What about complaints that a Champlain-type host would never get a three-day 
notice, as happens in the movie, before getting launched on a national network? 
</P>
<P>
"OK, they got me there," he admits. "We also didn't use the seven-second 
delay." 
</P>
<P>
What really raises Bogosian's temperature, though, is the perception that "Talk 
Radio" is meant as a representation of all radio. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, part of the media -- TV and radio -- is dominated by self-centered 
big-mouths. The Morton Downeys, the Howard Sterns. Those were the guys who 
inspired Barry Champlain. But they're a fringe element. We're not talking about 
the strait-laced hosts like Michael Jackson or Toni Grant." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian couldn't resist getting on the "Talk Radio" thumbs-up-or-down survey 
trend, and based on what he in half-jest called his "poll," a minority of radio 
people are critical of the movie. 
</P>
<P>
"If you poll guys like Barry," he says, "they hate it. Besides, the movie's not 
just about radio. It's a portrait of the lost, soulless show business 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Bogosian is in a Beverly Hills hotel suite, and he's trying very hard to 
get comfortable. New York-based, he likes to get the material for his 
performance works ("FunHouse," "Drinking in America") by, among other things, 
dropping in on transvestite bars and Bowery coffee shops filled with hookers 
and pimps. His life, he'll tell you, has had its wild passages. 
</P>
<P>
That's the past. He's 35 and married and has a young child. Home is no longer 
Little Italy, but the New Jersey countryside. No more the hustle of performance 
art gigs in downtown lairs. Now he picks his movies and prepares pieces for HBO 
broadcast (such as his upcoming "Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll"). 
</P>
<P>
He roams the suite, pointing his guest to a sofa chair ("You want to sit 
here?"), unsure where he wants to sit, circling around the room ("Or how about 
here?"). With curly hair, tight jeans and pointed shoes, Bogosian looks like 
he's in alien territory, wondering how he got here. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for my life to run on a few separate tracks," he says, "and one 
of them has to be dangerous." He was referring to his visits to deepest Gotham, 
an adventure where theater and anthropology meet. "Too many of these hotel 
suites, and I'll go soft and run out of things to write about." 
</P>
<P>
Such a crisis seems inconceivable at this point. Bogosian says he has felt such 
a "charge" from doing the "Talk Radio" publicity tour that he's finding himself 
writing every day -- "something I've never experienced before" -- and sure 
enough, there's an electric typewriter next to the room phone. 
</P>
<P>
He has reason to write. As well as "Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll," he's working 
on "Blue Smoke," a screenplay for Universal about New York's jazz underground 
in the '50s. He's also looking ahead to an ensemble play based on his youthful 
years in middle-class Woburn, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian, then, can't be counted among those amazed at Oliver Stone's work pace 
-- editing "Talk Radio" while preparing his next film, "Born on the Fourth of 
July," for instance. 
</P>
<P>
"He does push it harder than me, though," he adds. "And I found that the 
element Oliver and I share is answering the question, 'What do I want to do?' 
The work is the important thing." 
</P>
<P>
Stone and he also veer apart in a classically generational way. 
</P>
<P>
"While Oliver was entrenched in the '60s, I came up in the '70s. I'm suspicious 
of the Establishment and the anti-Establishment. I'm also not of a school with 
a message to send, but of a smaller school which has something on its mind to 
talk about for an hour or two." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian follows up on this, perhaps thinking like the exposed performer on 
stage: "My view is to look at yourself, the individual. Oliver's is to look at 
society. And there's that conflict in the film." 
</P>
<P>
Stone agrees with this assessment. However, Stone, talking by phone from 
Dallas, where "Talk Radio" was filmed and where he is editing "Born on the 
Fourth of July," remarked: "I've never worked with anyone who was more intense 
than I am. Eric seems to know no limits." 
</P>
<P>
"Talk Radio's" Barry Champlain uses the airwaves as a kind of blunt weapon and 
a shield to ward off what really is on his mind. Like shockmeister Howard 
Stern, he uses callers as cannon fodder for listeners' entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
The late Alan Berg's biography, "Talked to Death," written by Steven Singular, 
was used by Bogosian and Stone as narrative ballast in "Talk Radio's" 
stage-to-screen transfer. 
</P>
<P>
Like Berg, Champlain antagonizes the white supremacist group The Order. In real 
life, two Order members were given 50-year sentences in December, 1987, for 
Berg's 1984 murder in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
That was after Bogosian and Savinar molded "Talk Radio" for the theater. Even 
after Pressman became involved and bought the rights to Singular's book for 
expanding the screenplay beyond the stage script, Bogosian says that it was 
voices such as Stern's and Bob Grant's that remained the key sources for 
Champlain's character. 
</P>
<P>
He'll also reveal that Champlain's real father was an outrageous punk-like 
persona, named Ricky Paul, whom Bogosian adopted during his days in the '70s 
playing tough New York clubs as well as the alternative art haven, The Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
"I did a verbal assault on the audience, like the punk groups did, only with 
words and action rather than guitars." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian credits, as well, certain artist-friends of his, such as painters 
Robert Longo and David Salle, for their various techniques of juxtaposing 
seemingly incongruous images. They taught him, he says, "all sorts of secrets 
for writing." 
</P>
<P>
Another source was movies -- particularly Elia Kazan and Budd Schulberg's 
masterfully caustic tale of TV's early days "A Face in the Crowd." The "Face" 
was Lonesome Rhodes, played by then-newcomer Andy Griffith, who turned from a 
humble country bumpkin into a monstrous video megastar. 
</P>
<P>
"What disturbed me more, though," Bogosian says, "was Kazan. He wrote, 
directed, liked to do it all. I sometimes see myself -- the dark side -- in 
him. He ruined his and other's lives more than once. I wonder about the 
ambitious artist, devouring everything." 
</P>
<P>
This awareness, he suggests, has come about through a combination of two 
factors that ultimately made "Talk Radio": his growing ability to discipline 
himself and get down to work, and looking at mass media. 
</P>
<P>
"Our society thinks by way of mass media," he observes, sounding a little like 
Oliver Stone. "It isolates us. Yet the good thing about talk radio is that it 
brings companionship. I know when I was out alone on the road, that voice 
coming over the air was a comfort. Then is mass media destroying relationships? 
I don't know. And I don't want to analyze it too much, because my creative 
needs come out of emotions, not theories." 
</P>
<P>
On disciplining himself, he digs deeper: "My wife, Jo Anne, used to say about 
me that she never knew anyone who did less in a day than I did. I'd get up at 
noon because I'd been up all night. And, of course, before writing, it was 
essential to hang out with my pals sipping coffee. By the time all this was 
done, there was no time to write. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the saturation point when I married Jo Anne (in 1980). We married right 
after we met, and I went right out on a European tour. I had to get it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The next saturation point was when he was performing "Drinking in America" at 
Lincoln Center eight times a week. "I thought I could slide like before. No 
way. I had to be on. It was like having to perform terrific sex every night at 
8. You have to develop an area of calm around that. Now I'm able to write at 
will -- almost." 
</P>
<P>
Bogosian admits to enjoying the small storm kicked up by "Talk Radio," and he 
isn't shy about acknowledging that he would like to wield some creative power 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Then he catches himself: "It's not that fame and attention can be temporal. 
They are temporal."

THE WORD ON 'TALK RADIO'; 
</P>
<P>
MIXED REACTION TO FILM FROM REAL TALK-SHOW HOSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MICHAELSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And what do talk-radio show hosts say about "Talk Radio" -- that movie where 
off-the-wall chatter between listener and host bounces back and feeds on itself 
and where, from the very beginning, the viewer knows that the man at the mike 
will be assassinated? 
</P>
<P>
Some seemingly speak non-stop about it. Others are not talking at all. Still 
others have resisted seeing it. And KABC-AM (790), which likes to call itself 
the "talk radio" station, has banned any advertising or even discussion of the 
film on its air. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm angry about it," said KFI-AM's Tom Leykis, "because there was no need to 
kill the main character. Using the shooting of (Denver radio show host) Alan 
Berg was, I think, a smarmy attempt to capitalize on all the publicity that 
that murder got. Alan Berg was a far more interesting character than the 
character in the movie. . . . What really troubles me is that this is the 
second movie in less than a year where a radio host is killed. Remember 
'Betrayed,' where a liberal talk-show host got shot by a right-wing extremist? 
It's real convenient for Hollywood to use radio talk-show hosts as fodder." 
</P>
<P>
"It scares the hell out of me," admitted deejay Jay Thomas of KPWR-FM, who 
worries about "Talk Radio" prompting copy-cat murder attempts. 
</P>
<P>
"Some nut goes up there and shoots the hell out of him. Early in my career in 
Los Angeles, I was chased by a nut with a knife. I guess he thought my face was 
incredibly ugly on the bus. . . .," Thomas quipped, referring to KPWR's ads 
plastered across the sides of Los Angeles buses with his face and the slogan, 
"We apologize for Jay Thomas this morning." 
</P>
<P>
"The movie was so dark and depressing," Thomas said. "That's not the kind of 
radio I do. I play records; I make jokes. They threaten me, I take it back." 
</P>
<P>
"Talk Radio" is loosely based on the life of Berg, a liberal who was gunned 
down by white supremacists in 1984. Like Berg, whose show was on station KOA, 
the character of Barry Champlain (played by Eric Bogosian) had been in the 
men's clothing business and had a quirky yet close relationship with his 
ex-wife. Berg was killed in the driveway of his condominium after arriving home 
from a dinner date with her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible film," fumed George Green, president and general manager at 
KABC-AM. "It's a misrepresentation of what this business is all about. I told 
them (the hosts of his station's programs) not to give any publicity on the air 
to that movie. Of course, what they say in a newspaper is up to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We've spent 25, 30 years portraying talk radio as being a quality medium with 
quality people," Green added, "and they (the movie makers) took one small piece 
of talk-radio history with some murder in Denver and took a tremendous 
director, Oliver Stone, and concocted a picture that misrepresented what people 
listen to. They portray sickies who may be listening to other stations -- but 
very few (stations). Very few managers would tolerate that kind of personality. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Hollywood at its worst," he said. "This picture is not doing this 
community any good. There's enough hostility in a community without reaching 
down for an incident uncomfortable to people in our business. . . . The real 
world is conversations. Do you think there's any semblance between the motion 
picture and our radio station?" 
</P>
<P>
Larry King said the fact that he was the only actual talk-show personality 
mentioned in the movie -- "you're going to be another Larry King," Champlain is 
told early on -- "makes it embarrassing not to like the movie. Alan Berg was 
very liberal. Morton Downey is very conservative. This guy (Champlain) really 
had no opinion. I would not listen to that show. It's a kind of one-note show. 
The caller calls in. He's going to get angry. You didn't learn anything at all. 
I was bored. Mostly I was bored. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not racing out to see it," said Lee Larson, vice president of KOA in 
Denver, who had been the general manager at the time of Berg's murder. "I raced 
to read the book, and I found it very good and enjoyable. It captured the 
complexity of Alan, and it also helped you see where he was serious and where 
he was being a good entertainer. But since the movie was not a true reflection 
on his life, it's not the first thing I want to see. 
</P>
<P>
"People tend to exaggerate the talk-show host," Larson added, "especially right 
now with what's happening in television talk, with the debate as to whether 
some of the talk shows are trash television or a responsible form of 
entertainment. And Alan was certainly one pioneer in that area, being somewhat 
outrageous in the topics he chose to talk about, some of the opinions he 
expressed and the vehemence with which he expressed them." 
</P>
<P>
Not all the talk about "Talk Radio" was negative. 
</P>
<P>
KGIL-AM's Carole Hemingway deemed "Talk Radio" "a very powerful movie. Oliver 
Stone wanted to point out just where all the hate leads. It leads to a dead-end 
street, and we've been sort of inundated with the Morton Downeys, the Geraldos 
and their imitators on radio. . . . I'll tell you something that doesn't ring 
true. You never ever get that plethora of sick calls, one after another, but if 
a talk-show host spews and breeds hatred the way this one does, anything can 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns that the movie "puts all of us in danger," Leykis said he 
found "Talk Radio" to be the "most realistic portrayal of radio" that he's 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
"The relatively dark studio in which he paces around. He calls people names. I 
do. He hangs up, which I do, and (the idea that) talent is nothing but meat. . 
. . And the board operator, the engineer, was a carbon copy of the engineer I 
had 10 years ago in Phoenix. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
What sounded particularly false to several talk hosts was the fact that 
Bogosian's character would be told his program was being picked up for national 
syndication with just three days' notice. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, where he has been on WMCA for 38 years, Barry Gray said he hadn't 
seen the film. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be psychological because it played here in New York, and I didn't go 
see the play either. The Alan Berg kind of radio is not what I do. Michael 
Jackson (of KABC-AM) and I are much more alike. Today I talked with a local 
Washington bureau chief about (Michael) Dukakis' announcement he was not going 
to run for governor (of Massachusetts) again, and whether that meant he was 
running for President again. That's the kind of radio I do. I'm not into 
insulting people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think shock radio is going to shock itself out of business in another year. 
Like the Enquirer, there are just so many three-headed monkeys you can write 
about." 
</P>
<P>
And in New York, where disc jockey Howard Stern of WXRK has made a splash with 
sharp jibes and put-downs, agent Don Buchwald explained that "quite frankly, he 
(Stern) hasn't been commenting on that (movie) at all." Then, interrupting a 
reporter's question, Buchwald hung up.

THE WORD ON 'TALK RADIO'; 
</P>
<P>
ARE THE AIRWAVES TURNING INTO A LETHAL WEAPON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, Times Television Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The foul, nasty brilliance of semi-fictional Barry Champlain. The snarling, 
yelling, ranting, posturing vapidity of Morton Downey Jr. The anything-goes 
opportunism of Geraldo Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
They all beg the question: At what point do the airwaves become a lethal 
weapon? 
</P>
<P>
At this point: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Champlain, the obsessed, seething, self-destructive protagonist of 
Oliver Stone's new movie, "Talk Radio," answers a right-wing zealot's death 
threats with his own taunts, or snaps at another caller: "I like you blacks. I 
think everyone should own one!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Downey, with his studio transformed into a Roman forum turning thumbs 
down on a gladiator, screams at a guest: "Even Satan wouldn't puke on you!" 
</P>
<P>
 -- When a taping of "Geraldo," pitting white supremacists against a black 
civil rights figure before a combustible studio audience, erupts in violence. 
</P>
<P>
There are times when we gain more insight into television from going to movies 
-- "Network," "Broadcast News" -- than from watching television. Although the 
setting for "Talk Radio" is a Dallas AM station whose outrageous star is 
modeled after radio talkers Howard Stern of New York and the late Alan Berg of 
Denver, Stone's movie also directly pertains to "The Morton Downey Jr. Show," 
"Geraldo" and any other program whose frequent aim is confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
These shows draw energy from wrath, seeking to turn rage into ratings. They 
play a game of "chicken," hoping to go as far as they can go before swerving at 
the last second and avoiding a head-on collision. 
</P>
<P>
The great peril -- a la that explosive "Geraldo" episode that resembled a 
hockey brawl -- is that they'll swerve 
</P>
<P>
too late. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the gallant wounded warrior after his nose was smashed by a flying 
chair, Rivera ejected the white supremacists -- who had served their purpose -- 
and continued the taping, earning huge ratings when the heavily promoted 
episode aired later. 
</P>
<P>
Next time, someone may be killed. But -- given our spiraling lust for TV 
aggression through constant exposure to these shows -- will anyone care? 
</P>
<P>
Barry Champlain also works on the edge in "Talk Radio," which is far closer to 
broadcasting's anger mania than is "Midnight Caller," the derivative NBC series 
(9 p.m. Tuesdays) whose do-gooding hero, Steve Killian, is a sort of Batman of 
the airwaves, using his radio talk show to further the cause of morality and 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Killian (Gary Cole) runs around San Francisco serving humanity, when 
he's not doing the same thing via radio, Champlain (Eric Bogosian) is Morton 
Downey Jr. with wit and brains, finally admitting to his listeners: "I don't 
give a damn about you or your world!" 
</P>
<P>
Champlain appears ready to go up in flames. He's neurotic, exposed nerve 
endings, an open, oozing wound -- an unpredictable abrasion who insults and 
verbally mugs his callers, frequently to mask his own self-hatred: "It's 
gutless, mindless people like you who make me puke!" Many of the bricks who 
call him are fringies from both the left and the right -- bigots and racists 
who get slapped down in mid-sentence: "You pinheaded, red-necked moron!" 
</P>
<P>
Through Bogosian's mesmerizing performance (Richard Libertini was also a 
compelling Alan Berg type in "Betrayed"), we see the ugly dangers of combat 
broadcasting, what could happen with radio and video amok with Champlains, 
Downeys, Riveras and other self-serving commandos of the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
Like Berg, the radio talk-show host who was murdered by members of a neo-Nazi 
group in 1984, and the late Joe Pyne, who pioneered insult radio many years 
earlier, Champlain is a human match, an explosion waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Champlain truly exists only inside the booth, however -- where his show 
assumes a claustrophobic life of its own, physically isolated from out-of-doors 
reality -- NBC's Killian truly lives only outside the booth. 
</P>
<P>
"You shoot from the hip, and this is not a subject for that," Killian's boss, 
Devon King (Wendy Kilbourne), warned him when he did a show on AIDS without her 
approval. "The last thing is for someone to come along and feed the hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
That San Francisco, of all places, needed lecturing on any aspect of AIDS from 
Killian, strained credibility. The irony, however, was that King's admonition 
-- although well-taken in a generic sense -- was more applicable to someone 
like Champlain than Killian, who, despite his relative bluntness and rough 
edges, is a wimp compared to his "Talk Radio" counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
Broadcasting is not what ex-cop Killian is really about anyway, for "Midnight 
Caller" is essentially a stock adventure series with private-eye shadings and 
radio trimmings. In Lt. Carl Zymack (Arthur Taxier), moreover, Killian even has 
the formulaic weary police buddy who goes out on a limb for Jack and gets him 
inside info. 
</P>
<P>
Killian can use it. In that recent, controversial episode on AIDS, he hit the 
streets and also used his show to foil a bisexual AIDS victim who was knowingly 
endangering others with a spree of one-night stands. In another episode -- 
featuring a bitter paraplegic stereotype, supported by an Amos 'n' Andy black 
reporter stereotype, Killian stopped a suicide/murder. 
</P>
<P>
And last Tuesday, Killian got involved in a bank 
robbery/hostage-taking/shootout, briefly going on the air inside the bank to 
allow one of the robbers -- a deranged Vietnam vet stereotype -- to "tell your 
side of the story." 
</P>
<P>
The episode began with a former anchorman who operated a TV station offering to 
"buy" Killian and his engineer for the station's news. "Does it bother you that 
I'm not a journalist?" Killian wondered. "TV news isn't journalism any more," 
the man replied. "It's about numbers, drama." 
</P>
<P>
The words may have been true, but they would have had far more juice from the 
mouth of a less ludicrous character. 
</P>
<P>
Later, hearing about the bank robbery/hostage crisis, the station owner began 
barking orders to his staff: 
</P>
<P>
"Get two minicam units with microwave transmitters in place. . . . Get the guys 
in the studio to use slo mos, stop actions and instant replay for the killings. 
And listen, set up a Telestrator from sports and outline it, the way Merlin 
Olsen does it on Sunday." As a bonus, he decided to report from the scene 
himself, "live and in stereo." Yes, and don't forget the marching band. 
</P>
<P>
If not for Cole's controlled work as Killian and the stylized look of "Midnight 
Caller," the series would be almost comic. By each week framing Killian as a 
flawless, problem-solving, zooming-to-the-rescue super hero, it squanders an 
opportunity to make an important statement about the unique connection between 
radio talk-show hosts of all stripes and their listeners. 
</P>
<P>
Devon King briefly makes a pass at it, saying: "Jack gives people a sense of 
community. With Jack, there's a shared experience." 
</P>
<P>
But Barry Champlain says it far better with his hostile give-and-take on the 
air and by stealing Alan Berg's line about talk radio being "the last 
neighborhood in town." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some neighborhoods have a way of blowing up.

<P>
BYRDS TURN ON THE OLD MEMORY MACHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Byrds watchers certainly got their memories' worth Wednesday night at the Coach 
House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
The brief, three-city Byrds mini-reunion tour -- which concludes tonight at the 
sold-out Ventura Theatre in Ventura -- was prompted more by legal reasons than 
sentimental ones. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the original members -- Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman 
-- are doing the shows to establish their legal right to the group name, thus 
preventing anyone else (including other original members, Gene Clark and 
Michael Clarke) from calling themselves the Byrds. 
</P>
<P>
Once they took the stage, however, McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman were 
enthusiastic musicians, not legal strategists, and it was hard to imagine 
anyone who was ever touched by the Byrds' music not being moved. 
</P>
<P>
In their first formal concert appearance together in 15 years, the threesome 
(backed by drummer Steve Duncan and guitarist John Jorgenson from Hillman's 
Desert Rose Band) played with a spirit and desire that kept the evening from 
turning into merely a casual exercise in nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
The material ranged from endearing versions of some of the Byrds' most famous 
numbers -- from Bob Dylan songs such as "Mr. Tambourine Man" and "My Back 
Pages" to such originals as "Mr. Spaceman" and "Eight Miles High." 
</P>
<P>
In between, McGuinn and Crosby -- especially -- reminisced good-naturedly about 
the old days, including how they happened to write or record some of the key 
numbers, Crosby admitting he hated "Mr. Tambourine Man" the first time he heard 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Though the Byrds have often been saluted for their musical innovations (the 
wonderfully appealing, guitar-accented blend of country, folk and rock 
strains), the musicians also played a major role in the '60s in making rock 'n' 
roll safe for serious themes. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, they leaned toward material that deserved to be called 
artful -- though no one at the time took rock seriously enough to even think of 
applying that term to anything that appeared on a 45-rpm single. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly three decades later, the songs -- which reflect on personal and social 
concerns -- take on an even more poignant and graceful ring for longtime Byrds 
fans, because they can be viewed in the wider context of changes in both the 
fans' lives and in the lives of the musicians themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Consider "Mr. Tambourine Man," the group's first (1965) hit: 
</P>
<P>
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to 
</P>
<P>
 Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me 
</P>
<P>
 In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see now that the Byrds were pop tambourine men themselves. The 
guitars had a jingle-jangle flavor, and there was a sense of adventure in the 
songs and in the disarming harmonies that made the Byrds seem to be leading you 
on a journey as magical at times as the one offered by the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
But it was equally affecting Wednesday to hear the trio sing "Chimes of 
Freedom," another Dylan song from the Byrds' first album: 
</P>
<P>
 Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed 
</P>
<P>
 For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse 
</P>
<P>
 An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe 
</P>
<P>
 ... we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the youthful optimism of "Tambourine Man," this song is a salute to 
survival -- a tune that seemed a fitting tribute to the way McGuinn, Crosby and 
Hillman have survived with their musical integrity and determination intact. 
</P>
<P>
McGuinn was the primary force behind the Byrds, and he led the band with 
distinction until 1973, bringing in worthy new musicians (including Clarence 
White and Gram Parsons) to replace those who had left. After the Byrds, Hillman 
went on to be a valuable figure in several other teamings, including the Flying 
Burrito Brothers and, now, Desert Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby has probably enjoyed the most success (as part of Crosby, Stills, Nash 
and Young) and notoriety (the much publicized drug-related personal problems 
that landed him in a Texas prison a few years ago). He has rebounded in recent 
months with a new CSNY album, an acclaimed autobiography and a solo album that 
is due to be released at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
For Gary Bagnall, 31, seeing them together again was a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
"The Byrds were just a generation ahead of me," said the Costa Mesa animal 
importer before the concert. "I've always loved their music, but I never saw 
them live and I didn't think they'd ever get together again. So, I couldn't 
believe it when I saw the ad. I went straight to the phone to make 
reservations." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Cobb, 34, San Clemente, was especially eager to see Crosby, whom he sees 
as an inspiring survivor. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the Byrds music, but Crosby is special. . . . It's an inspiration to 
see how he has pulled himself out of all that." 
</P>
<P>
After the concert, the musicians seemed equally excited. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt great," said McGuinn, standing in the club's upstairs dressing room. 
"We only had one day's rehearsal and you never know how it's going to be. You 
can't assume it's going to sound good just because it did years ago. But it 
felt right almost immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Added Crosby, "We came off the stage laughing and hugging each other. When we 
got together (for a 15-minute set last summer) at the Wiltern Theatre, it made 
me realize how much fun it is to sing with these guys." 
</P>
<P>
They haven't thought about more than this week's three shows, but Crosby and 
McGuinn seemed so enthused by the concert that they weren't ruling out doing 
additional dates. 
</P>
<P>
One additional appearance is certain. 
</P>
<P>
Because the debut album was released 25 years ago, the Byrds are eligible to be 
inducted next year in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame -- and their election is a 
cinch. 
</P>
<P>
"That's another reason to get this name settled," Hillman said. "I'd hate to 
see 29 guys stand up (when they call the Byrds name)."

'CYNIC'S CHOICE' TO MOVE TO KSRF, KOCM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McDOUGAL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A listeners' crusade has rescued "Cynic's Choice," a 20-year-old Sunday comedy 
fixture at KFAC-AM (1330), from oblivion with the announcement Thursday that 
the weekly program will continue to air in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Stations KSRF-FM (103.1) in Santa Monica and KOCM-FM (103.1) in Newport Beach, 
both owned by Radio Broadcasters Inc., will begin airing the two-hour British 
comedy revue at its old time of 10 a.m., each Sunday, beginning Jan. 15 
"without losing a beat," said Malcolm Berman, KSRF's commercial development 
director. 
</P>
<P>
"I had worked for KFAC for about 8 1/2 years before coming to KSRF, so I was 
very familiar with the show," Berman said. "It seemed like a natural hookup to 
bring it over to KSRF, since our station is located in Santa Monica, which is 
sort of the hotbed of British culture in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Brian Clewer, the creator and host of "Cynic's Choice," believed 
his show had finally lost its franchise with KFAC-AM's sale to a broadcast 
group that intends to switch from its current classical music format on Jan. 
14. The new KFAC-AM format will consist of several foreign-language programs, 
ranging from Japanese to Filipino, but British comedy will not be part of the 
new ethnic mix. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 letters came to The Times, prompting a Tuesday article on 
Clewer's dilemma that was, in turn, rewritten by several London tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
"I got outraged calls from the London Evening Standard and the Daily Mail and 
this morning I got calls from (London-based) Capital Radio, BBC One and BBC 
Four," Clewer said Thursday. "They all wanted to know what on earth 
(broadcasters) were doing to British expatriates in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Clewer said the final KFAC broadcast of "Cynic's Choice" will be this Sunday 
before the move to Santa Monica next week. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, he has had to move his off-the-air business to Santa Monica in 
recent weeks as well. For many years, Clewer has operated a record and video 
retail business, specializing in British recordings, out of the Ambassador 
Hotel in Los Angeles. Last week, the venerable Ambassador shut down after more 
than 50 years of operation and so did its collection of boutiques. Clewer's new 
Santa Monica location is a few blocks from KSRF. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning a big welcome party for 'Cynic's Choice' at one of the English 
pubs on Santa Monica Boulevard," said KSRF's Berman. He said the new addition 
will replace adult contemporary music that is currently programmed Sunday 
mornings on both stations. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we'll be in FM stereo too," Clewer said. "That means I can 
exercise my schizophrenia to the fullest."

TV REMAKES 'AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BART MILLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cavernous ballroom of the Institution of Civil Engineers off London's 
Parliament Square might be a little oversized to represent the lounge of a 
transatlantic sailing vessel of the 1870s. Luckily, the ceiling mural depicting 
the heroism of Britain's construction industry, complete with burly nymphs 
wrapped in the Union Jack, won't be in the shot. The camera was focused at deck 
level on Pierce Brosnan impersonating David Niven -- er, Phileas Fogg. 
</P>
<P>
A lavish television remake of Mike Todd's -- er, Jules Verne's -- "Around the 
World in Eighty Days" was getting under way in London and points east, aiming 
for a six-hour rendezvous on NBC next April. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from new miniseries king Brosnan as the peripatetic Fogg, this "Around 
the World" version stars Eric Idle as his fussy French valet Passepartout, 
Julia Nickson as Fogg's Indian love interest and Peter Ustinov as Detective 
Fix, who pursues the eccentric travelers, convinced that they have robbed the 
Bank of England. 
</P>
<P>
The $16-million production (two-thirds NBC money, one-third from Europe) is 
studiously avoiding copying anything in the hit 1956 movie, except its gimmick 
of casting recognizable faces in small roles. When showman Todd credited such 
bit-part stars as Frank Sinatra using their portraits in oval frames, he 
invented "cameos." 
</P>
<P>
Cameo artistes this time around include Lee Remick, Robert Morley, Robert 
Wagner, Pernell Roberts, John Mills, Christopher Lee, Patrick Macnee, John 
Hillerman, Roddy McDowall and David Soul. Morley and Mills are the only 
repeaters from the 1956 film. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the one-scene players will be impersonating historical figures such as 
Sarah Bernhardt, Louis Pasteur, Queen Victoria and Jesse James. The script is 
full of fantastic inventions from the 1870s, such as an early dirigible and a 
sort of armored personnel carrier in which the travelers traverse the American 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
No, this isn't a docudrama. "It's fantasy time," Brosnan said. "The writer, 
John Gay, has taken plenty of artistic license. When it comes to Jules Verne, 
it's not hallowed ground we're treading on." In any case, the book is in the 
public domain. 
</P>
<P>
Although the scene Buzz Kulik was directing here in the civil engineers' 
ballroom was meant to represent the last leg of Fogg's globe-girdling 
adventure, it was one of the first scenes to be shot. In fact, as Brosnan 
spoke, he was preparing to go on camera as Fogg for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"Fogg is something of an enigma to me," the actor said. "I'll discover what 
makes him tick over the next few months. 'Tick' is the right word, I suppose, 
because he's a man who lives his life by the clock. His wardrobe is numbered so 
he can wear his clothes in the proper sequence. He's very polished, very 
precise, but slightly off-beam in some respects. 
</P>
<P>
"David Niven was wonderful -- though I find watching the film now a little too 
much for one sitting. In its day it must have been thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
Since the film isn't still a crowd-pleaser, a remake might seem a chancy 
proposition, and co-producer Renee Valente confirmed that "The network didn't 
want to do this show when we first proposed it six years ago. At that time, we 
were thinking of Michael Caine or Roger Moore for Fogg. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at the network then didn't like the idea of a period piece. So we 
contemporized it. Instead of Phileas Fogg wagering at a game of whist that he 
could make the trip in 80 days, we had him betting on tennis. Luckily, no one 
wanted to do it that way, and neither did we. We prefer the idea of doing it in 
period but with performances that aren't dated. The comedy especially has to 
reflect current audience taste." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ustinov agrees that the 1956 original is dated. "It's peculiar to see the 
film now on television," he said. "Owing to the film process they used, 
vertical black bars appear on the TV screen. It looks like a Hershey product." 
</P>
<P>
Ustinov, too, was shooting his first scene, a comical exchange with Brosnan, as 
propmen caused the ship's chandelier to sway behind them. Of his character, 
Ustinov said, "Fix is dogged yet confused, aggressive yet defensive, blustering 
and retracting it at the same time, thinking he's mastered the devious workings 
of the criminal mind, as if there were only one." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Newton played Fix in 1956 after Ustinov himself just missed getting the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
"I was supposed to do it," he said, "but I was preempted by 20th Century-Fox, 
where I was under contract. Fox were doing all they could to torpedo Todd 
because they'd just staked a lot of money on CinemaScope, and Todd's picture 
used a similar wide-screen process. I eventually got out of my Fox contract, 
but too late."

INVESTORS MAY REGRET DITCHING MUTUAL FUNDS

Investors who fled stock mutual funds last year have full reason to regret it: 
Final results for 1988 show that equity funds posted an above-average year, 
beating their more conservative bond and income fund counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
General equity funds posted an average 14.47% return in 1988, beating their 
compound average annual growth rate of 13.48% over the past 15 years, according 
to Lipper Analytical Services, a Summit, N.J., firm that tracks fund 
performance.

<P>
That gain came in a year when investors pulled out about $5 billion more from 
equity funds than they put in, according to statistics through November. Last 
year is expected to be the first since 1979 that equity funds suffered a net 
sales outflow. 
</P>
<P>
"In '88, investors were fighting '87's battles," said A. Michael Lipper, 
contending that investors were overly conservative last year, a result of 
lingering nightmares of the stock market crash and fears that the market would 
tumble further in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
However, not all the news for stock funds was good. Both for the full year and 
fourth quarter, equity funds on average were unable to beat the major stock 
indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which gained 16.55% for the year 
with dividends reinvested. 
</P>
<P>
Such under-performance occurred partly because many funds had high proportions 
of their portfolios in cash -- the result of their own somewhat conservative 
market outlooks, Lipper said. Also, the year's record takeover activity was 
concentrated in blue chip stocks, boosting disproportionately such blue 
chip-laden indexes as the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The top-performing group for the year included funds investing in small-company 
growth stocks, posting an 18.99% gain. That was a significant recovery from the 
year before, when they were the worst-performing group among general equity 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
All but five stock and bond fund groups posted double-digit gains, and only 
one, gold funds, posted a loss. These funds, which invest in stocks of gold 
mining firms and in the metal itself, plummeted 14.54% for the year after 
posting the best returns among all groups in 1987 with a 35.66% average gain. 
</P>
<P>
Bond and income funds -- the type that invest predominantly in bonds and other 
fixed-income securities -- posted a respectable year. The largest group, 
fixed-income funds, gained 7.91% for the year and 0.90% for the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth quarter, however, stock funds posted more modest gains. General 
equity funds posted a 1.42% advance. International funds, which invest in 
foreign stocks, were the top performers in the October-December period. Aided 
by the falling dollar, which increased the value of overseas securities, 
international funds rose 9.37%. They dominated the list of top-performing funds 
for the quarter, taking all of the top 10 spots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Funds Ahead 
</P>
<P>
Funds investing in the rip-roaring Japanese stock market -- which posted record 
highs during the quarter, gaining about 8% -- were among the biggest winners in 
the quarter. Among those Japanese-oriented funds was Merrill Lynch Pacific, the 
period's top performer with a 18.22% gain. Its portfolio was more than 80% 
invested in Japanese equities, including four property-casualty insurance 
companies that posted above-market returns, said Norman Harvey, senior vice 
president for Merrill Lynch Asset Management, which oversees the fund. The fund 
also wasn't hurt by a 7% gain in the yen versus the dollar, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts said investors should be cautious about jumping headlong into 
international funds for short-term gains, because the dollar's fall could 
reverse. Also, the biggest winners in one year or quarter -- because they tend 
to take the biggest risks -- often end up being the losers in the next quarter 
or year. 
</P>
<P>
"You're probably better off looking for funds with good long-term records which 
haven't been at the top recently but are under-performing a bit," said Joe 
Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago firm that tracks fund 
performance. Among such attractive funds, he suggested Evergreen Total Return, 
GIT Equity-Special Growth, Nicholas II, SoGen International and Strong Total 
Return. 
</P>
<P>
The volatility of top-performing funds was illustrated by the Kaufmann Fund, a 
small-company growth fund that was the year's top performer with a 58.57% 
return. But in the fourth quarter, it was the third-worst-performing fund, with 
a 8.26% loss. (It was among the worst performers in 1987 as well.) 
</P>
<P>
Kaufmann portfolio manager Lawrence Auriana attributed the poor quarter to a 
correction in a number of stocks that had done well earlier in the year. But 
the fact that the fund only invests in about 26 stocks also adds to its risk 
and volatility, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Good Year for Ethics 
</P>
<P>
Significant inclusions among the year's top 10 performers were two growth-stock 
funds that use ethical criteria for their investments. One, Parnassus Fund, 
which was up 42.44%, invests only in firms with "enlightened and progressive 
management," measured by such factors as sensitivity to communities they 
operate in and treatment of employees. 
</P>
<P>
The other, Calvert Ariel Growth, up 39.97% for the year, avoids firms involved 
in defense and nuclear power, and those with plants or people in South Africa, 
according to portfolio manager John W. Rogers Jr. 
</P>
<P>
None of the 10 largest stock funds, as measured by asset size, made the year's 
top 10 performance list. But seven of the 10 beat the S&amp;P 500. They 
included Fidelity Magellan (up 22.76%), Windsor (28.70%), Fidelity Puritan 
(18.89%), Fidelity Equity Income (22.49%), Templeton World (19.69%), Pioneer II 
(21.63%) and Washington Mutual Investors (17.66%). 
</P>
<P>
The top-performing bond or income fund was Convertible Securities and Income, 
with a gain of 36.24%. Convertible securities generally performed well during 
the year because their prices moved up with rises in common stocks and they 
paid generous dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Closed-end funds -- those whose shares are fixed in number and trade on stock 
exchanges -- enjoyed a sales boom in 1988. Share prices of the 20 largest 
diversified equity closed-end funds rose 16% in 1988, according to Thomas J. 
Herzfeld, a closed-end fund expert in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest loser for the year was American Asset Yield, a fund investing in 
both stocks and bonds with a 54.55% decline, which management has attributed to 
its small size and high expenses. Lipper Analytical listed the fund as the top 
performer for the quarter, but that was largely because the fund included in 
its return monies reimbursed to shareholders that had been previously taken in 
as expenses. Since that should be considered a return of investors' own money 
-- not gains from investing -- The Times removed the fund from the top 10 list 
for the quarter. (And without that reimbursement of expenses, the fund's 1988 
performance would be worse than that reported.) 
</P>
<P>
What is the outlook for 1989? Experts disagree on the direction of stocks for 
this year. But long term, investors should continue to keep some portion of 
their portfolio in stock funds, most experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
"On a longer-term basis, equities will produce a better result than 
fixed-income securities," Lipper said.

TRADEMARK FIASCO MEANS NEW TOYOTA MAY REMAIN NAMELESS

It was bizarre. One moment last Friday afternoon, staffers at Lexus -- Toyota's 
new luxury car division -- were cheerfully getting ready to leave Toyota's 
American headquarters in Torrance for the long New Year's holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, they found themselves scrambling to hide or erase all public mention 
anywhere in the United States of the name Lexus. 
</P>
<P>
The switch came at 5 o'clock that afternoon Eastern time -- 2 p.m. in Los 
Angeles. A federal judge in New York stunned Toyota by ruling against the giant 
Japanese auto maker in a trademark infringement lawsuit brought by Mead Corp., 
which markets Lexis, a computerized information service that provides legal 
data, mostly for attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Month to Appeal 
</P>
<P>
The judge threw a legal thunderbolt at Toyota by ruling that it had infringed 
on Mead's Lexis trademark and immediately ordered that it not use the name 
Lexus in any manner. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, however, Toyota won a decision temporarily allowing it to resume 
using the Lexus name in some circumstances. On Thursday, an appeals court 
extended the decision for a month. Without the extension, Toyota would have 
been forced to drop all public references to Lexus starting today. 
</P>
<P>
Until Thursday's ruling, Toyota had found itself on a weeklong roller-coaster 
ride, desperately trying to stitch together some alternate way to keep its new 
luxury car operation in business without publicly uttering its name. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Toyota had already spent $12 million to make Lexus a household word by the 
time its high-priced models appear next fall. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday afternoon, all of that had to be undone. "We had an emergency plan 
that we had to go to," said Jim Perkins, Lexus senior vice president, on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Receptionists were quickly told to stop using the name Lexus, and instead to 
answer the phone with, "Hello, Toyota's luxury car division." 
</P>
<P>
Lexus ads were pulled around the country. Only a few, including some in Los 
Angeles, couldn't be canceled in time. 
</P>
<P>
But that was just the start; two major press conferences introducing the Lexus 
line to the world were scheduled for this week at auto show previews in Detroit 
and Los Angeles. So Toyota officials had to count the number of times the Lexus 
name was mentioned in its auto show displays -- 26 in all -- just in case a 
court delay was not won and they all had to be covered up. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota public relations officials even had to figure out how to slice off the 
Lexus name from press kits to be handed out to reporters at the auto shows. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, if the three-day delay had not been extended, Toyota would have 
introduced its luxury cars at the auto shows without a nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
The worst time for Lexus came last weekend. Toyota's attorneys couldn't get in 
touch with a federal appeals judge until Monday to issue a delay. "From Friday 
until Monday, we went through a period where we would have been in violation of 
the order if we had publicly used the Lexus name," Perkins told reporters at 
the press preview for Lexus at the Detroit auto show. 
</P>
<P>
So, right after last Friday's order, Toyota suppliers were immediately called 
and told not to use the Lexus name publicly. Even the contractor making signs 
for Lexus dealerships was put on notice; he was told he could continue work 
only if he left a space where the Lexus name was supposed to go. 
</P>
<P>
Now, even with the monthlong stay in the order, Toyota is still banned from any 
national advertising. It can only promote the Lexus line in local ads run in 
conjunction with regional auto shows. The company has thus had to drop any 
further plans to advertise in USA Today and the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Alternative Names 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite this week's identity crisis, Toyota executives say they still don't 
have any alternative names lined up if they lose in court. Changing the name is 
still out of the question, according to Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had an alternative name in mind, you wouldn't go ahead with an appeal," 
Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the company did not develop alternate names earlier during the 
Mead case -- the lawsuit was first filed last April -- because Toyota was 
already committed to the name, and had spent too much money to back off. 
</P>
<P>
And, while Toyota first heard complaints from Mead in October, 1987, Toyota did 
nothing to develop alternate names before the suit was filed, he said. Instead, 
Toyota negotiated with Mead, and thought it was close to reaching a deal with 
Mead early in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the prudent things," Perkins insisted. After Mead first complained to 
Toyota, Toyota rechecked its legal research on the name, Perkins said, and the 
company felt confident that it was not in violation of any trademark laws. "We 
did everything right with this name. It just shows you, anybody can sue you for 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Yet if Toyota ultimately loses in court, Perkins apparently will become the 
first man to run a car company with no name. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an alternate plan now that wouldn't involve a name," for the 
franchise, Perkins said Thursday. Apparently, the two cars to be sold by Lexus 
this fall would temporarily be known only by their model names -- the LS 400 
and ES 250 -- without any brand identity. A new name would have to be developed 
at that time, Perkins acknowledged -- and as quickly as possible.

NATIONAL MEDICAL TO SPIN OFF HILLHAVEN CORP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Medical Enterprises, resorting to a popular corporate technique to 
boost shareholder value, said Thursday that it plans to spin off its troubled 
nursing home subsidiary, the Hillhaven Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The bid to split off the nation's second-largest nursing home chain to existing 
NME shareholders "should benefit" them because "the marketplace will evaluate 
the long-term care operations separately from our acute and specialty hospital 
business after the spinoff," Richard K. Eamer, NME's chairman and chief 
executive, said. 
</P>
<P>
The Hillhaven Corp., based in Tacoma, Wash., ranks behind Pasadena-based 
Beverly Enterprises. It operates 349 nursing facilities with more than 43,000 
beds in 37 states. But belt-tightening in government-funded Medicaid and 
Medicare programs have hurt its profitability in recent years. Nursing homes 
derive a major portion of their revenue from Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
This new austere financial climate has prompted some health-care firms to spin 
off under-performing subsidiaries to increase shareholder values. The stock 
distributions involved are ordinarily not taxable to the parent firm or 
shareholders, and the transaction can mask the impact of an under-performing 
unit on its parent if the unit were sold outright. 
</P>
<P>
"When you spin a company off, it becomes someone else's problem," said Jerry 
Balter, a health-care analyst at the San Francisco in vestment house Robertson, 
Colman &amp; Stephens. "If (NME) sold (Hillhaven) outright, (it) would probably 
have to take a major loss. This way it will have a delayed impact." 
</P>
<P>
NME, which owns and manages 37 acute-care general hospitals with about 6,700 
licensed beds, will issue current NME stockholders additional shares in the 
newly independent Hillhaven unit. 
</P>
<P>
Although NME's long-term care facilities account for 32% of NME's revenue, they 
contribute only 12% of the profits. By comparison, NME's general and specialty 
hospitals -- which account for 41% and 27% of revenue, respectively -- 
contribute 46% and 42% of profits. 
</P>
<P>
NME anticipates that, after shareholder distribution, the common stock of the 
Hillhaven Corp. will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and that the 
company will have annual revenue of about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
NME officials would not say what effect the spinoff might have on NME's bottom 
line. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure of NME's plan, which is subject to government approval, came as 
the company announced record earnings for its second quarter ended Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
NME said second-quarter revenue rose 16% to $894.6 million and net income 
climbed 8% to $47.3 million from a year ago. In a prepared statement, Eamer 
attributed the improvements to "the strong performance" of NME's specialty 
hospitals.

J.C. Penney Co. said it has hired Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., a financial 
adviser, to help it "explore alternatives" for its Telaction Corp. 
home-shopping subsidiary. Duncan Muir, a Penney spokesman, said the options 
might include selling the operation or bringing in investors. "The purpose of 
this is to see what direction we go in to make this a commercially feasible 
project," he said, adding that the venture has already cost Penney $85 million. 
The service, an interactive television marketing system, is now available to 
more than 25,000 Chicago-area homes with cable.

U.S. oil companies plan to increase exploration spending in 1989 and many are 
particularly focusing on more investment in natural gas drilling, according to 
an industry survey by Salomon Bros. The survey also found that although major 
U.S. oil companies are planning a general increase in exploration and 
production spending, less money will go toward drilling in the United States.

A temporary suspension on debt payments announced over the weekend by Venezuela 
President Jaime Lusinchi will probably be extended to include the second 
quarter and maybe even the full year, foreign bankers said. Such an extension 
could result in the nation postponing up to $1.532 billion of its $31-billion 
international debt, they said. A telex that Venezuela sent to banks over the 
weekend said the country would suspend payments from Jan. 17 to March 31.

CONTRACEPTION R&amp;D FALLS OUT OF FAVOR; 
</P>
<P>
OF U.S. FIRMS, ONLY ORTHO CONTINUES RESEARCHING NEW METHODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fearful of lawsuits, troubled by attacks from interest groups and worried about 
the bottom line, all but one major American drug company have stopped 
large-scale research into new kinds of contraception, a trend that many experts 
say is leaving women and men with limited choices in birth control. 
</P>
<P>
Among the large firms, only Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. of Raritan, N.J., 
maintains an in-depth research program into new contraceptive technologies, 
compared to eight major corporations in the early 1970s, according to data 
provided by the Allen Guttmacher Institute, a research organization in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
"It's already made a difference," said Dr. Wayne Bardin, vice president of the 
Population Council, a Manhattan-based nonprofit research group. "There are 
already incredibly fewer products in the pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
Ortho is working on easier, longer-lasting ways to deliver hormones like those 
now contained in birth control pills -- through nasal delivery, injections, 
patches and other methods, according to Rich Salem, a spokesman for the Johnson 
&amp; Johnson subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only have we not abandoned the area, but we have a very aggressive 
research and development program to discover and produce new contraceptive 
products," Salem said. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the efforts of Ortho, the public sector and perhaps a dozen small 
firms, most observers say research and new types of contraceptives coming into 
the market have dropped off in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We can spend money developing products, but eventually to make the products 
available to the public, we have to entice manufacturers to do so," said Dr. 
Henry Gabelnick, director of extramural programs and product development of the 
Eastern Virginia Medical School's Contraceptive Research and Development 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"It ends up with things that have reached a certain point and are ready to be 
tested more widely sitting on the shelf," said Gabelnick, whose program is 
funded entirely by the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
</P>
<P>
Family planning advocates say the dearth of research limits the options for 
both men and women who are dissatisfied with current birth control choices. 
</P>
<P>
Half of women are not happy with their current method of birth control, Bardin 
said. That discontent is in part because of side-effects that accompany oral 
contraceptives and relatively high failure rates among diaphragms, IUDs, 
condoms and other methods. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no contraceptive that's satisfactory for everybody, and so you find 
some women who aren't served satisfactorily by any of them," Bardin said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Simpler Methods Needed 
</P>
<P>
The effects of the research cuts are seen in high relief among women and men 
who choose surgical sterilization as a method of birth control, often for lack 
of a better option, according to Bardin. 
</P>
<P>
Sterilization is the most widely used form of birth control among women aged 
15-44 who are sexually active, use contraception and are not trying to become 
pregnant, according to figures provided by the Alan Guttmacher Institute. In 
1987, one third of those women -- or 13.8 million -- were either sterilized 
themselves or had sexual partners who had been sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, according to a 1982 survey, 10% of U.S. couples protected by vasectomy or 
tubal ligation said they would now want to undo the procedure if surgical 
reversal were completely safe. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a concern about the early age at which sterilization is accepted," 
Bardin said. 
</P>
<P>
Simpler, more durable methods of birth control would be particularly useful for 
teen-agers, who often use no contraception at all. About 96 out of 1,000 
teen-aged girls in the United States get pregnant each year, according to Dr. 
Louise Tyrer, vice president for medical affairs at the Planned Parenthood 
Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the group that really needs to be reached with contraception," Tyrer 
said, adding that available types of birth control are just one factor 
explaining the high pregnancy rate. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, most current birth control devices and drugs focus on women, 
instead of men who might benefit from injectable hormones or other long-lasting 
technologies. "We need better methods for women, but I think even more 
importantly they need some reasonably modern methods for men," said Dr. Philip 
Corfman, supervisory medical officer for fertility and maternal health drugs at 
the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The major drug companies give a number of reasons for pulling out of 
contraceptive research programs. 
</P>
<P>
G. D. Searle &amp; Co. of Skokie, Ill., pulled its IUDs off the shelves in 1986 
but continues to manufacture birth control pills. The firm dropped its IUD line 
largely because of what the company considered unwarranted lawsuits that 
followed the uproar over A. H. Robbins' Dalkon Shield. "It is not conducive to 
making you think of developing new things in an area where there is so much 
interest in litigation," said Kay Bruno, Searle's senior director of public 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Syntex Corp., based in Palo Alto, Calif., is another manufacturer of oral 
contraceptives that no longer does extensive research in birth control 
technologies. "It's more a matter of looking at how well is the oral 
contraceptive population served," said spokeswoman Linda Thomas, who added that 
the company feels women are well-served by existing products. 
</P>
<P>
A number of American companies say they can rely on new technologies licensed 
from European firms, while U.S. corporations concentrate on cardiovascular and 
other drugs. "There's no need to duplicate it here," said Marshall E. Malloy, 
manager of media relations for Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
But other observers find more complex reasons for the shift away from 
contraceptive research. 
</P>
<P>
Roderick Mackenzie, former president of Ortho and current chairman of 
GynoPharma Inc. of Somerville, N.J., which recently introduced a new IUD, said 
the root of the problem is scientific. He argued that the important 
developments in birth control technology came from a few major scientific 
breakthroughs. The first was the invention of the IUD; the second was the 
discovery of inexpensive ways to manufacture hormones used in the pill, and, 
third, the realization that copper enhances IUD performance. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of RU-486, the so-called abortion pill recently introduced 
in France, there has been no other major innovation to guide companies' basic 
research efforts, Mackenzie said. "When you're funding research, you have to 
have a plan for where it might take you." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Huge Damage Awards 
</P>
<P>
As the companies lost their sense of direction, they put basic research funds 
into other fields, creating a "vicious circle," Mackenzie said. Even Ortho, he 
added, does less research than it did 10 years ago, although the company 
spokesman Salem said Ortho remains committed to female medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the scientific problems in contraceptive research were legal and 
social troubles that discouraged active laboratory work. 
</P>
<P>
The Dalkon Shield, which drove Richmond, Va.-based A. H. Robbins out of 
business, made pharmaceutical and insurance companies wary of the huge damages 
awarded in drug liability cases. "The reason the major companies have pulled 
out is quite simple: dollars," said Gabelnick of CONRAD. "They are afraid to 
take the risks because of the giant lawsuits that have come up." 
</P>
<P>
Even producers of safe products found themselves fearful of litigation, a 
situation that clashed with the drug companies' desire to be seen as providers 
of good health.

LEBOW ASKS PRIME TO PROVE ITS WORTH

Bennett S. LeBow, who has pursued Prime Computer with a $970-million hostile 
takeover bid, Thursday challenged the Natick, Mass., company to prove it is 
worth more and repeated that he might negotiate a higher bid. 
</P>
<P>
LeBow, chairman of Tustin-based MAI Basic Four, said his company would 
"seriously consider" raising the cash offer if it got information from Prime 
"that demonstrates that such an increase is warranted." 
</P>
<P>
The new overture from LeBow was contained in a letter to Prime executives dated 
Wednesday that offered a confidentiality agreement in return for information 
about Prime. LeBow released the letter Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Prime declined to comment on the letter. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market apparently shrugged off LeBow's latest statement. Prime stock 
gained 25 cents to close $18.625 a share in trading Thursday. MAI's buyout 
offer amounts to $20 a share. 
</P>
<P>
John Adams, an analyst for Adams Harness &amp; Hill in Boston, said LeBow's 
offer to go higher had a "Catch-22" in that Prime has all along resisted the 
deal.

WYSE TO LAY OFF 560; PRESIDENT RESIGNS

Wyse Technology Inc., struggling in the fiercely competitive market for 
IBM-compatible personal computers, announced Thursday the resignation of 
President and Chief Operating Officer Phillip E. White and disclosed plans to 
dismiss about 560 workers. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose, Calif.-based company also said it expects to report a loss for 
the nine months ended Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Tse, chairman and chief executive of Wyse, will assume White's 
day-to-day responsibilities at the computer manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
White, who joined Wyse in 1986, left to become chief executive of Informix 
Corp., a database management and software products company based in Menlo Park, 
but will remain on Wyse's board. 
</P>
<P>
"White is extremely good and competent, but he became frustrated at Wyse 
because it is in a bad situation that's going to get worse" because of stiff 
competition, said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock 
Letter. 
</P>
<P>
Wyse has a good distribution outlet through BusinessLand, Murphy said, but 
needs to diversify its product line and come up with a clone of International 
Business Machine's more advanced personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they will cut more jobs," Murphy said. "They have to do some serious 
strategic reorienting. I wouldn't be surprised to see them shut down some 
product lines." 
</P>
<P>
Wyse built a lucrative business selling computer display terminals, but its 
efforts to translate that success into the market for complete PCs has largely 
failed, other analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Wyse said it would slash the 560 jobs -- about 15% of its work force -- through 
cutbacks and attrition in reaction to a sharp decline in third-quarter sales. 
The company said the reduction includes about 400 positions in its Far East 
manufacturing operations. 
</P>
<P>
Wyse said sales in the third quarter ended Dec. 30 would be between $60 million 
to $70 million. That is less than half what it forecast in early October, 
computer analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
It said a loss in the quarter would wipe out profits of $11.7 million, or 78 
cents a share, earned in the first six months. 
</P>
<P>
Wyse's shares closed down $1.00 at $6.625 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Computer analysts blamed the company's problems on several factors -- lack of 
PC expertise, a late entry into the field and initial quality problems.

BILZERIAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FRAUD CHARGES

Takeover speculator and Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian, indicted last 
month on 12 counts of fraud, pleaded not guilty Thursday and said that he hopes 
to clear his name and resume hunting for companies to buy. 
</P>
<P>
"My role going forward was to have been, and should still be, to look for 
further acquisitions," Bilzerian told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old financier, known for his bulging mustache and casual open-shirt 
dress, wore a dark business suit and tie to his arraignment in Manhattan 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
His lawyer, Arthur Mathews, told reporters, "Mr. Bilzerian is innocent. It's 
unfortunate these charges were brought. It's burdensome to defend them, but 
they will be defended and he will be vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Singer Not Involved 
</P>
<P>
After Bilzerian entered his plea, he was ordered to entrust his passport to 
Mathews. He was freed on a $500,000 personal recognizance bond pending trial, 
scheduled for May 1 before U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward. The trial is 
expected to last six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Bilzerian was indicted Dec. 21 by a federal grand jury on a dozen felony counts 
linked to four failed takeover situations in 1985 and '86. The charges are part 
of a network of securities fraud prosecutions tracing indirectly back to the 
Ivan F. Boesky insider trading scandal that broke more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
None of the charges relate to Bilzerian's takeover of Singer, a defense 
contractor he acquired a year ago for $1.06 billion after a protracted 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
That takeover marked Bilzerian's first major acquisition, and he has since been 
selling off parts of the company. Bilzerian told reporters Thursday that his 
indictment is "really not having any impact on Singer." 
</P>
<P>
A former real estate speculator who resides in Tampa, Fla., Bilzerian is one of 
the most prominent figures to be implicated thus far in an expanding federal 
crackdown on securities trading abuse. 
</P>
<P>
He was accused in the indictment of a pattern of violations that helped him 
amass millions of dollars in wealth through hostile takeover maneuvering aided 
in part by Jefferies &amp; Co., a Los Angeles brokerage that allegedly bought 
stock on Bilzerian's behalf under a secret, illegal arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The companies allegedly targeted by Bilzerian were Hammermill Paper Co., H. H. 
Robertson Co., Cluett Peabody &amp; Co. and Armco Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence for the indictment was partly supplied by Boyd L. Jefferies, founder 
of the Jefferies brokerage, who himself was implicated in securities fraud in 
early 1987 by Boesky, the now-imprisoned inside trader who turned state's 
evidence in exchange for lenient treatment.

SALES OF U.S.-MADE CARS RISE HEALTHY 6% IN '88 
</P>

<P>
Hurt by stronger Japanese and German currencies that forced up prices in this 
country, sales of imported cars dropped by 2.9% in 1988, while U.S.-built 
models showed a robust 6% rise, the auto industry reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Total new car sales in the United States rose 3.3% from 1987, but the imports' 
share of the market shrank to 28.9% from 30.8%. 
</P>
<P>
The yearly totals were helped by a strong 4.2% sales gain in December, with 
domestic sales up 11.7% and imports off 10%. Domestic sales were especially 
robust in the last 10 days of December, with sales up a whopping 29.9% from a 
relatively weak Dec. 21-31 period of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the surge in domestic sales appears to signal a major victory for 
the Big Three auto makers in their long battle with the imports. 
</P>
<P>
"Import prices have gone up, and quality has improved on the domestic side," 
said Thomas O'Grady, an industry analyst at Integrated Automotive Resources in 
Wayne, Pa. "This has narrowed the gap and has made domestics and imports more 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
But analysts noted that some of the increase in domestic sales is accounted for 
by production of Japanese cars at plants in the United States. These cars are 
counted as domestic models in industry statistics. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., which has expanded production at its Kentucky plant, 
recorded a 60.8% rise in sales last year. Honda of America had an 18.3% sales 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Big Three auto makers, Chrysler had the greatest sales increase -- up 
10.1% from 1987. The other two -- Ford and General Motors -- saw increases of 
8.8% and 2.1%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Has a Good Year 
</P>
<P>
"(Chrysler) had a lot of changeover last year," he said, explaining that 
Chrysler had retooled two plants in order to produce a redesigned New Yorker 
and the new Dynasty model. "This year they . . . gained back production as well 
as new car lines. They actually should do even better in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Executives from the U.S. companies said they were pleased with the 1988 
results, and they forecast greater gains in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"For the whole year, sales were satisfactory," Chrysler President Bob Lutz 
said. "Chrysler had a good year in 1988; this was the first time we sold a 
million cars and trucks each. We're looking for a good 1989." 
</P>
<P>
Truck sales provided a significant boost for the Big Three. Domestic truck 
sales leaped 10.3% in 1988. Imports, on the hand, dropped 19.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Total truck sales rose 4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Two pickup trucks, the Ford F Series and Chevrolet's CK Series, were the top 
sellers of 1988, with sales of 539,432 and 472,251, respectively. The Ford 
Escort, with sales of 387,815 last year, was the most popular individual model.

CAPITAL CITIES MAKES A BID FOR SATELLITE MUSIC

<TEXT>
<P>
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., New York, has acquired the equivalent of a 14.3% stake 
in Satellite Music Network Inc., Dallas, and has made a $5.40-a-share 
acquisition offer to Satellite's board. 
</P>
<P>
According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Capital 
Cities made an oral bid to Satellite's board and said it has no present 
intention to make a tender offer if the board rejects its $5.40-a-share offer. 
</P>
<P>

NO-INTEREST LOANS TO REPAIR RENTALS OFFERED

<TEXT>
<P>
To encourage owners of rental property to make improvements, the city's Housing 
and Neighborhood Development Department is offering 5-year loans with no 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
The loans, part of Garden Grove's rental-rehabilitation program, can be 
deferred for 5 years with no monthly payments. But the property owner is 
required to match the amount of the loan dollar for dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Typical improvements that qualify for the loans include interior and exterior 
painting, roof and eaves replacement, and electrical and plumbing repairs. A 
city inspection of the property is required before loans are approved, and some 
loans will be given priority based on where the property is located. 
</P>
<P>
More information is available by telephoning the Housing and Neighborhood 
Development Department at (714) 741-5143.

HUNTINGTON BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
KARATE EXPERT ACCUSED OF MOLESTING CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Huntington Beach karate expert, who at one time appeared on national 
television, was returned to Orange County this week to face 11 counts of child 
molestation and other charges, a month after his capture in Georgia, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
James A. Hydrick, 29, also faces charges of failing to register as a sex 
offender in the 1970s and assault and battery, stemming from an incident last 
August, an Orange County Municipal Court spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Hydrick's arraignment was rescheduled for Jan. 9, she said. He is 
being held in County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
According to Police Sgt. Bill Peterson, Hydrick allegedly molested three 
children, ranging in age from 10 to 15, from June to November last year. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1, Hydrick, who is also known as Zane Leopard, Sir James and James 
Schrock, was arrested in Augusta, Ga., on minor theft charges, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-2, 200-pound martial arts expert appeared on "That's Incredible" and 
"Ripley's Believe It or Not" during the early 1980s, moving objects with what 
he called psychic powers. He later admitted the feats were done through sleight 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
The self-described ninth-degree Black Belt also gained notoriety for his 
martial arts demonstrations.

CITY GOES BACK TO OLD AMBULANCE COMPANY

<TEXT>
<P>
The city is hoping to save a total of $200,000 in ambulance service costs this 
year by again contracting with an Anaheim company that had provided 27 previous 
years of emergency service, Fire Department Capt. Bob Wills said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Wills said that the Southland Ambulance Co., which provided emergency services 
before the city contracted with Medix Ambulance of Tustin last year, will save 
residents money because of lower rates. He said Garden Grove has about 4,500 
emergency service calls annually.

JUDGE REFUSES TO OUST MURDER TRIAL PROSECUTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Municipal Court judge on Thursday rejected an unusual attempt to have a 
prosecutor thrown off a case during a preliminary hearing for David A. Brown, a 
former Garden Grove businessman accused of masterminding his wife's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Joel Baruch, embroiled in a bitter courtroom feud with Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Jeoffrey Robinson, had accused Robinson of harassing and 
intimidating him to the point that he might not have been able to properly 
defend Brown. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Floyd H. Schenk, who has shown increasing frustration with the legal 
bickering that has dominated the Brown proceeding, denied Baruch's motion to 
have Robinson removed from the case. After a long hearing, Schenk rejected 
Baruch's allegations point by point. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charge that in 1985 Patricia A. Bailey, Brown's former 
sister-in-law and current wife, helped Brown plan the murder of Linda Brown, 
then his wife, and set up his 14-year-old daughter, Cinnamon, to take the 
blame. Bailey is expected to testify against Brown today. 
</P>
<P>
Cinnamon Brown has spent the last 3 years in a California Youth Authority 
facility for the murder but now claims that her father made her kill her 
stepmother. She is the prosecution's prime witness.

JUSTICES REJECT BID TO LIMIT PLEA TALKS TO OPEN COURTROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an appeal by the Orange County 
district attorney's office that sought to force Superior Court Judge Myron S. 
Brown to hold all plea negotiations in open court. 
</P>
<P>
The high court unanimously denied a hearing on District Attorney Cecil Hicks' 
appeal of a lower court's ruling that struck down the plea-bargain policy, 
saying that it violated the constitutional authority of judges to supervise 
case settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said his office still has other 
matters pending before the state Supreme Court that he hoped would result in 
striking down a new plea negotiation policy adopted by Brown. That new policy 
has been adopted by some judges in county Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Accused of Coercion 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana accused the 
district attorney of essentially coercing the judges into adopting his policy 
by refusing to let his prosecutors conduct such hearings in chambers. 
</P>
<P>
The appellate court ordered the judges to adopt their own policy and demanded 
that both the criminal defense attorneys in the county and the district 
attorney's office participate in forming the policy. 
</P>
<P>
Plea negotiations were almost always conducted in off-the-record, closed-door 
sessions in the past. But 2 years ago, Hicks ordered his prosecutors to sit in 
on such sessions only in open court. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys were upset by the lack of privacy that the district 
attorney's order mandated, but the judges told the defenders that they had no 
choice but to follow Hicks' policy. 
</P>
<P>
But after the appellate court ruling, Judge Brown, who operates the calendar 
courtroom for Superior Court and conducts most of the plea-bargain sessions, 
set up what he considered a compromise to both sides: 
</P>
<P>
* Serious felony cases, which all fall under Proposition 8, are all discussed 
in open court in Brown's so-called "sweater conferences" -- in which the judge 
sits, usually in a sweater, in the front of the courtroom with attorneys 
gathered around him. The sessions are in public view but out of earshot of 
anyone in the public seats. Brown, however, invites anyone from the public who 
wants to sit in on the sessions to do so; it is seldom that anyone does. 
</P>
<P>
(Among other things, Proposition 8, the so-called Victims Bill of Rights, a 
wide-ranging initiative approved by voters, limited plea bargaining in serious 
felony cases.) 
</P>
<P>
* Less serious felonies, considered non-Proposition 8 cases, are now discussed 
with Brown in chambers. 
</P>
<P>
But these in-chamber sessions are still different from the old closed-door 
sessions that preceded Hicks' policy. The new sessions are all on the record, 
meaning that a court reporter takes down everything said for a permanent 
record. Also, Brown invites anyone from the public to sit in on these sessions 
if they request to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Capizzi said these sessions are still not satisfactory to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been conducting the public's business in public for 2 years, and it's 
worked fine," Capizzi said. "We've not had cases backlogged like some people 
had predicted. We see no need to change it."

'WE HAD SEX; THAT'S NORMAL,' SAYS MAN OF 3 ALLEGED RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Fountain Valley businessman charged with raping three women and sexually 
assaulting two others told jurors Thursday that most of these women found him 
attractive and that he could not resist their interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Panichas, who faces 19 sexual assault counts, denied raping or 
assaulting any of the women, but admitted having sexual contact with most of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"We had sex; that's normal," Panichas testified. 
</P>
<P>
Panichas was arrested a year ago after a Las Vegas woman alleged that he had 
lured her to Orange County on the pretense of a job interview with his cellular 
telephone company, and then raped her at her hotel room in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
She testified that when she tried to close her eyes during the assault, 
Panichas forced her eyelids open. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Claims She Made Overtures 
</P>
<P>
Panichas told a different story on the witness stand Thursday in Santa Ana 
Superior Court. He said the woman, whom he had met only once before, made 
overtures to him in the car even before they reached her hotel room. After 
mutual-consent sex in the room, Panichas said, "she laid back on the pillows 
exhausted, but with a happy look on her face." 
</P>
<P>
Panichas also said that several of the women told him their personal problems 
and that he became more friendly with them because he felt sorry for them. 
</P>
<P>
But Deputy Dist. Atty. Marv Stern pointed out to Panichas that all five women 
who testified against him had known him for only a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
"What is there about you, Mr. Panichas, that makes these women want to pour out 
their troubles to you?" Stern asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just a nice guy," Panichas answered. 
</P>
<P>
Panichas, 32, who lives in Costa Mesa, said that in one case he did feel guilty 
about having sex with one of the alleged victims, because he had been married 
only about 4 months and was trying to make his marriage work. 
</P>
<P>
But Stern pointed out that Panichas had sex with another one of the alleged 
victims at a time when he was engaged. Panichas explained that when he walked 
into his office, the woman -- whom he was interviewing for a job with his 
company -- stood at a desk with her blouse off. 
</P>
<P>
Didn't his engagement give him second thoughts about having sex with this 
woman, the skeptical prosecutor asked? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No 'Second Thoughts' 
</P>
<P>
"With what I saw in front of me -- her figure -- I didn't have second thoughts 
at all," Panichas answered. 
</P>
<P>
Four other women had reported attacks by Panichas, but he was never arrested. 
Law enforcement officials say that in each case, there was a problem obtaining 
necessary information, or cooperation, to bring Panichas to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged victims were all blonde and all in their early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Stern pointed out Thursday that Panichas had told several of these women that 
he was a highly successful businessman. He showed two of them a portfolio that 
had a 1988 projected gross income for his cellular telephone company of 
$190,000. Yet law enforcement officials say Panichas' records showed that he 
had sold only a handful of cellular telephones, and had written more than 
$40,000 in bad checks to creditors. 
</P>
<P>
Panichas explained Thursday that the bad checks were written only because of a 
temporary cash-flow problem, and that a loan he expected from a benefactor 
which would get his business back on track had been thwarted by his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Panichas, a tall man with wavy gray-black hair and wearing a wide-lapel suit, 
purple tie and maroon handkerchief in his breast pocket, could face more than 
40 years in prison if convicted on all counts. He remains in custody at the 
Orange County Jail in lieu of $200,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complained to Judge 
</P>
<P>
At one point during cross-examination Thursday, Panichas complained to Judge 
David H. Brickner that Stern was not letting him tell his story and kept 
cutting off his answers. Stern pressed him why someone heading a corporation 
potentially worth $190,000 would sit for 4 hours at a gas station waiting for 
the cashier to get off work just to interview her for a receptionist job. The 
cashier is one of two women who claim Panichas sexually assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
One of the women who claims Panichas raped her was a friend of a woman whom 
Panichas had just fired as a receptionist. Panichas admitted that he drove the 
woman home after firing her. When Stern asked whether Panichas had done that 
just to get a chance to see the friend, Panichas retorted: "That's the craziest 
statement I have ever heard."

QUICKIE RAINS TO FALL UNTIL SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California will probably have a few more showers today and Saturday, 
the forecasters say, but things should be looking brighter by Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
As a damp cold front skipped through Thursday on its way to Arizona and New 
Mexico, meteorologist Dave Beusterien of WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times, said none of the current quickie storms are very wet. 
</P>
<P>
There is a good chance of some significant rain Saturday night, Beusterien 
said, when some moisture from the North Pacific is expected to slide down the 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
"That should break up by Sunday morning," he said. "Then I think we'll be 
through with this system for a while." 
</P>
<P>
The latest rain, which pattered into the area Thursday morning, was the result 
of a cold front moving through northern sections of the Southland and an 
upper-level storm system just off the coast of Northern California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, Santa Ana had 0.03 of an inch of rain Thursday, while San 
Juan Capistrano recorded 0.04 of an inch and Newport Beach registered only a 
trace, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury dipped to 39 degrees in San Juan Capistrano, 45 in Santa Ana and 50 
in Newport Beach. Daytime highs ranged from the upper 50s to the low 60s. 
</P>
<P>
There was wind and snow in Southland mountains and the snow level was expected 
to move down to 2,500 feet by this morning. Snow accumulations of 8 to 12 
inches were expected above the 7,000-foot level in the northern ranges and up 
to 8 inches in the southern ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists were being warned to carry chains in the mountains. Windblown snow, 
the forecasters said, could make the roads hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday, the Southland should be fair and slightly warmer, according to the 
National Weather Service, which said coastal high temperatures will be 64 to 68 
with local gusty north-to-northwest winds decreasing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Highs at Southern California mountain resorts are expected to be 38 to 45 over 
the weekend. They should be from 52 to 60 degrees in the high deserts and 64 to 
70 in the low deserts.

$8.5 MILLION IN COCAINE, $40,000 IN CASH SEIZED; 4 MEN HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
County drug investigators, assisted by units from Los Angeles and two other 
police jurisdictions, seized more than $8.5 million in cocaine and $40,000 in 
cash and arrested four men after a daylong surveillance, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were arrested in Los Angeles late Wednesday afternoon by Los 
Angeles police on suspicion of possession of 384 pounds of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects were identified as Jesus Bernal, 31, and Eduardo M. Hernandez, 26, 
both of Colombia, Eduin R. Barney, 28, of Miami, and Gustavo Garcia, 31, of 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Tim Simon, head of the Orange County Regional Narcotics Suppression 
Program, said information that led to the arrests was obtained when agents from 
his office went to Santa Monica to arrest Richard S. Carrera, 26, on a federal 
warrant issued in New York charging him with conspiring to sell cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Agents from the Orange County drug force -- which includes officers from the 
county, 16 cities and four federal agencies -- went to Los Angeles to pick up 
Carrera at the request of the New York office of the Drug Enforcement Agency, 
according to Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"We found information on him pertaining to possible associates and clients, 
relating to a narcotics deal that was pending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Assisted by Santa Monica police drug investigators, Simon said a surveillance 
was set up in Santa Monica near a florist shop on Pico Boulevard. While there, 
he said, the undercover officers saw an unidentified man give a package to an 
unidentified woman. The woman was followed to an area of Sepulveda Boulevard, 
where she handed the package to another man, who was later identified as 
Bernal. 
</P>
<P>
Then officers found out that Bernal was under surveillance by a team of 
officers from the Los Angeles and Simi Valley police departments, Simon said. 
The police agencies then coordinatored their surveillance and followed Bernal 
to La Frite Restaurant on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
There, in the parking lot in the late afternoon, police said, Bernal exchanged 
vehicles with two other men men later identified as Barney and Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
The two vehicles were then driven to Pasadena via the San Diego Freeway. They 
stopped in a shopping center on Colorado Boulevard. Barney and Hernandez then 
drove to a house on South Oakland Street in Pasadena, parked the vehicle in the 
garage and stayed inside the house for 15 minutes, police said. They then drove 
back to Colorado and met again with Bernal. 
</P>
<P>
That is when investigators approached the men, got permission to search the 
white Toyota and found a box containing 44 pounds of cocaine, according to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested, then agents returned to Oakland Street, where Garcia 
was arrested at the house after officers found three large duffel bags 
containing 340 pounds of cocaine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Carrera was booked into Orange County Jail and has been arraigned on the 
federal warrant. The package that was delivered to Bernal was also recovered 
and found to contain $40,000 in cash, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said the 384 pounds of cocaine seized had a street value of more than 
$8.5 million.

HOWELL RESIGNS AFTER 2 SEASONS AS FOOTHILL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Howell has resigned as Foothill High School's football coach after 2 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Howell compiled a 9-12 record at Foothill, but led the Knights to the Division 
III playoffs in 1988 with a third-place finish in the Century League. Foothill 
lost in the first round, ending a 5-6 season. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, 43, was hired in June of 1987 from Eastern Oregon State, where he had 
failed to win a football game on the field in 3 years. Eastern Oregon State was 
1-25-3 under Howell, the only victory a 2-0 forfeit by Southern Oregon in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Howell, who replaced highly successful Ted Mullen at Foothill, was 4-6 in his 
first season, the Knights' first losing season since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"Jerry came from out of the area and arrived late, so from the start, hiring a 
good staff was a problem," said Jim Ryan, Foothill principal. "He was under 
some pressure, but any coach in Orange County is under pressure when his 
program isn't successful." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan said Howell also resigned his teaching position and the school will begin 
taking applications for coaches with a teaching position available. Howell 
could not be reached for comment. TOM HAMILTON

The Ocean View High School girls' basketball team erased any doubts Thursday 
night about it being a contender for the Sunset league basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
Senior guard Cossette Smith's free throw with 33 seconds left helped Ocean View 
hold off Fountain Valley, 26-25, in a league game at Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the second in 6 days for Ocean View over Fountain Valley. Last 
Friday, Ocean View squeezed by the Barons, 47-46, in the championship game of 
the Edison-Marina girls' tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew coming into the game that Fountain Valley would be fired up," Ocean 
View Coach Ollie Martin said. "Everything was against us from the start, but we 
stayed together and battled the entire game." 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View improves its record to 15-2 overall, 2-0 in league. Fountain Valley, 
last year's league champions and favored to repeat, is 9-7, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks built a 15-8 halftime lead in a game where both teams struggled 
offensively. The Barons came out more aggressive in the third quarter and tied 
the score, 17-17, on lay-in by senior center Danielle Barlow. 
</P>
<P>
Barlow and teammate Renae Lambrigger led the comeback. The Barons led, 22-21, 
with less than 6 minutes to play on a 3-point play by Barlow, a layup and a 
free throw. Lambrigger added 6 of her game-high 10 points and 5 of her 8 
rebounds in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
With just 3:10 to play, Ocean View's Fabiola Nunez scored on a layup to give 
the Seahawks a 25-22 advantage. Lambrigger then cut the lead to 25-24 with a 
pull-up jumper, but the Barons could not convert in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan's free throw gave Ocean View a 2-point lead. Lambrigger made a free 
throw with 11 seconds left to make the score 26-25, but her last-second shot 
was rejected by Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
Nunez led Ocean View with 8 points. Barlow had 9 points and a game-high 11 
rebounds for Fountain Valley.

U.S. oil companies plan to increase exploration spending in 1989 and many are 
particularly focusing on more investment in natural gas drilling, according to 
an industry survey by Salomon Bros. The survey also found that although major 
U.S. oil companies are planning a general increase in exploration and 
production spending, less money will go toward drilling in the United States.

PRICE CUTTING, COST CONTROL MEASURES BLAMED; 
</P>
<P>
AST FORECASTS LOSS OF $7 MILLION TO $9 MILLION FOR SECOND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AST Research Inc., an Irvine technology firm that has expanded rapidly in the 
personal computer market, said Thursday that it expects to report a loss of $7 
million to $9 million for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the anticipated red ink to aggressive price cutting by 
AST's competitors as well as internal cost-cutting measures and an accounting 
charge related to the anticipated sale of one of its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
AST also said it expects to report sales of $110 million for the quarter. The 
quarterly results will be released in about 3 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
For the year-earlier quarter, AST reported earnings of $2 million on sales of 
$92.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The expected loss reflects heated competition within the personal computer 
market. AST entered that market in 1987 with the introduction of a line of 
IBM-compatible machines, and its rapid sales gains surprised many industry 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had been forecasting a weak second quarter for the firm, but the 
magnitude of AST's expected losses caught some by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Harris, a securities analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in 
Los Angeles, said he had been projecting a loss of about $1 million for the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said that AST has been under pressure to cut prices on its Premium/286 
line of personal computers in the wake of earlier price cuts by competitors 
such as Wyse Technology. In December, the San Jose company slashed prices by 
10% to 15% on many competing products, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, sales of AST's Premium/286 computers have been hurt by the 
introduction in September of a competing IBM product. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of the losses would come from the accounting charge that AST would 
incur if it decides to sell off its Camintonn division, which makes products 
for systems compatible with Digital Equipment Corp. computers. 
</P>
<P>
AST said the sale of Camintonn and other cost-cutting steps would probably 
result in a charge to earnings of as much as $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Revenue generated by the Camintonn unit accounted for about 2.5% of AST's $413 
million in sales last year, said Bruce Edwards, AST chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards said AST is considering selling the unit because "it no longer fits 
with our core business of IBM compatible systems." 
</P>
<P>
AST's earnings projection was made after the close of stock market trading 
Thursday. The company's stock closed at $8.50 per share, down 37.5 cents.

LAURA SCUDDER'S SITE TO BECOME A BUSINESS PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a deal estimated to be worth about $8 million, a Los Angeles development 
firm has acquired the site of the former Laura Scudder's snack foods plant in 
Anaheim to build a mixed-use industrial-commercial-retail park. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers Perez Associates, which has an Irvine office and has been active in the 
county for more than a decade, said it plans to tear down the 
218,000-square-foot Laura Scudder's facility and develop the 18.7-acre site as 
a business park with 300,000 square feet of single-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers Perez said it will spend $25 million to buy and develop the property at 
1525 N. Raymond Ave. The company would not disclose the price it paid for the 
parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate industry sources familiar with the area said, however, that the 
site probably sold for $7.5 million to $8 million, or $9 to $10 a square foot. 
The costs of demolishing the existing food processing facility and cleaning up 
the site would have kept the selling price below the $12-per-square-foot norm 
for vacant industrial land in the area, said the sources, who asked to remain 
unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers Perez said it intends to build 140,000 square feet of buildings that 
will be sold outright and 160,000 square feet that will be leased to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Scudder's, which opened the plant in 1960, was acquired by Borden Inc. in 
September, 1987. A month later, Borden announced that it was closing the aging 
Anaheim headquarters and processing plant and consolidating the Laura Scudder's 
operations at a newer facility in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 workers were laid off when the plant was closed in May and the 
facility was offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers Perez, which plans to call the redeveloped parcel the Raymond Commerce 
Center, has been developing the 46-acre Von Karman Corporate Center in Irvine 
in the past 6 years and recently developed the Hughes Microelectronics facility 
in the industrial park at Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
David Kray, acquisitions director for Bowers Perez, said the developer's 
financial backer for the Anaheim project is a private investor who has asked to 
remain unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
Kray said because of its size and location next to the Riverside Freeway, 
competition for the Anaheim parcel was heated, with at least six firms 
submitting bids. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Bowers Perez said construction will begin in the 
second quarter, with the first phase ready for occupancy by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
There will be some commercial and retail space in the new center, but the 
development will have a strong industrial orientation aimed at smaller 
companies, Kray said. 
</P>
<P>
His firm's studies show that there is a pent-up demand for industrial 
facilities as small as 1,200 square feet in the Anaheim area and that 
manufacturers with the need for large facilities are looking toward Riverside 
and San Bernardino counties, where land and construction costs are lower, Kray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A major appeal of the Laura Scudder's site, he said, is its central location, 
with access on the Riverside Freeway to Los Angeles and the Inland Empire.

A group of investors including conservative economist Arthur B. Laffer has come 
up with $2.7 million in a private stock offering to fund American Patriots 
Inc., a Corona del Mar insurance holding company. 
</P>
<P>
The firm was formed early last year and is negotiating to purchase a company 
that underwrites workers compensation insurance and excess and surplus 
insurance, said Joseph V. Delaney, chairman and chief executive of American 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Excess and surplus insurance covers policy holders with coverage not only for 
extra insurance but also for new or unusual risks. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney said American Patriots will turn any company it acquires into its 
subsidiary. He said the acquisition is expected to be announced soon. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 40 institutional investors already have been lined up to provide more 
than $200 million in senior debt to help finance the purchase of a company, he 
said.

Terry Black joked that his ideal mate would be "a woman who travels a lot." 
</P>
<P>
"We could have a deliriously happy relationship 2 days a week, and then she 
would be out of town on business trips the other 5," the Costa Mesa 
screenwriter said, tongue somewhat in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
He is not alone in his need to be alone. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach author Doug Muir can become so enmeshed in his fiction that he 
neglects friendships. Laguna Nigel poet Susan Hecht enjoys spending secluded 
weekends hiking in the mountains. Laguna Beach musician Ronald Ravenscroft 
cited "the inclination to remove one's self from society" when he is composing. 
</P>
<P>
Whether painting with watercolors or words, creative people share a need for 
what cannot be shared: solitude. Without it, no great book would have ever been 
written or sculpture ever sculpted. 
</P>
<P>
Yet pop psychology reveres social interaction almost to the exclusion of 
equally vital roads to self-fulfillment, Oxford University psychiatrist Anthony 
Storr complained in his recently released book, "Solitude." 
</P>
<P>
"Current wisdom assumes that man is a social being who needs the companionship 
and affection of other human beings from cradle to grave," the book begins. "It 
is widely believed that interpersonal relationships of an intimate kind are the 
chief source of happiness." 
</P>
<P>
However, Storr noted, many creative geniuses throughout history have led 
rewarding lives absent of marriage: composer Ludwig van Beethoven, artist 
Francisco Goya y Lucientes, writer Franz Kafka, physicist Sir Isaac Newton and 
philosopher Rene Descartes. 
</P>
<P>
"One might argue that people who have no abiding interests other than their 
spouses and families are as limited intellectually as those who have neither 
spouse nor children may be emotionally," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The retired professor said in an interview that "our culture has made us feel 
guilty if we like to be alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We do need interaction with others, but many aspects of one's self are only 
discovered in solitude. When we're with other people, we tend to lose 
ourselves, to overadjust." 
</P>
<P>
"Creative people draw inward," said Black, 34, who wrote the 1988 movie "Dead 
Heat," starring Treat Williams. "As a result, you look to your own ideas and 
examine them more closely than an extroverted person might; any little spark 
gets attention and has opportunity to flourish. If you are too extroverted, 
your attention is diffused by all your contacts, and you don't have that 
pinpointed focus a creative person has." 
</P>
<P>
Although a bachelor whose "creativity springs from solitude," Black said, "I 
don't eliminate the possibility of marriage, if the right girl comes along. She 
would have to be someone who could sympathize with a writer's odd personal 
habits. If you know anybody who qualifies, send her my way." 
</P>
<P>
Married and the father of three, Storr did not hail single life as an 
intellectual virtue. But he repeatedly stressed in his book his belief that the 
modern mind-set places far too much importance on matrimony as the ultimate 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with the divorce rate as high as it is, we still have this romantic 
notion that marriage is the happy ending -- but it's really not all that big of 
a deal," Storr laughed in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
He attributed this 20th-Century obsession with wedlock to psychoanalyst Sigmund 
Freud's "emphasis on sex as the source of fulfillment." 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually all the great philosophers in the Western world since the Greeks 
have been unmarried," he said. "And the Victorians thought it was rather 
admirable if you were strong enough and courageous enough to live on your own. 
</P>
<P>
"But today we glorify marriage, as if there were something wrong with not being 
married. I think that's very hard on people because not everybody's suited to 
marriage. Not everybody needs it or wants it." 
</P>
<P>
Artist Nixson Borah discovered "a new-found freedom" in the dissolution of his 
long marriage. Bachelorhood, he said, has allowed him to pursue creative 
outlets formerly unfeasible -- including a move to his downtown Los Angeles 
loft after living for 25 years in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have raised my family in this loft," said the 50-year-old father of 
two adult children. "We needed a house with doors to shut so that all of us 
could have our separate spaces." 
</P>
<P>
"I love the jingle of city life -- the pace, the energy, the art openings and 
concerts to go to. I see the contrasts of our society -- Skid Row and 
skyscrapers -- much more vividly than I was conscious of when living in 
suburbia," said Borah, who commutes four times a week to teach at Fullerton 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Muir, 56, a film editor until he began writing suspense novels in 1985, said he 
could not have afforded his midlife career change were he responsible for a 
wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell my students, while you're still single, get out there and take a 
gamble," said Muir, who teaches at Irvine Valley College. "Write that book 
while you have the freedom to take financial risks; you might not ever get the 
chance to do it again." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than viewing her single status as facilitating her writing, Hecht has 
found that she consumes more time socializing than she did when married. 
</P>
<P>
"People who are married will stay home at night, but when you live alone you're 
more apt to want to go out," the 40-year-old poet said. "So I'm not sure that 
being married impinged upon my writing; I think it's always been me." 
</P>
<P>
Even when married, Hecht sought out large doses of solitude: "I'm probably 
alone more than a lot of people are and like it more. During my 30s, I devoted 
some time to validating my need for solitude -- I let myself feel OK about it. 
I was brought up with the attitude that just sitting around and thinking was 
lazy and unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
"But I've come to realize that creative people have to spend a lot of time 
daydreaming and looking like they're doing nothing -- that is indeed part of 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
Like Hecht, creative people in general take deep pleasure in their own company 
and thoughts, Storr said. Often they develop their streak of emotional 
independence while children. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite a number of famous writers were for some reason isolated in childhood, 
which set them off on the path of using their imagination more than the 
average," Storr said. He named Beatrix Potter, Edward Lear and Rudyard Kipling 
as examples of writers who passed much of their young lives in a world apart 
from their peers. 
</P>
<P>
"I began painting at age 3 because I had severe asthma that made recreational 
activities difficult," Borah said. "I wouldn't wish asthma on any child, but at 
least it led me to be creative." 
</P>
<P>
Singer/songwriter Jennifer Warnes, who was raised in Anaheim and is acclaimed 
for her unusual and delicate voice, recalled that she "was not very present in 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
"They were pleasant years, but something much more important was occupying my 
inner life," she said. "I was planning my breakaway and just watching the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a memory of walking to the bus stop every morning at 6, to get to 
Montessori in Santa Ana by 6:45, and thinking, 'If I were to meet these people 
sometime again in my life, they would never know me. If I left right now, they 
would never even notice.' " 
</P>
<P>
Now a Los Angeles resident, the Grammy-winning musician said she has recognized 
a common thread running through performing artists from the county: "I've 
talked to a lot of people who grew up in Orange County: (musicians) Jackson 
Browne, the Dirt Band, the Righteous Brothers, (comedians) Steve Martin, Pat 
Paulsen, (actress) Diane Keaton. They all say that their vision of the world 
and of their work developed in the privacy of their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, there were no art museums of any note in Orange County, no 
predominate ghettos, no real cultural celebration. Those of us who wanted to 
see a Van Gogh or experience a ballet had to go to the libraries. If you could 
read about it in a book, you could imagine it to be true. But you couldn't see 
it first hand, like a person raised in Greenwich Village could. 
</P>
<P>
"So our work was influenced by nobody or nothing, except our imaginations. We 
had no grand masters. The people who came out of that era are highly 
individualistic." 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "basic high school nerd," Black today has no regrets about his 
gawky adolescence. "I turned to writing as an escape," the Pittsburgh native 
said. "Now that I am grown up, sort of, I find that I have become more adept at 
making friends -- yet the writing skills I developed as a lonely teen-ager 
don't go away. So I can have my cake and eat it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Like Black, most creative people appreciate the social and private side to 
their personalities. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because an artist shuts the studio door when he's painting, it doesn't 
mean that he's unconnected to the world," Borah said. "The artists I know are 
very socially active." 
</P>
<P>
"A writer has to experience life -- to travel, to interact, to get out and 
scrape the underbelly of society," said Muir, author of "Tides of War," 
"American Reich" and "Red Star Run." 
</P>
<P>
But when the time comes to sit down and write about those experiences, Muir 
added, "it's just me and my computer." 
</P>
<P>
"For most people, interacting with colleagues at the office is a necessary part 
of their work," said composer Ravenscroft, 34, whose violin concerto was 
performed last year by the Pacific Symphony. "Composing, however, is done in 
complete quiet. During creative times, I'm sensitive to the slightest sound; 
the buzzing of the refrigerator can drive me insane." 
</P>
<P>
Creativity at its best occurs only in total solitude, Borah agreed. "Other 
people's judgments come later, when the work is finished. But if outside voices 
are telling you what to do while you are creating, you cannot hear your own 
inner voice." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the reason there are so many bad movies and bad television shows is 
that film and TV are very much collaborative mediums," said Black, who is 
writing a science-fiction movie for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"When a movie is based on a book, you always hear the complaint that the book 
was better," he said. "That's because a book comes from one person, whereas a 
movie comes from the consensus of a committee." 
</P>
<P>
Benefits of solitude apply not only to those who possess artistic talent, Storr 
said, but to all people -- married or single. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody needs a hobby or a passionate interest to call their own," he said. 
"Everybody needs something to which they can turn, no matter what happens -- 
for there is always an element of uncertainty in interpersonal relationships."

A FRESH-AIR APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

"Shooting stars!" 
</P>
<P>
The excited cries that went up from the group of sixth-grade girls on an 
astronomy walk soon gave way to embarrassed giggles as they realized that the 
supposed meteorites were really just the beams of their own flashlights, 
playing across the power lines overhead. 
</P>
<P>
If the girls, from Swain and King elementary schools in Cypress, didn't seem 
quite at home in the great outdoors, they could easily be forgiven. For many of 
the sixth-graders who each week make the trek to Orange County's Outdoor 
Science School, this is a first experience in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
This school year, more than 15,000 students -- more than half the sixth-graders 
in Orange County, plus many from outside the county -- will travel to five 
sites in the San Bernardino Mountains to attend the weeklong school. 
</P>
<P>
There, they learn about geology, wildlife, ecology and astronomy in a series of 
hikes and other activities that take a hands-on approach to environmental 
education. The Cypress students, who recently spent a week at a site near the 
tiny village of Forest Falls, panned for gold in the canyon stream, took night 
hikes in search of nocturnal animals, looked for birds with binoculars and saw 
Jupiter and four of its moons through a telescope. 
</P>
<P>
While the students also learn camp songs and put together their own skits -- 
with a nature theme -- the Outdoor Science School is not a summer camp, 
insisted Lauren Pollock, acting principal of the Forest Home site. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids get that confused sometimes," Pollock said. "We run a very strict 
program." 
</P>
<P>
The school started in 1974 with one site and 1,400 children. The Cypress School 
District had started its own outdoor school in 1967, and eventually the two 
programs merged. As the school has grown, it has gradually changed focus, 
evolving from an experience-based program that taught outdoor skills to one 
that emphasizes the natural sciences. 
</P>
<P>
"The curriculum has really tightened up a lot," Pollock said. "I think our 
science has gotten better." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Baker, who oversees all five Outdoor Science School sites as principal, 
said the program is based on the premise that students can learn science better 
in a hands-on situation than in the classroom. "What's best taught in the 
outdoors, teach in the outdoors," Baker said. "If you teach about astronomy, 
take them outside." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Baker said, the science curriculum at many elementary schools is lacking. 
"Some districts don't touch science," he said. "For some kids, this is the 
highlight of their science learning." 
</P>
<P>
The buildup to the weeklong mountain trip begins early. In first through third 
grades, a traveling naturalist from the county makes a visit to each classroom 
with live animals and related exhibits. In the fourth and fifth grades, 
students make two full-day field trips to county sites such as Upper Newport 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Once in the mountains, the students are split into cabin groups of 10 for the 
5-day program. One adult cabin leader, also trained as an activity leader, is 
responsible for each group. Every week during the school year, each Outdoor 
Science School site handles about 100 children, with a staff that includes one 
acting principal, one naturalist, one environmental program leader, one nurse, 
four unit leaders and 10 cabin leaders. Also, the students' classroom leaders 
come along. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real people-oriented," Baker said. "There's a lot of individual 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to participate in the Outdoor Science School is made by the 
individual districts. The county pays 10% of the program's cost, while the rest 
($134 to $146 per student, depending on the time of year) is the responsibility 
of the districts. 
</P>
<P>
In some districts, the amount is paid entirely by the students' families, while 
other districts put up all or part of the fee, sometimes with the help of 
fund-raisers or state lottery money. In some districts, students even start a 
class bank account as early as first grade that they contribute to with class 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the big deal of elementary school," Bill Kuehl said. "It's the main 
event." Kuehl is a teacher at Swain who has been going to the mountains with 
his class for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Konowal of Swain was one of the teachers who started the program for the 
Cypress district, and he has been coming up every year since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
One of the things he finds valuable about the program is the opportunity to 
spend time with his students outside the school environment. 
</P>
<P>
It is often a shock, he said, for students to eat with the teachers or see them 
wearing blue jeans. "We find the kids really look at you more as human beings," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps with building the bond between teacher and student," Kuehl said. "You 
learn about them as people. They learn more about us also." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the students, it is not only a first real outdoor experience, but 
it is also the first time away from home. Along with the lessons in science 
come a few life lessons, such as social and cooperative living skills -- "How 
to get along in a group," as Pollock explained. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of familiar classmates and classroom teachers helps ease what 
could otherwise be a traumatic experience. "It's more of a secure environment 
for that first time," Pollock said. 
</P>
<P>
As a teacher, Konowal has seen some students branded as rough or "problem" 
children suddenly come out of their shells in the mountains, inspired by the 
surroundings or, often, by the role models offered by cabin leaders, who are 
usually college-age. 
</P>
<P>
"You feel this is a little flicker of light in that kid's life," Konowal said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress district pays half of each student's fee for the Outdoor Science 
School, and sometimes more if the student's family can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"For a small district like Cypress, that's a major expense," Konowal said, "but 
it's worth it."

Since 1987, California licensed drivers 55 and older have been entitled to auto 
insurance premium discounts on liability, medical and collision coverage if 
every three years they take a state-approved course designed to improve driving 
skills and promote road safety. Although discounts depend on a person's driving 
record and insurance carrier, the law applies to all California automobile 
insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
The improvement course is available at private driving schools, public and 
private colleges and offered by nonprofit organizations at community-based 
locations. The cost is usually $8. The Department of Motor Vehicles will issue 
certificates to those who complete the course. The certificate must be 
submitted to an insurance carrier for discount benefit.

A state commission narrowly decided today to allow Peggy Ann Buckey, a former 
defendant in the McMartin Pre-School molestation case, to teach deaf and 
learning-disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Teacher Credentialing voted 7 to 6, with one abstention, to 
restore Buckey's teaching credential, following the opinion of an 
administrative law judge. There was no comment or debate. 
</P>
<P>
Buckey, 32, had held a permanent teacher's position in Anaheim in 1984, when 
she was one of seven defendants charged with allegedly molesting students at 
the defunct Manhattan Beach school. All charges against her and four other 
defendants were dropped in January, 1986, for lack of evidence. Only Buckey's 
brother, Ray, and mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, remain on trial.

A federal grand jury indicted Yolo County Sheriff Rod Graham today for 
conspiracy, extortion and bribery stemming from a three-year FBI investigation 
into corruption in the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second indictment involving the sheriff's office. Last month, 
Graham's former assistant, Wendell Luttrull, also was charged with extorting 
money in exchange for official services. Luttrull pleaded guilty Dec. 1 to a 
single count of violating the federal Hobbs Act. At the time, Luttrull made a 
court statement implicating his former boss. If he is convicted, the charges 
against Graham could bring a maximum sentence of 75 years in prison. He will 
not be arrested, but ordered to appear in court later.

"This is unacceptable. This incident poisons the atmosphere on the eve of the 
Paris conference," said Shevardnadze, who is scheduled to meet Secretary of 
State George P. Shultz on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be no more negative complications in the Mediterranean," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about U.S. claims that Libya is building a chemical weapons plant, the 
Soviet minister said, "I think that without proof, no government has the right 
to make such an accusation." 
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Shultz spent the day seeking support from his foreign 
counterparts in the U.S. effort to pressure Libya into halting operations at 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz, who arrived a day earlier, met today with French President Francois 
Mitterrand, French Prime Minister Michel Rocard and the foreign ministers of 
France, Canada, Egypt and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, France, Canada and Egypt joined in supporting the U.S. contentions 
that Libya is manufacturing poison gas in a factory southwest of Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moammar Kadafi has insisted only pharmaceuticals were being 
manufactured at the Rabta complex 60 miles southwest of the Libyan capital. But 
Shultz contends he has adequate evidence to support the U.S. allegation. 
</P>
<P>
A top U.S. official said Shultz plans to brief Shevardnadze on evidence that 
the Libyans plan to make chemical weapons at the Rabta plant. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Shultz) will tell them (the Soviets) more than they know now, but less 
than what our allies know," the official said.

Sixteen more Polish fishermen jumped ship and requested political asylum in the 
United States as their vessel refueled outside Boston Harbor, officials said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second defection of Polish fishermen in the city's harbor in a week 
and the third in a year. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has granted 
visitors' permits to the previous sailors. 
</P>
<P>
The fishermen, all members of the Solidarity union, left their ship, Kantar, in 
two shifts Thursday afternoon. They boarded a fuel barge and were transported 
to a Coast Guard station. Arrangements are being made with local families for 
housing.

PHILIPPINE TROOPS STORM GARRISON;

DISSIDENT MUSLIMS KILL GENERAL WHO WAS HELD HOSTAGE

Troops backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers today stormed a military 
garrison after Muslim dissidents killed a general they were holding hostage, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital near the garrison said at least five people were wounded. A wounded 
soldier reported numerous dead, and city Police Chief Lt. Col. Jovencio Gongora 
said several bodies were still inside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
Gongora said he suspended the assault at dark. Bodies could not be recovered 
because some dissident Muslims were believed still on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told reporters in Manila the attack began after 
the military learned that the regional constabulary commander, Brig. Gen. 
Eduardo Batalla, had been shot and killed by a renegade Muslim policeman. 
</P>
<P>
One of the wounded, Staff Sgt. Rosendo Novelenio, told reporters that there 
were "many dead" on the second floor of the headquarters building where Batalla 
and his chief of staff, Col. Romeo Abendan, had been held. There was no word on 
Abendan's fate. 
</P>
<P>
The two were taken hostage Thursday after Batalla ordered Muslim policemen to 
surrender their weapons and face murder charges in a 1984 incident. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Ramon Mitra said the military decided to storm the garrison after 
the policemen's leader, Rizal Alih, rejected Mitra's last offer. Mitra had 
asked to see Batalla and verify he was alive. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said 30 to 40 armed men, some of whom may have been Muslim soldiers, 
apparently slipped into the headquarters building overnight to join Alih and an 
estimated 15 followers. The captors demanded to be flown to Siasi Island, 120 
miles to the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Mitra said Alih reneged on an overnight deal to end the dispute in exchange for 
a safe passage to Palawan Island, where he would surrender to military police.

British investigators now believe the bomb that tore apart a Pan Am airliner 
over Scotland last month, killing 270 people, was probably smuggled aboard by a 
worker at London's Heathrow Airport, West German intelligence sources said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said British investigators were working from the theory that the 
explosive was placed in a passage directly under the cockpit, connecting it 
with the baggage hold. The sources said British media speculation that the bomb 
might have been planted in a passenger's luggage in a connecting flight from 
Frankfurt and then transferred to the jumbo jet at Heathrow is being 
increasingly discounted by British investigators.

Arab radicals today announced the formation of a new alliance in the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip that includes Muslim fundamentalists and pro-Syrian 
extremists opposed to the Palestine Liberation Organization and Yasser Arafat's 
recent peace overtures. 
</P>
<P>
In a leaflet issued today, the Palestinian radicals accused Arafat of "selling 
out Palestine to imperialism and Zionism" in his announcement at a news 
conference in Geneva last month that he recognizes Israel and renounces 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
"We demand the establishment of a militant leadership to replace the 
diminishing leadership of Yasser Arafat," said the leaflet, which was signed by 
the United National Front in Occupied Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
The group is an alliance of Islamic extremists and pro-Syrian radicals, 
including members of Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command and Abu Moussa's breakaway faction of Arafat's 
mainstream Fatah. 
</P>
<P>
The leaflet said the group "rejected all surrenderist solutions" and advocated 
"liberating the whole of Palestine through armed struggle." 
</P>
<P>
The leaflet also called for the formation of a new Palestine National Council. 
</P>
<P>
Also today, police said they suspected Palestinian nationalists were 
responsible for the killing of an Israeli shot to death in the occupied West 
Bank Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli hikers clashed with Arabs as they made their way past the West Bank 
village of Beit Inan today, Israel Radio said. The hikers opened fire at 
youths, who hurled large rocks at them, but there were no reports of injuries, 
Israel Radio said.

JOBLESS RATE DROPS TO 5.3%, A 14-YEAR LOW;

3.8 MILLION JOBS CREATED IN '88; FIGURES SIGNAL MORE ECONOMIC GROWTH

Unemployment dipped to 5.3% in December, matching a 14-year low, the government 
said today in a year-end report that assured President Reagan of leaving office 
with joblessness at the lowest point of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3.8 million jobs were created last year, the most since 1984, and 3 
million of them were in service industries. 
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate averaged 5.5% for all of last year, down from 6.2% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department said December's unemployment rate was down 0.1 percentage 
point from November, hitting 5.3% for the third time in 1988, the lowest level 
since the 5.1% recorded in May of 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Service-producing industries led in the creation of 279,000 new jobs last 
month. The 3.8 million jobs created during the year were the most since 1984's 
total of 3.95 million, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers reflected continued economic growth and brought renewed talk of 
higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows that the economy has not shifted to a lower gear," said economist 
Roger Brimmer of Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass., forecasting service. 
"With the economy continuing to operate at these levels and continuing to grow 
as rapidly as it is, inflation is going to keep creeping up." 
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings, however, remained unchanged for the third consecutive 
month at $9.45. This statistic is closely watched for indications of inflation, 
but the growth of wages from December, 1987, to December, 1988, was just 3.4%, 
behind the inflation rate of 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rose to 10.8% in '82 
</P>
<P>
When Reagan took office in January, 1981, unemployment was 7.5%. It rose to 
10.8% late in the 1981-82 recession, the highest level in four decades, before 
beginning to decline. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Norwood, commissioner of labor statistics, reported that 3 million of the 
new jobs last year were on the service side of the economy, including 700,000 
in retail trade, more than 400,000 in manufacturing and 300,000 in 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Rebounding exports helped in manufacturing, particularly the machinery 
industry. Factory workers continued to average four hours of overtime a week in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 279,000 new jobs in December, 107,000 were in the business and health 
services industries. Retail trade added 52,000 new jobs for the month, most of 
them in department stores during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
The department said the number of jobless people fell by 9,000 to 6,554,000 
last month. It reported that there were 950,000 "discouraged workers" -- people 
who want jobs but who are not included in the unemployment rate because they 
have given up looking for work in the belief that none is available. That 
figure has been constant since early 1987.

Armenians in Orange County held a traditional Christmas Mass today, but their

</P>
<P>
Priests of the Forty Martyrs Armenia Apolistic Church in Santa Ana canceled the 
traditional candlelight procession and afternoon party usually held on this 
day, the day Christmas is traditionally celebrated in Armenia. They instead 
added a Requiem Mass for victims of Armenia's devastating Dec. 7 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds were expected to fill the church hall by the end of the three-hour 
service, which began at 10:30 a.m. "This year we are not happy," church member 
Wartini Jakerian said. "We are praying for our people."

Inflation on the consumer level rose in the 12-nation European Economic

Eurostat said November consumer prices climbed 4.1% over a year ago and 0.4 
percentage points from October. The agency said the data indicated that 
December inflation would put the rate for the year at 4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
"It confirms the speeding up of inflation, which has been evident since the 
summer of 1988," Eurostat said. 
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said the increase in November was caused by substantial rises in

Intense negotiations between troubled Eastern Airlines and its largest union, 
in a contract dispute for more than a year, began today under the direction of 
the chairman of the National Mediation Board. 
</P>
<P>
Management negotiators headed by Tom Matthews, senior vice president for human 
resources, and Machinists negotiators led by District 100 President Charles E. 
Bryan began meeting this morning at an undisclosed location. No deadline has 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Walter Wallace of the National Mediation Board flew here Thursday from 
Washington to oversee the talks, which will continue daily late into the night, 
unless Wallace and mediator Harry Bickford decide the two sides are making no 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
A federal declaration of an impasse would trigger a 30-day cooling-off period, 
after which the 8,500-member union could strike and management would impose its 
own work conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"Mediators are always optimistic, but we have a ways to go," said Bickford, who 
has directed the mediation since Jan. 26. Mediation began then after 
negotiations stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace's presence adds to the pressure on the negotiators to settle. Entry of 
such a high-level mediator usually would not occur until the 30-day cooling-off 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said management wants a settlement, although 
Eastern executives have been lobbying for months for declaration of an impasse. 
They say a 30-day deadline will get the talks moving. 
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been $200 million apart since July. The Machinists' last 
offer called for a $50-million raise; the company asked $150 million in wage 
concessions, mainly from such non-mechanics as baggage handlers and janitors, 
who make up about half the Machinists union.

Digital Equipment Corp., the company that invented the minicomputer, is now 
trying to convince its customers that it is just as serious about desktop 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
The company hopes to make a big splash Tuesday with the announcement of a host 
of new desktop models, marking a move from expensive minicomputers to more 
down-market personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
The effort represents a major change in attitude for one of the world's three 
largest computer companies, industry analysts said. However, it may not solve 
Digital's biggest problem of the past year, a slowdown in sales of its most 
profitable product, the most advanced VAX minicomputer. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in November (chairman) Ken Olsen said the problem with sales was at the 
high end of the line," said Jay Stevens, computer analyst with Dean Witter 
Reynolds Inc. "They are adding additional machines at the low end but that 
offers no resolution to the main problem." 
</P>
<P>
With sales of the more expensive high-end machines expected to remain sluggish 
through the first half of this year, analysts expect Digital to report lower 
earnings for its fiscal year no matter how spectacular its desktop strategy. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock has been rising over the past two months in anticipation of 
the much-publicized announcement of new models, which will include a family of 
personal computers manufactured by Tandy Corp. and a high-powered workstation 
based on a computer chip from MIPS Computer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
But analysts caution that the announcement will not turn Digital's outlook 
around immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the products will be very, very aggressively priced," said Marc 
Schulman, who follows Digital for UBS Securities. A combination of slim profit 
margins on the new models and initial limited production volumes will prevent 
the products from boosting Digital's results for the next six to nine months, 
Schulman said.

The U.S. dollar rose sharply against major currencies in busy European trading 
today after the release of U.S. employment figures for December. Gold prices 
were lower.

Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar rose early in the day on firming U.S.

The stock market managed to post a modest gain today, extending the rally that 
has carried the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest levels since the 
crash of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow's average of 30 industrials rose 3.75 to 2,194.29, finishing the week 
with a net gain of 25.72 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 971 up, 509 down and 477 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 161.33 million shares, against 174.04 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained .47 to 157.96. 
</P>
<P>
Traders had spent the week in anticipation of today's Labor Department report 
on the civilian unemployment rate, which dropped to 5.3% in December from 5.4% 
the month before. Accompanying data showed a 279,000 increase in nonfarm 
payroll employment. 
</P>
<P>
The report, released before the NYSE opened, signalled persistent strength in 
the economy and did nothing to relieve expectations on Wall Street that the 
Federal Reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign to keep inflation 
from reviving. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers were pretty much in line with advance estimates on the Street, 
however, and thus were no great surprise to traders. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said portfolio managers at investing institutions were continuing to 
buy stocks to put some of their large cash reserves to work at the start of a 
new year. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were mixed at midday today after the Labor Department released its 
report showing that the civilian unemployment rate fell in December. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up 3/32 point, or nearly $1 for 
every $1,000 in face value, around midday. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction from its price, was holding at 9.08%. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said although the Labor Department figures were in line with 
expectations, bond investors were focusing on figures showing that average 
wages remained flat at an average of $9.45 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"That gives some support to the notion that we have a strong economy but it 
hasn't set off a new inflationary spiral yet," said Carol Stone, an economist 
with Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term and 
intermediate government issues were down between 1/32 and 1/16 point, and 
long-term issues were unchanged to 3/32 point higher, according to the 
financial information service Telerate Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9% at around midday, up from 8 15/16% late Thursday.

NO EARLY NCAA ACTION ON TARKANIAN

The NCAA Committee on Infractions will not consider any response to a U.S. 
Supreme Court decision involving Nevada-Las Vegas basketball coach Jerry 
Tarkanian until April at the earliest, an NCAA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the committee will be briefed on the decision at the NCAA convention 
in San Francisco next week. But the committee will not be prepared to take any 
action when it holds its next formal meeting at San Diego Feb. 3-5, NCAA 
spokesman David Berst said. 
</P>
<P>
The high court ruled Dec. 12 that the NCAA was a private agency and does not 
have to consider due process when ordering a member institution to suspend a 
coach. The high court decision presented a Catch-22 for public colleges and 
universities, saying the schools would be required to afford due process when 
carrying out NCAA-ordered suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court decision ended a legal battle that began in 1977 when 
Nevada-Las Vegas was placed on two years probation for basketball recruiting 
violations. The NCAA also ordered Tarkanian suspended for two years.

Due to an editing error in Wednesday's article on the Los Angeles International 
Folk Dance Festival, it was incorrectly stated that impresario Irwin Parnes
