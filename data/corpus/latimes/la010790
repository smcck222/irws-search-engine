LAST WILL AND MONKEYWRENCH;

<P>
HAYDUKE LIVES! BY EDWARD ABBEY (LITTLE, BROWN: $18.95; 318 PP.; 0-316-00411-1)

<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, after 15 long years, the Monkey Wrench Gang's all here. Doc Sarvis, 
he's a pediatrician up in Salt Lake City; Bonnie Abbzug, she's his wife now, a 
mother too, and pregnant with a second child; Seldom Seen Smith, he's working 
as a guide, still got three wives; George Washington Hayduke, well, some say 
he's dead, but actually he's the bag lady right over there at that table in the 
cheap cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The Lone Ranger is getting long in tooth, and he's sprawled out cold in the 
privy, his glass eye rolling loose on the floor, his pockets stuffed with 
chicken entrails. The Monkey Wrench Gang is on probation and kind of hanging 
low. And Edward Abbey, he is dead, but here he is talking again in "Hayduke 
Lives!," his final novel, and in many ways his last will and testament. Half a 
million copies of his 1975 book, "The Monkey Wrench Gang," have been sold, and 
I want to set its many readers at ease right now: This is a comic last will and 
testament. Or, as the "author's warning" notes: 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who takes this book seriously will be shot. Anyone who does not take it 
seriously will be buried alive by a Mitsubishi bulldozer." 
</P>
<P>
The troubles are pretty simple. Bishop Dudley Love of Alkalai County, Utah, is 
fronting for the nuclear industry's Syn Fuels Corp., and right now Goliath, a 
$37-million drag line, is crawling like death toward Lost Eden Canyon in its 
quest for more of America to strip-mine and lay waste to. The Bishop's getting 
old too (he does digitalis like a cokehead because of his bad ticker), but he's 
still randy enough to be squiring a lady cop as his future second wife. 
</P>
<P>
The book spins on efforts to halt the giant machine -- "high as a hotel and 
taller than a grain elevator, heavier than 150 Boeing 727 jet liners, wide as a 
railroad barn or wider than six Caterpillar D-9 tractors lined end-to-end, with 
enough power to supply electricity for a city of 100,000!" The 
anarchist-environmental group, Earth First!, tries to stop the beast's progress 
with a demonstration, civil disobedience and the like. Naturally, they get 
their heads busted. Or, as Doc Sarvis explains: "They'll last until they become 
effective. Then the state moves in, railroads some of the leaders into prison, 
murders a few others for educational purposes, clubs and gasses and jails the 
followers and voila! -- peace and order are restored." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like work for the Monkey Wrench Gang! And so they saddle up for one more 
good hit against the . . . against the what? Against the crazed industrial 
death dance of America, against "the Enemy. The point . . . is to increase 
their costs, nudge them toward net loss, bankruptcy, forcing them to withdraw 
and retreat from their invasion of our public lands, our wilderness, our native 
and primordial home. . . ." And why -- oh, Lord, why -- should anyone destroy 
nice labor-saving machines? Well, "You do your needed work out of love, the 
love that dare not speak its name, the love of spareness, beauty, open space, 
clear skies and flowing streams, grizzly bear, mountain lion, wolf pack and 
twelve pack, of wilderness and wanderlust and primal human freedom and so 
forth." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds pretty grim? Don't worry. I laughed out loud reading this book -- not 
the least at Abbey's periodic appearance in the text as "that seedy old buzzard 
from nowhere who called himself 'a literary journalist' and sometimes appeared 
at events like this, listening carefully, nodding, smiling, deaf as a stump, 
taking notes, getting his facts wrong but interviewing the prettier women at 
exhaustive length, exploiting public bravery for private profit and calling it 
. . . calling it what? He called it Art. Nobody knew his name, but his T-shirt 
read 'Readin' Rots the Mind.' " 
</P>
<P>
And then there are these intrusions by some dolt called the "author" -- "She 
wore -- but who cares except the author? -- faded Levi britches shrunken to a 
perfect fit (and what they fit was perfect). . . ." Which brings up another 
point: Yes, once again, Edward Abbey has something in here to offend everyone 
-- women, various ethnic groups, types of cooking, brands of automobiles, you 
name it. 
</P>
<P>
There are some surprises: a savage parody of an Earth First! rendezvous by the 
author whose work helped spawn the group; a chapter inside Bonnie Abbzug's mind 
on that pitiful farce called men that echoes the less graphic efforts of James 
Joyce's "Molly Bloom." And violence. Four men die in this book and the blood is 
real. Women get their heads bashed in by cops. Children scream in terror. There 
is a chilling sense of prophecy amid the high jinks -- after all, Earth First! 
was busted by the FBI a month or so after Abbey's death last March, a bust that 
ended a two- or three-year surveillance that produced 1,200 hours of 
tape-recorded conversations. 
</P>
<P>
And there is the "Code of the Eco-Warrior," admonishing that proper actions 
result in no one getting hurt, no one getting caught, and "if you do get caught 
you're on your own. Nobody goes your bail. Nobody hires you a lawyer. Nobody 
pays your fine." The book fails to live up to these standards, as does life. 
</P>
<P>
Is it any good? Yes, because the damn thing is alive. When you finish, the tale 
lives on in your head, which is the most a book can do. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't a sequel, this is a parting shot by a man you have to believe knew 
he would soon be dead (read the painful page-and-a-half dedication). Or is he 
dead? In this caper, as in the earlier one, folks have a way of rising up from 
the horizon and melting into the mist. 
</P>
<P>
Earth First! recently published a posthumous portrait of Abbey as a vulture 
wheeling in the sky, a fine cigar firmly clasped in his grinning beak, a couple 
of sticks of lit dynamite clutched by his feet. Read the book and then we'll 
talk. Hey, hand me a beer, there's the work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
Or, as Abbey explains: "The urge to destroy that which is evil, said anarchist 
Prince Bakunin, is a creative urge. How true. How bloody awful true."

BEIJING JEEP THE SHORT, UNHAPPY ROMANCE OF AMERICAN BUSINESS IN CHINA BY JIM 
MANN (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $19.95; 311 PP.; O-671-62027-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan B. Levine, Levine, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., 
has worked on business development in China, and has also worked and studied in 
Taiwan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Enchanted by the vision of an ocean of consumers and cheap laborers, American 
businesses rushed to China 10 years ago when diplomatic relations were 
re-established. Now disillusioned, many of these businesses are reevaluating 
their ventures in the Middle Kingdom. Yet China was then, and still is, a land 
of potentially great rewards where caution and patience can yield profitable 
results. 
</P>
<P>
How then did so many experienced business people fumble on both sides of the 
Pacific? Using American Motors Corp. for his case study, Jim Mann ably 
chronicles a decade of earnest enterprise, grave misunderstanding and serious 
self-delusion among American business people in China. 
</P>
<P>
Now that markets in Russia and Eastern Europe beckon, the lessons that AMC and 
other firms learned can serve as guidelines for future dealings in this newly 
opened "socialist" world. We should be mindful that our competitors in Japan 
and Europe always stand ready to capitalize on our lost chances. 
</P>
<P>
The former Beijing bureau chief for the Los Angeles Times, Mann tells an 
engaging tale of American Motors' joint venture in China, from its hasty, 
optimistic inception in 1979 to the present period of frank reevaluation. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of AMC is a good one. Often touted as the model for all 
Sino-American ventures, AMC's ground-breaking deal seemed to have something for 
everyone: respectable short-term profits for AMC with glorious long-term 
possibilities, and swift modernization for its joint venture partner, Beijing 
Automotive Works. AMC had the tools and the know-how, China the labor and the 
promise of unlimited sales. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has tried to do business in China will read "Beijing Jeep" with 
recognition and nostalgia -- recognition of a shared experience of daily life 
in Beijing and nostalgia for an era lost in the debris of the Tian An Men 
Square Massacre on June 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Those who never have been to China will find in this book a revealing and 
enjoyable portrayal of the Chinese working world, from the negotiating table to 
the assembly line. Equally instructive is Mann's hard look at the workings of 
American business, including the costly and classic schism between overseas 
operations and the home office. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most fundamental Western misconception about the Chinese is that 
they can be forced to respond to Western business methods and attitudes. As the 
author points out, what was true for the British in the late 1800s still holds 
today -- China is at best a reluctant consumer of foreign goods. "We have never 
set much store in strange or ingenious objects, nor do we need any more of your 
country's manufactures," wrote Chinese Emperor Qianlong in a 1793 letter to 
England's King George III. It's a seminal point: Upheavals aside, most things 
still change slowly in China. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as business people dealing with any government well know, ideologies 
come and go, but bureaucracies are forever. Mann reminds us that it was ever 
thus: "China's intractable bureaucracy had stymied Mao and Deng just as it had 
the imperial and republican leaders who went before them." 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, AMC was in an economically frail position. In spite of a 
merger with French auto-maker Renault, the company was sustaining itself 
largely by sales of a single, very profitable product, the Jeep. So, when Todd 
Clare, AMC's vice president of international sales and self-styled "China 
hand," decided the time had come for the AMC jeep to be manufactured and sold 
in China, he was enthusiastically supported by senior AMC management. 
</P>
<P>
On paper at least, it seemed irresistible. With a population of 1 billion, 
China was certainly the largest new market in the world. Even if local sales 
flagged, labor costs near 34 cents per hour promised a highly competitive 
product for export to nearby Asian countries. 
</P>
<P>
The deal looked good to the Chinese as well. They saw an opportunity to acquire 
Western technology, build up foreign exchange and replace their aging 
Soviet-designed jeeps, used by the military and civilian work units, with an 
entirely new model designed and built with AMC expertise. 
</P>
<P>
The original 1979 memo of understanding was nothing if not promising. It laid 
out, Mann writes, "the broad objectives: to improve the quality of the Chinese 
jeep, to introduce a new family of jeeps made under AMC's directions, and to 
begin manufacturing parts and components in China to export." 
</P>
<P>
It was all so simple! "Clare was dazzled by the speed with which they had 
reached the agreement. My God, he had only been in China for seventy-two hours, 
and boom, crash, everything's fine, it was all done. China was going to be much 
easier than they expected. Clare thought this was going to be a pushover." What 
Clare did not realize is that the Chinese consider such memos routine 
courtesies designed to initiate a relationship, not define it. In a sense, the 
Chinese were just being polite. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, both sides had conveniently overlooked some important details. For 
one thing, with an average annual take-home pay of less than $1,000, Chinese 
consumers weren't likely to spend $19,000 for a Jeep Cherokee. Even if large 
organizations, such as civilian work units or the powerful People's Liberation 
Army, had the money, they weren't authorized to use precious foreign exchange 
to buy the American-sourced product. Understandably, AMC wanted payment in 
foreign exchange for the very good reason that the local currency, renminbi, is 
worthless outside of China. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, the new partners plunged ahead to form their joint venture called 
Beijing Jeep. As Mann tells it, while each side loudly proclaimed the mutual 
benefits of their enterprise, in fact neither side had any intention of living 
up to the letter of the original agreement. The Chinese wanted only the 
technology, not the product; AMC paid lip service to transferring technology 
but really wanted the sales. 
</P>
<P>
That Beijing Jeep did not officially launch its operations until six years 
after the initial agreement was signed was a strong hint that China is not the 
"pushover" that Todd Clare thought it was. 
</P>
<P>
A major miscalculation was the mistaken, but widely held, belief that "old 
friends" would be rewarded for their early generosity and patience. Like any 
savvy negotiators, the Chinese exploited this myth by playing one "friend" 
against another. In fact, according to Mann, Beijing Jeep's start-up delay was 
in part due to the Chinese using the AMC agreement as a negotiating ploy in a 
potential deal with Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
Another misconception was that high short-term costs were justified by the 
potential for great long-term gains. The Chinese tested this cavalier approach 
every chance they got. With convertible foreign currency in short supply, the 
Chinese government exploited every opportunity to generate foreign exchange. 
Meeting virtually no resistance among the stampeding Westerners, every year the 
Beijing government coolly hiked the prices of all services used by foreigners, 
from hotel rooms to telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Our gold-rush mentality now seems shockingly naive. Mann writes: "American 
business leaders tended not to examine (their) assumptions. There was a 
mystique, a romance about the China market that transcended all logic and 
caused the board chairmen to suspend their normal, everyday business 
judgments." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of AMC, this suspension of normal business judgment nearly resulted 
in the demise of Beijing Jeep. Only by the use of unorthodox tactics was AMC 
able to force limited success from its ill-conceived business strategy. 
</P>
<P>
After discovering that the costs of designing and building an entirely new 
Chinese jeep were prohibitive, AMC decided that the only profitable course was 
to sell ready-to-assemble Cherokee kits. This way, AMC made money twice: once 
from the sale of the kits, and again from the sale of the assembled Jeeps. 
</P>
<P>
There remained the problem of payment in foreign exchange. AMC's solution: Get 
the attention of top Chinese authorities by escalating the problem to the level 
of an international incident through a well-orchestrated manipulation of the 
American press. Even then, the good offices of a lucky contact close to 
then-premier Zhao Ziyang were required before AMC was guaranteed 
foreign-exchange payments. 
</P>
<P>
With visiting dignitaries, including then Vice President George Bush and 
Secretary of the Treasury Jim Baker, dropping in for tours of the Beijing Jeep 
assembly line, the Chinese were willing to pay the price for a model 
relationship. Other companies were not as fortunate. Absent similar special 
favors, many Western companies have been quite willing to reexamine their China 
enterprises, especially in the wake of the Tian An Men Square massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Though an important and well-told tale, "Beijing Jeep" suffers from a non-fatal 
case of ethnocentrism. Mann does make an effort to report the Chinese side of 
things, and overall, his sympathies lie with AMC and the American business 
community. AMC's exaggerated promises somehow come across as more forgivable 
than do those of the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
This book may give some readers the impression that the China market is 
hopeless. Not so. As someone who has worked in China on a variety of 
transactions, from TV sales to equity joint ventures, I am convinced that with 
patience and persistence we can do profitable business with the Chinese. To be 
sure, they are tough negotiators, but if a deal makes sense, they certainly can 
say yes and mean it. It would be unwise for American businesses to be daunted 
by the long march toward lucrative commerce in China, Eastern Europe or the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
If we do not compete aggressively in these countries, we will ultimately weaken 
our position in international business, and we'll lose in the long run to savvy 
competitors less fearful of the complexities of international trade. 
</P>
<P>
As American companies return to Beijing and begin to evaluate opportunities in 
newly opened Eastern-bloc nations, they would be wise to learn from their 
colleagues' hard-won experiences in China. For starters, they should pick up a 
copy of "Beijing Jeep."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Turning yesterday's headlines into today's docudramas, NBC and ABC bring a pair 
of fact-based stories to the small screen this week. 
</P>
<P>
NBC presents "Drug Wars: The Camarena Story," a three-part miniseries about the 
death of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique (Kiki) Camarena airing 
from 9 to 11 p.m. Sunday through Tuesday on Channels 4, 36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug Wars" tells of Camarena (played by Steven Bauer), who in 1985 was 
tortured for information and murdered by the drug lords he was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Pena (on the cover with Bauer) co-stars as Camarena's wife. 
</P>
<P>
Competing against Part 2 of "Drug Wars" at 9 p.m. Monday (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42) is "Rock Hudson," an ABC biography focusing on the actor who died of AIDS 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Ian Griffith portrays Hudson in the two-hour film. The supporting cast 
includes Andrew Robinson as Hudson's agent Henry Willson; Diane Ladd as his 
mother, Kay Fitzgerald, and William R. Moses as Marc Christian, the actor's 
companion during the last few years of his life.

RICHARD EDER: THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL; 
</P>
<P>
ORDINARY MONEY BY LOUIS B. JONES (VIKING: $18.95; 345 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Ordinary Money," Louis B. Jones writes old-fashioned verities in 
arrestingly original fashion. To spell out just what these verities are would 
be self-defeating, since it would make "Ordinary Money" sound like a sermon, 
which it is not. It satirizes the futility with which money and pleasure are 
pursued in our culture, but it delivers the message through the delicately 
far-fetched things that befall two ordinary American families when 20 million 
dollars are mysteriously dumped upon one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne and Randy, who were high school buddies and are still friends, live in 
the brackish lower reaches of the American Dream, and in an unfashionable part 
of Marin County. Wayne is a house painter; a long-suffering, dependable man 
undependably employed. Randy is itchy and mercurial and holds a variety of 
nondescript jobs. Both would like to be rich and don't expect to be. 
</P>
<P>
Through an ad, Randy goes to work for Bim Auctor, small and finely built, who, 
as his name suggests, could have come from outer space but is actually a mad 
genius. One day, Auctor tells Randy to take charge of 10 crates containing 1 
million 20-dollar bills and deposit them in safe-deposit boxes under his own 
name. Auctor, who cannot be contacted, will send him further instructions. 
Meanwhile, Randy is to spend what he needs as if the money were his own. 
</P>
<P>
Auctor is never heard from again. Randy goes on a restless and unsatisfactory 
spending binge. The money seems imaginary; so do his new big house and red 
Ferrari. Eventually, a group of federal agents catches up with him and 
questions him, but then seem curiously hesitant about making an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
This part of the plot -- its major strand one might say, and an ingenious one 
-- develops around the question of whether the money is real or counterfeit. 
Rigorous tests show no flaws. This does not mean it is real, though. Auctor 
seems to have developed a method of producing perfect forgeries. This is so 
alarming, so potentially destabilizing to the national and international 
economies, that it may be better for the government to pretend it is real and 
let Randy keep it. 
</P>
<P>
There is a wicked dose of social satire in all this, along with some intriguing 
questions: How real is money anyway? How real is the pursuit of it; how real is 
what it buys? When Randy's daughter, Cindy -- we will come to her in a moment 
-- receives an expensive motor scooter, it makes her sick to the stomach. Love 
is what she needs. The comic spectacle of federal agents, lawyers, mysterious 
academics and high-level officials arguing over what to do -- while Randy goes 
on shopping joylessly -- is more than comedy. 
</P>
<P>
If a message, somewhere between funny spoof and sharp parable, is the 
organizing principle of "Ordinary Money," the book is considerably more than 
that. Randy, though useful and funny, is fairly thin. But Jones, somewhat in 
the style of Stanley Elkin, knows how to make some remarkably rounded and 
touching characters flourish among his messages. 
</P>
<P>
Money, success, liberation, self-gratification are the desiccating fevers in 
Jones' America. Randy dries up; so does his awful divorced wife, Mary, a 
monster of fashionable selfishness with a fount of cliches about inner space, 
liberation and self-fulfillment. 
</P>
<P>
Cindy, their daughter, is their sad and appealing victim. Nobody has time for 
her; she keeps a collection of suicide notes and ransom notes stuffed inside 
her Kermit doll; she takes them out sometimes and reads them. And when Randy 
briefly abducts her for a trip to England, she checks to see if her mother has 
carried out her threat to put out a Missing Child notice. When she discovers 
that she hasn't bothered, she is heart-broken; and our hearts develop their own 
stress lines. 
</P>
<P>
And we still have not reached Wayne, the book's bitter, puzzled and beautifully 
drawn hero. He aches; he desperately wants money; he struggles against the 
knowledge that he will never make very much. Kim, his daughter, was born with a 
harelip and a missing nipple; the plastic surgery that has restored her 
wholeness has left him with colossal medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
He is tempted to take some of Randy's money. He keeps opening up the crate of 
bills Randy has left in his garage. Laid off as a house painter, he is suckered 
into working for a telemarketing operation that swindles those who work for it 
in hopes of making a fortune. Jones is fiendishly clever at describing the 
swindle and the supersalesman who cons Wayne into putting his wife's savings -- 
all they own -- into it. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne is a battleground. He is prey to the dream of success and the other 
fashionable lusts of the age. He dabbles at seduction with a bar pick-up; 
suddenly, they find themselves in her apartment having -- to their mutual 
relief -- nothing more than a little wine and a friendly chat. And finally 
Wayne pulls back, goes to work for himself as a house painter and accepts his 
wife's pregnancy, which up to then had seemed like one more persecution. 
Ordinary money is worth far more than outer-space millions. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne draws much of his strength from Laura, his wife. She is spunky, sexy and 
utterly independent of the illusions around her. She is also written with a 
shade too much of familiar wonderfulness. Kim, on the other hand, is a burning 
original. She flowers out of her handicap. "How could anyone understand how it 
feels to be the girl of whom there are no baby pictures?" she asks in pain. By 
the end, she has healed herself into an earnest and charming love affair with 
the school nerd. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't all work. The end is too sweet. There is an insipid and diluting 
side-plot about a conceptual artist and his eccentric English father. It takes 
a little effort to figure out just what the government people are up to in 
their concern over the 20 million dollars. Their elliptical dialogue is 
comically appropriate, but it also clouds things. 
</P>
<P>
Still, to be smart, funny, uplifting, tender and merciless, all at once, is a 
remarkable achievement for one novel -- particularly, for a first one.

ISN'T THE REAL WALL ST. INTERESTING ENOUGH?;

<TEXT>
<P>
You could almost make a case that Wall Street has been ignored in literature. 
"Bonfire of the Vanities" was the first important novel on the subject to be 
published in 50 years. The last one before that was Dos Passos' "The Big Money" 
(1936). These two are the only major works that come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there's been only a smattering of minor works that could be called 
literary -- Louis Auchincloss' "The Embezzler," a satirical play called "The 
Henrietta" and a lighthearted poem, "Pan in Wall Street," all written decades 
ago, and all of which could fit into into a single briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
Upton Sinclair, who specialized in capitalism, wrote novels about the meat 
packers and the coal barons but not about the stock market, and few characters 
from fine novels ever have even worked on Wall Street. There's Nick Carraway 
from "The Great Gatsby," a bond trader, and then Tom Wolfe's bond trader -- but 
who else? No writer has done for the stockbroker what Sinclair Lewis did for 
the real-estate agent or Arthur Miller for the traveling salesman, and the last 
interesting bookkeeper to come out of a novel is Uriah Heep. 
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of Wall Street novel is curious, considering that Wall Street is 
the capital of capitalism where fortunes are won and lost every day, where 45 
million of us are directly invested and millions more are indirectly involved. 
Enough nonfiction books on investing are published each year to fill several 
library shelves, and readers have an insatiable appetite for financial stories 
in magazines. Why is it, then, that these money-making dramas are so rarely 
played out in fiction? 
</P>
<P>
One explanation is that financial maneuverings on Wall Street are so 
complicated that to describe them correctly and still hold a reader's interest 
is next to impossible. It's no problem for the how-to writer who knows he has a 
captive audience: People will slog through hundreds of incomprehensible pages 
if they think there's a profit in it. Not so with a novel. By the time you've 
explained how your main character, a futures and options speculator, hedges his 
long position by selling baskets of stocks he doesn't own, you've lost the 
narrative drive and nobody much cares what happens to him. 
</P>
<P>
A second explanation is that the people who write novels have it in their heads 
that Wall Street is very dull. I don't know where this notion got started, but 
it certainly was shared by all the participants in every creative writing class 
I took -- at Yale, even, which is a regular boot camp for Wall Street. Whenever 
we had to describe an interesting subject in 300 words or less, the subject 
always was a hot dog vendor or a lady sleeping on a park bench, and never an 
investment banker, a mergers-and-acquisitions specialist, a securities analyst. 
The professors didn't actually say Wall Street was dull, but the artsy 
viewpoint was that financial types were unromantic and shallow, not to mention 
piggy, and could hardly inspire a mediocre short essay, not to mention a 
350-page opus. 
</P>
<P>
When we went to New York on a creative-writing trip, it was not to visit Wall 
Street at the opening bell but rather the Fulton Fish market at 5 a.m. There 
was something worth being creative about. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know this for a fact, but I wouldn't be surprised if such diverse 
talents as Updike, Hemingway, Salinger and Bellow also believed that Wall 
Street was dull, or else they would have at some point put it in a story. Since 
baseball, fishing, adolescence and being Jewish appealed as subjects to these 
great writers, then Wall Street must have seemed terrifically boring for them 
to have overlooked it. 
</P>
<P>
(I went to school in the late 1960s, when the idea of Wall Street's being dull 
was widely accepted. In the recent college classes, where there's wild 
enthusiasm for the $250,000 starting salaries on Wall Street and 75% of the 
students aspire to careers in mergers and acquisitions, perhaps Wall Street has 
become more popular in the writing seminars). 
</P>
<P>
The truth of the matter is that Wall Streeters do, in fact, try as hard as they 
can to appear to be dull. They accomplish this by all wearing the same tan 
Burberries and dark suits, carrying the same burgundy briefcases, behaving 
predictably at public functions, and saying nothing to reporters that is 
remotely odd or controversial. This helps along the impression that they aren't 
really worth writing about, and may have kept the better novelists off their 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
This brings us to "Rascal Money," a new Wall Street novel that if nothing else 
ought to be praised for simply having been written. On the other hand, the 
author, described in the publicity blurb as a "well-respected business 
analyst," must think that Wall Street is pretty boring himself. I'm presuming 
this because of the considerable effort he makes to jazz up his story with 
silly characters, including a mobster named Guiseppe Verrazano (alias Joey the 
Bridge), a Hopi Indian, a demented computer hacker, two bumbling KGB agents, 
several thugs from the Japanese Order of the Chrysanthemum, an advertising 
executive who batters her husbands and leaves them in traction, and a CEO's 
wife who writes pornographic novels on the side. 
</P>
<P>
The basic plot -- small and unprofitable company run by inept manager attempts 
to acquire large and profitable company run by very capable manager -- is 
exactly the kind of thing we've been reading about in the newspaper, but here 
it's lost in gratuitous nonsense. A big crane falls on corporate headquarters, 
the KGB agents try to assassinate the computer hacker, General MacArthur is 
dragged up from the Inchon Landing, a Hollywood producer attempts to seduce 
adoring starlets at lunch, and there are stories within stories from Icelandic 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
Also, we're introduced briefly to a gay Jesuit prom queen; Daphne X, a black 
woman who's against sexism; Rama Krishna Shapiro, a "saffron-robed wellness 
therapist," and a banker named Nick Lee, whose real name turns out to be 
Nicodemus Leibowitz even though his parents are Anglicans. These are only a few 
of the silly characters -- caricatures mostly -- who detract from the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Rascal Money" could have been a satire, except that half the time it's trying 
to be serious, and by then it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
My purpose is not to criticize this uneven first effort, but simply to point 
out that it's one more example of a novel that isn't really about Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, with Boesky in jail and Bilzerian convicted, Milken 
indicted, Warner chasing Time, Time chasing Warner, Warner chasing Paramount, 
Kravis suing Kohlberg (or is it the other way around?), Pickens raiding Japan, 
Japan buying the Rockefellers, and Campeau nearly ruined, who needs Wall Street 
fiction, anyway?

The Industrial Areas Foundation organizations in Southern California (UNO, 
SCOC, EVO and VOICE) have been created with a vision of people with various 
racial and ethnic backgrounds working together to solve common problems facing 
urban America. In 1984, United Neighborhoods Organization, based in East Los 
Angeles, and the Southern California Organizing Committee, based in South 
Central, signed a Covenant of Unity in the presence of 7,000 African-American 
and Latino leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Kotkin's "Fear and Reality in the Los Angeles Melting Pot" (Nov. 5) 
contained an unfortunate misquote and misinterpretation of a remark by SCOC 
leader Fritizer Hopkins. ("The jobs that used to go to blacks are now going to 
Latinos.") 
</P>
<P>
The new service economy -- so visible in Southern California -- has created a 
great many new jobs. Most of these jobs are low-paying; many are filled by 
recent immigrants. Our organizations have demonstrated a commitment to the 
workers filling these new jobs. A pluralistic society, which respects the 
dignity of all individuals, is at the heart of our value system.

BOLD PROSE FROM A BRILLIANT POET; 
</P>
<P>
THREE PATHS TO THE LAKE STORIES BY INGEBORG BACHMANN TRANSLATED BY MARY FRAN 
GILBERT INTRODUCTION BY MARK ANDERSON (MODERN GERMAN VOICES SERIES) (HOLMES 
&amp; MEIER: $24.50; 212 PP.;) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Slocum Hinerfeld, Hinerfeld contributes frequently to The Times Book 
Review. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his introduction to "Three Paths to the Lake," Mark Anderson says that 
German-language critics labeled Ingeborg Bachmann's stories Frauengeschichten. 
The label was derogatory: just women's stories, the critics meant; women's 
stories, and no more. 
</P>
<P>
The critics were disappointed. They knew Bachmann as a brilliant poet, one "who 
had written a doctoral dissertation on Heidegger, inaugurated a series of 
influential lectures on modern European literature at the University of 
Frankfurt, and whose sophisticated verse had won for her -- at an enviably 
early age -- all the major German and Austrian Literary prizes." 
</P>
<P>
John Wain, professor of poetry at Oxford, wrote that people expect poets to 
have "some power of perception, as well as of expression, beyond the ordinary 
human range." Ingeborg Bachmann had that power. 
</P>
<P>
But Bachmann shifted to prose. The stories of "The Thirtieth Year" were 
published in 1961. The novel "Malina" appeared in 1971. "Three Paths to the 
Lake" with its five stories was published in 1972, and an unfinished novel 
cycle called "Death Styles" appeared posthumously in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
The women of "Three Paths to the Lake" all have some connection to Vienna and 
to one another, and all are victims, if only of themselves. To people who read 
the poetry with strict attention, but who skimmed the prose, it seemed of 
another and lower order. The women were neurotic; their stories were banal. 
</P>
<P>
To these admirers of the poetry, says Anderson, the prose work had "no apparent 
narrative energy, focus or significance." That, of course, was precisely 
Bachmann's point: Modern life as these women lived it lacked significance. 
</P>
<P>
The erstwhile admirers, Anderson writes, found the very language of the fiction 
alien to "the bitingly laconic modernism" of Bachmann's poems. 
</P>
<P>
But whose language was it? An author is not necessarily the narrator or any 
character in his or her work of action. The words on the page are meant to be 
the words of fictive creatures. True, the writer has written the words, but 
written them in an act of ascription, to attribute qualities. Landscape, mood 
and tone all must accord with the nature of the work. So too must style, that 
mysterious trace of an author's character that marks a fiction as the grain 
marks wood. 
</P>
<P>
Bachmann's voice was muted for the fiction's sake. Her talent was not failing 
but growing. 
</P>
<P>
Once a poet, always a poet: Why did the critics not see it? Bachmann's prose is 
a fine tissue made of narrative; of dialogue within and without quotation 
marks; of written but unspoken thought. 
</P>
<P>
Characters reappear, references recur, systems of metaphor imprint their coded 
messages. In the long story called "Word for Word," words, phrases and shards 
of conversation are untranslated from their several languages. 
</P>
<P>
The writing is bold, experimental, even subversive. It requires prior general 
knowledge, and it requires that a reader work. 
</P>
<P>
It would help to know one's way in Bachmann's culture. Even without a cultural 
map, the stories are rich and stunning, but one is grateful to Mark Anderson 
for showing the way, for generous helpings of background information and 
erudition, and for his translation of short passages from languages other than 
the German. 
</P>
<P>
The translation of the text itself, by Mary Fran Gilbert, climbs without 
hesitation to moments of climax and revelation, which are the test of a 
translator's skill and nerve. 
</P>
<P>
In the story "Eyes to Wonder," the heroine refuses to wear glasses. Of course 
she cannot cope with contact lenses. With her glasses, "Miranda can see into 
hell." Life is grotesque. Miranda might see things she won't be able to forget. 
</P>
<P>
Miranda means full of wonder. Its Latin roots are twined. Mirare means to look; 
Mirari, to wonder. Together they connote amazement at what one sees. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you have your glasses?" asks her fiance. Miranda gropes in her purse. They 
must be at home. Or lost. Or broken -- all three pairs. Miranda's life is 
deliberately blurred; she will not see. 
</P>
<P>
The story is dedicated to the memory of Georg Groddeck, whom Anderson calls 
"the father of 'psychosomatic analysis.' " Groddeck believed that people choose 
their illnesses -- even to not seeing what they do not wish to see. 
</P>
<P>
For this extraordinary intellectual exercise, Bachmann had to invent a 
character to epitomize psychosomatic theory; to create an interesting story 
that was also a tenable case history. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond even this virtuosity, "Eyes to Wonder" has a reversed, 
through-the-looking-glass version in another story in the collection. In 
"Problems Problems," a young woman named Beatrix lives only to sleep and to 
visit the beauty parlor, where the walls mirror her image. "So that's me," she 
says to her reflection. Like Miranda, Beatrix finds the world unbearable. The 
mirrors that reflect Beatrix happen to be so called from the same Latin root 
words as the name Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
Nadja, the heroine of the dazzling story "Word for Word," is a simultaneous 
translator. She is "a strange mechanism," a filter for others' words and 
thoughts. A stranger even in her own country, she is an international drifter 
without the traditional comforts of family and home. Nadja cannot even cry. 
Perhaps she has "unlearned crying from traveling around in all those languages 
and places." Her faith has reverted to the pagan, and sometimes words fail her. 
</P>
<P>
The cover of "Three Paths to the Lake" has been designed to look like an 
international airmail letter. The envelope is watermarked with the usual thin 
blue lines, but here they are the whorls of a topographic map. The stamps are 
printed with the silhouette of a jet with the name of the publisher, Holmes 
&amp; Meier, and of the series of which this book is but one part, Modern 
German Voices. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the jet, it has taken a long time for this work to come to us in 
English. Bachmann's voice is rare and strong -- strong enough to transport us 
to a new domain of fiction.

CRITIC'S CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM SHALES, The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS began the '80s as the No. 1 network and begins the '90s as No. 3. The way 
things are going for the feisty Fox network, CBS could end the century as No. 
4. It's been a decade of humiliation for the one-time Tiffany's of television. 
"There is now no part of the CBS program schedule that is not hemorrhaging," 
notes Daily Variety, the show-biz trade paper. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, you may be seeing more obits for CBS than cover stories about 
Arsenio Hall -- and that's a heap o' press. But Howard Stringer, president of 
CBS Broadcast Group, claims a lot of the doomsaying about CBS is mere 
"mythology" and that prosperity is just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"We're thinking pretty sneakily confident at the moment that we've got things 
under control," Stringer says. 
</P>
<P>
What's his ray of hope? One of them is Jeff Sagansky, the Hollywood big shot 
who's just left the presidency of Tri-Star Pictures to take over CBS 
Entertainment. "I am thrilled with him," says Stringer. "I couldn't be 
happier." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood seems to be happy too. Sagansky's predecessor, Kim LeMasters, was 
unpopular with some producers, industry sources say. Sagansky, 37, is a 
well-liked take-charge guy. 
</P>
<P>
In early interviews, Sagansky, 37, sounds like a man who knows precisely what 
the network's problems are. A "sense of showmanship" has been lost, he told one 
reporter. "Everything is too low-key here. The shows are too safe. There's no 
excitement," Sagansky said. 
</P>
<P>
Stringer concedes he's right. CBS already has canceled a third of its new fall 
lineup. One of Sagansky's first official acts was to kill "Snoops," the Friday 
night snooze. "Some of the shows were too traditional," Stringer says. "We 
didn't take enough risks. We didn't reach out the way we should have." 
</P>
<P>
CBS has not introduced a big hit series since "Murder, She Wrote" in 1984. And 
that is a show that appeals mainly to viewers over 34, when it's the 
18-to-34-year-olds that are most desirable to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does CBS claim better days are just ahead, but executives say things 
are not quite so bleak as they appear. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to sit here and try to sell you the idea that this is a great 
year for CBS," says David F. Poltrack, the CBS vice president in charge of 
research. "We came into the year in third place and our goal was obviously to 
get out of it. While we have not made a major change, we have improved our 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Poltrack says that CBS is actually the only one of the three networks to have 
improved its ratings over the same period last year. NBC is down a little, ABC 
is exactly the same, and CBS has inched up a teeny-tiny notch. Further, the 
biggest woe at CBS had been the lack of successful 8 o'clock shows -- programs 
that air in the first hour of prime time and can serve as building blocks for a 
healthy night's programming. 
</P>
<P>
On six out of seven nights each week, CBS has improved on the 8 o'clock ratings 
it got last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Major Dad," on Monday nights, does about 10% better than "Newhart" did in that 
time slot a year ago. On Tuesday nights, "Rescue 911" registers a startling 90% 
increase over the low-rated "TV 101" of last season. On Wednesdays, "Peaceable 
Kingdom," lowly as it was, got 16% better ratings than "The Van Dyke Show" of 
1988. "Kingdom" came -- and went. It has now been replaced by the revised 
"Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
Friday night was the weakest link in this chain, and with "Snoops" gone, 
Poltrack and Stringer think that will improve too. The replacement show is "Max 
Monroe: Loose Cannon," an action-adventure starring Shadoe Stevens, one-time 
"Hollywood Square." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, one might ask (and I did), if there's all this improvement, why 
isn't Kim LeMasters still in his job? "If you look at this year versus last 
year, you would say Kim basically played even with the other guys," says 
Poltrack. "The problem is, obviously, when you're in third place, parity is not 
acceptable. You have to outperform the other guys to catch up. And that we 
didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
So Jeff Sagansky has come down the chimney to save the day -- greeted as 
eagerly by CBS executives as kids welcoming Santa. It remains to be seen just 
what goodies he'll be leaving under the tree and in all those forlorn empty 
stockings.

<P>
Twenty-one young black brothers that died just for fun 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wake up, young black brother, our race is dying, can't you see? 
</P>
<P>
The war you should be fighting is with them, not with me 
</P>
<P>
Fight that war on drugs, and you know there is a war on crime 
</P>
<P>
That's what's killing us, brother, and destroying all our young minds 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
You kill a black brother, then I kill one and flee 
</P>
<P>
And give them another reason to put their killer on our streets 
</P>
<P>
But we're killing the most, and letting them kill the rest 
</P>
<P>
In this war you are killing my people, so there's no winner and no best. 
</P>

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: A GOOD DRESSING-DOWN; 
</P>
<P>
POKING THROUGH WHAT MAY BE CLOSETED REASONS FOR AN ANNUAL SARTORIAL SNUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
ONCE AGAIN, a year has rolled around, and the Tailors Council of America has 
published its annual list of the "Ten Best Dressed Men in America." 
</P>
<P>
And once again they have seen fit to leave me out. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years, at least, I have eagerly awaited the list, hoping to find myself 
included among the most sartorially noteworthy of American men. I have been 
repeatedly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
If I were not, by nature, inclined to think the best of my fellow men, I would 
suspect the tailors of prejudice against individuals of my profession and 
economic level. 
</P>
<P>
I notice that, as usual, the 10 best are all successful in their fields, and 
presumably men of means. It is true, I suppose, that to dress really well a man 
needs a liberal bank account. But it seems to me that the tailors ought to make 
room on their list for one or two men whose good taste supersedes their 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
I grant that I am not poor, but I doubt that I would spend more money on 
clothes even if I became rich. I don't think a man needs $800 suits and $200 
shoes to look sharp. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps I was excluded again because there was no category for journalists. The 
closest categories were comedy (Don Rickles) and television (Arsenio Hall). I 
suppose television would include such news anchors as Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather 
and Peter Jennings, but it obviously does not include newspaper columnists and 
reporters. Are we pariahs? 
</P>
<P>
Other categories were government, Mario Cuomo; motion pictures, Michael 
Douglas; sports, Pat Riley; industry, Malcolm Forbes; business, Michael Milken; 
design, Mr. Blackwell; entrepreneurial, Donald Trump, and music, Placido 
Domingo. 
</P>
<P>
As far as I know, all those gentlemen are snappy dressers, and I don't resent 
their selection. Honesty requires that I examine my own wardrobe for some fatal 
flaw, some gauche costume that left the tailors no choice but to include me 
out. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if it could be the lime-green jacket my wife ordered for me from a 
mail-order house. It's light, fresh and pretty and fits fairly well, except for 
a kind of hunch between the shoulder blades. But it isn't easy to find 
accouterments suitable for a lime-green jacket. Maybe one of the tailors' 
scouts saw me that time my gray slacks were at the cleaner's and I wore the 
lime-green jacket with blue slacks. I have seen lime green and blue in nature 
(lime-bearing trees against a blue sky), but on a man they don't look too good. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I might have been blackballed because of my pale plaid jacket. Its colors 
are pink, green, gray and yellow. I bought it off the rack for $50. But the 
first day I wore it, alas, I put an uncapped pen in the breast pocket and it 
leaked a large black stain. The cleaner couldn't quite get it out. Not that 
that kept me from wearing it. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect, though, that I was undone the night I spoke at a dinner in the Four 
Seasons Hotel. That's just the sort of place the tailors' scouts would haunt. 
It was black tie. My tuxedo is 10 or 15 years old but still serviceable. What I 
didn't know, though, until my wife pointed it out, was that I had forgotten my 
cummerbund. My pleated dress shirt tended to pooch out under the jacket button. 
That certainly would have been enough to disqualify me. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it might not have been my formal attire that did me in but 
my athletic attire. I suppose what one wears to the gym is as important as what 
one wears to a black-tie dinner. I admit that I have been rather careless in 
the togs I wear when I work out. I sometimes wear a T-shirt that says, "How can 
I be expected to cope with life when I can't even program my VCR?" But I think 
it would be petty of the tailors to disqualify me because of my technical 
ineptitude. 
</P>
<P>
I can think of only one other thing. It might be my shoes. Ever since I 
suffered nerve damage in my right leg, I have worn a pair of black deerskin 
shoes. They are very soft and pliable. It is true that after several years they 
have become wrinkled and shabby looking. I wear them with every outfit, 
whatever its color. I wear them with my tux. 
</P>
<P>
So that's probably it. They won't select me as one of the 10 best dressed 
because my shoes are tacky. 
</P>
<P>
It's either that or they're prejudiced against newspapermen. It is the nature 
of our jobs that we are always being thrust into different environments, at 
different social levels -- a Skid Row murder in the morning, an interview with 
an ambassador in the afternoon. It is difficult to dress properly for all 
contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
It was once said of journalist Heywood Broun that he looked like an unmade bed. 
Don't we all?

FICTION IN BRIEF: CAVERNS BY O. U. LEVON (PENGUIN BOOKS: $8.95; 327 PP.)

A 1930s-style mystery collectively written by 13 students in Ken Kesey's 
University of Oregon writing class, "Caverns" is based on a 1964 obituary: 
"DIED: Loach, Charles Oswald, Doctor of Theosophy and discoverer of so-called 
'Secret Cave of American Ancients,' which stirred archeological controversy in 
1928. After serving six years in San Quentin on a disputed murder charge, Loach 
was allowed to lead a second expedition in search of the site, the findings of 
which were judged scientifically inconclusive; -- of lung disease at his 
brother's ranch in Moab, Utah." 
</P>
<P>
To these rough outlines, the class added characters (notably two mystical 
sisters and an armadillo) and began the action as Loach emerges from prison. 
The result can't by any stretch of the imagination be called great literature, 
but it's an entertaining story of great inventiveness. One can't help prissily 
hoping, however, that the author of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" included 
in the lessons some discussion of the integrity of the novel -- and a caution 
that publishing a curiosity is not necessarily the same thing as being 
published.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hung up in echoing patterns of obsession, novelist Hubert Selby's heroes are 
forever trying to beat the system but find themselves doomed to a loser's 
world. Driven to escape a fatal confinement in material hells of New York City 
and in complex hells of Being, they mount violent, dark revolts, but are 
continually pulled back into the damned condition from which they started -- 
discovering, like Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, that "where we are is hell, / And 
where hell is we must ever be." 
</P>
<P>
In Selby's world of urban lost souls, individual identity is as much beside the 
point as it is for John Bunyan's "Everyman" or Samuel Beckett's "Unnameable." 
Suffering through endless "routines" of abjection as ultimate proof of the 
humility of a dehumanized humanity's humility before a nonexistent God, his 
protagonists drift in a fluid, hallucinatory haze of drive and phobia, lust and 
revulsion, sin and retribution, necessary crime and inevitable punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Headlong, stark and arresting, Selby's books have the energy, intensity and 
pain of alienated singular vision and an inexorable momentum of horror that is 
at once hypnotic and almost too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Selby is a self-taught writer who went from P.S. 102 in Brooklyn to the 
Merchant Marine to a long literary apprenticeship, working at odd jobs while 
moonlighting as a storyteller. His first book, "Last Exit to Brooklyn," won 
some fame -- and, due to its raw content, more notoriety -- in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
His three novels of the following decade -- "The Room" and "The Demon" (first 
published in 1971 and 1976, respectively) as well as "Requiem for a Dream" -- 
undeservedly received far less notice. Since then, he has published only one 
book, "The Song of the Silent Snow," a collection of short stories to which 
readers may wish to turn to find early rehearsals of the two novels here under 
review. 
</P>
<P>
In a significant sense, Selby's entire work comprises one overlapping tale, 
with interchangeable settings and a single central figure who, when given a 
name at all, always is called Harry. In "Last Exit," he is Harry Black, a union 
shop steward. In "The Demon," an almost perfect novel that may well be the 
writer's finest achievement, he is Harry White. 
</P>
<P>
White is an ambitious, upwardly mobile young corporate executive with the sex 
drive of a satyr, the inner tension of a tightly coiled spring and a 
sleepwalker's lack of self-knowledge. The latter deficiency, a tragic constant 
in Selby's scheme of the doomed, triggers a geometric progression toward 
despair whose finely calibrated gradations the novelist charts with terrifying, 
Dantesque precision. Harry may not know it, but each step in his climb up the 
success ladder, and each mechanical surrender to "the demon that was welling up 
inside him," adds to the burden of inarticulate grief, guilt and shame that 
will become his downfall. And the higher he climbs, the steeper will be his 
vertiginous tumble into the inferno. 
</P>
<P>
For Harry White, an automaton-like pursuit of sexual release with woman after 
woman is the only way of appeasing the inner demon. Sex for Harry is not 
passion but a convulsive compulsion, a wallowing in defilement that defers but 
does not remove a crushing weight of meaninglessness in his life. Each new 
conquest brings temporary relief that soon yields in turn to new cycles of 
tension, self-conflict and pain. An "ideal" marriage to a beautiful, loving 
wife, an executive vice presidency of his firm, a luxurious home in the 
suburbs, all the trappings of fortune are but fuel to Harry's insatiable demon. 
</P>
<P>
When the fall comes, Harry at first does a good job of concealment. A crack-up 
episode over lunch at the Banker's Club leads to a hospital visit, where, to 
his secret dismay, the doctors are able to find no physical explanation of his 
erratic behavior -- "no tumor. . . . Nothing. Just him." But soon his "night 
visits to hell" are becoming more and more desperate, his battles with the 
demon less and less successful. He turns from casual sex to petty theft to 
gratuitous murder, eventually finding himself immersed beyond all extrication 
in "the huge cesspool that he felt he was, and could not get away from." 
</P>
<P>
With Selby's careful prose taking on the accelerating force of catastrophe, 
Harry meets his fate in scenes of orgiastic violence and sacrificial 
self-immolation, an Easter Sunday murder of the Cardinal of New York on the 
altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral followed by a final suicidal plunge into the 
vortex of oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
Harry White's spasmodic attempt to penetrate the void of being, to force 
meaning out of the pointlessness of his life, brings him to self-revelation at 
last. As he dies, all the evasion and avoidance and "games" now swept away, he 
finds "the truth of his life suddenly thrust in front of him," his timetables 
of success obliterated in a timelessness of vision. 
</P>
<P>
It is out of a like timelessness that Selby's companion novel, "The Room," 
begins. A nameless prisoner, charged with a crime he may or may not have 
committed, speaks to us from his confinement in the remand cell where he is 
being held pending trial. His telling-over of the repetitive minutiae of 
abjection, his reveries exposing the repressed traumas of his childhood, the 
sexual warpings and stuntings of his adolescence, and his violent, imaginary 
revenges against his captors, make up a canticle of pain that reiterates the 
central truth of Selby's dark vision: The interior hell and its torments are at 
once the supreme proof of cosmic justice and of the absence of mercy from the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
In Dante's medieval conception, hell was located at the Earth's core, and thus 
farthest from the sun, stars and planets by which human time is told. For 
Selby's incarcerated hero, similarly, there is no time, only the unendurable 
weight of being -- "it just seems to drag and drag and weigh a ton. And hang on 
you like a monkey. Like it's going to suck the blood out of you. Or suck your 
guts out. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Selby is a seeker after the quality of mercy in an age ruled by the indifferent 
mechanics of quantity, a writer whose books defiantly refuse any such easy 
accommodation with the social order as is implied in the work of, say, John 
Updike; as Amiri Baraka once suggested, Selby's pages are populated by 
"Americans no character in a John Updike novel would be happy to meet." 
</P>
<P>
At a time when the most successful fiction is that which provides reassuring 
distraction from the difficult truths of existence, it is easy to see how the 
acute and agonized moral vision of a writer like Selby may go ignored by -- as 
culture critic Theodor Adorno once put it -- "those who would like to sleep 
through the deluge that threatens them." Selby's works unleash the darkness of 
the deluge.

THE MENAGERIE OF A MIDWIFE;

<P>
All praise for Mary Pjerrou's refusal to settle for the timid, the constrained, 
the narrow canvas of a safe first novel. Instead, she tries to corral within 
these pages a menagerie of ideas about feminism and Gnosticism and Hawking's 
time paradoxes and to yoke them all to a personal story of damage and healing. 
It's that huge ambition, I believe, that led the Mendocino Festival of Books to 
award "Coz" its 1989 prize. But only the very greatest of writers have the 
imaginative and intellectual force to make this kind of novel compelling and 
coherent; sadly, Pjerrou is not yet one of them. 
</P>
<P>
The narrator is Abby, a midwife on Only Mountain -- a setting purposely 
abstract, unconnected to any real place. Abby once loved a man who spurned her 
and became a priest. To punish him, she sterilized herself, but when she saw 
the work he dedicated his life to -- ministering to the wretched of the Earth 
-- she became a midwife to atone for cutting off "God's gift of life." 
</P>
<P>
The fantastic events Abby relates already have transpired, and now she's trying 
to find meaning in them. Called to assist at the birth of the 13th child of one 
of Mick Grady's wives, she finds the Grady clan a polygamous patriarchy and 
Grady himself the creator of an oddball religion that is a "hybrid flower of 
the patriarchal imagination based on Genesis and astronomy." Somehow, Grady 
progeny soon will populate the stars. Meanwhile, on Only Mountain, chaos -- 
literal and symbolic -- reigns among the Gradys. Goats stampede through the 
house, wives and children teem, and everywhere is unspeakable filth. 
</P>
<P>
One of the book's first problems is that Mick Grady doesn't ring true. Angry, 
self-absorbed, this quintessential male chauvinist has no charisma, no 
likabililty. The reader wonders what holds all these wives and grown children 
to him. He's here, it seems, only to symbolize male dominance. 
</P>
<P>
Counterpoised against Grady and his clan is old Coz, an aged "witch" as the 
Gradys call her, who lives on the mountain and who recently has "unbirthed" a 
baby -- a man who had adopted her as a child, grew old with her, then reversed 
the aging process until he became a mewling infant. Coz grew an umbilical cord 
and placenta and unbirthed him. Now Coz announces that she herself will go 
backward in time and that Abby has been chosen as her "precessor," the woman 
who will unbirth Coz. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the ultimate unreality of this reversal process, which even in 
context never seems less than absurd, there seems to be no logical reason why 
Abby -- not particularly admirable or sympathetic -- among all the women in the 
world should be chosen for this momentous task. For this unbirthing, Coz 
explains, is to have cosmic consequences. It will, at once, propel Mick Grady 
and his progeny to the stars from where their descendants will populate the 
universe (although that may well be one of Coz's lies). It also will usher in 
the beginning of a 2,000-year period during which Abby will live and grow wise, 
and then perhaps more "children of the earth" will be taken to the stars. 
</P>
<P>
As must be obvious by now, this plot is extremely difficult to follow. In part, 
that's because far too much of it is carried by talk. Not dialogue, talk. Coz 
discloses and explains and changes her story and expounds upon the universe and 
time ad nauseam. There is much speechifying about how going backward in time is 
closer to the natural order of things, but that dubious case is never proved. 
Abby and the man who is supposed to "unfather" (i.e. have sexual intercourse 
with Abby after the unbirthing) Coz argue and discuss incessantly. 
</P>
<P>
Another difficulty in following the book's spine lies in the often impenetrable 
language and Faulknerian sentences of these conversations, particularly when 
Coz expatiates. "After I am unborn of Abby," Coz says, "Dr. Kingman will 
unfather me. As he is now going backward, this double negative will stop my 
undoing, and will then bring you home to the universe chosen for you. Dr. 
Kingman will resume his forward-going life and become one of you, carrying with 
him the seed of travel which will be passed on to future generations through 
his children and will eventually recover its power like a recessive gene. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, a long overdue assertion of independence by the Grady women, just 
before Coz -- now an infant -- is to be unbirthed by Abby, destroys the plan. 
Remarkable events occur, which one either accepts in context or doesn't. Once 
again, for me they fail to convince. 
</P>
<P>
It's a bad sign when you keep asking yourself why certain things are happening 
and not getting an answer, when motivations are unclear, when plot strands seem 
to want to be related but don't quite make it. I admire Pjerrou for her 
seriousness of purpose and her long reach, but for me 'Coz's' reach far exceeds 
its grasp.

PRIVATE LIVES: GUMHEAD CONFIDENTIAL; 
</P>
<P>
KICKING THE NICORETTE GUM HABIT CAN PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR RIGHT MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGO KAUFMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
AFTER two days of suffering, I thought of a solution: Kill Moe. It wasn't that 
I disliked him -- quite the contrary, but he was the only barrier between me 
and a supply of my beloved Nicorette, the prescription chewing gum with 
nicotine that helped me quit smoking. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I liked Miss Nicky (the gum character in Doonesbury) much better than 
I ever liked Mr. Butts. When I smoked, I had to brush my teeth every 20 
minutes. And every time I inhaled a cigarette, I felt guilty about endangering 
my health. 
</P>
<P>
But I never felt guilty chewing (actually you don't chew, you park it on your 
gums); instead I enjoyed a mild nicotine rush and the keen sense of moral 
superiority and relief that goes with becoming a nonsmoker. I was very grateful 
the gum was there for me. 
</P>
<P>
And it would still be there for me if Moe, my pharmacist, hadn't opened his big 
mouth. "You've got to stop chewing this," he exclaimed when I went to pick up 
my weekly supply. "It's pretty obvious when someone's hooked," he chided, 
adding that most people manage to give up the gum in a few months. I stammered 
something about not really being a gum junkie. But Moe wouldn't let it drop. 
"You don't go around shaking and dribbling at the mouth," he said. "And you're 
not selling your body on the street. Still, it's not that difficult to spot a 
problem." How? "Forty-eight refills is a clue," he said with a superior smile. 
</P>
<P>
"I can stop whenever I want," I said defensively. But why would I want to stop? 
I loved my wonderful gum. With cigarettes I faced public humiliation and social 
ostracism. But not with Miss Nicky. There were no "Chewing" and "No Chewing" 
sections in restaurants and airplanes. Strangers didn't lecture me on the 
dangers of second-hand gum fumes. I wasn't ordered outside in the middle of a 
dinner party if I wanted a chew. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly anyone knew I was chewing. And who cared? There were no ashes, no 
overflowing ashtrays, no foul odor clinging to my breath, clothes and hair. 
There was no danger of starting a fire with gum. I wasn't going to accidentally 
burn down a forest or a bed, or even singe a sofa. Once in a while, a piece 
might get stuck to a sofa cushion, but a little ice would take it off. 
</P>
<P>
It was no big deal, except to Moe. If it hadn't been for him, I wouldn't have 
casually suggested to my husband, "Hey, honey. Let's drive to Tijuana." Duke 
looked at me with alarm. I loathe Tijuana, but it's the only place on the 
planet I know where they have flyers for the farmacia ("We have Retin-A!") in 
the government tourist office. And in Mexico they sell Nicorette over the 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
"Have the doctor call the prescription in to another pharmacy," Duke said. I 
considered it, but I knew I'd still imagine Moe's accusing voice saying, 
"Gumhead, gumhead!" 
</P>
<P>
So there I was, crazed, frantically rummaging through the wastebasket, hunting 
for scraps of Nicorette; gnawing four packs of Chiclets a day. Chiclets 
wouldn't do. Finally, I hit on the solution: Kill Moe. 
</P>
<P>
It would be really easy. 
</P>
<P>
He and my husband are longtime acquaintances, and we often run into each other 
at social gatherings. In fact, we expected to see him that night at a benefit 
on the Santa Monica Pier. I'd lure him over to the end of the wharf, on the 
premise of discussing my addiction. And then a quick shove would do the rest. 
</P>
<P>
But Moe didn't come. I didn't see him for three weeks. And by then, I was 
already over the worst withdrawal symptoms. It wasn't just physical, oh no -- 
that discomfort lasted only a few days. What really rankled was the utter lack 
of social cachet involved in my noble sacrifice. When I told my friends that I 
was quitting smoking, I got compassion, I got admiration, I got useful tips. 
But when I said that I was giving up Nicorette, eyes glazed, subjects changed, 
people remembered urgent previous engagements. 
</P>
<P>
Later, I called an expert to find out what diseases I'd managed to avoid. 
"There's no disease caused by Nicorette gum," said Nina Schneider, associate 
research psychologist at UCLA and the first American to study Nicorette. 
"There's no evidence that it's unsafe. Even if you're on gum for five years, 
you're not going to get emphysema, lung cancer or even heart disease."

Still, I guess I'm glad I quit. Duke's proud of me. And so is Moe. Recently, I 
confessed I'd planned his murder. "Nobody's ever told me that," he said. "It's 
a pharmaceutical first." I was about to tell him I appreciated his concern. But 
Moe said, "You know, I would have given you another box. I'm not stupid. You 
may have been addicted to the nicotine, but at least you weren't smoking." 
</P>
<P>
I think I'm going to kill Moe.

THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF AMERICAN CHRISTIANITY BY NATHAN O. HATCH (YALE 
UNIVERSITY PRESS: $25; 312 PP.; 0-300-4470-4) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert S. Michaelson, Michaelson, professor of religious studies, emeritus, 
University of California, Santa Barbara, is the author of The American Search 
for Soul and co-editor of Liberal Protestantism: Realities and Possibilities. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
St. Paul, an astute observer of things religious, pointed out to the skeptical 
Athenians that they were "in every way . . . a very religious people." 
Professors Jon Butler and Nathan O. Hatch, impressively astute in their studies 
of religion in America, offer fresh insights and substantial documentation 
regarding the pervasive religiosity of the American people. While they 
concentrate on earlier periods in American history and deal primarily with 
Protestant Christianity, they do shed new light on the overall picture and on 
the American religious scene today. 
</P>
<P>
As with the religious beliefs and practices of the Athenians, those of the 
American people are, as these studies substantiate, bewilderingly complex. As 
something of a foil in his story of the complex process of the Christianization 
of Americans, Butler includes informative treatments of magic, the occult and 
similar "heterodox" phenomena. Hatch focuses much of his attention on different 
individuals such as Francis Asbury, the pioneering Methodist bishop; Joseph 
Smith, the Mormon prophet; Richard Allen, the founder of the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, and Alexander Campbell, leading figure in the shaping of the 
Christian or Disciples of Christ movement. 
</P>
<P>
Fresh insights? Hatch devotes attention to such significant phenomena as the 
development of American gospel music, an important story that is generally 
slighted among scholars. And Butler attends to "the religious landscape" -- the 
changing architectural manifestations of religion in America -- another area 
largely overlooked in studies of religion in America. 
</P>
<P>
What is most refreshing about these works, then, is that they eschew the more 
typical way of dealing with religion in America in terms of elites and 
organizations, and concentrate instead on the religious beliefs and practices 
of the people. Theirs is a story of the laicization of religion, religion in 
and as populist movements, religion sprung from the American soil and soul. 
</P>
<P>
Hence, Butler, e.g., takes on the generally accepted view of the primacy of the 
Puritans and the dominating influence of the "so-called Great Awakening" of the 
1740s in the larger story of religion in America. Similarly, Hatch sees the 
Second Great Awakening, the usual designation for an outburst of Evangelical 
revivals in the early years of the new republic, as being more divisive than 
unifying, more identified with what Alexis de Tocqueville, French observer of 
American democracy in the early 1830s, called the "seething mobility" of people 
and ideas than with any singleness of purpose or character. These American 
migrants -- "adventurers," Tocqueville called them -- were "impatient of any 
yoke, greedy for wealth, and often outcasts . . . . There is nothing of 
tradition, family feeling or example to restrain them." 
</P>
<P>
The most common religious feature among these emerging Americans was their 
desire to begin anew, to build their own religion or to find that religion 
which, stripped of nonessentials, consisted of nothing more or less than the 
straight line to the supernatural and to salvation. 
</P>
<P>
That route typically involved not only thinking for oneself but experiencing of 
oneself. And above all, it required relying on and interpreting for oneself 
that rock-bottom source, the Bible. "I have endeavored to read the Scriptures 
as though no one had read them before me," asserted Alexander Campbell. (A 
common claim of those active in the Christian movement of the early 19th 
Century was: "Where the New Testament speaks, we speak; where the New Testament 
is silent, we are silent.") 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, this reliance on self produced not only the rich variety of 
expressions that one might expect but also some highly disciplined and even 
centralized and authoritarian movements. 
</P>
<P>
Butler stresses "the role of authority and coercion in advancing Christianity 
in America." Hatch points out that while his book is "about popular religion 
(it) focuses, ironically, upon elites" -- i.e., "upon those persons who rose to 
leadership positions in a wide range of popular American churches and religious 
movements." 
</P>
<P>
These leaders were not of the elite in a class or social sense; they were of 
the people. Individuals of considerable native abilities who were remarkably 
attuned to popular sentiment, they had the capacity to mobilize that sentiment 
into powerful popular movements that became lasting organizations: Baptist, 
Methodist, Christian, African Methodist, Mormon and others. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville noted in amazement of such American religious leaders that "where I 
expect to find a priest I find a politician." These were not "organization men" 
in a narrow sense. They understood their parish, as John Wesley understood his, 
to include the whole world. Religion was for them a public as well as a private 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
The popular Baptist leader, John Leland, after a prominent public career in 
support of religious liberty and in opposition to slavery in Virginia, returned 
in 1791 to New England, where he served two terms in the Massachusetts 
Legislature. A generation later, Peter Cartwright, famed Methodist 
circuit-rider, served two terms in the Illinois Legislature and, in 1846, ran 
for U.S. Congress. (He was defeated by none other than Abraham Lincoln.) In 
1844, Joseph Smith sought to become President of the United States. (He was 
martyred before the election.) 
</P>
<P>
Political ambition and activity is not a new phenomenon among American 
religious leaders. Indeed, there are echoes of these early Evangelical types 
among the popular preachers, the televangelists, and the clerical candidates 
for public office in our time. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly the most significant aspect of the rise of Christianity as a popular 
movement was the emergence of Afro-American Christianity. Butler traces the 
roots of this striking phenomenon to what he calls "the African spiritual 
holocaust," brought on by the brutal uprooting that characterized the slave 
system. Into the resulting spiritual vacuum poured the balm purveyed by the 
most popular of the Christian movements following the American Revolution -- 
the Methodist and the Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
Both were, in that period, strongly anti-slavery, and both freely approached 
blacks, as they did whites, with their popular message and the means for 
conveying that message. However, as Butler points out, these movements 
exhibited "a fundamental paradox within Evangelical Protestantism: its 
egalitarian character and its racism." 
</P>
<P>
Hence, while blacks were attracted to the Evangelical message, they rejected 
the organizational medium and, where possible, established their own. The 
result was an emerging Afro-American Christianity similar to white American 
Evangelical Christianity and yet clearly distinctive. Within the Afro-American 
community, the church became the most significant institution and the preacher 
the most powerful figure. As W. E. B. DuBois observed in his description of 
black religion at the end of the 19th Century, the preacher was "the most 
unique personality developed by the Negro on American soil. A leader, a 
politician, an orator, a 'boss,' an intriguer, an idealist -- all these he is, 
and ever too, the center of a group of men, now twenty, now a thousand in 
number." 
</P>
<P>
These volumes might be faulted for the fact that there is little about women in 
them and even less about Roman Catholicism. Relying on the 1833 memoirs of 
Nancy Towle, a young New Hampshire schoolteacher who became "a relentless 
preacher on the move," Hatch notes that women preachers appeared among 
Christians, Freewill Baptists, Universalists and Methodists. Women were not 
allowed leadership roles in the denominations that emerged from these 
movements. Yet women later capitalized on the impulses and techniques that 
emerged in the popular religious movement of the early republic. 
</P>
<P>
Something would appear to be missing in volumes that carry titles such as these 
do but largely ignore the Roman Catholic community. There were democratizing 
trends within that community in the early 19th Century. And by 1865, the 
terminal date of Butler's volume, the Roman Catholic Church had become the 
largest single Christian denomination in America. 
</P>
<P>
This oversight may be explained by the authors' focus on laicization and 
popularization. Despite the fact that lay people did play an increasing role in 
local church affairs, no shortcut to the ordained priesthood opened within 
Roman Catholicism. That office remained under the control of the bishop and 
continued to require systematic training over a relatively long period of time. 
As a result, there was a scarcity of priests and many were recruited from 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these lacunae, these volumes are timely and valuable. They provide 
salutary reminders that the story of religion in America is not one of decline 
and stagnation but one of ferment and fertility.

MISGUIDED MISSILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I must protest your printing of the social-activist diatribe posing as literary 
criticism that Alejandro Morales spewed out against "The Wedding," by Mary 
Helen Ponce (Book Review, Nov. 19). Aside from wasting valuable space, it was 
cruel and irresponsible of you to allow this ethnic paranoiac to savage the 
efforts of a first-time novelist in such a shallow, biased and self-serving 
fashion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I believe that Ms. Ponce is aware of the technique of effectively ridiculing 
negative stereotypes by simply presenting an accurate picture of them. 
</P>
<P>
It removes their glamour and acceptability, something that is long overdue for 
the "alternative cultural expression" that is gang membership. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It requires a good deal of self-respect for someone to take an honest look at 
themselves, good parts and bad, whether an individual or a people. A common 
form of self-hatred carries as its shield the demand that only good be 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Morales proves the benefit of ridiculing negative stereotypes by doing an 
excellent job on himself. His review prompted me to order the book. Ten copies. 
Perhaps he can next turn his venom on Salmon Rushdie.

A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whenever people ask me about the situation in Nicaragua, I tell them it's a 
civil war. Now Art Seidenbaum has reviewed a book that points out how and why 
it is a civil war ("Memoirs of a Counter-Revolutionary" by Arturo Cruz Jr., 
Book Review, Nov. 19). 
</P>
<P>
Families are so interrelated that when I lived in Nicaragua, we used to joke 
that one should never make disparaging remarks about anybody, because there was 
bound to be a relative of that person sitting next to you. 
</P>
<P>
If the South, more than 100 years after our Civil War, is still hoping to "rise 
again," it should be obvious to our government that it is futile to expect the 
U.S. to ever resolve the differences in Nicaragua by intervening in their civil 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks for an excellent review.

WRONG END OF THE BINOCULARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re the review of "The Year Of the Zinc Penny" by Rick DeMarinis (Book Review, 
Nov. 19), the author writes: "Test pilots from all the major plants put their 
planes through the paces straight over our heads . . . low-level skipping 
imaginary bombs through the hot streets. Huge (sic) formations of B-25 
Mitchells shock the buildings . . . high-flying B-24s left vapor trails as they 
crossed from west to east on their way to England." 
</P>
<P>
I was based at Long Beach airport during the period referred to, at 
headquarters for the 6th Ferry Command, crewing bombers to the South Pacific, 
South and North Atlantic routes to Europe. Perhaps I was away from base during 
all of these described flights. I do not think so. The B-24s were built and 
flown out of Consolidated in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
I do not disagree with the concept and theme of the book, but it loses 
credibility with scenes described as above, if I am to believe they were also 
observed with the "tin binoculars" from the cereal boxes. 
</P>
<P>
If my conclusions are in error I am willing to accept a clarification proving 
me in error.

Readers may find it difficult to believe that the subject of this arresting 
autobiography survived his unhappy childhood to become a highly respected 
writer rather than a convict on death row. His efforts to escape from his 
abusive stepfather and ineffectual mother lead Tobias Wolff to lie, cheat, 
steal, drink, run away and forge checks. 
</P>
<P>
He changes his from name "Tobias," an old name in his father's family, to 
"Jack" in a gesture of rejection, but he lies and falsifies transcripts to gain 
admission to the exclusive prep school his father and brother attended. The 
author spares neither his audience nor himself: He was clearly an incorrigible 
thug as a youth, but his pain is so overwhelming that the reader longs to 
comfort him rather than discipline him. Wolff's vigorous, straightforward prose 
makes "This Boy's Life" a darkly memorable book.

Eight brief, pleasantly convoluted mysteries that resemble Sherlock Holmes 
stories without Sherlock. Doyle titilates the reader with seemingly unsolvable 
conundrums, but Baker Street Irregulars can easily imagine the master detective 
uncovering the dark secret of the Man With the Watches, detecting the paste 
stones substituted for the priceless gems in the ancient Breastplate of the 
Jewish High Priest or rescuing a ne'er-do-well young heir from the claws of the 
Brazilian Cat. In the introduction, Doyle stated that he would like these 
stories to be "read 'round the fire' upon a winter's night," a suggestion that 
offers a family or group of friends a cozy respite from television.

<P>
Although his sprawling "Stranger in a Strange Land" became one of the icons of 
the '60s counterculture, Robert Heinlein did his best writing in the juvenile 
novels he produced during the late '40s and early '50s. Crisply paced, neatly 
plotted and peopled with agreeable characters, "Red Planet" (also "Tunnel in 
the Sky," "Starman Jones," "Farmer in the Sky" and "Time for the Stars") still 
can entertain readers, while such "adult" works as "Glory Road" and "Farnham's 
Freehold" have been consigned to the shelves reserved for pretentious bores. 
</P>
<P>
A pronounced conservatism runs through Heinlein's work, and he manages to 
transplant old-fashioned Midwestern values to other planets and centuries. Near 
the end of "Red Planet," at a town meeting on Mars, the colorful, wise Doc 
declares, "Any man old enough to fight is a man and must be treated as such -- 
and any girl old enough to cook and tend babies is an adult, too."

REMODELED MANHATTAN BEACH HOME TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THE MATCHLESS VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
HOW DO YOU transform a warren of dark rooms into a light and airy house for an 
expanding family? That was the challenge facing Culver City-based architect 
Melinda Gray Payne when she began to remodel an oceanfront home on The Strand 
in Manhattan Beach. The house -- actually a three-story building plus an 
apartment over the garage in back -- had a matchless view, but it had been 
poorly planned and divided in two by its previous owners. Payne's task was to 
create a few spacious living areas and seven bedrooms for her client, a venture 
capitalist with three small children and live-in help. "I want to know I'm at 
the beach," the owner told her, "and I need to keep track of my family." So in 
her renovation, Payne grouped the rooms coherently -- and allowed each to share 
the view. 
</P>
<P>
Payne began by stripping the exterior of its fake Spanish trim and removing the 
tiled roof. That allowed her to raise the ceilings in the upper-story rooms 
without changing the restricted height of the building. Then she remodeled the 
facade, setting big oceanfront windows back behind the structural frame to 
shield them from direct sunlight. That formed deeply recessed balconies, which 
Payne enclosed with glass parapets to shelter them from coastal breezes. 
</P>
<P>
To open up the rest of the house, Payne gutted the interior to fashion a 
6,000-square-foot living space, which she pierced with two wells of light. The 
circular core of the house embraces the entrance hall and a courtyard that 
contains a pool and hot tub. The core is echoed in a circular light well that 
rises from the living room through the master bedroom suite above. The two 
cylinders suffuse every corner with light, contribute to the cross ventilation 
that keeps the house cool and allow almost every room a glimpse of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The children's bedrooms are separated from the master suite by both the 
courtyard and a family room and are designed to delight the youngest members of 
the household. The children's bathtub is in a lofty circular room tiled in 
their favorite colors, and a hatch and slide link the rooms of the two older 
children. 
</P>
<P>
The master suite is a free-flowing space, with bed, bathroom, dressing room and 
balcony occupying the four corners of a tiny interior courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
This previously awkward house now has a pleasing sense of intimacy inside and 
out, making this remodel an inspiration for the design of smaller structures as 
well. Michael Webb

Fabrics with satin, leather, suede, velvet, brocade, metallic, iridescent and 
multi-crossprint surfaces would seem to defy conventional wisdom about what's 
suitable for the sport. But these, too, are great pretenders with high-tech 
roots. The major technical breakthrough this year is a Japanese fabric called 
Solar Alpha, which absorbs solar energy and converts it to thermal energy. It's 
the first active heat source ever to be built into ski wear, and this year it's 
being used in Bogner clothing and the men's Kaelin Tech collection. 
</P>
<P>
Bogner, the perpetual quality classic of ski-wear design, offers one of the 
most exotic looks on the slopes with its Topkapi collection, a rich melange of 
embossed florals, satin prints, opulent embroideries and a "1001" tapestry with 
16 colors. The silhouette is evocative of the harem with loose pants and 
turbanned headgear. Asian opulence crops up again in Stefan Kaelin's Skiing 
Finesse line, a gorgeous mixture of richly textured fabrics, jewel-tone 
Jacquards, silvered satins and splash-print nylons with fuchsias and reds, 
marine blues and emerald greens set off by a range of neutrals. 
</P>
<P>
For women, the new cinch-waist pant, high-waisted, belted stretch pant, and 
fuller bodices play up the curves of well-toned bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, there is a trend toward mix-and-match pieces -- ski vests, jackets, 
warm-up pants, stretch pants, ski blouses -- that can be layered to suit ski 
and weather conditions and to create different looks. That means matching sets 
of suits, socks, mittens, headbands, scarfs and T-necks are out this year, 
along with ski sweaters. This season's ubiquitous neons are being replaced, at 
least on the slopes in Europe, with a muted palette of maroon, brown, olive, 
navy and black.

HEALTH: CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT TO DO WHEN DOCTORS' ADVICE AND PRESCRIPTIONS ARE HARD TO SWALLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL S. WILKES and MIRIAM SHUCHMAN, Michael S. Wilkes is a physician in 
the Clinical Scholars Program at the UCLA Medical Center. Miriam Shuchman 
teaches psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School. Their column appears monthly.

A SANTA MONICA pediatrician became frustrated when a 9-year-old boy was brought 
to her office for the third time in less than a month. The boy, who had severe 
breathing problems, was supposed to be taking a powerful anti-asthma medicine 
that was critical for his health. But it was obvious that he had not, and his 
symptoms had steadily worsened. Now, concerned that the boy's mother did not 
understand the seriousness of the illness, the doctor sat her down, yet again, 
to explain the dangers of asthma. And the mother, who was equally frustrated, 
insisted that she had tried to give her son the pills, but the medicine upset 
his stomach and he refused to take it. 
</P>
<P>
Like the child's mother, many people do not follow doctors' orders, often for 
good reasons. Studies show, for example, that at least a third of patients fail 
to take medicines as instructed. They stop the prescription before it is 
completed, take the wrong dose, or forgo the medicine altogether. According to 
one study, people with strep throat who are given a seven-day course of 
antibiotics commonly stop taking the medicine by the third day. Another study 
found that only two-thirds of patients being treated for high blood pressure 
actually take enough medicine to control it. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors refer to patients who follow a medical regimen as "compliant." Those 
who fail to do as they are told are labeled "noncompliant." The labeling 
implies that a person who does not take medication as ordered is behaving in a 
deviant way. But in fact, about half of all people being treated for such 
chronic medical conditions as high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis and 
depression fall into the noncompliant category. Noncompliance, according to one 
group of researchers writing in the Annals of Internal Medicine, may be the 
most significant problem facing doctors today. 
</P>
<P>
But the notion that a patient always ought to do as told suggests that the 
physician alone knows what is best and the patient knows nothing. That, of 
course, is false. People have a variety of reasons for not taking medicines as 
prescribed. Studies show that an individual's social class and level of 
education have no bearing on whether that person takes a medicine, but the 
medicine itself does make a difference. People are less apt to take a medicine 
if there are troublesome side effects, if it has to be taken for a prolonged 
period, or if there are complex instructions for taking it. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, the high cost of drugs is the overriding factor. A 70-year-old 
woman with a skin infection who received a prescription for antibiotics 
recently was shocked to learn that the drug would cost $58. She simply could 
not afford the drug, so she had no choice but to treat her infection with home 
remedies. Had her doctor understood her financial constraints, he could have 
prescribed an equally effective drug at half the cost. But most doctors do not 
consider the price of a drug when prescribing. In fact, most do not even know 
the prices of drugs. Consumers learn the prices when they go to pay for them, 
because insurance plans often do not cover prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the failure to follow medical advice can be extremely dangerous. In 
the case of the boy with asthma, his recurrent breathing problems could have 
fatal consequences. The physician knew that, and focused her efforts on 
repeating the instructions for the medicine ever more carefully and slowly. But 
this was little help to a mother who needed to know what to do when her child 
became nauseated. Should she lower the dose? Was there a different form of the 
medication that might not have that side effect? Was she giving the medicine 
too close to mealtime? 
</P>
<P>
When patients do not ask specific questions, doctors may fail to address the 
problems of medications. Hospitals require that doctors recommending a surgical 
procedure list all the possible adverse consequences of the surgery, and 
patients are even asked to sign a form saying that they understand the reasons 
for the surgery and the possible risks. But there are no such built-in 
mechanisms for explaining the benefits and risks of prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
Because the misunderstandings about medicines are so common, anyone receiving a 
new prescription should ask the doctor a few key questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why is this medicine important? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What will happen if I don't take it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What side effects should I expect? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Is there an alternative medicine that is cheaper or causes fewer side 
effects? 
</P>
<P>
Even when all the questions have been answered, it is difficult to take 
medicines on a regular basis. Realizing this, medical technology and 
pharmaceutical firms have developed a variety of shortcuts -- ways to ensure 
that people receive the maximum benefit of a medicine for a minimum of effort. 
For example, women with uncomplicated bladder infections who would have been 
prescribed a 10-day course of antibiotics just a few years ago may now be 
treated in the office with a single super-strong dose of medication. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, people with certain venereal diseases may be treated with a one-time 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
Despite these, people with chronic illnesses may simply decide on their own 
when to take a medicine, regardless of their doctors' advice. Medical 
sociologist Peter Conrad and his colleagues at Brandeis University in Boston 
interviewed people with epilepsy who are obliged to take medication daily to 
control seizures. More than 40% of those interviewed said they frequently 
modified their prescription without consulting a doctor, generally by stopping 
the medicine for a period of time or lowering the dose. 
</P>
<P>
They especially did this when the medication seemed to be ineffective, or when 
the side effects became too disturbing. The researchers suggested that doctors 
stop asking why people don't "comply" with their orders and instead start 
trying to understand the need for individuals with a chronic illness to assert 
some personal control over that illness through their medications.

I am shocked to read that professionals who deal with children believe that 
"children don't lie." 
</P>
<P>
Where on earth are their real-life experiences with children? And don't they 
know of Lawrence Kohlberg's famous study at Harvard that shows that children 
don't develop a moral code until they are 7 or 8? 
</P>
<P>
Hasn't anyone considered the possibility that the children were playing doctor 
and that the little girl, rather than saying, "We were playing doctor and I 
enjoyed it," projected onto the little boy's father the injury? 
</P>
<P>
I admire the Johnsons for insisting that their story be told.

It is interesting that much is made of the Johnsons' class status. Would this 
story have been done if Mr. Johnson had been a welder instead of a 
"professional"? A Mexican-American immigrant gardener? The fact that the 
Johnsons own a home with a view where they have lovely barbecues for their 
friends only serves to call attention to what is true in many dysfunctional 
families (and which seemed very important to Siegel): Appearance is everything. 
Although I feel certain that Siegel knows that sexual abuse of children knows 
no class or economic boundary, the maintenance of Mr. Johnson's innocence seems 
to hinge largely on his professional status and his good income (and his own 
businessman-style aggressiveness).

QUIZ-SHOW SCANDAL

<P>
For years I have cussed at Howard Rosenberg's cussedness and smart-alecky 
remarks in his TV columns, but "How Did the '50s Quiz-Show Scandal Ensnare a 
Tennessee Minister?" (Nov. 5) made me realize Rosenberg can be a great writer. 
I think he, or the remarkable Stoney Jackson, summed up television's role in 
modern society with: The quiz-show scandals "produced a moral lassitude in 
America, and I think we are still feeling the results of the betrayal."

Maybe we jump to conclusions too quickly without carefully thinking about the 
possible damage to the accused, if innocent. 
</P>
<P>
But our intentions are to save the children and catch the guilty. It would not 
be easy to take the standpoint I am taking now if it were my child that was 
molested. I feel sorry for the accused, also for the parents of the child, and 
for the child, who will be damaged for the rest of her life. And I am hateful 
for the guilty who are still out there hurting more and more innocent victims.

'NO DEAL' ON NORIEGA, BUSH SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
JUSTICE: THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S NOT SEEKING A PLEA BARGAIN FOR THE FORMER 
PANAMANIAN LEADER. HE VOWED TO 'BEND OVER BACKWARD' TO ENSURE A FAIR TRIAL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush said Friday he is "not seeking a deal" on a reduced charge for 
Manuel A. Noriega and vowed to "bend over backward" to avoid saying anything 
that would interfere with the deposed Panamanian ruler's trial. 
</P>
<P>
"Our case is strong, our resolve is firm and our legal representations are 
sound," Bush told a nationally televised news conference after discussing 
Noriega's prosecution on drug-trafficking charges with Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also announced he is dispatching Vice President Dan Quayle on a 
fence-mending tour of Latin America "within the next several days" to explain 
the U.S. military action and muster support for the new Panamanian government 
of President Guillermo Endara. 
</P>
<P>
Conceding the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion of Panama had upset U.S. allies in Central 
and South America, the President said: "I am concerned, because I am well aware 
of how our friends south of our border . . . look at the use of American force 
anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "I think it's something that's correctable." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he has "no immediate plans" to visit Panama. However, an 
Administration official, who declined to be identified, said that a 
presidential visit is under consideration and that Panama might also be 
included on Quayle's itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
The President called Panama's economy "a major priority" to help it recover 
from the U.S. military invasion and economic sanctions. He did not put a price 
tag on the U.S. aid, but some estimates for the damage have run as high as $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he savored Noriega's capture, Bush said he would be "ever mindful" of 
the legal process from now on, suggesting he would refrain from his previous 
characterizations of Noriega as a "thug" and a criminal. 
</P>
<P>
"He is now in custody. Time for rhetoric is over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he is convinced that Noriega will get a fair trial. "I am going to 
bend over backward and not answer hypothetical questions or not do anything 
that might prejudice that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With Noriega securely in U.S. custody in Florida, Bush said he hopes to bring 
U.S. combat troops home from Panama "as soon as possible." But he refused to 
give a timetable. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he ruled out a long-term peacekeeping role for U.S. troops. "I'd like to 
see their police forces, whatever emerges, reconstituted," Bush said. Noriega's 
Panamanian Defense Forces were routed in the U.S. military action. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the 12,000 troops stationed at U.S. bases in Panama before the 
invasion will be left there, but will not serve a police role. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,900 combat troops were brought home last week, leaving about 24,500 
military personnel, according to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
In an opening statement at his news conference, Bush said: "Our government is 
not seeking a deal with Noriega. Our policy remains that we have brought him to 
this country for prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to a fair trial and to providing all the protections 
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws," Bush 
</P>
<P>
added. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would rule out a plea bargain with Noriega -- perhaps offering 
reduced charges in exchange for Noriega's information on drug-trafficking -- 
Bush said: "I'm not ruling it in." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I'm just saying he's got his rights and . . . we ought not to stand 
up here and try to define narrowly what they are." 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Noriega attorney Steven Kollin said Noriega is not interested in a 
plea bargain. "A man who is innocent is not receptive to any plea bargain. 
General Noriega is not guilty of any of these charges." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega refused to answer the charges against him at a brief arraignment last 
week, and the federal judge in his case entered a not-guilty plea on his 
behalf. The general remained in custody at an undisclosed location Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Bush dismissed as "ridiculous" a question on whether the invasion of Panama and 
surrender of Noriega had become a "political jackpot" for him. 
</P>
<P>
"A President's called on to take certain actions. We're not going in to try to 
furbish a political image," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Bush was asked if the action would silence Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell's criticism that Bush had a timid foreign policy. "Knowing 
George, he'll find a way. And that's his job. Look, we're going into an 
election year." 
</P>
<P>
An aide to the Maine Democrat, Diane Dewhirst, said: "Sen. Mitchell has 
consistently said that when he agrees with Bush on foreign policy he will be 
vigorously supportive and that when he disagrees he will offer constructive 
alternatives. That has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
Bush took the unusual step of ending his news conference with a complaint to 
television networks about coverage of his last news conference, on Dec. 21. He 
protested that some networks juxtaposed his lighthearted banter with reporters 
with pictures of bodies of U.S. servicemen killed in Panama being unloaded from 
a transport plane. 
</P>
<P>
"I could understand why the viewers were concerned about this," Bush said. 
"They thought that their President at a solemn moment like that didn't give a 
damn." 
</P>
<P>
His voice choking, Bush said: "And I do, I do; I feel it so strongly." 
</P>
<P>
In other comments, the President: 
</P>
<P>
* Said he did not envision a change in U.S. policy against intentionally 
sending military women into combat, although he would weigh such a 
recommendation if presented to him by the Pentagon. He praised the "heroic 
performance" of a "highly trained, gung-ho" group of women who did engage in 
combat in the Panama action. 
</P>
<P>
* Deplored the death of an American nun in Nicaragua, but refused to fix blame 
on the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. He noted that the Contras had denied a role, 
but he added: "It is extraordinarily murky." 
</P>
<P>
* Defended anew two secret missions to China by National Security Adviser Brent 
Scowcroft, saying "there has been progress" toward reform as a result of the 
visits.

ASBESTOS DISEASE STILL RISES DUE TO LAG BETWEEN EXPOSURE AND ILLNESS; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: THOUSANDS OF WORKERS FACE THE EFFECTS OF THE 'MIRACLE FIBER' DESPITE 18 
YEARS OF REGULATION. THE NUMBER OF PLAINTIFFS SUING COMPANIES RISES DAILY.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kevin Quinn's father began working for Consolidated Edison in the 1940s, when 
asbestos was still considered a miracle fiber and no regulations governed its 
use. 
</P>
<P>
William Quinn died in 1980 of cancer linked to asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
His son was hired by the same utility in 1979. In the years since his father 
first came in contact with asbestos, numerous laws were passed to protect 
workers from what had become acknowledged as a prime health risk. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1987, Quinn said, he was working at a plant when asbestos-covered doors 
were removed from boilers and dropped to the floor. The doors remained for 
weeks while workers went about their duties without protective gear amid clouds 
of asbestos dust, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to walk past that area every day," he said. "They told us it was safe. 
And it turns out it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Quinn has joined 180 co-workers and the Environmental Protection Agency in 
suing Con Ed, charging that he was exposed to the same material that killed his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen years after passage of the first federal law regulating asbestos, 
thousands of workers -- at utilities like Con Ed, and in other industries where 
asbestos was used as an insulator -- still face its effects. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking to people who are extremely surprised that asbestos is still a 
problem," said Heather Maurer, executive director of Asbestos Victims of 
America. "But the incidence of asbestos disease is on the increase instead of 
the decrease, despite restrictions that have been applied to make the use of 
asbestos safer." 
</P>
<P>
A recent union-sponsored screening of 538 Con Edison workers found that 20% had 
either scarred lungs or mesothelioma, an asbestos-caused cancer of the lining 
of the abdomen or the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, Con Ed has been cited by the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration for more than half a dozen alleged violations -- mostly failure 
to monitor the level of asbestos fibers in the air -- at the Indian Point 
nuclear plant in Buchanan; at a plant in Astoria, Queens, and at Quinn's 74th 
Street plant in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Some allegations are still under investigation, some have been contested and 
dropped by OSHA, and Con Ed settled others by paying a fine. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to 1973, we didn't know what the asbestos risks were," said Con Ed 
spokeswoman Rosalie Zuckerman. "We're not denying that prior to that time, 
there was exposure. But now that we're aware of it, whenever we do any asbestos 
work, we follow all the regulations." 
</P>
<P>
She added that since 1973, the company has had two medical vans visiting Con Ed 
plants, carrying X-ray machines to test for asbestos scarring. 
</P>
<P>
She would not comment on Kevin Quinn's suit. But Quinn said the company was 
negligent in 1987, when he was exposed. The workers, he said, were kept in the 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't realize we were working around asbestos till a shop steward took an 
air sample to the White Lung Assn.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because asbestos cancers can take 20 to 35 years to develop, workers like Quinn 
who believe they have been exposed recently may not become sick until the year 
2020. People who were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s, '60s and '70s are just 
now getting sick. 
</P>
<P>
A study by Dr. Irving Selikoff, perhaps the world's most noted asbestos 
researcher, and his colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine projects 
that asbestos cancer rates won't peak until 1992 and won't drop off 
significantly until after the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Smoking exacerbates the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer, which is 
incurable in 70% to 95% of cases, said Dr. Stephen Levin, who works with 
Selikoff. Mesothelioma is always fatal. Asbestos exposure also increases the 
risk of colon cancer, which has an 80% cure rate if caught early. 
</P>
<P>
The study predicts that 9,739 deaths from asbestos exposure will be recorded in 
1992 in just 11 industries, including utilities, construction, car and railroad 
engine repair, shipbuilding and asbestos manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
Many Con Ed workers fear that they might surface among those statistics: 
</P>
<P>
* Gene Duffy, 46, has worked for Con Edison for 25 years. His chest X-rays show 
lung scarring; he often has trouble breathing. Duffy said he can't even cut his 
lawn without taking a rest halfway through to catch his breath. 
</P>
<P>
* Artie Sagevick, 58, a 31-year veteran. He gave up smoking 25 years ago but he 
has "coughing fits 15 minutes at a time a couple of times a day."

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Asbestos had been suspected of causing lung diseases since about the turn of 
the century, but it wasn't until 1973 that federal laws began to regulate 
exposure. Inhalation of asbestos fibers triggers the diseases, which may lay 
dormant for 20 years or more. Asbestos has been widely used as insulation, and 
as the material ages it becomes friable, which means that its fibers crumble 
and can be released into the air. The Environmental Protection Agency requires 
asbestos' removal from older buildings, especially schools.

DESPITE RADICALS' GRUMBLINGS, IRAN INTENSIFIES BIRTH-CONTROL PROGRAM; 
</P>
<P>
POPULATION: WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST BIRTH RATES IN THE WORLD, FEARS GROW THAT 
THE COUNTRY COULD FACE A MAJOR SOCIAL EXPLOSION.

<P>
Iran's government is intensifying a birth-control program -- despite opposition 
from radicals -- because the country's fast-growing population is imposing 
strains on a struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
"If the Islamic Republic's government does not implement proper and swift plans 
for controlling population growth in Iran, future generations will definitely 
face severe social and economic problems," Tehran's Kayhan International 
newspaper warned recently. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we be proud of a nation of hungry Muslims who have to beg the infidels of 
the world for charity?" declared Mohammed Yazdi, a member of the 12-member 
Council of Guardians, a legislative watchdog body. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has one of the highest birth rates in the world, between 3.5% and 4% a 
year. Even in the Middle East, where soaring populations are the norm, Iran's 
baby boom is fast outstripping development. 
</P>
<P>
Before the 1979 Islamic revolution, Iran had about 35 million people. Last 
month, the government's chief statistician, Majid Shamshidi, said the 
population had reached 55 million. 
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that by the year 2010, Iran will have 140 million people. They 
warn that unless something is done soon to curb the birth rate and rapidly 
expand the economy, the country faces a major social explosion. 
</P>
<P>
While Iran struggles to cope with its baby boom, rival Iraq is striving to 
expand its population to keep up with the Iranians should the Iran-Iraq War, 
halted by an August, 1988, cease-fire, flare up again. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq has about 16 million people, and President Saddam Hussein has declared 
that increasing its birth rate a "strategic duty." He offers hefty financial 
incentives, including cash grants and interest-free home-purchase loans. 
</P>
<P>
Iran launched a half-hearted birth-control campaign last year, with some 
religious leaders encouraging Iran's predominantly Muslim population to have 
fewer children. Now Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has 
declared that birth control is not un-Islamic, although abortion is illegal. 
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry announced it has set up centers in major cities to provide 
free contraceptives. But the contraceptives reportedly are in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers say that unless more is done to get the message across, the 
government program will have little impact on Iranians, who have traditionally 
favored large families. 
</P>
<P>
The English-language Tehran Times called in December for a media campaign to 
warn Iranians of the danger of unrestrained population growth "to bring this 
immense problem . . . under control." 
</P>
<P>
Kayhan International declared: "This phenomenon should be seriously and 
properly dealt with. Using economic incentives, the government should encourage 
Iranian couples to have only two children." 
</P>
<P>
One of President Hashemi Rafsanjani's most important priorities is expanding 
the economy to at least five times its current size to accommodate the expected 
population growth. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Western economists believe the economy, plagued by bad management 
during the revolution and the 8-year war with Iraq, is already severely 
stretched and needs massive investment just to cope with the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's rivals oppose birth control. They believe that the larger Iran's 
population, the greater its chances of becoming the undisputed leader of the 
Muslim world. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2020, demographers estimate that the Muslim population will be 2.5 
billion, double the present total and more than one-quarter of the projected 
world population in the first quarter of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
The Third World, which would account for more than 80% of the projected world 
population by then, would provide fertile ground for the Islamic revolution, 
the hard-liners argue. 
</P>
<P>
When a 1986 census showed that 11 million Iranians had been born since the 
revolution, then-Prime Minister Hussein Moussavi publicly rejoiced that they 
had been reared to the credo of "Death to America!" and "Allahu akbar!" or "God 
is great!" 
</P>
<P>
The radical daily Jomhuri Islami noted recently amid a broadside of press 
criticism of birth control: "The problem is not the increasing population, but 
the lack of policy and planning, and in the end it is the unfortunate 
population that gets the blame." 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's postwar development plan calls for building 12 industrial cities 
in five years to help absorb the swelling population. 
</P>
<P>
Tehran's population has swollen to an estimated 8 million in recent years amid 
a widespread drift from the countryside to urban areas. Officials say the city 
is bursting at the seams, with housing, water and electricity shortages, 
traffic-clogged streets and worsening pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Oil-rich Iran was able to feed itself 10 years ago, but now has to import $2 
billion worth of food a year. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural output has slumped severely. In 1979, one-third of the population 
worked in that sector. Now, government figures show that it is only one-fifth.

EUROPE DEALS WITH FALLOUT FOR PAST SUPPORT OF BRUTAL CEAUSESCU REGIME; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENTS: THE EXECUTED HEAD OF ROMANIA NOW HAS FEW DEFENDERS. POLITICAL 
BLASTS ARE MORE STRIDENT IN FRANCE, WHICH WAS ONE OF HIS STRONGEST BACKERS.

<P>
Now that he has been toppled and executed, Nicolae Ceausescu has few defenders, 
his rank secure among the century's most brutal and despised dictators. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't so long ago that the Romanian president was the West's favorite 
Communist, showered with kind words and economic benefits for his role as a 
maverick in the East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
France was especially friendly toward Ceausescu's Romania for many years, 
seeing a people with cultural affinities as well as a country whose 
independence from the Soviet Union could be a mirror-image for French refusal 
to follow U.S. foreign policy leads. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the Romanian revolution, France is now seeing apologies and 
recriminations, as politicians and parties accuse each other of being slow to 
realize the scope of Ceausescu's abuses of power. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the change of heart has taken a different form. Queen Elizabeth II 
stripped Ceausescu of his honorary knighthood "as a mark of revulsion at the 
abuse of human rights in Romania." 
</P>
<P>
King Olav V of Norway took away his honorary Grand Cross of St. Olav Order and, 
by action of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, the Romanian leader was no longer a 
Knight of the Elephant Order when he went before the firing squad. 
</P>
<P>
All three monarchs acted after Ceausescu was driven from power, wiping out 
honors that had been awarded about a decade earlier, when Romania's reputation 
was at its height. 
</P>
<P>
The process of exposing crimes and repressions in the aftermath of Ceausescu's 
ouster is similar to what followed the demise of other dictators this century, 
such as Josef Stalin in the Soviet Union, Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, 
Idi Amin in Uganda and Jean-Bedel Bokassa of the Central African Republic. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until early this year that the United States withdrew Romania's 
valuable status as "most favored nation" for trade purposes, on grounds of 
human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1986, Reagan Administration officials were defending Romania's 
favored nation status, with Edward J. Derwinski, counselor of the State 
Department, telling a hostile congressional committee that Romania had an 
"overall reasonably good record" on allowing people to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's reputation for free thinking was earned in foreign affairs. At 
home, he ruled a police state that used a repressive security apparatus to 
stamp out dissent. 
</P>
<P>
He condemned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and refused to join the 
1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia that ended the "Prague Spring" liberalization 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu also stood apart from the other Communist countries when he 
maintained links with Israel after the 1967 Middle East War, eventually serving 
as mediator between Israel and Egypt in the talks that led to their peace 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
The gratitude won as the Jewish state's only ally in a hostile Communist Bloc 
has survived, although Israel condemned massive killings by the secret police 
and pledged support for Romania's new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Speaking as Jews and Israelis we cannot forget the general point, we cannot 
remember our enemies and forget our friends," Israel's former ambassador to 
Bucharest, Abba Geffen, said recently on Israel radio. "We must not enter into 
the anti-Ceausescu hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
Anti-Ceausescu sentiment was mostly to be found in Moscow back in 1969, when 
Richard M. Nixon chose Romania for the first visit by a U.S. president to a 
Warsaw Pact country. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon and Ceausescu delighted crowds by joining in a traditional Romanian 
peasant dance, with a Romanian girl dancing between them. Their joint statement 
talked of a "spirit of cordiality, sincerity and mutual respect." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the 1960s, French President Charles de Gaulle blazed the trail of 
ties between the West and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"De Gaulle was following a policy of independence vis-a-vis the United States. 
France was seeking an ally in the East. Ceausescu was following a similar path 
in the Warsaw Pact," said Ewa Kulesza, an expert on Eastern Europe at the 
French Institute for International Relations in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a kind of identification between De Gaulle's France and Ceausescu's 
Romania. It was an illusion," she said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
The illusion, based in part on cultural associations between France and 
Romania, whose languages are similar, was long-lasting. 
</P>
<P>
Claude Cheysson, former French foreign minister who visited Romania in 1983, 
apologized for his role in an interview recently published in the leftist daily 
newspaper Liberation. 
</P>
<P>
"We should have been more clear in our denunciations of what we knew, of what 
we guessed about Romania, so that perhaps we could have precipitated the 
movements that we see now," Cheysson was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing accused the current Socialist 
government of not doing enough to call attention to Ceausescu's misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
Socialist leaders criticized Giscard d'Estaing for exchanging visits with 
Ceausescu -- while President Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, at least 
scrapped a planned visit to Romania in 1982, although he cited scheduling 
problems rather than human rights abuses. The trip was never rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Giscard d'Estaing replied, in an interview in the rightist newspaper Le Figaro, 
that he "personally felt a strong antipathy" for Ceausescu after their 1980 
encounter in France, and said the translator at their session could confirm it. 
</P>
<P>
The heaviest fire has focused on Georges Marchais, the hard-line French 
Communist Party leader, who vacationed on Ceausescu's yacht in 1984. Dissidents 
in the party recently called on Marchais and the entire Politburo to resign 
because of their past support for Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo replied that Marchais had not seen Ceausescu in five years and 
had made many quiet appeals to the Romanian leader for respect of human rights.

IRAQI TRANSLATOR DELIGHTS IN HAVING SHAKESPEARE PLAYERS SPEAK ARABIC; 
</P>
<P>
LITERATURE: IT TOOK 24 YEARS OF 'AGONY AND PLEASURE' FOR HIM TO TRANSLATE 6 
PLAYS AND 40 SONNETS. NOW HE SAYS HE'S THROUGH.

<P>
Love's labor has not been lost for Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, one of the giants of 
contemporary Arab letters who has translated Shakespeare's plays and sonnets 
into Arabic. Critics say they are the best translations of The Bard yet in 
Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
It took him 24 years, from 1959 to 1983, to translate "Hamlet," "Coriolanus," 
"King Lear," "Macbeth," "Othello," "The Tempest" and 40 of the sonnets. 
</P>
<P>
Now he says that's it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to translate all his plays," Jabra said in an interview at his home 
in a fashionable Baghdad suburb. "But after finishing 'The Tempest' I realized 
it was virtually impossible. I'd never have the time to do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
He said "The Tempest," which he completed in 1979, was the toughest to 
translate because "it was deceptively lyrical, which makes it very difficult to 
render in another language." 
</P>
<P>
"His translations of Shakespeare and other Western works are very, very 
beautiful," said Professor Abbas al-Tonsi of the American University in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Eisa Abu-Shamsieh, an Arab academic, noted in a literary thesis on Jabra that 
his Shakespeare translations "as well as scholarly studies on Shakespeare's 
works stand as a remarkable contribution to the modern Arabic drama in 
particular, and literature in general. His accuracy in translation is a 
characteristic upon which his critics agree." 
</P>
<P>
Jabra, 69, is one of the most prolific and versatile Arab writers; he is a 
novelist, poet, essayist, critic and translator as well as artist. 
</P>
<P>
He has translated Oscar Wilde, Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Chekov, Andre 
Maurois, Walt Whitman, Dylan Thomas, Ezra Pound, Edith Sitwell and William 
Faulkner along with many English poets such as Shelley, Keats, Dryden and 
Byron. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a year to do 'Hamlet,' the first Shakespeare play I translated," 
Jabra said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an agony and a pleasure," he added, sitting in his study lined with 
books in Arabic, English and French as well as paintings and sculptures by 
himself and other Iraqi artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something I'd always wanted to do. I'd had this ambition since I was a 
young man," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I first read 'Julius Caesar' in Jerusalem when I was a boy I'd 
always wondered if it was possible to make Shakespeare's characters talk in 
Arabic without losing the force of his words in English." 
</P>
<P>
When he studied at Cambridge University in England, he found that Arabic 
translations of Shakespeare were "verbally awkward, strangely static." 
</P>
<P>
So he decided to do his own and found himself immersed in "the almost 
impossible task" of sustaining the "same verbal charge, the evocative imagery, 
sustained metaphors, diversity of rhythm and tone, the eloquence and the word 
play" into another language. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from such works as his novel "Hunters in a Narrow Street," which was 
originally written in English and published in 1960, and several collections of 
poetry, he has written seven major novels in Arabic, among them "The Ship," 
"The Search For Walid Masoud" and "The Other Rooms." 
</P>
<P>
Professor Tonsi noted: "Jabra and another novelist, Abdel-Rahman Munir, are 
considered the only two Arab novelists whose influence could go beyond that of 
Naguib Mahfouz," who won the 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature. 
</P>
<P>
Jabra was born in Bethlehem in pre-1948 Palestine, the son of a Christian 
farmer who fell on hard times, forcing the family to move to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
There, Jabra quit school to work as a carpenter and plumber. But he continued 
studying at the Arab College and later went to Cambridge. In 1952-54, he 
studied at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Palestine in 1943 and worked as a teacher in Jerusalem before 
being driven into exile, at the age of 29, when the state of Israel was 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
Exile has been one of the central creative forces of his life, engendering a 
passion for his Arab heritage and Arab nationalism. He converted to Islam in 
Baghdad, where he wound up in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
He taught English literature at Baghdad's College of Arts and, he said, 
"preached change unashamedly." 
</P>
<P>
He said he told his students: "We lost Palestine because we had confronted a 
ruthless force with an outmoded tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been cheated and betrayed by thousands of years of decay. We've been 
victims of our insane rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
Jabra noted as he puffed on his ever-present pipe: "Change has to begin with a 
change of vision, with a new way of looking at things." 
</P>
<P>
Jabra's understanding of the West and European literature has combined with a 
burning belief, shared by many Arab intellectuals, that the Arab world has to 
change in all facets of life to survive and preserve its rich heritage. 
</P>
<P>
The heroes of his novels are generally Arab intellectuals standing alone, 
facing up to the unknown and dreaming of change.

Leader Moammar Kadafi said capitalism and Western-style democracy could ravage 
reformist Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
He told a news conference in Tripoli that if Eastern Europe adopts a "Western 
European system with its multi-parties and capitalism, I warn you of 
unemployment and beggars, of inflation, crises and, in the end, war." In a 
surprise departure, the rabidly anti-Israeli Kadafi accused the West of 
plotting to rid the world of Jews by placing them in "Palestine, the tomb of 
Jews, the mass oven for Jews." The Jews, he conceded, "are oppressed in the 
world," adding that Libya "would welcome them back."

Iran dismissed an Iraqi proposal for reviving peace talks between the two

agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatch said Iraq's three-point plan merely rewords previous Iraqi 
demands. Talks on a permanent end to the eight-year conflict have been 
stalemated since a cease-fire in August, 1988. IRNA noted that Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein failed to address simultaneous withdrawal of his troops and the 
repatriation of thousands of prisoners of war -- key Iranian demands.

of killing more than 200 unarmed citizens in an attempt to overthrow the 
Liberian government. "We will carry out a massive search. Furnish us with 
information if you want to be on the safe side," Doe told thousands of cheering 
supporters at a rally in Monrovia to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the 
former sergeant's inauguration.

ONCE-EXCLUSIVE PRAGUE HOTEL FOR PARTY BIGWIGS TO OPEN DOORS TO PUBLIC -- FOR 
PRICE

<P>
A Prague hotel so exclusive that not even a visiting millionaire could get a 
room has thrown open its imposing doors and plans to go commercial. 
</P>
<P>
For eight years a veil of mystery hung over the Praha Hotel, property of the 
Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and reserved for the exclusive use of its 
officials and visiting foreign dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, it has been opened to outsiders, ending one of many taboos swept 
away after weeks of popular unrest that forced the party to relinquish its 
monopoly on power. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Praha's doors are palatial suites, a luxury sports center and a 
theater -- where officials enjoyed private screenings of Western films they had 
banned for the public. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of uniformed staff glide noiselessly through its long corridors, but 
because of the severe restrictions on entry there has rarely been a guest to be 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
"Now things will be different," manager Jan Dite told Reuters in what he said 
was his first interview with a Western correspondent. "We'll have to get used 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
Management said the hotel, built in 1981 at an undisclosed cost, will go 
commercial early this year -- although it will remain the property of the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary rooms will cost about $100 a night, enough to burn a hole in the 
pockets of Westerners and certainly beyond the reach of ordinary Czechs. 
</P>
<P>
But the move is at least a concession to opposition demands that party members 
forfeit privileges that include not only use of the hotel but also special 
health care and access to secret stores stocked with luxury meats and dairy 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
Dite admitted that the hotel had been losing money since it was built but would 
not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
"We were subsidized from the party's budget. Our average occupancy rate has 
been less than 50%," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The six-story, horseshoe-shaped building has a tropical garden in its central 
atrium. Room balconies -- all of which face south -- offer an exquisite view of 
the once royal Hradcany Castle and chandeliers light its grand marble 
staircase.- 
</P>
<P>
The 116 rooms with terrace gardens include 32 "small" and eight "presidential" 
suites. A small suite is actually bigger than many family apartments in Prague. 
The manager graciously declined to show any of the presidential suites. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel can sleep 200 people and employs a staff of 350, Dite said. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities include a circular indoor swimming pool, a well-used bowling alley, 
pool tables, a sauna, tennis and volleyball courts, a beauty shop, a cinema and 
a massage parlor. 
</P>
<P>
But its miles of wood-paneling, hundreds of black leather armchairs and public 
rooms resembling vast caverns exude the grim, moody atmosphere of a place that 
is too big and too empty. 
</P>
<P>
Only during party congresses and on other special occasions has the building 
ever come to life. 
</P>
<P>
At those times the hotel teemed with officials. Fleets of chauffeur-driven 
Tatra limousines would wait outside to take them to the congress in the Palace 
of Culture, another huge structure nicknamed "Moby Dick." 
</P>
<P>
For years locals eyed the hotel, built on the site of a former public park, 
with a mixture of awe and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
They told tales of 18 underground floors, private elevators to suites, a secret 
tunnel from the subway stop nearby, wild parties and call girls. 
</P>
<P>
None of those stories could ever be verified, however.

REVIVAL OF CZECH JEWRY HOPED FOR AS COMMUNIST POWER MONOPOLY ENDS 
</P>

<P>
The ancient Jewish quarter of Prague is alive with new hope for a revival of 
Czech Jewry now that the capital's dwindling, 1,000-year-old Jewish community 
has been freed from the tight control of the Communist authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In a rebellion sparked by the broader one that led to the end of the Communist 
Party's monopoly of power, Czech Jews have ousted two state-salaried leaders 
whom they accused of autocratically aligning the Jewish community with the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"Without freedom and democracy it is not possible to have a fully Jewish life," 
newly reinstalled community president Desider Galsky told Reuters during an 
interview in the 17th-Century Jewish town hall. 
</P>
<P>
"This small community had no space. Everything we did was controlled and 
required permission. Now I am sure there can be a renaissance of Jewish life . 
. . From day to day more young people are coming here and joining us." 
</P>
<P>
Galsky was reinstated as president of the Council of Jewish Religious 
Communities in Bohemia and Moravia Dec. 3 at a stormy meeting attended by 200 
members which forced Bohumil Heller to give up the position and removed 
Frantisek Kraus from his post of community secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from frequently denouncing Israel, Heller and Kraus -- without consulting 
other Jews -- had written several letters published in the party newspaper in 
which they supported security force violence to break up anti-government 
demonstrations. They also sponsored an international conference promoting the 
Soviet stance in arms control talks. 
</P>
<P>
Heller and Kraus were installed in 1985 after the Ministry of Culture, 
responsible for religious affairs, ordered Galsky, 68, a retired publishing 
house editor, to be removed as community president, citing what it described as 
his undesirably close ties with the West. 
</P>
<P>
There are now 6,000 registered Jews in Czechoslovakia, most of them in Prague. 
Two of the half dozen synagogues in the capital are still in regular use, but 
Prague -- once one of Europe's most important centers of Jewish learning -- has 
only one rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
Galsky said he will work to expand opportunities for Jewish education and 
cultural life, partly by inviting guest scholars from abroad. He also said he 
will promote awareness of the community among non-Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Elections to a 25-member governing board are due in February, the first such 
free poll among the Jews since the 1948 Communist takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Another priority is to restore community control of the State Jewish Museum, an 
unparalleled collection of books and ritual objects seized by the Nazis. It was 
handed over by the community to the government in the 1950s, a period marked by 
a series of show trials involving Jewish communists. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of Judaic treasures from the collection toured the United States 
in 1983 but it has never been shown in Prague. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a moral right and duty to know what they are doing with these things," 
Galsky said of the state administrators. 
</P>
<P>
Czech Jewry numbered some 340,000 before World War II. More than 40,000 
survivors remained in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
About 20,000 emigrated in the next two years and a second wave left after the 
1968 Soviet-led invasion when "Zionists" were assigned partial blame for the 
"Prague Spring" liberalization movement. 
</P>
<P>
A book propagating this theory won two official literary awards. However, a 
letter published in the Socialist Party newspaper in late December demanded 
that the author, Alexej Pludek, repudiate the work. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1989 a small group of younger Jews demanded improved opportunities 
for Hebrew language education and greater access to Jewish literature, which 
had been strictly limited under communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Young scholars have worked in secret to translate Talmudic and other Jewish 
texts into Czech, often harassed by state police who kept a close watch on all 
community activities and those of other religious denominations. 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-five years after the end of the war, we are reaching a state when time 
could well complete what the Nazi genocide began -- our Jewish life is in 
danger of extinction," the group wrote in a letter challenging Heller and 
Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
Galsky has pledged to meet the group's demands and has begun scheduling 
community lectures, films, meetings and holiday celebrations without consulting 
state authorities, although this is still required by law. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no return to the old society," he said. The community supports a 
proposal by the opposition movement Civic Forum to separate the state from 
involvement in religious affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The World Jewish Congress and the Joint Distribution Committee, an American aid 
group, have offered increased financial support for the Czech Jewish community, 
Galsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Pavlat, 39, an orthodox Jew, said he believes Galsky's return to the 
leadership will help restore the reputation of a community badly tarnished 
under Heller and Kraus.

Transit Authority President David Gunn, who spent the last six years rebuilding 
the nation's largest transportation system, said Friday he will resign Feb. 28 
to get "some new blood at the top." 
</P>
<P>
"I have no plans at the moment, other than to split some wood and do some 
hiking," said Gunn, 52. His resignation came five days after the inauguration 
of Mayor David Dinkins and an increase in subway and bus fares from $1 to 
$1.15.

TIBETANS AND CHINESE DIVIDED BY WIDE, BITTER GULF OF MISUNDERSTANDING

<P>
Before the brother of Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, returned 
to Lhasa as a guest of the Chinese government after years in exile, officials 
met local people and urged them not to spit or hurl stones at their former 
"slave master." 
</P>
<P>
The guests duly arrived -- but far from being abused they found themselves 
greeted by thousands of weeping and prostrating Tibetans anxious to touch them. 
</P>
<P>
In scenes at once embarrassing and shocking for Chinese authorities, some 
Tibetans even chanted pro-independence slogans and wished the absent Dalai Lama 
eternal life. 
</P>
<P>
That was 10 years ago, and a Tibetan intellectual who recounted the scene said 
a gulf of misunderstanding between the Chinese who rule the Himalayan region 
and its 2 million people continues. 
</P>
<P>
Frustration and long-held grievances burst into the open again in 1987 when 
Buddhist monks began nationalist protests. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to control the simmering ethnic conflict with police alone, the central 
government last March called in the army and imposed martial law in Lhasa. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, state-run newspapers and television have shown smiling Tibetans 
offering food and drink to grateful soldiers. Tibetans are told they welcome 
martial law. 
</P>
<P>
"Martial law meets people's aspirations. All events reflect that people are at 
peace in their hearts. Their livelihoods and social order are guaranteed," Col. 
Feng Lanqun said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
"The overwhelming majority of people support martial law. Lots of Tibetans took 
food to the soldiers . . . I am very optimistic about the future," said trade 
official Li Shiping, who has lived in Tibet for 17 years and, like most ethnic 
Han Chinese officials there, does not speak Tibetan. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the Tibetan intellectual tried to explain, looking over a shoulder 
for fear of being overheard by police, unrest in Tibet has ancient roots and 
will not be so easily resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, many people want the troops to go home and the leaders know this. 
Monks give apples and tea to the soldiers -- but out of their Buddhist 
principles of compassion, not because they support martial law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In October with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Dalai Lama, the gap 
between rulers and ruled appeared as wide as ever. China denounced the prize 
and Tibetans celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
Two small groups of nuns tried to demonstrate in Lhasa but were quickly 
arrested and sent to labor camps for up to three years, residents and relatives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Tibetans and the ethnic Han Chinese are evident. Visiting a 
monastery accompanied by an official guide, a foreign reporter stopped to chat 
with an old monk and finally asked him how he saw the state of relations. 
</P>
<P>
"Hard to say," he answered and walked off to the evident distress of the 
official. 
</P>
<P>
In tea houses, some young Tibetans speak in a much more radical terms. They 
talk of taking up arms and fighting for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Han Chinese usually do not wander alone around the narrow streets and 
markets of Lhasa's Tibetan quarter, especially at night. But on the edge of 
town, amid utilitarian modern buildings, young Tibetans dance at the same disco 
with Chinese -- many of them police and soldiers in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are Tibetans and Hans here," said a young Han working in the Lhasa 
Hotel, dancing under the strobe lights. "But mostly Tibetans dance with 
Tibetans and Hans with Hans." 
</P>
<P>
To win the hearts and minds of the Tibetan people, China said it is pouring 
money into the region at the rate of $190 million to $220 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Schools that were forced to use Chinese for instruction during China's radical 
1966-1976 Cultural Revolution have revived the Tibetan language. 
</P>
<P>
The region's only university has 1,005 students, 730 of them Tibetan. Only 20% 
of courses are now taught in Tibetan but the proportion is rising. 
</P>
<P>
"We are raising bilingual workers . . . We are recovering Tibetan language and 
culture," said University President Ciwang Junmei. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say Peking is giving $9 million toward restoration of the vast Potala 
Palace -- the Dalai Lama's former winter residence, which dominates Lhasa and 
is in danger of collapsing on crowds of pilgrims worshipping there. 
</P>
<P>
Monasteries that were among several thousand destroyed during the Cultural 
Revolution are being repaired and some monks have returned, although their 
numbers are limited by the state. 
</P>
<P>
Living standards have risen considerably since the late 1970s, thanks largely 
to the economic freedoms secured under capitalist-style reforms. But average 
annual incomes are less than $110, among the lowest in China. 
</P>
<P>
Tibetans argue that government subsidies often go toward housing and imported 
Japanese vehicles for officials and big projects, such as a vast government 
guest house in Lhasa. 
</P>
<P>
"China may give millions of yuan a year in subsidies to Tibet but little of it 
reaches the people," said one Tibetan. 
</P>
<P>
"They are so ungrateful. We give them so much money," said a young Han Chinese 
worker, one of many sent to the region from neighboring provinces. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like Lhasa. I don't like Tibetans. No, I don't have Tibetan friends," 
the woman said, adding that she misses the child she had to leave behind in 
Sichuan province. 
</P>
<P>
Even most educated Chinese sensitive to Tibet's cultural identity uphold the 
official line that the region has been part of China since the Mongolian Yuan 
dynasty 700 years ago and that independence is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say China's key to ensuring peace in Tibet lies in boosting living 
standards and reviving Tibetan culture. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dalai Lama's influence in the economy, culture and politics is getting 
smaller and smaller," said regional government spokesman Gong Liefu.

Sharon Bluntschley, 31, formerly of Kirtland, turned herself in to police at

SURVIVORS SHARE MEMORIES OF 'JEWISH TRAGEDY'

Before the desperate Jewish resistance leaders smuggled him into the Warsaw 
ghetto and a Nazi concentration camp, they apologized to the young, Catholic, 
Polish underground member. "We are sorry," they told 28-year-old Jan Karski one 
day in late September, 1942, "that you will have to take such memories as these 
with you throughout your life." 
</P>
<P>
He was used to danger, this Jan Karski, who served as a courier between the 
underground in Poland and the Polish government-in-exile from 1939 to 1943. 
Four times he had picked his way across Nazi-dominated Europe on secret 
missions. Captured by the Soviets in 1939, he escaped. Arrested by the Gestapo 
in 1940, he was tortured and tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide in order to 
protect underground secrets. A daring rescue effort by the Polish underground 
finally freed him. 
</P>
<P>
All this was nothing to him; danger had become a way of life for the young man 
whose life as a diplomat had been ambushed in 1939 by the whims of war. 
</P>
<P>
But this secret mission proposed by the two Jewish underground leaders involved 
danger of a different sort: The danger of being haunted by memories that cannot 
be tamed and processed by the civilized, conscious mind. It is the stuff of 
which nightmares are made. Still, the Jews felt that they had no choice but to 
ask the young man. The silence must be broken, they said, and the world 
informed of the terrible things happening in the Warsaw ghetto and in the 
camps. And then they set forth their proposal: 
</P>
<P>
We know Hitler has decided on the total destruction of the Jews in Europe. This 
is our end. The Jews are totally helpless. The Poles may save individuals but 
they cannot stop extermination. You must take our message to London and you 
must try to get in touch with as many Allied leaders as possible. You must 
convince them that only the powerful Western Allies can help now. 
</P>
<P>
There is a pause and the voice telling you this story stops; a lighter flares 
and the first of many cigarettes is lighted. Then the heavily accented voice 
continues: 
</P>
<P>
But we know England; we know the West. What you are going to tell them is 
unprecedented. They may have doubts. It would help us if you could say that you 
saw it with your own eyes. We could smuggle you into the ghetto in Warsaw. No 
danger whatsoever to you. I will be your guide. And we could try to smuggle you 
into the Belzec camp. This is dangerous but we wouldn't expose you to certain 
death. Will you go? 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I will go,' " recalls Karski now, stopping to tap out a cigarette in 
an ashtray, a move that reveals the faint scars on his wrist -- remnants of the 
suicide attempt almost half a century ago. He is sitting in the living room of 
his tidy, white house in the suburbs of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
But Karski is not here; he is back in the season of memory, back in the Poland 
of World War II: 
</P>
<P>
"And then we went. Twice I saw the ghetto. I . . . saw . . . horrible . . . 
things," he says slowly. "The first time I couldn't take it. We left. But then 
I said: 'I want to go again. I want to see.' It was not difficult to get in." 
</P>
<P>
Nor out. Unless you were a Jew. 
</P>
<P>
To get into the concentration camp, he dressed in a soldier's uniform. "I spent 
20 minutes, 30 minutes in Belzec," says Karski, now 75 and a semiretired 
adjunct professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. "I 
couldn't take it," he says, blinking his eyes against the tears. 
</P>
<P>
Karski had been charged by the leaders of the Jewish resistance to tell the 
Western leaders about the impending extermination of an entire people and to 
demand that they take steps to halt it. Accordingly, in 1943, he met with top 
Allied leaders, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Foreign 
Secretary Anthony Eden. In the United States, he also had face-to-face meetings 
with Justice Felix Frankfurter and other Jewish intellectuals and leaders. 
</P>
<P>
His reports to them included information about the desperate situation of the 
Jews in Poland. Afterward, he felt his "Jewish message" was largely ignored by 
the Allied leaders. "I thought it might help; it didn't," he says. In 1943 he 
was unable to return to Poland because of the danger involved. The following 
year, he wrote a book about his experiences and delivered more than 200 
speeches in this country, always speaking of "the Jewish tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
"It was pure duty," he says now of his commitment to speaking out. "At the 
time, I had to do it." 
</P>
<P>
At war's end, however, Karski retreated into silence about his wartime 
experiences. He made the United States his home and enrolled at Georgetown 
University as a graduate student. After three years, he earned his doctorate in 
government (he already had a double master's in law and diplomatic history 
earned before the war) and began a 37-year career as a highly respected 
professor at Georgetown. In 1985 he produced a massive book, "The Great Powers 
and Poland, 1919-1945," which was hailed as a "truly remarkable work." 
</P>
<P>
He was "bitter," he says, at war's end when the leaders of the Western world 
expressed horror and surprise at what had happened in the concentration camps. 
He argues that it was impossible for them not to know. 
</P>
<P>
"But please don't write that Karski is the first one to inform the Western 
leaders," he says. "That is a nonsense. There were Jewish escapees who had gone 
to Switzerland and Sweden, passing secret reports. The Polish underground had 
daily communication with London, reporting the situation of the Jews. And, most 
important, the Allied governments had secret agents in every country. So to 
argue the leaders did not know is a nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
"But after the war American, British, French leaders, church officials -- they 
go to Auschwitz, to Treblinka, to Buchenwald. Their comments were always the 
same. 'We didn't know that such things were possible. We were not aware of it.' 
(Gen. Dwight D.) Eisenhower visited a concentration camp, and the press 
reported that Eisenhower was so moved that he 'lost power of speech' for a few 
moments. Reading what those leaders were saying -- that it was a secret, they 
didn't know -- I was disgusted. Disgusted. And I don't hesitate to use this 
word. It was then I got out of this business of the war. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be integrated into American life as soon as possible," Karski 
says. "The same with my wife, Pola Nirenska. She is Jewish. All of her family 
left in Poland perished. In the ghettos, in the concentration camps, in gas 
chambers. We never discuss the war at home." 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, deeper into the interview, he will explain his need to distance 
himself from the past in a more emotional way: "I wanted to run away after the 
war," he will say in a halting voice. "I saw too much. I saw too much misery, 
hatred, ruthlessness, human losses." He will stop, search for the words. "I . . 
. saw . . . horrible . . . things. What I learned from the war made me silent 
for 30 years. I buried myself in the anonymous academic community." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, a phone call from a concentration camp survivor persuaded Jan Karski 
to break his silence. 
</P>
<P>
The caller was Elie Wiesel, survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald, an author and 
professor at Boston University, who would be awarded in 1986 the Nobel Prize 
for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Elie Wiesel, then the chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial 
Committee, was organizing a unique international conference to be held in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to bring together people from all over the world who had liberated 
the (concentration) camps," says Wiesel. "Not the survivors, but the people who 
had liberated us. The first people to have seen us, to have seen hell, were in 
a very special category. So I brought to Washington liberators and also people 
who tried to prevent the tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Karski was invited to speak at the International Conference of Liberators in 
Washington in October, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I said I would not do it," Karski says, recalling his telephone 
conversation with Wiesel. 
</P>
<P>
"I am telling you that you will come," was Wiesel's response. 
</P>
<P>
"And so I did go," says Karski now, imitating with affection Wiesel's insistent 
tone. "I gave my report, it lasted 35 minutes, and they filmed it. Then came 
the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
"No speaker affected the audience as much as Karski," recalls Wiesel, "He 
received an ovation." 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time that the conference took place, Karski received a letter 
from filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, who was working on "Shoah," a monumental 
documentary of the Holocaust. After some reluctance, Karski agreed to be 
interviewed. "It was my duty to do it," he says simply. 
</P>
<P>
From eight hours of taped interviews with Karski, about 40 minutes were used in 
the 9 1/2-hour film. 
</P>
<P>
It was a very difficult experience for Karski. "A few times I broke down," he 
recalls. "My wife could not stand it. She left the house." The end result, he 
feels, "is the greatest film ever made on the Jewish Holocaust." 
</P>
<P>
Wiesel makes an observation about Karski: "He is a man of absolute integrity, 
of extraordinary force of character. But I had the feeling from the moment I 
met him that he was a wounded person, that he carried secret, invisible wounds 
in him. The moment we touched on a certain area, I saw he was fighting the 
memories. I saw the tears in his eyes. I was very moved by the man." 
</P>
<P>
There's a pause. Then: "But I think he feels that he failed," Wiesel says. "He 
tried to speak and people didn't want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
The past, someone observed, is a foreign country; they do things differently 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"I will tell you this -- Jan Karski is not my family name; it is an assumed 
name," says the man sitting opposite you. He says his real name is Kozielewski, 
and he grew up in a large, devout Catholic family. From his youth, he planned 
to enter the diplomatic life. He smiles. "But then, most of my life turned out 
to be not planned. Once the war started . . . " and here he searches for a 
word, "accidents took over." 
</P>
<P>
In Karski's home there is a room filled with awards, medals, plaques and 
scrolls, each honoring one deed or another performed by the young underground 
courier who, you might say, lived only in those few years between 1939 and 
1945. There is a tree bearing the name of Jan Karski in the Garden of the 
Righteous Gentiles at Yad Vashem memorial in Jerusalem. A poem appeared in 1988 
in The Nation magazine, written by Paul Genega and titled "The Courier." It was 
about Karski. 
</P>
<P>
Now, strolling with his 80-year-old wife in the bright sunlight of his garden, 
Karski is asked about his connection with the past, with the man who was 
captured and tortured and smuggled into the ghetto and met with the great 
leaders of the Western world. Is he still that Jan Karski? 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I will tell you," he says, blinking in the sun. "Who is Karski for me? I 
know thousands of people, and I will tell you frankly that the man who 
interests me the least is Jan Karski." He laughs. "I don't have an attachment 
to Jan Karski. I don't take him too seriously. I know him too well. What can I 
say? Jan Karski did what he had to do."

MASSACHUSETTS' DEBT WOES BRING NEW CLASS OF NEEDY

The state's economic woes are bringing a new kind of needy to Massachusetts' 
charitable organizations. People unaccustomed to scrambling for mortgage 
payments or to pay heating bills are seeking help, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely people coming in and saying 'I lost my job, I haven't 
worked in two weeks, I need help,' " said Jody Zeek, a clerk at the St. Vincent 
DePaul Society, a volunteer organization at the area's Catholic parishes. 
</P>
<P>
"I can tell almost immediately by their body language that this is not their 
cup of tea, but they are desperate," said Herbert Hershey, a social worker for 
the Salvation Army in Framingham. "They've had good jobs, but they are so 
desperate now they come in here for food and fuel." 
</P>
<P>
His chapter of the Salvation Army has helped 60% more people this year than the 
year before, Hershey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year I saw only those who were in emergencies, like fire, or the husband 
left, or something. But this year it's families who are suddenly without," 
Hershey said. 
</P>
<P>
One woman, a Framingham resident, had a computer job that paid her about 
$40,000 before she was laid off. Now she bags groceries for $6.50 an hour, 
trying to meet her mortgage payments, Hershey said. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart goes out to those who are very reluctant, very embarrassed. How can 
we help them?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Countie, the executive director of United Ways of Massachusetts, said 
layoffs and cuts in services provided by the state were pushing many families 
over the financial edge. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tremendous crisis," said Countie. "In our economy today, all of us 
live one paycheck to another, and when that gets interrupted, for families it's 
catastrophic." 
</P>
<P>
The state has been struggling to surmount an anticipated $825-million budget 
deficit. Last month, 706 state employees received layoff notices, according to 
figures released by state Administration and Finance Secretary L. Edward 
Lashman. By the end of December, the number of those laid off was expected to 
be more than 1,200.

Nine Fresno County Elections division employees are suspected of overbilling 
the county more than $1,600 in questionable travel expenses, according to a 
report by the county auditor. "The questionable expenses include excessive 
mileage claimed, meals claimed for what appears to be earlier-than-necessary 
departure or later-than-necessary return times and unnecessary car rentals," 
the report said. The report said that $1,272 of the questionable expenses were 
paid to Elections Manager Norma Logan, who has been on medical leave.

CHARLES W. FELIX JR., 46; CREATED MURALS IN LOS ANGELES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles W. (Cat) Felix Jr., an artist who came out of the East Los Angeles 
housing projects to create some of the city's most spectacular murals, has died 
at his Pico Rivera home at age 46. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Leonard, said he died Tuesday of a heart attack after surgery to 
remove a brain tumor. 
</P>
<P>
Best known as one of the lead artists for the Estrada Court murals on Olympic 
Boulevard between Grande Vista Avenue and Lorena Street, Felix most recently 
had been involved in nail-relief art, in which the heads of nails are used to 
make impressions. 
</P>
<P>
That work ranged from portraits of Aztec gods and warriors to horses, his 
brother said. 
</P>
<P>
Raised in East Los Angeles, Felix was one of the first artists involved in the 
Estrada Court murals, where neighbors and artists alike participated. The 
ongoing project, started in 1973, was funded by the city and depicts Chicano 
life and culture. 
</P>
<P>
Felix is survived by his wife, Sherry, a son, two brothers, two sisters and his 
mother.

EX-PRODIGY'S PRODIGIOUS MEMORY MAKES RECALL OF NUMBERS EASY AS PI; 
</P>
<P>
THE MIND: IN 1981, RAJAN SRINIVASEN MAHADEVAN QUALIFIED FOR GUINNESS BOOK OF 
WORLD RECORDS BY RECITING 31,811 DIGITS OF PI. BUT HE CAN STILL FORGET WHERE HE 
PUT HIS KEYS.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's only fitting that Rajan's story begin with a number: MYX1689, the number 
that started it all. 
</P>
<P>
MYX554 was the license plate on the second car that pulled up to the house in 
Mangalore, India, where his parents were having a party. MYX558 was the third. 
</P>
<P>
Some other 5-year-old might have sung a song or passed hors d'oeuvres to show 
off to the grown-ups: Rajan Srinivasen Mahadevan recited the license plates of 
all 40 cars in the order in which they had been parked. 
</P>
<P>
That was the first anyone knew of Rajan's astonishing memory. Twenty-seven 
years later, millions know of it, and there are days when he wishes he had sung 
a song or passed hors d'oeuvres. 
</P>
<P>
A memory that can hold fast to 31,811 random numbers yet persistently forgets 
where keys have been left is a curious thing, a wondrous oddity that can bring 
opportunity, fame -- perhaps even immortality -- to its owner. 
</P>
<P>
But what of the other things a man has -- humor, creativity, intellect? 
</P>
<P>
"This damn thing overpowers everything else, to a point," Rajan said. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, he said in the fluid, accented English he was reared with, "I used 
to be so lost in my own thoughts, I would talk to myself. It was hard to fit 
in. Other kids didn't know what to make of me." 
</P>
<P>
Rajan's memory was not unexpected. "It's like John Lennon's son and music," he 
said. His father, a prominent surgeon, knows all 2,156 lines of William 
Shakespeare's 154 sonnets. 
</P>
<P>
"I was expected to make it big in life. But my academic career was like the 
drawing of a mountain range." 
</P>
<P>
Rajan tried engineering and business administration but felt no affinity for 
either. Then, someone suggested that he put his memory to the test by trying to 
win a place in the Guinness Book of World Records. 
</P>
<P>
He began studying a computer printout of the first 200,000 decimal places of 
pi, the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle. Pi, the 
ultimate test of numerical memory, begins 3.14159, then continues on 
indefinitely with no known duplication or pattern. Two Columbia University 
mathematicians recently calculated pi to 480 million decimal places. 
</P>
<P>
On June 12, 1980, Rajan flew to Chicago, where he stunned the fifth 
International Congress on Yoga and Meditation by reciting the first 10,000 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
On July 5, 1981, he stood before a capacity crowd in a Mangalore meeting hall 
and rattled off numbers so quickly that the judges could barely keep up. For 
three hours and 49 minutes, his memory never faltered. Then, finally, a lapse: 
He forgot the 31,812th digit of pi -- a 5. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind. The record -- 20,013 -- had toppled. "On Feb. 16, 1983, I saw my 
name in the Book of Records, and I relaxed. That was the argument stopper. 
Until then, people could say: 'So you have a good memory, so what?' 
</P>
<P>
"But, from 1981 to 1987, I was the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, that honor went to Hideaki Tomoyori of Japan for reciting 40,000 
digits in 17 hours, 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, memory expert Charles Thompson, a Kansas State University psychology 
professor, believes that Rajan's memory is superior. "The Japanese guy made up 
a story, a mnemonic, to help him remember the numbers. His memory isn't as 
good." 
</P>
<P>
In the lab where Thompson is studying Rajan's memory, numbers flash past on a 
computer screen, one a second, and Rajan responds as if to music. He taps his 
feet and rocks rhythmically back and forth in his chair. Now and then, he 
jiggles his legs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's something about the way the numbers sound," he said. "It's not the way 
they look, it's the way they sound." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Rajan finds the numbers in pi from the 2,901th to 3,000th places 
-- 81911979399520614196 and so on -- particularly melodic. The series between 
3,701 to 3,800 -- beginning 2332609729 -- is "very jarring." 
</P>
<P>
"Just as you can't describe how you remember your phone number, neither can 
Rajan describe the process by which he remembers pi," said Thompson, who, along 
with Jerome Frieman, an animal behaviorist, and Thaddeus Cowan, a cognitive 
psychologist, has been trying since January to figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we tested him, we said, 'Oh my God!' " 
</P>
<P>
Thompson thinks Rajan may have the most remarkable numerical memory known to 
science since "S," a patient immortalized in clinical literature by A. R. 
Luria, the Soviet psychologist who studied him for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"S" was S. V. Shereshevskii, a Soviet newspaper reporter whose memory was 
discovered during the mid-1920s by an editor infuriated by his failure to take 
notes. "S" didn't need to; he recalled everything he'd ever seen or heard. 
</P>
<P>
What he couldn't do was forget. Ultimately, unable to distinguish between 
conversations he had heard five minutes or five years before, "S" wound up in 
an asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Rajan's memory is exceptional only for numbers. In all other areas -- names, 
faces, words -- it is average. And, unlike "S," he can forget, although "it is 
hard to willfully forget numbers." Random numbers memorized one session come 
flooding back during another. Keeping the sequences straight requires 
discipline and concentration. 
</P>
<P>
The tests he is undergoing are tedious. One test records ability to recall 
random digits that appear one a second on a screen. Ten is extraordinary; most 
people remember about seven. Rajan has recalled 64. 
</P>
<P>
His is not a photographic memory but a highly structured system of some sort, 
Thompson said. "Rajan has pi stored in a very systematic way in his brain." 
</P>
<P>
As photocopied from a textbook, the numbers are organized in blocks of a 
thousand, with five blocks to a page. "We'll say, 'Give us the 18,336th digit 
of pi.' " The time it takes Rajan to search his memory for the right block of 
one thousand, then the right hundred and, finally, to pinpoint the number, 
hints at how these storage and retrieval processes work. 
</P>
<P>
So does the occasional error. "If he makes a mistake, without fail he'll be in 
exactly the right spot but a thousand digits off. Or, he'll be in the right 
spot, only 10,000 digits off." Right position. Wrong page. 
</P>
<P>
A three-year National Institutes of Health grant pays for the research and for 
Rajan's work toward a master's degree in physiological psychology. "I want to 
know what neurons, what neurochemicals, are responsible for memory." 
</P>
<P>
The entire project "could be interesting and fun and yet not tell us a thing," 
Thompson said. "What we hope is that we're luckier than that. We hope his 
memory serves as a magnifying glass to show us how ordinary memory works. That 
will depend (on whether) we're clever enough and lucky enough to do the right 
tests. There are a jillion tests." 
</P>
<P>
As random numbers rush past, Rajan sometimes makes fleeting associations with 
formulas learned in physics, chemistry or mathematics, with distances between 
cities, with ZIP codes or historic dates. Now and then, he chuckles softly at 
some private numerical joke. As the computer spits out 1,8,6,5, he murmurs 
"Lincoln," who was assassinated that year. 
</P>
<P>
Such connections don't help him remember, he said. They are merely random 
thoughts that flit through his mind, small points of interest along the 
infinite journey through the decimal expansion of pi. 
</P>
<P>
With testing over for another day, Rajan would much rather discuss something 
else -- his talent for languages, artwork or cooking. A man is more than his 
memory, no matter how good it is. 
</P>
<P>
"Thirty years from now, I want to see myself as well-rounded. I want to learn 
more languages, to learn musical instruments, to become as accomplished as 
possible. One way to grow as a human being is to develop your potential and 
expand mentally, then to help others develop as well." 
</P>
<P>
After 67 interviews in 56 days, he is tired of performing, tired of being asked 
if he could memorize a phone book as Dustin Hoffman did in "Rain Man," tired of 
explaining that he is not an idiot savant. 
</P>
<P>
Rajan's growing celebrity is evident as he lopes along the wooded paths of the 
campus, a solitary figure deep in thought, reed-thin with dark eyes darting 
restlessly beneath inky curls. He shrugs off his reverie and responds jovially 
each time a student approaches to comment on this TV appearance or that 
magazine article. 
</P>
<P>
He chose Kansas State for its psychology department as well as its generous 
financial aid, never imagining how lonely -- how incongruous -- he might feel 
in a small town in Kansas, no matter how friendly the town. 
</P>
<P>
"There are far fewer distractions at KSU than at a UCLA or a Columbia," he said 
philosophically. But he never misses a chance to travel to bigger cities, and 
the distances are among the numbers locked in his memory: 1,361 miles to New 
York, 1,294 to Washington; 498 to Dallas; 114 to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
There are other foreign students at KSU, but most are men, and it isn't male 
company he longs for as he trudges back and forth between the campus and his 
bachelor apartment. He shares it with another Indian student, who is usually at 
his girlfriend's place. "I'm an incredibly lonely guy," Rajan said. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to tell at Fast Eddy's, the pool hall, where he seems to greet 
everyone. For 20 joyful minutes, he stretches gracefully over a table in the 
corner. His lanky arms send balls crashing as Dave Jenson watches approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
The regulars know all about Rajan's memory but "we try not to talk about it," 
said Jenson, the owner's son. "We take things in stride." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Rajan finds refuge with best friend Ruth Ridder, who feels a kinship 
based on her own British upbringing. Ruth, husband Tony and 3-year-old Hannah 
are "my American family," Rajan said. He and Ruth take turns cooking Indian 
meals in her kitchen, where his memory is as irrelevant as a trick knee. 
</P>
<P>
"He's funny, he's generous with his time and his finances. He's also 
unreliable, forgetful and annoying in lots of ways. . . . He forgets our phone 
number constantly," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
"When it comes to his memory, I'm in the what's-the-point category. I worry for 
him. He has a million acquaintances but he's lonely. Too many people try to 
make him a performing animal. We try not to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of himself, Rajan sometimes uses his memory to draw people to him. 
Once, he got a woman at a cafe to give him 57 random numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"He drank two cappuccinos, read Interview magazine from cover to cover and 
discussed the ill way we treat Nicaragua," Tony Ridder recalled. "Then, he 
repeated them to her. Backwards." 
</P>
<P>
Rajan admits to having hustled an occasional beer -- a beer he would barely 
touch -- but he said that is all in the past. These days, he confines his 
wizardry to the lab "so as not to contaminate the research." 
</P>
<P>

Tonight, it is his turn to cook, and he arrives at Ruth's laden with spices 
from an international market. He chases everyone into the living room, strips 
off his shirt and spends the next hour alone in the kitchen, shrouded in steam.

"I close my eyes, and I'm back at my mother's table eating supper," he said, 
lost in a memory not of numbers but of how it feels to belong.

PRISON JOURNALISTS CLASH OVER WHO WROTE WHAT

Wilbert Rideau and Billy Wayne Sinclair, convicted murderers with a bent for 
writing, won fame in the late 1970s and early '80s with articles in the 
Louisiana State Penitentiary magazine The Angolite. 
</P>
<P>
But the writings that concern them today include legal briefs filed in 
Sinclair's $100,000 federal lawsuit against Rideau, accusing him of plagiarism 
in a book he edited and of trying to damage Sinclair's journalistic reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything in this book was done properly," said Rideau, who still is editor 
of The Angolite. "I didn't claim to write anything I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither I, nor anyone else, has tried to damage Billy's journalistic 
reputation. He did that to himself back in 1986, when he became an undercover 
agent for the FBI while he was working as a journalist." 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair, 44, now jailed at the State Police Barracks in Baton Rouge, said that 
the lawsuit was a last resort. "The only thing I want is for the credit for my 
work to be protected and for Wilbert Rideau not to claim the things I did." 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair's death sentence for a 1965 murder during a bungled holdup was 
commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Louisiana's 
death penalty law. He left The Angolite in 1986 after going to the FBI when he 
was approached by a prison employee who tried to sell him a pardon. In the 
ensuing scandals, the head of the pardon board was sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
After he cooperated in the investigation, he was transferred out of Angola for 
his safety. He received a clemency recommendation from the pardon board, but 
Gov. Buddy Roemer, taking a hard line on crime, rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau, 47, has been at Angola since he was condemned to die for a 1961 bank 
robbery in which he killed a teller by slitting her throat. His sentence also 
was commuted to life when the death penalty law was thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair's lawsuit centers on a University of Southwestern Louisiana text, "The 
Wall Is Strong: Corrections in Louisiana," which Rideau edited with Burk 
Foster, a professor, and another Angolite editor, Ron Wikberg. The textbook is 
a compilation of newspaper and magazine articles and papers by the school's 
Center for Criminal Justice Research. About half is from The Angolite. 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair contends that four of the articles should have carried his byline. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau acknowledged that one should have. 
</P>
<P>
"He won the George Polk Award, the Silver Gavel Award from the American Bar 
Assn. in 1980 for 'A Prison Tragedy.' Leaving his name off it was an innocent 
mistake. Hell, my name was left off 'Sexual Jungle,' which I won the George 
Polk Award for. There are a lot of mistakes in the book. We had to put it 
together by phone and letters. It's not like we could take off and go to the 
printers every time we needed to." 
</P>
<P>
No matter who wrote them, Rideau said, ownership may belong to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prisoners. We were sent to prison to work and to suffer. Billy was 
sentenced to hard labor. He got a break and was sent to The Angolite, but he 
was paid for that work just as if he had gone anywhere else. Can the guy who 
makes license plates claim they're his? Can the prisoner who picks cotton go to 
the warden and tell him how to use that cotton?" 
</P>
<P>
The book is sold only at the university bookstore. At $26.95, it is not 
expected to make more than a few hundred dollars, Foster said. Even if it does 
make a profit, the money will go to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau said he gets nothing from it but satisfaction, tainted now by the suit, 
which he said reflects Sinclair's bitterness at being out of the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, The Angolite, which was a finalist for the Columbia School of 
Journalism 1989 National Magazine Award and, along with Barron's, received the 
American Bar Assn. award for journalism, has rebuilt its credibility, he said. 
"I have no war with Billy and I don't want one. I understand there has always 
been a certain resentment and jealousy on his part. It's sad when trying to be 
like someone turns to envy." 
</P>
<P>
Sinclair said he has no envy, just worry about protecting his work. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very close at one time. What Wilbert did for me when I was in jail was 
brought to the attention of a lot of people, and I'm very grateful. This has 
never been a personal vendetta on my part. He's the one that made it a 
vendetta. When I read that book, though, I realized the only way I can protect 
my work is to go to court."

PLEA TO DIM LIGHTS GETS GOOD RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The cry came from Palomar Observatory at the start of the decade: Turn down 
your lights! 
</P>
<P>
And by now they mostly have. 
</P>
<P>
The treasured astronomical finds being made from the world's most famous 
observatory were being jeopardized by Southern California's urban sprawl and 
the increasingly bright sea of street lights, illuminated billboards, parking 
lot lights and even front-yard landscaping lights pointing skyward. The problem 
did not exist atop Mt. Palomar when the observatory was under construction in 
the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The primary culprits were mercury vapor or incandescent lamps that were washing 
the sky with unwanted white light. Astronomers found that their light-gathering 
telescopes, trained on ultra-faint stars, galaxies and quasars in the far 
corners of the universe, were being poisoned by man's urban lighting. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1981, the astronomers at Caltech, which owns and operates the Palomar 
Observatory, mounted an intense public relations and political campaign to 
darken Southern California's night sky. 
</P>
<P>
They wanted outdoor light fixtures to be pointed downward. They asked that 
non-essential outdoor signs and billboards not be illuminated after midnight. 
And, most important, they wanted the state Department of Transportation, San 
Diego County and its various cities to convert their street and highway lights 
from the traditional white light to sodium light that -- while unpopular with 
some people because of its yellow hue -- is less offensive to the telescopes 
atop Mt. Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
The filters at the observatory can screen out the yellow light, while the 
low-pressure sodium bulbs effectively illuminate the same area. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, the various public bureaucracies, sympathetic to the nature of 
astronomical research and not wanting to render useless one of Southern 
California's greatest scientific tools, cooperatively fell in line to reduce 
light pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, they agreed that when the old lights burned out, they would be 
replaced with sodium units. New housing and commercial developments were 
required to install the yellow lights from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had excellent cooperation and results," said Robert Brucato, the 
observatory's assistant director. "If 
</P>
<P>
the controls hadn't been put in place by the various agencies, we'd be in very 
bad shape right now." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Thicksten, the observatory's superintendent, admits that the new-generation 
public lighting casts an eerie glow over San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I'll get up in the middle of the night to check on things and I'll 
do a double-take when I look to San Diego," he said. "The region is in an 
orange-ish glow, like a distant forest fire." TOM GORMAN

AS HOUSING TRACTS AND A UNIVERSITY REPLACE DAIRY FARM, CHICKEN RANCH AND 
NURSERIES, SAN MARCOS IS ON VERGE OF. . . ; 
</P>
<P>
TESTING ITS LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Ask the mayor of San Marcos where his burgeoning young town is headed, and he 
talks about getting his hands on a used monorail from Disneyland to link a new 
City Hall, now on the drawing board, and a new state university, also on the 
drawing boards. 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos, perhaps best known historically for its dairy farm, chicken ranch, 
rock quarry and wholesale nurseries, is quickly and clearly maturing. The town 
is like some skinny little country boy sprouting in his adolescence with signs 
of sophistication and brawn and a vision of what he's going to be when he grows 
up and moves off the farm. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been a city waiting to happen," says Mayor Lee Thibadeau, "and now, 
we're finally happening." 
</P>
<P>
If Thibadeau sounds like a rah-rah civic cheerleader, little wonder -- given 
where the city's been, and where it's going. 
</P>
<P>
When San Marcos incorporated in 1963, the first City Hall was upstairs from the 
mayor's barber shop -- plenty large enough during the first year of municipal 
autonomy to house the one and only city employee. The second -- and current -- 
City Hall is a modular orary building that previously was used as an Escondido 
bank office. 
</P>
<P>
Even today there is no downtown, no shopping mall and no movie theater -- and, 
some say, no clear civic identity. The community center is known, simply and 
appropriately, as The Barn, and that kind of says it all. 
</P>
<P>
Hodgepodge development during the 1970s saw generally small and unspectacular 
housing tracts and apartment developments, strip commercial development and 
mom-and-pop manufacturing and industrial businesses housed in metal-sided 
buildings alongside California 78, which runs through the middle of town like 
an unwanted varicose vein. 
</P>
<P>
But as other communities filled up, the outside world discovered San Marcos. 
Today it explodes with growth and development that gets Chamber of Commerce 
officials and real estate agents giddy. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, San Marcos was the fastest-growing city in San Diego County during the 
1980s, nearly doubling in population from 17,479 residents in 1980 to 33,835 
last January. That 93.6% population increase led North County's tumultuous 
growth in the '80s, which saw Carlsbad grow by 74.8%, Vista by 72.3% and 
Escondido by 53.8%. 
</P>
<P>
And San Marcos is just now finding its stride. 
</P>
<P>
* It is still only one-third developed, given a general plan that calls for an 
ultimate population of 110,000 residents. Just last year, the town's first 
master-planned residential community opened, and today there are plans at City 
Hall for thousands of new homes to be built during the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction of a civic center, with a City Hall, county library and 
community center, is scheduled to begin next summer on a 59-acre parcel at Twin 
Oaks Valley Road and San Marcos Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
* Construction is to begin in the spring for the Cal State San Marcos campus, 
the first new state university to be built in 25 years. Ultimately, the campus 
is expected to attract as many students as San Diego State University, which, 
with 35,500 students, is the system's largest and which spawned the San Marcos 
campus because of its own successful North County satellite center. 
</P>
<P>
* Having successfully developed a 60-acre retail warehouse center anchored by 
the Price Club, Home Club and Levitz Furniture -- a retail complex so rich with 
sales-tax revenue that it pays 15% of the city's operating costs -- the city 
now says it is ready for the ultimate stamp of successful suburbanhood: a 
shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
* The city already has spent more than $50 million in redevelopment funds 
during the past five years on a variety of public works improvements -- and 
plans to spend another $323 million during the next five years, mostly to 
improve streets and flood control in addition to paying for the new civic 
center. 
</P>
<P>
* City Hall staff members are working with local businesses in setting up 
employer-sponsored day care centers and in encouraging employers to implement 
staggered working hours to reduce peak-time traffic congestion in town. At the 
same time, the city has paid for the installation of computer terminals in the 
deputy sheriff's cars that patrol the city to reduce the amount of in-station 
paper work, and joined the city of Vista in paying for a Sheriff's Department 
street-level narcotics enforcement team to target drug traffickers working the 
two cities. 
</P>
<P>
* The city has endorsed the construction of a privately operated trash-burning 
power plant adjacent to a county garbage dump on the city's rural south side, 
arguing that the controversial project is environmentally and logistically more 
feasible than continued reliance on landfills. 
</P>
<P>
All this, in a community that grew by snores and yawns during its first 115 
years of existence. 
</P>
<P>
The first settler, Army Maj. Gustavus Merriam, came in 1875. He was a Civil War 
veteran who left his general store in Kansas in favor of this area's drier 
climate for the sake of his wife's tuberculosis. Merriam settled in the 
northern reaches of the Twin Oaks Valley, where he planted a sprawling 
vineyard, grazed cattle and raised bees. 
</P>
<P>
German immigrants who had settled in Olivenhain, to the south of San Marcos, 
worked for Merriam and many moved into the valley. 
</P>
<P>
By 1890, with expectations of the railroad coming through the small settlement 
out of Oceanside, a general store, a blacksmith and a hotel opened as the 
town's first commercial cluster. The train took a slightly different route, 
however, and the would-be downtown found itself sidestepped by several blocks. 
New businesses opened along the railroad and from that time on, San Marcos 
never knew where its downtown was. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a land company mapped out the town for parcel sales, the place was 
slow taking off, mostly because the ground-water supply was poor and there was 
no imported water. By the mid-1950s, with the population only around a couple 
thousand, two of the largest businesses in town were the Hollandia Dairy and 
the Prohoroff Poultry Farm, whose 2 million chickens made it one of the 
nation's largest egg suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
By 1960, piped-in water from the Colorado River arrived in San Marcos, and the 
population jumped to nearly 10,000 -- a fivefold increase over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, while Escondido to the east and Vista to the west began annexing 
towards one another, San Marcos in the middle decided to incorporate out of 
self defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Escondido had a shortage of industrial and commercial land and they thought 
the property along the railroad tracks in our direction would be an appropriate 
playground for them to latch onto," said Bill Bulow, a barber who was elected 
the city's first mayor when San Marcos incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
But the city had an abysmal tax base, and public works improvements were 
virtually non-existent as the city began to grow around existing, narrow 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, City Hall welcomed any and all development to help subsidize the 
cost of operating a city, and low-end housing developments, attracted by 
relatively cheap land, thrived. But the community soon backed itself into a 
corner: the growth outstripped the city's ability to handle sewage, and a 
building moratorium was ordered. When the moratorium was lifted in 1978, the 
country was in a recession. In 1983, when the economy improved, builders 
returned to San Marcos and the city, wanting to limit its growth, issued only a 
handful of new construction permits every three months. Builders literally 
camped in front of City Hall for the right to build even 10 or 15 houses or 
apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
That building limitation plan backfired. 
</P>
<P>
"The larger developers, who needed 100 or more units for their projects to 
pencil out so they could pay for parks and other amenities, couldn't get the 
permits they needed from us," said City Manager Rick Gittings. "They stopped 
dealing with us and went elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the city played host to small-time developers building a few units 
here and there, but not contributing to the cost of widened streets, new parks 
or other community amenities. 
</P>
<P>
The building protocol in San Marcos was again amended: today, a developer can 
build as many homes as local zoning laws permit -- as long as he pays for the 
streets, parks, schools and police and fire protection needed to serve the new 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
The first builder to take the city up on its offer was the Baldwin Co., which 
is building 1,550 single-family homes near Palomar Community College. Project 
manager Cindy Shaffer estimates that each homeowner will pay between $1,700 and 
$2,000 a year in fees for up to 30 years to finance, among other things, a new 
community park, an elementary school, a fire station and the added cost of 
police protection required by the new residents. 
</P>
<P>
"San Marcos is supportive of development as long as it pays its fair share for 
the necessary public facilities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Added Bill Snow, another developer who has worked in San Marcos: "It's easier 
to build in San Marcos than elsewhere. They're tough, but they're fair. You 
know what they want of you when you go in. When you're dealing with them, it's 
a level playing field with no funny bounces." 
</P>
<P>
The growth is bittersweet to long-time property owners, like Arie DeJong, whose 
family began the Hollandia Dairy in San Marcos in 1952. DeJong figures the 
1,000 cows now grazing alongside Mission Road will be relocated to the San 
Joaquin Valley within five years because maintaining 130 acres of grazing land 
in the middle of San Marcos is no longer financially feasible. 
</P>
<P>
The family is making plans with the city to turn the property into a 
master-planned residential, commercial and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we'll make a big profit," DeJong said. "We'll do very well. But I'll 
hate to see the bulldozers come in and tear the place down for housing 
development. I'll end up living in a nice home surrounded by other homes, and 
I'm not use to that. I'm use to living in a nice home surrounded by dairy 
cows." 
</P>
<P>
The city's future focal point is not dairy cows but the new university, which 
will be erected at the site of the one-time chicken ranch. 
</P>
<P>
The property was first purchased by developer Stephen Bieri in 1985, when he 
and his partners acquired 556 acres of land along the southern reaches of Twin 
Oaks Valley Road. 
</P>
<P>
Bieri's company planned a residential and commercial development there, but was 
persuaded by the city to sell 305 acres to the state for the campus after San 
Marcos beat out Carlsbad in spirited competition to host the 20th California 
State University campus. 
</P>
<P>
Bieri said he sold the land to the state at a loss, but figures to make up for 
it in the end while he develops the surrounding land with residential, 
commercial and business park uses. 
</P>
<P>
"San Marcos, with Palomar College and now the university, will be the 
educational hub of North County. In time, 40,000 to 50,000 students will be 
coming here," Bieri said. "That offers us some intriguing opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
The next step, Bieri said, is in determining which sorts of businesses to lure 
to his development. That will depend, he said, on the university's emerging 
character, and whether it becomes a high-tech engineering, computer science or 
bio-medical resource center, or a more traditional liberal arts and teaching 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Two hospitals -- Kaiser and Scripps Memorial -- already are considering 
building medical facilities in the university neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
The university hasn't made up its mind what academic direction to take, but its 
president, Bill Stacy, says it's clear in either case that the emerging 
town-and-gown partnership between the city and the school will benefit both. 
</P>
<P>
"Typical town-and-gown relationships are cordial at best, but usually the town 
doesn't want the university to interfere as a major player in the community," 
Stacy said. "But we hear San Marcos saying, 'We want you to be the essence of 
our city.' That's a wonderful start." 
</P>
<P>
Stacy and others say that, hard-core academia aside, the university is sure to 
provide an element of culture now missing in San Marcos, whether in theater, 
opera, music or art. 
</P>
<P>
Says Mayor Thibadeau, "The university is giving us an opportunity to develop a 
major focal point, something we don't now have." 
</P>
<P>
San Marcos will probably never have a downtown, Thibadeau said. Instead, 
officials talk of the "heart of the city," a long-range commercial, 
professional office and residential development plan that would be anchored, on 
the north, by the new City Hall and, on the south, by the new university 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
If Thibadeau has his way, the two would be linked by a monorail. The mayor 
wants to buy a piece of the existing Disneyland monorail system, which is being 
replaced by a newer one. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong with a people mover?" he asks. "Heck, people pay to ride them at 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
Is the idea a bit far-fetched? "Well, maybe that's an advantage of being a 
smaller town," he said. "We don't know any better."

CREW WORKING THE LATE SHIFT TO LAY NEW TRACKS ON SECTION OF COASTAL RAIL ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sound carries far in the cold, clear nights of winter, so many residents of 
northern San Diego County have awakened in the wee hours to ponder what all the 
noise is about. 
</P>
<P>
Not to worry. It's just a team of 210 workers replacing decades-old railway 
track with brand-new spans of steel along the 52-mile stretch of Santa Fe 
Railway from San Juan Capistrano to Sorrento Valley, south of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
The crew and about 70 machines work in the dark -- from about 9 p.m. until 4:30 
a.m. -- in a coordinated fashion that allows them to progress two or three 
miles by dawn and lets passenger trains keep their busy daytime schedules. 
</P>
<P>
The $45-million project will improve the ride and allow Amtrak trains to 
maintain their 90-m.p.h. speeds on the Los Angeles-to-San Diego run, the most 
profitable passenger corridor in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Martin, spokesman for Santa Fe, said the old track, laid in 1940-41, had 
deteriorated to a point where safety concerns dictated that new track be laid 
or train speeds be cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
The new rail sections are 1,440 feet long -- more than a quarter-mile -- and 
are welded into seamless spans. The rails are built in one piece and 
transported to the site by special train. 
</P>
<P>
The result may give nostalgia buffs a few pangs because the clickety-clack of 
the passing trains, produced when wheels strike unwelded joints of existing 
39-foot-long track sections, will go the way of the mournful steam whistle. 
</P>
<P>
The project began after Thanksgiving and was scheduled to be completed before 
Christmas. But because of delays caused by the weather and because equipment 
must be removed each morning and replaced at night, work is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
High-powered lights illuminate the work site, and the clang of mechanical 
hammers echoes through the night, silenced only by the dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the crew members are Navajos, long known as skilled track layers. 
</P>
<P>
As the crew moves south along the coastal bluffs and lagoons, they sometimes 
attract irate onlookers -- residents who apparently missed the announcements of 
the project published in local papers and are upset at the racket. 
</P>
<P>
Also inconvenienced by the project are Amtrak riders who take late-evening 
trains. The 8:45 p.m. trains from Los Angeles and San Diego turn into buses 
between San Diego and San Juan Capistrano, dropping off passengers at each 
train station along the way.

CLEANER AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After eight years of successful industry lobbying to block clean-air 
legislation in Washington, it is estimated that more than 100 million Americans 
in 100 cities breathe air considered unhealthy by the Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The growing evidence of the clean-air crisis and the burgeoning clean-air 
citizens' movement, however, has forced the clean-air issue to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has introduced clean-air legislation that has a chance of 
passing. Unfortunately, his bills fall critically short of what we need in 
order to to put an end to the unnecessary illnesses, premature deaths and 
environmental damage caused by air pollution each year. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, a far better solution has been crafted by a number of legislators. 
They call for a 50% cut in certain acid gas emissions in order to prevent acid 
rain. They call for a five-year deadline for most cities to reach the standards 
for urban smog. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in order to reduce toxic air pollution, they would require industries 
to adopt the use of best available pollution control technologies within three 
to five years and to eliminate cancer-causing air toxins within 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
These bills are the standard by which the President's bills should be judged. 
We urge our federal representatives, Jim Bates, Duncan hunter, Bill Lowery, Ron 
Packard, Pete Wilson and Alan Cranston, to support the strongest possible 
legislation. We have delayed too long, and the problem is too severe for half 
measures. We need strong action to stop air pollution in its tracks and roll it 
back in order to restore the air quality that should be our natural right.

FLOATING JAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Local political leaders tell us they have no money for additional jails. 
Citizens complain about locating criminal detention facilities in their back 
yards, and the justice system grinds slowly to a halt because we have no 
courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
And all the while, former warships sit in mothballs in local harbors. How does 
that figure? 
</P>
<P>
As a former Marine Corps judge advocate, I know prisoners have been held in 
ship brigs for the last several years. The repair ship Jason, and the destroyer 
tenders Cape Code and Acadia have all housed prisoners waiting for 
court-martial. If it works for the military, why not the county? 
</P>
<P>
Why not rejuvenate these decaying vessels into beautiful memorials of San Diego 
naval history and use them as county jails? We can then take the space adjacent 
to the downtown courthouse that presently serves as the County Jail and build 
the courtrooms our judges need to ease the crunch on our justice system.

EL SEGUNDO BUILDING OWNER SHOWS THE WAY ON REFURBISHMENT EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: JOHN NISLEY HOPES HIS RESTORATION PROJECT IN THE OLD DOWNTOWN WILL 
ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO PRESERVE THE AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Nisley grew up in Palos Verdes Estates in a house designed by Cliff May, 
whose designs are frequently inspired by 19th-Century California adobe ranchos. 
</P>
<P>
Nisley later became an architectural buff, joining the Los Angeles Conservancy, 
which works to preserve vintage structures, and becoming a regular on tours of 
historic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, he bought a distinguished building of his own, the Gilbert store and 
apartment building on Richmond Street in El Segundo's historic old downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Now, several years and half a million dollars later, Nisley is proudly showing 
visitors around his restored architectural gem and hoping to encourage others 
to refurbish the area. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good brick building, and it was an opportunity to do something 
myself," said Nisley, an El Segundo resident and real estate investor. 
</P>
<P>
The Gilbert building was his first investment. He said he paid members of the 
Gilbert family $96,000 for the five-lot property. 
</P>
<P>
When the two-story brick building with its distinctive wooden balcony went up 
in 1919, Richmond between Grand Avenue and El Segundo Boulevard was the town's 
main business street. El Segundo was in its infancy, born a company town in 
1911 when what is now Chevron USA Inc. located its second oil refinery there. 
</P>
<P>
There were later additions to the building, and by the time Nisley bought it, 
it needed extensive work. He spent several years doing much of that work 
himself, including constructing a large white-lattice back porch with stairs 
leading to the second floor. The major restoration started in 1987, an 
elaborate project that included making the structure earthquake-safe, restoring 
the green-and-white balcony and the facade, and renovating upstairs apartments 
with such amenities as marble, fireplaces and decorative glass. 
</P>
<P>
Nisley said he hopes what he has done will spark a Richmond Street renaissance 
of restaurants and shops in buildings harking back to the days that have lent 
the name Old Town to this part of El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
"This used to be a crowded city street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, historical pictures and accounts depict a street filled with 
pedestrians and automobiles, hotels, stores and a movie theater that still 
stands. City Hall was once at the corner of Richmond and Franklin Avenue, now a 
vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
A few other Richmond buildings have been spruced up in recent years, and some 
merchants say the retail climate is on the upswing. But others say that 
Nisley's dream is threatened by economics and by the looming legal requirement 
that unreinforced brick and masonry buildings be made earthquake-safe or 
demolished. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach engineer Melvyn Green, who did the earthquake work on the 
Gilbert building, said reinforcement costs on such structures range between $10 
and $15 a square foot. 
</P>
<P>
He said earthquake-safety requirements, aimed at saving lives, could kill off 
old El Segundo buildings because owners "who look at the bottom line and don't 
think of the buildings themselves" will probably choose to demolish them. 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo is working on such an ordinance, according to the city. 
</P>
<P>
A draft of the ordinance -- which could be enacted within 90 days -- would give 
owners of unreinforced buildings up to 270 days after receiving an order from 
the city to submit plans for reinforcement or demolition. 
</P>
<P>
John Shelton, who owns seven buildings on Richmond between Franklin Avenue and 
El Segundo Boulevard, is not optimistic that preservation will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone likes old buildings, but no one wants to support them financially," 
Shelton said, adding that so many buildings have been lost to parking lots on 
the block that there is not a lot left to work with. 
</P>
<P>
Shelton did an extensive renovation job on a building that houses the Sally 
Jean's Mercantile gift shop, but he said that for economic reasons he would not 
spend the money to make that -- or any of his other buildings -- 
earthquake-safe. 
</P>
<P>
George Renfro, who owns the Old Town Music Hall theater on Richmond, said he 
would like to upgrade the 1920 building because of a sentimental attachment. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born in El Segundo, the same year the theater was built," said Renfro, 
who leases the building to operators who show vintage movies and present live 
concerts on a Wurlitzer theater organ. 
</P>
<P>
But he said a decision to reinforce the building will depend on costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Dollar-wise, you can't throw money at something that won't bring it back," he 
said, adding that he thinks earthquake requirements "definitely could scuttle" 
historic preservation on the street. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown El Segundo Inc., a city-funded nonprofit group striving for 
grass-roots revitalization of older business areas, hopes to give Richmond a 
little help by producing videos about the Gilbert building and the theater for 
the city's community access cable channel. The group also wants to start 
walking tours that would include Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
Nisley too will put some more of his time and money into the street. This year, 
he plans to build a Victorian-style retail and apartment structure immediately 
adjoining the Gilbert building on the north. He said a stucco house attached to 
the building on the south side will be converted into a restaurant with outdoor 
patio seating in the rear yard. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pessimism of others, Nisley thinks his hopes of restoring the 
street are not unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes someone to come in, make an investment, and get it started," he said.

PODESTA STEPS DOWN AT BANK OF SAN PEDRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prominent San Pedro businessman Steven G. Podesta has retired from the Bank of 
San Pedro board of directors, two months after public disclosures that 
regulators had criticized the bank for issuing him more than $1 million in 
loans that they described as substandard. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews Friday, bank President Lance Oak and board Chairman Pete Mandia 
said Podesta's decision to step down had nothing to do with the regulatory 
criticism, which prompted the longtime director to repay some of the loans that 
had been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
They said that, at age 75, Podesta, who is also a major shareholder in the 
bank, simply wanted a break. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing insidious about his retirement at this point in time," Mandia 
said. "He's a man who's 75 years old. He wants to retire." 
</P>
<P>
Oak said: "The only reason that we have is that he wanted to spend more time 
with his family and his other business interests. . . . He just decided that 
after the first of the year he was going to take it easy." 
</P>
<P>
Podesta, whose retirement became effective Dec. 26, could not be reached for 
comment, and Oak declined to specify what business interests he intends to 
pursue. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years Podesta has been involved in a variety of ventures, among them 
real estate development, a computer business, a helicopter service and a 
company that sells fuel additives. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Podesta and another bank director, Bill Moller, were co-owners of 
the Princess Louise, a cruise ship-turned-floating restaurant that was berthed 
in Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
They later sold the ship, but the new owner went bankrupt and the vessel was 
repossessed by the Bank of San Pedro, which had financed its purchase. The ship 
capsized in October at a local shipyard, where it remains half-submerged as 
bank officials figure out what to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Podesta and Moller also undertook other joint ventures. The two owned 
Podesta-Moller Associates, a real estate development company. And, in 1981, 
they acted in concert to acquire a controlling interest in the Bank of San 
Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Podesta has served on the board since that time, and has been chairman of its 
loan committee since 1982. He owns 14.4% of the bank's stock; together, he and 
Moller own 32% of the Bank of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his job as a bank director, Podesta also served as president of 
the bank's real estate development subsidiary, BSP Development Corp., for which 
Moller serves as chairman. But bank officials said Friday that, with his 
retirement, Podesta has also given up that post. 
</P>
<P>
The bank announced Podesta's decision Thursday in an advertisement in the San 
Pedro News-Pilot. The ad, which took the form of a letter to bank shareholders, 
praised Podesta for "his many contributions in making the Bank of San Pedro the 
well-managed and profitable organization it is today." 
</P>
<P>
A state-chartered bank, the Bank of San Pedro is the only independent financial 
institution in the waterfront community. 
</P>
<P>
It was founded in 1975, and bank officials say it has grown significantly 
during Podesta's tenure, during which time its total assets increased from $32 
million to nearly $180 million. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, bank president Oak said Podesta has encouraged the bank to 
improve customer service and also to lend money to local businesses. "He was 
very concerned about putting money back into the community," Oak said. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual report to shareholders in October, the bank was required to 
disclose that it had come under criticism from federal regulators for issuing 
$1.04 million in six unsecured loans to Podesta. 
</P>
<P>
In interviews, bank officials said the loans were guaranteed by Podesta but 
issued to companies with which he is associated. For several months, four of 
the loans, totaling $479,000, were in default. Oak and Mandia have said that 
those loans have since been repaid and that the other two are current. 
</P>
<P>
Federal bank examiners cited the loans as apparent violations because they were 
substandard -- poor credit risks that could have deteriorated into losses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the shareholders' report noted that in July of last year, Podesta 
sold 29,996 of his bank shares to the bank's Employee Stock Ownership Plan for 
a total of $314,558, or $10.50 per share. Bank officials have declined to say 
whether Podesta used the money to repay the loans that had been criticized. 
</P>
<P>
Podesta's retirement -- coupled with the decision of former Director Thomas J. 
Jankovich not to seek reelection at the shareholders meeting this past October 
-- leaves the bank with just four directors, one short of the number required 
under its bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
Oak said the bank is now looking for another director -- "somebody that will 
uphold the standards that we require as a bank director and someone that can 
contribute and someone that is well-known in the community."

REFLECTIONS: 'FOR ME, SWIMMING IS LIKE DIVING INTO LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Golden Hill resident Barbara Van Dyken likes to think she can reach another 
plateau in the ocean. Van Dyken, 29, says she finds inner peace through 
rough-water swimming. The City College telecommunications student was swimming 
in the sea by the time she was 5. Her military family lived in several regions 
but always near the water. When her family moved to San Diego in 1976, Van 
Dyken joined the swim team at Mira Mesa High and lettered in the 200-meter 
butterfly. Though she no longer swims competitively, last summer she and a few 
friends founded the Aquazons, a group of women fond of swimming the often 
turbulent ocean. The small group usually swims on weekends. Van Dyken, who does 
a weekly show for the college radio station and works with junior-high 
students, was interviewed by Times Staff Writer Terry Rather and photographed 
by Barbara Martin Pinhero. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The ocean is always different when you go swim there. The conditions are always 
different, never the same. Sometimes it's calm, sometimes it's very, very 
rough. It's a totally different environment and very intense. 
</P>
<P>
The sounds, the smells . . . and visually, at every level it's stimulating, 
which is what I love. When you swim laps in a pool, you can look forward to it 
being the same thing every time. 
</P>
<P>
We decided to start the group last June. We had gone swimming and it was 
fabulous. We got started, and we didn't want to stop. And it's not just serious 
swimming, we like to have fun. We'll set a goal of where we want to swim to and 
back. When we swim, we all swim together. It's really important that everyone 
has a partner. The stronger ones can swim ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Coming back is the most difficult because the currents are against you. That's 
really what rough-water swimming is. Swimming against the currents, working 
your muscles. You don't necessarily fight the ocean, you work with it. You 
figure out how the water moves. 
</P>
<P>
I've been swimming since I was 5 or 6, both lap and ocean swimming. My parents 
told me that they'd take us down to the beach, and I'd go up to the water and 
tell the waves to stop so that I could get in. 
</P>
<P>
My family has always lived near the ocean. My parents used to take us to the 
Gulf of Mexico when we lived in Alabama. The gulf is very warm, beautiful and 
calm. We also spent some time on the Atlantic side. 
</P>
<P>
The water in Okinawa is beautiful and clear. The coral reefs are all kinds of 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
At times the ocean itself is like a mother or parent, while at the same time it 
may be dangerous. The lessons are there, and I'm here to learn. Part of my 
learning involves the ocean. Ultimately, swimming in the ocean is a way for me 
to get at the core of my humanity, finding out what it means to be human. I 
don't think everyone should try swimming to get in touch with themselves. But I 
do think everyone should try to find something like that that can help them in 
the same way. Ocean swimming is not for everyone, but it is for me. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose swimming in the ocean may seem to some really adventurous. Swimming 
in the ocean, you're put face to face with your mortality because you're in a 
situation that could be dangerous to your life. 
</P>
<P>
When you're in the water and paranoia overcomes you, and it does happen 
occasionally, you're forced to work through it and keep going. No matter what 
feeling overcomes you, whether it's paranoia or elation, you keep going. You 
also learn how to avoid potentially dangerous situations. You have to have an 
eye for that. It's not so dangerous if you know what to look for. 
</P>
<P>
I'm also a wimp. If it's really turbulent, lots of riptides, I won't get in. 
It's like, I don't want to be whipped, but I'll take a mild beating. But, by 
the same boat, I don't want to get hit lightly. It's nice to have a little 
resistance, to pull yourself through the water and have it resist you a bit. It 
makes you feel like you're working, really doing something. When I finish, I 
feel refreshed and like I really accomplished something. 
</P>
<P>
That's what is so nice about swimming in the ocean. You can concentrate and 
swim at any intensity you want. I think with swimming, the competition is 
within yourself. It begins with that and ends with that. 
</P>
<P>
For me, swimming is like diving into life. And that's how I want to live my 
life, diving in and looking forward to that swim, no matter what happens, and 
dealing with it when it happens. 
</P>
<P>
It's very applicable to my daily life, whether it's into my studies, or into 
work, or into personal problems. I just dive right in and look forward to the 
growth that happens as a result of that.

ARMED MAN'S ARREST ENDS NIGHTLONG STANDOFF 
</P>

An armed man who threatened a couple with a shotgun for several hours before 
releasing them unharmed was arrested early Saturday after a SWAT team stormed 
his Mission Hills apartment, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Wilcox, 60, was arrested about 7:30 a.m. on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon after the eight-hour standoff, said Sgt. Bob Knapp of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. He was being held on $7,000 bail at the Van Nuys 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began early Friday night when officers were called to the 
apartment complex in the 11600 block of Blucher Avenue to resolve a dispute 
between Wilcox and his female roommate, police said. The dispute continued, and 
officers were called out again about 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Police spent several hours trying to talk Wilcox into surrendering because they 
believed that he was holding the woman and an unidentified man at gunpoint, 
Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox allowed the woman to leave the apartment unharmed, then released the man 
several hours later, he said. Wilcox had "pointed the shotgun at both of them" 
during the incident, Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
A woman who identified herself only as Wilcox's roommate said she had argued 
with him before he barricaded himself in the two-story apartment by shoving 
furniture against the door, a neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Ray Banigan said he was allowed to remain in the complex until about 4 
a.m., when he and his wife were evacuated just before a Special Weapons and 
Tactics team stormed the residence. The SWAT team fired three rounds of tear 
gas into the apartment to flush Wilcox out. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox placed his shotgun outside the door and withdrew into his apartment 
shortly before the SWAT team broke down the door of his apartment, fearing that 
he had more weapons inside. No other weapons were found, however. 
</P>
<P>
Knapp said investigators have not determined why Wilcox barricaded himself in 
the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Wilcox moved into the apartment three months ago and did not indicate that he 
would have other renters, said Anna May, manager of the complex. Neighbors said 
Wilcox was retired and had a military background. 
</P>
<P>
On the door of Wilcox's apartment a sign reads: "There is nothing inside that 
is worth your life. This is protected by an armed guard."

S.D. WOMAN DIES IN FIERY CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 28-year-old San Diego woman was killed Saturday morning when her car struck a 
call box, overturned and burned. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Gonzales was driving 65 m.p.h. southbound on Interstate 15, just north 
of Highway 76, when she told her three passengers that she was turning off her 
headlights so she could drive faster without being seen by police, according to 
the county coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' car struck a call box on the right shoulder of the road, causing the 
car to overturn at 1:25 a.m. Gonzales, who lived in the 7200 block of Gatewood 
Lane, was thrown through the windshield and killed, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the passengers was taken to Palomar Hospital. Mark Sizemore, 23, of San 
Diego, is in stable condition, hospital officials said. The other passengers 
were Kathleen Agodt, 14, and Jadee Gonzales, 13, both of San Diego.

FOR PRESERVING PIERCE'S FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Calabasas Historical Society strongly urges the preservation of the Pierce 
College farm as a most valuable and significant historical landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Creative approaches which can be implemented immediately will result in 
increasing prosperity for the college. The preservation of the farm will 
benefit the entire community. Its citizens do feel they have a vested interest 
in seeing that the farm is maintained and improved as a living green area. 
Oxygen and food are essential for human life. Therefore, the Pierce College 
farm should be preserved for posterity, the heritage of the future, providing a 
variety of educational experiences for students of all ages.

FACTS ON GRAFFITI CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently you carried a story about a group placing City Council members Hal 
Bernson and Joy Picus on their "enemies" list for allegedly not cleaning up 
graffiti in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
That's just plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
As the past president of the Devonshire Division PALS, we worked closely with 
the council office on graffiti cleanup efforts. In fact, Councilman Bernson has 
even donated graffiti-cleanup equipment to the LAPD!

THREAT OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arco Solar Corp., the largest manufacturer of solar electricity in the world, 
has just been purchased by Siemens Corp., a West German company. 
</P>
<P>
Arco Solar maintains a branch in Camarillo which employs 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
This is just one more on a growing list of businesses being acquired by 
companies outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
British, West German and Canadian companies have all recognized the advantage 
of owning property in the United States, and they are investing heavily here. 
According to a recent TV report, approximately 50% of all high-rise buildings 
in Los Angeles are now owned by Japanese interests. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the staggering cost and scarcity of land in Japan, one can hardly 
blame the Japanese for seizing the opportunity to invest in valuable land at 
bargain prices; but when will Americans wake up to the fact that we are being 
bought out building by building and inch by inch? 
</P>
<P>
One public official who spoke out against the recent Camarillo sale was 
Congressman Elton Gallegly. Where were all the others? 
</P>
<P>
Have we, in this country, become so apathetic that we will sit by, without 
protest, while our country is gobbled up by outside interests?

DELIVERING THE NEW YEAR BABY

To use such a precious gift as birth and turn it into a trivial contest of

the parents of newborn Myra Palmer.

Dr. Turner stated "I knew God had a hand in it." If God had a hand in it he

SPRINKLER SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I certainly agree with your editorial (Dec. 24) about mandatory sprinkler 
systems for homes, but before this can be done, the installation cost must be 
reduced and the insurance companies made to provide the reduced rate you seem 
to think exists. An estimate I received recently for a new home put the price 
of sprinklers over twice what you estimated. I have yet to find an insurance 
company that gives a reduced rate for sprinklers in a home.

UCI BIRTHING CENTER PLAN WORTHY OF STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal by UCI Medical Center to open an off-site birthing center to relieve 
overcrowding in the hospital's maternity unit deserves careful consideration 
when state Medi-Cal officials meet with hospital administrators this week to 
discuss the issue. Properly planned, such centers have proven successful in 
other areas of the nation as an alternative to hospital births. And well-run 
birthing centers have one important side benefit: only women who are 
pre-screened and found to be low risk are allowed to deliver babies there. It 
thus could ensure something sorely needed by many in Orange County: proper 
prenatal care. As of now, many indigent women see a doctor for the first time 
when they arrive at an emergency room in labor. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan should be carefully scrutinized by medical specialists and 
advocates for the poor to make sure it never becomes a dumping ground for 
indigent women or further drives the medical system into a two-tier system for 
the poor and the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Medi-Cal reimbursement rates for privately run birthing centers fall 
short of what is needed. But there is great interest in Sacramento in UC 
Irvine's proposal, which would establish the first such publicly funded center 
in California. Estimates are that births at such centers may cost half as much 
as those in hospitals because of shorter stays by patients and because the 
centers are usually staffed by midwives instead of doctors. UCIMC is also 
asking Orange County to earmark up to $2 million in new tobacco-tax monies for 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
There is no reason why a well-run birthing center should not be an alternative 
for women of all economic classes. A study recently published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine stated that "few innovations in health service 
promise lower cost, greater availability and a higher degree of satisfaction 
with a comparable degree of safety" than birthing centers. The study followed 
more than 11,000 women at 84 birthing centers. Death rates were similar to 
those of low-risk hospital births; to ensure safety, birthing centers provide 
for transfers to hospitals in case of emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Only about a quarter of the women who used the centers were poor; the rest 
chose them because they were more convenient or they otherwise preferred them 
to hospitals. This is as it should be.

A WITNESS TO THE PANAMA INVASION: FEAR AND PRIDE LIVED SIDE BY SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GINA MARIE LICHACZ, Gina Marie Lichacz of Newport Beach was in Panama to 
visit relatives and to do research for her political science thesis at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What has traditionally been a silent, holy night -- the early hours of 
Christmas morning -- was this year a night filled with the sounds of AC-130s 
(Spectras), fighter planes and helicopters flying all over Panama City and the 
American military bases. 
</P>
<P>
Although there wasn't as much shooting that night as the previous nights, the 
mood and spirit of Christmas was different. Midnight Mass had been canceled. 
Only two days earlier, the church, a quarter-mile from the house at Albrook Air 
Force Station where we were staying, had taken a hit. Albrook was completely 
dark; even the antique lampposts in the streets had been destroyed for our 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas this year, when my family and I were visiting Panama, was a time for 
anticipation, thanksgiving and hope. I had never been so proud to be an 
American and to have witnessed such an event, even though our lives were at 
serious risk. The execution of the mission was superb, and our soldiers handled 
the operation with precision. Most importantly, I was overwhelmed with joy to 
see the happiness that filled the Panamanian people's hearts, knowing that the 
threat, power and rule of former dictator Manuel Noriega finally was over. 
</P>
<P>
The memories of excitement and yet horror of that early morning of Dec. 20 are 
so vivid in my mind that I still feel anxiety and fear. I wondered then if I 
would ever live to tell of the traumatic event. 
</P>
<P>
I was in bed, not yet asleep, when I heard several gunshots at approximately 
midnight. I ran into my parents' bedroom in our friend's house and found them 
asleep. I figured that the gunshots might have been my imagination, since I had 
been told earlier that evening that something might happen. 
</P>
<P>
On our trip to Panama only a few days earlier, a military officer warned me 
that "once an American gets killed by Noriega's men, the United States will 
have reason to intervene." In fact, the morning after the Marine officer had 
been killed, I was shocked to see around 30 or 40 troops in front of the 
military base church while Mass was being said. One could feel the tension in 
the air, and it seemed inevitable that "something" was going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
Around 12:45 a.m., I knew it wasn't my imagination. All I could hear was boom, 
boom, boom. At first I was excited, singing and jumping for joy, because I knew 
that this was what the Panamanian people had prayed for for so long. Being part 
Panamanian, I could understand the hopes for a new beginning that could now be 
within reach for Panamanians. The thought of bringing back democracy to Panama, 
where people could live a life different from the one they had been forced to 
live for the past 21 years, was exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
Filled with all this excitement, I at first ignored the fact that that my life 
was in danger. I naively felt as though I was an outsider looking into a glass 
bubble where I could see endless tracers flying through the sky about a third 
of a mile from the house. The explosions of buildings, including the Transcito 
(a building used by the Panama Defense Forces), lighted the sky like fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
We ran downstairs to the outside carport beneath the house to get a better 
glimpse. The house was within 100 yards of the Albrook flight line. We were 
there for only a few minutes when a combat-ready soldier ran by and ordered us 
to get back into the house and stay low. After we went back upstairs, our 
friend, a priest, with whom we were staying, told us: "I have already asked the 
Lord to forgive all your sins." 
</P>
<P>
It was the combination of these two incidents that made me realize that there 
wasn't a "glass bubble" separating us from the invasion. Suddenly, I was 
shocked, imagining the possible consequences of this event and at the same time 
having flashbacks of my life. I felt like I was living a horrible nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
As the next days went by, we avoided windows and doors, kept almost all the 
lights out and practically crawled everywhere. It was also virtually impossible 
to sleep at any time because of the anxiety. By Friday morning, we felt it was 
safe enough to take a peek outside and get some fresh air. When we heard 
automatic gunfire echoing around us, we realized we had experienced a false 
sense of security. Several troops ran by and asked us to go upstairs and keep 
low. We then heard mortars exploding; our troops were retaliating against and 
neutralizing some snipers. 
</P>
<P>
Later that day we found out that an American-dependent wife had been killed 
several doors down from our house. The only time our family really ever got out 
of the house, until we came back to the United States, we saw armored carriers 
and vehicles driving all around Albrook Air Force Station. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure that many people question the necessity of this invasion. I honestly 
think it was Panama's last hope. When we first arrived, I have to admit that 
the environment had changed drastically since our family's last visit only 
three years earlier. As we drove from Howard Air Base to Albrook, I saw areas 
that once were controlled by the U.S. military, including the "Ferrocarril" (a 
railroad station), Balboa and perimeters of the American bases, practically in 
ruins. When our family was stationed in Panama in the late 1970s, I remembered 
all these areas as being in immaculate condition. 
</P>
<P>
I felt sadness in my heart to see how this country, which once was so beautiful 
and full of life, now was going downhill. Most, if not all, Panamanians blame 
this on one person -- Noriega -- and the corruption of his reign. 
</P>
<P>
The attitudes of the Panamanians had also changed. It is alleged that, in the 
past, people who opposed Noriega mysteriously disappeared. Of those, many were 
threatened, tortured and killed by his men. This intimidation led to the 
oppression of the people. Within the past several months, a few of my relatives 
in Panama were threatened and detained for no apparent reason. I am grateful to 
be able to say that they are safe and doing well now. 
</P>
<P>
However, with the continuous oppression of the Panamanians and endangerment of 
American lives, something had to be done. It is important to note that once the 
invasion took place, the vast majority of Panamanians not only praised our 
soldiers for being there, but also helped identify which Panamanians were 
"pro-Noriega" and which weren't. 
</P>
<P>
Even now when I look back on this historic event, the images are still fresh in 
my mind. In fact, when I arrived at Kelly Air Force Base on our return to the 
States, and even since I have been back home in Orange County, it has been hard 
to sleep peacefully at night. The planes I heard flying out of Kelly and even 
now those from John Wayne Airport remind me of the same AC-130s, fighter planes 
and helicopters back in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
But, regardless of the anxiety I still encounter, I am thankful to have been 
able to witness the U.S. invasion of Panama and to have returned safely. 
Although the Panamanians didn't have a "silent night" this Christmas, they had 
much to rejoice about. They received the greatest gift of all -- the end of a 
dictator's reign and corruption and the return of democracy to Panama.

NEW YEAR'S GUNFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I couldn't believe my ears on New Year's Eve. I thought I was in Panama or 
Beirut. Every New Year's Eve it gets worse and worse. 
</P>
<P>
I have never heard such a cacophony of small arms, pistols, assault rifles, 
AK-47s and Uzis. 
</P>
<P>
And all this just two blocks from the Santa Ana police station on Ross Street. 
And not just at midnight, but from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. Some must have been 
celebrating New Year's for Arizona and then Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
It goes like this. First a poor dude gets out there with his six-shooter and 
fires off a quick six. Everybody counts. Then the guys with the larger caliber 
pistols say, "Watch this," and fire off a quick six. The the guy with the 
assault rifle says, "I can beat that," and fires off a quick 10 rounds. Then 
the guy with the AK-47 says, "I can beat that," and fires off a quick 15. Then 
the impatient Uzi owner beats everyone with his awesome firepower. 
</P>
<P>
I heard police sirens, but it becomes a cat-and-mouse game. While the police 
are in one section of the neighborhood, the hooligans fire from a block away. 
The police move out, and the clowns come out and fire into the air again. The 
police go back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Ana City Council is the most permissive City Council we have ever 
had. They allow all sorts of evil to go on in this city. If the machine-gun and 
small-arms fire on New Year's Eve had happened 20 years ago in the city, there 
would have been mass arrests. It would not have been tolerated.

PRO-CHOICE RALLY

<P>
Being a pro-choice advocate is not an easy job when you happen to be a male. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, I attended another pro-choice rally, this time at a Fullerton clinic. 
</P>
<P>
As I stood there with my buttons and sign, I listened to the women around me 
talking to each other. The conversations were full of derogatory statements 
about men. Now don't get me wrong, women are justified in having many ill 
feelings about men for the oppressions they've suffered through the ages. 
</P>
<P>
But I think the women in the pro-choice movement should try and be more aware 
of the men who are standing side-by-side with them on this issue, not to 
mention putting their bodies on the line for women's rights for reproductive 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure that most would agree that the pro-choice movement would attract more 
men if men felt more welcomed. Also, I'm sure that more men in the movement 
would surely be a benefit.

CLOSING THE DOORS OF SHARE OUR SELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who can I turn to when Share Our Selves isn't there? 
</P>
<P>
For at least seven years, I've come to this organization for food, gas, rent 
for O'Neill Park (when I lived in my car) and motel rent when I was car-less 
and homeless with a young son. 
</P>
<P>
When my young granddaughter got spinal meningitis, it was SOS that paid for the 
expensive antibiotic follow-up medicine. She is 3 and healthy now. My son and I 
received dental care. 
</P>
<P>
The groceries were a constant. Every week you knew you'd get the cheese, beans 
and powdered milk to keep young bones and teeth growing right as a supplement 
the times the food stamps ran out. 
</P>
<P>
But more than nutrition, medical and dental care was the heart care. When I 
needed a home for battered women, I was given a shoulder to cry on and directed 
to a motel until I could find a shelter. If I'd returned to the battering 
partner, I could have died. I owe SOS my life. 
</P>
<P>
When I lost custody of my son, I became an alcoholic bag lady rummaging in 
dumpsters and sleeping in parks. I didn't want to live and tried suicide. I 
came to SOS again for help. I was directed to Casa de Cerra, an alcohol 
rehabilitation home. 
</P>
<P>
I found my self-respect and self-esteem return enough to reclaim my son. He's 
11 now and I'm 52. We are struggling to find an apartment. Our HUD certificate 
is two months away, then we can leave grandmother's and he and I will re-enter 
the mainstream of society. I'm going to school to become a computer operator. 
</P>
<P>
We're almost out of the woods, but, ironically, the place that helped me the 
most will no longer be in existence after Jan. 15. It's incredible that an 
organization that has helped so many could close its doors. 
</P>
<P>
"Not in my neighborhood," the neighbors say. Did they say that to Jesus Christ 
when he helped the poor, lame, suffering people? Surely He aggravated some of 
the people who didn't want to be reminded that some of us are sicker than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
I've recovered and won't need even food help much longer, but some people never 
had a chance to go to high school and learn to read and write as I was 
privileged to do. Some people are not just economically disadvantaged. Some 
people have lost faith and have broken spirits. Alcohol and drugs dull and mask 
the pain of mere existence. 
</P>
<P>
Human beings sure don't live by bread alone. They also need kind words and love 
until they can love themselves again. Thank you, SOS.

CONTROVERSIAL DEVELOPMENT IN EAST ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Jerry Hicks' article (Dec. 31) on the petition drive in the city 
of Orange, it would appear that anyone who opposes the massive Irvine Co. 
development in the east Orange area is a person on the lunatic fringe. I want 
to contest that image. I have been an active participant in the review process 
for this project for the last two years through the Cowan Hills Homeowners 
Assn. and as vice president of the Rural Orange Coordinating Council. 
</P>
<P>
I spoke before the City Council once again on Dec. 12, the day the county 
approved the plan. At that time I said that, as a land-use planner and a person 
experienced in the review of development proposals, I do not believe that the 
canyons surrounding Irvine Lake and beyond can take the intensity of 
development that is proposed in this plan or that the traffic impacts can be 
mitigated. 
</P>
<P>
As for the statement in the article by Ted Botens and Bob Walters of the rural 
coordinating group that 11 homeowners groups have already supported this 
development, I truly question whether the homeowners themselves from these nine 
groups (which is all I counted on their signature pages) really know what their 
presidents signed for them in their behalf. And at least two of these nine 
presidents, Bill Earnest of Orange Hills and Joe Swain of Cowan Hills, were 
astute enough about the rules of their organization to sign as individuals 
only, and not for their boards or homeowners. What about the other seven 
groups? 
</P>
<P>
I do not wish to negate the work that was done on this agreement, and perhaps 
every board will eventually ratify it, but until that time, please don't 
attempt to wrap up all the homeowners on the east side in a neat little package 
to present to the Irvine Co. and to the city of Orange to guarantee the 
homeowners' silence. I just don't think you have the right to do that.

GIANTS SEEK TO ELIMINATE COSTLY ERRORS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: NEW YORK HAS BEEN ITS OWN WORST ENEMY IN ITS TWO MOST RECENT 
GAMES AGAINST THE RAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Championship teams rarely beat themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Turnovers, mistakes and penalties at the wrong time, they can have a 
tremendous determination on the outcome of each game," New York Giant Coach 
Bill Parcells said Wednesday. It's especially true of the Giants' two most 
recent games against the Los Angeles Rams, the Giants' opponent in Sunday's 
divisional playoff at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the Rams have an explosive offense that averages 377 yards a game, 
blending excellent receivers with a capable running game. The offensive line 
might be the best in football, and quarterback Jim Everett is one of the 
league's bright young stars. 
</P>
<P>
But the primary reasons for the Rams' 45-31 victory last season and their 31-10 
win in November have more to do with poor play by the Giants than the offensive 
might of the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the Rams' victory at Giants Stadium last season, 35 of their points were 
set up by Giants mistakes -- two fumbles and an interception deep in Giants 
territory and a special-teams breakdown that allowed a 44-yard kickoff return 
by Gaston Green that positioned the Rams for another score. For their first 
three scores, the Rams had to drive a total of 65 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Giants put themselves in a deep hole on Nov. 12 in Anaheim, when they 
gave up 14 points in a span of 14 seconds late in the second quarter. Wide 
receiver Aaron Cox was open for a 51-yard scoring pass from Everett because 
safety Myron Guyton slipped on the slick grass and couldn't provide deep 
coverage. Cox's TD made it 17-3 Rams, and it was 24-3 seconds later. David 
Meggett fumbled the ensuing kickoff at his 21-yard line and Everett made it 
hurt by throwing a TD pass to Flipper Anderson on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
Conclusion: Over the past two games, errors by the Giants have helped set up 49 
of the Rams' 76 points. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the mark of a good team when they take advantage of those things," Giant 
defensive coordinator Bill Belichick said. "They're a talented offense anyway, 
and when you give them a short field to work with, they only need a couple of 
first downs and they're in the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Everett said the Rams have been fortunate to get the breaks in their last two 
games with the Giants. "It's been one of those things that don't happen very 
much," he said. "I have a lot of respect for the Giants. They're a very sound 
group. If anything, we just got lucky on a few of those things. That's the way 
the game goes. I expect them to be very sound on Sunday, and I expect it to be 
a tough ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Lately, turnovers and mistakes haven't been a problem for the Giants. In fact, 
their ability to minimize them is a key reason why they finished the regular 
season with wins over the Denver Broncos, Dallas Cowboys and Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
In those three games, the Giants committed only one turnover, a Meggett fumble 
on a punt return against the Raiders. Phil Simms didn't throw an interception 
in that span, and the Giants have recovered four of the five balls they've 
dropped. This improvement came after a two-game stretch in which the Giants 
committed 10 turnovers, leading to 38 points by the San Francisco 49ers and the 
Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about his team's improved protection of the ball, Parcells said, "I 
told them if they kept fumbling, I was going to cut them." It's not clear 
whether he was joking. 
</P>
<P>
Bjorn Nittmo may not be a household name in the United States, but in his 
native land of Sweden, the New York Giants' place-kicker has become something 
of a national hero. 
</P>
<P>
Erik Hermans, sports editor of the New York-based Swedish News, compares the 
interest in Nittmo to Ingemar Johansson's knockout against Floyd Patterson and 
Bjorn Borg's ascension in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
"Nittmo is big news in Sweden," Hermans said Thursday. "All of the major papers 
have written something about him. He's probably one of the most famous people 
we have right now. The impression you get from the Swedish newspapers is that 
everybody in America is watching him." 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over the kicking duties when Raul Allegre was injured in Week 11, 
Nittmo has obliged a parade of Swedish reporters and camera crews who have 
documented his story. Nittmo got his initial chance in training camp last July 
when he showed enough potential to become a member of the six-man developmental 
squad at the start of the season. When Allegre pulled his groin during the 
Wednesday practice before the Seattle game Nov. 19, Nittmo was activated. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done about 10 to 15 interviews," Nittmo said. "It's always big news (in 
Sweden) when you make it over here in the States because the competition is so 
tough. Everybody thinks I'm a millionaire, though, but I'm not, not by a long 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Nittmo, 23, may or may not be the Giants' kicker in the divisional playoff game 
against the Rams Sunday. Allegre is eligible to be activated off injured 
reserve, and Coach Bill Parcells said he'll wait until Friday afternoon before 
deciding if he's going to make a switch. If the veteran Allegre gets the nod, 
Nittmo will likely be put on waivers or injured reserve and won't be eligible 
for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's going to happen," Nittmo said. "I'm just waiting like 
everybody else. But it would be nice to know, though." 
</P>
<P>
Nittmo has kicked well, making nine of 12 field-goal attempts, but he hasn't 
made one longer than 39 yards (he's missed two from 47) and hasn't had to 
attempt a game-deciding kick. 
</P>
<P>
If Parcells decides to use Allegre, Nittmo has no regrets. He's gotten a lot of 
exposure, including an appearance on "Late Night With David Letterman," where 
he was introduced as the only Bjorn Nittmo in the New Jersey telephone book. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been watching (Letterman) since I was in college," said Nittmo, who was 
on the show last Friday night. "It was pretty fun. I like his type of humor. 
It's sarcastic. To be playing six weeks and then top it off by being in the 
Letterman show, it's been something." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Lund, Sweden, Nittmo came to the United States as an exchange student 
attending Enterprise High School in Enterprise, Ala. The first football game he 
ever saw was the first one he played in. He later attended Appalachian State 
and married the athletic director's daughter. Their home is in Boone, N.C., 
hence Nittmo has more of a Southern accent than one that sounds Swedish. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter how long he's been away from Sweden," Hermans said. "He's a 
Scandinavian, and there aren't many of them over here in sports. Most are in 
the NHL. Scandinavians take a lot of pride in someone who does well here." 
</P>
<P>
With that, they have reason to take pride in Nittmo.

MACLEOD'S DECISION ONE OF KEYS TO KNICKS' SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HUBBARD, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editors of The Sporting News choose the NBA's executive of the year, and 
thus far, they have not asked for help. It's obvious, however, that there is 
only one choice: 
</P>
<P>
John MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, MacLeod is without a job, and he has never been an executive. But 
as far as Knick fans are concerned, he made a very important executive decision 
when he rejected Al Bianchi's overtures last summer. Bianchi wanted MacLeod, 
his good friend and boss in Phoenix for 12 seasons, to become the Knicks' head 
coach. MacLeod refused. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi then promoted Stu Jackson to head coach, and Jackson responded by 
putting the best Knick product on the floor since the Knicks' glory years in 
the early '70s. MacLeod, therefore, is largely responsible for the Knicks' 
success. And because he already has been fired by the Mavericks, MacLeod 
deserves some form of compensation. 
</P>
<P>
MacLeod's decision to not take the Knicks' job may be the smartest thing 
Bianchi has ever done. And although there has been much talk about Patrick 
Ewing's bid to become the first MVP from the Knicks since Willis Reed in 1970, 
it is important to remember that it is Jackson's system that has allowed Ewing 
to flourish. Perhaps it is time to begin focusing on Jackson as a potential 
award-winner. 
</P>
<P>
Ewing was capable of dominating last season. But he did what he was told, which 
was shoot about 16 times a game. During last season, Ewing attempted only 135 
more field goals than the Knicks attempted three-point shots. Ewing and the 
three-pointer were almost equal options. 
</P>
<P>
This season, however, Ewing has attempted 570 field goals -- about 20 per game 
-- and the Knicks have attempted 270 three-pointers. Ewing now is more than 
twice as important as the three-point shot. It's a question of focus, and the 
Knicks unquestionably are better focused than they were last season. 
</P>
<P>
For that, Jackson must receive credit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's early," Bianchi said, "but I think the things that we thought about him 
have come true. We knew he would be able to work with people, and he has. He's 
handled the Mark Jackson-Rod Strickland situation well. It is evident that 
Kenny Walker needed to be treated with tender loving care, and Stu's done that. 
And Patrick's playing better than he ever has because Stu has given him the 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
When the Knicks hired Jackson, then 33, it was suggested here that no rookie 
coach could win a championship. That was wrong. Jackson hasn't won it yet, but 
it seems obvious now that if he doesn't, it won't be because he's a rookie 
coach. Some team simply will play better than the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, Jackson will make his imprint on Knick history. The Knicks' 
nine-game winning streak ended Tuesday when they lost to the Suns, which gave 
the Knicks a 20-8 record. If they continue winning at their present pace, they 
will end the season 59-23. Only the 1969-70 Knicks championship team (60-22) 
had a better record. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson also could become the third Knick coach -- Joe Lapchick and Red Holzman 
are the others -- to coach in the All-Star Game. If the Knicks have the best 
record in the East on Jan. 28, Jackson will be the Eastern coach, and benefit 
from the accompanying publicity. 
</P>
<P>
And perhaps at some point he will thank MacLeod, because by not coming to New 
York, MacLeod has enabled Jackson to become perhaps the No. 1 contender for the 
coach of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic may be an expansion team, but their clock crew apparently is familiar 
with some old tricks. In the Pistons' 115-113 victory in Orlando Tuesday, Magic 
guard Nick Anderson missed a free throw with 2.7 seconds left. Dennis Rodman 
got the rebound, turned to his left and attempted to throw the ball to the 
other end of the court. Anderson, however, intercepted the pass and launched a 
desperation 40-foot, three-point shot. The problem, as the Pistons saw it, was 
that when Anderson attempted the last shot, 2.2 seconds were left on the clock. 
"Dangerous," Coach Chuck Daly said. "I'm not sure the clock started." 
</P>
<P>
"The clock didn't even move," Bill Laimbeer said. "There's no excuse for that. 
It's bad for the NBA when stuff like that happens." 
</P>
<P>
OK, Bill. You want to talk about what's bad for the NBA? The first release of 
Eastern Conference All-Star voting totals has Laimbeer trailing Ewing by only 
363 votes in balloting for the starting center position. Not only that, but 
Mark Aguirre is second among forwards. Obviously there have been a lot of votes 
submitted from Detroit, where the fans are very loyal but not real bright. How 
could anyone vote for Laimbeer instead of Ewing, no matter where they are from? 
Anyway, Ewing will win when the votes from some of the more intelligent fans 
around the league are counted. 
</P>
<P>
So far, various experts have credited the Spurs' turnaround to David Robinson, 
Larry Brown and-or Terry Cummings. Now former Spur Greg Anderson, who was 
traded to Milwaukee with Alvin Robertson for Cummings, says Maurice Cheeks is 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"When Alvin and I were there, they never really had a point guard," Anderson 
said. "They always had a 2-guard they tried to use as a point. That makes it 
hard. Maurice is the difference for them." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, of course, was reluctant to credit Cummings. "I think if Alvin and I 
were there, things would be about the same," Anderson sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone interested in wasting money and time should immediately call 
1-900-872-6847. For he rather lofty price of $1.49 a minute, you can hear the 
hotline of Hornet guard Tyrone "Muggsy" Bogues -- "You know me," the tape 
begins, "smallest guy in the NBA." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, the hotline featured Muggsy talking about upcoming Hornets games, 
taking a look at the NBA, some personal information, why things are going the 
Hornets' way (?), whether Hornets fans should boo Kelly Tripucka, Muggsy's 
reaction to Hornet GM Carl Scheer, who said the Hornets were "weak and limited" 
at point guard, and information on a free trip to Hawaii. But a personal 
favorite was the revelation by the 5-3 Bogues that the toughest guy in the NBA 
for him to guard is 6-9 Magic Johnson. Thank you, Muggsy. That was money well 
spent. And, by the way, for those who can't remember the number, simply dial 
1-900-USA-MUGS. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from Miami indicate that in a recent game, Park Avenue Pat Cummings, 
the former Knick, completed a behind-the-back pass to a teammate for a layup. 
That sounds about as appealing to watch as Refrigerator Perry attempting a 
leaping high-five. 
</P>
<P>
Magic guard Scott Skiles was a little dubious when a young fan recently 
approached and asked Skiles to autograph a Scott Skiles poster. Skiles being 
Skiles, he knew he didn't have a poster. The kid produced a poster of Michael 
Jordan, who was dunking over a helpless Skiles. Skiles laughed and autographed 
the poster. "I should have asked for royalties," he said.

TURLEY LEFT GAME FAR BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN STEADMAN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MARCO ISLAND, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Professional athletes too often become lost causes outside their own world of 
fun and games. Hand them The Sporting News, not The Wall Street Journal. Give 
them a box score instead of a stock table. 
</P>
<P>
An extraordinary exception is Robert Lee Turley, the fabled "Bullet Bob," a man 
of sterling pitching accomplishments who won the Baltimore Orioles' first 
American League game after the franchise was restored in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
Turley is an almost make-believe success story . . . except it's all true. He 
doesn't allude to it, but he may be the wealthiest retired baseball player in 
America. What Turley and his wife, Carolyn, have created as their private 
residence in this southwest Florida resort community is an absolute 
spellbinding example of architectural splendor. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists clog the street, Copeland Drive, as they linger long enough to marvel 
and photograph "The House That Bob Built," which suggests by its massive 
appearance that it might be a museum, church or library. A conservative 
estimate of its cost is put in excess of $6 million, excluding furnishings and 
other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
This is not your typical getaway bungalow. Its size is overwhelming; the 
structure itself is breathtaking. There are five levels, 37,000 square feet of 
space, five bedrooms, 6 1/2 baths, four kitchens, a formal living room, 
library, music room, billiard room, dining room, and a 52-foot square 
cathedral-like entrance hall with 10 columns. 
</P>
<P>
What is called the "great room" has a herringbone hardwood floor, a gold leaf 
ceiling that is dressed off with 6,000 pounds of plaster molding imported from 
England. There's also a 7-foot, 500-pound chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
The house is so huge (12 times the size of the average residence on Marco 
Island) that communications presented a problem, which was alleviated by the 
installation of an electronic intercom system, plus -- imagine this -- 31 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
This imposing monument to a grand lifestyle few Americans can identify with has 
been registered for perpetuity in a Turley family trust. There's even a time 
capsule for some future generation of Turleys to open for inspection so they'll 
be able to reflect upon the past, which is now the present. 
</P>
<P>
All of this magnificence is a credit to the perseverance, intelligence and 
stupendous salesmanship of Turley, whose achievements in business far surpass 
what he attained in baseball, even though he spent 12 years in the American 
League, pitched in five World Series with the New York Yankees and in 1958 won 
21, lost 5 and earned the Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
Turley was born to a family of modest circumstances in Troy, Ill. His father 
worked at a packing house and frankly told his son he couldn't afford to send 
him to college. So Bob put his pitching talents on display for the St. Louis 
Browns at Sportsman's Park. A coach named Joe Schultz, who warmed him up, was 
visibly impressed. 
</P>
<P>
He was a bargain find, costing the Browns a mere bonus of $200 and a contract 
for $600 a month, or a total of $1,200, with their Belleville farm club of the 
Illinois State League in 1948. He had a million-dollar arm but never made more 
than $35,000 in a career that included service with the Browns, Orioles, 
Yankees, Boston Red Sox and California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Now Turley, as one of the chief executives of the A.L. Williams Insurance Co., 
doesn't need to worry about salary negotiations or trying to convince 
management he's worth more than it wants to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball, at this stage, seems little more than a passing chapter in his life 
as he looks out from a balcony toward scenic Roberts Bay, where at the edge of 
his three-acre property is a dock and two Turley-owned boats, one named 
"Nonsense," a yacht that sleeps eight, and the other plain "Common Sense." 
</P>
<P>
At the Marco Island Airport, there's a private plane, a Citation Jet, 
accommodating six passengers, and a pilot awaiting his command. Affluence wears 
well with Turley. He is friendly and enthusiastic, sincere and still boyish at 
age 59, even if his career zoomed off into the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
He smiled as he pointed to a row of royal palm trees and said, "They cost more 
to buy and transplant than what I made my first year in the big leagues." Not a 
brag; just a factual statement of an impressive financial status. 
</P>
<P>
Bob recalls fondly his old baseball friendships, the likes of Mickey Mantle, 
Bill Skowron, Yogi Berra, Billy Hunter, Lou Sleater, Bob Nieman, Gus Triandos, 
Lou Grasmick and Irv Hall, who was his manager at Aberdeen in the Northern 
League when he put together a 23-5 campaign. Those personal associations make 
for pleasant memories. 
</P>
<P>
Turley's third wife, Carolyn, is a vibrant, artistic woman whose main interests 
include geriatric care, music and watercoloring. The architect of record for 
the Turley "castle" is John K. Dyehouse III of Naples (Florida, not Italy) but 
there's no doubt Mrs. Turley has put her imprint on the structure, furnishings 
and landscape. 
</P>
<P>
It might be defined as neo-classical in design, with strong Italian and English 
influence. It has sprawling European gardens, with statuary of marble and 
brass. They call it Casa Nel Sole, or "our house in the sun." 
</P>
<P>
There's a three-car garage, a swimming pool with a state-of-the-art purifying 
system and, instead of chlorine, hydrogen peroxide is added to the spa water 
for health reasons. The recreation area includes tennis and volleyball courts, 
horseshoe pits and a golf putting green, plus a pavilion for dressing and 
showering. 
</P>
<P>
"We've hoped to capture the grace of the European villas of the past and the 
comfort of Florida living in our home," explained Carolyn. "We wanted to adapt 
the neo-classicism of Italian villas and 18th century English houses to our own 
home plan." 
</P>
<P>
What the Turleys have produced here is an awesome tribute to diligence and 
business acumen. It's merely an accident that he was once a prominent baseball 
player -- an incredible contrast to the afternoon he agreed to accept a $200 
signing bonus and a salary of $600 a month for what remained of the 1948 
season.

<P>
Cypress College had a comfortable lead, then survived a couple of scares to 
defeat Golden West, 75-69, in an Orange Empire Conference basketball game 
Saturday at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
It was the 500th victory in the 24-year history of Cypress' program. Cypress 
has a record of 500-223. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers led at the half, 41-32, and increased their lead to 49-38 with 
about 15 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
But Golden West was able to cut the lead to 53-52 with 11:10 remaining despite 
playing only seven players because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers then went on a 9-0 run to lead, 62-52. 
</P>
<P>
"When were were up by 10 a second time I thought we were in pretty good shape," 
Cypress Coach Don Johnson said. "But we took some poor shots and didn't have 
the boards to back up the misses. When you're up by that many points you need 
to work to take better shots." 
</P>
<P>
Golden West, which outrebounded Cypress, 42-39, drew close again when Ric Van 
Scoyce made a three-pointer, was fouled, and made the free throw to complete a 
rare four-point play, and cut the lead to 62-56 with 6:18 left. Van Scoyce 
added another basket a minute later and the lead dwindled to 64-61. 
</P>
<P>
But Cypress' Vince Hizon made a layup, and teammate Brian Kenney twice made 
some impressive moves to the basket for open layups and Cypress led, 70-64, 
with two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
Hizon led Cypress (16-3 overall, 2-0 in conference play) with 20 points. Kenney 
and Eric Pauley each added 12 for Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West came into the game with a four-game winning streak but the Rustlers 
were without sophomore forward Kevin Andersen, who is averaging 13 points a 
game. He missed the game because of illness. Several Golden West players have 
been ill this week and Golden West Coach Jim Greenfield said he had only four 
players healthy enough to practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Center Alex Kreps replaced Andersen in the lineup, playing almost 38 minutes, 
including all of the second half. He finished with a team-high 19 points and 12 
rebounds. Craig Rice had 17 points and Van Scoyce had 14 for Golden West (14-7, 
1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Orange Coast 65, Fullerton 55 -- Alan Schlines scored 23 points and had 10 
rebounds to lead host Orange Coast (12-5, 1-1). Chip Hanlon added 14 points and 
seven rebounds for OCC, which broke a four-game losing streak. Darryl Griffith 
had 14 points and Roy Joseph 12 for Fullerton (8-10, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
Riverside College 104, Saddleback 83 -- Xavier Edison scored 22 points off the 
bench to lead visiting Riverside. Corey Cothrine also came off the bench to 
score 16 for the Tigers (12-9, 1-1). Charles Lockard led Saddleback (7-11, 0-2) 
with 29 points and seven rebounds.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COLLEGE RALLIES TO DEFEAT OCCIDENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California College won the Occidental College men's basketball 
tournament Saturday night by defeating the host team, 72-58. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing at halftime, 23-19, SCC scored the first six points of the second half 
to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
Center Jeff Bickmore had eight rebounds and led SCC (8-5) down the stretch, as 
17 of his 21 points came in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't playing within our offense in the first half," said Bickmore, a 
6-foot-7, 210-pound junior from Santa Ana. "We made that adjustment in the 
second half, and I got the shots I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Center Chris Anderson led Occidental (5-8) with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference men's basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Christ College Irvine 91, Fontbonne 85 -- Kevin Kurz had 24 points and Mike

McShan 10 for Christ College Irvine (8-10). 
</P>
<P>
In women's nonconference basketball: 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College 90, North Carolina Greensboro 55 -- Leading 19-15 four minutes 
into the game, host Chapman College went on a 17-0 run over the next four 
minutes en route to a 46-29 halftime lead and was never challenged. Forward 
Bethel Trice had 26 points to lead Chapman (11-3). Teammate Ruth Akahoshi added 
23, including 18 points on 6-for-12 shooting from three-point range. Greensboro 
(7-2) was led by forward Karen Jordan's 14 points. Center Jennifer Uecke had 16 
points and 13 rebounds for Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
At the UC Irvine swimming invitational: 
</P>
<P>
UC Irvine's Jeff Klatt won the 200-yard individual medley and teammate Dave 
Pohlmann won the the 500-yard freestyle in the first day of the swim meet at 
Irvine's Heritage Park. 
</P>
<P>
Klatt had a time of 1 minute, 59.48 seconds and Pohlmann had a time of 4:43.95. 
The Irvine men also won the 400 medley relay in 3:34.67. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's division, Irvine's Danielle Pajer (1:10.43) was second in the 
100 breaststroke behind Cal State Long Beach's Kelley Evans (1:09.62), and 
Irvine's Debbie Babashoff (5:13.95) was second in the 500 freestyle behind Long 
Beach's Lynnet Kosmala (5:11.68). Irvine was third in the 800 freestyle relay 
with a time of 8:13.66. 
</P>
<P>
In nonconference wrestling: 
</P>
<P>
Northern Iowa 20, Cal State Fullerton 15 -- Northern Iowa, the 10th-ranked team 
in the nation, defeated host Fullerton by winning five of the 10 matches and 
earning a tie in a sixth match. Fullerton is 3-5 and Northern Iowa 7-1. David 
Jones defeated Greg Berg, 15-8, in the heavyweight division for Fullerton.

LUNDQUIST, BRADSHAW ADVANCE TO POSTSEASON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The identity of the National Football League's conference finalists won't be 
known until late Sunday, but one competition in the playoffs is already 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
Verne Lundquist and Terry Bradshaw will be the CBS commentators at the 
Minnesota-San Francisco game Saturday, indicating they won the season-long 
battle among the network's crews to see which gets a playoff plum. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Summerall and John Madden handle four of the five postseason CBS telecasts, 
so there is little available for the other regular-season broadcast teams. 
</P>
<P>
Summerall and Madden will be at Giants Stadium Sunday for the Giants-Rams game, 
then will call the NFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl. CBS's "NFL Today" 
crew, headed by Brent Musburger, will cross the country to broadcast at both 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, which uses three different broadcast teams in the playoffs, will have 
Charlie Jones and Merlin Olsen in Cleveland for Saturday's Bills-Browns game. 
Jones and Olsen have developed into a comfortable team and, in view of the 
difficulties Bill Walsh has had in adjusting to a broadcast role, arguably 
constitute NBC's top unit. 
</P>
<P>
The Dick Enberg-Walsh pairing has Denver-Pittsburgh Sunday and is already 
assigned to the AFC Championship Game a week later. 
</P>
<P>
CBS plans to have an emergency generator at Candlestick Park in San Francisco 
for Saturday's game just in case there is another earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake that measured 7.1 on the Richter scale hit the San Francisco Bay 
Area Oct. 17, 31 minutes before the scheduled start of Game 3 of the World 
Series in Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
"If we lose power, we would have the ability to maintain our signal," CBS 
spokesman Tony Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
The Big East has made itself a basketball power by producing champions on the 
court and carefully structuring its television exposure. The poor teams don't 
show up on CBS or ESPN all that often. Regular-season productions are carefully 
manicured to put the best dunk forward. 
</P>
<P>
Consider Tuesday night's St. John's-Connecticut opener. Here were two teams 
with excellent records and high hopes, but even that wasn't enough if you 
listened carefully to the "set up" of the show. Sure, we expected the 11-2 
Redmen and the 10-2 Huskies to be presented in the best light. But wasn't it 
surprising that we were 10 minutes into the telecast before learning that 
Connecticut had already played -- and lost -- a Big East game? 
</P>
<P>
Such is what we've come to expect of league broadcasts that make certain 
conference image is cosmetically correct. Therefore, it wasn't surprising to 
listen to John Sanders and Ron Perry sing the praises of both clubs with hardly 
a word about UConn's difficult start against Villanova. 
</P>
<P>
Attention to the image is hardly unique to the Big East in an age when college 
sports polishes the apple non-stop. But that doesn't mean we have to like it. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut may suffer from the league's high profile simply because the 
Huskies haven't been able to establish themselves in the first division of the 
circuit. As a result they don't get the call from CBS, and their ESPN 
appearances are minimal in comparison with Georgetown and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
And when a 93-62 defeat can be passed off with the concluding phrase that 
"UConn will be back" by an analyst like Ron Perry, we might guess that the PR 
folks are running the show. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN is starting the process of re-organizing its schedules to accomodate 
conference college basketball this winter and to get ready for Major League 
Baseball next spring. 
</P>
<P>
Top Rank Boxing will occupy a Sunday night slot during the winter, then jump to 
Thursday nights April 5 when the baseball season begins.

HERSCHEL WALKER BECOMES MISSING MAN IN MINNESOTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
To lure him northward, the Minnesota Vikings gave Herschel Walker a mansion, 
lots of money and every assurance that the endorsement conglomerate he built in 
Dallas would play just as well on television sets and billboards across the 
frozen tundra. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen weeks later, it appears there was one significant omission. The 
football is one creature comfort Walker is learning to live without. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everybody is probably surprised," 49er linebacker Mike Walter said. 
"When the trade took place, it looked like they were planning on using him a 
lot, but they haven't. I kind of hope that doesn't change this week." 
</P>
<P>
As they devised a defensive strategy for Saturday's NFC playoff game, the 49ers 
didn't quite know what to make of the Vikings' decision to turn Walker into the 
NFL's most prominent decoy. 
</P>
<P>
They seem to have decided to shrug their shoulders and prepare for the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to be ready for what the man is capable of doing," 49er Coach 
George Seifert said. "We can't concern ourselves with what he's done or what he 
hasn't done." 
</P>
<P>
Said nose tackle Jim Burt: "We're preparing for him whether they give him the 
ball or not." 
</P>
<P>
Walker is the Vikings' leading rusher, but his 11-game numbers (169 carries, 
669 yards) are decidedly ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
He is averaging 60.8 yards per game despite a 148-yard performance against the 
Green Bay Packers in his Vikings debut Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
To take it a step further, eliminate that opening game and Walker is averaging 
52.1 yards per game, a figure that would have represented about an average half 
for him in 1988, when he gained 1,514 yards for Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Walker was shunted out of Dallas because he didn't fit into coach 
Jimmy Johnson's pass-oriented offense. 
</P>
<P>
Given that, it is interesting to note that Walker averaged 16.2 carries per 
game in five games with the Cowboys. In 11 games with Minnesota, he is 
averaging 15.3 carries per game. 
</P>
<P>
Walker the pass receiver has been almost nonexistent as well. He has caught 18 
passes for the Vikings after catching 22 as a Cowboy. 
</P>
<P>
"In order for Herschel to get a feel for a game, he's got to get the ball a 
lot," said 49er guard Guy McIntyre, who blocked for Walker at the University of 
Georgia. "Maybe they just don't have the patience to let him get started." 
</P>
<P>
The way the Vikings saw it, Walker came to Minnesota bearing two gifts: an 
instant running game and a trip to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota has perhaps the NFL's best defense and a passing game that features 
Anthony Carter, Hassan Jones and Steve Jordan. But its most glaring weakness 
was its running game. Darrin Nelson led the team a year ago with a paltry 380 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
When he traded five players and four high draft picks for Walker on Oct. 12, 
Viking General Manager Mike Lynn admitted the team mortgaged its future to get 
Walker. Lynn gave the fans carte blanche to label the trade a failure if the 
Vikings don't make the Super Bowl in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
The Super Bowl remains a possibility, but it's hard to measure Walker's 
contribution to the effort. An argument could be made that he has had his 
greatest impact with the Vikings as a kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
Walker returned one 93 yards for a touchdown and is averaging 28.8 yards on 13 
runbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Burt, who faced Walker twice a year while with the New York Giants, is warning 
his teammates not to take the man lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"He can dominate a game," Burt said. "I don't think they have featured him as 
much as they thought they would. I know it's hard for a guy to come in during 
the middle of the season like that, but it seems that the chemistry just isn't 
right." 
</P>
<P>
A notable example of Walker's invisibility occurred in the Vikings' final game, 
a playoff-clinching win over the Cincinnati Bengals on Christmas night. Late in 
the game, the Vikings had first-and-goal from inside the 5-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Three times they ran fullback Rick Fenney into the middle of the line, then 
scored on a short fourth-down pass from Wade Wilson to backup tight end Brent 
Novoselsky. 
</P>
<P>
All four plays occurred with the 6-foot-1, 226-pound Walker in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what their plan is," 49er linebacker Matt Millen said. "We're 
just going to have to account for him. If we don't, that's when he hurts you. 
</P>
<P>
"His skills haven't changed. They haven't diminished. You know in your head 
that he's very fast, but when you're watching him on the field, he doesn't seem 
like he's moving that fast. Then all of a sudden, there he goes, right by you." 
</P>
<P>
Walker's mere presence has forced the 49ers to alter the defensive plan that 
led to last year's 34-9 playoff win over the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
In that game, the 49ers "thought pass first, then reacted to the run," 
defensive end Pierce Holt said. Thinking that way, they sacked Wilson six 
times. 
</P>
<P>
"It will probably be hard for us to do that this week," Holt said. "They've got 
too many weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"With Walker, they've improved their running game. It's in our minds what a 
powerful, fast guy he is. We can't forget that." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Vikings can.

HEIGHT VS. DEFENSE;

<P>
THAT'S THE MATCHUP AS CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS TAKES ON LOYOLA FOR REGIONAL 
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL BRAGGING RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGES: THE LADY LIONS STARTED SLOW BUT HAVE GOTTEN BETTER. THE LADY TOROS 
WERE FAST OFF THE MARK BUT HAVE RECENTLY FALTERED. BOTH COACHES SEE MONDAY'S 
GAME AT LOYOLA AS A KEY TEST.

<P>
The stingy defense of Cal State Dominguez Hills will try to overcome the team's 
decided height disadvantage against Loyola Marymount at 7:30 p.m. Monday in a 
women's basketball game at Loyola's Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola starts three players who are 5-foot-10 or taller. The Lady Lions (6-7) 
have won four of their last seven games after a 2-4 start, including an 86-48 
win last week against visiting Valparaiso. 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills (8-5) is off to its best season in five years, already winning 
more games than it did in all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Lady Toros have lost three of their last four games. They ended a 
three-game losing streak last week with a 62-56 victory at Southern California 
College of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
All of Loyola's victories have come at home. Dominguez Hills is 5-4 on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
The coaches, not surprisingly, take opposite views of their situations. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola's Todd Corman was disappointed with his team's start but seems to be 
more impressed with its play lately. 
</P>
<P>
"We're playing full games now, instead of only three-quarters of a game," 
Corman said. "I'm pleased with the play of my bench." 
</P>
<P>
At Dominguez Hills, second-year Coach Van Girard appears to have succeeded in 
doing the job he was hired to do -- turning around a program in disarray. The 
Lady Toros have never had a 20-win season, and the last time they finished over 
.500 was the 1984-85 season (18-8). 
</P>
<P>
But in view of the Lady Toros' recent skid, Girard views Monday's game as a 
chance to fine-tune several parts of his team's play. 
</P>
<P>
"(Loyola is) a big team that likes to run. We will face teams like that in our 
conference, so it's a good workout for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Corman also sees the game as a test. "We're looking to use our bigger size as 
an advantage, much as we did against Valparaiso," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Girard: "When the season started, we were playing teams who weren't quite 
as good as us physically. Now we're playing teams that are at least as good, 
and that makes things tough on us. 
</P>
<P>
"Mostly we're a young team and we look good, but we have times when we go 
brain-dead on the floor, and we can't afford to do this." 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez Hills is led by 6-foot freshman center Yvonne Vanlandingham from Long 
Beach. Ranking second in the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. in scoring 
with 12.2 points per game, Vanlandingham is is also No.4 in conference 
rebounding with 7.3 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Senior center Khyra Anderson, at 6-foot-3, is the conference's leading 
rebounder with 9.8 per game. 
</P>
<P>
After last year's dismal 6-19 season, marked by offensive problems, this 
figured to be a rebuilding year at Dominguez Hills. At the beginning of the 
season, Girard said he would take defense for granted and work on getting the 
offense to produce. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Dominguez Hills had no player who averaged as much a 10 points a 
game. The team made less than one out of three field-goal tries. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Girard said, the Lady Toros' offense has improved and the defense 
has continued to be good. Dominguez Hills leads CCAA teams in defense against 
field goals, holding opponents to less than one score in three tries. In 
addition, the Lady Toros have has forced opponents to commit 23.5 turnovers a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been keeping it close in all of the games we play, but we lose focus for 
two to four minutes at a stretch," Girard said. "Lately our practices have 
focused on the fundamentals of a better offense and cutting down on those 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
Corman is coming off his best season at Loyola (17-11). The Lady Lions' 
explosive offense -- also a trademark of the Loyola men's team -- got a 
showcasing in the victory over Valapraiso, when the team's 86 points were a 
season high. 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Bruich and Lynn Flanagan lead the scoring for the Lady Lions. Bruich, a 
5-8 junior guard, is the leading scorer with 15.1 points per game. Flanagan, 
also 5-8 and also a junior guard, is having the best year of her career with 
14.3 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Trish Gibson, a 6-foot-3 center, is tops among West Coast Conference players in 
shot blocking, averaging more than three blocks per game. 
</P>
<P>
Another plus for the improving Lady Lions has been the return of Michelle 
Bettencourt, a 6-foot senior forward. Last year's team leader in rebounds (6.5 
a game), she was expected to do the same this season but missed four games with 
an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams begin conference play Friday. Dominguez Hills opens at nationally 
ranked Cal Poly Pomona. The Lady Lions host Santa Clara University.

EL CAMINO SHOCKED BY MT. SAC, 60-58 
</P>

<P>
In a game that matched the defending South Coast Conference champions, El 
Camino College, against a team that hadn't won a conference game in two 
seasons, visiting Mt. San Antonio College shocked the Warriors, 60-58, Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
John Moses hit the game-winning shot for Mt. SAC with 10 seconds left in the 
game. The Warriors were not able to get a shot off before the horn sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"We just could not hit our shots when we really needed to in the second half," 
El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin said. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino (15-5, 0-1) never really got its offense on track. But despite cold 
shooting, the Warriors were able to lead by 10 points at halftime, 32-22, 
because of a tough defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors finished the night shooting a dismal 34% from the field. 
"Basically, our defense kept us in the game," McClurkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing by 13 points in the opening moments of the second half, Mt. SAC got 
its own defense to stiffen. "We decided to play a lot more man-to-man in the 
second half," Coach Ralph Osterkamp said. "That allowed us to get back into the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
The Mountaineers (5-14, 1-0) tied the game when Moses scored with 6:15 
remaining and took the lead on a Ny Bradford lay-in with 5:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
El Camino next plays at Pasadena Community College on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.

<P>
SIMI VALLEY'S DURAN PICKS UP WHERE SHE LEFT OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the Simi Valley High soccer field, goalkeeper Kim Duran is about as 
permanent a fixture as the goal posts. 
</P>
<P>
For two seasons, Duran's durability was exemplified with 54 consecutive starts, 
a school-record 35 shutouts -- including shutouts in all 10 Marmonte League 
matches as a sophomore in 1987-88 -- and a 47-5-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
"Kim is a workaholic," Coach Mark Johnson said. "You can't throw enough work at 
her. I have to send her home after practice because she wants to do more." 
</P>
<P>
All of which might have contributed to Duran's being sidelined with 
mononucleosis in November. But Duran's goal was to get back in goal -- pronto. 
</P>
<P>
"High school soccer," Duran said simply, "is just really important to me." 
</P>
<P>
After six weeks with the illness, Duran made her season debut Thursday and 
posted career shutout No. 36 as the Simi Valley girls' team (17-0), ranked No. 
1 in the Southern Section 4-A Division, blanked Royal, 3-0, to improve to 2-0 
in league play. 
</P>
<P>
"Except for overall conditioning, she hasn't lost anything," Johnson said. "She 
gets tired out there, but her punts are still 40-50 yards. She's a veteran 
keeper." 
</P>
<P>
Duran feared that Johnson might not keep her as his keeper. Hence the 
motivation for a speedy recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"After being out for a month, I knew he wasn't going to give (the starting job) 
back to me," she said. "I had to work my butt off. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great to be back. It's exactly where I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Add soccer: All right, so nobody's perfect. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not the Agoura High girls' team. After 91 consecutive matches (45 of 
them consecutive victories) without a loss, four consecutive Southern Section 
titles (three at the 2-A level, one at 3-A) and two coaching stints by Dave 
Godwin (one for five years, the second for the past three weeks), the Chargers 
finally were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura fell to El Toro, 2-1, Tuesday, snapping the incredible streak. 
</P>
<P>
Godwin, who left the team after last season to pursue educational goals, 
resurfaced in December to replace Coach Don Hagenburger, a friend of Godwin's 
who had been a longtime assistant under him. Godwin has posted a 113-8-11 
record as Agoura coach. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have begun a new winning streak after pounding Santa Ynez, 14-0, 
in a Frontier League opener Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Hurts so bad: Surgery is scheduled Monday for Royal senior goalkeeper Nicki 
Noyes, who suffered severe ligament damage to her left hand while diving for a 
shot during warm-ups Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Noyes, Royal's scoring leader as a sophomore with 15 goals, was fifth on the 
Highlanders' career scoring list before shifting this season to goalie, where 
she is 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
Noyes is lost for the season, according to Coach Kevin Corley, and also is 
questionable for the upcoming softball season. She was an All-Marmonte League 
selection last season as a second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"The team is kind of in shock," Corley said. "Nicki is so tough, no one ever 
imagined her being hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Staci Blough, a starting striker, has missed six games this season 
because of a sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
Basketball: The Burroughs boys' team finished fourth in the Mt. Carmel 
Invitational in San Diego on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians (6-6) defeated San Pascual, 105-78, before losing to Poway, the 
eventual tournament champion, 77-76, and Santa Barbara, 74-66. 
</P>
<P>
Having split two nonleague games this week against Servite (a 60-49 loss) and 
Alemany (a 52-48 victory), the Indians travel to Hart on Tuesday for the first 
of two Foothill League meetings between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Burroughs captured its first league title since 1968, compiling a 
17-7 overall record and a 9-1 mark in league play. 
</P>
<P>
In the stands: Good thing nobody offered to play the San Fernando fans at 
Friday's basketball game with Kennedy in a round of touch football. 
</P>
<P>
In attendance were former Tiger football stars Chris Richards (Cal), Howard 
McCrary (Cal State Fullerton), Keary Johns (Fullerton) and George Glaze (San 
Diego State).

FOR THE RECORD

<P>
Soccer: The Agoura High girls' coach was incorrectly identified in Sunday's 
edition. Agoura's coach is Don Hagenburger, who replaced Dave Godwin this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Godwin, who led the Chargers to four consecutive Southern Section championships 
in his five years as coach, was granted a one-year leave of absence to pursue 
educational goals. His schedule, however, allowed him to return this season as 
an assistant to Hagenburger. 
</P>

Godwin will return as coach next season, according to John Crow, the school's

DOMINGUEZ HILLS SAGS IN 58-44 LOSS TO BIOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You can point your finger at a lot of things this season that have produced a 
basketball team at Cal State Dominguez Hills that is on a pace to have the 
worst record in school history: 
</P>
<P>
Relying on too many freshmen, not enough bench strength, and a lack of height 
in its front line. 
</P>
<P>
But to Coach Dave Yanai, the biggest problem is that he has not found a player 
willing to "rise to the occasion." 
</P>
<P>
To Yanai, that means leadership. And, yes, he admitted earlier in the week, 
Dominguez Hills lacks leadership on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
At no time was that more evident than Saturday night, when the Toros wandered 
aimlessly for 40 minutes in a 58-44 loss at Biola University. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago the Toros defeated Biola, 65-46, in Carson. But since that time 
Dominguez Hills lost 69-56 to Quincy College of Illinois while Biola was 
winning three of its four games. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's game was the final non-conference game for Dominguez Hills 
(4-9) before its California Collegiate Athletic Assn. opener Friday at Cal Poly 
Pomona. It was supposed to be a tune-up. Perhaps now an overhaul is in order. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai may have had that in mind anyway after admitting his frustration with his 
club after the loss to Illinois, a game the Toros dominated for the first 20 
minutes. He shook up his line against Biola. He benched all five starters, 
including three freshman players that he considers the franchise of the future. 
</P>
<P>
And the tactic seemed to work early in the game. In the first half alone, the 
Toros made six of 24 field goal attempts, committed 7 turnovers and went nearly 
10 minutes without a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Biola (7-11), just a shadow of the team that once won a national record 
39 games, was a gracious host. Dominguez Hills trailed only 10-9 with 8:30 left 
because the Eagles made only seven field goals in the first 20 minutes. They 
also committed seven turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Biola pulled away slowly in the second half, leading 46-31 with five minutes to 
go thanks to four baskets and two free throws from sophomore center Jeff Baker 
and a pair of three-point baskets by freshman forward Jimmy Hill.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: HOST PLNC WINS TITLE IN BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Point Loma Nazarene College won its own men's basketball tournament for the 
first time in four years with a 87-69 victory over George Fox College Saturday 
night. Ron Hubbard, named the tournament MVP, led PLNC (5-8) with 26 points and 
nine rebounds, and Brian Thurston added 17 points and six rebounds. PLNC has 
won its past three games. 
</P>
<P>
Willamette College shot 62% from the floor and 67% from three-point range to 
beat UC San Diego, 86-75, in the La Jolla Tournament finals. UCSD (10-4) was 
led by Gordon McNeill's 21 and Tim Rapp's 20. Both players were named to the 
all-tournament team. Willamette's Erik Clarkson, the tournament MVP, paced all 
scorers with 36 points on 15-of-20 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage upset Malone College of Ohio, the No. 1 ranked team in the 
National Christian College Athletic Assn., 97-92. 
</P>
<P>
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
Playing without starting center Christie English and losing backup forward 
Rochelle Lightner early in the first half, the University of San Diego women 
were no match for host Colorado, losing 78-46 in a nonconference game. 
</P>
<P>
After winning nine of their first 10 games, the Toreras (10-3) have lost two in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
English missed the game with the flu, and Lightner broke her nose in the first 
10 minutes. USD's problems continued when starting forward Lynda Jones picked 
up four fouls and Kathy Perkins, a 5-foot-10 small forward, was forced to play 
the low post. And point guard Paula Mascari cracked a contact lens early and 
finished with no points in 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Candida Echeverria led the Toreros with nine points but was only three for 10 
from the field. USD begins West Coast Conference play Friday at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
Teri Mann's basketball career at San Diego State apparently has ended before it 
began. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, a four-time all-section girls' player from Point Loma High, has dropped 
out of SDSU, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
Mann, who transferred to SDSU from Western Kentucky last January, was suspended 
by SDSU Coach Beth Burns in December for failing to meet academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Burns said Mann was not forced off the team. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball was in Terri's court," Burns said. "Her scholarship was not taken 
away." 
</P>
<P>
Burns said she had not been told of Mann's decision to quit school. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't talked to her," Burns said. "I think it's a shame. She has to make 
the decision on what she wants to do with her life." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State trailed ninth-ranked Long Beach State by just seven at halftime 
but eventually lost, 74-53, in the Aztecs' Big West Conference opener. SDSU 
(1-11, 0-1) was led by Julie Evans' 18 points. Dana Wilkerson had a game-high 
19 for Long Beach (8-3, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Abrams had 10 points and 11 rebounds in Point Loma Nazarene's 83-36 
victory over host Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
UC San Diego upset previously unbeaten Lake Forest College of Illinois, 77-57 
in a nonconference game at UCSD. Cari Young paced UCSD (5-5) with 14 points and 
10 rebounds.

WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: CHEVRON HAS JUST CAUSE TO DOUBT PENNZOIL'S MOTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Chevron Corp. just paranoid, or does having Pennzoil Co. as a major 
stockholder really pose a threat to its independence? It turns out that its 
fears could be justified -- at least if you interpret tax law the way that 
Chevron does. 
</P>
<P>
If there was one thing that amazed Wall Street after Pennzoil confessed that it 
had purchased nearly 9% of Chevron's stock, it was the harsh reaction that the 
disclosure elicited from Chevron's management. 
</P>
<P>
No company likes another company buying its shares. But Pennzoil went out of 
its way to assure Chevron that it bought the 27 million shares because it was 
trying to avoid a big federal tax bill on the billions that it won in a lawsuit 
against Texaco. Pennzoil said repeatedly that it wasn't interested in acquiring 
Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that Chevron actually believes that Pennzoil isn't looking for an 
acquisition. What it doesn't believe is that Pennzoil will be content as a 
passive investor. Chevron thinks the only way that Pennzoil can avoid a big tax 
bill is to actively influence Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
"To get the kind of tax treatment that they are talking about -- a tax deferral 
-- they've got to replace the property they had with property that's similar," 
says a source who's very familiar with Chevron's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Pennzoil received its award from Texaco after Texaco illegally interfered with 
Pennzoil's acquisition of Getty Oil. And since Pennzoil would have had direct 
influence over Getty and its assets, Chevron now believes that Pennzoil would 
need to exert comparable influence over Chevron to win what will be a tough 
battle with the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to get something that looks like what they had at Getty," the source 
says. The Getty agreement would have given Pennzoil control over the top 
positions in the company, board seats and structural control, the source notes. 
</P>
<P>
"To get this kind of replacement requires them to be something more than a 
passive investor in Chevron," the source added. "I don't know what their intent 
is, but it's not to be a passive investor." 
</P>
<P>
And you think your tax return is going to be complicated. 
</P>
<P>
Stock Market's Always Warm in January 
</P>
<P>
Are you an investor who's tired of tracking interest rates? And are you bored 
with trying to figure out whether the economy is, or isn't, in a recession? 
</P>
<P>
Then maybe you should base your investment decisions on the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
In his annual booklet called "The Stock Traders Almanac," market guru Yale 
Hirsch points out that January has been the second-best month for stocks during 
the past 37 years. So investors whose only research tool is the calendar 
wouldn't have been too surprised by last week's sudden spurt in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
January's average 1.5% rise in prices is topped only by the 1.9% average gain 
recorded by all the Novembers from 1950 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody, of course, really knows why the stock market would do well in January 
and November. But Hirsch and I thought up a few possible explanations. The 
optimism that accompanies any new year could account for January's gain, while 
relief that elections are over could explain November's euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
If Hirsch is onto something, investors should be careful next month. Stock 
prices have fallen an average 0.1% in February. But the two worst months are 
May and September, down 0.5% and 0.6% respectively. 
</P>
<P>
What Will Develop in the Polaroid Case? 
</P>
<P>
Polaroid's litigation against rival Eastman Kodak is coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
But two major questions remain: How much will Kodak have to pay Polaroid for 
infringing on its patents? And when will Judge David Mazzone of the U.S. 
District Court in Boston decide on the amount? 
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Wall Street has been raising its estimate of the windfall. It 
is widely speculated that Kodak will be forced to fork over an incredible $1.5 
billion to $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
That guess may or may not turn out to be right. But Wall Street has another 
thing wrong. Mazzone won't make his decision in the next few weeks, as has been 
rumored in the financial markets. His decision probably won't come until March 
at the earliest, according to a source familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
But, heck, that'll just leave more time for the excitement to build. And it is 
getting exciting. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, had thought that the 
most Polaroid could hope for was $800 million. But recently, after reading the 
264 pages of post-trial briefs that Polaroid submitted to Mazzone just before 
Christmas, Henderson was so moved that he upped his estimate to $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The Polaroid brief fleshed out its critical arguments substantially," 
Henderson says. Before that, he says, Kodak looked like it could argue for a 
lighter award. 
</P>
<P>
But weighing the pot o' gold doesn't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
Mazzone could decide to treble the damages as punishment to Kodak. Henderson 
figures that will give Polaroid $2 billion. (The interest on the award, which 
is included in the $1.5 billion, would not be tripled.) 
</P>
<P>
Over at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., analyst Peter Enderlin has his 
own calculations. He recently told clients that Polaroid could get $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the investment community are making a case for as little as $600 
million in damages to as much as $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing that is certain is that Polaroid will get something from 
Mazzone. And that has been enough to levitate Polaroid's stock of late. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the post-award situation could shape up. Analysts feel that Kodak 
could weather an award of up to $2 billion without its stock being hurt. If 
Polaroid gets more than that, Kodak shares -- now in the mid-$40s -- could get 
walloped. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the mid-$40s, Polaroid's stock price probably already has an award of 
$600 million to $800 million calculated into it. 
</P>
<P>
An award of $1.5 billion could get Polaroid's stock up to $53 a share, the 
analysts believe. And in the unlikely event that it gets $3 billion, Polaroid's 
shares could be worth $70. 
</P>
<P>
Spin the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
No Speedy Conclusion Expected in Hilton Sale 
</P>
<P>
If you are waiting for the Hilton deal to be completed, you'd better find 
yourself a comfortable chair. And you might also want to cool your expectations 
a bit. A reliable Wall Street source who is familiar with what's going on in 
the negotiations to buy Hilton tells me that he'd be surprised if anything 
major happens for at least another month. 
</P>
<P>
Only the first round of bids have been submitted so far and, as reported by the 
Wall Street Journal, the prices right now seem to be about $90 a share. But 
even that isn't chiseled in granite. The source says bankers all over the world 
have gotten pretty cheap lately, and Hilton may not have the cash flow to 
justify even a $90 price. Last summer, when takeovers were hot, people thought 
that Hilton might fetch as much as $140 a share. 
</P>
<P>
And the most recent timetable had been to have some sort of authoritative 
announcement later this month. All of that is now wishful thinking, the source 
says. There is one bit of good news: Barron Hilton hasn't threatened yet to 
take his company off the market. 
</P>
<P>
Good News and Bad in Eastern Europe 
</P>
<P>
A lot of good things will come out of the political reforms occurring in 
Eastern Europe. You've heard these before: The economies of the Soviet Bloc 
nations will open up to Western products; billions of dollars that the United 
States now spends on defense can be used to fight some pressing domestic 
problems, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
But, as is often the case in life, there is a downside for the United States 
that could result from the political upheaval in these lands. Money that 
European and Japanese corporations might have spent opening operations in the 
United States could be diverted to the lower-wage countries such as East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Rona, head of IBJ Schroder, a unit of the Industrial Bank of Japan, says 
conversations that he has had during recent trips to Eastern Europe indicate 
just such a trend. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans are losers and not losers," predicts Rona, who has very strong ties 
to Eastern Europe and the Far East. Americans are losing, he says, "in the 
sense of reduced European investment in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
But there is nothing to keep American companies from starting, or acquiring, 
subsidiaries in Eastern Europe so that they, too, can compete in the newly 
opened markets. General Electric, for instance, recently acquired a Hungarian 
light bulb manufacturer, and American telecommunications companies have been 
fighting for business in Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
European companies have been big investors in the United States over the years. 
Not only have they invested in financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasury 
securities, but they've also acquired companies, built manufacturing plants and 
made investments in joint ventures in the auto, steel and other industries. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy would have suffered had these investments not been made. 
</P>
<P>
If Rona is correct, American business will have to make changes if it is to 
keep its U.S. plants running with foreign help. Two things that American 
companies will have to do are: get back into the forefront of technological 
advances and better prepare American workers. 
</P>
<P>
Rona says one West German manufacturing executive recently drove home this 
point. Why, the West German said, should I invest money in plant and equipment 
in the United States and have to put up with ill-trained workers and drug 
problems, when I can build facilities in East Germany and hire good, dedicated 
workers at a much lower cost? 
</P>
<P>
"People here are still not sufficiently sensitive to the fact of foreign 
competition," says Rona.

TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON: WESTERN LESSONS FOR EASTERN 
EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON, LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON is professor of economics at the 
University of California, Berkeley, and research director of the Berkeley 
Roundtable on the International Economy. This year, she is a visiting professor 
at the Harvard Business School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The philosophes of the Enlightenment postulated the existence of a "state of 
nature" from which human beings negotiated a social contract. In societies 
encrusted with tradition, this notion is merely a useful metaphor. But 
occasionally, some great historical spasm may lead to circumstances that 
actually approximate a state of nature and citizens suddenly discover that they 
have the opportunity to redesign their society virtually anew. 
</P>
<P>
The East European countries find themselves in such circumstances. Indeed, 
negotiations over the terms of a new social contract have already begun. 
</P>
<P>
How can these societies organize themselves in a manner conducive to 
prosperity, productivity and simple fairness? Neither unleashing unbridled 
market forces nor maintaining bureaucratic central planning is the answer. The 
failures of the latter course are patent -- indeed, they are the primary 
impulse for revolutions throughout the Eastern bloc. 
</P>
<P>
But additionally -- as even Adam Smith, the father of capitalist theory, 
understood -- market incentives do not adequately address important collective 
needs. In the short run, the self-interested pursuit of profits provides 
powerful incentives for individual effort and drives resources toward their 
highest-paying use. But a system based solely on private motives and private 
returns overlooks important collective goals essential to the long-run quality 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
The free market frenzy in the United States during the past decade demonstrates 
some of the pitfalls of unregulated capitalism. Despite the longest sustained 
expansion of the postwar period, the United States faces unresolved and 
worsening crises in education and health care. The nation's infrastructure is 
deteriorating at an alarming pace, while the environmental toll of private 
economic activities continues to mount. Lax regulation of businesses with 
significant spillover effects, such as the savings and loan industry, has 
allowed private actors to make fortunes at the taxpayers' expense. 
</P>
<P>
And the "supply-side" expectation that the greater enrichment of the wealthy 
would result in dramatic trickle-down benefits for the poor has given way to 
the reality of greater income inequality and a higher poverty rate, 
increasingly concentrated among the very young. 
</P>
<P>
In designing their new social contracts, the East Europeans must struggle to 
find the right blend of institutions and policies to encourage private 
initiative without sacrificing collective needs. Some examples are obvious and 
are already common in many advanced capitalist economies. 
</P>
<P>
As most of the West European nations have demonstrated, high levels of 
efficiency, productivity and innovation are consistent with -- indeed are 
supported by -- comprehensive social welfare programs that include health care, 
family support, care for the aged, unemployment compensation and worker 
retraining and relocation assistance. In Eastern Europe, where the termination 
of government support for unsuccessful state-owned firms threatens the 
livelihood of millions of workers, programs providing temporary support for 
dislocated workers and their families are especially important. 
</P>
<P>
But safety-net measures are not enough. In their understandable rush to 
dismantle the bureaucratic apparatus that strangled private initiative for so 
long, the East Europeans must be mindful of other appropriate and beneficial 
roles that government can play in market economies. For example, public 
programs will be required to meet the vast infrastructural needs of the region, 
and to reverse the environmental ravages of the past 40 years. There is no 
historical evidence that such collective concerns will be served by private 
market incentives. 
</P>
<P>
Nor are unregulated markets always likely to yield desirable economic outcomes. 
Because the East Europeans have inherited highly concentrated industrial 
structures in which very few large firms account for the bulk of production in 
most industries, antitrust and other regulatory codes specifying allowable 
business practices are essential. 
</P>
<P>
Regulation is also of great importance in the development and operation of 
financial markets. Such markets have both private and collective functions in 
modern economies. As the savings and loan debacle in the United States 
demonstrates, a reduction in regulation is not always in the collective 
interest. And as the prosperity and stability of the Japanese financial markets 
demonstrate, a high degree of regulation and administrative guidance over the 
decisions of private financial institutions can be the handmaiden of their 
success. Even as the East Europeans gut many existing institutions of 
government, they must erect powerful, autonomous central banks to realize the 
financial and macroeconomic stability on which market capitalism depends. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the newly elected governments in Eastern Europe will have to confront 
the problem of income inequality endemic to capitalism. Given the long 
tradition of egalitarianism in these societies, the emergence of large income 
differences, especially if accompanied by a decline in incomes for the poorest 
groups, is likely to produce the kind of popular resistance that could throttle 
further reform. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the experience of the advanced capitalist economies indicates that 
progressive income taxation and social welfare programs to assuage 
distributional inequities need not impede prosperity. Contrary to what avid 
supply siders argue, there is no simple relationship between national economic 
performance and the pretax or post-tax distribution of income. Among the 
advanced industrial countries, the United States has one of the most uneven 
distributions of income, accompanied by one of the lowest productivity growth 
rates, whereas Sweden, Japan and West Germany, with far more even 
distributions, boast superior productivity records. 
</P>
<P>
Although the East Europeans have much to learn from the experience of other 
capitalist nations, in one area they are traveling in largely uncharted waters: 
They must design mechanisms to transfer state-owned enterprises, which are the 
backbone of their industrial economies, to some form of private ownership. But 
when few of their own citizens can afford to purchase these enterprises, and 
those who can are likely to have profitted most, either legally or illegally, 
under the old rules, how can this transfer be achieved equitably? And how can 
it be achieved in ways that prevent an excessive concentration of the nation's 
wealth, and in ways that give the workers, who are well-educated and skilled, a 
stake in the performance of their enterprises? 
</P>
<P>
The answer to these questions seems to lie in programs allowing groups of 
workers to purchase state assets and in programs giving workers some 
participation in enterprise decision making and profits even when they are not 
among its owners. Collective ownership of firms by groups of workers -- 
so-called joint-stock companies -- may represent the best means for dispersing 
the ownership of state assets and placing them in the hands of those most 
knowledgeable about how to utilize them. Such an arrangement also provides the 
motivation for enthusiastic worker effort that was sorely lacking under central 
planning. Furthermore, it's consistent with the goal of democracy underlying 
the recent revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
But the East Europeans must not limit themselves to collective ownership 
arrangements alone. Private ownership is vital to the success of market 
capitalism. Yet, as growing evidence from the developed capitalist economies 
indicates, privately owned companies that provide meaningful participation and 
profit sharing for their employees are likely to be repaid by increased worker 
effort and productivity. For the nascent East European leaders, who have been 
given the task of designing systems of greater democracy and greater 
productivity, programs to encourage the adoption of participatory arrangements 
in private companies should be especially attractive. 
</P>
<P>
The challenges confronting the East European nations are enormous. Inevitably, 
as they seek to meet them, they will look westward for models and for guidance. 
But if they succeed, we in the West may well be casting our eyes eastward for 
lessons in how to achieve capitalism with a human face in the 21st Century.

THE LATEST JUNK BOND SCAM?; 
</P>
<P>
SECURITIES: WALL STREET'S NEWEST SHELL GAME INVOLVES PACKAGING JUNK BONDS. BUT 
THERE'S NO PEA UNDER THE SHELL -- ONLY THE POTENTIAL FOR BIG LOSSES FOR BANK, 
INSURANCE FIRMS AND TAXPAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MAYER, MARTIN MAYER, author of Markets and The Money Bazaars, is 
working on a book about the origins of the savings and loan mess. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the most wondrous Wall Street inventions of the 1980s was the 
"collateralized mortgage obligation," or CMO, which is responsible for perhaps 
$10 billion of the losses suffered by the nation's S&amp;Ls on their way down 
the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
Now, new for the 1990s, we have the "collateralized bond obligation," or CBO. 
The CBO is a package of junk bonds that somehow stop looking like junk because 
they are packaged. It has the potential to create even bigger losses for banks 
and insurance companies and taxpayers, while generating big profits for Wall 
Street and its friends in business schools. 
</P>
<P>
The CMO was a kind of bond backed by home mortgages. It paid bondholders with 
proceeds of homeowners' monthly payments. The art of marketing it was the 
division of this payment stream into separate "tranches," which were sold 
separately to investors. 
</P>
<P>
The top tranche got first grab at all the money that homeowners paid, and it 
was very, very safe. After holders of the top tranche were paid, the payments 
stream went to the second tranche, which was still pretty safe, and so on until 
it got to a "residual" holder who was entitled to what came in after everybody 
else got his. 
</P>
<P>
This residual might or might not get paid, depending on lots of factors too 
complicated to explain not only to readers of a family newspaper but also to 
the S&amp;L executives who bought the stuff. Because it was risky paper, it 
promised big returns -- though not, of course, for some years, until after the 
holders of the senior tranches had been paid off. 
</P>
<P>
Artful Wall Street salesmen persuaded S&amp;Ls and institutional investors to 
pay more for the package of tranches in a CMO than they would have paid for the 
mortgages themselves. Asked why that should be so, Kevin Villani, then chief 
economist of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), explained to a 
meeting of colleagues that "there's one born every minute." 
</P>
<P>
The trick was to get S&amp;Ls to buy the less safe pieces. 
</P>
<P>
The sales pitch carried the fancy name "risk-adjusted arbitrage." What the name 
was supposed to mean was that the Wall Street house promised (cross-my-heart) 
that the S&amp;L could get a better return on its money while reducing its 
risks. Michael Lewis' new best-selling book, "Liar's Poker," has 40 funny pages 
on how this snake oil was peddled by the Wall Street investment firm Salomon 
Bros. in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L regulators, on days when they weren't out to lunch, tended to take a 
benign view of this paper. Permitting an S&amp;L to book income on bonds that 
wouldn't actually pay off for some years was an easy way to make it look 
healthy even though it was sick. 
</P>
<P>
Trading profits on this paper could be recorded as they happened, under S&amp;L 
accounting rules. Trading losses could be buried by carrying the stuff on the 
books at cost. Everything, of course, was bought with money from insured 
deposits. When riskier tranches turned out to be worthless, and the S&amp;L 
failed, taxpayers had to pay off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the CBO. It packages junk bonds just as the CMO packages mortgages, into 
tranches. The idea springs from the imagination of Fred Carr, head of First 
Executive Corp., a Los Angeles-based life insurer. First Executive was one of 
Michael Milken's biggest customers. Carr promised purchasers of his insurance 
policies that the value of those policies would grow quickly based on the high 
earnings from Milken's junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
As the junk bonds have grown riskier, however, state insurance commissioners 
have wanted First Executive to keep greater financial reserves against the 
payments that it will have to make on its policies. 
</P>
<P>
Hence the CBO. Carr has converted many of his junk bonds into CBOs, and has 
kept all the tranches. He argues that a smaller fraction of his assets is in 
risky paper as a result, simply because the top tranches of his CBOs are safe, 
having first claim on all payments from the packages of junk bonds. It's a pure 
shell game, but the insurance commissioners have kindly allowed First Executive 
to lop $110 million off its required reserves. 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't the purpose of this activity, Doug Marcian, executive vice 
president of First Executive, told the Wall Street Journal. The purpose was 
just "to create securities that were worth more than the underlying assets." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine a clearer statement of the illusionism that the financial 
services industry has been staging for investors. Obviously, there is no pea 
under any of these shells. Asset-backed securities cannot be worth more than 
the underlying assets. It's just that the salesmen can sell them for more. 
</P>
<P>
This sort of idea catches on fast. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Spiegel, who built Columbia Savings &amp; Loan of Beverly Hills, a rival 
of Carr's First Executive as Milken's premiere customer, has resigned from the 
deteriorating S&amp;L and plans to work with the Wall Street house of First 
Boston to repackage Columbia's nearly $4-billion junk bond portfolio into CBOs 
that can be sold for more than the assets are worth. 
</P>
<P>
The CBO phenomenon has also spread to the banks, which have begun packaging 
their leveraged buyout loans into CBOs for sale. A recent CBO made from $675 
million of U.S. leveraged buyout loans was sold in London on a basis where the 
bottom tranche is a zero-coupon bond that will, with luck, yield 20 percentage 
points a year over the London interbank interest rate. That means the rate is 
30% right now. 
</P>
<P>
Zero-coupon bonds pay all the interest they promise in one lump sum at their 
expiration dates. But holders of such bonds can credit themselves with an 
interest payment every year. That doesn't help ordinary people much because 
ordinary people need cash income. But banks don't need this cash income, they 
can always get money simply by promising a higher interest rate on insured 
deposits. Similarly, life insurance companies are happy with investments that 
pay off only years from now because they don't have to pay the benefits until 
years from now. 
</P>
<P>
Banks want to sell loans these days because new worldwide capital rules require 
them to put more of their own money (rather than just depositors' money) into 
their investments. If they sell off the low-yielding safe parts of the CBO, and 
keep the high-yielding risky parts, they can credit themselves with more income 
per dollar of assets. And because their total assets are reduced, they don't 
have to put up as much capital to satisfy the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Banking regulators are dangerously sympathetic these days to banks that need 
more high-yielding assets because they have all those losses on loans to Latin 
America and real estate developers. If we are going to compete with foreigners, 
our banks have to show good profits, don't they? 
</P>
<P>
Economist Villani's analysis of why this magic junk would sell was incomplete. 
There are really two born every minute: one in the marketplace, and one in the 
financial services regulatory machinery. Having observed how the S&amp;L 
regulators get laughed at these days every time they show their faces in 
public, maybe the other financial regulators can start taking their 
responsibilities more seriously. It has been reported that the California 
insurance commission is re-evaluating its reduction of Carr's required reserve. 
That sounds like a good idea.

CUDAHY: COUNCIL, HOWEVER, VOTES TO RETAIN DIRECTOR JAMES GRAHAM. COUNCILMEN 
QUESTION ONCE-CRITICAL COLLEAGUE'S VOTE IN FAVOR OF GRAHAM NOT LONG AFTER LIBEL 
SUIT IS DROPPED.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A divided City Council voted to evict the controversial Cudahy Social Service 
Agency from a city-owned building and take over the agency's food distribution 
program for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
But the council, by a 3-2 vote, also decided to leave the program in the charge 
of the agency's director, James Graham, who was heading the agency when city 
officials, citing inadequate record-keeping, cut off funds in 1988. Graham will 
be paid $36,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
One of the votes to retain Graham was cast by Councilman John Robertson, who 
had been highly critical of Graham, and had been named as a defendant by Graham 
in a libel suit. Graham announced Tuesday at the council meeting that he had 
dropped the suit late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Two agency supporters, Councilmen Bill Colon and Tom Thurman, joined Robertson 
in voting to cancel the agency's lease and to take immediate possession of the 
city-owned building, which also has been occupied by four other nonprofit 
organizations that rented offices from the Cudahy Social Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, all but one of the agencies will continue to operate in the 
building. The agencies provide food, clothing, advice and other help to 
disadvantaged people. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water," Robertson said last 
week after the meeting. "We still need these services in Cudahy. Hopefully now 
we will function better than before." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Joseph Graffio and Councilman Joe Fregeau voted against the proposal and 
questioned Robertson's motives during a raucous council session. Graffio and 
Fregeau pointed out that Robertson's proposal surfaced after Graham decided to 
drop the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson later vehemently denied any such connection. "I get tired of 
answering all these charges against me . . . wild accusations are not the way 
to conduct business," he said. "Mr. Graham and I have had our disagreements, 
but he has the background. I didn't have another suggestion. Graham just didn't 
have the support before. He's not the real problem here. The real problem is 
that the two Joes (Graffio and Fregeau) want to throw the whole thing out. They 
don't want social services in Cudahy." 
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Graham said he dropped the suit because he "got tired of 
fighting." He could not be reached for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
The council decision is the latest chapter in the Cudahy Social Service 
Agency's controversial history. City officials suspended payments to the agency 
from Community Development Block Grant funds in September, 1988, after an 
independent audit found that the agency could not adequately document how it 
was spending its money. One month later, the city tried to evict the agency for 
nonpayment of rent. In August, 1989, the city's Redevelopment Agency, which 
leases the building, approved an out-of-court settlement for $40,000 in back 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
Eviction efforts were renewed last month after city officials learned that the 
state Franchise Tax Board had suspended the agency's nonprofit status for 
failure to file income tax returns. At Tuesday's meeting, City Atty. Glenn 
Watson informed the council that it could cancel the agency's lease since the 
agency was not recognized as a legal nonprofit corporation. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson then presented the council with a plan to take immediate possession 
of the building, draw up leases with the four independent social service 
agencies renting offices in the building, and retain Graham. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal also prevents any councilman from maintaining an office in the 
building, a reference to charges that Colon, who is up for reelection this 
year, was using the building as his political headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Colon had worked as a volunteer at the Cudahy Social Service Agency, and 
recently formed Operation Upbeat, a youth agency that had an office in the 
building. Colon, who previously denied using the office for political purposes, 
said that he has moved the youth program. 
</P>
<P>
After Fregeau denounced the plan during the council meeting, Graham said he was 
sick of fighting over the agency. He said angrily that he would get the lease 
and "burn it in front of you on the podium, if that will make you happy." 
</P>
<P>
Graffio and Fregeau also questioned plans to reduce tenants' rent to about $60 
a month each from about $375 each. The reduced rent would not allow the city to 
pay $3,000 a month to retain Graham and pay the building's electricity bills, 
which run about $2,000 a month, according to the councilmen. 
</P>
<P>
They also said the city should make arrangements with other agencies to 
distribute food and clothing, rather than taking over those programs from the 
Social Service Agency. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Robertson's proposal to retain Graham as director that generated 
most of the debate. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson once accused Graham of misusing agency funds and demanded a grand 
jury investigation. In the fall of 1988, shortly after Robertson's accusations 
were published, Graham announced that he was filing a libel suit. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's meeting, Fregeau questioned whether Robertson could introduce a 
motion to retain Graham, saying the libel suit created a conflict of interest. 
Graham then told the council that he had dropped the suit. He said he did not 
remember exactly when he withdrew the suit, but said he believed it was 
sometime in November or December. 
</P>
<P>
Graham had announced at a council meeting in mid-December that he had resigned 
as the agency's director. He said Tuesday that the board of directors refused 
to accept his letter of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
But Georgia Scrivner, one of the board members, said the board had not met, nor 
had she had any contact with the other two members.

A YEAR LATER, HOME BUYERS SETTLE IN, FEEL THEY BELONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day last year, when my life seemed difficult and I had just come home from 
work, I found a bowl of gardenias on the doorstep, placed there by one of my 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
I inhaled the intensely sweet scent and felt very much at home on Eldora Road 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
When my wife, Milbre Burch, and I first moved into this house, we worried about 
crime. We worried about paying too much to buy the one-story, smoky-blue stucco 
three-bedroom. And we worried about settling in a gentrifying neighborhood 
where we knew no one. 
</P>
<P>
Buying this house was the first step toward becoming members of a neighborhood 
and a community, and committing ourselves to living in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Today, as relative newcomers from the East Coast, we've grown to enjoy our 
Northwest Pasadena neighborhood, a pleasant, microcosmic mix of suburb and 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Since we bought our house, two others have sold on the street of 39 residences. 
A third is now for sale. 
</P>
<P>
So, as Milbre pointed out the other night, "we're no longer the newcomers." 
</P>
<P>
A year has passed since we first moved in. And now we look back on 12 months of 
adjustment, apprehension and joy. 
</P>
<P>
To our relief, we were not victims of crime. Trouble did descend on surrounding 
streets, but apparently not on ours. 
</P>
<P>
At night, I still wake to the thwap-thwap-thwap of police helicopters or the 
barking of neighborhood dogs that function as overly sensitive burglar alarms. 
But Pasadena Police Sgt. Don Forster told me, "As far as a crime problem on 
Eldora Road, there isn't one." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, though, he acknowledged, illegal drugs flourish. And spin-off crimes 
such as burglary and assaults ripple throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
As he said this, I was reminded of two drive-by shootings: one, soon after we 
moved in, to the south, and another, several months later, to the north. 
</P>
<P>
For me, the crime spin-off shows up in the form of graffiti tagging on stores 
and even houses. And one day, less than two blocks from home, I was shocked 
when I turned a corner only to have my car blocked by three young men who had 
parked at an angle so that they could urinate without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
A young professional who lives northwest of Eldora Road told me that he is 
concerned about how city leaders will oversee the delicate issues of 
gentrification in the city's Northwest, a rich mixture of ethnicity and 
economics. "That's going to be a real conundrum," he said. "And it's going to 
change local politics because there's a whole new breed of us yuppies moving 
in." 
</P>
<P>
He is irritated by what he sees as a lack of city interest in coping with the 
problems. "The neighborhood is slowly getting better," he said, "but there's a 
crack house five doors away." 
</P>
<P>
To the southwest, 10 blocks away on Summit Avenue, Pasadena police and the Los 
Angeles County district attorney officially declared an apartment house a drug 
nuisance. That made the landlord more accountable, police said, and has 
resulted in improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Improvements or not, Milbre and I don't walk there. We stick closer to home or 
go in other directions. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does my wife like to go to the place I call the "jailhouse mini-mart" 
because of its barred windows. She's intimidated by what she refers to as "the 
Free-Will Drinking University" in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, last week she said: "I'm starting to feel more comfortable taking 
walks alone during the day. But I'm still not as comfortable walking at night 
as when we lived in our old neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Crime has affected us indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
The tall, pencil-thin man with a big grin is dead. In his late 70s, he lived in 
a retirement home a short walk away. 
</P>
<P>
I knew him only as Bill. We always said hello. Late last year, he was mugged. 
After a few weeks in the hospital, he died. 
</P>
<P>
In my mind's eye, I can still see him, cowboy hat bobbing on his head as he 
made his way down the street, going door to door looking for grass to mow, 
leaves to rake. 
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't much of a gardener. But I sure liked him," said a neighbor who used 
to hire him. "Nobody deserves to die the way he did." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, on her first visit to our house, my mother and I took a walk. "I 
don't see what you mean by gentrification," she said. "This is a nice street." 
</P>
<P>
Around the corner, an elegant two-story stucco house recently sold for 
$400,000. And I'm always amazed at the army of weekend renovators, resodding 
lawns, installing irrigation systems, painting, and, in some cases, nearly 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as we walked to other streets, the picture shifted. She pointed to 
porches where tattered chairs sat, stuffing spilling out. We passed a lawn of 
not much more than dirt. We saw a dilapidated duplex that has been empty and 
undergoing repairs for the last year. 
</P>
<P>
We've learned that such contrasts have contributed to the neighborhood's 
reputation as an affordable haven for first-time home buyers. Although we 
worried that we paid too much, $225,000, we still see real estate agents 
cruising the street to take pictures of our house for comparative purposes. 
Prices continue to climb, though more slowly than during the real estate fever 
of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
And I joined one couple on the street as they fantasized about becoming equity 
refugees. One day, as they complained about smog and crime, I looked through 
their real estate brochures from the Carolinas. They could exchange the Eldora 
Road residence, they said, for a plantation house on four acres. An intriguing 
idea, they said again recently. 
</P>
<P>
"This neighborhood is rich with wonderful people. You're going to love it," a 
new friend, an artist who lives 12 blocks away, told us when we made a 
Christmastime visit to her bungalow. She spoke about two friends, a movie set 
designer and a scriptwriter, who live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
One of the people we met the first night we visited our street, a teacher, has 
become a good friend. Through her, we have met others and shared garden tools 
and handymen. 
</P>
<P>
When we first moved, we had a number of unsettling encounters with homeless and 
displaced people looking for work or help. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, a Salvadoran handyman has touched my life. He's an extraordinary day 
laborer, referred to me by a neighbor. Our friend first met him one day last 
year on a Pasadena street corner where many others like him seek work. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife and three children still in El Salvador, he lives by himself in a 
small apartment hardly a five-minute walk from our house. 
</P>
<P>
Over tuna sandwiches one noonday last month, we talked in Spanish about how he 
came to Pasadena nine years ago after crossing the border, alone and at night. 
</P>
<P>
He speaks very little English, although he did take English and American 
history as part of his immigration amnesty classes. I asked what he knew about 
the United States. There were 13 original colonies, he said. Then he spoke of 
George Washington and the American Revolution. And then he made the sad leap to 
the bitter war in his own homeland. 
</P>
<P>
When moments like this happen in our now not-so-new home, I am happy and do not 
want to live anywhere else in the world.

CRIME: DAVID RICKARD, A FORMER YOUTH COUNSELOR, MAINTAINS THAT HE IS INNOCENT 
OF 120 COUNTS OF ORAL COPULATION WITH A MINOR FILED IN TWO CITIES.

SIERRA MADRE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his steady blue eyes and boyish grin, the unswerving loyalty of his 
elderly parents and the comfort of their wood-beamed 1908 home as a backdrop, 
it's easy to believe David Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
The 39-year-old former youth pastor and counselor has a quietly self-confident 
demeanor that has helped him start youth groups and anti-drug abuse programs in 
several California communities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Rickard is either a persuasive con man or he is innocent, as he insists, of 
120 counts of oral copulation with a minor filed against him in Redding and 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine one kid saying one thing, and you lose it all," Rickard said. "The 
people that know me don't believe that this stuff happened at all." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Gaul, the Shasta County deputy district attorney who prosecuted Rickard in 
Redding, has no problem believing "this stuff" happened, however. He thinks 
Rickard just has his supporters charmed. "The guy's kind of a charismatic 
person," Gaul said. "He's interesting to watch up on the stand. He gets this 
funny smile on his face, and he starts quoting from the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
Rickard last year faced two separate trials on sex charges stemming from a 
homosexual relationship that he allegedly engaged in for more than 2 1/2 years 
with a teen-ager. The youth was 15 when he moved out of his parents' Glendale 
home and traveled in Rickard's company to Northern California. He was 17 when 
he returned home and told his parents that he had been involved sexually with 
Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
Because the alleged relationship had occurred in two places, Redding 
authorities filed 110 charges of oral copulation with a minor, and Pasadena 
authorities filed 10. Both cases came to trial in 1989 and ended in hung 
juries, 9-3 for conviction in Redding and 11-1 in favor of conviction in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard has steadfastly maintained he is innocent. During the trials, 10 young 
men, formerly troubled youths whom Rickard counseled, testified on his behalf, 
saying they were never sexually approached by Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors are now preparing retrials. On Monday, a hearing is scheduled in 
Redding to set a trial date; Rickard's Pasadena retrial begins Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Before his legal troubles started, Rickard had moved frequently between 
Northern California and the San Gabriel Valley. Born and raised in Sierra 
Madre, he worked in area churches during the '70s, in Northern California in 
the early '80s, and by 1982, was back in the San Gabriel Valley, launching an 
anti-drug program called "Project Alert." 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, he moved back to Northern California accompanied by the youth who has 
since accused him. There, Rickard worked at a church and in group homes for 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
But since the charges were filed, he has given up the jobs in Northern 
California and moved back into his parents' home in Sierra Madre. He said he 
has racked up $90,000 in legal fees, and his parents have mortgaged their 
house. But he refuses to plea bargain, as was suggested by the judge in the 
Northern California case. 
</P>
<P>
"If I plea bargain, it's all over," said Rickard, who received degrees from Cal 
State LA and Pacific Oaks College, and attended the Melodyland School of 
Theology in Anaheim. "All my degrees are worthless, and I'm ruined for the rest 
of my life. I might as well be dead. I might as well be in the grave." 
</P>
<P>
But the family of the now-19-year-old remains equally firm. 
</P>
<P>
"We prayed about it, went to the pastor and decided that David worming his way 
into another family was never going to happen again," said the youth's father. 
"Obviously, David has led a Christian ministry, but he's got a flaw, and it's 
got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
The father and son requested that their names not be used because of the young 
man's age at the time of the alleged sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
The cases have caused some churchgoers from the San Fernando and San Gabriel 
valleys to take sides. Among those siding with Rickard are some members of the 
Episcopal Church of the Ascension in Sierra Madre, which Rickard attended as a 
child in the company of his parents, Jane and Ken, Sierra Madre residents since 
1949. Rickard, who said he got interested in a career as a minister after 
attending a prayer meeting with a friend in 1975, once served as a volunteer 
youth worker at Ascension. 
</P>
<P>
A few longtime Sierra Madre residents also support Rickard. Among them is Don 
Dewey, 57, publisher of R-C Modeler and Fresh Water and Marine Aquarium 
magazines. Dewey said Rickard belonged to a group of young people who conducted 
Bible study classes at the Dewey home in the early 1980s. When Dewey's son, 
Michael, died in a 1982 motorcycle crash, Rickard stayed the night at the 
hospital and helped the family through the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Dewey in turn aided Rickard in the pastor's unsuccessful 1982 bid for a Sierra 
Madre City Council seat. He also helped him launch Project Alert, an anti-drug 
program founded by Rickard in which Sierra Madre police dispatchers sent 
counselors to teens in need. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sierra Madre Police Chief Bill Betts now minimizes the department's 
affiliation with the program, Dewey and Rickard said the department officially 
sanctioned the project. 
</P>
<P>
Among those on the other side are members of St. Jude's Episcopal Church in 
Burbank. It was at St. Jude's that Rickard, a youth pastor, met the young man 
and his family in 1984. Despite reservations by older, more conservative church 
members who objected to Rickard's long hair, the young man and his parents came 
to regard the hip youth pastor as a member of the family, said the father. 
</P>
<P>
With his pet macaws, BMW automobile, good stereo system and ability to "talk 
the lingo" of teen-agers, Rickard made the church's youth program flourish. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a great deal of enthusiasm," the father said. "He had a charm and 
manner that drove teen-agers to him, especially teen-age boys." 
</P>
<P>
His son, then 14, began spending time with Rickard in Bible study sessions, the 
father said. When Rickard said he was moving to Northern California to work at 
the Little Country Church in Palo Cedro, the young man asked to go. 
</P>
<P>
The father said he consented to his son living away from home because of his 
trust in Rickard. 
</P>
<P>
Only when the youth returned in 1987 and was questioned by his mother did the 
family discover the true nature of the relationship, the father said. They 
called Rickard to their house and he confessed, pleading with them not to 
expose him, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard insists that he only admitted a physical attraction to the boy, who, 
with blond hair and blue eyes, looked enough like him to be his child. "The 
physical aspect came in that (the young man) looked like my son," said Rickard, 
who is unmarried and has no children. "It was more of an emotional bonding that 
had taken place." 
</P>
<P>
After the confrontation with Rickard, the family went to the police. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard, who said he has appeared on religious broadcasts on cable television 
in Northern California, has insisted that he is being persecuted by 
law-enforcement officials who view him as another Jim Bakker or Jimmy Swaggart. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors in Los Angeles and Shasta counties deny that, and they are 
determined to retry him. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's somebody in contact with lots of young people, and he abuses his 
position of trust," said Los Angeles Deputy District Atty. Robert de Carteret , 
the prosecutor in the Pasadena case. "The victim is not just a 15-year-old kid. 
The victim is everybody who sends their kid to church and the YMCA and those 
programs. They are all weakened by the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
The young man's parents also are determined, even though the retrials mean 
their son will have to take the stand against Rickard and give painful 
testimony for a third and fourth time. The youth, who received six months of 
counseling after he told his parents of the alleged sexual relationship, is now 
a college student with a grocery store job and a pregnant wife. 
</P>
<P>
"I really want to go on with my life," the young man said recently. "I'd really 
like to see this over." 
</P>
<P>
Rickard is likewise determined to fight the charges, rebuild his life and stay 
in youth counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"My commitment to families and people hasn't changed," he said. "That's my 
life. That's what I do."

HOTEL PLANNERS PLEASED BY IMPACT REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed luxury hotel for the site of the private Sand and Sea Club on Santa 
Monica beach would create air-quality problems during construction and add to 
traffic congestion on Pacific Coast Highway, according to a draft environmental 
impact report released recently for public comment. 
</P>
<P>
But the developers don't expect either problem to create a major roadblock for 
the 160-room hotel and community center proposed by restaurateur Michael 
McCarty, managing general partner of the Santa Monica Beach Development 
Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with it," McCarty said of the report. "This is great. You 
always hope you get something like this." 
</P>
<P>
Public comments on the two-volume, 770-page report -- which is available for 
review at the main branch library and at City Hall and for purchase at the 
Santa Monica Planning Department -- will be accepted by the Planning Department 
until Feb. 6. A final report, including responses to the public comments, is 
scheduled for release in late February or early March, according to Liz Casey, 
associate city planner. 
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to go before the Planning Commission in late March and 
then before the City Council in April. 
</P>
<P>
The project must also receive approval from the state Coastal Commission before 
construction can begin. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the developers obtain all the approvals, however, the project could be 
blocked by an initiative that will go before Santa Monica voters in November. 
If adopted by voters, the measure, designed to restrict hotel construction near 
the coast, would block McCarty's hotel unless construction is already in 
progress. A competing initiative that would exempt the project is also on the 
same city ballot. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty's proposal was selected by the city from among 11 received in 1987 in 
response to a call for proposals to develop the 4.9-acre parcel of beach 
property, which is owned by the state and managed by the city. The state and 
the city wanted a project that would generate at least $500,000 annually in 
revenues and increase public access to the site. 
</P>
<P>
The Sand and Sea Club has leased the site since the early 1960s and had been 
paying the city about $125,000 a year until recently, when the amount was 
doubled. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty's proposal guaranteed a minimum of $1 million a year in rent to the 
city and as much as $1.9 million in taxes -- a total of about $2.9 million per 
year after completion in 1993. The proposed hotel would have 160 rooms in a 
central building and a cluster of bungalows, each with a fireplace and private 
balcony or patio. There would also be two 200-seat restaurants, a 
5,646-square-foot conference center with six meeting rooms, a 8,555-square-foot 
banquet room and a 2,151-square-foot multipurpose room, which, for example, 
could be used by the Westside Arts Center for musical or theatrical 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
The project would include a community center complex, including public changing 
rooms and showers, a children's park, and an arts and environmental center. The 
three-story community center would incorporate the two-story Marion Davies 
North House, which has been designated as a historical landmark. It would be 
the only existing structure on the site that would be saved and would become 
part of the second and third floors of the community center. 
</P>
<P>
Two levels of subterranean parking would provide 527 spaces for hotel and 
public use. 
</P>
<P>
The project would generate 2,495 total vehicle trips per day on weekdays, and 
2,240 trips per day on summer weekends, numbers large enough to significantly 
aggravate congestion during peak hours, according to the report. The worst 
traffic effects would occur on the coast highway and on the California Incline 
leading up the Palisades Park bluffs, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
The report recommends installing a traffic signal on PCH at the entrance to the 
project as a way to lessen the impact. 
</P>
<P>
The report also recommends that the hotel building nearest to the coast highway 
be built so that it steps backs as the building height increases and that the 
main hotel building be broken up into three or four structures similar to the 
cluster of bungalows proposed along the beachfront of the project. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said both recommendations are acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>

BALDWIN PARK'S NEW MANAGER READY TO TACKLE BIG CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>
<P>
BALDWIN PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not all of Don Penman's friends think coming to Baldwin Park is the best move 
in the young administrator's career. 
</P>
<P>
The previous city manager resigned under fire last May. In his wake, five other 
top officials -- including the mayor, police chief and interim city manager -- 
have also departed. 
</P>
<P>
Morale has been low. Money is short. And any hope of quick relief was squelched 
in November when voters overwhelmingly rejected a proposed increase in the 
city's utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would you want to go there?" they asked Penman, 38, husband, father of 
two, Little League coach and Presbyterian church leader. "It's so unstable." 
</P>
<P>
But after seven years as city administrator of San Fernando, where he is 
credited with turning around a town that suffered many of the same problems 
nagging Baldwin Park today, Penman is ready to scale new heights. 
</P>
<P>
He is excited by the chance to manage a staff of 195 city employees, nearly 
double that of San Fernando. There are 63,000 residents, more than triple San 
Fernando's population. Yet there will be only $2.3 million in sales tax 
revenues to work with, not even close to the $3.1 million generated by the tiny 
community north of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hate to go through life backing away from those challenges," Penman 
said the other day in the trailer that has housed his office for the last two 
months while San Fernando City Hall is being remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the four remaining members of the Baldwin Park City Council voted 
unanimously to give him the chance after a sometimes frustrating seven-month 
search, during which several interim candidates declined the job. Penman will 
take over as city manager Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
He will earn $86,500 a year, about $10,000 more than his current salary. He 
will also receive a city-owned car, equipped with a cellular phone, to make the 
40-plus-mile commute from his San Fernando Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
"If he's the type of person who enjoys a challenge," said Mayor Pro Tem Bette 
Lowes, "we can certainly provide it." 
</P>
<P>
If he can do for Baldwin Park anything even close to what he's credited with 
having accomplished in San Fernando, he'll be the town hero. 
</P>
<P>
It's widely agreed that San Fernando was in a sorry state before Penman was 
named administrator in 1982. The San Fernando Redevelopment Agency had just 
lost $700,000 due to sloppy paper work, Penman recalled. And over the previous 
three years, the city had been forced to use $1 million from its reserves to 
balance the budget, leaving only $300,000 in emergency cash. 
</P>
<P>
"He had his work cut out for him," said San Fernando Mayor Daniel Acuna. "There 
was a total lack of leadership. City Hall was in such a sad state." 
</P>
<P>
Penman, who graduated from USC in 1975 with a master's degree in public 
administration and had served as deputy city manager in Simi Valley, set out to 
clean house. 
</P>
<P>
He got rid of several part-time department heads and replaced them with 
permanent staff members. He bought new computers. And he tossed out the 
antiquated telephones the city had been leasing and bought a modern system. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of that was just sound management," Penman said. "It didn't require a 
lot of genius." 
</P>
<P>
Then he launched the most ambitious redevelopment effort in the city's history. 
Like Baldwin Park, San Fernando had grown into a predominantly Latino 
community. Per capita income was falling. And the big stores that had been in 
town for years started heading west toward more affluent suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Penman negotiated a deal that brought a Pace Membership warehouse and a Home 
Depot to the site of the old San Fernando airport. A Jeep dealership came to 
town. An industrial park opened. Plans for a new Tianguis store, part of the 
Mexican supermarket chain owned by Vons, are now in the works. 
</P>
<P>
With the sales tax revenues rolling in, a new senior center was built at one of 
the city parks. A new police station was constructed. City Hall is being 
renovated. And a new public library is slated to be built on the old police 
station site. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the first professional city administrator we had," said Councilman 
James Hansen, who counts 41 separate projects completed or under way during 
Penman's tenure. "If he had chosen the private sector, he would have been the 
president of a company somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, no one in city government seems to have a word to say against Penman, 
a trim, athletic man with a hint of red in his hair inherited from his Scottish 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jess Margarito, who believes Penman has served the city well, 
complains only that redevelopment sometimes came at the expense of human 
services and housing. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very fair and interacts well with people of all persuasions," Margarito 
said. "But he's been a little slow to respond to quality-of-life-type issues. 
He should have been a little more proactive in helping to envision answers for 
some of our deteriorating neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, as others in the community point out, there was such disarray when Penman 
came on board that the basic building blocks of the city needed to be put in 
place before other problems could be handled. 
</P>
<P>
"He had to set the stage first," said Jose Hernandez, a city planning 
commissioner and professor of urban studies at Cal State Northridge. "You have 
to have a strong economic base before you can move into the area of social 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
Penman sees parallels between the San Fernando of the early 1980s and the 
Baldwin Park of today. And for all the turmoil that has rocked his new city, he 
is confident of being able to bring about some of the same changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite all the uncertainty, I think the council really wants to put that 
behind them and move ahead," he said. "I have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. 
If that's what the council's looking for, that's what they're going to get."

WOMEN SOUGHT FOR OSTEOPOROSIS STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Osteoporosis Medical Center, a nonprofit research, diagnostic and treatment 
facility in Beverly Hills, is seeking women to participate in a national study 
of the effectiveness of calcitonin nasal spray in preventing osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which is being conducted in conjunction with UCLA Medical Center, 
will look at how effective calcitonin in nasal spray form is in preventing bone 
loss in the spine, hips and other parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier studies in England have shown the spray to prevent loss of bone density 
in the spine. Calcitonin has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for use in injectable form. 
</P>
<P>
Center physician Stuart Silverman explained that estrogen is known to protect 
against bone density loss after menopause, but that estrogen presents problems 
for some women. He said that up to one-third of women do not respond to 
estrogen therapy. Others should not take estrogen because of health problems, 
including ovarian cancer, fibrocystic disease and other conditions. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible to take part in the study, volunteers need to have reached 
menopause within the past five years. Interested women may visit the center, at 
450 North Bedford Drive, or call (213) 274-0111.

HOW TO HANDLE FORECLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Frieda and Joe Saunders were sure everything was going to turn out all right. 
</P>
<P>
They had come so far -- buying their first home in Baldwin Hills, having their 
first child. 
</P>
<P>
But after the baby came and Frieda quit her job, it seemed like the mail was 
always full of bills. They were using their credit card to pay for essentials. 
</P>
<P>
When it looked like they were going to have trouble making their mortgage 
payment, they applied to a loan company for a second mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Certain they would get the loan, they didn't worry about not making their house 
payment, thinking that the money would come through for them soon. 
</P>
<P>
But when the loan was denied, they were thrown into confusion. Soon they 
received a notice of default, the first legal step in the process of 
foreclosure on their home. 
</P>
<P>
The Saunderses, like many others in their situation, didn't know where to turn 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
This is a story about what you can do if you are facing foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Los Angeles County recorder's office, the number of people in 
danger of default and foreclosure has been declining, but it still is 
substantial. 
</P>
<P>
The downward trend in foreclosures has several causes, according to a number of 
lenders, lawyers and real estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
Homes in California have appreciated tremendously and interest rates have 
dropped, so alternative financing is more readily available, and there are 
plenty of speculators eager to buy distressed properties. But with an uncertain 
economy and the soft housing market, this trend could change. 
</P>
<P>
Many homeowners who get in trouble with their mortgages have a common reaction 
to their situation -- shame and denial, experts say. (The names of those facing 
foreclosure who were interviewed for this article have been changed by 
request.) 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they get notifications in the mail that they don't even open. They 
may get scared and panic and wait until the last minute to look for help, 
losing a lot of advantages they had when time was not against them. 
</P>
<P>
Frieda and Joe Saunders were lucky. The loan company that denied their 
application suggested that they contact the nonprofit Consumer Credit 
Counselors at (213) 386-7601, which provides free financial counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumer Credit looked at all of our bills," Frieda Saunders explained. "We 
had so many different accounts and everything was way behind. They looked at 
our income and helped us decide what we needed to live on and what we could 
afford to pay. 
</P>
<P>
"Then we made one payment to them each month and they divided it up among our 
creditors, along with a letter explaining our situation. It took us six months' 
working to catch up, but we made it. And we learned a lot. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Credit is affiliated with the National Foundation for Consumer Credit 
in Silver Springs, Md., which was founded in 1951. The Los Angeles chapter, 
with nine offices in the area, was opened in 1966. About 800 people come for 
counseling each month. 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit organization receives finances from local businesses, 
HUD-certified grants and foundations. Executive Director Gary Stroth explained 
how the agency works: 
</P>
<P>
"We sit down with the clients and figure out their monthly living expenses, 
mortgage, food, laundry, etc.," Stroth said. 
</P>
<P>
"We look at their bills and try to see what they can afford to live on and 
still pay off their debts. Since we have a good relationship with the credit 
community, we can often work out a package both parties will benefit by. 
</P>
<P>
"The standard fee for us to act as a trustee is 6% of the amount disbursed, or 
up to $20 a month. This service is free to people with FHA mortgages and 
Section 8 renters." 
</P>
<P>
There are other services offering help to those facing foreclosure. In the San 
Fernando Valley, you can call Better Valley Services at (818) 988-5059; in 
South-Central Los Angeles, Community Care and Development Services at (213) 
234-1937, and Westminster Neighborhood Assn. Inc. at (213) 564-6781. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer credit counselors often are recommended by lenders concerned about 
mortgages in default. Banks do not like to foreclose on homes, said Matthew E. 
Graham, vice president of loan services for California Federal. 
</P>
<P>
"We much prefer the customer to work with us," Graham said. "The typical 
customer reaction is embarrassment, but we encourage our customers to contact 
us as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"Our business committee will review individual cases based on documentation 
substantiating tenuating circumstances. There can be moratoriums on late 
charges, modifications of original terms of the loan. Late payments and 
delinquent property taxes can be added to the principal and amortized. 
</P>
<P>
"For example, when some of our customers in Whittier experienced problems after 
the earthquake, we worked with them so they could keep their records clean by 
placing moratoriums on their late charges." 
</P>
<P>
Through counseling or independent research, people in financial difficulties 
can find various ways of avoiding foreclosure -- by refinancing, getting an 
additional mortgage, selling the property or declaring bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
When applying for an additional mortgage, acting quickly is critical because of 
the fees that start accruing once the foreclosure process begins. Getting good 
terms on an additional mortgage is a lot easier if you apply for it before 
mortgage payments are late or have been skipped. 
</P>
<P>
Many investment firms are able to get as much 19% interest for second mortgages 
because homeowners have waited until just before their foreclosure sale to 
apply for a loan. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, taking on another loan doesn't work magic. It still means a 
redirecting of budget. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes homeowners don't realize how serious their financial problems are and 
have to take very severe measure, such as declaring bankruptcy, to remedy their 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Once bankruptcy has been declared, all foreclosure proceedings are halted by 
the bankruptcy judge. An appeal may be made to the court to allow the property 
to be refinanced or sold, even listed with a real estate agent calling for full 
market value, if grounds can be shown that the lenders will not be hurt by 
waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy does stay on your credit rating for nine years, so it is a 
last-resort solution. Again, if financial problems arise, it pays to see a 
counselor before the problem is unmanageable. 
</P>
<P>
Some homeowners may decide that selling their house is the best way to resolve 
their money problems. This is especially true when there is very little equity 
in the property. 
</P>
<P>
If contacted in time, a real estate agent can help assure the homeowner of 
getting as close to full market value, based on comparative houses in the area, 
taking the liens on the house into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
There are also individuals who approach homeowners in default by mail or 
telephone, offering to help. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as I got my notice of default, I got four or five letters a week and 
phone calls from people who said they'd let me get out from under my problems," 
said Bill, a construction worker who lived in Huntington Beach. He had bad 
credit, was heavily in debt and had little equity in his house. 
</P>
<P>
"Finally, I got so desperate that I picked a guy that looked sincere and sat 
down with him and worked it out. He paid off my mortgages, the state income 
tax, brought the payments up to date and gave me $2,500 to walk away with. 
</P>
<P>
"He fixed up the house, and three or four months later, turned around and sold 
it. I know he made a profit, but I didn't see any way else I could have handled 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing was that I didn't end up with a judgment on my record from a 
foreclosure sale." 
</P>
<P>
Bill made his decision under great pressure and on instinct rather than 
information. He may not have had any other choice, given his situation. But 
it's crucial to get ahead of such problems. The sooner a homeowner recognizes 
that he or she is facing foreclosure and seeks help, the better.

PARTNERING: WITH HIGHER PRICES, MORE LISTINGS AND DEMAND FOR SERVICES, IT PAYS 
MORE AGENTS TO SPLIT THE WORK.

<P>
A doctor and his wife had filed for divorce, but continued to live in their 
Beverly Hills mansion, the wife in one wing, the husband in the other, while 
the house was up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Listing agent Bobbie McCall of Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young, who got along 
better with the wife, recalled, "If I got lucky and the husband wasn't there, I 
could show the whole house, but if he was there, I could only show her side." 
</P>
<P>
McCall tried to get the estranged couple to reach a compromise, but they 
wouldn't talk to each other. "I was caught in the middle," McCall said, so she 
turned for help to her "partner" in the office, September Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easier for me to work with the husband," Kimble recalled. "So I showed 
his side of the house and Bobbie showed the wife's." 
</P>
<P>
When an offer came in, Kimble went to one restaurant for the doctor's 
signature, while McCall went to another restaurant for the wife's. "And we made 
the deal," Kimble said. 
</P>
<P>
For partners Kimble and McCall, who have worked together for the past eight 
years on 80% of their transactions, this was another example of "partnering" 
paying off. 
</P>
<P>
Partnering, the teaming up of two or more agents or brokers, is a growing 
phenomenon in the residential real estate business of Southern California, 
particularly in the high-end markets. 
</P>
<P>
Among the reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- With a slowdown of the market, there are more listings to be serviced. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sellers, especially of luxury homes, are demanding more service. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An increased number of real estate documents and threatened lawsuits have 
made it difficult for an individual realtor to handle the workload. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Escalating crime has made it unsafe to be on some streets alone at night, 
some women agents point out. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most important reason that partnering has increased sharply in 
recent years is that high Southland prices have made commission splits more 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
There are two types of partnering. 
</P>
<P>
One is the classic variety. Partners do most or all of their business together, 
pooling work and dividing profits 50/50, like Debra Berman and Pat Kandel, who 
sold $50 million in homes last year at Jon Douglas Co.'s Marina del Rey office. 
</P>
<P>
The other is a joint-venture type arrangement in which partners team up on a 
deal-by-deal basis, like Joyce Rey, who has, by her own count, nearly 10 
partners on separate 50/50 deals at any given time. Rey is co-founder and 
general manager of Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills, which only handles 
$1-million-and-more homes. 
</P>
<P>
Commissions on the sale of such houses are big enough for each partner to take 
home a sizable sum. A top agent who is a 50/50 listing partner would make, for 
example, about $35,000 on a $4-million deal. 
</P>
<P>
The full commission probably would be 5%, or $200,000, and that would be 
divided 50/50 between selling and listing agents. Of their $100,000, the 
listing partners would get 70%, or $35,000 each, and the listing brokerage firm 
would get 30% for phone, advertising and other expenses. Real estate companies 
generally get 50% from agents who are not top producers. 
</P>
<P>
But even a top producer selling nothing but expensive homes could fail when it 
comes to partnering, because there are other factors besides high prices and 
commissions that make it work. 
</P>
<P>
A big factor is volume. Because the commission is split, the sales and listings 
volume of each partner should be as high or higher than it was before the 
partnership was formed, said Perry Cross, who has been partnering for 10 years 
with his wife, Anne, at Jon Douglas Co.'s Studio City office. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Alley, who has partnered with Patty Chiarodit at Ramsey-Shilling in 
Toluca Lake for three years, said, "Because we're partners, we have to double 
our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Berman and Kandel each came into their partnership five years ago with 15 
listings, and since then, they've maintained an average of 30. 
</P>
<P>
"Our income has definitely increased because of partnering," Kandel said, "but 
I don't think partnering is for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
As Jack Sammons of Fred Sands Realtors, Sherman Oaks, explained it, "I had a 
partner for three years, but I fired her, because I was doing all the work." 
</P>
<P>
Another drawback: "You can lose your identity," Kandel said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her partner heavily promote the entity Berman-Kandel, and clients often 
mistake one of them for the other. But it amused them when they got some 
correspondence addressed to Mr. Berman Kandel. 
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, brokers felt 
</P>
<P>
partnerships were not a successful pattern," said Jon Douglas Co. General 
Manager Lou Piatt, "because we thought of them as two people trying to cut down 
on effort by sharing the work, so the productivity of one would be divided by 
two. 
</P>
<P>
"But we have several extraordinary partnerships now where people . . . are 
</P>
<P>
far more successful than they were individually. Success has to do with the 
chemistry of the relationship and the commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Berman and Kandel stress this in seminars that they give regularly. They spoke 
at the National Assn. of Realtors convention in Dallas in November and before a 
group of 1,000 real estate agents in San Francisco last May. 
</P>
<P>
"Partnering is definitely a trend," Kandel said. "There is a lot of interest in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of people partner for the wrong reasons," Berman added. "Some just 
want to take more time off." 
</P>
<P>
A partner can take off more time without worries, knowing that there is another 
agent or broker who is just as involved in a deal, Kandel said, "but both 
partners must be willing to work equally hard and do such unglamorous jobs as 
putting up "For Sale" signs and knocking on doors. 
</P>
<P>
"And a partner shouldn't be brand-new to the business," said Kandel, who had 
sold homes for 11 years before teaming with Berman, who was equally 
experienced. "People should be able to hold their own without using a partner 
as a crutch." 
</P>
<P>
But, ironically, that's how the idea began. 
</P>
<P>
Partnering started in the late 1960s with a summer program for junior brokers 
at Coldwell Banker Commercial Real Estate in Los Angeles, said Jay Haskell, who 
worked for Coldwell Banker at the time but is now president of the Seeley Co. 
</P>
<P>
The program placed a junior broker, called "a rookie" or "a runner," under the 
tutelage of a senior broker. After a year of training, the rookie could earn 
commissions, splitting them with the senior broker. Until then, the rookie was 
paid a minimum salary. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Rader, executive vice president of the Klabin Co., an Inglewood-based 
commercial real estate firm, said, "The first time I was a partner on a 
transaction was with a senior broker in our office. I did all the grunt work 
like ordering signs and mailers, but when it came down to the fine points of 
the deal, the senior partner negotiated it. 
</P>
<P>
"We called it an 80/20/50 split; I did 80% of the work, he did 20%, and we 
split the commission 50/50, but I wouldn't have had access to such a big deal 
without the senior partner." 
</P>
<P>
The same process goes on in residential real estate offices, where partnering 
began as a "mentor program" years after it started in commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Cecelia Waeschle of Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills said, "When I first got my 
real estate license in 1980, I gave up half of any commissions I would earn to 
work in a mentor program in Beverly Hills, but I got incredible training." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent deal as a partner with Joyce Rey, Waeschle proved true one of the 
lessons she learned in that training. It was, she said, that "there is no free 
ride in partnering: If you don't get the client, you must put in the hours." 
</P>
<P>
By going into the office on Labor Day, Waeschle found a house for some buyers 
whom Rey had obtained as clients. "Partners should be willing to go the extra 
mile," Waeschle said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena realtor Jane Caughey, who has been partnering for nearly five years 
with Kelly Brock at Podley, Caughey &amp; Done, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do nearly as much business on my own as with a partner, because 
we're both willing to go the extra mile," she said, "and with so many listings 
now, four legs are better than two." 
</P>
<P>
With a slowdown in the market, there has been an increase in listings and a 
longer period for homes to sell, resulting in a greater demand for service. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Merrill, regional president of the Prudential California Realty, cited the 
"buildup of inventory" as a reason for the growth of partnering, which he 
claims is more common in high-priced areas of Southern California than anywhere 
else in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"The closer you get to Brentwood, Bel-Air and Beverly Hills, the more 
partnering you see," he said, estimating that 30% to 50% of the deals in those 
communities are partnered. 
</P>
<P>
The higher the selling price, the more practical it is to split the commission, 
noted several partners, though some -- like Darlene Todorvich and Margaret 
Hathaway at Century 21/The Lidle Co. in Covina -- sell some homes priced at 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
Most Southland home prices are well above the national average, however, and 
that is why competition among realtors here is keen. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the prices, agents go into listings with as much talent as 
possible," Merrill said. "A high producer will team with a superstar agent 
because the high producer realizes that the competition also includes a 
superstar. 
</P>
<P>
"But another factor is that some of our better agents are so busy that they 
will partner to spread the work around. With more listings, our best agents are 
busier satisfying customers than before. For the past 18 months, listings 
weren't on the market that long, so the amount of service was less." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers of high-priced homes expect more service anyway, said James R. Gary, 
owner/broker of a Woodland Hills-based realty firm who does joint-venture deals 
with two partners. 
</P>
<P>
"A movie or TV executive in Calabasas Park is going to expect an agent to 
provide services that are more commensurate with the price of his property. So 
the agent is going to do a whole lot more for his money, like hold more open 
houses and do more advertising," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Listing agents of luxury houses, from the San Fernando Valley to San Marino to 
Tustin, are expected to be present for every showing, he said, "and oftentimes, 
this requirement is put into writing." 
</P>
<P>
The listing agent's presence is required, high-end realtors say, to demonstrate 
features, be a buffer between the seller and potential buyer and/or buyer's 
agent, protect valuables and prepare the house for showings. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't just let a potential buyer's agent loose in a 10,000-square-foot 
house," Gary remarked. 
</P>
<P>
It took him an hour every time he prepared to show a $3-million Calabasas 
house, which was about that size. "I would prepare the staff, open the drapes, 
turn on the lights and fountains," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary also says that partners can help each other process the many real estate 
documents. "Over the past 10 years, we've seen an exponential increase in paper 
work with every sale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Hug of the George Elkins Co. in Newport Beach agreed: "The amount of paper 
work needed to put together a deal is 95% greater than it was when I left real 
estate in 1982. That's one reason I got together with Linda." 
</P>
<P>
Impressed with Hug's energy and experience, Linda Taglianetti, a 13-year 
veteran in selling houses, persuaded Hug to leave retirement four months ago to 
become a 50/50 partner, though Hug had worked mainly on her own for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like details," Hug said. "I like negotiating and showing, but Linda is 
like an attorney. She knows the documents inside and out." In these litigious 
times, Hug conceded, she is more confident having Taglianetti as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
"It is also safer to have a partner if you have to go out at night," said 
Covina agent Margaret Hathaway, who has teamed with Darlene Todorvich for five 
years. "I think there are more partners now because of the safety factor." 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Hills agent Bobbie McCall remembers waiting until 2 a.m. for a client 
to get back from a party to sign a deal. "I wouldn't want to do that alone," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Berman recalls completing three transactions one night, with the last 
appointment starting at 10 p.m. "Partnering made it so much easier," she said. 
"We called our husbands, and they felt . . . we were safe because we were 
together." 
</P>
<P>
"There are some scary times when I'm glad to have my partner with me," said 
Nadine Bartholomew, who teams with Nancy Short at Turner &amp; Associates in 
Laguna Beach. "Like today, when we knocked on a door (for a listing) and this 
kooky fellow invited us in. I'd never knock on a door alone." 
</P>
<P>
Bartholomew and Short have been partners for 18 months, but they have been 
friends for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Helm and Virginia Johnson, who work at Mike Glickman Realty in Sherman 
Oaks, also have been friends longer than they've been partners, and they have 
much in common. Both are mothers with several grown children. 
</P>
<P>
Helm and Johnson also have differences, however, which they have learned to use 
to their advantage in partnering. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody loves Virginia," Helm said of her partner of 12 years. "She's sort 
of a mother image. So when there is something tough to do, like reduce a 
client's price, I have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
"Alice is good at that," Johnson observed. 
</P>
<P>
When Bartholomew and Short go to get a listing together, they see "who relates 
better with the client," Bartholomew said. "Inevitably, one of us gets along 
better, so the client has a choice." Clients then work more with one of the 
partners than the other. 
</P>
<P>
As Sandy Khadar of Hanu Reddy in Irvine, who isn't partnering now but did for 
three years, explained: "If you don't have a personality that fits a client, 
you can have the client work with the other partner." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Bibb, who works on a deal-by-deal basis with Stefanie Grody or Stella 
Shirar at Grubb &amp; Ellis in Newport Beach, said, "With us you have a choice 
of working with a man or a woman, and that's ideal, because males and females 
may have different perspectives." 
</P>
<P>
"Some clients relate better to a man, others to a woman," said Joe Babajian, 
who has joint-venture partnered with Judy Cycon for nine years at Fred Sands 
Estates in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
"Kathleen's strengths are my weaknesses," is the way Dorothy St. Amour 
described her 14-year partnership with her sister, Kathleen Van Sant-Fisher of 
Rancho Santa Fe Properties in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"But we approach business the same way," Van Sant-Fisher quickly added. "We 
both enjoy working hard, we're enthusiastic and have a sense of fair play." 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena realtor Kaughey said, "Partners, especially those who split the work 
and profits 50/50, need to be simpatico in their approach." 
</P>
<P>
And they often think alike, said Rose Borne, who has been a 50/50 partner with 
Marilyn Nelson for five years at Stan Herman &amp; Associates in Beverly Hills.

HOT PROPERTY: ENGELBERT TO SELL HIS 'PINK PALACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The King of Romance is selling his "Pink Palace." 
</P>
<P>
Singer ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK has listed the Holmby Hills home, once owned by 
the late movie star JAYNE MANSFIELD, at $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-bedroom, nine-bath mansion on 1.25 acres became known as the "Pink 
Palace" after the platinum-blond actress painted it her trademark color in the 
'60s. Humperdinck recently repainted it a bright pink. 
</P>
<P>
The singer has owned the three-story, Spanish-style estate, with an elevator 
and seven fireplaces, since 1976. He bought it from a spinster who lived mainly 
in a back room of the nearly 10,000-square-foot home, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
"Engelbert doesn't use the giant house so much anymore and plans to purchase a 
smaller property . . . that is closer to the beach," said Richard Schwartz, who 
shares the listing with Linda Linn at the Prudential California Realty's 
Sherman Oaks office. 
</P>
<P>
Humperdinck, his wife and their four children have divided their time between 
their homes in England, their main residence; Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Hawaii 
and Holmby Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Holmby house was built in the 1930s for a Texas oilman, Schwartz said, and 
it was later owned by singer Rudy Vallee. It was best known, however, for being 
Mansfield's home until she was killed in a car accident in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
While she lived there with her husband, Hollywood muscleman Mickey Hargitay, 
Mansfield not only painted the house but also built meandering walkways, ponds, 
fountains, statues and a heart-shaped swimming pool. Hargitay wrote "I love you 
Jaynie" on the bottom of the pool, according to the 1988 book "Sexbomb: The 
Life and Death of Jayne Mansfield." 
</P>
<P>
The inscription is gone, Schwartz said. "It was painted over, but something 
like 'Jaynie, my love will flame for you always. Love, Mickey' remains on the 
bronze hood over the firepit in the pool house." Mansfield's initials also 
remain in the wrought-iron gates facing Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"There's also supposed to be a hidden wall in the house with Jayne's magazine 
covers, which had been framed," Schwartz said. "We believe that wall is behind 
a newer wall covered with Engelbert's Platinum and Gold records." 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas" oilman Bobby Ewing has been house hunting on the CBS-TV show, but the 
house he actually finds is about 1,200 miles, as the crow flies, from Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The house that was used for the set is a new home in Calabasas Park Estates. 
Built by Coastal Development, the home has four bedrooms plus maid's quarters, 
a swimming pool, spa and views of the community golf course and tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what he is supposed to be paying for it in 'Dallas,' " said 
Michele Kantor of Fred Sands Realtors, "but the reality is that it is priced at 
$1,195,000." It's listed with Barbara Lipkin and Wendy Gale, both with Sands' 
office in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Ewing, played by PATRICK DUFFY, also gets romantically involved with a 
real estate woman in the segment, due to air, according to CBS, Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
PIA ZADORA is at it again, but this time she's selling, not buying. 
</P>
<P>
This column reported in early November that the entertainer and her wealthy 
husband, Meshulam Riklis, were about to move into their new, $6.7-million house 
in Beverly Park Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Their new house is near Pickfair, which they also own and where they were 
starting a two-year renovation/expansion. 
</P>
<P>
They were also building a house in Malibu Colony, near an older home that they 
also own, and they were redecorating their apartment in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
That's the background, now to the news: 
</P>
<P>
The couple is selling the Beverly Hills house where they lived before moving 
into Beverly Park Estates. This house was previously owned by jockey Bill 
Shoemaker. Before the Shoe, it was owned by Jeannie Martin, singer Dean 
Martin's former wife. 
</P>
<P>
Listed at $5.5 million with Beverly Hills realtor Mike Silverman, the one-story 
contemporary has a skylight entry and larger-than-usual glass doors looking out 
at treetop and city views; a gym, breakfast room, swimming pool, spa and 
sunken, lighted tennis court. There is also a two-story staff or guest house 
with four separate suites. 
</P>
<P>
A. J. CAROTHERS -- who co-wrote the 1987 movie "The Secret of My Success," 
starring Michael J. Fox, and is working on a sequel -- and his wife, Caryl, are 
buying a 4,320-square-foot home in the Haseko-Wilson project known as Crown 
Villas at MountainGate in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
The couple is moving from another Brentwood residence into the new $1,085,000 
home as soon as interiors are completed. 
</P>
<P>
The Carotherses also talked their good friends, Bill and Joyce Asher, into 
buying at Crown Villas. All of their homes are due to close escrow the first 
week of February. 
</P>
<P>
BILL ASHER, who produced the TV series "Betwitched" and directed most of the "I 
Love Lucy" episodes, and his wife, Joyce, are moving into their new $1,225,000 
home from a Malibu home valued in the $2.5-million to $3-million range. 
</P>
<P>
"So they're moving down," said developer Ken Wilson with a chuckle, "but they 
like the views from Crown Villas overlooking Benedict Canyon, and the project 
is right next to the tennis courts." 
</P>
<P>
Security aspects of the 870-acre MountainGate, a planned community, also 
appealed to the Ashers, who have been doing considerable traveling. She was 
just in Madrid on a fund-raising tour as executive vice president for a 
national dyslexia research organization, while he has been flying back and 
forth to New York, working on a pilot for a series. 
</P>
<P>
A West Hollywood triplex that singer FRANK SINATRA owned in the '50s and 
MARILYN MONROE called home from 1952 to 1954 has been sold to actor JAMES 
COBURN's ex-wife, Beverly Coburn, who plans to live there. 
</P>
<P>
Interior designer Kalef Alaton, who died last May, was the most recent owner. 
He turned the triplex into a 7,000-square-foot townhouse, which Coburn bought 
for about $1.7 million. She sold her Moorish-style, 40-room villa in Beverly 
Hills to the SULTAN of BRUNEI in April, 1988, for $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Levine at Asher Dann &amp; Associates represented Coburn, and Linda May 
of Caverhill &amp; May represented Alaton's estate.

APARTMENT LIFE: OPTIONS FOR SEPARATING COUPLE BOUND BY LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN B. POSTEMA, Postema is editor of Apartment Age Magazine, a publication 
of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' service 
group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: One of your recent Apartment Life columns contained a question 
entitled "Splitting Couple Must Honor Lease." The Los Angeles writer and her 
husband had signed a one-year lease. Now they are splitting up and she wants to 
move out. Her husband says he will take her to court if she does not continue 
paying her portion of the rent for the lease term. 
</P>
<P>
In my opinion, a practical solution might be to approach her landlord with her 
problem to see if he might release her from the lease or change it to a 
month-to-month rental agreement. Such a solution is not inconceivable in many 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
Another solution might be to sublease the apartment if her husband is willing 
to move out also or sublease to a new roommate. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, unless her husband pays the full rent during the lease term, and they 
are jointly and severally liable for the rent, the landlord is the one who 
would take her to court for the rent, not the husband. Isn't that right? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Your suggestions to alter the terms of the lease of sublease the 
apartment are good options, assuming the husband and/or landlord are willing to 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming they won't cooperate, let's consider the court options. If the rent is 
unpaid or only partially paid, the landlord could take either or both tenants 
to court. If all of the rent is paid by the husband, and none by the wife, or 
vice-versa, the landlord would take no one to court. The party paying the rent 
(the husband in this situation), could, without a lot of fuss or fanfare, take 
his spouse to Small Claims Court for her share of unpaid rent up to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rules for Renting Rooms in Your Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am the owner of a single-family residence in Los Angeles. I have two 
roommates who have full use of all the facilities, and I have a few questions. 
</P>
<P>
What are their rights as tenants? Can I raise the rents? If yes, with how much 
notice? Can I request that they pay a portion of the utilities? And, finally, I 
do not claim this as income or claim the expenses on my income tax returns. Is 
that OK? 
</P>
<P>
A: While your "roommates" have some rights, they don't have as many as renters 
who are covered by Los Angeles' rent control law (single-family homes are 
exempted from the law). 
</P>
<P>
Their basic rights include the following: the right to live in a habitable 
dwelling (which is usually not a problem when the owner lives on the premises); 
the right to quiet enjoyment of the premises (unless, say, they know when they 
move in that you are a rock musician who practices at home), and the right to 
reasonable notices of your intent to raise the rent or change any other tenancy 
terms or ask them to move out. The length of the notice is usually the same as 
the rental period, not exceeding one month. 
</P>
<P>
As for the utilities, you may require them to share in their payment, but give 
them legal notice of your intention. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, you ask if it's OK not to report the income (no) or expenses (yes, 
though illogical) on your taxes. If your tax man is reading this, he's probably 
reaching for the Alka Seltzer about now. If you don't have a tax man, you'll 
need one. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that you also get to itemize some expenses on your taxes that 
are unavailable to you as a homeowner, depreciation of some portion of the home 
being the biggest such expense. check with your tax man for the details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advantages of Tenant Ownership Plan 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica. It was recently sold 
and the new owners are trying to persuade the tenants to agree to participate 
in a Tenants' Ownership Rights Charter Amendment (TORCA). Under TORCA, a tenant 
gets a two-year option to buy his rental unit. What are the dangers and 
advantages of this plan? 
</P>
<P>
A: Jim Kemper, an information coordinator for the Santa Monica Rent Control 
Board, didn't cite any dangers in the plan. He said, "Normally, we just provide 
information on the rent-control law. It (TORCA) was an amendment to the city 
charter that was enacted in a similar way as the rent law was by a majority of 
the people. But it's actually administered by the city's Planning and Zoning 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
"The units will always be rent-controlled. It was simply envisioned as a plan 
that allows tenants to purchase their units, but the tenants will always be 
protected. They still have a lifetime lease." 
</P>
<P>
One of the plan's creators, James W. Baker, a longtime Santa Monica political 
activist and past president of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, said 
there are many advantages to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said, "TORCA was negotiated by owner and renter leaders and approved by 
over two-thirds of the city's voters in June of 1984. It represents the closest 
thing I know of to a win-win scenario in politics." 
</P>
<P>
"The chief renter benefits include the following: Each renter who wants one is 
given a two-year option to buy his unit at a preferential price, but is under 
no obligation to do so. The options may be sold at a profit during the two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Renters not wishing options, may get long-term leases, lifetime leases for 
seniors and five-year leases for others, which provide that even without rent 
control, the amount they pay may not increase annually at much more than the 
inflation rate. There are many other renter benefits. Check with the city 
planning department and the owner for them. 
</P>
<P>
"The only disadvantage to renters is that should they decide to rent the unit 
out later, it will rent for the rent control rate," Baker said.

LORE OF THE ROSES FOR VENTURESOME GARDENERS; 
</P>
<P>
FLOWERS: PLAYBOY AND REGENSBERG, ON COMMERCIAL MARKET THIS WINTER, WILL THRIVE 
IN COASTAL AND INLAND CLIMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON VAN ENOO, Van Enoo is a Torrance free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
The AARS (the All-American Rose Selection) winner for 1990 is a floribunda and 
will be sold under the name Pleasure. Pleasure, like many other AARS winners of 
recent years is a nice salmon pink, ruffle petaled, cluster rose with excellent 
disease resistance. This may be its most distinguishing characteristic. 
</P>
<P>
The young (or young-at-heart) gardeners of today have been searching out new 
and unusual plants to create more exciting and interesting landscapes. They are 
expressing concern in having most of their plants, in particular their roses, 
looking just like everyone else's. In other words, the new gardener has begun 
to seek out opportunities to march to a different drummer but Pleasure is the 
same old song. 
</P>
<P>
Well, if you are one of these adventuresome maybe you would be more interested 
in two other beautiful, but unusual floribundas that will be on the commercial 
market this winter; they are Playboy, a rose hybridized by the Scot, Alec 
Cocker, and Regensberg, a "hand-painted" rose by the New Zealand hybridizer, 
Sam McGredy. 
</P>
<P>
These roses will grow extremely well in California, both inland and on the 
coast. They are truly unique, a delight to behold and a pleasure to grow. I 
have been growing both of these roses for the last three to four years in my 
own garden in the south part of Torrance, and I do recommend highly both 
Playboy and Regensberg for their charmingly atypical qualities. 
</P>
<P>
Playboy, is a ruffled, bright-orange semi-double (7 to 10 petals) rose with a 
brilliant yellow "eye" surrounding the stamens. The flowers bleed into scarlet 
red before dropping cleanly off the bush. This rose blooms in clusters, with 
flowers of every stage vying for attention. The clusters are framed in luscious 
dark-green foliage that is extremely disease-resistant, especially against 
mildew. The bush itself grows with an open airiness to about 4 1/2 to 5 feet. 
Its rounded appearance is achieved because it blooms on all sides of the bush. 
</P>
<P>
I have been growing two bushes of Playboy for about four years now. They sit on 
each side of an arbor that is the entrance to the largest of my raised flower 
beds in the back of my garden where the act as "anchor" roses to the other 
plants and flowers in this bed. 
</P>
<P>
Playboy is a wonderful rose in flower arrangements where it acts as a color 
bridge for the golds, oranges and reds of autumn. Since Playboy can be counted 
on for fall blooms it makes a perfect addition to Thanksgiving table 
decorations. Playboy's lovely foliage and constant bloom make it the last rose 
to be pruned in January. (Playboy does not go willingly into dormancy, so it 
makes me feel miserable when I have to cut off spanking new buds and blooms.) 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Regensberg has been sold in other parts of the 
English-speaking world under several inappropriate names (Regensberg being one 
of them and Buffalo Bill, the other), Young Mistress is probably the 
best-suited name for this rose, considering her constantly blushing color and 
that her parentage includes the imposing Old Master rose father of all the 
"hand-painted" roses. 
</P>
<P>
Regensberg is one of the latest additions to the "painted" series (the petals 
look as if someone had used a paint brush to lightly stroke another color on 
top of the white petals). 
</P>
<P>
Sam McGredy has the fine distinction of being known for his ability to turn a 
rose with an unstable color base into a much desired asset. Regensberg is a 
low-growing shrub, only growing about 2 1/2 feet tall but its flower size and 
cluster formation are typical of all floribundas. The flowers open white, but 
are quickly "painted" hot pink by the sun, the catalyst for the color changes. 
The bud and the partially opened bloom are the most beautiful stages of this 
rose with every flower a charmingly unique presentation of its bicolor petals. 
</P>
<P>
I grow two plants of Regensberg in the front of the flower bed with other low 
growing perennials (such as Candytuft and Crystal Blue Lobelia) surrounding 
them. The bushes get some afternoon shade so that I can enjoy a more "painted" 
look. The dark, glossy foliage is extremely disease resistant and is often 
hidden by a mass of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
For those who would like to enjoy Regensberg with all its lovely and unique 
characteristics but have limited space or problems bending I suggest planting 
three or four bushes in a half whiskey barrel with Candytuft or White Alyssum 
all around the edge. 
</P>
<P>
The very center of the barrel could be filled with three of the spiked Blue 
Salvia. This barrel of complimentary colors and sizes would dress up the corner 
of a wide driveway or stand near the front door to greet visitors. 
</P>
<P>
A little patience is needed while Regensberg gets established (it is slow to 
start the first year) and to find just the right combination of sun and shade 
to highlight the "hand-painted" look. 
</P>
<P>
For roses that are very different from what the "Jones' next door" have and for 
real unrestrained pleasure both, Playboy and Regensberg can't be beaten. In the 
South Bay, Playboy and Regensberg (distributed by Weeks Wholesale Rose Growers) 
can be found at the Palos Verdes Begonia Farm in Torrance, Park's Nursery in 
Long Beach and Ed &amp; Ruth's Nursery in Hawthorne. Other nurseries that carry 
Weeks grown roses will have Playboy and Regensberg as well.

<P>
You don't usually associate blueberry plants with Southern California, but if 
you select the correct varieties, they will thrive in many climatic zones of 
the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
The blueberries that grow well here are not the standard types that grow in the 
eastern or northern areas of the United States; standard blueberry varieties 
will not produce in warmer climates with mild winters such as ours. 
</P>
<P>
The blueberry varieties that grow well here are members of the Rabbiteye 
family. Rabbiteye blueberries are native to sections of the Deep South and they 
will withstand hot weather and also tolerate our mild winters. 
</P>
<P>
The quality of the fruit of Rabbiteye blueberries is quite good and the plants 
bear large quantities. Rabbiteyes not only produce delicious fruit, but the 
bushes, with their silver-green leaves and delicate white blossoms, are most 
attractive. The biggest obstacle is proper soil. 
</P>
<P>
Blueberries must have an acid soil. The ideal pH range for blueberries is 4.2 
to 5.2. If it goes higher than 5.5 the plants will not survive. 
</P>
<P>
This presents a problem for most Southern California gardeners, as most soils 
in the Southland tend to be alkaline. There are two ways to overcome this. You 
may plant Rabbiteye blueberries in half-whiskey barrels (one plant only to each 
barrel) in a mixture of two-thirds acid-type peat moss and one-third commercial 
potting soil, or you can add one cubic foot of peat moss to each planting hole 
in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
It is also possible to lower the pH factor by adding soil sulfur to your soil, 
but it's more troublesome. I grow Rabbiteyes in half-whiskey barrels with good 
success. 
</P>
<P>
Blueberries require an area that receives full sun. If planting in whiskey 
barrels, moisten the peat moss ahead of time and mix it thoroughly with the 
commercial soil mix. If planting directly in the garden, mix the peat 
thoroughly with some of the soil you have removed from the planting holes. 
</P>
<P>
Set the plants 1 inch deeper than they came in the nursery container. Never add 
fertilizer to the soil at time of planting. This is most important, as a dose 
of fertilizer will kill young plants. 
</P>
<P>
For the first eight weeks, if there is no rain, water the new plants twice a 
week. After this, when they become established, plants set in soil require 
water on a weekly basis. Plants in whiskey barrels will require irrigation two 
or three times a week. Never allow the soil to completely dry out. 
</P>
<P>
A correct fertilizing program is essential. Blueberries are extremely sensitive 
to excessive feeding. Do not fertilize the new plants until April. Then apply a 
fertilizer designed for camellias and azaleas at the rate of one ounce per 
plant. Spread over the soil surface evenly and water in thoroughly. Do this 
again in June and September. Repeat for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when the plants become large and established, fertilize with one-fourth 
pound of camellia-azalea type fertilizer each February and the same amount 
after the harvest period is over. 
</P>
<P>
Where do you buy Rabbiteye blueberry plants? They are sometimes available in 
local nurseries during bare-root season. Phone to see if your local nursery has 
them in stock. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Tree Farms in Chula Vista (619) 422-2400 usually carries a large stock 
of Rabbiteye varieties. In addition, Papaya Tree Nursery in Granada Hills (818) 
363-3680 and Tropic World Nursery in Escondido (619) 746-6108 usually carry the 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
A good mail order source for Rabbiteye plants is Finch Blueberry Nursery, P.O. 
Box 699, Bailey, N.C. 27807. They have a huge selection and will send a free 
brochure and price list. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that you must plant at least two different varieties for proper 
cross-pollination. Good varieties in our area include Woodward, Climax, 
Tifblue, Delite, Bluebelle and Briteblue. I grow Woodward and Climax. Again, be 
certain to plant at least two different varieties as most Rabbiteye blueberry 
varieties are not self-fruitful. 
</P>
<P>
As for harvesting, Rabbiteye blueberries don't reach flavor perfection until 
they have been fully colored for five or six days. Keep blueberries harvested 
on a weekly basis. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbiteye plants will grow quite large (depending upon variety) however, they 
can be controlled by pruning.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: RADIANT HEAT TAKES THE CHILL OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Several rooms in my home are too chilly. Will electric radiant 
heaters be effective? Are they less expensive to operate than baseboard heating 
and other types of electric heaters? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Electric radiant heat is an excellent method for heating and increasing 
your comfort in a chilly room. It has been used in Europe for many years to 
heat rooms and entire houses. 
</P>
<P>
Electric radiant heat can be very energy-efficient and, with no moving parts, 
it is practically maintenance-free. There are many different types of such 
heaters available for different applications in your home. 
</P>
<P>
One company even makes a thin radiant heater panel with a picture on it. When 
you hang it on your wall, it looks like a decorative picture in a frame. Since 
a radiant heater doesn't have to heat the room air in order for you to feel 
warm, you feel heat quickly after turning it on. This makes it ideal for 
bathrooms and bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Although most electric resistance heating is expensive to operate, radiant 
heating is more efficient for several reasons. First, you can set your 
thermostat lower and still be very comfortable. That can save up to 3% of your 
heating costs for each degree you lower your thermostat. 
</P>
<P>
Radiant energy heats objects and people in your rooms, not the room air itself. 
The effect is similar to standing in the warm sun on a cold day. The air 
temperature stays fairly constant from floor to ceiling, and you don't get the 
cool feeling you do with air blowing out from a heat pump. 
</P>
<P>
With electric radiant heat in several rooms in your home, you can easily "zone 
heat" your house. Since each room has its own temperature control, you can 
easily set it back in rooms you aren't using. 
</P>
<P>
For new construction, electric radiant heaters can be used in several ways. 
There are thin flexible sheets that are stapled under the ceiling joists. The 
standard gypsum board is then nailed under it. 
</P>
<P>
There are also thin, lightweight radiant panels that mount under the ceiling 
for use in existing rooms. You can easily hang them and they can be painted to 
match your room. 
</P>
<P>
You can also purchase gypsum board with heating elements embedded inside. You 
install these on the ceiling joists just like standard drywall. They are 
available with either 110- or 220-volt heating elements. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 044 showing a buyer's guide 
and list of manufacturers of various types of electric radiant heaters for 
existing rooms and new construction. Please include $1 and a self-addressed 
business-sized envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley, care of the Los 
Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio, 45244.

UNCOVERING COBA; 
</P>
<P>
HALF HIDDEN AMID THE TANGLED GROWTH OF CENTURIES, THE ANCIENT MAYAN CITY OFFERS 
NOT ONLY THE TALLEST PYRAMID IN YUCATAN BUT ALSO THE CHANCE TO EXPLORE AN 
ARCHEOLOGICAL WONDER STILL UNSPOILED BY CROWDS OF TOURISTS

COBA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Living in a city with its smog and its traffic, one forgets about clean air and 
space -- and butterflies. Especially butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
But in the jungles of the Yucatan peninsula, butterflies -- mariposas en 
espanol -- swarm everywhere, fluttering aimlessly across country roads like 
troupes of graceful ballerinas. And here in Coba, once one of the largest and 
most splendid of the great Mayan cities, amateur archeologists, with no more 
effort than a 10-minute hike, can see scores of the brightly colored creatures 
at certain times of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The jungles of the Yucatan can be unbearably hot and humid, but sighting these 
spectacular butterflies alone makes for a worthwhile journey. Coba has far more 
to offer than just mariposas, however. 
</P>
<P>
It takes planning to get here, though. For starters, one needs a rental car 
(traveling from Cancun or Merida), a full tank of gas and a willingness to 
venture a few steps off the well-beaten tourist path. Coba is about 90 miles 
from Cancun, about 150 miles from Merida. 
</P>
<P>
It's also wise to bring along a can of extra-strength mosquito repellent, and 
it helps to have a built-in tolerance for heat. But the rewards -- the 
butterflies, the solitude, the intense jungle silence and the tallest pyramid 
in the Yucatan -- are worth any inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
Coba is not Chichen Itza. The ruins don't measure up -- not in size, nor scope, 
nor perfection. No one on holiday in the Yucatan should miss Chichen Itza. But 
to its credit, Coba is free of Chichen Itza's almost Disneyland-like 
atmosphere. Missing are the busloads of loudly dressed tourists milling in 
hordes around the ruins. In Coba, you are generally on your own when you climb 
a pyramid. Once at the top, you can survey the jungle alone. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the tenor of your Yucatan vacation changes dramatically as soon as you 
turn off the main coastal highway that carries tourists from Cancun to Tulum, a 
distance of about 90 miles. From Tulum and its ruined walled fortress on the 
turquoise Caribbean, a two-lane, freshly paved road moves northwest into the 
thick Yucatan jungle. Hundreds of cars and buses jockey for position on the 
main highway, but during the hour or so that it takes to travel the 35 miles 
from Tulum to Coba, traffic is sparse. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside the road, in an occasional clearing, mud-and-straw-hut villages house 
the descendants of Indians who built the great Mayan cities more than 1,000 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise there are only tangled trees and impenetrable scrub. Occasionally a 
pig or a mule will saunter slowly across the road, but otherwise there is 
little sign of life. En route to Coba there are no gas stations and no 
telephones. Not even a Coke machine. 
</P>
<P>
Just when you begin to feel that perhaps the map and the tour books are 
incorrect, that you may be on the wrong road, you come upon the sign that 
reads: Coba. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God," you'll probably say with a sigh. "Civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
In the village of several one-story stucco buildings, entrepreneurs sell cheap 
souvenirs, and an air-conditioned hotel, the Villa Arqueologica Coba, provides 
shelter for about $35 double. The hotel has a swimming pool, a restaurant and a 
library of books on local history and archeology. 
</P>
<P>
Coba was founded about 1,300 years ago near a pair of lakes. The hotel 
overlooks one of the lakes, and a 10-minute walk along the shore brings you to 
the ruins, or at least those that have so far been uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
The entry fee, payable at a shack near the entrance, is about 35 cents. 
</P>
<P>
Just inside and to the right of the entry gate, the Grupo Coba boasts a 
towering pyramid of jagged gray rocks. Climbing the narrow steps can be 
treacherous, and by the time you reach the top you'll be thankful for having 
taken along a canteen of water. 
</P>
<P>
From atop the pyramid, both lakes come into sharp focus. Surrounding them, 
stretching in every direction, is a sea of foliage in various shades of green 
and brown. To one side, another pyramid, Nohoch Mul, juts into the sky, high 
above the jungle and the narrow, muddy path that leads to its base. 
</P>
<P>
The pyramid of Nohoch Mul towers more than 100 feet above the jungle floor -- 
taller than the spectacular El Castillo at Chichen Itza and the Pyramid of the 
Magician at Uxmal. 
</P>
<P>
In their present state, the 1,300-year-old pyramids of Coba don't sport the 
precision of the perfect, four-sided structures at Chichen Itza. They seem, 
rather, to have been built into hills, with steps leading up only the front 
side. 
</P>
<P>
The architecture of Coba, in fact, owes more to the style of the great Mayan 
cities of Tikal in Guatemala and Copan in Honduras than to the 
Toltec-influenced pyramids of nearby Chichen Itza that came along about 500 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
Nohoch Mul is a 15-minute jungle walk from Grupo Coba, and the view from its 
top is equally spectacular -- tangled foliage stretches for as far as you can 
see, much of it hiding ruins and roadways still to be uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the great Mayan cities were abandoned to the jungle about 1,000 years 
ago. No one is certain whether an epidemic, earthquake, overpopulation or a 
general breakdown of the social fabric caused the collapse of this great 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
Exploring Coba is tiring, the heat is blistering and the mosquitoes are 
merciless. After a good two hours of baking in this outdoor sauna, you'll yearn 
for a dip in the hotel pool. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving Coba, a 45-minute drive north will deliver you to the main Yucatan 
highway connecting Cancun and Merida. A left turn and an hour and a half more 
will take you to Chichen Itza. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of days amid the unparalleled ruins, pyramid, ball court and 
observatory at Chichen Itza will satisfy any hunger for more Mayan mystery. 
</P>
<P>
But even Chichen Itza's magnificent sights will not erase the memory of those 
quieter, perhaps more elemental ruins at Coba. The jungle trails. The uncrowded 
pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
And the butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
The only hotel in Coba is the Club Med-owned Villa Arqueologica Coba, which has 
air-conditioned doubles for about $35 a night. The hotel also has a swimming 
pool, restaurant and bar. For reservations, write to Hoteles Villa Arqueologica 
Coba, Avenida Masaryk 183, Mexico City, Mexico DF 11570. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the village residents offer primitive accommodations for much less. 
</P>
<P>
Daily flights to Cancun from Los Angeles are available on Mexicana and Delta 
Airlines for about $350 round trip. Nissan Sentras, Volkswagen Bugs and Jeeps 
can be rented at the Cancun airport for about $40 a day. Larger cars are 
significantly more expensive.

pyramids, the view, left, encompasses another in the distance. Hidden between 
the two is a Mayan palace yet to be cleared. Visitors can climb the jagged gray 
stone of either pyramid, top, or explore the ruins, above, at a far more 
leisurely pace than at Chichen Itza, below. IAN JONES; Map, Coba, Mexico,LIGAYA

FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW LEAD TO TOLSTOY'S HOME

YASNAYA POLYANA, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Winter blows into this city on westbound winds from the Volga Steppes. The snow 
flurries are hesitant at first, just a handful of flakes. Any minute they could 
taper off, leaving only a pale sun sliding into a gray eiderdown of clouds. 
</P>
<P>
But in this farmland, 130 miles south of Moscow, villagers know that by 
nightfall this winter day, the snow will thicken, swirling in over barn and 
field. The birches lining the long avenue that leads to Leo Tolstoy's home and 
birthplace will, by morning, stand deep in snow. 
</P>
<P>
In 1828, when Tolstoy was born at Yasnaya Polyana, the journey from Moscow took 
three days and six changes of horses. Today it takes three hours along a 
four-lane highway. 
</P>
<P>
Tolstoy, author of "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina," lived his most 
productive years in a simple, white, stone house that stands at the avenue's 
end. 
</P>
<P>
The snow squeaks underfoot. Overhead the birch branches are etched black 
against the white sky. 
</P>
<P>
At the head of the avenue, the path cuts left, passing through stands of fruit 
trees, descendants of the apple, pear and plum saplings that Tolstoy himself 
planted. 
</P>
<P>
The one-room structure where Tolstoy, a count by birth, set up a school for the 
children of serfs, still stands in a clearing, painted blue, closed and 
shuttered. Beside it, an artist, bundled against the cold, has set his easel. 
</P>
<P>
The house itself, white on white, stands amid snow-laden trees. On a small 
porch, just inside the door, visitors replace their shoes with tie-on cotton 
slippers. 
</P>
<P>
The Tolstoy family's favorite summertime gathering place was this porch. Its 
balustrade is decorated with fanciful wooden cut-outs of nursery creatures: 
roosters, gingerbread children and horses. Snow, trapped in their contours, 
highlights their rustic simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
The rooms within are small, intimate and crowded with memorabilia. Almost every 
wall contains numerous framed black and white photographs. Poorly lighted and 
fading with age, they provide a glimpse of the long-ago world, when 
intellectual pioneers journeyed to this forested retreat to sit and talk with 
its iconoclastic resident. 
</P>
<P>
Glass-fronted bookcases stand in every room. About 22,000 books in 30 languages 
have been preserved. In the margins of many, Tolstoy made commentary in his 
spidery, near-illegible, handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the other rooms, the dining room is generously proportioned. A 
table, covered with a white cloth, is set for eight with everyday blue and 
white china. 
</P>
<P>
Through the long windows, a thin, winter light shines on two large portraits. 
Tolstoy is seated at a crowded desk, and his wife Sofia, who bore him 13 
children, laboriously copies his manuscripts by hand. She is painted in black 
velvet robes, stylishly coiffed and looks untroubled and serene. 
</P>
<P>
In this room are also two grand pianos, at which family members often played in 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
A charming room, cozy and comfortable, it contains piles of music books, a 
chess board with a game in play, a handsome fruitwood table set up for a card 
game and photographs of formally-dressed children in ornate silver frames. 
</P>
<P>
Off the dining room, a picture gallery contains ancestral portraits. A small, 
unsigned watercolor shows Tolstoy, yoked to a plow and trudging symbolically 
between two horses. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond is Tolstoy's work room. The leather couch on which he was born is behind 
the desk. Pictures of Charles Dickens, Henry James and an American poet, Ernest 
Crosby, hang above the desk. 
</P>
<P>
Tolstoy's bedroom is a simple, monastic cell. The snowy landscape outside its 
windows reflects on the room's bare, white walls. 
</P>
<P>
A shepherd's crook, the wide-brimmed cotton hat and white peasant's robe 
Tolstoy wore in summer hang from a peg. A crude crutch is propped in a corner. 
</P>
<P>
His ironstone pitcher and basin sit in a washstand. The brass bedstead supports 
a narrow, hard bed, covered with a white coverlet adorned only by a small 
hand-embroidered pillow, worked by Tolstoy's sister, Mary, who was a nun. 
</P>
<P>
On the bedside table is a well-worn book. "Messages From the Life and Writings 
of William Penn." 
</P>
<P>
The guest room is no less austere. The bed is low and scarcely wide enough for 
one. This is the room in which Maxim Gorky and Anton Chekhov slept. 
</P>
<P>
William Jennings Bryan and Leonid Pasternak, father of Boris, and Tolstoy's 
close friend and admirer, the great Russian novelist, Ivan Turgenev, all stayed 
here. Countess Tolstoy's bedroom, at present, is not open to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
All the books, papers, furnishings and paintings were once removed by local 
villagers and hidden during World War II. The Germans did not find them. Not 
until the 1950s was the residence restored. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the front door stands a large elm tree towering over a homemade bench 
of birch boughs. This was one of Tolstoy's favorite spots, where he sat to 
receive the many pilgrims, who, in the last years of his life, arrived in a 
never-ending stream. 
</P>
<P>
Tolstoy wanted to be buried, without ceremony, in an unmarked grave. It's a 
10-minute walk through the forest to the site that he designated. 
</P>

The grave stands, just as he decreed, an oblong mount covered only with 
evergreen branches. The fresh-fallen snow deepens the silence of the small 
pine-scented clearing.

let a sleigh, piled high with birch logs, go by.

FALLING FOR THE NIAGARA PENINSULA'S WINE ROUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Canada 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Add wine to the already numerous inducements for visiting this lakeside hamlet 
on the Canadian side of the Niagara River's mouth in Ontario province. 
</P>
<P>
The Niagara Peninsula has long produced wine from native grapes that, at best, 
yield acceptable aperitif wines. But in little more than a decade, some small 
wineries have taken root in this splendidly situated region whose climate is 
moderated by Lake Ontario to the north and sheltered from cold continental 
blasts by a prominent ridge, the Niagara Escarpment, to the south. 
</P>
<P>
And the welcome mat is out to visitors who wend their way along the newly 
posted, picturesque Wine Route to sample the new premium bottlings. Since last 
year's harvest, these can now be labeled with their own Niagara Peninsula 
designation, Canada's first wine appellation. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily for tourists, the Wine Route also leads to a sampling of the region's 
other pleasures. Prominent among these is Niagara-on-the-Lake, a town of barely 
12,000 that offers tree-lined lanes, neatly maintained homes, a lake-side golf 
course and comfortably appointed, reasonably priced country inns. 
</P>
<P>
This bucolic understatement provides a welcome contrast to the garish city of 
Niagara Falls, about a dozen miles upstream. Yet the town's Queen Street offers 
just enough shops for browsing among woolens, antiques and porcelains, and a 
clock tower separating traffic in front of the 18th-Century courthouse that, in 
1792, served briefly as Capitol of Upper Canada, now Ontario province. 
</P>
<P>
As it approaches the river, the Wine Route passes in front of the contemporary 
wood-and-glass theater that is home to Niagara-on-the-Lake's annual George 
Bernard Shaw Festival, which runs from Easter to mid-October, then skirts Ft. 
George (named for one of the English kings) a key British bastion in the War of 
1812. America's counterpart, Ft. Niagara, is visible across the river's mouth 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
At the broad river, the Wine Route joins Niagara Falls Parkway and an adjacent 
bike path that meanders along the steep, forested banks before breaking west to 
crisscross orchards and vineyards on its way to complete the loop at historic 
Welland Canal. The canal's locks enable freighters to bypass Niagara Falls and 
find safe passage between Lakes Erie and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone who recalls Napa Valley, or for that matter Sonoma, before wine and 
wine tourism became big business, Niagara-on-the-Lake represents a welcome step 
backward. On this peninsula, which encompasses a dozen municipalities, about as 
many wineries have begun to offer samples of their production. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of quality and California prices, the region provides some interesting 
bargains, including a Pinot noir from Pelee Island in Lake Erie, Canada's 
southernmost point, which retailed at Ontario's government-controled retail 
store in Niagara-on-the-Lake for about $7. 
</P>
<P>
This new premium-wine industry traces its brief life to the day in 1973 when a 
young local vineyard supplier named Donald Ziraldo found himself defending the 
foxy-sweet wines produced from native Niagara grape varieties against the 
outspoken criticism of a customer, Karl Kaiser, a recent emigrant from Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Kaiser's response to the mediocre wine he had found in his adopted country was 
to make his own, and he eventually uncorked a bottle of dry rose to show what 
could be done under the peninsula's microclimate. 
</P>
<P>
Ziraldo recalled his amazement. "You made this from those?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
That tasting was to lead to the formation of Inniskillin Wines (in memory of an 
Irish military unit that fought on the peninsula during the War of 1812). The 
goal was to stay small and produce only fine wines. Today these include such 
Burgundian varieties as Pinot noir and Chardonnay, Riesling and Gewurtztraminer 
worthy of Alsace, as well as rarely encountered wines from French-developed 
hybrids that sport such unfamiliar names as Marechal Foch, Baco Noir and Vidal. 
</P>
<P>
Inniskillin produced 112,000 cases of mostly premium wine last year, though no 
more than 1,000 cases found their way into this country. But Inniskillin, which 
now owns prize Napa Valley vineyards at Rutherford, intends to begin changing 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Along with neighboring wineries, including Reif, German-owned Hillebrand and 
Chateau des Charmes, supported by the provincial government, the Canadians last 
month made their first marketing foray into New York -- which one importer 
characterized as "the epicenter of the wine world." 
</P>
<P>
But for now these wines remain a largely local secret, but it is one that the 
wineries are eager to make better known. Thus, most offer free tours and 
samples at little or no charge. Their warm, personalized reception contrasts 
with the increasingly impersonal experience one encounters in Napa Valley, 
where wine makers find themselves overrun by tourists and tour buses (even a 
new Wine Train), and where demand for tourist facilities and housing competes 
with demand for vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging is available all year at Niagara-on-the-Lake and along the lake to the 
west in bustling St. Catharines. Rooms fill fast each year during the Shaw 
Festival and on holidays, but help is available, toll-free, from the Ontario 
Ministry of Tourism and Recreation. Call toll-free (800) 268-3735. 
</P>
<P>
The area has a wide selection of reasonably priced lodging. The top of the line 
is represented by the Prince of Wales, where winter rates run from $94 for a 
single to $200 for a suite. 
</P>
<P>
Adjacent to the lake-front golf course is the Oban Inn, the 19th-Century 
residence of a shoe manufacturer, where rates range from $70 to $150 and 
afternoon tea is available on a glass-enclosed terrace. 
</P>
<P>
A best buy, just down Picton Street from the Prince of Wales, is the Moffat 
Inn, established as a hostelry in 1835. It offers antique-appointed rooms from 
$49 to $90 in winter and from $75 to $95 next summer.

ADVENTURE TRAVEL: MT. BACHELOR RUNS ARE AMONG BEST IN THE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

regular contributor to this section.

<P>
BEND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the alpine slopes near the top of Mt. Bachelor, descending waves of snow 
tumble west toward the main range of the Cascades and south toward the 
silhouettes of the California peaks around Mt. Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
Mt. Bachelor is laced with 54 ski runs, including one descent off a nearly 
vertical cornice that puts the ski expert into the air for up to a 10-foot 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
There are adventures for skiers of every ability on these slopes, where U.S. 
ski teams and Olympic contenders have trained for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Cross-country ski trails rated among the best in the country reach into the 1.6 
million acres of central Oregon's Deschutes National Forest, an area larger 
than the state of Delaware, and climb up to glaciers rising more than 3,000 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
The summit of Mt. Bachelor soars to 9,065 feet. The Mt. Bachelor Ski and Summer 
Resort recently was rated by Snow Country magazine as best in the Pacific 
Northwest and third-best nationally, behind Vail, Colo., and Squaw Valley, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
The skiing lasts into the summer months. The area also features white-water 
rafting on the Deschutes River, and, rising above nearby Crooked River, the 
soaring cliffs and spires of Smith Rock are becoming an increasingly popular 
challenge for rock climbers. 
</P>
<P>
Downhill and cross-country skiing can be tailored to your own abilities. The 
slopes have a vertical drop of 3,100 feet. About 25% of the runs are 
challenging enough to be rated for expert skiers; 35% are for advanced 
intermediates, and 15% for beginners. 
</P>
<P>
Despite uncertain snow conditions throughout the West, Mt. Bachelor was able to 
open for skiing the day after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are no overnight lodgings, Mt. Bachelor often draws about 12,000 
day-skiers on weekends. Lift lines are held to a minimum by 11 lifts that 
include three detachable quad chairlifts and five triples. 
</P>
<P>
The banks of the upper Deschutes River are less than 25 minutes from Mt. 
Bachelor. In late spring and early summer, one can spend the morning on snow 
skis and the afternoon bouncing over white water on a raft, canoe or kayak. 
</P>
<P>
Smith Rock, meanwhile, is now drawing climbers from as far away as Europe to 
test their skills on its awesome crags and spires. At least a score of such 
experts are among the 200 or so Smith Rock climbers on a busy weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Another challenge is to spend a summer's day biking the 22 miles from Bend 
through Sunriver and up the steep grade to Mt. Bachelor, then zigzag down 
trails back to Bend. Cycling the Crooked River with the spectacular vistas of 
Smith Rock can be another day of trekking on two wheels. Rental tandems as well 
as mountain bikes are available at local bicycle shops. 
</P>
<P>
Lift tickets this winter are $26 for adults, $14 for juniors ages 7 to 12 and 
$13 for seniors, but all can be part of special skiing and lodging packages. 
</P>
<P>
The Inn of the Seventh Mountain is the closest lodging to Mt. Bachelor; it's 
about 14 miles from the ski lifts. Double accommodations start at $149 per 
person for three nights' lodging, three days' skiing and the shuttle to and 
from the slopes. A studio with kitchen and fireplace is $194 per person. Call 
toll-free (800) 452-6810. 
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 accommodations at varying rates are available around Bend, Redmond, 
Sunriver and nearby communities. The Sunriver Lodge has indoor and outdoor 
racquet sports, hot tubs, saunas, 28 tennis courts and two golf courses, with 
many package rates available. Call (800) 547-3922. 
</P>
<P>
Bend, with its parks and downtown streets along the Deschutes River, has a full 
calendar of special events to flavor the many adventures of central Oregon, 
including the Pole, Pedal &amp; Paddle skiing, biking and canoeing competition 
in May and the Cascade Festival of Music in June. Museums, galleries, theater 
and concerts provide cultural attractions throughout the year. Among notable 
restaurants Cyrano's, Le Bistro and Mexicali Rose. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on travel to Bend, contact the Bend Chamber of Commerce, 
63085 N. Highway 97, Bend, Ore. 9770l, (503) 382-3221. 
</P>
<P>
For an inaugural 100 days through March 31, Alaska Airlines is providing daily 
service from Los Angeles to the Redmond/Bend Airport, with complete packages 
beginning at $299. The price includes air fare, three days' lodging and two 
days of skiing. 
</P>
<P>
A copy of the "Central Oregon" year-round guide to this area is available from 
the Central Oregon Recreation Assn., P.O. Box 230, Bend, Ore. 97709, (800) 
547-6858. The guide contains information on lodging, restaurants and 
river-rafting and cycling companies in central Oregon.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: SNOWMOBILES TOURS EASY EXERCISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HUGHES, Hughes is a 30-year veteran travel writer living in Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mature travelers who wish to participate in a sport other than skiing are being 
introduced to the Winter Sports Center of Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
Owners Ari and Tina MacKinen have developed easy-to-handle snowmobile tours for 
the mature individual, as well as cross-country skiing trips that are not too 
strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
Working with snowmobile manufacturers, sports and medical professionals, 
outdoor clothing manufacturers and safety experts, the MacKinens have brought 
snowmobiling from harsh rides and lots of noise to a smooth, muted trail 
adventure. 
</P>
<P>
They offer a two-hour guided snowmobile tour in scenic Hope Valley, just west 
of Lake Tahoe, for $65 per person. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few king and queen seats for double riders at $90 per couple. The 
cost includes shuttle-bus pickup and return from all Stateline, Nev., casino 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Novice snowmobilers might want to add $5 for an extra-warm snowsuit, $3 for 
snow boots and $3 for goggles. The safety helmet is included in the price. 
</P>
<P>
"Though the snowmobiles are capable of going much faster, our guided tours run 
at about 15 m.p.h. to 25 m.p.h. for mature riders," Tina MacKinen said. 
</P>
<P>
The tour route is graded and smoothed each morning to ensure a comfortable 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
For those who would rather try something shorter or who would want to test the 
snowmobile first, a 30-minute ride on the Winter Sports Center snowmobile track 
is $22 for one, $40 for a double-seater. 
</P>
<P>
The MacKinens also schedule night snowmobile rides for an additional $10 per 
person. 
</P>
<P>
The Winter Sports Center, on U.S. 50 at Tahoe Paradise by the Lake Tahoe 
Country Club, also offers cross-country skiing on a variety of novice-to-expert 
trails and on state recreation and park lands. Cross-country trails also are 
groomed daily. 
</P>
<P>
A daily pass is $5 per person, while a daily ski package -- including 
cross-country skis, boots and poles plus the area pass -- is $10. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomers to cross-country skiing often choose the 90-minute group lesson for 
another $9 (or $20 per person for the lesson, all equipment and a day pass). 
</P>
<P>
Complimentary shuttle-bus service also is included. 
</P>
<P>
The Winter Sports Center has special group rates for 15 or more mature 
travelers wishing to go snowmobiling or cross-country skiing. 
</P>
<P>
For group tours the center can arrange for a Snow Cat to meet the tour group's 
snowmobiles along the route for a mountaintop lunch. They also can provide Snow 
Cat rides for those who don't wish to try snowmobiling. 
</P>

NO BOLL WEEVILS IN THIS TURKISH 'COTTON PALACE'

PAMUKKALE, Turkey 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One moment you're winding along a two-lane road lined with pink, flowering 
bushes, through the gently rolling countryside in southwestern Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
The next, you reach the crest of a hill and the landscape in front of you 
suddenly erupts into a giant, white, frothy volcano. 
</P>
<P>
What appear to be massive sheets of blinding white snow and colossal icicles 
cascade from a height of 330 feet to the Denizli plain. 
</P>
<P>
What you've come across is Pamukkale, Turkey's famous "Cotton Palace." 
</P>
<P>
Thermal springs laden with calcium bicarbonate are responsible for the 
formation of this extraordinary sight. 
</P>
<P>
As the 95-degree water bubbles off the edge of the plateau and cools, it 
releases carbon dioxide and deposits chalky calcium carbonate on the side of 
the cliff. 
</P>
<P>
Over the centuries these chalk deposits have formed more than 100 basins and 
countless stalactites that stretch for more than three miles. 
</P>
<P>
Pamukkale's hot springs are world-renowned for their medicinal qualities. Since 
Roman times, travelers have journeyed here to rest and recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of the past is still visible in the nearby ruins of the ancient city 
of Hierapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pamukkale, 11 miles north of Denizli, is a popular stop on the tourist 
circuit. Tour companies in Izmir and Kusadasi frequently include it on their 
daylong excursion from the Aegean coast. 
</P>
<P>
Raucous herds of European tourists start tearing off their outer clothing and 
splashing noisily in the milky white water as soon as they get off the tour 
buses. Others soap themselves with chalk-mud and parade around like albino 
penguins. 
</P>
<P>
Every year May 25-27 the frenzy reaches a climax during the Pamukkale Festival, 
which features traditional Zeybek dancing. 
</P>
<P>
One way to appreciate Pamukkale, however, is to do as the Romans did: Stay for 
a leisurely couple of days or even weeks and let the thermal waters work their 
magic. 
</P>
<P>
For $50 to $100 U.S. a night, the hotels on the plateau above the calcified 
cliffs offer the most spectacular views and bathing pools. 
</P>
<P>
The Tusan Motel, for example, is partially enclosed by 11th-Century Byzantine 
castle walls and has an immense outdoor, hot-spring, swimming pool. Bathers can 
swim almost to the edge of the cliff and look out onto the vast Denizli Plain. 
</P>
<P>
The Tusan's dining room has large, open windows that offer a panoramic view of 
the countryside and tiny Pamukkale village. It is especially charming at night 
when the pinpricks of light in the houses below begin to twinkle. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the nearby Pamukkale Hotel, spring water flows over partially submerged 
marble columns and broken Corinthian capitals. 
</P>
<P>
The bathing area is surrounded by flowering gardens and cafe tables where you 
can sit and sip ayran, a popular Turkish yogurt drink. 
</P>
<P>
Some newer hotels, many of them still under construction, offer rooms for $15 
to $30 a night in Pamukkale village. 
</P>
<P>
Several rooftop terrace restaurants provide pleasant surroundings for a 
breakfast of omelets or a kofte (meatball) supper. New discos, taverns and 
souvenir shops are opening. 
</P>
<P>
But the precipitous terraces of Pamukkale are at their best in the morning 
before the onslaught of tourists. The chalky water in the pools is cool, and as 
you walk, the muck grabs at your feet like plaster of Paris, producing 
squishing sounds. 
</P>
<P>
A light blue mist generally shrouds the wheat-colored countryside until late 
morning, when it disappears under the rays of the hot Turkish sun. 
</P>
<P>
The name Pamukkale, or "cotton palace," probably refers to the cotton (pamuk) 
planted in the region or to the chalk terraces resembling cottonballs. Another 
explanation is that cotton is synonymous with the color white, giving rise to a 
palace, or kale. 
</P>
<P>
In the evening, Pamukkale is a photographer's delight. The basins undergo a 
succession of color transformations from clear azure to liquid gold to midnight 
blue as darkness covers the land. 
</P>
<P>
The healing power of the hot springs was known to the early Hittites and 
Phyrygians. However, it was King Eumenes II, King of Pergamon, who decided in 
190 BC to build a city near the site, naming it Hierapolis ("Holy City"). 
</P>
<P>
The ruins of the great bath of Hierapolis now house a small museum filled with 
finds from nearby excavations. 
</P>
<P>
Up the hill, behind the Pamukkale motel, you can walk among broken marble 
pillars from the famous temple of Apollo and see the martyrium of the apostle 
St. Philip, who was killed in Hierapolis in AD 80. 
</P>
<P>
If you search carefully you will find what is called Cin Deligi, the "Devil's 
Hole," due to the poisonous sulfuric gas emitted from the site. A sign beside a 
small door leading into the grotto still issues a warning to passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
This was originally part of the Plutonion built for Pluto, god of the 
underworld. In ancient times the only ones who entered safely were the priests, 
who crept along the floor from one oxygen pocket to another. 
</P>
<P>
The crowning glory of Hierapolis was -- and still is -- its magnificent 
10,000-seat theater. Only the excavation of the orchestra and the stage 
building has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
If you are willing to take a hazardous climb to the top of the outer rim of 
seats, you will be rewarded with an Apollonian view of the entire ruins and, 
far off, the white chalk cliffs of Pamukkale. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
The tourist season generally lasts from early April to the end of October. 
Daytime temperatures during that period are about 60 to 85 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey's modernized bus system connects Pamukkale or nearby Denizli with 
Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Antalya and other major cities. Buses run several 
times a day and tickets to most destinations cost $3-$5. 
</P>
<P>
Tour companies based in Izmir and Kusadasi offer one-day excursions that 
include a stop at Pamukkale. 
</P>
<P>
Car rentals in major cities average about $50 a day. The roads connecting to 
Pamukkale are well-maintained and well-marked. 
</P>
<P>
Three motels -- the Tusan, Pamukkale and Koru -- sitting on top of the plateau 
offer hot-springs bathing pools and splendid views of the chalk terraces. 
Prices range from $55 to $100 a night. 
</P>
<P>
In Pamukkale village, lower-priced rooms are $20 to $30 a night, with 
breakfast, and are available at motels such as the Yurok and Cetin.

FROM CAMDEN TOWN RIGHT TO PORTOBELLO ROAD, LONDON'S WEEKEND FLEA MARKETS ARE 
HOPPING

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The young woman sits patiently beside a table displaying her handmade jewelry 
and her purple and orange hair stiffened into a rig of spikes. Her jewelry is 
as colorful as she is -- rubber bracelets and earrings splashed with iridescent 
designs, fitted with studs and delicate chains. 
</P>
<P>
Around her are aspiring young designers, artists and artisans, selling 
everything from hand-sewn hats and clothing to pottery, jewelry and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
One young stallholder offers to pierce his customers' ears and nose. Nothing is 
too outrageous at Camden Town's weekend market. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of London on Portobello Road, an old man with a shock of white 
hair and a tweed jacket and looking very much like the college professor he 
used to be, holds up a glass figure from the 1920s so it catches the sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that," he said, with a tone of reverence. "If you were to put a lamp 
behind it so that it lit up, it would be very beautiful indeed." 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter to him whether he sells the piece. Collecting Art Deco is his 
hobby and his passion. Between customers he absorbs himself in books. 
</P>
<P>
Camden Town and Portobello Road are two of London's markets that are as varied 
as the vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Offering everything from Victorian bric-a-brac and costume jewelry to Art Deco, 
'50s kitsch, originally designed clothing, secondhand goods and household 
items, London's outdoor markets are as much a part of the shopping scene as 
Bond Street and Marks and Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
Open throughout the year, these outdoor markets are educational and fun. Many 
dealers are avid collectors and enjoy talking about their finds, and if you're 
inquisitive you can learn a lot about London and its history. In the process 
you can pick up some excellent bargains. 
</P>
<P>
Of all of London's outdoor flea markets, Petticoat Lane is probably the most 
famous -- but you won't find a street of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
This market stretches the length of Middlesex Street, radiating into side 
streets. Open only on Sunday mornings, it is for the common people who flock 
here by the thousands to buy kitchen gadgets, sweaters, coats, towels, 
clothing, accessories, junk and odds and ends. 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for pink polyester pants or a plastic vegetable grater, this 
is the place. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you don't intend to buy anything, Petticoat Lane is worth visiting just 
for its vendors, who are among the most talented street hawkers around. 
</P>
<P>
In a kaleidoscope of colors, noises and smells, they vie for shoppers' 
attention, each claiming to have the best bargain in all of London. 
</P>
<P>
One vendor, for example, may sell a handy tool that he promises will do 
everything from sharpening knives to cutting glass, while another may sell two 
silver rings for -- or so he claims -- the price of one. 
</P>
<P>
If it's Saturday, go to Portobello Road. Although some people grumble that this 
well-known market has disintegrated into a tourist trap, it offers so much 
variety and undergoes so much transformation as you walk its length that it 
makes great entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning as an antiques market, Portobello becomes a produce market and then 
dissolves into reggae and punk. In its own way, Portobello offers a good study 
of present-day London. 
</P>
<P>
If you begin your walk on Portobello near Notting Hill Gate station, you'll be 
surrounded by stall after stall of Victorian silver and antiques. 
</P>
<P>
Cutlery, silver-plated toast racks, pocket watches, button hooks, pipes, vases, 
sugar bowls, canes, china and jewelry are spread on tables and shelves along 
the side of the road and in the many shops and arcades. 
</P>
<P>
Past Elgin Crescent the market becomes one of vegetables and fruit, surrounded 
by shops with a distinct West Indies flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Indian silk scarfs, reggae records, ethnic restaurants and punk fashion all 
converge in a strange merging of dreadlocks and hair dyed purple. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing on Portobello Road past the produce market, you will soon come to a 
highway overpass, under which is a small shopping arcade called Portobello 
Green. Shops there sell original handmade crafts including jewelry, glass and 
clothing. Around Portobello Green is a maze of more stalls, selling used 
clothing, some Art Deco, collectibles and junk. From there it's just a short 
walk to Ladbroke Grove station. 
</P>
<P>
If you're interested in antiques, one of the best sources in town is the New 
Caledonian Market, also known as Bermondsey Market because it's held on 
Bermondsey Square. 
</P>
<P>
Open only on Fridays, this market is for serious collectors and dealers from 
around the world who arrive early to snatch up the best bargains. 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that customers arrived at 3 a.m. armed with flashlights to fish 
out the best items, but the law now dictates that bargaining can't start until 
7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to some furniture, Bermondsey Market offers silver, glass, china, 
dolls, clocks, cutlery, jewelry, canes and Victorian odds and ends. 
</P>
<P>
Another good place for antiques is Camden Passage (not to be confused with 
Camden Town). In a part of London called Islington, this antique market is open 
for business on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Old books are sold on Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
A small, pleasant market without the seething crowds that often descend on 
London's other sale sites, Camden Passage is made up of several indoor antique 
arcades and a narrow street dating from the 1760s, and is lined with small 
boutiques and shops and with vendors who have set up their stalls. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good place to look for period and paste jewelry, clothes, 
bric-a-brac, silver and odds and ends. 
</P>
<P>
How about some pre-World War II eyeglasses? Or a tea cozy? 
</P>
<P>
For the latest in avant-garde fashions by some of London's aspiring designers, 
go to Camden Town where several sprawling markets are held every Saturday and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Popular with London's younger generation, Camden Town is an eclectic and 
vibrant mix of fashion, ethnic items from India, crafts, Art Deco, '50s 
plastics and kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
Your first stop should be the Electric Ballroom, an indoor market beside the 
Camden Town underground station featuring original fashions and secondhand 
clothing, much of it outlandish and outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
Down the road are Camden Market and New Canal Market, two outdoor flea markets 
with more original and secondhand clothing, accessories and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
But the main draw of Camden Town is Camden Lock, a maze of tiny lanes and even 
tinier stalls, that finally open onto a small cobbled courtyard beside a canal. 
</P>
<P>
The Lock has some outdoor cafes, and you can board a boat for a pleasure ride 
to the London Zoo or Little Venice. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're interested in Art Deco, don't stop here. About a 10-minute walk 
from Camden Lock on Chalk Farm Road is the Old Stables, an old brick building 
that used to house horses in Victorian days. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers in and around this building specialize in Art Deco and '40s and '50s 
kitsch, including toasters, kitchenware, china, tea pots, figurines and 
collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have time to explore the markets listed above, several smaller 
markets are conveniently in the heart of London. 
</P>
<P>
Berwick and Rupert Street Market, for example, is the West End's only produce 
market and caters to the city's working crowd. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to fruits and vegetables, hawkers here also deal in clothes, 
jewelry, toiletries and accessories. It's only a few minutes' walk from Regent 
Street and is open every day except Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
Other markets in the heart of the city include Piccadilly Market in the 
forecourt of St. James's Church near Piccadilly Circus on Fridays and 
Saturdays, and Jubilee Market, held Monday through Saturday on the piazza of 
Covent Garden.

FOOTLOOSE: LOCARNO OFFERS ITALIAN FLAVOR IN A SWISS VILLAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
LOCARNO, Switzerland 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the blue waters of Lago Maggiore lapping at its palm-fringed lake front, a 
Mediterranean climate and the harmony of Italy's lilting language and hearty 
food, this Swiss town wears the style of its Latin neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland's southernmost canton of Ticano adjacent to Italy, Locarno also 
has a southern Mediterranean heritage. It was a flourishing town during Roman 
times and became even more prosperous in the Middle Ages with the arrival of 
the Lombard families. Locarno finally fell to Swiss armies in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Homes and buildings in the narrow streets of the Old Town were built in the 
16th and 17th centuries, and their pastel hues and tile roofs resemble the 
architectural style found farther south on the shores of Italy's lake region. 
That, combined with the 650 types of camellias the city boasts, creates a town 
that looks more Italian than Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
From the center of Locarno there's a cog-wheel train up to the Madonna del 
Sasso basilica. It then climbs to the Cardada Alp, which offers Alpine views, 
brisk mountain air and winter skiing. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Take Swissair's recently begun nonstop flight to Zurich. 
American, Pan Am and TWA also will get you here with stops. Then use a Swiss 
Pass (see below) for a four-hour train ride through the heart of Switzerland to 
Locarno. Alitalia flies nonstop to Milan, which is less than two hours by car 
or train from Locarno. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? While a full day will let you see most of the town, Locarno 
is an excellent base for a week of visiting Lugano, Ascona and other towns of 
Ticino and the Italo-Swiss lake region. Lodging costs are moderate for 
Switzerland, dining the same. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The Swiss franc recently sold at 1.65 to the dollar, making 
it worth about 60 cents. Locarno claims to be the sunniest town in Switzerland, 
with an average yearly temperature of 60 degrees. May/June and 
September/October are the best months for a visit, because European visitors 
create crowds during midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Garni Fiorentina (Via St. Antonio 10; $72 B&amp;B double 
high season, $66 low) is dead center of Old Town in a quiet pedestrian zone. As 
the French word garni implies, Fiorentina serves breakfast only, but a 
restaurant downstairs offers other meals. 
</P>
<P>
This is a little place set above a flowery patio, with contemporary bedrooms 
that use old and new fabrics imaginatively in the decor. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Zurigo (lake front, in town; $66 to $107 B&amp;B double, seasonal) has a 
small, cluttered lobby, but don't let that put you off. There's a good terrace 
restaurant and sidewalk cafe facing the lake, plus lake front bedrooms with 
balconies. It's near the train station, funicular, pier and shopping. 
</P>
<P>
Rosa Seegarten (Viale Verbano 25; $70-$103 B&amp;B double) also has a lake 
front terrace restaurant covered with a lush grape arbor and ringed with 
flowers and tropical plants. Most bedrooms facing the promenade and lake have 
small balconies with geranium boxes. There's also a tiny grotto-like bar, and 
breakfast is a generous buffet. Rosa Seegarten is also central. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Locarno's food has all the zest and exuberance of a 
Neapolitan tenor. There's plenty of pasta, hearty sauces, great veal and lots 
of northern Italy's polenta. 
</P>
<P>
Trout from the lake and mountain streams, plus egli (a lake fish), are 
plentiful, as is the local chestnut bread and minestrone ticinese. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Trattoria Marcacci (Via Marcacci 9) is in the heart of Old Town in 
a 450-year-old building. Dining is beneath rustic beamed ceilings inside or on 
a sunny patio. Try crostini porcini (toasted bread topped with wild mushrooms), 
gamberoni (prawns) or the risotto porcini (rice with mushrooms). What Marcacci 
lacks in decor it makes up for in friendliness and good food. 
</P>
<P>
Trattoria da Luigi (Via F. Balli 3) has a marvelous antipasti table within its 
skylighted indoor room. Seven fresh pastas are served daily and it offers a 
full menu of interesting Italian dishes. 
</P>
<P>
It's near the main piazza. Dining is on an outside terrace, beginning always 
with crostini "on the house." Owners Jeanette and Luigi Belfiore serve a superb 
ravioloni di magro al burro e salvia (thin ravioli with butter and fresh sage). 
</P>
<P>
Ristorante la Fiorentina (Via San Antonio 10) has perhaps the finest ambience 
in town, with a vaulted dining room, a patio with fountain and flowers and 
views of the mountains behind the town and lake. 
</P>
<P>
There's a daily menu of Italian specialties (all you can eat) in the $11 range, 
another for $7.50. Both give you pasta, salad and such main courses as veal 
scaloppina di tacchino with rosemary. Fiorentina is a real bargain, and the 
food is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: Grand Hotel Locarno (Via Sempione 7; $96-$120 B&amp;B 
double, low season, $114-$138 high) dates from 1876 and has the soaring 
ceilings, chandeliers, neo-classic columns and faint aura of faded elegance 
that characterize a grand dame of that era. The dining room has a gigantic 
fireplace, baroque ceiling painted with a distinct ecclesiastic feel to it and 
superb food. The shrimp bisque with cognac, panache of gnocchi tessinoise and 
saddle of veal with mushroom sauce were all outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a bar, gardens, pool and tennis courts. Bedrooms are huge. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: After strolling the lake front, take the cog train up to the 
15th-Century Madonna del Sasso church, then continue to Cardada Alp for a walk 
over to the rustic Ristorante Colmanicchio for lunch or a coffee on the terrace 
while you view the town and lake below. 
</P>
<P>
Back in town, visit the 14th-Century Visconti Castle that houses the town's 
Archeological Museum with Roman-era artifacts and later frescoes. Nearby is 
Casa Rusca, a patrician home converted into an attractive modern-art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
From Modonna del Sasso, a funicular and chairlift takes you to the crest of 
Cimetta at 5,500 feet where there is a winter Swiss Ski School, restaurant and 
lodging. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to visit the 17th-Century nobleman's home in town with its beautiful 
garden and chapel, the last built so that the then-Pope would issue a 
dispensation for the owner to marry his first cousin. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Call the Swiss National Tourist Office at (415) 362-2260, 
or write 260 Stockton St., San Francisco 94108 for brochures on Locarno and 
Ticino with hotel listings, a map of Switzerland and information, plus costs 
for the Swiss Pass, good on most all types of transportation within the 
country. Ask for the Locarno package.

THE TIMES SHOPPER: CRAZY GUNNAR IS NOT DISCOUNTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER MERIN, Merin is a New York City free-lance writer. 
</P>

<P>
GOTHENBURG, Sweden 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Galne Gunnar, which translates to Crazy Gunnar in English, is ruining Sweden's 
reputation as an expensive place to shop. It's a variation on the American 
discount store. 
</P>
<P>
Doors to the first Galne Gunnar (pronounced GAL-na GUN-nar) were opened about a 
year ago. The five-store chain is owned by Hennes &amp; Mauritz, a trendy 
Swedish clothing firm. It sells Hennes &amp; Mauritz fashions, usually from one 
season past, at a fraction of their original price. Stock changes daily. 
</P>
<P>
Although the idea for Galne Gunnar came from the United States, the store has 
Swedish style. Wares are displayed on counter-like tables, open racks and 
sometimes even in cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Although Galne Gunnar stores are not found on the tourist trail, they're in 
well-populated suburbs and can be easily reached by taxi or public 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gothenburg area, on Sweden's west coast, Galne Gunnar is in the suburb 
of Kallered, at the Ljud &amp; Bildhuset shopping complex on Ekenleden. A taxi 
from the town center costs about $8 U.S. round trip between the hotel and the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Public buses are about $1, but the trip is a bit more complicated. Get 
directions at the Gothenburg Tourist Office, Kungsportplatsen 2. 
</P>
<P>
The Gothenburg shop isn't the largest in the chain, but is well stocked with 
major brands at mini-prices. 
</P>
<P>
It has Adidas jogging suits for $24, Adidas terry-cloth robes for $41, Naf Naf 
velour shirts for $15, cozy down vests in colorful chartreuse and purple for 
$16, quilted down coats by Capri in sparkling snowman white for $94, and 
rain-resistant cotton coats with removable linings bearing the Hennes &amp; 
Mauritz label for $31. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton jerseys, $12, with modified turtlenecks, are offered in nine colors 
(including lavender, smoky purple and tarnished gold); pure wool sweaters with 
Scandinavian patterns cost $15 and hip-length sweaters with matching 
straight-line wool skirts in solid colors are $12 for the set. Baggy sweaters 
that cost $15 match slinky tube skirts that cost $7. 
</P>
<P>
Men's corduroy trousers sell for $15, leather jackets for $79, Adidas sweaters 
for $20 and down jackets $47. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a selection of clothing for toddlers and teen-agers. Jeans cost 
$26, single-piece snowsuits in cheerful colors are $39, two-piece snowsuits 
with pastel-colored quilted down pants and jacket are $26, infant-size 
snowsuits cost $24, sets of lavender-and-aqua cotton T-shirts and trousers for 
babies are $4.50 and little popcorn knit sweaters in pink and white go for $8. 
</P>
<P>
Purple cotton long-sleeve sweaters are sold with plaid wool overalls for $28 a 
set, and little denim or printed cotton dresses with smocking collars cost $8. 
</P>
<P>
Toys include $15 Puffalumps, which cost $63 apiece in other Swedish stores, 
Matchbox trucks for $6 and cars for $3.50. There are brightly-colored and roomy 
backpack/bookbags that fit onto a little luggage trolley for $9, and matching 
kid-size director chairs for $5. 
</P>
<P>
Sports enthusiasts will find a selection of top-label running and tennis shoes, 
plus Nordica and Weinmann ski boots for $79 and Atomic, Avantgarde and Fischer 
RC4 skis for $110. 
</P>
<P>
Household goods include cans of cream of asparagus soup (31 cents), wicker 
bread baskets lined with colorful cotton ($2), pound packets of strong Swedish 
coffee ($7) and battery-operated electric toothbrushes ($3). 
</P>
<P>
Galne Gunnar has additional shops in Stockholm's suburbs of Huddinge 
(Tangentvagen 2) and Taby (Arninge Centrum on Saluvagen) and in Jonkoping 
(Osterungens Centrum, Birkagatan 8) and Vasteras (Friledningsgatan 8). The 
Stockholm stores are accessible by public transportation. Get directions from 
the Tourist Information Center, Sweden House, Kungstradsgarden. 
</P>
<P>
Although all Galne Gunnar stores sell similar merchandise, there's a 
money-savings incentive for stopping in Gothenburg. The city offers weekend 
hotel rates from $30 a night, including a buffet breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
And Galne Gunnar offers Sweden's tax-free benefits to tourists who spend at 
least 100 Swedish crowns (about $15 U.S.) and export purchases. At most other 
stores the minimum purchase is 200 Swedish crowns, and you get a 23% tax 
rebate. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Galne Gunnar sales people for documentation to show, along with 
merchandise, at tax-rebate counters at the airport or border before leaving 
Sweden. Refunds are made on the spot in Swedish crowns, which can be exchanged 
for U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Prices quoted in this article reflect currency exchange rates at the time of 
writing.

YOUTH BEAT: MATTERHORN HIKE CELEBRATES CONQUEST OF PEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON, Izon is a Canadian travel journalist covering youth budget 
routes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Travelers between the ages of 16 and 30 are invited to join a special hike to 
celebrate the 125th anniversary of the first ascent of the Matterhorn in 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
The famous "bent pyramid" peak was conquered in 1865 by English mountaineer 
Edward Whymper, but his team paid a very high price. Four members slipped to 
their deaths. Only a broken rope saved Whymper and two of his guides. 
</P>
<P>
Today climbing the Matterhorn has become almost commonplace. During summer more 
than 600 people per season hire guides at 520 Swiss francs (about $338 U.S.) to 
attempt the climb. 
</P>
<P>
It's still serious business, though, and recklessness, plus weather shifts, 
result in about a dozen deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
The special anniversary hikes next July and August, however, do not involve 
climbing to the famous summit. Instead, it's a walking tour of that spectacular 
region of the Swiss Alps. 
</P>
<P>
Don't be misled by the term "walking tour." It has been my experience that the 
Swiss definition of "walking" and the American concept of the term are often at 
least half a world apart. Five to nine hours a day of mountain hiking, with a 
pack, at altitudes your body is not accustomed to, can be quite an eye-opener 
for the inexperienced. 
</P>
<P>
The program is scheduled to start in Grindelwald. From there the group will 
ride by train up to Jungfraujoch. The hiking route includes the 14-mile Aletsch 
Glacier (Europe's largest) and on to the Simplon Pass. 
</P>
<P>
One night is spent in the car-free town of Saas Fee. Glaciers reach to within 
1,640 feet of this mountain village, and nine miles of slopes are open 
throughout the summer for skiing. It's a favorite area for national ski teams 
to train. 
</P>
<P>
Nights are spent at youth hostels, mountain huts and the Swiss Alpine Club 
huts. SAC promotes mountaineering and ski tours in the high mountains, and 
organizes rescue services. SAC huts have bunk rooms for 10 to 20 people 
(blankets included). Expect gas lighting and a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
After reaching Zermatt on the sixth day the group will rest for a night before 
visiting Schwarzsee and Horlihutte at the foot of the Matterhorn. A two-hour 
walk from the Schwarzsee cable-car station is the hut where Matterhorn 
mountaineers spend the night before their ascent. 
</P>
<P>
The program is being organized by Jugi Tours, the travel service of the Swiss 
Youth Hostel Assn. Restrictions apply, and participants who have had some 
mountain walking experience are preferred. 
</P>
<P>
Departures will be July 14, July 28 and Aug. 11. The cost is 565 francs (about 
$368 U.S.). That price includes accommodations, breakfasts and dinners (you can 
buy packed lunches), necessary bus and train travel and the services of a 
mountain guide and tour escort. 
</P>
<P>
For more details, contact Jugi Tours at Neufeldstrasse 9, 3012 Bern, 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
If this is out of your budget range, you can always base yourself at one of the 
more than 90 Swiss Youth Hostels, and get information from the local tourism 
office about hikes in the area. Switzerland has more than 30,000 miles of 
well-kept, marked paths. Hostel accommodations average less than 15 francs a 
night. At Swiss youth hostels, preference is shown to travelers under age 25 
during busy periods. 
</P>

TO LIVE AND DIE IN SHANTYTOWN

ALTO DO CRUZEIRO, BRAZIL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Why do the church bells ring so often?" I asked Nailza de Arruda soon after 
I'd moved into a corner of her tiny mud-walled hut near the top of the 
shantytown called the Alto do Cruzeiro (Crucifix Hill). I was a Peace Corps 
volunteer. It was the dry and blazing hot summer of 1965. Save for the rusty, 
clanging bells of N.S. das Dores Church, an eerie quiet had settled over the 
market town that I call Bom Jesus da Mata. "It's nothing," replied Nailza, 
"just another little angel gone to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Nailza had sent more than her share of "little angels to heaven." Sometimes at 
night, I could hear her muffled but passionate conversations with one of them, 
2-year-old Joana. Joana's photograph, taken as she lay, eyes open, propped up 
in her cardboard coffin, hung on a wall next to the one of Nailza and Ze 
Antonio on the day they eloped. 
</P>
<P>
Nailza could hardly remember the other infants and babies who'd come and gone 
in close succession. Most had died unnamed and had been hastily baptized in 
their coffins. Only Joana, properly baptized in church at the end of her first 
year and placed under the protection of a powerful saint, Joan of Arc, had been 
expected to live. And Nailza had dangerously allowed herself to love the little 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
In addressing the dead child, Nailza's voice would range from tearful imploring 
to angry recrimination: "Why did you leave me. Was your patron saint so greedy 
that she could not allow me one child on this earth." 
</P>
<P>
Ze Antonio advised me to ignore Nailza's behavior, which he understood as a 
kind of madness that, like the birth and death of children, came and went. 
Indeed, the premature birth of a stillborn son some months later "cured" Nailza 
of her "inappropriate" grief. The day came when she removed Joana's photo and 
carefully packed it away. 
</P>
<P>
More than 15 years elapsed before I returned to the Alto do Cruzeiro. Since 
1982, I have returned several times to investigate a phenomenon that first 
attracted my attention while I was in the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
The Alto do Cruzeiro is one of three shantytowns surrounding Bom Jesus in the 
sugar-plantation zone of Pernambuco in Northeast Brazil. The region, 
approximately twice the size of Texas, encompasses nine states. As the poorest 
in the country, they are representative of the Third World within a dynamic and 
rapidly industrializing nation. 
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in the Northeast is only 40 years, largely because of the high 
rate of infant and child mortality. Approximately a million Brazilian children 
under age 5 die each year. The children of the Northeast, especially those born 
in shantytowns on the periphery of urban life, are at a very high risk of 
death. They lack the traditional protection of breast-feeding, subsistence 
gardens, stable marriages and multiple adult caretakers that survives in the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
In the hillside shantytowns that spring up around cities or, in this case, 
interior market towns, marriages are brittle, single parenting is the norm and 
women are frequently forced into the shadow economy of domestic work in the 
homes of the rich or into unprotected and "scab" wage labor on the surrounding 
sugar plantations. The women of the Alto may not bring their babies with them 
into the homes of the wealthy because the frequently sick infants are 
considered sources of contamination. They cannot carry them to the riverbanks 
to wash clothes because the river is heavily infested with schistosomes and 
other deadly parasites. Nor can they carry their young children to the 
plantations. At wages of a dollar a day, the women of the Alto cannot hire 
baby- sitters. Older children who are not in school will sometimes serve as 
care-takers. But any child not in school is also expected to find wage work. In 
most cases, babies are left at home alone, the door securely fastened. 
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon that first attracted me crystallized during a veritable 
"die-off" of Alto babies during a severe drought in 1965. The food and water 
shortages, as well as the political and economic chaos that followed a military 
coup that year, were reflected in the handwritten entries of births and deaths 
in the ledgers kept at the public registry office in Bom Jesus. More than 350 
babies died in the Alto alone. Yet, there were ample reasons for the deaths in 
the miserable conditions of shantytown life. What puzzled me was the seeming 
indifference of the Alto mothers and their willingness to attribute to their 
dying babies an aversion to life that made their deaths seem wholly natural. 
</P>
<P>
I learned that the mothers' strong expectation of death and their ability to 
face child death with stoicism and equanimity produced distinctive patterns of 
nurturing. Infants thought of as thrivers and survivors were nurtured. When 
infants were stigmatized, that is, thought to be born already "waiting to die," 
mothers stepped back and allowed nature to take its course. These devout women 
do not consider this sinful. Rather, it is understood as cooperating with God's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
Frequent child death remains a powerful shaper of maternal thinking and 
practice. In the absence of a firm expectation that a child will survive, 
mother love is attenuated and delayed. In an environment already precarious for 
young life, the emotional detachment of mothers toward some of their babies 
contributes even further to the spiral of high mortality-high fertility in a 
kind of macabre lock-step dance of death. 
</P>
<P>
The average woman of the Alto experiences 9.5 pregnancies, 3.5 child deaths, 
and 1.5 stillbirths. Seventy percent of all child deaths occur in the first six 
months of life, 82% by the end of the first year. Of all deaths in the 
community each year, about 45% are of children under age 5. 
</P>
<P>
With life in the Alto do Cruzeiro resembling that in an emergency room in an 
overcrowded inner-city public hospital, morality is guided by a kind of 
"lifeboat ethics," the morality of triage. The seemingly studied indifference 
toward the suffering of some of their infants, conveyed in such sayings as 
"little critters have no feelings," is understandable in light of these women's 
obligation to carry on with their reproductive and nurturing lives. 
</P>
<P>
Also, in a society where triplicates of every form are required for the most 
banal events, the registration of infant and child death is informal, 
incomplete and rapid. It requires no documentation, takes fewer than five 
minutes and demands no witnesses other than office clerks. Cause of death is 
left blank, unquestioned and unexamined. From the registry office, the parent 
walks over to town hall, where the mayor will give him or her a voucher for a 
free baby coffin. 
</P>
<P>
The church, too, contributes to this routinization of child death. Under 
Liberation Theology, the bells of N.S. das Dores Church no longer peal for the 
death of Alto babies. No priest accompanies the procession to the cemetery. No 
prayers are recited. No sign of the cross is made as the coffin is lowered into 
the grave. In a few months, the remains of the former occupant are tossed into 
the deep well called the "bone depository." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the women of Bom Jesus are survivors. One, Biu, told me her life 
history, returning again and again to the themes of child death, her first 
husband's suicide, abandonment by her father and later by her second husband, 
and all the other losses and disappointments she had suffered in her long 45 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"No, Dona Nanci, I won't cry, and I won't waste my life thinking about it from 
morning to night . . . Can I argue with God for the state that I'm in? No! And 
so I'll dance and I'll jump and I'll play Carnaval! And yes, I'll laugh and 
people will wonder at a pobre like me who can have such a good time."

HOLDING AN ELECTION? FIRST WAKE THE VOTERS. . .; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SEEKING TO ENGAGE THE ELECTORATE, POLITICAL PROFESSIONALS RELY ON 
TECHNIQUES THAT ALIENATED PEOPLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
For political professionals, this fall's election looms as a landmark struggle. 
It will determine which party holds the governor's chairs and state 
legislatures that will draw new congressional districts following the 1990 
census -- and so decide control of Congress through the end of the century. 
Aside from presidential campaigns, no contest this decade is more important to 
the people who run in, manage and fund elections. 
</P>
<P>
For the people who vote in U.S. elections, this campaign looks like another 
yawn. 
</P>
<P>
Yawns were the big winner when one candidate in this fall's California 
gubernatorial race -- considered by some national strategists the most 
important in the nation -- recently convened a focus group to quiz Los Angeles 
voters about the contenders. Many people in the room couldn't name anything 
Republican Pete Wilson had done in the U.S. Senate, were unaware that Democrat 
John K. Van de Kamp was the state's attorney general and believed his rival for 
the Democratic nomination, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, still 
held that job. 
</P>
<P>
Because California is so vast and so much of its media pays so little attention 
to politics, office-seekers here probably have more trouble reaching the public 
than in any other state. But the problem facing Wilson, Van de Kamp and 
Feinstein is unique only in its severity. 
</P>
<P>
Indifference is a fact of life for campaigns today. In many respects, it is the 
shaping fact of life. Indifference is defining the style of U.S. campaigns. 
Paradoxically, it is driving candidates toward greater reliance on the tools 
that many believe are alienating voters: rapid-fire TV ads, personal attacks 
and the use of symbolic, divisive "wedge" issues -- such as George Bush's 1988 
criticism of Michael S. Dukakis' membership in the American Civil Liberties 
Union. These tools may engender political cynicism, but they provide the flash 
and emotion politicians need to reach an increasingly jaded and distracted 
electorate. The more cynical the public, the more flash and emotion campaigns 
need -- and the more they employ the weapons of manipulation that encourage 
cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
For challengers, the problem is obvious: getting anyone to pay enough attention 
to learn their names. But even incumbents are finding it difficult to carve out 
a strong public profile. Although voters typically give high marks to their 
governors and senators when surveyed, their judgments often depend more on 
vague impression than deep affection. 
</P>
<P>
And those numbers can plunge faster than the stock market on a jittery Monday. 
Sen. Alan Cranston is the latest veteran politician to learn this. Cranston has 
represented California in the Senate for more than 20 years, and yet the 
disclosure of his intervention on behalf of Lincoln Savings and Loan owner 
Charles H. Keating Jr. was enough to reverse the public's opinion virtually 
overnight: Cranston's ratings collapsed from 56% positive to 58% negative in 
Los Angeles Times polls only two months apart. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to think of many politicians to whom the phrase 'beloved' applies," 
said Republican media consultant Larry McCarthy, who is working with Wilson in 
the gubernatorial race. "They may have won respect, not to mention reelection, 
but it is hard to think of many who have really a personal bond with their 
electorate. . . . Cranston suffers from what every politician suffers from: 
They have a very fragile base." 
</P>
<P>
That awareness is driving campaign strategy for the 1990s. In this atmosphere 
of political disengagement, TV commercials are simultaneously becoming more 
important and less efficient. Because so many voters lack the motivation to 
look elsewhere for insight into the candidates, campaigns are rushing ads to 
television earlier and more heavily, hoping to define themselves before their 
opponents do. But voters have become so accustomed to political commercials -- 
and are so overwhelmed by the proliferation of all commercials -- that they are 
more likely to change channels or simply ignore them, many consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
Candidates find themselves in the position of farmers who have to spray twice 
as much pesticide to reach targets increasingly resistant to the poison. "When 
they see another guy with a 40-buck haircut talking about crime, zap, they 
change the channel," said GOP media consultant Mike Murphy. "They've heard all 
that stuff before and there is a credibility problem. You blend into the 
background." 
</P>
<P>
For politicians, the communications problem is further complicated by the 
fractionated audience; arguably, the middle- to upper-income people who vote 
most regularly spend the least time watching the traditional networks and local 
independent channels where campaigns concentrate their ads. In fact, as some 
political consultants note, those upper-income households often watch premium 
cable channels that prohibit advertising or rent movies for the VCR -- 
diversions that remove them altogether from an ad's potential audience. 
</P>
<P>
Thus candidates are finding fewer opportunities to reach voters. That heightens 
the importance of what GOP National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater has dubbed 
"wedge issues" -- symbolic, emotional concerns that quickly divide the 
electorate. "This environment invites issues that people can work out without a 
lot of information, that are easy to understand and have a 'right' and 'wrong' 
side," said Democratic pollster Stanley B. Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Of all wedge issues, abortion now seems most potent. At a time when government 
actions seem distant and abstract to most Americans, abortion is the exception. 
It has generated such strong political reaction precisely because it appears to 
be one of the rare government decisions that affects individual lives. The 
irony is that, because the Supreme Court's Webster decision last year gave the 
states more leeway to regulate abortion, this polarizing energy will be 
channeled primarily into the traditionally nonideological state legislative and 
gubernatorial races -- such as the recent contests in New Jersey and Virginia. 
"The battle lines have completely changed," said Michelle M. Davis, executive 
director of the Republican Governors Assn. (In California, because all three 
gubernatorial candidates share pro-choice views, abortion is likely to be less 
central.) 
</P>
<P>
For the same reasons most campaigns will rely on wedge issues, they will remain 
dependent on negative advertisements. Though consultants and candidates swore 
off the stuff after excessively vitriolic attacks in New Jersey and Virginia 
appeared to backfire, don't bet on them holstering the invective for long. The 
reason: When people know little about candidates and are not inclined to absorb 
much information, emotional, negative ads are the most efficient way to move 
the polls, many consultants believe. "Negative ads generally stick faster than 
positive ads," said Murphy. "You get more bang for the buck." 
</P>
<P>
At the most profound level, the pattern of public disengagement from politics 
is becoming self-reinforcing. With each passing election, candidates seem to 
spend less time with ordinary people and more time shuttling between exclusive 
fund-raisers and recording studios -- hoping that enough money and clever 
commercials will finally overwhelm the electorate's indifference. This makes it 
logical that potential voters find little to interest them in campaigns -- and 
politics drifts toward the margin of national life. Even as political change is 
opening long-shuttered societies across Europe and exhilarating millions, U.S. 
politics is attenuating into an insider's game -- a treadmill that isolates our 
politicians from the people they hope to represent. That's a development more 
worthy of anger than indifference.

GOOD-BAD ADVICE FOR EAST EUROPEANS NOW ENTERING THE WORLD MARKETPLACE;

<P>
During the past few months, we have witnessed the most unexpected change in 
political life that any member of my generation could have imagined. Those of 
us who fought in World War II -- when the Western democracies were "allied" 
with the world's largest communist country -- assumed that the price to be paid 
for helping democratic institutions survive was a recognition that 
Soviet-dominated countries would survive in like manner. That is to say: 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
But political science is no more a science than economics is, and no one in the 
world has come forward to claim that he or she predicted the downfall of 
dictatorial regimes in Eastern Europe, even as recently as two days before any 
one of them collapsed. And no one has come forward with new information sheets, 
guidebooks, directions or instructions as a briefing on what to expect of a 
free economy. So I offer a few notes. 
</P>
<P>
In my Western, democratic, free-market country, worldly wisdom consists in 
understanding that there is no good news without attendant (simultaneous or 
resultant) bad news. For example, so many of our advanced medications eliminate 
pain but cause insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
The essence of what makes political freedom so attractive is the opportunity to 
cultivate one's individualism. This is usually achieved at a cost of losing all 
sense of being a member of a group. What goes first is responsibility for 
supporting your nation civically, militarily or financially. What goes next is 
participation in fraternal social groups: political parties, philanthropic 
organizations, religious bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Professional organizations might be the last to be abjured and abandoned, 
because they contribute to the possibility of enhancing income. The smallest 
and most intimate group, the nuclear family, survives despite the fact that 
much of the population confuses it with a catastrophic stage of war. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, there was at least the possibility of some social relationship 
established by talking with a person at a bar. A bar was a public house where 
one could reasonably expect to engage in conversation with another human being 
and come away somewhat revived or enriched. All that ended when television was 
introduced. Once that set was suspended above the head of the bartender -- 
every pair of eyes of every person seated on a bar stool was riveted to it -- 
the possibility of spontaneous social intercourse died. Most people have become 
inarticulate (dumb), except in their workplace. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if it hadn't been for television, this great change taking 
place in response to popular uprisings throughout Eastern Europe would not yet 
have come about; the regimes would probably have machine-gunned to death every 
protester. But only six months earlier, for every night, every week, adding up 
to the months during which all those Chinese youths yearned for a little bit of 
participatory democracy, what was seen on television was the way a senile, 
entrenched totalitarian communist regime murdered its own children. 
</P>
<P>
Never before in the history of the rise and fall of governments has the whole 
world been able to watch such disasters unfold and see how the refusal to share 
power makes self-justifying rejection possible -- and deadly. 
</P>
<P>
The good news about political freedom combined with a market economy is that 
you have the chance of doing something you like to do -- and do it well enough 
to make a decent or reasonable living. That achievement gives not only the 
material satisfaction of making a better living than you made before, but it 
also has the psychological reward that comes with doing something worthwhile. 
The bad news is that even more money can be earned by doing things that are not 
worthwhile. Thus, the opportunities may come about for riches of such magnitude 
as constitute an indecent and unreasonable living. 
</P>
<P>
Although economics is not a science, business administration is a practical 
skill; our graduate schools of business have so evolved that they can instruct 
people unable to produce any object or perform any service to make more money 
than people who can carry out either task. The key is to treat all resources 
abstractly. For example, think of a factory that produces automobiles merely as 
a mechanical operation that results in a profit. 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating any thought of the well-being of the people who pay for and 
drive automobiles, and similarly abstracting any concern about the quality of 
the automobile produced, an executive may concentrate exclusively on the 
financial relationship between costs, sales and income to maximize profit for 
the longest period of time. Then he can move off to the retirement homes of the 
rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
Who wants to work hard to make movies when you can sell movie studios much more 
easily -- and for a great deal more money? 
</P>
<P>
In other words, for all the good news of the chance to improve your life 
financially through actions in a free-market economy, the bad news is that the 
practical consequences of conditions that allow the free-market economy to be 
what it is ultimately result in individualism at its worst. The successful 
manipulator abstracts himself from all care about what his activities produce 
other than financial bounties. 
</P>
<P>
If that is not bad enough, a concomitant decay in the quality of life comes 
about because of treating other people impersonally. The hidden side of the 
shiny coin of individualism is the bleak refusal to consider questions of the 
humanity of others, let alone questions of social justice. To put it bluntly: 
There is no evidence that anywhere in the Western democracies where political 
theories justify the cultivation of individualism is there any instance where 
the vigorous freedom of a market economy is compatible with giving a damn about 
anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, treating everyone else in an impersonal way -- as a 
functionary, i.e., as a means of performing some work function -- rather than 
as a complex whole human being relieves the politically free and enterprising 
consumer-producer-manipulator from all concerns about the well-being of others. 
</P>
<P>
If you new free marketeers come into the West with your eyes open to the human 
dangers and drawbacks of the long run as well as to the personal advantages and 
satisfactions of the short, then the new blood you bring with you could even 
help us reorder our good and bad news.

A University of California vice-chancellor was on the phone the other day 
recruiting a $100,000 scholar. Once upon a simpler time, only professors in 
business schools, medical schools and law schools could command such major 
academic salaries -- along with chancellors, vice chancellors and deans. Not 
these days. Free-agent humanists, like free-agent shortstops, are demanding 
upper incomes, too. 
</P>
<P>
Philosophers now find themselves in bidding wars for wise men with big names -- 
the university equivalent of "Star Search." 
</P>
<P>
This might seem silly to CEO headhunters or agents for athletes and 
entertainers, since the upper ranges of academic salaries are still much less 
than a successful Vegas lounge act will draw, not to mention an arbitrager or a 
kid fresh out of law school. But the fact is, having joined the money game, 
institutions of higher education display a greater love of reputation than a 
love of learning. The values of the star system corrode the life of mind. 
</P>
<P>
Plato wrote in "Republic" that the pursuit of wisdom was incompatible with the 
pursuit of fortune and glory. Try telling that to today's marketable humanists. 
Plato thought the effort necessary for achieving understanding was 
all-consuming, as it is with earning money or politics. The consolation of 
philosophy was supposed to be the wisdom it brought, wisdom that made public 
reputation or private wealth pale by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
So it was no accident that the scholar's life had always been a modest one. 
Throughout the Middle Ages, most scholars never married. They were poor. The 
1950s college teacher who wore out his corduroys was respected because of what 
that shiny seat said about his dedication. In time, as salaries rose, college 
teachers joined the middle class -- often apologetically. 
</P>
<P>
All this has now changed. The consolation of the academic life in higher 
education is no longer as rewarding as higher compensation. Then, when the push 
for pay begins, the pursuit of wisdom turns into a scramble for reputation. The 
importance of the classroom, higher education's high purpose, fades. 
</P>
<P>
A six-figure scholar is not the sort to spend his time grading papers or 
correcting student grammar. He or she is likely to demand a teaching load of a 
couple of courses a year, maybe less. Most of the major players prefer to teach 
the same old thing, at least to undergraduates. A UCLA philosopher tells me 
that he prepares his lectures on the way to class. University professors are 
more like talking heads than the real teachers who do all those boring things 
like writing comments on term papers or keeping office hours. And students who 
once wrote 25-page papers now do five-page briefs -- so much easier to read. 
</P>
<P>
An eminent British philologist describes his teaching in America as being on 
sabbatical. 
</P>
<P>
Established scholars devote their time to research, where they spend more time 
writing than reading, because reading is too time-consuming. Scholars simply 
could not write as often as they do if they had time for reading, too. To read 
everything that's been written, on whatever topic, would leave no time to 
publish one's own views. Consequently, the new way to read a book is to scan a 
book review or else read a single chapter, for cocktail party understanding. 
Salary and reputation cannot wait for years of contemplation. Yet distinguished 
journals often have subscription lists of less than 500 institutions and 
individuals; the publishing runs of prestigious academic presses can be even 
smaller. Scholarly writing is now a form of advertising, more to sell the 
scholar than ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Since professors are reading less, as more is being written, those on the way 
to fame and richness must parlay academic reputations by cultivating the VIPs 
-- Very Important Professors. This self-appointed group of scholars, at the 
better schools, are the arbiters of academic appointments all across the 
nation. Their judgment is trusted by those who have never read their work, who 
only know their fine reputations. 
</P>
<P>
We have a self-fulfilling cycle: Important scholars are important because they 
are said to be important by important scholars. This is most true of 
interpretive academic disciplines that have no independent measure, where 
professors are the measure of all things, functioning like literary critics. 
There are, doubtlessly, exceptions, but a scientist at Cal Tech recently told 
me that this is even how the Nobel Prize is won. It could, of course, be sour 
grapes. Yet wisdom does not lend itself to lists. Scholarship is more of a 
collegial, communal effort -- at least it ought to be. 
</P>
<P>
None of this enhances public confidence in higher education or in the use of 
taxes that pay those fancy salaries -- or the tuitions people pay to put their 
kids through school. Private liberal arts colleges may still do a good 
classroom job because their support depends on a loyal, generous alumni. In the 
public sector, the quality of undergraduate instruction is too often 
compromised; educated students are far less important in the scheme of pay and 
perquisites than the esteem of peers. A well-known linguist, teaching at an 
Eastern college, recently turned down big bucks from the University of 
California because he found undergraduate instruction so appalling and the 
faculty so indifferent to instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Presidents of public universities claim that they have to pay to field a 
distinguished faculty. They must compete for scholars if the campus reputation 
is to thrive. Research universities focus on graduate programs, training 
grounds for the next generation of scholars and college teachers. Scholars with 
reputations are said to be necessities as drawing cards for students. But as 
the quality of undergraduate instruction fades, so does the product of graduate 
schools -- Ph.D. dissertations little better than Master's theses, not to 
mention students without values. I suspect public campuses and even graduate 
schools would do better with professors dedicated to the life of the open mind 
rather than the open market. 
</P>
<P>
The baseball analogy proves instructive. Before free agency reached 1980s 
frenzy, only a superstar could command a few million dollars. Now someone who 
hits .250 does. The same phenomenon, minus a couple of zeros, will repeat 
itself with academic salaries as those scholars of repute discover the rewards 
of speed on the career paths. But how to measure a free-agent scholar? Where 
are the stats for a heavy-hitting historian? A smooth-fielding philosopher? The 
pursuit of wisdom has no box score. 
</P>
<P>
Higher education is best approached from the bottom up, not top down, by 
providing decent wages and working conditions to grammar school teachers first. 
That's where the real work begins. Distributing money more diffusely would also 
help, emphasizing community colleges and four year schools, instead of pouring 
so much of the pot into elite universities and the favored few. 
</P>
<P>
Directors of foundations and dispensers of federal grants who share complaints 
about America's universities ought to reexamine how they distribute funds, 
whether they themselves have been playing the fame-fortune game. The money 
given out, with all the best intentions, may be partly to blame for the loss of 
values in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The great American superstar may be a natural in left field but he doesn't have 
a key position in the lecture hall. Educators ought to be coaching students to 
write real papers for real teachers who will really read them. 
</P>
<P>
America has the best universities money can buy; that may be the problem.

In response to "Action vs. Words" letter of Dec. 28, it is ridiculous to 
compare the actions of the U.S. in Panama to the Soviet Union's use of tanks in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
To say our force was "against the citizens of Panama City" is outrageous. The 
purpose of the U.S. was to oust a drug-dealing military dictator who defied the 
will of the people in the May election. In my opinion, this action is the 
opposite from Stalinist repression that took place over the past few decades.

I couldn't believe Alan Dershowitz saying "international law may forbid us from 
physically entering the nunciature. . . ." ("Justice for Noriega Isn't in the 
Cards," Op-Ed Page, Jan. 2). International law? He's got to be kidding. 
</P>
<P>
International law prohibits us from invading another country, too. It forbids 
us to ransack another country's embassy. Since when did the United States obey 
international law? 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, we don't even obey our own laws. Our Constitution says the 
right to declare war belongs to Congress, but we let our presidents usurp this 
power any time they like by simply calling war by another name. Let's face it, 
if sending 24,000 troops over another country's borders, guns blazing, isn't an 
act of war, then absolutely nothing is. 
</P>
<P>
Get real, Dershowitz. International law is the last thing that kept us out of 
the nunciature. Now, fear of worldwide outrage, that's another matter. It's too 
bad Americans aren't capable of outrage any more. If they were, they might 
demand their government return to the rule of law.

REPUBLICANS AND ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. Deukmejian demonstrated that he is truly a lame-duck leader. 
</P>
<P>
By recommending that Republican anti-choice candidates stick to their 
traditional positions on reproductive freedom issues, he has relegated the 
Republican Party to permanent minority status in California and in the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 Harris poll showed that 68% of all registered Republicans would oppose a 
constitutional amendment banning access to abortion. GOP anti-choice candidates 
will continue to lose if they don't recognize this important fact. 
</P>
<P>
The governor is right, abortion is a moral issue, but the Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services Supreme Court decision guaranteed that it is also 
a political issue. If Republicans heed Deukmejian's advice, there is no future 
for our party in leading California.

In trying to explain the United States illegal break-in of the Nicaraguan 
envoy's residence, President Bush said, " . . . Makes you wonder what our young 
men are up against down there" (Part A, Dec. 31). This from a man who sent 
24,000 soldiers, armed with the most advanced killing tools, to a foreign 
country, which primarily accomplished the killing of Panamanians.

This is kinder and gentler? It sounds like something Adolph Hitler might have

BUCHANAN ON MONROE DOCTRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I cannot refrain from writing this letter after reading the drivel by Patrick 
Buchanan ("The Monroe Doctrine: Use It or Lose It," Opinion, Dec. 31). I am not 
syndicated, I'm simply a retired educator. 
</P>
<P>
But I can recognize dangerously foolish ideas when they are put forth. 
</P>
<P>
Buchanan obviously has not done any homework on the Monroe Doctrine. This 
document does not permit the United States to run rampant over any country in 
this hemisphere. Its intent was and is to prevent foreign powers from 
interfering with American countries. 
</P>
<P>
Then Buchanan discusses the true threats to our vital interests. He doesn't 
discuss what are our "vital interests," but he does mention Nicaragua, a small 
country with a population total of roughly 3.5 million people. (That's less 
than the population of greater Los Angeles.) And this country is threatening 
the United States? 
</P>
<P>
Then Buchanan mentions the "impressive display of U.S. power." The only 
successes this great fighting machine has experienced have been the conquering 
of Grenada (population under 100,000) and Panama (a grand population total of a 
little over 2 million). And both of these invasions were botched, succeeding 
only because of sheer numbers. 
</P>
<P>
How about the disaster in Lebanon, Mr. Buchanan? And the horror we are bringing 
to El Salvador? Yes, under President Reagan the defense establishment managed 
to spend trillions of dollars, leaving a debt which every American will have to 
face sooner or later. 
</P>
<P>
To quote again, "Was it not worth it?" 
</P>
<P>
Need I answer that, Mr. Buchanan?

SAVING CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The commentary "We Could Give the Gift of Life This Christmas" (Op-Ed Page, 
Dec. 24) outraged and dismayed me. To allow 40,000 children to needlessly die 
daily is literally beyond belief! But even if we do not respond to this 
unnecessary condition on humane grounds, it well behooves us to look at it from 
a selfish stance. 
</P>
<P>
High child death rates mean high birth rates; the poverty which promotes these 
death rates forces millions to over-exploit their surroundings just to survive; 
poverty provokes instability and violence; poverty perpetuates itself. It sows 
the seeds of social problems. We feel the results of all of this in our own 
country. So for either selfish or unselfish reasons, we must realize that 
children are indeed dying for us to learn this.

Buchanan's article ended the year on a shrill note, if not a high one. 
</P>
<P>
He states that the diplomats in the Organization of American States and those 
in the United Nations condemn our invasion of Panama, but privately agree with 
our actions. If this is true (an unprovable allegation), why? Could they fear 
the reaction of their citizens? That is sometimes known as democracy, a system 
I thought we espoused. 
</P>
<P>
Leave the OAS, advises Buchanan, and reassert the Monroe Doctrine. That oughta 
do it! We could call it a Martial Plan for Latin America!

OUTTAKES: STILL SEAWORTHY?

"Now, Voyager" -- the 1942 Bette Davis classic in which she utters the famed 
closing line, "Don't let's ask for the moon -- we have the stars" -- may be 
casting off for a remake. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz harpist/producer Corky Hale and literary agent Shirley Strick have 
acquired remake rights to the sudser from Turner Entertainment, and are about 
to assign a writer through Magnus Films. 
</P>
<P>
And already, claims Hale, there's been interest from the reps of such actresses 
as Kathleen Turner and Jessica Lange. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is say 'Now, Voyager' and there's instant recognition," 
said Hale, who's married to Mike Stoller of the songwriting team of (Jerry) 
Leiber &amp; Stoller ("Hound Dog," "Is That All There Is"). 
</P>
<P>
Recall the plot: an ugly duckling spinster (with a cold-hearted mother) 
transforms herself into a swan, sets sail on an ocean cruise, meets and falls 
in love with a married man -- who can't leave his wife. (As Davis' true love, 
Paul Henreid proves adept at lighting two cigarettes simultaneously.) 
</P>
<P>
Isn't that storyline a bit creaky for the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, come on!" Hale countered. "Ask around and you'll find plenty of women 
today who are involved with married men who for one reason or other can't leave 
their wives. This story is as timely as ever. 
</P>
<P>
"The domineering mother is also timeless. Right now, we plan to make ours 
similar to Leona Helmsley -- she'll be a tyrant who's also a successful 
businesswoman." Pat H. Broeske

<P>
Late last year, when programmer Richard Skorman opened submissions for the 
First U.S. Environmental Film Festival, he admits that he was "fearful we 
wouldn't get enough entries." Now, with 138 films and videos submitted from 
around the world and a total of 200-250 anticipated, "the problem is selecting 
the final (50-60) films." 
</P>
<P>
The nonprofit festival, to be held in Colorado Springs April 27-29, just after 
the 20th anniversary celebration of Earth Day on April 22, will award cash 
prizes for films and videos of varied lengths, both animated and live action. 
Requirement: They must have been filmed after Jan. 1, 1987, with ecological 
themes or backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
Skorman noted that "some great animated movies are coming in," but expressed 
disappointment about fictional possibilities. He'd hoped to have the 
"Chinatown" sequel, "Two Jakes," a mystery revolving around oil rights, but the 
film's tentative March 30 release date would preclude that. 
</P>
<P>
Skorman is negotiating for "Mindwalk," an independent feature that discourses 
on the state of the world. Otherwise, he has no fictional films lined up that 
involve environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
"There's supposedly a big push in Hollywood to make them," he said, "but 
there's nothing coming out in the next few months that we're aware of." John M.

POP FACES: HUGH HARRIS IS BEYOND CATEGORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Black people hurt white people. . . . White people hurt black people. . . . 
White people help black people. . . . Black people don't like white people. . . 
. White people don't like black people. . . . And on and on." 
</P>
<P>
English singer/songwriter Hugh Harris spat out those lines with increasing 
speed and fury, like a rapper out of control. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who's of Jamacian ancestry, was making a point about daily life 
festering with subtle racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like them," said Harris, 25, whose first album, Capitol's "Words for 
Our Years," is just out. "I don't let those tensions consume me. I don't write 
a lot about race. That would be boring. But being aware of racial tensions 
makes you sharp, it heightens your sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that explains why his lyrics seem so full of insight and teem with such 
passion. His music doesn't comfortably fit any category -- it's moody and 
soulful, laced with rock and folk. His best songs, characterized by his 
helter-skelter phrasing, are sad, somewhat bitter commentaries on the human 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do music that can be easily categorized," he pointed out. "Where's 
the challenge? I never want to do music that every one else is doing. I'd die 
of boredom." 
</P>
<P>
Capitol Records took quite a chance on Harris, who has been involved in music 
only since the mid-'80s. It's the latest in a series of careers that Harris, 
who's from east London, has dabbled in since he left school at 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I've tried this and that but nothing seemed right," he said. "Music was just 
something to do. I never planned a career. I had been writing stuff down as 
songs since I was 20 but I'm not really a musician. But I gave myself a crash 
course when I had to learn certain things about music. I play a little piano, a 
little bass, a little guitar, but I'm not great at anything." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his limited musical experience, Capitol, which signed him because of 
his impressive songwriting, eventually let him co-produce his debut album. "I 
wanted a hand in the production," he said. "I was afraid they might try to 
commercialize my music and fit me in this black category." 
</P>
<P>
To counter any preconceptions about his music, Harris didn't want his picture 
on the album cover, which features just a silhouette of him. "If they see a 
black face, they expect a certain kind of music," he explained. "If they see no 
face, they'll take the music on its face value. I want people to listen to this 
album without preconceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Releasing a faceless album, however, is not a particularly wise marketing 
strategy. "Who cares about marketing?," he said disdainfully. "If people like 
the album, they like it. If they don't they don't. I don't worry about 
marketing." 
</P>
<P>
Harris doesn't worry about his music career either. 
</P>
<P>
"If it doesn't work out I'll do something else," he said matter-of-factly. "I 
just need to express myself creatively -- somehow. I know that about myself. I 
don't have to be in the music business to do that. If I was never in the music 
business ever again I'm not sure that I'd miss it." DENNIS HUNT

POP FACES: 'CITY BOY' IAN HUNTER RETURNS TO HIS ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in the early '80s, Ian Hunter was more like landed gentry than the 
street-rocker he had been in his younger days. He was living in the country in 
Upstate New York, breeding German shepherds -- and watching his music go down 
the tubes. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think there's any energy in the air. It must be in the air," said 
the veteran rocker, whose erratic solo career has yet to eclipse his tenure 
with the storied British band Mott the Hoople. "In the city there's more energy 
in the air. See, when I was in Mott I'd always written the songs in a little 
apartment in London, and it just seems to work better. I moved into Manhattan 
around '86, and then I wrote 'Big Time,' and I thought, 'Well, that's the first 
decent song that I can put on a record.' " 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's urban renewal plan has led to his re-teaming with his longtime 
sidekick, guitarist Mick Ronson, and to their record deal with PolyGram, which 
recently released their album "Y U I Orta" -- Hunter's first record in six 
years. Perhaps more important, it revived the spirit of this classic rock 'n' 
roller. 
</P>
<P>
With his red ringlets and ever-present shades, the Englishman cut a Dickensian 
figure as he led the star-crossed Mott the Hoople through the 
late-'60s/early-'70s rock crusades. 
</P>
<P>
The band, cynical and softhearted, hard-bitten and romantic, supplied 
much-needed urgency and challenge to a largely sterile scene. In the personnel 
department, its internal workings were a study in contradictions, a prototype 
for the conflicting forces and thrilling instability that would later make 
bands like the Clash, the Replacements and Guns N' Roses so fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, Mott ended up with the respect of the punk generation that rejected 
so many of the group's contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
"They were all-encompassing," said Hunter, reflecting on his old band's appeal. 
"They had their heavy-metal side, what's called heavy metal now. We never 
called it that then. They had their kind of glam side and they had their punk 
side. If you listen to 'Brain Capers,' if you listen to 'Moon Upstairs,' it's 
kinda like listening to the Pistols before it ever happened. 
</P>
<P>
"We were genuine. I knew what I was talking about when I did lyrics 'cause I'd 
been in the factories. I was straight out of 'em. Had a lot to talk about. Mick 
Ralphs was a tasty guitar player at a time when there weren't too many tasty 
guitar players around. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a combination of assets. I don't think as a band it was that great 
musically. It just seemed to have a lot of things going for it." 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 years after Mott's origins, Hunter is more sure than ever about 
what he's doing -- "Especially if people keep on churning out the crap they're 
churning out. I mean, one of the reasons I came back was 'cause I lay on the 
bed and watched MTV and moaned at everything I saw, 'til my wife turned around 
and said, 'Well why don't you go out and do something about it instead of just 
moaning?' 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, there's nothin' out there like me. Maybe there shouldn't be, but I 
just feel there should be." RICHARD CROMELIN

<P>
Artists will attest that there is much more to their profession than simply 
creating art. In fact, a good portion of many artists' time is spent applying 
for, and nervously waiting to hear if they have received, grants from such 
institutions as the California Arts Council or the Los Angeles Endowment for 
the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
With 1990 deadlines for grants looming on the near horizon, a number of 
institutions are offering grant workshops and other guidance for artists who 
are unfamiliar or seek assistance with the application process. 
</P>
<P>
* The Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, which administers the L.A. 
Endowment, is holding more than a dozen free workshops to help artists of 
various disciplines apply for the 1990-91 Cultural Grant Program. This year, 
the department expects to top the $2.5 million awarded through the same grant 
program last year. The grants will go to projects in the city of Los Angeles 
that will take place July 1 through June 30, 1991. The application deadline is 
Feb. 28.

</P>
<P>
* At Otis/Parsons Art Institute, a new six-session course, titled "Grant 
Writing Workshop," will be held on Tuesdays, from Jan. 23-Feb. 27, from 7-10 
p.m. Taught by instructor Rodney Sappington, the course will also feature guest

a.m.-1 p.m. on Saturday, and at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design (1700 
Lida St.) from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. on Jan. 20. The workshop, which is designed for 
staff and board members of nonprofit arts organizations, will focus on 
applications for the California Arts Council's Organizational Support Program 
(application deadline is Feb. 1). The cost for the two-part workshop is $50, 
and scholarships are available. For information, or to enroll, call (213) 
627-9276. 
</P>
<P>

Grants and its application procedure will be held at LACE (1804 Industrial 
Street), at 7 p.m. on Monday. The deadline is Feb. 1 for LACE's grant program,

Partnership grants. For information, call (213) 974-1317. 
</P>
<P>
SUPPORT CLASS: Also aiming to help artists with the non-creative aspect of 
their work is "Artists' Career Development Group," a new course through UCLA 
Extension. "This class deals with career how-to issues which are not given a 
great deal of discussion in art school," said the support group's instructor 
Anne Marie Karlson, who is herself an artist and is represented by Los Angeles' 
Newspace Gallery. "Students will learn how to write a resume, to shoot slides 
and set up career goals. They will bring to class examples of their work, and 
we will explore which areas of art are the best for them to pursue." The class 
format will include discussions, written assignments and presentations by art 
professionals. The enrollment fee for the six-month course, which begins 
Wednesday, is $180. The class meets on Wednesdays from 7-10 p.m. and will be 
held in Room 108 of the Westwood United Methodist Church, 10497 Wilshire Blvd. 
Information: (213) 206-8503. 
</P>
<P>
ARTISTS' STUDIOS: Artists who haven't been able to find appropriate studio 
spaces may soon have a new home. Approximately 60,000 square feet for new loft 
and studio spaces are expected to be available in downtown Long Beach by this 
fall. The proposed spaces, which would range from 625 square feet to 2,100 
square feet, will have 14-foot ceilings and natural light. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which is being developed by the Public Corporation for the Arts, 
the Long Beach Regional Arts Council, the city's Redevelopment Agency and 
M.C.&amp; D. Capital Corp., is located in the historic Walker Building, a 
four-story structure at 401 Pine Ave. The building was originally designed and 
built by Meyer and Holler, architects of the famed Grauman's Chinese Theater in 
Hollywood. 
</P>

CUISINES OF LIBERATION; 
</P>
<P>
THE FARE OF EASTERN EUROPE IS AS CLOSE AS VINE STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MAX JACOBSON

<TEXT>
<P>
Children in Bucharest taste oranges for the first time. Geese cackle in the 
streets of Prague. In Budapest, pastry kitchens bustle with a vibrant hum. And 
in Warsaw, working-class families are putting meat in their iron pots. So as we 
move into the new year, is there a better way to celebrate change in Eastern 
Europe than with a taste of these newly liberated cuisines here? 
</P>
<P>
ROMANIA 
</P>
<P>
Mignon European Restaurant, 1253 Vine St., Hollywood. (213) 461-4192. Open for 
lunch Tuesday through Friday and Sunday, dinner Tuesday through Sunday. Beer 
and wine only. Parking in lot. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, 
food only, $20-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Mignon European Restaurant, Los Angeles' best and most elegant Romanian 
restaurant, is owned by Felicia Zanescu, a Carpathian Perle Mesta who greets 
everyone warmly at the door. When asked why she called her restaurant 
"European," she replied, "Who ever heard of Romania?" But that was last year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the mood is bittersweet at Mignon. Christmas decorations are still up, 
and a full-scale band plays dance music on weekends. And despite the euphoria 
of liberation, the changes have been so sudden, and the revelations so 
overwhelming, that the emigre community that frequents the restaurant sits 
quietly. They enjoy the native specialties, smiling reservedly and talking 
about the future. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Danescu, a vice president at First Interstate Bank, is optimistic. 
"Romanians are clever people," he says, "they'll adjust quickly." Paul 
Florescu, a one-time urologist now in electronics, is not so sure. "I'm 
crossing my fingers," he says. "Because the situation was so extreme the 
reaction may be extreme too." 
</P>
<P>
Romanians serve the only cuisine east of Vienna that's so light most of us 
could eat it on a daily basis. Romanians are Latins, but their cuisine is 
Balkan. The food at Mignon is delicate, with subtle hints of Turkish, Russian 
and Viennese influences. 
</P>
<P>
You'll want to start with two appetizers ideal for spreading on the house brown 
bread: icre, a creamy dip made from the roe of carp, and vinete, a garlicky 
eggplant pate. Fasole, a white bean broth with dill, yellow peppers and tomato, 
is one of most perfect soups I've ever tasted. Cashcaval pane is a pungent, 
fried soft cheese with a schnitzel-style breading, the perfect complement for 
Romanian wine. 
</P>
<P>
"Romanians love wine spritzers," says Zanescu. They especially love it made out 
of one of the good dry Rieslings from Romania's Tarnave Castle. 
</P>
<P>
Mamaliga, a golden yellow cornmeal porridge, is the staple of the Romanian 
diet. At Mignon you eat it with brinza, grated feta cheese, and smitina, thick 
sour cream. (It's much lighter than it sounds.) 
</P>
<P>
So are wonderful sarmale, cabbage rolls stuffed with a liver mixture, and 
mititei, juicy, skinless sausages made from ground lamb and grilled on a 
brazier. The sausages are pungent, powerful fare, a perfect foil for the 
restaurant's homemade pickled tomatoes. Finish with dessert crepes wrapped 
around sour cherries called clatite, and cups of muddy Turkish coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Service at Mignon is sheer delight. Waiters speak remarkably good English (two 
I met had been here less than one year) and are unfailingly polite, pouring 
wine and brushing off tables with extraordinary grace. 
</P>
<P>
And Zanescu plays no favorites. I'm told even the visiting king (in exile) was 
made to wait for a table on a busy Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: white caviar, $4.95; eggplant salad, $5.75; casccaval 
pane, $6.75; sarmale, $9.25; mamaliga cu brinza si smitina, $6.25. 
</P>
<P>
CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
</P>
<P>
 Matuszeks Czechoslovak Cuisine, 7513 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood. (213) 
874-0106. Open for dinner Tuesday through Sunday. Beer and wine only. Street 
parking. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $25-50. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an American now," says 11-year-old George Matuszek proudly, admitting 
that he has no plans to return to his native Czechoslovakia. George, who serves 
the food that his parents cook at the family restaurant, has been in the U.S. 
since he was 3. "And besides," he adds, "it's cold over there." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Czechoslovakia is such a cold country accounts for the heaviness 
of the food. Plenty of meats and gravies are consumed, mopped up with disc-like 
flour dumplings called knedlicky. George insisted I order svickova na smetane, 
marinated beef in a sour cream sauce with knedlicky and cranberries, and in 
doing so won my undying friendship. His mother's dumplings were heavenly. 
</P>
<P>
You might want to start with domaci pastika, a fine, fatty veal pate served 
loaf-style alongside dishes of mustard and pickles. You eat it with dark 
Bohemian rye bread, and wash it down with Pilsner Urquell, a Czech beer that is 
unquestionably one of the world's finest. Another compelling starter is Prague 
borscht, the hot beet soup with sour cream, here in a chicken-based broth with 
lots of slivered meat. 
</P>
<P>
Czech food is simpler than that of its neighbors, leaning heavily toward 
Austria and Hungary. Moravsky vrabec, from the Matuszeks' home province of 
Moravia, is chunked pork with a wonderful sauerkraut. 
</P>
<P>
Desserts are good at Matuszeks. They include an apple strudel (which relies on 
crushed almonds) and a wonderful concoction called Lidia's sinful cheesecake, a 
rich, airy confection that almost floats up to your mouth. You might call it 
unbearably light. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: domaci pastika, $4.95; Prague borscht, $3.95; svickova na 
smetane, $12.95; pecena kachna, $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
HUNGARY 
</P>
<P>
Hortobagy, 11138 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 980-2273. Open for lunch and 
dinner Tuesday-Sunday. Beer and wine only. Street parking. Cash only. Dinner 
for two, food only, $20-40. 
</P>
<P>
 Light is not the word for Hungarian cuisine, the best of which still relies on 
lard. This gives it a rich heaviness and a gusto for which there is no 
substitute. 
</P>
<P>
At Hortobagy in Studio City, you can experience authentic Hungarian cooking; no 
compromise, no fear, no vegetable oils. I cannot eat this food often, but when 
I'm in the mood I can think of nothing more satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Hortobagy is modest. Tables are stuck together mess-hall style, with a few 
booths for the lucky against a rear wall. You don't have to worry about 
eavesdropping, because most of the conversation is in Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
The food is csodalatos -- sensational. My unquestioned favorite is disznotoros, 
the farmer's plate, which includes hurka, a grilled sausage filled with a liver 
and rice stuffing; kolbasz, a red sausage redolent of garlic and paprika; 
smoke-flavored stewed pork in massive white chunks and a heap of roughly mashed 
potato with chopped onion. 
</P>
<P>
Another dish that won't make it onto La Costa's menu this year is the 
restaurant's paprikas csirke, the classic chicken paprika. Pieces of chicken 
are cooked in lard with sour cream and paprika and served over tiny flour 
dumplings. Have it with the pungent house cucumber salad, or red cabbage 
flavored with caraway seed. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the most famous Hungarian dish of all, goulash soup, is by no 
means as hearty as other dishes. It's really a light beef broth with potatoes, 
carrot, dumplings and boiled beef. The kitchen actually uses very little 
paprika in their version. 
</P>
<P>
I consider Hungarian desserts the best in the world. Hortobagy doesn't do 
anything to change my mind. Try the chestnut cream torte, the crepes with 
apricot and crushed walnut, the seven-layer chocolate squares. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: farmer's goulash soup, $6.15; farmer's plate, $9.85; 
Hortobagy wooden platter (serves two), $23.80; Hungarian crepes, $1.50; 
chestnut torte, $3.65. 
</P>
<P>
POLAND 
</P>
<P>
Warszawa, 1414 Lincoln Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 393-8831. Open daily for 
dinner. Full bar. Parking in lot. All major cards. Dinner for two, food only, 
$40-$60. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the people I met last week, Adam Kowalski, a Pole living in the San 
Fernando Valley, summed up the general feeling of Eastern Europeans best. "I 
always knew we would be free someday," he said with mild disbelief, "but I 
didn't think it would happen so suddenly." 
</P>
<P>
Warszawa (pronounced Var-schav-ah), is the best place to celebrate this sudden 
freedom. That is because it is the best Eastern European restaurant in Los 
Angeles. A converted house with a series of small, intimate dining rooms, it 
offers service performed by an all-Polish staff and food that is 
extraordinarily refined and appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Begin with ryba w galarecie, fish in a delicately seasoned aspic, or watrobka 
po Polsku, a delightfully rich liver pate. 
</P>
<P>
As a second course, the combination salad plate is one of the best dishes I've 
had anywhere: pomidorowa, tomatoes and scallions with warmed Polish goat 
cheese; warszawa, an arresting compote of sauerkraut, apples and carrots; 
mizeria, cucumber, lemon and dill, and z czerwonej kapusty, red cabbage with 
leeks and walnuts. 
</P>
<P>
Main courses include kaczka z jablkami, one of the city's best roast ducklings 
(all crispy skin with dumplings and spiced apples); kolduny, tiny lamb 
dumplings, a dish said to have originated in Lithuania, or placki, wafer-thin 
potato pancakes served with dried plums. 
</P>
<P>
Don't miss the restaurant's Polish aperitifs or after-dinner drinks, either. 
Zydnia is icy-cold rye vodka downed from a shot glass. Krupnik is a mead-like 
liqueur. 
</P>
<P>
Among Warszawa's wonderful desserts is one compelling choice, deser 
solidarnosc. This is a poached pear placed amid two dramatically contrasting 
sauces. One is a white thick vanilla cream sauce, the other a red cranberry 
kisiel (a thickened fruit sauce made with potato flour.) Solidarity colors! How 
could any patriot, Polish or American, think of ordering anything else? 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended dishes: ryba w galarecie, $5.25; combination salad, $7; zrazy, 
beef roulade, $14.95; kolduny, $14.75; kaczka z jablkami, $17.

'TOUGH LOVE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Obviously, P. Lucius Sladek Jr. and Frank L. Burke, whose Dec. 24 letters 
blasted Bill Cosby, have had radically different experiences with dishonest 
and/or addicted children than I have had. 
</P>
<P>
Having seen "open-minded and understanding" parents give unlimited support and 
love in a frustrating and fruitless effort to help offspring salvage their 
lives, I feel I can comment knowledgeably on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
My well-meaning parents' never-ending efforts to help those who "strayed from 
the mold" have drained and disrupted four generations; one after another, the 
children and grandchildren were affected by the tumultuous household. 
</P>
<P>
It is not easy to use the "tough love" method, but the survival of a whole 
family must be considered.

TASTE MAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Dec. 24 article "The Eighties Taste Makers," Calendar writer Lawrence 
Christon selected Eddie Murphy and Roseanne Barr to represent comedy. These 
choices seem to relate to Christon's reference to "seething mean-spiritedness" 
in his Page 3 article in the same issue, "Putting the '80s Behind Us." 
</P>
<P>
Barr has announced that she will stop male-bashing in her stand-up routines. 
Murphy, however, has carried his old-fashioned female-bashing from the verbal 
to the physical in his misogynic movie fantasy, "Harlem Nights." 
</P>
<P>
The Murphy item in "Taste Makers" states that "his stardom had nothing to do 
with the small range of his acting." If Mr. Christon had wished to mention 
comedians who are also talented actors, he could have chosen Oscar nominees 
Robin Williams and Whoopi Goldberg or Steve Martin. Robin and Whoopi also 
deserve credit for their humanitarian efforts.

FIT TO GUIDE?

<TEXT>

The film critics of The Times have picked the best films of the '80s ("Films of 
the '80s -- Critics Recall the Best," Dec. 24). Sheila Benson says that this 
"was one of the sorriest decades in the annals of film." 
</P>
<P>
I too would yet consider this a sorry decade if I believed that the films cited 
by the Times' critics were indeed the best. Look at the choices! 
</P>
<P>
Peter Rainer, Kevin Thomas and Michael Wilmington chose 19 foreign films among 
their 30 choices. They include such films as "The Makioka Sisters," 
"Himatsuri," "The Legend of Surami Fortress" and "Heimat." 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that in the lists of Benson, Rainer, Thomas and Wilmington 
only one of the 10 top-grossing films of the decade ("E.T.") receives any 
mention. 
</P>
<P>
One no longer expects that film critics will share the preferences of the 
filmgoing public for whom reviews are written. But even such commercial and 
critical successes as "Rain Man," "Amadeus," "Chariots of Fire" and "Platoon" 
receive no mention at all on the Times' critics lists. 
</P>
<P>
Some unquestionably good films ("E.T.," "Hannah and Her Sisters," "Raging 
Bull") do make the lists, but the most-mentioned film of all is "Blue Velvet," 
a film Benson calls "a stylized vision of the rot below." 
</P>
<P>
How can readers of The Times who are looking for guidance on what films to see 
rely on the judgment of a group of critics whose taste in films range from the 
totally obscure ("Heimat") to the utterly strange ("Blue Velvet")?

<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to Dennis Hunt ("Times' Critics' Best Albums of the '80s," Dec. 24). 
</P>
<P>
Of the 12 "critics" who chose their favorite albums, only Hunt included George 
Michael's "Faith." 
</P>
<P>
Beside being one of the best-selling records of this decade, it gave George 
Michael three American Music Awards and a Grammy for album of the year, it was 
the No. 1 album for several weeks and it had several No. 1 singles. 
</P>
<P>
I think it's about time people started rating records on public response and 
not solely on critical acclaim.

I am disgusted by the fact that in this day of struggle to raise the human 
above pervasive barbarism, a film that is a paean to the hypocritical morality 
of the Reagan era and a total putdown of people's attempts to better their 
lives through the recently won privilege of ending a destructive legalized 
relationship, can be not only lavishly produced but brilliantly marketed and 
touted as Oscar material. Wake me up when it's over.

THEATER NOTEBOOK: NEW ROLE TAKES VIC TAYBACK BACK TO ORIGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Vic Tayback moves further away from the all-American Mel of "Alice's" with his 
role as the Lebanese immigrant Youssef Joseph in S.K. Hershewe's comedy, "An 
Oasis in Manhattan," opening Jan. 19 at the Venture Theatre in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
"The 'oasis' is Youssef's household," explained Tayback, "and he runs it like a 
dictator. He loves the United States -- he voted for Eisenhower, Nixon and 
Reagan -- and thinks that freedom, education and democracy are a good idea. But 
there are also some things from the Lebanese tradition that he thinks need to 
be upheld. Like when it comes to marriage, he wants his daughters marrying 
Lebanese." 
</P>
<P>
The actor, whose own background is Syrian ("the cultures are very close"), 
finds the character colorful and likable -- and understands his cultural 
clannishness. 
</P>
<P>
"Those kinds of attitudes are a universal thing," he said. "People come over 
from another country and try to hold onto things from there. Youssef is 
definitely bigoted, but it's not against any particular race. He talks about 
Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Swedes, Italians, Irish and Turks -- basically anybody 
who isn't Lebanese isn't OK. The play's message is that it's the kids who are 
going to take us away from that prejudice." 
</P>

BRADLEY ADOPTING NEW STANCE ON GROWTH; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE MAYOR, HERETOFORE STRONGLY PRO-DEVELOPMENT, VOICES OPPOSITION 
TO TWO HUGE PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years a champion of powerful real estate developers, Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley twice in the last month has spoken out against big developments, 
inviting the question of how much he is willing to break with the past as he 
struggles to regain the public's good will. 
</P>
<P>
Last week Bradley urged the city attorney to join a homeowners' lawsuit 
opposing a planned 875,000-square-foot commercial project at the Santa Monica 
Airport. Last month, he moved to scale down the huge Porter Ranch project 
proposed for the West San Fernando Valley by Nathan Shapell, a developer who 
has contributed more than $40,000 to Bradley over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
With the City Council frequently acquiescing in developers' plans, the 
development issue gives Bradley a chance to seize the political initiative at a 
time when he badly needs to reassert his leadership -- after a year in which 
the mayor spent much of his time answering charges of unethical behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley's aides say the mayor's recent positions -- each delivered with no 
small amount of public relations fanfare -- should be seen as a signal that the 
mayor is prepared to take a more aggressive stand against some development. 
</P>
<P>
"If it means intervening in the case of an individual project, the mayor is 
capable of doing it and willing to do it," said Mark Fabiani, Bradley's new 
chief of staff. "When he stands up with a homeowners' group or publicizes a 
lawsuit he supports, he can have a unique impact on public policy." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the mayor's actions have aroused more skepticism than optimism 
among veterans of the neighborhood battles over growth -- confrontations that 
often have seen Bradley using his influence on behalf of developers. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor is taking a lot of heat for his various improprieties. So, he's 
jumping in on the side of the citizens, saying, 'Look at what a good guy I am!' 
But he's not coming to grips with the problems," said Gordon Murley, president 
of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns., the largest organization of 
homeowner groups in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Other critics of the mayor point out that, although he opposed development in 
Santa Monica, he remained silent about a major project in his own back yard, a 
massive office complex just west of the Harbor Freeway that the City Council 
approved in December over strenuous objections of the city planning staff. 
</P>
<P>
The critics also point out that despite his reservations about Porter Ranch, 
Bradley never objected to the size of the mammoth project. 
</P>
<P>
A true indication of the mayor's resolve, they say, will be whether Bradley 
chooses to contest controversial projects in the city's Fairfax District and on 
the western edge of the expanding downtown. 
</P>
<P>
There, proposed developments pose a formidable challenge to streets, sewers and 
air quality that are already severely overtaxed. Moreover, they are sectors of 
the city represented by influential council members, who could make life 
miserable for Bradley by harping on questions of financial propriety that the 
mayor is trying to put behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor doesn't have the luxury to antagonize the people who have been more 
than fair to him during the past year," said one member of the council, who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Although many slow-growth activists dismiss the mayor's recent conduct as 
political posturing, he is managing to kindle some expectations. 
</P>
<P>
"We were real pleased that the mayor came out in opposition to Porter Ranch. 
Likewise in Santa Monica," said Diana Plotkin, a leader of a neighborhood 
campaign against two proposed commercial centers near Farmers Market in the 
Fairfax District. "We want to believe that Bradley will be ready to get just as 
tough closer to home." 
</P>
<P>
Plotkin's neighborhood has been a hotbed of homeowner activism for several 
years, and the expected showdown over the Farmers Market development could turn 
out to be one of the most bitter anti-growth struggles in years. The developers 
envision 3 million to 4 million square feet of offices, stores and residences 
in the heart of one of the city's densest and most-traveled neighborhoods. The 
opponents have retained a staff of consultants, including a lawyer, a geologist 
and a traffic consultant, and are girding for a lengthy legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have to file a lawsuit against the city, we will do it," Plotkin said. 
</P>
<P>
Intervention by Bradley could pit him against Council President John Ferraro, 
who represents the Fairfax District. Ferraro is an old political opponent of 
Bradley who has emerged over the years as one of the city's most durable 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"Can we expect to see the mayor take on a regional commercial center in John 
Ferraro's back yard?" asked one member of the council. "Don't bet on it." 
</P>
<P>
Jane Blumenfeld, Bradley's deputy in charge of city planning policy, said the 
mayor will be taking a hard look at the proposals affecting the Farmers Market 
neighborhood, as well as additional developments proposed near Los Angeles 
International Airport and for downtown west of the Harbor Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenfeld's presence in the mayor's office, more than any other single factor, 
explains the optimism that some slow-growth advocates are feeling these days 
about Bradley's policies toward development. 
</P>
<P>
During the 18 months she has been in office, Blumenfeld has been the chief 
architect of a series of initiatives aimed at achieving air quality 
improvement, reduced traffic congestion and better design of new commercial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Blumenfeld was the author of Bradley's 10-point critique of the 
Porter Ranch project, which argued that its spread-out design and separation of 
homes, stores and offices would lead to excessive dependence on the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the mayor's intervention with Porter Ranch say the agreement he 
ultimately reached with Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area where 
the ranch is planned, failed to address the greatest risk posed by the 
development -- the threat of flooding caused by overbuilding in hilly terrain. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor got into it too late and never consulted with the people who were 
most concerned," said Murley of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assns. 
</P>
<P>
"All Bradley did was make an enemy of Bernson, and then realizing the 
foolishness of that, tried to patch it over with a compromise that no one 
liked," said a confidential City Hall source close to the negotiations between 
Bernson and Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Blumenfeld and Fabiani conceded that the mayor's office became involved "too 
late in the process" at Porter Ranch, but they defended the outcome of the 
mayor's intervention. As a result of the Bradley-Bernson compromise, 18% of the 
nearly 4,000 housing units to be built will be set aside for poor people and 
traffic will be limited through a 25% reduction in parking available at a 
planned office complex. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, Fabiani said, the mayor will get involved earlier in projects 
and try to persuade a majority of the council to back him.

RAMS AIM TO CONTINUE FEAST OF EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRENSE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once more, it's the hard way or the causeway for the Rams, who have dragged 
themselves east for the third consecutive weekend after victories over the New 
England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles and Frequent Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams aren't just pushing their luck today against the New York Giants. They 
are trying to keep it from being shoved into a landfill in the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
In two previous weeks, the Rams have defied the odds, their bad-weather rap, 
even the conventional wisdom of Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan, who tongue-lashed them 
for trying to build a better mousetrap on defense. Loose lips sank Buddy. Loose 
safeties sank his quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"They've turned the lights out on all the talkers now," Coach John Robinson 
said last week, sending along best New Year's wishes to ex-playoff coaches Ryan 
and his partner in blabber, former Houston coach Jerry Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, how many times can Robinson's team keep repacking the suitcase? He hopes 
four in all, which would get the Rams into New Orleans with clean socks. 
</P>
<P>
Pipe dream? The 1980 Raiders are the only team to have taken a Super Bowl from 
the wild-card chute. But even they caught a few breaks, playing host to the 
wild-card game against Houston and needing only a commuter flight to San Diego 
for the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
For now, there are no travel or time-zone breaks for the Rams, who kick off 
today at 9:30 a.m., PST, same as last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sleepy going into last week's game," tailback Greg Bell said. "I 
remember after breakfast going back and getting another hour's sleep." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, champions of the NFC East, remember sleeping in at home that 
morning, resting various aches while the Eagles and Rams exchanged welts on 
their television screens. 
</P>
<P>
"I would sooner have the week off and I would sooner play at home," Robinson 
said. "But we've had the great misfortune of having those guys from San 
Francisco in our division, or we probably would have won some division." 
</P>
<P>
So at what disadvantage are the Rams today? Some would say none, given their 
penchant for unpredictability this season and their mastery over the Giants of 
late. The Rams weren't buying into any superiority theories last week, and 
wouldn't have uttered a public peep even if they thought otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a 31-10 victory over an 8-1 team in November is difficult to dismiss, 
especially against a Bill Parcells-coached team. The Giants hadn't absorbed 
such a thrashing since, well, the Rams defeated New York, 45-31, in the 
Meadowlands in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Going back further, the Rams' 21-point win in Anaheim was the worst Giant 
defeat under Parcells since 1984, when San Francisco beat New York, 31-10. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells has agreed to meet the Rams at the Meadowlands despite some ominous 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think history has too much to do with football, as you see 
around the league from time to time," he said. "Witness Pittsburgh and Houston 
last week." 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Parcells isn't worried sick. It's not like the Giants are 
losing to the Rams on last-second field goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' objectives are clear. They want to keep the score down and the Ram 
offense off the field. Parcells doesn't have the weapons to compete with the 
Rams in a shoot-out. What he has is a solid defense and a ball-control offense 
directed by an 11-year veteran quarterback, Phil Simms; a tough inside runner 
in Ottis Anderson, and a big-play rookie, Dave Meggett. 
</P>
<P>
Crucial mistakes buried the Giants in Anaheim, and Parcells said similar 
mistakes will produce a similar score. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were leading, 10-3, just before halftime when quarterback Jim Everett 
threw a 51-yard scoring pass to Aaron Cox, the touchdown made possible when a 
Giant safety slipped on the grass at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett then fumbled the ensuing kickoff, giving the Rams the ball on the Giant 
21 with 36 seconds left in the first half. Everett hit Flipper Anderson with a 
touchdown pass on first down to make it 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells said: "You can't give them 14 points in a one-minute span and spot 
them a 24-3 lead at the half. We probably wouldn't be able to catch up to them 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Simms was hobbling on a bad ankle in that game, also, and wasn't much of a 
factor. With two good legs, you need a stake to finish off Simms, according to 
Robinson, one of the all-time tough guys. 
</P>
<P>
"You get the feeling you're playing against a guy who knows how to play and 
will try to beat you with his last gasp," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants might also hope for a mental lapse the size of one made in the 1984 
wild-card game between the teams at Anaheim Stadium, when Robinson ordered the 
ball given to fullback Dwayne Crutchfield on a crucial call inside the Giants' 
five instead of giving it to Eric Dickerson, who had set the NFL's 
single-season rushing record that season. 
</P>
<P>
Crutchfield was stuffed, and New York won the game, 16-13. 
</P>
<P>
It remains Robinson's most controversial call to date, rivaled only by his fake 
field-goal decision against the 49ers this season. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to Dwayne Crutchfield? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The injured player the Rams would most want back for today's game is defensive 
end Doug Reed, who is out with an ankle sprain. His specialty is defending 
against the run. With Reed in the lineup last November, the Rams held the 
Giants to six net yards rushing. . . . The Giants have lost all four games in 
which they have rushed for fewer than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Butcher, the special teams player signed Thursday, reminds Ram coaches of 
a larger version of Tim Tyrrell, the former Ram bomb-squader who was lost to 
Plan B free agency last winter. The Rams bounced running back Gaston Green off 
the roster to make room for Butcher. His instructions? "Coach (John) Robinson 
told me, 'Don't get stupid penalties,' " Butcher said. "He told me to 
concentrate on my job and not just be a wild man." Butcher will wear uniform 
No. 59, Mark Jerue's old number. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson admitted that the Irv Pankey-Lawrence Taylor match-up is important but 
added: "How important? If Jackie Slater doesn't block the guy on the other side 
and he gets seven sacks, that's bad. It's no more important than Jackie vs. 
(Reggie) White last week." 
</P>
<P>
RAMS vs. GIANTS

EVERETT vs. SIMMS

ANNOUNCEMENT BREAKS GLOOM OF WINTER

<TEXT>
<P>
For sports fans, especially those without cable, Baltimore is not the most 
exciting place to spend the winter, even with the new skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
The hockey is minor league, the pro basketball is on loan, the college 
basketball is not much of a draw and the Major Indoor Soccer League really 
isn't that major. And whatever happened to the bowl game they were going to 
play at Memorial Stadium? The genius who thought that one up is probably the 
same person who designed the rock-and-roll assault on Noriega at the papal 
nunciature in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
But who says there ain't no cure for the wintertime blues? If you're the mayor 
of Baltimore, what you do is slip on your best Oriole suspenders, head off to a 
news conference and hope you get a little air time on the local stations. It 
worked for Kurt Schmoke. He, like the rest of us, was rescued by the Orioles, 
who spend their winter thinking of ways to make us think of summer. They've got 
their own cruise. They've got a Florida dream week. And they dream up those 
many announcements they space through the dark days of, as they like to call 
it, pre-spring training. 
</P>
<P>
The latest announcement, as you may have heard, was fairly dramatic. It doesn't 
just make you think of summer, but many summers hence. It's the kind of 
announcement that would have you mark a giant red circle on your calendar if 
you could only find one for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The All-Star Game is coming to Baltimore. At a news conference Thursday, 
Schmoke said he was excited. Oriole President Larry Lucchino said he was 
excited, too. And, not to be outdone, Herb Belgrad, who heads the stadium 
authority, said he was as excited as anyone else. 
</P>

And, heck, I guess we all are, especially because the baseball All-Star Game is 
by far the most enjoyable of its kind. Or did you miss the Bo Jackson show last 
year? 
</P>
<P>
What you don't want to do is spend much time thinking about how far away 1993 
is, or, for that matter, just how far away the summer of '90 remains. No, 
you're just supposed to think about baseball and how much you miss it. The idea 
is to get you in the mood. 
</P>
<P>
This is part and parcel of the Orioles' high-concept marketing technique. We 
know how hot the Orioles were last season, when they became the pre-earthquake 
story of the baseball world. What Lucchino is trying to do this winter is keep 
them hot, in the manner of a roaring fire. 
</P>
<P>
There is next season, of course, to sell. But there is also the new stadium, 
the plans for which were reviewed last fall in the New York Times, which 
basically said it was the greatest structure since the Hanging Gardens of 
Babylon. If the Orioles were to play in the new stadium next season, they'd be 
a cinch to draw 3 million. If the team has success anything like last year's, 
they may do it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Belgrad said Thursday that the stadium, which is scheduled to open in time for 
the 1992 season, was "ahead of schedule" and "under budget." These are strange 
and unlikely phrases to be heard in connection with building stadiums, but, of 
course, they haven't broken ground yet, and there was already that original 
price overrun. Whatever the eventual price, once the stadium is built, it will 
be a tourist attraction in its own right, complementing the nearby Inner 
Harbor. You can bet on that. Pete Rose already did. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a pretty sure bet that the competition for season tickets at the new 
stadium will be extreme, and, adding to that pressure, of course, will be the 
All-Star Game, tickets for which will almost certainly be tied to season-ticket 
holdings. That July evening in 1993 is one that a lot of people, for a lot of 
years, will be pointing to. These are good times to be young and in Orioles 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles worked hard to acquire the All-Star Game, which hasn't been played 
in Baltimore since 1958. One reason for the long gap is that the Orioles hadn't 
worked very hard to return the game to Baltimore. But, with a new management, 
and the new stadium, and the still-renewed city, the timing was perfect. 
According to Schmoke, the game is a $20 million bonanza for the city. It's 
worth much more than that in public relations and in the continuing effort to 
promote Baltimore as a destination city. 
</P>
<P>
Schmoke said he hoped the good folks at the National Football League would be 
paying attention to what is being planned as a weeklong celebration. Let's hope 
that the NFL isn't waiting until 1993 to make these kinds of decisions. If the 
NFL would only do the right thing and return a franchise to Baltimore, then 
these winters wouldn't seem nearly so long.

Perhaps they should call him Rodney. He must wonder what a fellow has to do to 
get a kind word. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite in 1989 had the kind of year a golfer only dreams about: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He won more money -- $1,395,278 -- than any player in the history of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He became the all-time leading money winner -- $5,600,691 earned with a 
golf stick. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He won his 11th, 12th and 13th tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was third in scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He finished second for the 17th time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was in the top 10 finishers 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He won his Ryder Cup match 8 and 7, which is the golf equivalent of a 2-hit 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He was player of the year, man of the hour. Chipper and putter of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
He did all this wearing owl-sized eyeglasses and sporting a physique that, at 5 
feet 8 and 155 pounds, is considerably short of linebacker stature. 
</P>
<P>
So they give him a ticker-tape parade, keys to the city, a reception at the 
White House, audience with the Pope and scheduled a movie about his life 
starring Robert Redford or Sly Stallone, right? 
</P>
<P>
Wrong. Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
They looked up at Tom Kite in the press room down here at the 38th Annual MONY 
Tournament of Champions and they said, "Uh, er, ah, Tom, about the U.S. Open at 
Rochester last year. Want to tell us about it?" 
</P>
<P>
Kite winced. 
</P>
<P>
It reminded idiotically of the story of the mother whose son was drowning and 
she was screaming for help. When someone dived into the riptide to rescue him 
and bring him back, the lady glared. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a hat!" she snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite lost the hat at Rochester. With only 14 holes left to play in the U.S. 
Open there, he had a three-stroke lead, was playing his usual consistent, 
unruffled, down-the-middle game when, all of a sudden, the ball began coming 
off the club head sideways. 
</P>
<P>
It looked like the worst case of Open nerves since Sam Snead in 1939. It was 
like watching a baby carriage roll downhill into the water. It hurt to look. 
The wheels began to fly off his game. Kite paled and got the look on his face 
of a guy who has just seen the eyes move in the castle wall portrait. 
</P>
<P>
He stumbled to a 78. He joined that forlorn company of players who blew the 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he is in some pretty good company. Besides Snead in '39, there were 
Ben Hogan in '55, Arnold Palmer in '66, Jack Nicklaus in '71. 
</P>
<P>
Only rarely does somebody win an Open. It's a tournament someone loses. It 
serves up victims, not victors. 
</P>
<P>
And '89 was Tom Kite's turn in the barrel. It will color his life. 
</P>
<P>
You have to be a pretty good player to blow the Open. Sam Snead won more 
tournaments than anybody who ever played the game but the Open wasn't one of 
them. And that's the first thing anybody ever remembers about Sam Snead. It'll 
be on his headstone. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Kite knows the feeling. As he took his seat before the lord high 
inquisitors of the press down here, the knights of the keyboard went right past 
his accomplishments in '89 and went unerringly to the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
Had '89 on balance been a disappointment for him? 
</P>
<P>
Tom looked incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, fellows, I just had the most incredibly successful year of my career, one 
of the most successful anyone ever had. I hit a lot of good shots." 
</P>
<P>
The press was courteous. But relentless. What about the not-so-good shot -- the 
one that went soaring into the water on No. 5 at Oak Hill? 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the shot that cost Tom Kite the Open at Oak Hill would have been 
better if it had been worse. A short time later, his playing partner, Scott 
Simpson, hit a worse right-to-right shot. But his was so bad it came to rest 
out in the open. He had a shot to the green. Kite's shot was just bad enough to 
have double-bogey written all over it. 
</P>
<P>
It reinforces the well-known adage that golf, like life, is not fair. 
</P>
<P>
But the point to remember is that Tom Kite did not don a false mustache and 
dark glasses and sneak out of town to drown his disappointment, sob his heart 
out, smash his clubs, blame the government or look for someone else to blame. 
He didn't even duck the press. He went manfully into the interview room that 
night and faced the music like the captain of the Titanic describing the 
iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, he was back on a tee. He played creditably in the Western 
Open, where he won $18,667 and finished 11th. Like a World War I pilot, he went 
right back up to a dogfight. 
</P>
<P>
It is the mark of a champion that he can shrug off disappointment and carry the 
fight to his opponent. Hogan had a 12 on a hole in a Jacksonville Open once. 
And made a two on the next hole. 
</P>
<P>
Pitchers who serve up gopher balls have been known to strike out the next 
batter. Fighters get off the floor to win. 
</P>
<P>
If you play golf for a living, you do well to treat disaster as an imposter, 
not a permanent part of the family. There are times when even the greatest 
players cannot break 80. 
</P>
<P>
The trick would be to save your cataclysms for the Bank of Boston Classic or 
the K mart Greater Greensboro Open when the whole world isn't looking. Don't 
hit the ball in the water in the Masters, as Seve Ballesteros does, or in the 
Open, as Tom Kite did. 
</P>
<P>
Golfers relate to the Tom Kite and Ballesteros and Snead, empathize with their 
shipwreck shots. They know all too well what can happen when ball meets hosel 
instead of club face. 
</P>
<P>
It's reassuring to know it can happen to a guy who is playing the best golf out 
there these days. 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Kite, who last year hit some of the best shots anybody has ever hit, 
must still answer for the one shot that didn't come off. One journalist cut 
right through the tournaments won, the money won, the trophy standings and 
said, accusingly, "Do you feel the Open owes you one?" 
</P>
<P>
Kite sighed. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf doesn't owe you a thing," he said. "It's a cruel game. Look at this. The 
best year of my life is also, in a way, the most disappointing. I get asked 
about the one that got away, not the ones hanging on my wall." 
</P>
<P>
That tells you all you need to know about golf. As someone said, it's not a 
game, it's a sentence. You don't win it, you survive it. Every tournament is 
like getting on the Hindenburg.

MAGIC BEMOANS MAKING SHOT AS LAKERS LOSE 
</P>

<P>
As intense a game as can be produced during the NBA regular season ended here 
Saturday night in unusual, yet somehow fitting, fashion. 
</P>
<P>
In the final frantic seconds of the Golden State Warriors' 133-131 victory over 
the Lakers, Warrior rookie Tim Hardaway was given the thumbs-up sign from Coach 
Don Nelson for fouling Magic Johnson. Johnson, in turn, was upset for making 
the second of two free throws with 3.2 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Such was the peculiar nature of the Warriors' victory, which ended the Lakers' 
winning streak at four games and extended Golden State's home-court winning 
streak to seven games. 
</P>
<P>
The craziness began with the Lakers trailing, 132-129, and trying for a 
three-point shot with 7.8 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson found himself with the ball at the top of the three-point circle, but 
Hardaway fouled him hard, making Johnson's attempt fall well short with 3.2 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
It was a smart play, since the Lakers could not tie the score with two free 
throws. Nelson vigorously motioned his approval. Johnson calmly sank the first 
shot. On the second shot, however, he intentionally shot it short and then 
darted from the free throw line to retrieve the ball off the front rim. 
</P>
<P>
The only problem was that the ball bounced off the rim and fell through the 
basket. Warriors 132, Lakers 131. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me how quickly (Johnson) shot it," the Lakers' A.C. Green said. 
"Nobody was really prepared for it . . . but I saw out of the corner of my eye 
the ball in mid-flight. Earvin was right behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson, still shaking his head about making the second free throw, said: 
"I couldn't believe it. A.C. would've had the rebound. If that (free throw) 
comes off the rim, it's a tie game, because both those guys (Warrior players) 
were looking down. Both A.C. and I had position. But the (ball) just crawled 
in. You get upset because, I mean, how many times do you make a free throw when 
you want to miss?" 
</P>
<P>
When play finally resumed, the Lakers immediately fouled Rod Higgins. The clock 
showed 2.5 seconds to play, but the referees eventually reset it to 2.9 seconds 
after Laker complaints. The Lakers, it turned out, probably could have used 
another tenth of a second or so. Higgins made the first shot for a two-point 
lead, but missed the second shot. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who had 27 points and 18 rebounds, grabbed the ball and dribbled, 
launching a shot from three-quarters court before the buzzer sounded. The ball 
was on line, but five feet short. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers (22-7) saw their Pacific Division lead reduced to 1 1/2 games over 
Portland. The Lakers also are barely ahead of San Antonio (21-7) for the best 
record in the Western Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers repeatedly took leads, only to see the Warriors (13-17) hack at them 
and eventually go ahead for good early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The final 44 seconds, which took about 10 minutes to play, simply came down to 
the Warriors executing better than the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 128-126, the Lakers had the ball out of bounds under their own 
basket. A long inbounds pass to James Worthy at the top of the three-point 
circle -- he was the only open Laker -- was intercepted by Chris Mullin, who 
raced the open court before being fouled. He made both free throws, giving the 
Warriors a four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers did not yield. Byron Scott, who missed his first seven shots 
Saturday, sank a three-point shot with 30.7 remaining to cut Golden State's 
lead to 130-129. 
</P>
<P>
Then it was the Lakers' turn to become defensive. Hardaway's jump shot with 11 
seconds left missed badly, but the long rebound flew over Green's head and into 
the hands of Terry Teagle. Teagle, who led all scorers with 35 points, made 
both free throws with 7.8 seconds left for a 132-129 Warrior lead. 
</P>
<P>
After the teams swapped timeouts, the Lakers set up for a three-point shot. 
Cooper had made four three-point baskets, Scott two and Worthy one. 
</P>
<P>
But the Warriors, as per Nelson's instructions, did not allow the Lakers to 
attempt an unmolested three-point attempt. Once that option was gone, the 
Lakers were left forced to go inside. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to play a great game to beat the Lakers, and we played a great game," 
Nelson said. "If we are going to beat anyone, everyone (on the Warriors) has to 
play a good game. But if we're going to beat the Lakers, we have to have 
everyone play a great game." 
</P>
<P>
Teagle made 14 of 22 shots, Mullin had 26 points and 12 rebounds and Lithuanian 
star Sharunas Marciulionis scored 16 of his 18 points in the second half. As a 
team, the Warriors made 33 of 35 free throw attempts and shot 49.5% from the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were led by Worthy's 30 points. Green's 11 offensive rebounds were a 
career high. Johnson had 14 points and 16 assists and one more free throw than 
he cared to have. 
</P>
<P>
"I find no fault with the way our guys played tonight," Laker Coach Pat Riley 
said. "Neither team could stop the other. A couple of possessions just made the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Riley could find some fault. Asked about Johnson's free throw, Riley 
said: "We couldn't even do anything right there." 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Magic Johnson declined to comment on his proposed pay-per-view, one-on-one game 
against Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls on June 25, which is still being 
negotiated. "When it's all final, I'll talk," Johnson said. . . . The wife of 
Manute Bol, the Golden State Warriors' 7-foot-7 center, recently gave birth to 
a son, Madot. But, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, Madot, at 19 1/2 
inches, is the shortest among three recent children born to Warrior personnel. 
The newborn daughter of Warrior guard Winston Garland was 21 inches, and 
assistant coach Garry St. Jean's son, born on New Year's Eve, measured 20 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
Warrior Coach Don Nelson, who said last week he would take a year's sabbatical 
to coach the U.S. Olympic basketball team in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, has 
softened his stance. Nelson said he still wants to coach the Olympic team, but 
said he would hope not to be forced to miss any time coaching the Warriors. . . 
. The Lakers and Warriors will not play again until March 9 at the Forum.

KINGS HIT A LOW POINT IN TORONTO, 7-4; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: LOS ANGELES BATTLES BACK TO GET EVEN IN THIRD PERIOD, BUT THE MAPLE 
LEAFS PULL AWAY FOR VICTORY.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goalie Kelly Hrudey of the Kings sat in the locker room with a blank look after 
a 7-4 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The game had been over for 15 minutes, but Hrudey, alone in his thoughts, 
replayed the evening. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied in the third period, 4-4, the Kings allowed three 
consecutive goals, including an empty-netter, en route to their third 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
"Listen, we got to stick together," Hrudey said. "I'm not going to go out there 
and start criticizing my teammates. That's been one of our problems all season 
long. If we stick together we'll play through it." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have lost four of five games, their worst slump since a four-game 
losing streak in November. 
</P>
<P>
Are the Kings playing as poorly during this losing streak as they were earlier 
this season? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Hrudey said. "The two losses previous to tonight weren't that bad because 
we had a lot of chances. Tonight we were bad. 
</P>
<P>
"If you start to read into things and make more out of things rather than 
trying to gain some positives out of the last three losses, you tend to group 
all three losses into the bad category. And it just festers from there. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like wildfire, it spreads so quickly. And that negative attitude is an 
evil that's hard to get rid of. Believe me." 
</P>
<P>
After beating the Washington Capitals to open the four-game trip, the Kings 
lost the next three. 
</P>
<P>
Is this a good time to be going home, where the Kings open a five-game home 
stand Tuesday against St. Louis? 
</P>
<P>
"That's an understatement," Hrudey said. 
</P>
<P>
Did the King collapse start in the third period? 
</P>
<P>
"It started before that," King Coach Tom Webster said. "It started way before 
that. In the first period we were just awful, just awful. We were lucky to come 
away tied, 2-2. The last two games I felt we worked hard. Even though we lost I 
wasn't that upset. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we did not work. Let's put it this way, some of us didn't work, and 
when you're an offensive hockey team you'd better score because that means you 
have to work at the other part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
Does Webster think the Kings need to trade for better defensemen? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not that concerned about our defense," Webster said. "I'm concerned with 
our work without the puck. There's a price that has to be paid. . . . You can 
make excuses all you want, but defensive hockey is hard work. I don't want to 
say much more because I'll get myself in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Although the marquee outside aging Maple Leaf Gardens read: Kings vs. Leafs, 8 
p.m., it should have read: Wayne Gretzky vs. Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
When Gretzky plays in Toronto it's an event. Scalpers were getting $300 for 
choice seats. The worst seats in the Gardens were going for $40. And business 
was so brisk that one scalper told fans to line up. 
</P>
<P>
Born in nearby Brantford, Ontario, Gretzky is a local legend. And the Great One 
didn't disappoint the sellout crowd of 16,328, scoring one goal and assisting 
on another as the Kings rebounded from a 4-2 second-period deficit to tie it, 
4-4. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky set up right wing Mikko Makela for the tying goal at 1:31 of the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
But Toronto right wing Daniel Marois, who had a first-period goal, scored 
back-to-back goals for his first hat trick of the season. Left wing Vincent 
Damphousse assisted on all three of Marois' goals. 
</P>
<P>
"When you win against a team like L. A. and Wayne Gretzky, it's always a big 
lift for us," Damphousse said. "A lot of people thought we weren't going to win 
this game. But I think we felt we could beat anyone in the league." 
</P>
<P>
Marois got his second goal on a power play at 7:47 of the third period. 
Damphousse set up the play when he centered the puck to Marois, who was alone 
in the crease. Hrudey didn't have a chance. Marois added his third goal after a 
scramble in front of the net at 12:39. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto right wing Lou Franceschetti added an empty-net goal with 1:45 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we didn't do our jobs," King defenseman Tom Laidlaw said. "It was a 
real team effort tonight. It's real easy to point fingers at people, but it 
isn't going to do us any good. I know it sounds corny, but it takes everybody 
to win. And when we lose it's the same way. Tonight was the perfect example of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like we're in last place in our division. We're still a good hockey 
team." 
</P>
<P>
But they didn't look like a very good team against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
Toronto center Ed Olczyk extended his scoring streak to 17 games when he scored 
an unassisted goal in the second period. . . . Center Gilles Thibaudeau, who 
was called up by the Maple Leafs Friday, scored on his first shot of the game. 
It was his first goal as a Maple Leaf since he was acquired from the New York 
Islanders last month. Actor John Candy sat next to King owner Bruce McNall next 
to the Los Angeles bench. Mr. T. also took in the game.

Campanella, 68, a Hall of Famer who is a member of the club's community 
relations services department, is listed in serious but stable condition. His 
condition was listed as serious Friday. 
</P>
<P>
He is still in the intensive care unit and is breathing with the assistance of 
a respiratory machine, but he is slowly being taken off the machine, the 
nursing supervisor said.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE'S SO GOOD, EVEN HIS INCOMPLETIONS LOOK PRETTY

"And, at quarterback, No. 16, JOE Mon-TAN-a!" said the public-address announcer 
-- the turning point in Saturday's NFC playoff game at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana threw four touchdown passes and had a fifth called back by a 
penalty on himself. Then he returned to play the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Well, sports fans, that was the ol' ballgame between the reigning Super Bowl 
champion San Francisco 49ers and the will-we-EVER-win-one Minnesota Vikings, 
who were put to sleep, 41-13, by a 49er team that keeps coming back for more, 
more, more. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never in the football game," said Viking Coach Jerry Burns. 
</P>
<P>
(Oh, sure you were, Jer. You were the ones in the white uniforms, remember?) 
</P>
<P>
"We got our bleep kicked," said Viking defensive tackle Henry Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
(He was so angry, he actually used the B word.) 
</P>
<P>
"Either they're better than last year or we're worse," said Viking offensive 
tackle Tim Irwin, "and I honestly don't think we're worse." 
</P>
<P>
(Let's put it to a vote.) 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the 49ers may be better than they were last year at every position 
but quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
They're about the same at quarterback, because Montana can't get much better. 
</P>
<P>
He's the sort of quarterback who throws pretty incompletions. He completed his 
first eight passes Saturday so easily, he made Minnesota's defensive backs look 
like cardboard cutouts at a police pistol-shooting range. You had to keep 
counting Vikings on the field to make sure there were 11. We've seen better 
defense played by the Stanford band. 
</P>
<P>
That's how bad Montana can make somebody look. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe played a stupendous game," said 49er Coach George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
(Hey, Joe played. The rest of the quote is redundant.) 
</P>
<P>
"He drops back. He sits there. He waits," Thomas said. "We just about get to 
him. He releases the ball. Next play he drops back. He waits. We chase him. He 
runs. We just about get him. He releases the ball. Over and over again. He's 
always just releasing the ball. The guy's got timing, man. Timing." 
</P>
<P>
(You bet your B, Henry.) 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget, this was the NFL's No. 1-rated defense that was chasing Montana. 
And all he had in front of him was an offensive line that, well, let's just say 
it was rated lower than No. 1. In fact: "It's been insinuated that we're the 
worst offensive line in the league," 49er guard Bruce Collie pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
How'd this line look against the Vikings? 
</P>
<P>
"I think zero sacks speaks for itself," Collie said. 
</P>
<P>
Woof. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, having Joe Montana behind the line makes any line better, even 
against mean old Minnesota dudes such as Keith Millard and Ray Berry and Joey 
Browner and Al Noga. 
</P>
<P>
Montana said: "All week long, we've been hearing about their pass rush against 
our offensive line. That was the key. So, the credit goes to those guys (the 
49er line). When you get the time I had, and with the guys I have to throw to, 
good things are going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana is a good thing who is going to happen. He is going to happen again 
next Sunday, matter of fact. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota, meanwhile, tried quarterback after quarterback after quarterback. 
Wade Wilson, then Tommy Kramer, then some person from Delaware named Rich 
Gannon. By the time they got snuffed at Candlestick, the Vikings had called the 
number of every quarterback in their book, and might have given Fran Tarkenton 
a jingle if he hadn't been off somewhere conducting some personal-improvement 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
Shows you what separates the men from the boys, the Super Bowlers from the 
gutter ballers. 
</P>
<P>
If Roger Craig hadn't fumbled at the Viking eight on the opening drive, and if 
Montana hadn't crossed the line of scrimmage on a second-period pass to Jerry 
Rice, it is just possible that Montana would have thrown six touchdown passes 
in the first half, instead of only four. 
</P>
<P>
He's just the guy who could do it, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess anything Joe Montana does shouldn't come as a surprise," said Brent 
Jones, his tight end. 
</P>
<P>
(Good guess.) 
</P>
<P>
About the only surprise that did involve Montana was that he was still on the 
field until the score was 41-6. By then, the Viking coach looked around 101 
years old, the offensive coordinator was asking for volunteers at quarterback 
and the defensive coordinator was thinking about asking for sanctuary at the 
Vatican embassy. This was not a happy bunch of Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Montana was hot," Thomas said, "and Joe Montana was cool." 
</P>
<P>
(The guy gets you coming or going, doesn't he?)

ARCHER OPENS 7-SHOT LEAD WITH A 67; 
</P>
<P>
SENIOR GOLF: BUT HE SAYS HE WON'T BE SATISFIED UNLESS HE BEATS THE REGULAR TOUR 
PLAYERS, TOO.

George Archer isn't satisfied with running away with the senior division of the 
MONY Tournament of Champions. He wants to beat the "juniors," too. 
</P>
<P>
After shooting a five-under-par 67 Saturday over the 7,022-yard La Costa Hotel 
and Spa course, Archer, a rookie on the PGA Senior Tour, had a seven-shot lead 
in his division at seven-under-par 209 after 54 holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to play it safe and protect my lead," said Archer, playing in 
his sixth senior event after reaching the seniors tour eligibility age of 50 on 
Oct. 1. "I'm going out after birdies. I want to win the whole thing. They can 
keep the money. I just want the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
"The higher I finish with the kids, though, the better. It would mean 
something, because we're playing the same tees and cup placements." 
</P>
<P>
Archer trails the regular division leader, Paul Azinger, by six shots. After 54 
holes, only four others have better scores. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 Archer won 12 tournaments and almost $2 million on the regular 
tour. In his last regular tour event, he finished 14th in the Buick Open in 
late July. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm finally graduating after 25 years in high school," he said upon joining 
the senior tour. "Now I'll be starting college." 
</P>
<P>
Archer won the Gatlin Brothers Southwest tournament, joining Gary Player and 
Arnold Palmer as the only players to win their first senior event. He also tied 
for second at Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, he tied the course record for seniors. However, his effort is the 
best by a senior because he played from the back tees; the previous 
record-holders played from the front tees. Archer's only bogey came when he 
missed a 32-inch putt on the sixth hole. The only player who had a better third 
round was Mark O'Meara, with a 65. 
</P>
<P>
Among Archer's six birdies were putts of 25, 15 and 12 feet. He just missed two 
trap shots and three putts for birdies. 
</P>
<P>
Al Geiberger, who shot a one-under 71, is second among the seniors at 216. 
Bruce Crampton is at 218, with Chi Chi Rodriguez and Bobby Nichols another shot 
back. Defending champion Miller Barber trails Archer by 12 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Can anybody beat Archer? Rodriguez said: "Just go ahead and engrave the 
trophy." 
</P>
<P>
Orville Moody, who won the U.S. Senior Open last year and was selected golfer 
of the year by at least two publications, is at 228, 12 over par. 
</P>
<P>
But for Moody, simply being here is a triumph. Less than two weeks before the T 
of C, Moody was hunting in Texas. He had been in a blind for 2 1/2 hours when 
he felt a sharp pain in the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like being hit with a hammer," Moody said. "I didn't know when my 
friend would be around to check on me so I just used my hat for a pillow and 
laid down. In a few minutes my friend came and took me to the doctor. My blood 
pressure was 240 over 140. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister died of a brain hemorrhage at 53, and my father died of a stroke. I 
thought sure it was my time." 
</P>
<P>
Medical tests revealed no illness, however. "Apparently it was just stress," 
Moody said. "The headache is gone and I'm glad to be here." 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is that his daughter Michelle, who usually caddies for him and 
helps him read putts, is in Texas remodeling her condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Archer's daughter Elizabeth, who used to carry his bag on the 
regular tour, is his caddy again. She doesn't help him read putts, however. 
</P>
<P>
"Never ask a caddy to read putts or help do it," Archer said. "Before the 1969 
Masters, this caddy was telling me all about reading the greens at Augusta. I 
told him if he didn't shut up he was fired. He never said another word until I 
won it on Sunday. Then, he said, 'We sure did it, didn't we?' We sure did."

NCAA'S PROP. 42 MAY BE SET FOR OVERHAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON KROICHICK, MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
The impact of John Thompson's one-man strike will come into clearer focus 
starting Sunday, when the NCAA Convention opens in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson walked out of the Capital Centre last season just before tip-off of a 
Georgetown-Boston College game. He was protesting the NCAA's passage of 
controversial Proposition 42. 
</P>
<P>
That measure would prevent freshmen who do not meet minimum academic standards 
from receiving scholarship aid. The standards -- a 2.0 high school grade-point 
average and a score of 700 or better on the Scholastic Aptitude Test -- were 
adopted under Proposition 48. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Big East Conference is sponsoring legislation to rescind Proposition 
42, largely on Thompson's argument that it is racially discriminatory. A 
committee of university presidents also wants to change Proposition 42, 
allowing such freshmen to receive financial aid based only on need. 
</P>
<P>
Confused yet? By this time next week, the saga should make more sense. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the presidents' proposal will be passed," Pac-10 Conference 
Commissioner Tom Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
That proposal seems logical: "partial qualifiers" would still lose a year of 
eligibility, but those in need would not be financially abandoned. That would 
be unfair, given the $1 billion television contract the NCAA recently signed 
with CBS. 
</P>
<P>
By next year, the future of freshmen will come under closer scrutiny. The NCAA 
is studying the possibility of making all freshmen ineligible, a policy 
abandoned in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"You won't see it this year," Hansen said. "But there's continuing concern 
about putting 18-year-olds out there, with Dick Vitale screaming and millions 
of people watching." 
</P>
<P>
Back on the court, Louisiana State guard Chris Jackson adds admirers by the 
day. He took a mild slump with him to Houston on Tuesday night, when LSU beat 
Texas, 124-113. 
</P>
<P>
Former NBA standout Calvin Murphy attended the Tigers' shoot-around earlier in 
the day. He noticed that Jackson wasn't extending properly on his jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
Problem corrected. Jackson scored 28 points -- in the first half. Texas then 
went to a stifling box-and-one defense, keeping Jackson scoreless for the first 
10:05 of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Big deal. Jackson scored 23 in the final 9:55 to finish with 51. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris is better than I ever was," Murphy said. "He's a complete player. He had 
51, and it was an easy 51. It was nothing spectacular. He got 51 tonight, and 
tomorrow he could go out and get 50 assists." 
</P>
<P>
A random observation: the class of '92, widely heralded as the best ever, has 
justified its advance billing. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest names -- Jackson, Syracuse forward Billy Owens and Georgetown 
center Alonzo Mourning -- deserve first-team All-America consideration. But the 
class' real strength lies with an abundance of less visible, very good players. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's Christian Laettner, Notre Dame's LaPhonso Ellis, UCLA's Don MacLean and 
Stanford's Adam Keefe anchor a strong group of low-post players. Outside 
flashes such as Missouri's Anthony Peeler and the Arkansas tandem of Todd Day 
and Lee Mayberry complete an impressive package. 
</P>
<P>
This season's freshman class (of '93) appears guard-heavy. Georgia Tech's Kenny 
Anderson already is a star, and classmates Bobby Hurley (Duke), Terry Dehere 
(Seton Hall) and Calbert Cheaney (Indiana) have made a similarly smooth 
transition to the college game. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's strong freshmen -- even without the departed Lawrence Funderburke -- 
have carried the Hoosiers to an impressive 10-0 start entering the Big Ten 
season. 
</P>
<P>
In the hoop-rich Hoosier State, though, rivalry can distort perspective. Asked 
recently to evaluate the Big Ten race, Purdue Coach Gene Keady conveniently 
omitted Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
"As I thought at the beginning of the season, there are three teams in our 
league that can win the national title -- Michigan, Illinois and Minnesota," 
Keady said. "Those are the teams everybody's looking for to win the Big Ten." 
</P>
<P>
USC Coach George Raveling has denied rumors that he's talking to Miami Athletic 
Director Sam Jankovich about taking over the Hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Coach Bill Foster is retiring at season's end, and Raveling remains on 
shaky ground at USC. His contract runs through next season, when he expects a 
strong recruiting class to infuse life into the perpetually bad Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're a year away," Raveling said. "Then if we can't do it, it ain't 
nobody's fault but Raveling's." 
</P>
<P>
Jankovich was the athletic director when Raveling coached at Washington State 
(1972-83). Former Kentucky coach Eddie Sutton also has been mentioned as a 
possible successor to Foster. 
</P>
<P>
We leave you with this weird tale from Santa Clara: 
</P>
<P>
Ron Reis, the Broncos' 7-foot-1, 285-pound center, recently was introduced to 
professional wrestler Big John Studd (6-9, 350). Reis emerged toying with the 
thought of giving wrestling a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Reis, Ron's mother, offered only one piece of advice. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom said I should wrestle with a mask on, so I don't embarrass the family," 
Reis said.

James Dailey scored 17 points and St. Mary's made 10 three-point field goals 
Saturday night in a 73-68 victory over San Francisco in a West Coast Conference 
opener at Moraga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Also leading St. Mary's (4-9) were guards Mike Vontoure and John Levitt and

ALBACORE CATCH CLAIMED IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An angler on an overnight sportfishing boat out of San Diego Saturday claimed 
the first albacore catch of the the year, an occurrence that usually happens in 
the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
An unidentified angler on the sportfisher Prowler landed a 12-pound albacore at 
11 a.m., 72 miles south of San Diego on a course to Guadalupe Island. 
</P>
<P>
The Prowler was following a tip from a private boat that reported catching 
albacore in the same area a week earlier. Commercial net boats reportedly have 
been taking numerous albacore out of San Diego and near Santa Rosa Island in 
the Channel Islands west of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Albacore -- a popular fish also known as longfin tuna -- are the only tuna that 
can be labeled "white-meat tuna" for commercial canning purposes. They prefer 
warmer waters, and the peak season along the West Coast is usually during their 
spawning run from July through October. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Mahon of Fishermen's Landing in San Diego said Saturday's catch is not 
necessarily indicative of an early run but more likely could be attributed to 
unusual and temporary conditions.

ARIZONA GETS HELP FROM ROOKS AND ROUTS WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sean Rooks, a 6-11 sophomore, got Arizona off on the right track, scoring the 
19th-ranked Wildcats' first seven points to help send them on to an 81-61 
victory over Washington State Saturday in a Pacific 10 game at Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (8-2, 3-2) took 15-3 lead and then built a 40-29 halftime advantage 
against the smaller Cougars (7-7, 1-3). 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats began the second half with a 15-2 run to put the game out of 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
Rooks finished with 18 points and three blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Sean really came through for us in the starting spot, but we still need more 
rebounds from him," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said. Rooks had only three 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona used the full-court press and a tough zone defense to force 19 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
Washington State Coach Kelvin Sampson said his team practiced against the press 
but couldn't emulate Arizona's height and pressure on inbounds passes. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona guard Harvey Mason said: "I think you'll see us press more from now on 
because we like to tire the other team out." 
</P>
<P>
Washington State shot only 35.9% to Arizona's 44.8%, and had 14 fewer rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Arizona's 40th in a row at home, the nation's current longest 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona St. 63, Washington 48 -- Matt Anderson scored 18 points, Alex Austin 
added 17 and the Sun Devils made 10 three-point shots at Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth consecutive victory for the Sun Devils (8-4, 2-2) and eighth 
win in the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (6-6, 1-3) was held to its lowest point total this season.

The Boston Celtics, missing Larry Bird and Coach Jimmy Rodgers, got 29 points 
and 13 rebounds from Robert Parish and beat the Washington Bullets, 102-88, 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
The Celtics lost their best player, their coach and the game against the 
Clippers on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Bird suffered a sprained left ankle, described by the team as "moderate to 
severe," in the first quarter of the game in Boston, and Rodgers was suspended 
for one game and fined $1,000 by the league after bumping referee Joe Forte. 
Neither accompanied the team to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Lewis, who started in place of Bird, had 21 points for the Celtics, who 
snapped a five-game losing streak at Capital Centre dating back to Dec. 15, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston offense revolved around Parish, who repeatedly was able to establish 
position in the low post. Parish was 12 for 15 from the field despite frequent 
double-teaming by the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
Washington, which has lost seven of its last eight games, was led by Jeff 
Malone with 33 points, including 16 in the third quarter, and Bernard King with 
17. 
</P>
<P>
Boston has won five of its last six games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Chris Ford handled the team Saturday night, but Rodgers is 
expected to be back on the bench when the Celtics play at New Jersey Tuesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Vice President Rod Thorn said Rodgers was suspended because he bumped a 
referee and did not leave the court quickly enough after being ejected.

<P>
Joe Dumars scored 29 points and Isiah Thomas added 20 as the Detroit Pistons 
defeated the New York Knicks, 117-106, Saturday night at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Pistons' fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, who scored 10 points in the fourth quarter, had five points during a 
15-5 run that put away the Knicks. Dumars also made 13 of 13 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing scored 29 points for the Knicks. He scored 20 points in the first 
half, but appeared to tire in the fourth quarter when he scored only three. 
</P>
<P>
The win lifted the Pistons to within percentage points of the Chicago Bulls for 
first place in the Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
"We got great support from a lot of people," Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said. 
"Any time you beat New York, you do a lot of things well offensively and 
defensively. We needed the win." 
</P>
<P>
The victory was Detroit's ninth in 10 games and gave the Pistons a 22-11 
record. That's the same record they had after 33 games last season, when they 
posted the best record in the league and won their first NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
The Knicks had won 10 of their last 11 and four consecutive on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"We got our tails kicked," Knick Coach Stu Jackson said. "They played well and 
we played well in spots. Down at the end, their defense was better than ours. 
They're a very physical team." 
</P>
<P>
Utah 123, Denver 120 -- Karl Malone capped a 48-point performance with a 
three-point play with eight seconds left in overtime to lead the Jazz at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Malone made a layup off John Stockton's 15th assist and was fouled by Eddie 
Hughes. Malone added the free throw, giving Utah a 123-120 lead, and Todd 
Lichti missed a desperation three-point shot for Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 120-115, Denver tied the score on two free throws by Lichti and a 
three-point basket by Hughes with 1:02 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Davis scored 36 points and Fat Lever added 19 for Denver. It was the 
Nuggets' second loss in 14 home games. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 118, Chicago 111 -- Jack Sikma scored 21 points and led a 
third-quarter surge to snap the Bucks' eight-game losing streak against Central 
Division rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks' victory was their first at home over the Bulls since February 1987. 
Alvin Robertson, Jeff Grayer and Ricky Pierce had 18 points apiece for the 
Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan led the Bulls with 35 points and Bill Cartwright added 18. 
Jordan twisted a knee with three minutes left in the first quarter. He iced it 
for four minutes, returned, and finished the first half with 13 points, 
although he was limping noticeably when he left the court at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Charlotte 117, Indiana 111 -- The Hornets, playing at home, beat a team with a 
winning record for the first time this season, leaving Pacers Coach Dick 
Versace to vent the frustration of four consecutive losses at referee Hank 
Armstrong at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Versace had to be restrained by one of his players, LaSalle Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
San Antonio 109, Minnesota 96 -- David Robinson, Terry Cummings and Willie 
Anderson scored 22 points each as the Spurs, leaders of the Midwest Division, 
matched last season's victory total. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs are 21-7 with 3 1/2 months left in the season after finishing a 
franchise-worst 21-61 last season. 
</P>
<P>
With the Spurs leading, 80-75, Robinson put the game away with nine consecutive 
points. He had 15 in the fourth quarter. The Timberwolves' Scott Roth led all 
scorers with 24 points and Tony Campbell added 20. 
</P>
<P>
The Spurs led, 56-40, at halftime as Caldwell Jones contributed eight points 
and three blocked shots. The second one gave Jones 1,500 career blocked shots. 
Jones, 39, is the oldest player in the NBA. He finished with 11 points in 25 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 124, Philadelphia 119 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 29 points and 15 rebounds 
and his three-point play with 22 seconds left in overtime sparked the Rockets 
at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Buck Johnson scored a career-high 28 points, Otis Thorpe had 22 and Sleepy 
Floyd added 19 and a career-high 19 assists for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta 105, New Jersey 96 -- Moses Malone led the Hawks with 26 points and 12 
rebounds, hitting 12 of 12 from the free-throw line, to hand the visiting Nets 
their fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
John Long, playing his first game for the Hawks after signing a 10-day 
contract, hit a layup to start the winning rally with 11:24 to play, and 
Alexander Volkov converted a three-point play to put the Hawks in front for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 123, Orlando 112 -- Rookie Chucky Brown scored a season-high 30 
points and Steve Kerr scored all of his career-high 19 in the fourth quarter at 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a second-round pick from North Carolina State, hit 12 of 17 shots to 
finish nearly 24 points over his average. 
</P>
<P>
Kerr topped his previous career high of 15 points by hitting five three-point 
baskets and four free throws in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando has lost 16 of 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 120, Phoenix 110 -- Xavier McDaniel scored 10 of his 29 points in the 
fourth quarter as the SuperSonics won at home. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle won for the second time in three games with guard Avery Johnson in the 
lineup. Johnson, replacing Nate McMillan, had 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 124, Sacramento 121 -- The visiting Trail Blazers, using Terry 
Porter's 25 points, spoiled Dick Motta's debut as the Kings' coach. 
</P>
<P>
Two three-point baskets by Vinny Del Negro in the final eight seconds weren't 
enough for the Kings to overtake the Trail Blazers. Wayman Tisdale scored 30 
points, and Danny Ainge and Kenny Smith each added 23 for the Kings.

RANGER FORCE BORE BRUNT OF PANAMA TOLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS JEHL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The heaviest concentration of U.S. Army casualties in the Panama invasion was 
suffered by an 850-man contingent of Army Rangers whose nighttime parachute 
assault on a military camp at Rio Hato left one in 18 American soldiers killed 
or wounded, according to officials and records made available to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The elite force, which jumped into the heavily defended camp from transport 
jets flying only 500 feet above the ground, lost most of its wounded in the 
jump itself, with more than two dozen soldiers incapacitated by broken legs, 
torn knee ligaments and other orthopedic injuries, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Other casualties, including four Army Rangers killed in the Rio Hato operation, 
were put out of action during at least two hours of heavy fighting that 
followed the 1 a.m. Task Force Red parachute drop Dec. 20 as Panamanian forces 
sought to defend their Pacific coast base. 
</P>
<P>
The new account of the operation, based on interviews and casualty records, 
contrasts with earlier, official descriptions of a smooth engagement in which a 
pair of bombs dropped nearby by a Stealth fighter stunned the enemy and 
permitted U.S. forces to capture the base with only light casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of parachute-related injuries alone was about triple the proportion 
normally expected in such operations and more than six times the casualty rate 
suffered by Rangers in their October, 1983, assault on Grenada, officials and 
military historians acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
They blamed the higher injury rate in the Rio Hato assault on the fact that the 
paratroopers, not accustomed to jumping at such a low altitude to begin with, 
also had to contend with darkness and equipment loads of more than 100 pounds 
as they sought to land on the rock-hard airstrip of the Panamanian camp. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Rio Hato assault won an essential victory over the fiercely loyal 
6th and 7th Infantry companies of the Panama Defense Forces, military spokesmen 
in the United States said they were not greatly troubled by the high 
concentration of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
They noted in particular that the alternative to the broken bones suffered in 
the low-level parachute drop might have been bullet wounds from hostile fire 
that began while paratroopers were still in the air. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. military officials in Panama disclosed that planning for the Rio Hato 
assault was far less extensive than it was for other long-rehearsed elements of 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Rio Hato preparations began only last October when Panamanian troops based 
at the camp played a major role in foiling a coup attempt against dictator 
Manuel A. Noriega. One military source said he believed that the hurried 
planning could account for the unusually large number of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
Details about last month's engagement remain closely guarded by the Army's 
Special Operations Command, which oversees the Rangers, and it could not be 
determined whether any of the deaths or injuries might have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
But the new information about the extent and nature of casualties at Rio Hato 
and in other engagements provides an indication that the glowing pronouncements 
by American officials about the fighting in Panama tended to minimize serious 
problems encountered by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon has refused to disclose the number of Americans killed and injured 
in each phase of the operation, and it has not yet released an official list of 
the U.S. soldiers wounded in action. 
</P>
<P>
But a preliminary Army casualty list obtained by The Times makes clear that the 
unit that suffered the heaviest casualties was the 632-man 2nd Ranger 
Battalion, which lost two killed and 37 wounded as it led the Rio Hato assault. 
</P>
<P>
The unit, based in Ft. Lewis, Wash., was joined in the assault by elements of 
the 3rd Ranger Battalion from Ft. Benning, Ga., which lost two killed and seven 
wounded at Rio Hato, according to documents and officials. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the dead and wounded totaled 48 from the 850-man Ranger contingent, 
established to play the principal role in the kind of rapid deployment 
operations seen as increasingly important in the new Army. 
</P>
<P>
The ratio of casualties in the Ranger unit was considerably less than that 
suffered by a small unit of Navy SEALs, which lost four dead and 11 wounded in 
a successful effort to capture the airfield housing Noriega's private jet, 
according to Navy officials. 
</P>
<P>
But the new details of casualties at Rio Hato clearly rank it as the bloodiest 
engagement for the Army, the service most extensively involved in the U.S. 
invasion. "The majority of Army casualties came at Rio Hato," said Maj. Don 
Gersh, a spokesman for the Special Operations Command at Ft. Bragg, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
No details about the extent of Panamanian casualties at Rio Hato have yet been 
released, but U.S. officers who led the assault told reporters in Panama that 
at least 250 enemy soldiers were captured. 
</P>
<P>
The assault on the camp, located about 75 miles west of Panama City, began at 
"H-hour" of 1 a.m. Dec. 20 when a single Stealth fighter dropped two one-ton 
bombs in a field adjoining the Rio Hato barracks. The diversionary tactic 
caused some Panamanian troops to run outside in panic, according to 
participants' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Col. William Kernan, who led the airborne Ranger assault that followed, told 
reporters a few days after the attack that paratroopers had encountered hostile 
fire while still in the air, but he said the opposition, while "fierce at 
first," had "quickly died down." He refused to reveal the extent of U.S. 
casualties, saying only that they had been light. 
</P>
<P>
More recent accounts, supported by the casualty records, place greater emphasis 
on the problems the Rangers encountered as they slammed down on the hard Rio 
Hato runway after a parachute descent that in most cases lasted only about 12 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was scary," Ranger Pfc. Anthony Silvery told the Tacoma (Wash.) News 
Tribune after being airlifted home with torn knee ligaments. "Bullets in the 
air. Bullets on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
For other Rangers, the injuries suffered in the jump were only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
According to separate accounts provided by two participants in the assault, one 
Ranger private suffered major injuries when he broke his leg in the jump and 
then was dragged nearly 100 yards down the runway when he could not disentangle 
his parachute. 
</P>
<P>
Although other soldiers eventually helped the private get rid of the chute, 
they mistakenly decided to mark the location of the wounded Ranger with a "glow 
stick." When they returned after fighting had diminished, they found that the 
light had attracted enemy shells that left the Ranger riddled with shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldier was undergoing surgery late last week at a military 
hospital in San Antonio, according to officials there. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, according to a spokesman for the unit, at least 24 of the 37 
non-fatal injuries suffered by members of the 2nd Ranger Battalion occurred 
during the parachute drop. A medical official said that "at least four" of the 
seven members of the 3rd Rangers wounded in action during the Rio Hato assault 
were injured as a result of the parachute jump. 
</P>
<P>
The 3% combined injury rate is three times the 1% rate expected on the basis of 
training jumps designed to simulate combat operations, paratroop experts said. 
</P>
<P>
The experts, however, stressed that paratroopers in training are permitted to 
jump from 800 feet without a full load of equipment and to land on soft ground, 
reducing the likelihood of injury. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the Rangers who assaulted Rio Hato were "humping some pretty good 
rucks" -- carrying minimum loads of about 100 pounds, one former Ranger said. 
</P>
<P>
And at the time of the assault, said Maj. Gersh, the special operations 
spokesman, "you're coming in low, you're coming in fast, and you're coming in 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
But the officials acknowledged that in a similar combat environment in Grenada, 
an estimated 400 Ranger paratroopers who landed on a hard runway lost just two 
paratroopers to injury -- a rate of only 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
At Torrijos International Airport, the other principal theater of operations 
for paratroopers in the Panama invasion, the jump injury rate was about 2%, 
according to Ranger and 82nd Airborne officials. 
</P>
<P>
They attributed the difference to the fact that many of the paratroopers at 
Torrijos landed off the runway in swamps or jungle, frustrating many of them 
but resulting in fewer injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The four Rangers killed in the Rio Hato assault were Staff Sgt. Larry R. 
Barnard of Hallstead, Pa.; Pfc. Roy Dennis Brown Jr. of Buena Park, Calif.; 
Specialist Phillip Scott Lear of Westminster, S.C., and Pfc. John Mark Price of 
Conover, Wis.

'LOS ANGELIZATION': IT'S THE CENTRAL COAST'S NIGHTMARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN LUIS OBISPO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the perfect solitude of the Santa Lucia Mountains beside an old family 
graveyard where deer and wild pigs are the only regular visitors, the 
great-grandson of a pioneer rancher talked about "Los Angelization" in a tone 
of voice normally reserved for drought or taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be the ruination of our way of life if something isn't done about it 
pretty soon," said Billy Warren, whose family acquired their 10,000-acre cattle 
ranch in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, Warren would blame mishaps on bobcats or coyotes. Now, when a 
calf is mauled, he is more inclined to suspect an irresponsible dog owner from 
Los Angeles. When a ranch gate is left open or one of his decorative cow skulls 
stolen, his suspicions run in a similar vein. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angelization. 
</P>
<P>
Reverberating like a chain saw up and down the Central Coast, the term means 
different things -- none of them good -- to the residents of a pastoral region 
that is close to being overwhelmed by the problems and opportunities created by 
a mass migration out of Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
Planners and real estate experts here estimate that more than half the people 
who have moved to San Luis Obispo County during the last five years have come 
from Los Angeles and Orange counties, many of them cash rich from home sales in 
a relatively booming Southern California real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while a lot of people along the Central Coast would like to blame the 
turmoil here on the interlopers from the south, there is the feeling as well 
that traditional values somehow have gone topsy-turvy. 
</P>
<P>
Ranchers and farmers, tempted by skyrocketing land values, can seem only too 
willing to turn their great-grandfathers' ranches into condo clusters, business 
parks and destination resorts. At the same time, lawyers and college professors 
-- people who have seldom waked to the crow of a rooster, let alone chased a 
stray cow -- are becoming instant experts on the preservation of ranchland. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening here is part of the growing pains being felt by a number of 
places in the West, from Seattle to Santa Fe, N.M. Surging populations, fed by 
emigres from Southern California, are causing new problems from higher home 
prices to increased traffic congestion to political disharmony. 
</P>
<P>
In San Luis Obispo County, the most visible sign of change is along the 
southern shore, from Arroyo Grande to Pismo Beach, where a phalanx of salmon 
pink tile roofs is filling in one of the last uncluttered stretches of 
coastline between Laguna Nigel and Big Sur. Seemingly overnight, the low-key 
county tucked between Santa Barbara and Big Sur, a region noted for its clean 
air, country towns and mantle of green mountains, is starting to remind people 
of a Southern California suburb. 
</P>
<P>
"We're already beginning to look like Orange County," grumbled one local 
official. 
</P>
<P>
During the last year, real estate prices rose from 50% to 150% across the 
county. "You have to look pretty hard to find an entry-level house for less 
than $235,000," said Michael Dwiggins, the president of the San Luis Obispo 
City Board of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Applications for building permits shot up 300%. Water rates have tripled in 
some towns, and at least one municipal well has dried up. Traces of 
cancer-causing pollutants have begun showing up in ground water near landfills. 
And, this year, for the first time, county air quality fell below state 
standards for ozone and other components of automobile exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Rural Gentry 
</P>
<P>
The sparsely populated county -- 150,000 in 1980 -- is expected to double its 
inhabitants by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Observing the changes, Stephen Nukes, the president of a planning firm that 
works for several coastal counties, predicted the rise of a new rural gentry 
that will alter the way life is led along the Central Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"San Luis Obispo could easily become the Beverly Hills of the Central Coast," 
Nukes said. "In the past, most of the people who moved here were from the San 
Joaquin Valley, moving from one agricultural region to another. But what we're 
seeing now is a huge influx of city people with money and sophistication. Many 
of them are active retirees, in their 40s and 50s, who don't have to work 
everyday and have the time to devote to local culture or politics." 
</P>
<P>
Nukes speculated that along with the new breed will come fancier stores, 
restaurants and the novelty of night life. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of all the activity, the county's leadership has succumbed to 
political paralysis. For months, the San Luis Obispo County Board of 
Supervisors has been unable to agree on a strategy for coping with the 
pressures of the population explosion. As a result, the debate over growth 
policy will probably be decided at the ballot box next June. Already, rival 
initiatives are pitting north county residents against south, splitting 
ranchers into warring camps and, in a few cases, setting family members against 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
"The last year and a half has been a fright," said Bryce Tingle, the county's 
assistant planning director. 
</P>
<P>
If people can agree on one thing, however, it is that Los Angeles (and Orange 
County) are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
"LA, GO HOME," read a picket sign outside a recent meeting of the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomers from the south are not resented just for coming but for coming 
with a certain attitude, one that is especially rankling to the people here who 
would like to profit from the new growth. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who just got here, the L.A. refugees, are the ones trying to close 
the door behind them," Supervisor Bill Coy said. "It's the ex-city dwellers who 
come with these schemes to preserve open space by preventing farmers from 
selling off grazing land that can't support cows any longer," said Coy, who 
grows oranges and avocados on his north county farm. 
</P>
<P>
This struggle over the land, of course, is not altogether new to California. It 
has happened as well in Northern California's Gold Country and Wine Country and 
in the Sierra foothills near Yosemite -- picturesque locales where city 
dwellers have fled in search of all the comforts of Santa Monica amid the 
untrammeled splendor of nature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scenic Ranchland 
</P>
<P>
At issue in San Luis Obispo County is the fate of a million or more acres of 
scenic ranchland. For 200 years, the misty pastures and furrowed slopes have 
drawn people to the landscape, from the Spanish missionary Junipero Serra, who 
established a mission in 1772, to the American soldier-explorer John C. 
Fremont, who claimed the county for the United States in 1847, to today's 
expatriates from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Among the latest wave are people willing to wait five years or more for a 
building permit that will let them erect a house with a view of the Pacific or 
of the Morro peaks, the nine miniature mountains that march single file from 
the city of San Luis Obispo into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
The fight over the future of the land tends to pit agrarian interests, which 
want to profit from the real estate value of grazing land, against a coalition 
of newcomers and long-time residents, most of them townsfolk. They want to keep 
the land free of shopping centers, golf courses and subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
Public opinion polls show a large majority of residents favor putting the 
brakes on the building boom, and both sides in the current political battle 
insist they are fighting for the same thing -- maintaining the county's rural 
character. 
</P>
<P>
The agrarians, led by the San Luis Obispo County Farm Bureau, argue that if 
they are allowed to develop their least-productive acreage, it will give them 
the financial cushion they need to keep the bulk of their land in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be the generation that sold the farms," said Marilyn Britton, 
executive manager of the Farm Bureau. "The reason there is so much open space 
in the county is because farmers and ranchers work hard and go into debt to 
keep their land in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
"The preservationists have no idea of the costs involved in agriculture. A lot 
of them don't even like farming," she said, contending that they are among the 
first to complain about farm noises and smells, not to mention pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
The Farm Bureau and its allies are battling an initiative that would limit 
population growth by 2.5% annually and slow rural development by making it much 
harder to sell off land currently zoned agricultural. The Farm Bureau alliance 
is sponsoring a counter-initiative that would restrict growth to 3% a year and 
provide unspecified incentives for the protection of "economically viable 
agricultural land and the preservation of open space." At the same time, the 
counter-initiative would give farmers and ranchers a free hand to dispose of 
agricultural acreage. 
</P>
<P>
However, much of the most beautiful land -- along mountainsides, for example -- 
is the least agriculturally viable and the likeliest candidate for development. 
According to the Farm Bureau, only 11% of the county's agricultural land is 
considered "prime" or capable of supporting row crops and vineyards, where most 
of the money in farming is made these days. 
</P>
<P>
A number of ranchers agreed to keep their land in agriculture for 10 years in 
return for tax breaks under the state's land conservation or Williamson Act. 
But as the 10-year pacts expire, some ranchers are deciding to not to renew, so 
that their land will be available for development. 
</P>
<P>
Many thousands of acres of pastureland have already passed into the hands of 
developers, and there has been a flurry of plans presented that, if approved by 
county officials, would break down 5,000- and 10,000-acre ranches into five- 
and 10-acre ranchettes. 
</P>
<P>
The most ambitious plan to date would take the 14,000-acre Santa Margarita 
Ranch into a suburban community, complete with 3,000 homes, two or three golf 
courses and an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
"The planned community would overwhelm the little town of Santa Margarita (a 
settlement of 2,000 people and one of the oldest in the county) and wipe out 
one of the last big viable cattle ranches," said Tingle, the assistant county 
planning director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth Controls 
</P>
<P>
Not all ranchers and farmers side with the Farm Bureau. Some, like Billy Warren 
of Cambria, support efforts to restrict the sale and development of 
agricultural land. Without growth controls, Warren said the cost of growth -- 
of Los Angelization -- will fall on ranchers who can ill afford higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"What we'd like is to let people from L.A. come up and buy a house or a ranch 
without causing us to go broke paying for the water and the sewers and the 
schools they expected to have waiting for them," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
Warren's neighbor, Shirley Bianchi, also the descendant of a pioneer rancher, 
is campaigning for county supervisor on a platform that would allow ranchers to 
sell development rights without letting go of their land. The rights could be 
bought by someone wishing to develop property elsewhere that has no value as 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
But Warren and Bianchi are keenly aware of the pressures on ranchers to sell 
out. Land worth $500 an acre a few years ago now sells for $5,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Bianchi pointed out that some people simply are forced to sell. She spoke of a 
nearby family who must sell valuable water rights in order to pay the hospital 
bills of a parent suffering from Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
But Bianchi has less sympathy for most would-be sellers, including a cousin who 
wants to sell his piece of the family ranch to a developer with plans to 
subdivide the property into 40-acre "boutique ranches". 
</P>
<P>
"What in the world is a boutique ranch?" Warren asked her. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something they thought up in Los Angeles," Bianchi said.

U.S. FAILING TO CLOSE ITS EDUCATION GAP WITH JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

KYOTO, Japan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is causing America's competitive decline and its incorrigible trade 
deficit with Japan? That haunting question has been studied to death by the 
experts, but one little-known statistic suggests that study itself -- or the 
lack of it -- may be to blame. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the $50-billion U.S.-Japan trade gap is a bilateral "education gap" now 
hovering at a ratio of about 24 to 1. That is, while about 24,000 Japanese went 
to study in the United States in 1988, only 964 American students decided that 
they had something to learn on these high-tech islands. 
</P>
<P>
This lopsided exchange cuts across crucial fields of advanced science and 
technology research, where Japanese government agencies have tried in vain to 
entice larger numbers of Americans into their laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's brightest, meanwhile, continue to flock to the United States for study, 
years after this economic superstate outgrew its singular need to copy and 
absorb knowledge from the West while offering little in return. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the student is ready to become a teacher as well, but the United States 
does not seem to have the capacity -- or interest -- to knuckle down and study. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is potentially so critical that the U.S. National Research Council 
warned in a report last year that "resentment over the perceived imbalance in 
the flow of scientists and researchers . . . threatens to spill over into 
political and economic areas." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a special urgency associated with the question of access" to Japanese 
universities and research labs, the council said, "because of the very real 
prospect that frictions and restrictions could result if it is not effectively 
addressed soon enough." 
</P>
<P>
Belatedly, some educators on the American side of the Pacific are awakening to 
the need to train people for the challenges of tapping Japan's intellectual 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, for example, Stanford University opened an ambitious, $6.3-million 
facility in the city of Kyoto designed to train engineering majors in the ways 
of Japan, besides offering a more conventional program for humanities 
undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Center for Technology and Innovation joins a corporate internship 
program sponsored by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other 
sporadic efforts in a new strategy to get tomorrow's mainstream scientists and 
engineers hooked on Japan while they are young. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned about the 'not-invented-here' syndrome" that makes American 
laboratories and think tanks "insular," said Thomas Heller, director of 
Stanford's overseas programs. 
</P>
<P>
"A major part of this center is to have students appreciate the fact that there 
are going to be multiple science centers in the world, and that technology 
transfer among them is going to be increasingly important," Heller said. "The 
program, if it works well, will introduce to Japan a set of students who are 
headed for first-rate careers." 
</P>
<P>
So goes the theory. But other barriers remain, foremost among which is a myopic 
attitude on the part of American industry on the importance of the Japan 
experience. Traditionally, U.S. companies have been reluctant to recruit from 
the scarce supply of people proficient in Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States needs to open its eyes," said Michael J. Mintz, director of 
Dow Chemical's research and development office in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
"American industry today rarely rewards someone for having spent a year in 
Japan or (having) developed some facility in the language," Mintz said. "As 
long as that fundamental problem exists, there'll be a perception that there 
are barriers to Japanese technical information. But the only barriers are the 
ones we've installed." 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street has been one notable exception to this rule, offering lucrative 
salaries to Japan specialists from academia willing to try their hand at 
securities analysis in Tokyo's booming financial markets. But other fields have 
a terrible record, including journalism. 
</P>
<P>
A highly praised program at the Columbia University Graduate School of 
Journalism to train Japanese-speaking Americans as Tokyo correspondents was 
canceled last year because of alleged administrative bungling on the part of 
the university. The U.S.-Japan Friendship Commission, a federal agency, cut off 
funding and is looking for a new school to replace Columbia. So far, there are 
no takers. 
</P>
<P>
The American media have not shown much interest in the program either. Of the 
16 reporters graduated from the Columbia program since 1982, as many as seven 
are now employed by Reuters, the British wire service, having failed to land 
jobs at U.S. news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Stories abound of Americans being trained in Japan, then joining Japanese firms 
-- and contributing to Japan's side of the trade balance -- because no U.S. 
company would hire them. 
</P>
<P>
"We support a range of training programs in Japan, and I'd say 50% to 70% of 
the people are snapped up by anything but American firms," said an official at 
a U.S. government-funded foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Americans have really caught on," he said. "You give an American 
company the choice between hiring someone with an MBA or someone with a solid 
Japan background, and they'll hire the MBA on a heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of financial incentive appears to be one major reason why Japanese 
language study in U.S. schools trails far behind European languages, despite a 
recent surge in popularity. University enrollment in Japanese courses, 
according to the Modern Language Assn., rose sharply during the 1980s. By 1987, 
the latest year for which statistics are available, there were 23,454 students 
of Japanese in the universities. But that still pales by comparison to the 
hundreds of thousands of students who take French or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
Mintz, the Dow Chemical executive, is outraged that Japanese does not even 
fulfill foreign language requirements for most American doctoral programs in 
the sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Tokyo government, in answering U.S. trade complaints 
about Japan's "closed" economic structure, has criticized America's educational 
system -- its weakness in language study in general and its aversion for the 
Japanese tongue in particular. (English is a required subject in Japanese 
secondary schools, and English reading skills are needed to pass rigorous 
university entrance exams.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese courses are increasing at a "tremendous rate" at the high 
school level in the United States, the quality of instruction is low, said 
Eleanor H. Jorden, a linguist and authority on teaching Japanese at Johns 
Hopkins University's National Foreign Language Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a terrible shortage of trained teachers," Jorden said. "We have what I 
call the 'wife of the wrestling coach syndrome.' " 
</P>
<P>
Even two years of Japanese at the university level is inadequate, with few 
exceptions, to prepare anyone for serious study or work in Japan, Jorden and 
other Japan hands agree. True literacy in the language, normally written with 
about 2,000 Chinese characters, requires intensive study over many years. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people in the States are thinking about learning Japanese and coming 
here to strike it rich, but they're in for a surprise," said Billy Hornung, 20, 
a Yale University junior enrolled in Stanford's Kyoto program, which 
accommodates undergraduates from a consortium of U.S. colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Hornung got started early. He first came to Japan as a high school student from 
Austin, Tex., in an exchange program and lived with a family in Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely fell in love with Japan," he said. "We lived near a sushi bar, so 
that didn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
After coming back one summer to work in a fish market, Hornung decided to major 
in East Asian studies at Yale and try to master the Japanese language. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people come here for a year or two and learn a little Japanese from a 
girlfriend," he said, referring to the stream of free-lance English teachers 
who have included the likes of Jay McInerny, the young New York novelist. "They 
go back as experts, knowing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
America's poor language skills and shortsighted employers are not entirely to 
blame for the U.S.-Japan knowledge gap. Japan's university system is rigid, 
arcane and difficult to penetrate -- quite the opposite of the U.S. system, 
which attracted 365,000 foreign students last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Higher education is one exception to the rule that we're doing poorly in 
international markets," Stanford President Donald Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone once proposed having 100,000 foreign 
students in Japan by the end of the century, a vision that seems less 
extraordinary as the deadline approaches. In 1988, there was a total of 25,643 
foreigners studying here, nearly five times the number of 10 years earlier. The 
vast majority were from Asia; American students increased by less than twofold, 
from 584 to 964, in the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, however, many foreign students and researchers find that maddening 
rules can stifle creativity. The lack of transparency in the system makes it 
hard to know exactly what is going on. Japan is not an open society like the 
United States, which means that it is also difficult for a foreign student to 
feel accepted emotionally. An extensive survey by Keio University psychologist 
Sumiko Iwao, a former Fulbright student at Yale, found that the longer foreign 
students stay in Japan, the less they like it. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Japanese universities do not share the same reputation for excellence 
in teaching and research that makes American schools international magnets. 
That is especially true in basic research, the National Research Council study 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
"If Japan's university research system is not upgraded," it said, "the result 
could be to exacerbate resentments over what some perceive to be a 'closed' 
research system, in which the best work is carried out in industry labs that 
are much less accessible to foreigners." 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1988, Tokyo pledged $4.8 million to fund American 
researchers in positions at Japanese universities and government laboratories, 
offering grants through the U.S. National Science Foundation. But, so far, the 
response has been lukewarm.

SCALE OF PANAMA CORRUPTION HUGE; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTIGATION: NEW REGIME TARGETS 300 EX-OFFICIALS. RECORDS INDICATE 20% OF THE 
BUDGET WENT TO GRAFT.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Combing through the ruins of Manuel A. Noriega's dictatorship, Panamanian 
investigators have prepared more than 300 cases of corruption against former 
officials accused of bleeding the treasury through padded payrolls, illegal 
procurements and other embezzlement schemes. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence from the records that escaped systematic destruction by Noriega's 
fleeing supporters suggests that at least one-fifth of Panama's national budget 
was pilfered on salaries of political appointees who showed up at work only to 
collect paychecks, according to officials of the new U.S.-installed government. 
</P>
<P>
With Noriega in American custody and out of the country, Panamanians are 
turning their attention to the mess he left behind and how to clean it up. 
Officials looking into the files say they are finding the scale of corruption 
far greater than they imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't congratulate me," Mayor Guillermo Cochez told a well-wisher Thursday, 
the morning after invading U.S. troops took Noriega prisoner. "It's all 
craziness here. The public administration of the Noriega regime was based only 
on seeing how much they could steal. And what they stole was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
After a week at City Hall, Cochez has asked the new prosecutor to file charges 
in two corruption cases against his predecessor, Mayor Jilma Noriega, who once 
claimed to be a relative of Gen. Noriega but no longer does. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, she is accused of leasing a municipally-owned gasoline station to 
the Shell Oil Co. for 1/30th of the rent required by law, on the condition that 
Shell sublease it at a similar rate to a local company owned by one of her 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The other alleged scheme was more brazen. For the past four years, Cochez 
charged, Mayor Noriega personally raked off half the municipal tax payments 
delivered to City Hall each January -- about $10,000 per day for each day of 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with photos and newly discovered lists of people in Noriega's 
paramilitary Dignity Battalions, the new mayor has begun to fire potential 
troublemakers from the municipal payroll. In addition, he is working to 
identify and eliminate phantom workers who drew salaries while doing no work. 
</P>
<P>
The sudden purges, also under way in 12 government ministries, have put 
President Guillermo Endara's administration at odds with union leaders once 
supportive of Noriega. The conflict is already poisoning the wave of relief 
felt generally in Panama after Noriega's departure. 
</P>
<P>
Panama's justice system, corrupted during 21 years of military rule, is being 
revamped to settle such disputes and to try the growing docket of corruption 
cases. But judicial reform has been delayed, and complicated, by the sabotage 
of Supreme Court records the day after Noriega's ouster in the Dec. 20 U.S. 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Court workers have told Panamanian investigators that they saw one or more 
Supreme Court magistrates setting fire to their own files. A blaze swept 
through the court offices, on the top floor of the four-story Justice Ministry 
headquarters, destroying most of the case records. 
</P>
<P>
"What the fire didn't destroy the fire hoses did," said Cesar Quintero, one of 
eight newly appointed magistrates on the nine-member court. "This wasn't the 
work of common looters but high-level officials. They did this to make the new 
court's work difficult and to destroy old cases of justice being rigged and 
sold out." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the white colonial justice building, now abandoned, are computers, 
photocopiers, fax machines and filing cabinets methodically smashed with axes 
and iron bars. The new Supreme Court magistrates, who are to name lower court 
judges, are still looking for new quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Three other badly damaged agencies have been unable to reopen, including the 
Finance Ministry, where Noriega supporters mined the elevators with explosives 
before leaving. Col. Pasqual Gonzalez, the head of civil aviation, 
booby-trapped his own desk. 
</P>
<P>
"The order to the Dignity Battalions was to level the land, like Attila the 
Hun, destroy everything," said an investigator for the new government. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, he said, about 40 tons of files salvaged from government offices and 
homes of Noriega supporters have been taken to American military bases in 
Panama for scrutiny by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
American troops are also holding more than 50 top Panamanian military and 
civilian officials at a high-security jail on one of the bases. They are being 
questioned for information to bolster the federal drug-trafficking and 
money-laundering indictments against Noriega in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
The 300 criminal cases being prepared by Panamanian authorities are based on 
evidence gathered by the controller general, Panama's chief fiscal 
investigator, and sent to the attorney general. Both men were named by 
President Endara. 
</P>
<P>
The controller's oceanfront skyscraper headquarters sustained more than $1 
million in damage when rocket-firing U.S. helicopters tried to blow up the 
National Radio studios, lodged on a high floor. The building's rooftop power 
plant was destroyed instead, but the ground-floor computer room, a treasure 
chest of financial information, survived. 
</P>
<P>
Officials there said that about half the cases sent to the prosecutor's office 
last week had been investigated during Noriega's seven years in power but 
shelved on orders of his Panama Defense Forces. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the cases center on the growing economic power of the now-disbanded 
Defense Forces, which took profits out of everything from vehicle registration 
to import-export trade and became even wealthier as U.S. economic sanctions 
against Noriega drove the rest of the country into a deep recession. 
</P>
<P>
"There's everything in those files," an investigator said. "Widespread 
corruption, money laundering, contraband, graft, payola. . . . It was a big 
business!" 
</P>
<P>
While such practices had become well-publicized political grievances against 
Noriega, Panamanian officials said they are no less stunned by what they have 
found. They said it has deepened their conviction that the U.S. intervention 
was justified. 
</P>
<P>
"The extent of the corruption was more than we thought," Controller General 
Ruben Carles said in an interview. "We didn't know how deeply the military was 
involved (in the economy). Now we are seeing this monstrosity from the inside. 
The possibilities of getting these people out (of power) except by force would 
have been zero." 
</P>
<P>
He said that the Defense Forces used the National Bank of Panama, which is now 
under investigation, to conceal their financial dealings "with overdrawn 
accounts, phony loans, destroying of documents that were backing up loans and 
concessions." 
</P>
<P>
In the first major embarrassment for the new administration, Col. Roberto 
Armijo was forced to resign last week as chief of Panama's new Capital Public 
Security Force after auditors discovered that he and members of his family had 
more than $1.2 million in certificates of deposit in that bank. 
</P>
<P>
Another entity under investigation is Transit S.A., a private company managed 
by Carlos Duque, Noriega's handpicked presidential candidate in the elections 
of last May. 
</P>
<P>
Transit was authorized to impose a "service fee" on most trade through the 
Colon Free Zone (a merchandise transshipment facility, free of customs duties) 
and turned the revenues -- $275 million a year, according to U.S. sources -- 
over to Noriega's family and a few high-ranking military officers. The company 
has been taken over by the state and the fee has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
While Duque remains at large, new information on Transit is coming from Rafael 
Ceballos, his top deputy at the company for 18 years. In an interview two weeks 
ago, before surrendering to U.S. and Panamanian authorities in Colon, Ceballos 
said that he kept records of "every single check" and is willing to spill the 
company's secrets. 
</P>
<P>
While a full picture of corruption under Noriega will take months to emerge, 
several government officials said it was far more costly to Panama than the 
U.S. sanctions aimed at getting rid of him. The total value of Panama's economy 
shrank 40% in 1988 and 1989, after the sanctions were imposed, and unemployment 
climbed to at least 30%. 
</P>
<P>
As it seeks $1.2 billion in emergency aid from the United States, the Endara 
government is scrambling to eliminate phantom employees and thus save hundreds 
of millions of dollars in salaries.

<P>
Such an employee is known here as a botella, or bottle. Some Panamanians say 
the term is meant to suggest an empty bottle, something that has outlived its 
usefulness; others say it stems from the image of a bum drinking booze from a 
bottle instead of working. 
</P>
<P>
The presidential palace payroll, at the time of the American invasion, was 
top-heavy with bottles, according to Miguel Batista, the new vice minister 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Of 360 employees, he said, the first 47 below Noriega's handpicked president, 
Francisco Rodriguez, did not work in the palace. All earned between $1,500 and 
$3,000 per month and held such titles as "coordinator of planning" and 
"executive assistant." Some were union leaders who really worked elsewhere and 
drew two or more salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the only ones we've discovered so far in this ministry because they 
are notorious cases," Batista said, studying a computer printout of the 
payroll. "We are going to keep investigating, and surely more botellas will 
appear. In all government institutions, we've found this phenomenon."

East German Communist Party leader Gregor Gysi proposed Saturday that both East 
and West Germany cut their armed forces in half by the end of this year and 
that all foreign troops in their territories depart before the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Both German states must make a beginning with demilitarization in Central 
Europe," Gysi told a special meeting of the Communist Party leadership, 
according to the official East German news agency ADN. 
</P>
<P>
Gysi's demilitarization plan also includes the removal of training areas in a 
50-mile-wide strip along the inner German border and severe limitations on 
troops deployed in the frontier area. 
</P>
<P>
As party leader, Gysi is not a member of the current East German government, 
but his proposals are thought to reflect his concern about the Communist Party 
being able to mount a credible, popular platform for the May national 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
At present, the East German armed forces total 175,000 soldiers, while West 
Germany's troop strength is 494,000. Both armies are considered among the best 
in their respective defense alliances, the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 380,000 Soviet troops based in East Germany, while in West 
Germany, about 246,000 American soldiers are stationed, along with 67,000 
British and 50,000 French soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union has announced plans to unilaterally withdraw 50,000 troops 
from Central Europe, including East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"The Allies are urged," said Gysi, "to prepare their troops for complete, 
planned withdrawal in stages by 1999, beginning with the border zone." 
</P>
<P>
Gysi tied in the disarmament proposal with the various calls for German 
reunification made on both sides of the border. 
</P>
<P>
"Without an end to military rivalry between the two German states," he said, 
"any talk of unity of the nation is not credible." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the reduced tensions in Europe, both Bonn and the United States have 
indicated they will reduce troop strength in West Germany, though no final 
figures have been established. 
</P>
<P>
The 23-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe is meeting in 
Vienna to seek drastic reductions in troops and armaments in the two alliances 
"from the Atlantic to the Urals." 
</P>
<P>
Gysi also urged the withdrawal of all chemical and nuclear weapons from both 
German states by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the Urals and the Atlantic," he said, "there should be no nuclear 
weapons, no biological or chemical weapons, no tanks, cannons, bombers or 
combat helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"The military blocs must be dissolved in this Europe. In all countries, there 
will be weapons only for the police inasmuch as they need them to fight crime 
and terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Communist Party on Saturday called for a party congress on March 
17-18 to prepare for the May elections. 
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party is attempting to reform itself, having ousted veteran 
leader Erich Honecker and replacing his successor, Egon Krenz, in early 
December with Gysi, a reform-minded lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
In various remarks, party leaders have said they did not believe the Communists 
could achieve a majority in the May elections. 
</P>
<P>
But some East and West German leaders are concerned about whether the 
Communists will actually give opposition groups the opportunity to conduct a 
proper election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a spokesman for the West German opposition Social Democrats, Hans 
Buechler, said in a radio interview Saturday that Chancellor Helmut Kohl should 
threaten to cancel future talks with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow 
unless opposition groups are given access to newspapers and television. 
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to the government to make sure, if necessary by halting negotiations, 
that really free elections with equal rights can take place," Buechler 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
And in Leipzig on Saturday, the leading East German opposition group, New 
Forum, began a two-day meeting to discuss its own tactics in proposing 
candidates to run in the national elections. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Greens in West Germany, New Forum leaders are split on the issue of 
whether they should become a formal political party or remain a loosely knit 
opposition movement without a hard-and-fast platform and running only a token 
number of candidates in the election.

When a nervous Alexander N. Varivoda walked into Communist Party headquarters 
here on a snowy morning a month ago, he was about to end a 10-year commitment 
by dropping out of the organization he had once so proudly joined. 
</P>
<P>
"When I handed in my membership card, my hands were actually shaking," the 
41-year-old factory worker said. "I had thought about it for a long time, but I 
was still apprehensive. I knew once I quit, there was no turning back." 
</P>
<P>
It was far different, he recalled, from the spring day in 1979 when he became 
the first person in his family to join the party. Then, the party's first 
secretary grinned and shook his hand, and his wife hugged him. 
</P>
<P>
"On that day, I was happy," he said bitterly. "But it seems long ago. Now, I'm 
finished with the Communist Party for good." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Soviet Union, the list of those joining the Communist Party in 
the last year has shortened dramatically. Although officials have declined to 
make public the number of new party members, some say privately it may have 
reached an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
In Lithuania, previously staunch Communist Party members are deciding to leave 
the party by the thousands. The republic's leaders say it is in part a result 
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or greater openness, 
which has permitted free discussion here of how Lithuanians, among other 
nationalities, were victims of Stalinist era crimes. 
</P>
<P>
In the last year, party officials say, about 6,500 people in Lithuania quit the 
party, while only about 850 joined. 
</P>
<P>
This is a significant turnaround in a country where Communist Party members 
traditionally have been viewed as among the most idealistic and powerful and 
where tombstones list the year the deceased got his party card right next to 
the year of birth. 
</P>
<P>
A faction of the republic's Communist Party, representing at least 80% of its 
200,000 cardholders, has decided to declare its independence, prompting a 
crisis with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The breakaway group believes the growing unpopularity of Communists in this 
largest of the three Baltic republics made such a move necessary if the party 
is to win any seats in February elections to the local congress. They have 
stressed this point to Gorbachev in a series of meetings and telephone 
conversations, most recently during a session Thursday in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev reportedly remains unpersuaded and will travel this week to this 
republic of 3.5 million sandwiched between Poland and Latvia to try to hammer 
out a compromise to mend the first split in the Communist Party in more than 80 
years of Soviet rule. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the daring displayed by the Lithuanian 
party in declaring its independence has given it a boost in popularity that 
most political analysts here predict will be visible at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
However, for some, like Varivoda, it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
Varivoda's grandfather was among those taken away in the middle of the night 
and killed during the Stalinist purges in the 1940s. Lithuania, along with the 
other Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia, was independent until August, 
1940, when it was absorbed into the Soviet Union under a secret pact between 
Josef Stalin and Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after the loss of independence, tens of thousands of people from 
the Baltics were deported in massive sweeps, including businessmen, prosperous 
farmers and any potential political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"Until glasnost, no one really told me anything about what happened to my 
grandfather. We were all expected to believe in our party leaders, and we all 
did," Varivoda, a tall man who smelled of cigarette smoke, said during a work 
break in the computer-making factory as he sat playing dominoes with three 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
"But then, under Gorbachev, we found out about Stalin and about the corruption 
of other party leaders. Being a cardholding Communist was no longer something 
to be proud of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Varivoda said he began considering quitting the party three years ago but was 
afraid he would lose his job or that his family would suffer some sort of 
repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Lithuanian Congress passed a law that stated no punitive 
measures could be taken against anyone who quit the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, my wife was worried," Varivoda said. "We spoke about the possibility 
that I might be fired. Then we decided together that quitting the party was the 
right thing to do. I wasn't raised to support corruption and evil." 
</P>
<P>
Another domino player, Pavel N. Shipkov, also recently handed in his Communist 
card after eight years as a party member. 
</P>
<P>
"I was approached by the party chief in my plant and asked to join, simply to 
fulfill the quotas they had that year. I agreed without thinking," said 
Shipkov, 30. 
</P>
<P>
"I quickly discovered that even as a party member, the simple worker has no 
real power here. When my friends asked me why I was a member of the party, I 
had no good answer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid to quit at first, because I thought they would take away the 
communal apartment we live in, which is supplied by the factory. But when I saw 
my friends quitting and saw nothing was happening to them, I decided I could, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
At the factory where Shipkov and Varivoda work, about 10% of all party 
cardholders have quit in the last year, leaving about 650 party members among 
4,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
These are figures that are particularly alarming to men like Albinas Dastikas, 
who, as the Communist ideology chief at the plant, serves as a kind of 
counselor to those suffering from doubts about the worthiness of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Dastikas said that despite many hours of talking, he has been able to persuade 
only two workers so far not to go ahead with their plans to hand in their 
membership cards. 
</P>
<P>
"Glasnost revealed the true character of our leadership, and it was a great 
blow to the workers," Dastikas said. 
</P>
<P>
"It even raised some questions in my own mind," he acknowledged. "But I decided 
that a man who is not part of the collective is just an empty vessel. And 
besides, I'm only 40. I still have strength to fight the battle for a better 
party."

<P>
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze spent Saturday meeting with 
Romania's new leaders and afterward said that he promised them the Soviet 
Union's "political, material and moral support." 
</P>
<P>
He said that talks on economic cooperation will begin "in the near future" and 
promised Romania increased shipments of oil and natural gas to help its 23 
million citizens get through the winter with homes heated to near-normal levels 
for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said he was "moved" by his sessions with the National Salvation 
Front leaders and the provisional government, which will run the country until 
elections are held in April. 
</P>
<P>
"Never before have I come to a country with such feelings of emotion which I 
experienced here today on Romanian soil," Shevardnadze said. "The feeling is in 
my heart, and is always present whenever you make history. And there is no 
doubt that the Romanian revolution is a phenomenon in Romanian and world 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"The people with whom I talked told me of the great hardships and difficulties 
the country must overcome to do away with the inheritance of the dictator." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet foreign minister's visit came 12 days after Romanian dictator 
Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed by a military firing 
squad. In power for 24 years, Ceausescu's grim police state was an obvious 
embarrassment to the Soviet Union throughout the period of Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"By comparison with the past," Shevardnadze said, "I must say the atmosphere 
was absolutely purified. It was, if I may say so, full of oxygen and quite 
pleasant to be here." He said that his meetings Saturday "will lead to better 
development." 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet people have great enthusiasm for the (Romanian) revolution," he 
said. "They have expressed their wish to support the revolution. This is in 
line with the process of perestroika," the Soviet term for restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not accept dictatorship," he said. "That is why we started our 
revolution, which is called perestroika. An important feature of our revolution 
is the democratization of politics, society and economic relations in our 
country. Dictatorship cannot be accepted, neither a Communist dictatorship nor 
a bourgeois one." 
</P>
<P>
Meeting with journalists, Shevardnadze said the Soviet Union has no intention 
of attempting to influence the direction of the new government or of the April 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
"What specific parties will lead Romania is the business of the Romanians," he 
said. "We shall always obey the will of the people." 
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Soviet republic of Moldavia, Shevardnadze said restrictions 
will be lifted on both sides of the Romanian and Soviet border, allowing 
relatives on both sides to visit either country. "In that way," he said, "some 
of the problems will be solved." 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the Soviets had sent Romania about 130 railroad cars of 
medical supplies, valued at 1.5 million rubles, and had offered 8,000 hospital 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
He said Romania is receiving daily 22 million cubic meters of natural gas and 
that the Soviet Union will send 390,000 tons of oil this month. "We also intend 
to supply other sources of energy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He added that the Soviet Union will no longer receive imports of meat and dairy 
products from Romania. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear just how much meat the Romanians have been supplying to the 
Soviets in recent years in exchange for oil, but Romanian stores have been 
barren for years, with meat and dairy products virtually non-existent for 
ordinary consumers.

61 ADOPTED ROMANIAN CHILDREN MET BY NEW FAMILIES IN FRANCE

A plane carrying 61 Romanian children whose adoptions by French parents had 
been blocked by Nicolae Ceausescu's government landed Saturday to a joyful 
welcome from their new families. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in debt to the Romanian people for winning freedom for these children," 
said Jacques Lellioz, of St. Nazaire in western France, who waited more than 
three years for his adopted daughter, Maeva. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have liked a little more intimacy, with everything more discreet," 
Lellioz said amid the tumult of reporters and television cameras covering the 
arrival of the government-chartered plane at Orly Airport. 
</P>
<P>
A planeload of anxious adoptive parents flew to Bucharest on Saturday to meet 
their children. Also on Saturday, an Italian air force plane flew from the 
Romanian capital to Italy with more orphans for waiting parents. 
</P>
<P>
Philippe Chabin's daughter, Roxanna, opened presents from her new French 
cousins after rushing into the arms of her adopted father, who had staged two 
hunger strikes to try to pressure the Romanian government into letting her go. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, hundreds of French parents sought and found children in 
Romania when the demand for adoptive children in France was greater than 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu's policies encouraging large families, combined with widespread 
shortages of food and other necessities, produced large numbers of children 
available for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
The prospective parents had to pay thousands of dollars in official fees and 
often thousands more to corrupt officials to get a child. 
</P>
<P>
But in July, 1988, Ceausescu's government halted any new adoption cases for 
foreign parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We are happy for the happy futures of these children," Dumitru Mazilu, a 
Romanian government official, said at a short ceremony organized at the 
Bucharest airport.

CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM DUELS ERUPT IN BEIRUT

<P>
Christian and Muslim militias battled in fiery duels across Beirut on Saturday, 
killing two civilians and forcing police to close the only gateway linking the 
divided city. It was the first serious flare-up in three months. 
</P>
<P>
The clashes coincided with the arrival of President Elias Hrawi in Muslim West 
Beirut, where he set up his office and residence and received credentials of 
the Vatican representative, Pablo Puente. 
</P>
<P>
The action marked the Vatican's recognition of Hrawi's government and further 
isolated the Christian army leader, Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, in his rejection of 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun's supporters, at his request, staged a "human chain of demonstrations" 
along the 25-mile route from Aoun's residence to Puente's home to protest the 
Vatican's move. 
</P>
<P>
Other protesters went to Puente's home to deliver a message of protest from 
Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
Thunderous shell blasts and bursts of gunfire echoed across the Muslim and 
Christian sectors as soldiers of Aoun's army battled with Syrian-backed Muslim 
militiamen. Both sides accused the other of shooting first. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the clash was "the gravest violation" of a cease-fire 
called by the Arab League on Sept. 22 to halt six months of fighting between 
Aoun's troops and Syrian forces. Until Saturday, there had been only minor 
clashes. 
</P>
<P>
An artillery shell crashed into the Christian side of Beirut and killed two 
civilian men, police said. Two other people were wounded in exchanges that 
engulfed nearby districts. 
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out in the morning, eased at noon and picked up again in the 
afternoon, forcing police and army units to close the mid-city Museum Crossing, 
the only gateway linking Muslim West Beirut and Christian East Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
The latest deaths brought to 931 the number of people killed in 
Christian-Muslim duels since Aoun in March declared his intention of driving 
Syria's 40,000 troops out of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
Aoun rejects Hrawi's presidency because it came about as a result of an Arab 
League plan aimed at ending the 14-year-old civil war but not setting a 
deadline for the withdrawal of the Syrians. 
</P>
<P>
All foreign countries with diplomatic missions in Lebanon have recognized 
Hrawi's "national reconciliation" government, which was formed in November to 
oversee implementation of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Puente said during the Vatican credentials ceremony that the Holy See favors 
dialogue to resolve the crisis between Hrawi and Aoun. 
</P>
<P>
But a stung Aoun later emerged from his residence outside Beirut and told 
cheering demonstrators that "there is no room for dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
He drew wild applause when he vowed to bring to justice Hrawi and all 
Parliament members who approved the peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
Hrawi, who like Aoun is a Maronite Catholic, fired Aoun as army commander and 
interim prime minister in November. 
</P>
<P>
Hrawi and his wife, Mona, arrived in West Beirut in a 10-car convoy escorted by 
Lebanese army and police units. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fighting raged in southern Lebanon between militiamen of the 
pro-Iranian Hezbollah and the Syrian-backed Amal. No new casualties were 
reported.

The Arab League called on the United States on Saturday to lift sanctions 
against Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi's government. 
</P>
<P>
It said the restrictions are damaging Arab-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush notified Congress on Thursday that he would be extending the 
existing sanctions for another year, saying Libya continues to support 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Tunis-based Arab League said the U.S. perpetuation of the 
sanctions "is all the more regrettable because efforts are under way to 
substitute an era of peace and security for the tensions known in the Middle 
East."

KHMER ROUGE CLAIMS ATTACK ON CAMBODIA'S NO. 2 CITY

The Communist Khmer Rouge claimed early today that its forces had attacked 
Cambodia's second-largest city, Battambang, and that the provincial capital was 
ablaze hours after the attack was launched. 
</P>
<P>
There was no independent confirmation of the attack, announced on the Khmer 
Rouge's radio and monitored in Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
But if true, it would represent a stunning blow to the Vietnamese-backed 
government in Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
In what appeared to herald the start of a new offensive against the Phnom Penh 
government, guerrilla forces also attacked positions in western Pursat province 
and in northwestern Bamteay Meanchey province, the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Cambodian government troops attempted to bring up tanks 
from positions along Route 10, which runs from Battambang to the border town of 
Pailin, which the Khmer Rouge captured on Oct. 22 after a month of fierce 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The radio said the government troops were "partly routed" in the fighting along 
Route 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Battambang town burned brightly from 1 a.m. on Jan. 6," the radio said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no comment from Phnom Penh. 
</P>
<P>
The loss of Battambang would be a major psychological blow to the Cambodian 
governments, as well as cutting off most of western Cambodia from supplies.

INTIFADA LEAVES MANY ISRAELIS FEELING LIKE STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LAND; 
</P>
<P>
MIDDLE EAST: THEIR EXPRESSIONS OF FEAR CHALLENGE THE OFFICIAL WISDOM THAT 
ISRAEL HAS ADJUSTED TO THE ARAB UPRISING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

BET SHEMESH, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps the most striking impact of the Arab uprising on Israeli life is that 
the Palestinians have managed to make Israelis feel less at home than ever 
before in the 41-year history of the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
This may seem curious given Israel's military might, not to mention the toll of 
more than 600 Palestinian lives during the two years of turmoil. But in recent 
conversations in half a dozen Israeli towns with a score of residents, reserve 
soldiers included, a picture of extreme discomfort among Israelis emerges. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what the intifada means to them, they responded with some variation 
on a single theme: the intifada scares them; it makes them strangers in their 
own land, not just in the occupied and disputed territories of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. It is a Zionist nightmare: Having come to Israel to shed the 
hostilities of the Diaspora, Israelis find themselves in endless animosity, not 
just from across the borders but in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
Every street corner is a potential conflict, every mundane encounter a possible 
clash. Last week, a Palestinian worker at a Jerusalem restaurant was charged 
with poisoning salad with insecticide after four customers became severely ill 
after eating there. 
</P>
<P>
The expressions of fear by Israelis challenge the current official wisdom that 
Israel has adjusted to the Arab uprising. Although Israelis did comment on the 
severe punishment dealt to the Palestinian population, the limits on their own 
personal freedom resulting from the intifada provoked near-rage. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone seemed anxious for some solution and, like the wildly gyrating Israeli 
public surveys on the subject, the preferred solution alternated between a 
willingness to sort out the problems with the Palestinians and a yearning to 
end the conflict by expelling Palestinians en masse from the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
Ideological concerns were secondary: Neither the expansionist dreams common to 
Israel's rightist camp nor the ardent soul-searching characteristic of the left 
was much in evidence. Even in religious neighborhoods, biblical considerations 
of God's will in the matter took a back seat to questions of personal safety. 
</P>
<P>
Peace talks, tentatively scheduled to begin in Washington in the coming weeks, 
appeared to be far less daunting than the prospect of living in perpetual fear, 
even among the many who expressed profound mistrust of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
Over coffee at the Shimson Meeting Place cafe outside the small town of Bet 
Shemesh, truck driver Moshe Ashkenazi complained of a feeling of confinement. 
</P>
<P>
"I own trucks. We used to transport things from the territories. There are 
places I want to go to, but the rocks break my windows every day. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a gun, but the gun license says it is for self-defense. If I go to the 
territories, I can't use the weapon. You know, if they throw stones and hit 
you, you can die. If they try to kill a Jew, we can't protect ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"We Jews have to choose whether to go in and, in order to stay alive, get in 
trouble, or get out. So most people stop going. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make clear to the American people and the world at large that our 
enemy is not civilized, but primitive. Most Israeli people support the 
government decision not to talk to (Palestine Liberation Organization leader) 
Yasser Arafat, whose hands are full of blood. Instead, we want to talk to 
people who live here." 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the Shimson Meeting Place, Shlomo Malka, came over with more 
coffee. "It's a mess. We should find a place for them and give them a state -- 
on the other side of the Jordan River. Could be Gaza, but some place completely 
separate. It's a question of security." 
</P>
<P>
At the Mahaneh Yehuda market in Jerusalem, almost any kind of pickled fish, 
spice and salads are available, but usually only one kind of political opinion: 
right-wing and anti-Arab. 
</P>
<P>
So it came as something of a surprise to hear Boaz Zidkiyahu, a purveyor of 
pungent Oriental salads, say that talk is the best way to get out of the tangle 
of the intifada. 
</P>
<P>
"There are solutions. We must sit down and talk with local residents of the 
territories. Not with the PLO, that's for sure. I am in favor of sitting down 
and talking, because the way things are now, there will be no end, not for us 
and not for them. 
</P>
<P>
"The intifada has placed great limits on Jews in their own land. People in 
Jerusalem can not even go to the Old City without a certain element of danger. 
Israelis in the territories have great difficulty traveling to their places of 
work and employment. In contrast, the Arabs can come into our areas, and feel 
much better among us than we do among them. In fact, the Arabs feel more 
comfortable in our areas than we do." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a guerrilla war," exclaimed Itzik Avraha, a fruit vendor. "It will 
continue for a long time; it will be very hard to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind any solution so long as it brings us rest. Maybe they should have 
a state in Jordan. What do I care about the West Bank? Even Jerusalem, with the 
special feeling we have for it, is not worth the life of one soldier." 
</P>
<P>
Eli Pasha, another vendor, remarked: "I am worried about the influence it has 
on my children; things will only get worse, not better. Once they were just 
Arabs, like there are Jews and there are Moroccans; an Arab was an Arab like 
any other human being. Today, we see it differently, like to be an Arab is to 
be terrifying." 
</P>
<P>
Bnei Brak is a religious neighborhood near Tel Aviv, a place seemingly distant 
from the intifada. Most young men from there do not serve in the army, 
receiving instead exemptions for religious studies. Still, even there a pall of 
uncertainty prevails. 
</P>
<P>
Raphael, a 23-year-old yeshiva student, was idling at a wedding hall waiting 
for festivities to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a catastrophe," he said of the uprising. "In our own state, we can't live 
in peace. The Arabs walk around in Bnei Brak and feel more secure than we do. 
He looks at us like he owns us. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife is very scared. There are lots of Arab workers around. They do 
construction work. My wife is afraid to walk in the street -- only since the 
intifada. We don't even think of going to the territories. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a radical, (but) maybe we should deal with them more harshly. I don't 
hate Arabs, but if they find reason to kill us, well, it's our state. If they 
don't like us, they should get out. 
</P>
<P>
"Every part of the land of Israel is holy, but for the peace, the rabbis say, 
we are allowed to give some back. But everything you give the Arabs they want 
more. There has to be real peace. We have to get something back in return." 
</P>
<P>
Grocer Naimrod Yovel, manning the cash register at his nearby shop, commented: 
"We should deal with the Arabs like the Arabs deal with themselves, like in 
Algeria; (or) kill 200 in one day, like Syria would. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a small spice factory in the territories and sold food over there. Now I 
don't go. People are scared to go. It's crazy to go. 
</P>
<P>
"There is land enough to give some away. Not Jerusalem -- ever. But other 
places.

SHORT, SWEET TRAIL LEADS TO STOLEN TRUCK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A trail of pies and doughnuts led police Saturday to a bakery truck that had 
been stolen in Northridge while the driver was away from the vehicle making a 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like Hansel and Gretel except for bigger pieces," Police Sgt. Paul 
Haberman said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck was abandoned a few blocks from the scene of the crime. The thief 
fled and had not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The Van de Kamp's bakery truck driver was making a delivery at the Lucky Market 
in Northridge about 2:15 a.m. and had left the truck with its engine running, 
Officer Rich Rashi said. 
</P>
<P>
"The truck driver came out of the store to get back to his truck as it was 
being driven out of the parking lot (by the suspect)," Rashi said. "The 
tailgate was still down and all the Van de Kamp's merchandise fell out as he 
was driving away. 
</P>
<P>
"Doughnuts and pies and bagels, wheat germ bread, double double chocolate cake 
with nuts on top -- all this was falling out of the truck," Rashi said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness to the theft followed the bakery truck out of the parking lot but 
lost sight of it a few blocks away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers took the report from the bakery driver, then headed up the street to 
the area where the truck was last seen. 
</P>
<P>
"We drove up (the street) and there were more bakery goods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The officers followed the diminishing trail of baked goods and found the truck 
abandoned a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two cherry pies and an angel food cake left in the truck," Rashi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated that between $800 and $1,000 worth of pastry and baked goods 
were destroyed. The truck was undamaged and returned to the driver.

FREE PET TATTOOING OFFERED BY COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EUGENE AHN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pet owners brought their dogs, cats and even a snake to animal clinics Saturday 
to launch a county program designed to increase the chances of reuniting lost 
pets with their masters by tattooing identification numbers onto the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Although the snake was not eligible, about 300 other pets were tattooed free of 
charge and their numbers recorded in a computer database, said Frank Andrews, 
director of the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to think of some way to improve the dismal number of animals 
who are returned to their owners," Andrews said. "This seems to be a good way 
to improve the bad image of our dogcatchers." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said animals tattooed with license information can be traced to their 
owners immediately through computer records. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this, he said, tattooing should also help ease overcrowding at 
animal shelters and prevent lost pets from ending up in research labs. 
</P>
<P>
Animal control officers have been trained to look for a dime-sized green dot 
tattooed inside the ears of stray animals, Andrews said. 
</P>
<P>
If a dot is there, then the officer knows an identification number can be found 
"inconspicuously" tattooed in the animal's groin area. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been so successful, Andrews said, that in its first three weeks 
of testing last month, seven tattooed animals who ran away from home were 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said all county animal shelters soon will be equipped with tattoo 
equipment, and the procedure will be performed at no cost indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 pets countywide have been tattooed so far. 
</P>
<P>
"The procedure is relatively painless," Andrews said. "Most bigger animals, fat 
animals and large animals just lay there and let it happen, but some kitties 
object to the buzzing noise." 
</P>
<P>
Andrews said officials expect to have about 10,000 animals tattooed and filed 
on computer by the end of the year.

UNITED WAY'S $95-MILLION GOAL REACHES HALFWAY MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since its start in September, the United Way's fund-raising campaign has 
yielded a record $50 million dollars -- more than half of the charity's goal 
for this year, a spokesman announced. 
</P>
<P>
Campaign chairman James P. Miscoll said the organization was already 9% ahead 
of last year's campaign, which netted $88.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
This year's goal is $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
In his first "progress report," released last week, Miscoll attributed the 
campaign's success to an increase in giving in all major categories. Corporate 
giving was up 8%. Employee contributions, which normally represent about 
two-thirds of campaign revenues, increased by 10%. Miscoll also noted an 
increase in giving by members of organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
"These efforts will result in expanded capacity to serve our communities 
through the 350 health and human service agencies United Way supports," Miscoll 
said.

CHINESE HEALTH EXPERTS WARN AGAINST PRACTICE OF 'DAY CARE' SANDBAGGING

<P>
Chinese health experts on Saturday warned parents in northern China against 
placing their infants in sandbags, a traditional practice they said may lead to 
mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
As a form of rural day care, peasant parents in north China have for hundreds 
of years put their children in large, stationary bags of fine sand, tied at the 
waist. 
</P>
<P>
The infants can stretch their legs somewhat in the sand but cannot crawl out, 
and the sand acts as a diaper that is changed daily. The infants are removed 
from the bags only for feeding. 
</P>
<P>
But the China Daily, a state-run newspaper, reported that experts from the 
China Children's Development Center had issued a warning against the practice 
after conducting a survey that indicated the sandbags can cause health 
problems, including mental retardation. 
</P>
<P>
The experts told the English-language newspaper that the practice has been 
found "extremely harmful" to infants, affecting their height, weight and 
intelligence. Many of the sandbag-reared children are shorter and skinnier than 
the general population, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The research survey, conducted in Hebei and Shandong provinces in northeast 
China, found that 70% of the 400 "sandbag children" surveyed had been kept 
confined for as much as 20 hours each day before the age of 2. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30% of the children, now around 10 years old, were found to be slightly 
mentally retarded. The incidence of rickets was also 20% higher than in the 
general population because the infants could not move around and exercise, the 
China Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
"Their intelligence develops sluggishly due to lack of stimulation from 
activities and surroundings in the brain's formative period, when they are left 
alone lying in sandbags," a researcher told the newspaper.

MAN LEAVING CLEVELAND STADIUM IS KILLED IN FALL FROM ESCALATOR

<P>
A man who attended Saturday's NFL playoff game at Cleveland Stadium was killed 
when he fell from the side of an escalator, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuyahoga County coroner's office identified the man as Daniel Bulmahn, 52, 
of Tonawanda, N.Y., a Buffalo suburb. 
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred moments after the Cleveland Browns defeated the Buffalo 
Bills, 34-30. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no indication of any horseplay or fight," said police 
dispatcher Michael Goga. "It was purely an accident, according to his friends." 
</P>
<P>
Goga said Bulmahn and several friends were on the escalator from the upper 
level of the stadium when Bulmahn apparently stumbled and fell over the side, 
18 to 25 feet onto William Bauer, 31, of Vickery, Ohio. Bauer suffered a minor 
head injury, Goga said.

SANTA ANITA / BOB MIESZERSKI; 
</P>
<P>
A PROFITABLE DAY FOR DELAHOUSSAYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a big day for Eddie Delahoussaye -- on and off the track. 
</P>
<P>
After being absolved of blame by the stewards for the disqualification of 
Excellent Lady in Friday's third race, Delahoussaye came through with four 
consecutive winners Saturday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
The quadruple, that put him into a tie with Chris McCarron and Alex Solis atop 
the jockey standings, was completed when Stormy But Valid held off Survive's 
late rally in the $84,100 Las Flores Breeders' Cup Handicap before a crowd of 
27,142. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking his fourth consecutive riding title after leading at Del Mar, Oak Tree 
and Hollywood Park, Delahoussaye avoided a five-day suspension after meeting 
with the stewards Saturday morning to discuss Excellent Lady's race. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Delahoussaye) did switch sticks (change his whip from one hand to the 
other) and did make a reasonable effort to keep the horse straight," steward 
Pete Pedersen said. "He only came in a foot or two. It was a very complicated 
decision because a lot was happening at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Shocked when the filly's number came down Friday, Delahoussaye was delighted he 
wasn't forced to take some time off. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping I wouldn't get a suspension because I thought I did all I could," 
he said. "If they had given me days, I would have appealed (to the California 
Horse Racing Board). And I've never appealed a suspension before. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody hollered out there and, looking at the films, I thought (Ying N' Yang, 
the runner-up Friday) shied away from my filly. We didn't make any contact. I'm 
glad it worked out the way it did as far as them not suspending me." 
</P>
<P>
After failing with his first two mounts, Delahoussaye won the fifth with 
Phantom X, who bounced back nicely after finishing last in the Hollywood 
Futurity, the sixth on favored Indian Wind, who was fortunate to beat an 
unlucky Ltd Edition, the seventh aboard J.T.s Pet, who came from last, and then 
finished with Stormy But Valid. 
</P>
<P>
Now perfect in three main track starts at Santa Anita, Stormy But Valid tracked 
pace-setters Warning Zone, Solid Eight and Josette early, took the lead inside 
the final furlong, then survived Survive's charge to win by a head in a stakes 
record 1:08 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
Owned by Jan, Mace and Samantha Siegel and trained by Brian Mayberry, the 
4-year-old daughter of Valid Appeal has been a model of consistency. She now 
has six wins from 14 starts and has only been off the board twice. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a hard-trying little filly," Delahoussaye said. "I could hear (track 
announcer) Trevor (Denman) calling the other horse and I said, 'I better get 
after her.' I'm glad the wire was there. 
</P>
<P>
"But she was really digging in. She couldn't have gone much faster. Brian's 
really done a great job with her." 
</P>
<P>
Like Delahoussaye, Mayberry is off to a quick start at Santa Anita. The Las 
Flores was his fifth win in the first 10 days, putting him one up on Neil 
Drysdale, Ed Gregson, Jerry Fanning and Danny Velasquez in the trainer's race. 
</P>
<P>
"That's cutting it close," Mayberry said. "She loves this track and I thought 
she'd win today, but I didn't know she was going to cause that little 
palpitation in my heart. She's a genuine little filly -- always gives her best. 
She's kind of diminutive, but all heart. 
</P>
<P>
"She does anything you want her to do. The track's playing kind of fast, so I 
told Eddie I wanted her close to the pace." 
</P>
<P>
The team of Siegel and Mayberry has been a potent factor locally for several 
years. Stormy But Valid's victory followed an impressive debut by T.V. Lord, a 
gelded son of Sir Gaylord, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"We try hard," Mayberry said. "We've got a program that we follow and it's paid 
off. Mr. Siegel let's me have carte blanche. We look for good conformation and 
as much pedigree as we can afford. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a good combination to be successful. The right owner and right 
trainer hook up and it can be fun. We've been together about 14 years, so you 
know he's a very patient man." 
</P>
<P>
Also partial to the track, Survive, the 5-1 fourth choice, just missed while 
being helped by the swift (:21 1/5 and :43 4/5) early fractions. 
</P>
<P>
"One more jump," rider Russell Baze said. "I'd just as soon get beat 100 
lengths as a nose. She ran well. She's a hard-trying little critter. She always 
tries. 
</P>
<P>
"Too bad they didn't write the race for six furlongs and one jump. Bad luck for 
me and good luck for Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
Warning Zone, the 9-5 favorite, was third, 2 1/2 lengths behind Survive, then 
came the Wayne Lukas pair of Love And Affection and Solid Eight, Josette and 
Polly's Rumor. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Stormy But Valid returned $6.20 as the 2-1 second choice and earned $47,850 for 
her owners. . . . Malibu Stakes winner Music Merci worked seven furlongs in 
1:25 4/5 Saturday morning for trainer Craig Lewis. The Stop The Music gelding 
is readying for a start in the $200,000 San Fernando a week from today. . . . 
Also working Saturday were Candi's Gold and Hawkster. Coming back after a year 
at stud, Candi's Gold went five furlongs in :58 3/5. He'll run in the $100,000 
San Carlos Handicap Saturday. Hawkster, preparing for the Charles H. Strub 
Stakes Feb. 4, worked six furlongs in 1:11 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
Quiet American, who was most impressive in an allowance race last week, will 
bypass the San Fernando and make his next start in the Strub, trainer Gary 
Jones said. . . . Trainer Mike Mollica was fined $400 for a medication 
violation last month at Hollywood Park. Mollica's Polysemous, who won the 
second race Dec. 23, was found to have been given butazolidin in excess of the 
permitted level. . . . Dominant Dancer, who was beaten 20 1/2 lengths in the 
Hollywood Futurity, has had a second blister applied to her troublesome shin 
and should be back in training late next month.

ROGER SIMON: WRAPPING UP GUILT FOR GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He thought the last presents had arrived on New Year's Eve, but they are still 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
"These are guilt presents," he said on the phone. "Somebody gets a Christmas 
present from you for their kid and they didn't send your kid one and so they 
rush out after Christmas and buy one." 
</P>
<P>
"What's that?" I asked. Something in the background was going clank-clank. "Did 
someone get Jonathan tire chains?" 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan is 4. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the greatest thing," he said. "It's a He-Man Laser Sword and it makes 
sounds when you swing it." I heard the clank-clank again. "That's the sounds of 
two swords hitting each other. And it also makes the sounds of cannonballs." I 
heard a whump-whump. "And a laser sound with thunder. And it has lights that go 
off." 
</P>
<P>
I asked if Jonathan liked it. 
</P>
<P>
"Hates it," his father said. "But Rebecca likes it. Why didn't we have stuff 
like this when we were kids?" 
</P>
<P>
"Curmudgeon alert!" I yelled into the phone. 
</P>
<P>
My friend laughed. When we were young writers entering our 20s, we swore that 
we would never become curmudgeons. We swore we would never become like the 
columnists we sometimes read who grumped about what life was like when they 
were kids. 
</P>
<P>
And now that we are young writers with our 20s well behind us, we guard against 
becoming curmudgeons even more carefully. 
</P>
<P>
Unless, of course, we can become like Andy Rooney and make a few million bucks 
a year off it. 
</P>
<P>
"So what did Jonathan like most?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan's parents are still at the stage where they insist that their children 
be called by their full names. Jonathan must be Jonathan and Rebecca must be 
Rebecca. In about six more months I'm going to start calling them Jonny and 
Becky and let their parents sue me. 
</P>
<P>
There was a sigh. "Jonathan likes the giant dominoes," his father said. "They 
are just big blocks of wood. They just sit there. And he loves them." 
</P>
<P>
Go figure. The giant dominoes probably cost about $6. The other presents 
Jonathan got cost many times that and he ignores them. Kids just don't 
appreciate life. 
</P>
<P>
"So how was Christmas at Paul's?" my friend asked. Paul is a mutual friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent the holiday at Paul's," I corrected him. "Not Christmas." There were 
three families at Paul's house. Each had one kid and it was a typical mix: one 
kid was Catholic on both sides, one was Jewish on both sides, and one was 
half-Catholic and half-Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
Not that any of it mattered. The only things being worshiped that day was Toys 
R Us. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the presents took about four hours, until the kids became so 
exhausted ripping off the paper and opening the boxes that they had to stop for 
a break. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest present was a car for Paul's kid, Tommy, that he could ride in. Or 
he could some day. Right now, he was much too small to reach the pedals. "It 
will take him about two years," his mother estimated. 
</P>
<P>
I made the mistake of asking why she didn't get him a car with pedals he could 
reach now. 
</P>
<P>
"Because there are three of those on the block already," she said. "This one 
was different." 
</P>
<P>
Tommy didn't care. He spent the day sitting in his car, protecting it from the 
other kids. Every now and then, he would make a raid on the gift pile, 
snatching one and dragging it back to the safety of his car. 
</P>
<P>
"The day was . . . it was . . . " I was trying to search for the right word, 
the fairest word to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
"Obscene," my friend on the phone said cheerfully. My friend comes from a big 
Irish family and his wife comes from a big Irish family and so the presents 
their kids get at Christmas are measured in tonnage. 
</P>
<P>
"Obscene," my friend repeated. "You watch the kids open presents until they 
become glassy-eyed. They can't even handle all that stuff. It is sensory 
overload. It burns them out. And you sit there and after about three hours, you 
want to gather up all the toys they have opened and forgotten about and just 
take them down to some homeless shelter." 
</P>
<P>
"Ever try it?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, right," he said. "I'd come home and be cut in half by a laser sword." 
</P>
<P>
"Or have a giant domino fall on you," I said. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides," he said, "we are preparing them for adulthood. We are teaching them 
to be good consumers." 
</P>
<P>
"Good point," I said. "But how much of a religious holiday is it for your 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
"Curmudgeon alert!" my friend shouted. "How much of a religious holiday is it 
for you?" 
</P>
<P>
I thought about that. "It's not," I said. "Not anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"So why do you expect children to be different?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
I paused. "Because there's hope for children?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
In the background, I heard a laser sword go clank-clank and whump-whump. 
</P>
<P>
"If you say so," he said.

MISS MANNERS: THE FINE ART OF WISHING ONE WELL

"At long last, I'm in love," confides a radiant friend. "It's everything I've 
ever dreamed of, and more. I've never been so happy in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Which of these is the polite response? 
</P>
<P>
"These things never last." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I don't have anybody." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope it's not you-know-who." 
</P>
<P>
"What's that going to do to your career?" 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose you won't have any time for your friends anymore." 
</P>
<P>
"You just think you're in love." 
</P>
<P>
The answer is an emphatic "None of the above." The correct answer is "How 
wonderful -- I'm so happy for you!" 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Miss Manners is informed, happy announcements are nowadays 
commonly met with gloom. At best, "Congratulations!" has been replaced by "Do 
you know what you're getting into?" An expectant mother reports having her 
joyous news greeted with "How horrible!" 
</P>
<P>
Why is it so difficult to wish others well when something wonderful has 
happened to them? Miss Manners believes that seeing people one cares about 
finding happiness is, in itself, one of life's pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
She notices that the dour responses fall into one of three categories, each of 
them unacceptable in someone who is supposed to be a well-wisher. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is the evaluation of the announcement purely in terms of the 
situation of the hearers. Such people don't take even one moment for 
registering pleasure at another's good fortune, because the only matter of 
interest to them is their own. Apparently they believe that the sum of 
happiness in the world is limited, and if anyone else has any -- even a dear 
friend -- it takes away from their own. The result, if you consider this 
carefully, is a friend who wishes you ill. 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps that person wouldn't grudge your pleasure if it didn't threaten his 
or her own -- but considers that it must. In order for you to be on call 
whenever your friend might happen to need you, your attention undistracted from 
that person's wants, your life should contain no pleasant distractions. Weighed 
against a tiny subtraction from that person's convenience, your greatest 
happiness is nothing. 
</P>
<P>
The second response is that of the sourpuss who doesn't believe in the human 
heart: Love is bound to go wrong; even parenthood is bound to lead to grief. 
Seeing your happiness, this sort of friend feels obligated to attempt to kill 
it just in case it might later die of its own accord. The idea is to attempt to 
ruin your happiness now, to save you possible disillusionment later. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from not being a whole lot of fun, Miss Manners finds this a pitiable 
attitude toward life. But even if this pessimism is based on horrid experience, 
it does not excuse dampening others' happiness with dire predictions. If things 
come to a bad end, there will be time enough to be sad -- injecting sadness 
into happy times does not help. 
</P>
<P>
The third response, all too common in a society largely populated by 
busybodies, is to give advice. Nobody seems to have noticed that this is a 
waste of time. People who are in love are notorious for not listening to the 
advice of others. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that the quality of such advice is generally poor. Granted that 
people don't necessarily know what is best for themselves; they are even less 
likely to know what is best for others. 
</P>
<P>
Even should advice that runs counter to your heart turn out later to be 
correct, it will have been useless and unwelcome. Many a person who has smugly 
shown up to take credit for having predicted a breakup finds even more 
resentment in a friend's unhappiness than when the happiness was intact. No one 
ever resents a friend's having wished him or her well, or having cherished 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
It is perfectly possible to offer condolences when they are required, even if 
one has offered enthusiastic congratulations when that was in order. Miss 
Manners is only disillusioned to discover that more people seem to enjoy doing 
the former than the latter.

ZAN THOMPSON: HOLIDAY PARTY SPAWNS A SAD, LITTLE FISH STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The year is a week old and how many people have you heard say, "Well, the 
holidays were wonderful, of course, but I'm glad it's over." That saddens me, 
Christmas sprite that I am, but I can understand. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, the holidays were wonderful with the ancient music enriching the air in 
cathedrals and supermarkets, the sixth-grade pageant and St. Patrick's 
Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
An unfortunate thing happened at a Christmas party and I won't tell you what 
town it was in, lest you figure out the identity of the hostess. Now that I 
live in the desert, and visit in Los Angeles and surroundings, you'll just have 
to guess. (I am bi-urban, heaven help me.) 
</P>
<P>
The party was one of several given in honor of a visiting guest of some luster, 
and each hostess was trying to make her party the finest, the glitziest, the 
most opulent. 
</P>
<P>
One woman hit upon an idea that must have sounded wonderful when she ran it by 
the florist. 
</P>
<P>
She decided to have tall, clear cylindrical vases, each one artlessly filled 
with sprays of flowers. But how would that be different from every other flower 
arrangement that had greeted the visiting dignitary? 
</P>
<P>
"Ah," she thought, "I will put goldfish in the vases. They will make darting 
streaks in gold through the crystal water and among the green stems." 
</P>
<P>
It is almost unbelievable that someone along the way didn't say, "For heaven's 
sake, there won't be enough oxygen left in the water after the flowers go in." 
</P>
<P>
But no one did, and the hostess listened with glee as her guests were seated at 
tables for eight in the large dining room, each one pointing and smiling and 
exclaiming at the bright fish in the vases. 
</P>
<P>
The awful events of the evening began at a table in a corner of the room. One 
fish began to flop around in the water and run into the sides of the vase. At 
length, he floated to the top of the water, deader than the storied mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
Then it began to happen all over the room. There was scarcely any conversation. 
People just sat and watched the terrible passing of the fish. 
</P>
<P>
This put a pall on the evening that seemed to paralyze the guests. No one did a 
thing until the last fish had floated to the top. One woman said, "My, it takes 
so long." And so it did. 
</P>
<P>
I cannot tell you why someone didn't grab the vases and run for the swimming 
pool, or maybe a bath tub, or at least take the flowers out of the vases. I 
don't really know what else anyone could have done except for what they did. 
They left early. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know what the hostess did. I think she took a long sea voyage. The 
evening will never be forgotten by the people who watched the finny debacle. 
</P>
<P>
All right, here we go into the New Year, eyes shining, cheeks ablaze, full of 
hope and rectitude and those of your resolutions still unbroken after one week. 
</P>
<P>
Have a wonderful 1990.

ALICE KAHN: TAKING A NOVEL BREAK AS HISTORY MARCHES ON BY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICE KAHN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm back. Yeah, baby, I'm back. I'm gonna sing the blues. And maybe ball the 
jack. 
</P>
<P>
I'm back. Me and Fast Eddie Felsen and Alexander Dubcek and John Travolta and 
bad pennies and the flip and monogamy (serial or plain) and democracy. Back. 
</P>
<P>
Three things happened while I was gone. 
</P>
<P>
I wrote a novel. Well, the first draft of one. Not a real novel like real 
novelists write, but an unreal novel about novel reality. As a child of the 
Midwest, I took great offense at people who asked me what I did on my 
"vacation." How dare anyone assume I would take a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
It was a strange, reclusive life -- waking up every morning and forcing myself 
to dream. 
</P>
<P>
I also forced myself to jog just to remember I had some kind of physical 
existence in some kind of real world. My kids would come home from school and 
kick me into the world. "There's nothing to eat in this house." You see, fruit, 
vegetables, bread and milk are food groups, not food. 
</P>
<P>
I bravely wrote on, despite the constant vision of my book jacket blurbs: 
"Shockingly banal! . . . Deep down inside, she's shallow . . . The insight of a 
3-year-old . . . " You try getting anything done with friends like these in 
your own head. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was an earthquake in Northern California. I was there. Me and my 
little girl (who is now 15 and bigger than me) were about to watch the World 
Series on TV. I don't remember this, but she claims that when the room turned 
into a Tilt-a-Whirl, I threw myself on top of her. She managed to get her head 
out from under me and look at the big glass window next to us and calmly say, 
"Shouldn't we get under a table?" 
</P>
<P>
The power went out for 20 hours, and a big red moon rose. I was forcibly 
ejected from my computer. We drove around looking for damage but couldn't find 
any. We avoided the three spots where really bad things happened. We saw those 
on the TV over and over and over. A wise man made a T-shirt that said, "I 
Survived the Media Coverage of the Earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone I ever knew back East called to see if we were OK. And on a day when 
girl gangs were randomly sticking pins in women in New York, someone from there 
called and said, "But aren't you afraid to live in California?" 
</P>
<P>
Funny California things happened. There were tiny tidal waves in swimming pools 
and mini-tsunamis in hot tubs. An endless cavalcade of shrinks appeared on TV 
to talk about Surviving Emotional Aftershocks. Aroma therapists volunteered to 
help victims. I know if my house collapsed, I'd want a good whiff of Wild Musk. 
</P>
<P>
A noted Freudian scholar told me he thought the earthquake was an "internal 
event." When the crowds in the library dove under the tables, he said, his 
first thought was: "They can really sense my anger." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there was a big telethon for earthquake relief. People paid a million 
dollars to get the demented image of Neil Young off the screen. 
</P>
<P>
The third thing that happened while I was gone was that the people of Eastern 
Europe rose up. Each week we were treated to another country demanding freedom. 
If it's Tuesday, it must be Poland. 
</P>
<P>
It had to be the most touching sight on live TV since the days of the civil 
rights movement. A Czech leader spoke at a rally, and he said, "We need people 
of the highest knowledge and morality to lead the new democracy." Could he 
possibly be thinking of the same democracy that brought us Bush, Quayle and the 
famous Teddy K? 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, I kept picturing a lounge singer in a dingy joint on the Baltic 
coast slithering to the microphone, loosening his tie and saying, "Franz Kafka, 
baby, this one's for you," as he burst into a medley of "Danke Schoen," "Born 
Free" and "I've Had the Time of My Life." 
</P>
<P>
To recap: In an historic time, in the midst of a terrifying earthquake, I wrote 
a novel of insignificant proportions. It's a free country.

AS ITS NAME INDICATES, the major attraction of the Los Angeles State and County 
Arboretum is the plant and garden displays. But set off on the edge of a pond 
in a lush, wooded section of the grounds is a collection of romantic structures 
rich with the area's architectural and social history. 
</P>
<P>
It includes a fanciful Queen Anne cottage that "Lucky " Baldwin built for his 
14-year-old bride in 1875 (if it looks familar it is because it has served as 
the setting for television's "Fantasy Island"). There are also a coach barn and 
a traditionally styled adobe, doors open and inviting, evoking Old California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arboretum, located at 301 N. Baldwin Ave., Arcadia, (818) 446-8251, is 
open daily 9 to 4:30. Admission charges vary.

'50S FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
IN KEEPING WITH today's fascination with '50s designs, the San Diego store 
called Boomerang was named for those bent kidney shapes on '50s Formica. Owner 
David Skelley had been collecting "Twilight Zone"-era items for years, with the 
thought of opening a diner, when he decided to start Boomerang instead. 
</P>
<P>
Partner Jeff Spence joined him soon after. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the store, zebra-striped vinyl pulses with '50s fervor, a 
wood-and-leather Eames chair reposes near a sculptural coffee table by Isamu 
Noguchi, and an arsenal of bowling balls with swirling patterns await their 
next roll. Skelley's own Calderish mobiles and abstract paintings are for sale, 
as is '50s-look furniture designed and built by the partners. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are often half what they would be in cities with more demand for '50s 
merchandise. That's why a third of Boomerang's customers come from Los Angeles, 
San Francisco and destinations beyond. "We try to deal in pieces that are 
good-to-excellent in quality, in designs that are either classical or 
outrageous," Skelley says. "Colors are real important, too. You won't find 
olive green or harvest gold in this store." 
</P>
<P>
 Boomerang, 3795 Park Blvd., San Diego, (619) 295-1953.

<TEXT>
<P>
WRITING MAGAZINE articles can give writers fits. You go out and interview 30 
people, fill up a dozen notebooks, have books and magazines scattered all over 
the desk and floor. 
</P>
<P>
Then, when you need a particular fact or quote, you can waste so much time 
looking for it that you just give up and type it up from memory -- and that can 
give your editor fits. 
</P>
<P>
Now with programs like PC-Browse, the search is infinitely easier. PC-Browse is 
an open-ended pop-up program that allows you to leave your current file with a 
keystroke, instantly search another file (or whole directory of files), capture 
a quote and then automatically paste it back in your story, all without leaving 
your original file. Furthermore, since you keep your original file in memory, 
there's no waiting time to store it or reload it. You can instantly bounce back 
and forth between your main file and your search files with just a keystroke. 
Every time you pop it up, PC-Browse returns to where you last left it. You can 
then continue the search or go back to earlier ones (as many as 10). 
</P>
<P>
As a general purpose program, PC-Browse isn't aimed only at writers: Business 
people can use it to call up lists of telephone numbers or addresses. Auto 
parts stores can use it to locate parts numbers to merge them into the invoice. 
</P>
<P>
Other applications suggested by the publisher: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Looking up information when you're doing something else. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Finding a lost memo when all you remember is a word or two from it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cross-referencing your family tree. PC-Browse is a share-ware program 
available for $12 from computer bulletin boards, distribution companies or the 
publisher: Quicksoft, 219 1st Avenue North, 224, Seattle, Wash. 98109; (206) 
282-0452.

COMBATTING THE ROADWAY BLUES

<P>
SOME OF US complain about commuting 25 minutes back and forth to work. Others, 
however, actually like to spend the entire day driving perhaps 200 miles in 
stop-and-go traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Chamichian, a former Los Angeles Police Department officer, drives about 
4,000 miles a month for Beverly Hills-based V.I.P. Limousine. Whether 
chauffeuring rock stars or corporate presidents, he takes a scientific, 
eye-on-the-clock approach to dodging gridlock. We asked him to share his 
time-tested tips: 
</P>
<P>
"Avoid the freeway between 3:30 and 6 p.m.; any of the city's wide surface 
streets are probably faster." 
</P>
<P>
"Beverly Boulevard is the quickest route west from downtown L.A.; Imperial 
Highway is a clear route to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
"To reach LAX at rush hour, get onto Sepulveda Boulevard if you can. From 
Sepulveda, it's a straight shot into the airport, bypassing all freeways and 
Century Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
"To San Diego, Interstate 5 is better than (Interstate) 405." 
</P>
<P>
"Plan your down time and average it in on the total trip time, especially on 
the surface streets. The average time spent at a red light in rush hour is 
about 1 minute and 20 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
"It's fine to listen to the traffic reports on the radio, but remember that 
most of them are 20 minutes behind, and a lot of the accidents have already 
been cleared." JUDITH SIMS

French actress Mathilda May kneels on the promenade deck of the Queen Mary in 
Long Beach, a pink robe draped over her pale shoulders against the late-night 
cold. First-time director Leonard Schrader, also the screenwriter, huddles 
beside her, quietly discussing the scene. The crew relaxes and waits. 
Everyone's surprisingly calm, considering the circumstances. Or maybe they're 
just exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
It's the 101st and final day of filming "Naked Tango," originally scheduled for 
84 shooting days. After 16 turbulent, demanding weeks on location in Argentina 
-- 15-hour work days, six days a week -- production has returned here to wrap 
up. Independent producer David Weisman puts the cost vaguely at "around $10 
million," 16% over initial projections. If this were a big-budget studio 
picture, Schrader readily admits, he might long ago have been yanked from the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
But his producer is the iconoclastic Weisman, who collaborated with 
screenwriter Schrader and director Hector Babenco on "Kiss of the Spider Woman" 
(1985). Shot for $3 million, it earned four Oscar nominations -- a Best Actor 
win for William Hurt -- and grossed nearly $50 million worldwide. Weisman 
subsequently walked away from the prestigious "Ironweed" because of star clout 
and power struggles he figured he couldn't win. 
</P>
<P>
Now, working without a completion bond on "Naked Tango," Weisman says he's 
hardly "cavalier" about escalated costs, but also insists he's comfortable with 
Schrader's meticulous approach. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going for quality," says the short, stocky Weisman, 47, who runs on a 
deep tank of nervous energy. "If it takes longer to light the shot, you take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
As Stephanie, a European bride on her way to Buenos Aires in 1924, the 
23-year-old May wears a satin sheath dress and silver lame turban, the 
trappings of a privileged life with which she's grown bored and restless. The 
scene calls for her to glance down to the dark water, where a suicidal young 
woman has just plunged to her death, then back to the woman's shoes, left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
It's a near-mystical moment in Stephanie's life that helps set the story in 
motion: almost as a lark, she switches identities with the dead woman, only to 
be thrust into bondage to a bordello, deadly violence and a passion for love 
and life she never imagined possible. 
</P>
<P>
Through five previous takes, Schrader has been searching for various moods -- 
"like different clouds passing across her face," as he later puts it. He waits 
for a noisy party boat to pass in the harbor, then gets what he needs on the 
sixth take. Cast and crew grab a quick meal break before returning to work 
until dawn. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she can characterize Schrader's approach as a director with one word, 
May answers, "Patience -- it was the most important thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw him get angry or screaming. He may have gotten angry, but with us 
actors he was very gentle, very kind." 
</P>
<P>
At 46, Leonard Schrader is the graying, older brother of film maker Paul 
Schrader (co-writer of "Taxi Driver," writer-director of "Hardcore," and 
"American Gigolo"), whose repressive Calvinist upbringing has often been 
discussed in connection with his films. They characteristically explore 
violence, temptation, sexual obsession, the primal underbelly beneath the 
veneer of civilized society . 
</P>
<P>
Raised in the same rigidly moralistic environment, Leonard Schrader has become 
known as a screenwriter who also deals in dark, complex subject matter; "The 
Yakuza," "Mishima," "Kiss of the Spider Woman" are among his credits and 
co-credits. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in his directorial debut, Leonard Schrader is taking on his biggest 
challenge with "Naked Tango." 
</P>
<P>
It's a highly stylized period piece set against the lurid Jewish underworld of 
1924 Buenos Aires. Most of his shooting -- on 37 separate locations -- has 
taken place in a foreign country aswirl with social and economic chaos. His 
lead actors are near unknowns, with limited film experience. In the script, the 
abuse and degradation of some women characters is unrelenting, the love play 
often perverse. There's no clear-cut hero to root for, no storybook ending. 
</P>
<P>
It's the kind of material -- "Last Tango in Paris," "The Night Porter," "Blue 
Velvet," "Querelle" also come to mind -- that can cause devoted admiration or 
utter disdain. 
</P>
<P>
Currently busy in the editing room (the film wrapped Nov. 7), Schrader may be 
putting together his breakthrough film -- or his directorial Titanic. And he 
knows it. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm not taking some chances, I run out of energy, I get bored to death," he 
says. "And if you're successful, you've got something no other film has." 
</P>
<P>
Intense and intellectual, Schrader surprises the reporter with a jolly laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always enjoyed doing things that people say aren't possible."

"Naked Tango" began gestating in 1983, when Weisman was meeting with 
novelist-playwright Manuel Puig about the adaptation of the author's "Kiss of 
the Spider Woman" for the screen. Puig was insistent that Tango -- the sensual 
dance that originated among the pimps and prostitutes of Buenos Aires at the 
turn of the century, later becoming the rage of Paris -- would soon blossom 
again as a cultural phenomenon. By 1986, "Tango Argentino" was a hot ticket on 
Broadway, "Tango Apasionado" was successful off-Broadway, and Tango was making 
a ripple in a few dance clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Schrader, meanwhile, had long wanted to explore the concept that romantic love, 
as practiced in an overly civilized culture, impedes the potential for and the 
fulfillment of a deeper, more profound love. In Puig's descriptions of the 
shadowy, fervent underworld of the 1920s Argentine bordellos -- with Tango its 
dangerous dance of love and death -- Schrader found his backdrop and metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, the essence of romance, for all its high-octane fuel, is for romance 
to burn itself out," Schrader explains, chain smoking and drinking coffee in 
Weisman's exotic home/film making compound just off the fashionable section of 
Melrose Avenue. "In the ashes of romance can grow a more mature, a different 
kind of love. The more chance you have to take romance all the way to the end, 
the more chance you have to be ready for the next phase. Most of us only have 
the courage to take it halfway." 
</P>
<P>
By loving timidly, safely, with restraint, Schrader feels, we fail to 
experience a truly transcendent passion. By fearing risk and death, we 
experience only half-lived lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Most romances keep the element of death hidden under the table," he adds. "I 
wanted to put it square in the middle of the table." 
</P>
<P>
He began writing a script with William Hurt in mind to play Cholo, a murderous 
hoodlum and street Tango master who "uses his sex drive as a means of achieving 
transcendence -- he takes it to the highest point possible, but doesn't release 
it." The Tango is Cholo's artistic tool, an unconscious means of expressing his 
deepest self. "He can't articulate it, but he's found an art form, and he needs 
a partner." 
</P>
<P>
In Schrader's script, the beautiful Stephanie abandons her wealthy, older 
husband -- paternal Judge Torres (Fernando Rey) -- and takes the place of Alba, 
the shipboard suicide. As a Polish mail-order bride, Stephanie/Alba begins life 
with charming Zico (Esai Morales), who quickly proves sinister, enslaving Alba 
in the elegant bordello over which his domineering mother presides. When Alba 
resists, he attempts to kill her, but falters -- and the sleek, menacing Cholo 
steps in. 
</P>
<P>
"His radar picks up that she's different from the other women he's known, which 
is bordello women. Like him, she's looking for something. He senses a partner 
of emotion, of attitude, a fellow artist. He's found a tango partner." 
</P>
<P>
Alba becomes Cholo's possession. As he teaches her the Tango, in which the man 
controls the woman's every move, she awaits the chance to kill him. But she 
also begins to experience passion for the first time, as Cholo pushes her to 
the edge with him, hoping to inflame her cold spirit and meld their souls. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in 1987, with Hurt committed to star, the screenplay attracted 
generous bids from numerous studios, according to Weisman. Opting to retain 
creative control, he and Schrader secured half the financing from Toho-Tawa 
Co., Ltd., Japan's biggest film company, and the rest from a mix of investors, 
including Swiss. 
</P>
<P>
When Hurt dropped out last year to deal with personal problems -- including the 
much-publicized "palimony" trial that ended in his favor last year -- Weisman 
and Schrader spent the rest of 1988 searching for Alba and Cholo in Los 
Angeles, New York, London and Paris. 
</P>
<P>
After ten months, they found Cholo: Vincent D'Onofrio, a somewhat brooding, 
introspective New York actor who up to that time had been visible primarily in 
Stanley Kubrick's "Full Metal Jacket" (see accompanying story). 
</P>
<P>
"His presence was riveting," recalls Weisman of their first meeting. "His take 
on the part was unmistakable." 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to cast Cholo from the inside, not the outside," Schrader adds. "I 
wanted an artist who is already struggling with (Cholo's own issues), who 
brings that to the table with him. We met some actors who looked more like 
Cholo, but who didn't carry Cholo inside of them." 
</P>
<P>
D'Onofrio, who had never danced formally, began Tango lessons in New York a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Around the same time, the producer and director met Mathilda May in Paris. A 
ballerina who speaks excellent English, she shot to prominence last year in 
director Claude Chabrol's "Cry of the Owl," for which she won a Cesar, the 
French equivalent of the Oscar. She was also young, affordable, with an 
attractive blend of sophistication and freshness. 
</P>
<P>
"The list (of her qualities) goes on and on," Schrader says. "I felt it was 
almost a miracle that we found someone who was all of these things." 
</P>
<P>
Morales, previously typecast in tough-guy Latino roles -- he portrayed Richie 
Valens' hard-drinking brother in "La Bamba" -- had wanted desperately to 
portray Cholo. 
</P>
<P>
"No question about it," Morales says. "I've been waiting years for a part I 
felt right for. There's this stereotype that if you're dark, you're dirty. Here 
was a character of passion, ethnic, and the romantic lead. Also, I'm a natural 
dancer -- I get off dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Morales was cast as the weak, perverse Zico, a Polish Jew who runs a 
whorehouse and uses Alba as his sexual slave. "The guy who makes the lead look 
good, the pimp. It's back to the second position again. I didn't want to do it 
for the longest time." 
</P>
<P>
He finally accepted the role, he says, because of the quality of the script -- 
"It hits you on a gut level" -- and the complexity of the character. Schrader, 
says Morales, sold him on the importance of Zico, who "represents the world in 
an archetypal sense. Zico envies the freedom that Cholo has but lives a life 
bound to the expectations of his own mother." 
</P>
<P>
With high production values a priority, Weisman also signed English production 
designer Anthony Pratt ("Excalibur," "Hope and Glory") and Spanish director of 
photography Juan Ruiz Anchia ("At Close Range," "House of Games"). Debra 
McDermott ("Amadeus") is editing. 
</P>
<P>
Filming began outdoors in Buenos Aires the morning of June 21. 
</P>
<P>
It rained. 
</P>
<P>
"Gruelling" is how Schrader summarizes the Argentine shoot. 
</P>
<P>
The production arrived shortly after a presidential election, amid food riots, 
gas rationing, wildly fluctuating exchange rates. The principal location, 
renovated to double as the bordello, was three levels below ground in a 
decaying, turn-of-the-century galleria -- "extremely oppressive," Weisman says. 
Illness was prevalent, time off almost non-existent. 
</P>
<P>
The winter conditions didn't help, Schrader adds. "Viral infections, colds, 
food poisoning, no rest. You're working with a raging fever, rubbery legs, 
vomiting every three hours, trying to keep your head clear. You're constantly 
fighting the temptation to say, 'I'll just try to avoid making mistakes,' 
instead of reaching higher. 
</P>
<P>
"All of that made it (filming) murder. But everyone seemed to feel we were 
doing something worthwhile. Everyone seemed to get energy from that. We had a 
few people drop along the way, but we had some tremendous people stay to the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
Spiraling costs (including bribes) and production delays forced Schrader to 
"cut two or three shots every day, one scene a week at least." 
</P>
<P>
"We lived on the edge of expecting catastrophe any minute," remembers Weisman. 
"And it just never happened. I'm amazed we got out with the negative." 
</P>
<P>
D'Onofrio, alluding to a fateful Tango between the characters of Cholo and 
Judge Torres -- men often practiced the Tango together during its heyday -- was 
more philosophical about the Argentine shoot. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a great experience," he says, grinning. "When else do you get the 
chance to dance with Fernando Rey in a movie?" 
</P>
<P>
Though Schrader's script is rife with nudity and graphic sex -- May says she 
was "very shocked" when she first read it -- Schrader says the film was staged, 
lit and framed to leave much to the viewer's imagination. It will be cut 
similarly. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no intention of making an X-rated film. I never did. I like to address 
the eye that sees your dreams, the mind's eye. I've found that, paradoxically, 
the less you show the physical eye, the greater impact you have. 
</P>
<P>
"My original intention was to write the most erotic story I could without a 
single sex scene in it. So the dancing was the (metaphor) for sex. (But) 
eroticism is very definitely one of the forms of energy I'm using to make this 
story move." 
</P>
<P>
The movie's title refers not to literal nakedness, Schrader says, but to 
partners baring their souls. 
</P>
<P>
However tasteful the final cuts, the film's content is sure to stir comment. At 
least at surface level, the story is about a woman falling in love with her 
captor, her abuser. Schrader hopes he's creating a piece of art -- deliberately 
disturbing art -- that will carry viewers beyond that perception, which he sees 
as simplistic. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, Alba has two choices. She can choose to live with Torres, who will 
(provide) a long life of comfort and security but emotional death, with a 
frozen heart. Or with Cholo, who offers more passion, more intensity, than she 
ever dreamed of, but where she can die any minute. He wants a woman who will 
fight back, who will be who she wants to be . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Like life, Cholo is a very paradoxical figure. Life abuses and nurtures us. 
Torres turns off life, which is a much worse form of abuse." 
</P>
<P>
Directing, like writing, has become Schrader's own dark Tango. For the moment, 
it's danced precariously in the editing room, where false moves can be 
disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
"This is why I love it -- every choice, every step, every moment is crucial," 
he says. "I love to be in that position, where I can win or lose, because it 
means that what I'm doing counts." 
</P>

<P>
It is the final night of the Margaret Jenkins Dance Company's three-city tour 
to the Soviet Union, and dancer Anne Krauss is evoking the still grandeur of 
America's Southwest in the concluding section of "Rollback." As Terry Allen's 
throbbing country score fades to silence, Krauss walks in a leisurely circle 
around the perimeter of the stage, conjuring images of light and of water with 
her gently rolling hands. 
</P>
<P>
In the 500- to 1,000-seat American and European theaters where Jenkins 
customarily performs contemporary dance, this moment creates a charged and 
intensely quiet atmosphere. But here, at the 4,000-seat Oktiabrskii (October) 
Hall, the massive Soviet crowd grows restless. One particularly disruptive chap 
is clapping loudly. What to do? 
</P>
<P>
In a blink, Krauss stops, gazes hard in the direction of the miscreant and puts 
her index finger to her lips the way an elementary school teacher does when 
things get out of hand. The huge throng is strangely becalmed. Finishing her 
solo without further disturbance in the slightest, she and the other three 
American dancers receive one of their biggest ovations of the Russian tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved that she did that," exclaimed Nikita Delgushin, director of the 
choreographic faculty at Leningrad's Rimsky-Korsakov Conservatory, immediately 
after the performance. "Our people cannot see movement without music. In this 
sense, our audience is not ready to appreciate this performance. We have to 
teach them." 
</P>
<P>
Exposing Soviet audiences to the aesthetics of modern dance -- a genre as 
ethnically American as ballet is Russian -- was one of the major purposes of a 
recent and remarkable double tour by San Francisco's most prominent modern 
dance groups, the Margaret Jenkins Dance Company and Brenda Way's ODC/San 
Francisco. Under separate sponsorship and with schedules that, according to 
company representatives, overlapped only by coincidence, the nearly sold-out 
visits were the first by any American modern troupe since Paul Taylor's 
four-city U.S. State Department tour in 1978 and Trisha Brown's breeze through 
Moscow last February. 
</P>
<P>
Both companies were interested in raising big questions on their trips to the 
Soviet Union in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Can the work that we're bringing get past the proscenium? Can it infiltrate 
and resonate with a Soviet audience?" Jenkins says she wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
"Which part of the human spirit do we connect at? And what is recognizably 
American about us?" Way asked. 
</P>
<P>
Before such questions could even be articulated, let alone addressed, however, 
the Americans' relationship with the Soviets got off to some fairly serious, if 
humorous, missteps. 
</P>
<P>
For ODC/San Francisco -- whose self-initiated trip was sponsored by the 
Theatrical Workers Union of the Russian Republic -- the difficulties began in 
Frunze, deep in Central Asia, where local presenters booked the company into an 
ungainly 4,000-seat sports pavilion and advertised the engagement with a banner 
that read (in Russian) "Beauties From San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a rock 'n' roll concert that first night," says Linc King, the 
company's executive director. "There were catcalls from the back of the hall -- 
'Where are the beauties? Where are the beauties?' -- and people walking all 
over backstage. We had to post guards." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins, whose trip was planned by the San Francisco-based Soviet-American 
Performing Arts Exchange and sponsored by Orfei, an independent Leningrad 
agency that usually presents rock groups and art exhibits, had a comparatively 
luxurious and 
</P>
<P>
smooth-running tour. Still, it was fraught with intercultural gaffes and 
miscommunications. 
</P>
<P>
On the afternoon of the company's dress rehearsal in Moscow, for instance, 
Orfei's representative casually asked Jenkins if some people could come and 
watch. She assented. Imagine the choreographer's surprise, though, when, at 7 
o'clock, 500 prominent Muscovites turned up, dressed to kill. 
</P>
<P>
"All the press was there and old ballerinas from the Bolshoi and the Kirov," 
said Jenkins, who had been planning a necessary stop-and-go technical rehearsal 
and who was unprepared to stage a full performance. When all but 20 of the most 
interested viewers left, clearly disgruntled, the embarrassed representative 
could only say: "Well, we just have a very different idea about what an open 
rehearsal is." 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, the American companies and Soviet audiences had very different 
ideas about dancing too. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the biggest point of contention between the San Francisco modern 
dance companies and the Soviet, predominantly ballet-oriented audience was the 
question of what constitutes an appropriate body for theatrical dance. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got a good toe," whispered Mariana Bogalovskaia, a former soloist with 
the Bolshoi Ballet, noting Jenkins dancer Ellie Klopp's exceptional 
crescent-shaped feet during the first Moscow performance. "You have to select 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
But the evaluations could also be withering. "They look like body-builders," 
complained Lara Berovkova, referring to ODC's exceptionally strong female 
dancers. "Their dancing looks more like sport than art." 
</P>
<P>
"I understand that Americans have another aesthetic of the body," explained 
Moscow independent choreographer Alla Sigalova, who visited Boston recently on 
an exchange with Emerson College. "But we are accustomed to the classic forms. 
I like everything in my life to be beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Other audience members were struck more by the new movement qualities they were 
seeing than with the presence or absence of physical endowments. Olga Petrik, a 
teacher of Portuguese language at a local college in Moscow, said she was 
enthralled by the variety of body types in ODC's performance. "The short one, 
she would never be able to dance here," Petrik said, referring to the dynamic, 
though diminutive, Lizanne McAdams. "But she is very expressive." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, an aspiring young actress returned each evening to Moscow's 
Stanislavsky Theater to see the Jenkins group perform, saying, with the 
passionate conviction of one of America's own early modern dancers: "It doesn't 
matter what your body is like, but how you move." 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Jenkins brought the debate to a head by performing her nude 
solo "Steps Midway" almost every night on tour. Set against an arc of wavy 
fun-house mirrors -- "a metaphor," she says, "for the way we distort reality" 
-- the choreography for "Steps" was originally conceived as an intimate 
personal investigation. On opening night in Moscow -- amidst loud chatter and 
the flashing of cameras -- it seemed more like a public circus. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely thought that being nude would lead the audience to ask the 
question, 'Why?' " Jenkins said, after the last performance was over. "But I 
was very surprised by the nervous response." 
</P>
<P>
Choreographically, Way was struck by the Soviets' "lack of receptivity to 
visual abstraction. . . . They couldn't see movement exploration for what it 
was," she said, struggling to understand how her work looked from this new 
audience's perspective. "It reminded me of when I went to Greece, and at first 
I couldn't hear the language, I couldn't hear the ends of sentences. . . . 
These were new movement possibilities for them, a new realm." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than being swept away by pure movement, Way said, audiences gravitated 
to narratively inspired choreography such as her "Loose the Thread," based 
loosely on the lives of members of Virginia Woolf's Bloomsbury Group -- even 
though, according to Petrik, "Virginia Woolf is familiar because of the title 
of Edward Albee's play (but) her books are unavailable in translation." 
</P>
<P>
At times in "Loose," the message was conveyed almost too well. A homoerotic 
duet danced by Ney Fonseca and Jeff Friedman sent a few audience members in 
each of ODC's four tour cities bolting for the door. 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins faced defections too, but for a different reason and with a different 
kind of dance: "Georgia Stone," the featured work on her Soviet tour. An 
anti-war piece set to a tape collage by Yoko Ono (who turned up unexpectedly at 
the final performance in Moscow), "Georgia" was chosen by Jenkins because of 
what she perceived as its stunning applicability "at this point in Soviet 
history, when glasnost is posing questions such as 'How open can things get? 
How much can we let everybody know about what's going on in the world?' " 
</P>
<P>
At its American premiere at Zellerbach Hall in Berkeley, the piece won a 
sustained standing ovation. In the U.S.S.R., however, "Georgia" was just 
reaching its peak when a sizeable nightly exodus occurred. (It's the moment 
when Jenkins' six white-clad dancers stop in their tracks to listen to a child 
in Ono's score crying, "Mommy, Mommy, get me out of here!") How come? Leningrad 
actress Tanya Kysovkina's explanation speaks volumes about the present economic 
and social situation in the U.S.S.R. "We have so many of our own problems in 
the Soviet Union that we don't want to think about others," she said. "We're 
not bad people. We just want to eat." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Jenkins' "Miss Jacobi Weeps," a love duet performed by Klopp and 
Jesse Traschen, was a big hit. At one performance, bouquets of flowers were 
thrown to the stage. As Jenkins explains, "It's the closest thing to a pas de 
deux." 
</P>
<P>
Both Way's and Jenkins' communicative intentions came closest to realization in 
the Baltic Republics, where the independence movement is currently in full 
swing. In Vilnius, where the Opera House audience was warm, though 
noncommittal, Jenkins had a measurably stronger response for "Georgia" than in 
Moscow or Leningrad. The audience members, many of whom were standing or 
sitting in the orchestra pit, stayed right through to the end. 
</P>
<P>
Performing in Riga, the capital city of the neighboring Latvian republic on 
national Freedom Day, the nine members of ODC experienced their most palpable 
audience connection of the whole tour, in part because of some savvy 
last-minute packaging. In addition to dedicating the performance to the 
specifically Latvian holiday, Way rechoreographed the end of her "Second Wind" 
-- a dance that celebrates personal freedom -- so that dancer K.T. Nelson would 
strike the pose of the city's "Liberty Lady" statue, holding a lighted candle 
in her hand. "They did sort of storm the stage after that," Way said, 
underplaying the crowd's rousing ovation and the fountain of flowers that 
filled the stage. 
</P>
<P>
Having traversed thousands of miles, performed for up to 30,000 people (as many 
as either company normally reaches in a year), and survived the perils of false 
advertising, precarious travel arrangements and more than one misunderstanding 
with a tour sponsor, do the two West Coast choreographers feel that the trip 
was worth it? Do Soviet audiences know any more about modern dance than they 
did before? 
</P>
<P>
"From my perspective, anything that brings with it as much complexity as this 
did was an unmitigated success," Way said. "It's like relationships. The ones 
that matter are the complicated ones." 
</P>
<P>
Says Jenkins, whose Russian-Jewish heritage made the trip particularly 
significant: "Being one of the first since glasnost to come -- and have major 
questions be posed about what the nature is of art -- isn't something that 
happens at summer camp. We go to the Kennedy Center and we're being compared to 
the 20-some companies that have passed through over the last four or five 
years. There is virtually no comparison in the Soviet Union, which is a very 
refreshing experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more strongly than ever what John Cage said about art being beyond 
likes and dislikes. The point is the two or three people who are going to think 
differently about something for the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw Merce (Cunningham)'s company in 1963, it changed my life, because I 
was ready to have the questions that he asked. I think there are enough people 
out there starving for some questions."

Bill Bushnell's Los Angeles Theatre Center has become, in two important ways, 
the Los Angeles theater center. 
</P>
<P>
No other theater is more in tune with the multicultural quality of emerging Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
With its array of ethnic labs and its consistent production of plays by Latinos 
and blacks, as well as its international imports, LATC is the most 
heterogeneous theater in town. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it's the most prolific theater in the area -- offering more fully 
staged productions per year (16 in 1988, 14 in 1989) than the Mark Taper Forum 
(11 in 1988, 10 in 1989) or South Coast Repertory (12 in 1988, 13 in 1989). 
Though Bushnell's taste certainly hasn't proven infallible, more than 233,000 
paying theatergoers (plus 10,000 students) saw shows at LATC's rejuvenated bank 
building on downtown's Spring Street during the last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
As the new decade begins, Bushnell will be able to concentrate on artistic 
direction more exclusively than before. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than running the entire theater, he is now one of three supposedly equal 
administrators, and new managing director Robert N. Lear is taking over many of 
the fund-raising and housekeeping responsibilities that have occupied Bushnell 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Although LATC is still in its perpetual financial crisis, the board is taking 
steps to shore up its $7.3 million budget. These efforts may result in less 
money -- but more time -- for Bushnell to flex his creative muscles in the 
'90s. DON SHIRLEY

<P>
When Esa-Pekka Salonen arrives on the job in 1992 as director of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic, he should have more than just the usual ex officio 
influence on local music-making. 
</P>
<P>
Salonen will lead the orchestra into the Music Center's new Disney Hall. 
</P>
<P>
If the recent experience of the Orange County Performing Arts Center is any 
indication, the new building will focus attention on its residents and bring 
them new audiences of the trendy and simply curious, at least for the first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra is counting on the earnest young Finn to provide charismatic 
leadership and enticing programs to rejuvenate audiences without alienating the 
graying Philharmonic faithful. Salonen comes to the orchestra as a composer as 
well as a conductor at a time when premieres are becoming assets again, rather 
than liabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important, Salonen may be the music director who survives Ernest 
Fleischmann. The demanding and productive executive vice president of the 
Philharmonic will be 70 when Salonen's first contract expires, and for obvious 
reasons the words retirement and Fleischmann are now being linked in Music 
Center speculation. For the first time in almost a generation, the music 
director will be the unquestioned apex of Philharmonic leadership, and that 
music director will most likely be Salonen. JOHN HENKEN

CLAUDIO ABBADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Herbert von Karajan may be dead, but the cornerstones of his musical empire are 
intact and have fallen into the hands of 56-year-old conductor Claudio Abbado. 
</P>
<P>
The next decade will see if another Generalmusikdirektor for Europe is in the 
making. 
</P>
<P>
As something of a dark-horse candidate, Abbado last October succeeded Karajan 
as chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic -- only the fifth in the 107-year 
history of the orchestra. He was already music director of the Vienna State 
Opera, a post once Karajan's and one which Abbado intends to hold 
simultaneously with Berlin. He was previously music director of La Scala (as 
was Karajan) and chief conductor of the London Symphony (Karajan had led 
London's Philharmonia Orchestra). 
</P>
<P>
There the similarities may end. By all accounts, Abbado is a quiet, private 
person and patient in rehearsal. He has championed new music and liberal causes 
-- a close friend of Italian Communists such as composer Luigi Nono, Abbado has 
publicly campaigned against Italian fascists and taken the La Scalaorchestra 
out to factories for inexpensive concerts. 
</P>
<P>
It is unlikely that Abbado will -- or would want to -- lead the Berliners and 
Viennese down avant-garde paths, but musicians who had spurned association with 
Karajan because of his previous Nazi ties -- or whom Karajan had barred -- may 
return to the Central European fold. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was the principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony for three 
years and reportedly had agreed to take over the New York Philharmonic before 
he was offered the Berlin position, Abbado is largely known in this country -- 
particularly on the West Coast -- through recordings. His discography lists 
well over 100 recordings, most on Deutsche Grammophon, and most of standard 
Germanocentric symphonic fare and Italian opera. John Henken

Los Angeles-born Jon Robin Baitz, 28, has been someone to watch since his first 
play "Mizlansky-Zilinsky" was produced by L.A. Theatre Works in January, 1985. 
Next came "The Film Society," a strong play about the British presence in South 
Africa, which traveled from the Los Angeles Theatre Center to London, New York 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Writing in London's Plays and Players magazine, Charles Marowitz called the 
play "as auspicious" a premiere as John Osborne's "Look Back in Anger" or 
Harold Pinter's "The Birthday Party." 
</P>
<P>
Much as "Mizlansky-Zilinsky" drew on Baitz's experiences working for a 
Hollywood producer, both "The Film Society" and his next play, "Dutch 
Landscape," were set in South Africa, where he spent much of his childhood. 
Although "Dutch Landscape's" premiere last season at the Taper was skewered by 
the press, the playwright had four more commissions going when its run ended in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Baitz has accelerated his pace and broadened his subject matter. 
This year alone, the bicoastal writer sent off for production one play about an 
expatriate British psychiatrist, another about a Holocaust survivor-turned-bon 
vivant and the screenplay for a romantic psychological thriller -- plus 
finished most of a novel. Wrote New York magazine drama critic John Simon last 
year: "Though it's riskier to gamble on writers' futures than on pork bellies, 
I would invest in Jon Robin Baitz." BARBARA ISENBERG

CLAUDIO ABBADO LEADS A RUSH TO RECORD ROSSINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN ULRICH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rossini is the composer dominating the new opera releases this season. It's a 
moot point whether we live in an era that has fostered the pinpoint vocal 
technique and authority necessary to plumb the treasures lying in wait amid 
Rossini's 38 stage works. But scholarship at last has turned its furrowed brow 
to an artist far too long perceived only as an engaging trickster. 
</P>
<P>
No name appears more frequently on new Rossini releases than that of the 
Fondazione Rossini, the Italian-based organization that is gradually publishing 
critical editions of all the operas. One musician who has consistently availed 
himself of these endeavors is Claudio Abbado. The Berlin Philharmonic's 
recently appointed principal conductor is both sonically and musically the 
center of the new recording of "L'Italiana in Algeri" (Deutsche Grammophon 427 
331-2, two compact discs). 
</P>
<P>
Based on the late Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's Vienna State Opera production of the 
durable comedy, the project finds Abbado leading the Vienna Philharmonic in a 
tightly controlled, dominating reading that makes up in detailed phrasing what 
it lacks in sheer affability. Seemingly spun from a plot concocted while 
waiting for the pasta to cook, "L'Italiana" abounds in pyrotechnical displays 
and delectably intricate ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
Greek mezzo-soprano Agnes Baltsa musters the necessary bravura for Isabella, 
though she sounds a bit hard-pressed at times by Abbado's rigid tempos, a 
qualification that extends to the elegant Lindoro of tenor Frank Lopardo. As 
Mustafa, Isabella's comic nemesis, bass Ruggero Raimondi offers uncentered tone 
and lagging rhythmic attacks, thereby thwarting much of the humor in Rossini's 
vocal line. 
</P>
<P>
Based also on a live production (in Lyon, 1988) is Philips' enchanting new "Le 
Comte Ory" (422 406-2, two compact discs). Rossini's only French-language 
comedy borrows heavily from that earlier jape, "Il Viaggio a Reims," but this 
comparatively late work proves a sophisticated, almost Boccaccian comedy of 
sexual manners. 
</P>
<P>
John Eliot Gardiner, the Opera de Lyon's departing music director, has wisely 
enforced ensemble values over individual star turns. One notes with pleasure 
tenor John Aler's flexible Ory, soprano Sumi Jo's pristine Countess Adele, 
mezzo Diana Montague's lovestruck page, Isolier, and baritone Gino Quilico's 
wise tutor Raimbaud. This is the first domestically released stereo recording 
of "Le Comte Ory"; it should provide its own revelations. 
</P>
<P>
One conductor who would have none of critical editions was the late Giuseppe 
Patane, and his complacent baton sanctions most of the traditional buffo shtick 
and vocal assignments on the new "Barbiere di Siviglia" (London 425 520-2, 
three compact discs), with the Orchestra and Chorus of Bologna's Teatro 
Comunale. If nothing else, the recording serves as an introduction to Cecilia 
Bartoli, the remarkable Italian mezzo-coloratura who augurs to become the 
leading Rossini heroine of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Bartoli's Rosina is aristocratic charm personified, a melding of wistfulness 
and calculation, and she finds apt colleagues in William Matteuzzi's elegant 
Almaviva, Leo Nucci's mercurial Figaro and Enrico Fissore's commanding Bartolo. 
Only Paata Burchuladze's ponderous Basilio lets the team down. 
</P>
<P>
Listeners desirous of skipping the preliminaries should head right for 
Bartoli's remarkable debut recital of eight Rossini arias (London 425 430), 
again with Patane, this time conducting the Arnold-Schoenberg-Chor und 
Konzertvereinigung Wiener Volksopernorchester. At the age of 23, Bartoli's 
voice is a remarkably ripe instrument, marked by a sound chest register, a 
secure top, no audible break in registers, flexibility in coloratura passages, 
a hint of covered tone and a pronounced vibrato that will recall the doyenne of 
Rossini specialists, the Spanish star Conchita Supervia. 
</P>
<P>
Bartoli here assays arias from "I'Italiana," "La Donna del Lago," "Tancredi," 
"Otello," "La Pietra del Paragone" and the finale from "La Cenerentola." The 
only miscalculation is the bouncy "Fac ut portem" from the "Stabat Mater," a 
religious masterwork which is not about bounce. 
</P>
<P>
Proof that technique and idiomatic savvy do not alone suffice for Rossini comes 
in often painful guise on a new "Encore" recital by Rockwell Blake (Arabesque 
Z6612, with the London Symphony and Ambrosian Choir conducted by Maximiano 
Valdes). The American tenor fearlessly confronts excerpts from "Semiramide," 
"Zelmira," "Ermione," "La Gazza Ladra," "Otello," "Ricciardo e Zoraide" and 
"Armida." Hearing him leap octaves while elucidating runs with pristine clarity 
fills one with admiration. 
</P>
<P>
It's much harder, however, to love Blake's ungainly attacks and bullish 
assaults on stratospheric passages. Technique and critical editions have their 
place in any Rossini revival, but sheer beauty counts too.

A great believer in the jazz tradition, Marcus Roberts may be one of the best 
bets for its survival through the next decade. His work as pianist and 
orchestrator for Wynton Marsalis has revealed a deep commitment to the 
mainstream values of harmonic improvisation, melodic creativity and rhythmic 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
As an improviser, Roberts finds inspiration in the musical conceptualizing of 
Duke Ellington, the disjunct rhythms and off-beat harmonies of Thelonious Monk 
and the spirituality of John Coltrane -- not a bad combination of influences. 
</P>
<P>
His soloing -- best typified on his Novus recording "The Truth Is Spoken Here" 
-- flows easily from the familiarity of the blues to the eccentricities of the 
avant-garde. And it is part of Roberts' considerable skill that he manages to 
do so in completely seamless fashion, connecting the past to the present 
without the trace of a misstep. DON HECKMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Delfeayo Marsalis is a name that has appeared on a substantial number of record 
labels during the past five years, yet the credit line never listed him in the 
capacity that may yet establish his fame -- as a trombone player. 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis has produced albums for his father Ellis and his brother Branford, as 
well for Harry Connick Jr., the quintet of Donald Harrison and Terence 
Blanchard, and the Polish piano wizard Adam Makowicz. 
</P>
<P>
Among all these albums, he was never heard playing a note, though those who 
have heard him are aware that he may well emerge as the outstanding new 
trombonist of the decade to come. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the delay is that during his six years as a student at 
Berklee College of Music in Boston, Delfeayo Marsalis spent the first half of 
that period studying record production. It was only later that he began to take 
up the trombone seriously, with several Berklee teachers as his guide but with 
the records of J.J. Johnson (the so-called father of bebop trombone) as his 
spiritual mentor. 
</P>
<P>
Graduating from Berklee last spring, Marsalis was heard on a few gigs, then 
moved back to the family home town of New Orleans, where he wants to continue 
working seriously on perfecting his craft as an instrumentalist. Recently, 
calling from New Orleans, he stated that he plans to organize his own group 
next April. Dedicated, intensely creative yet easygoing, Marsalis at 24 seems 
to have no obstacle in his path en route to a brilliant future. LEONARD FEATHER

The youthful Los Angeles keyboardist Billy Childs is well on his way to 
creating a singular voice in jazz as an instrumentalist and improviser, as a 
composer and as a bandleader -- just as his chief influence, Herbie Hancock, 
did early in his career. Classically trained, Childs couples formidable 
technique with musical situations that challenge him, resulting in a player who 
grows and grows. 
</P>
<P>
"Twilight Is Upon Us," Childs' second Windham Hill Jazz release, is replete 
with thought-filled, exciting modern music that reaches for the future yet 
remembers jazz's noble, swinging past. Already widely respected locally and 
nationally among his peers -- he's played with Freddie Hubbard, Gerry Mulligan, 
J.J. Johnson and Branford Marsalis -- Childs should establish an international 
reputation in the next decade. ZAN STEWART

MUSEUM SHOWS PUT ON THEIR TRAVELING SHOES;

SOME MAJOR EXHIBITIONS TAKE TO THE ROAD BUT BYPASS OUR FREEWAYS

Sated as we are by reviews of the past year and decade, it's a relief to look 
ahead in 1990. Forget about the disappointments of 1989. Here come big 
exhibitions of art by Francis Bacon, John Baldessari, Kasimir Malevich, Henri 
Matisse, Claude Monet and Titian. The Soviets are sending more loan shows from 
their great museums, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is organizing a 
landmark exhibition on "The Fauve Landscape" and the J. Paul Getty Museum is 
planning a special show of ancient Cypriot art. 
</P>
<P>
In short, 1990 offers a typically impressive slate of celebrated names and 
ambitious projects -- particularly if you take a coast-to-coast view of 
exhibition highlights and if you extend both ends of the calendar year. The 
first 1990 event at the County Museum of Art, for example, is a double bill of 
contemporary artists' traveling retrospectives that debuted last year in other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
One is a survey of British artist Francis Bacon's work, organized by the 
Hirshhorn Museum in Washington to mark his 80th birthday in 1989. The eagerly 
awaited celebration of an artist whom many critics consider to be the best 
living painter will be at the County Museum of Art from Feb. 11 to April 29, 
then go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York (May 23-Sept. 4). 
</P>
<P>
"Helen Frankenthaler: A Paintings Retrospective," which honors a New York 
painter known for stained abstractions, premiered at MoMA last year. The show 
of 40 years' work will appear at LACMA from Feb. 11 to April 22, then have its 
final engagement (Nov. 5-Jan. 7, 1991) at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest feather in LACMA's cap this year may turn out to be a brand-new 
exhibition, called "The Fauve Landscape." Judi Freeman, the museum's associate 
curator of 20th-Century art, has selected 175 paintings made between 1904 and 
1906 by artists who were dubbed fauves (wild beasts) because of their use of 
vivid, unnatural color and their modern vision. The show will premiere at the 
County Museum of Art (Oct. 4-Dec. 30) before moving on to the Met (Feb. 14-May 
5, 1991) and the Royal Academy of Art in London, (June 13-Aug. 18, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most important 1990 exhibitions at Los Angeles' Museum of 
Contemporary Art are also major traveling shows. One, a long overdue 
retrospective for Los Angeles conceptual artist John Baldessari, was organized 
by MOCA and will appear there first (March 25-June 17). Then the show will set 
out on an exhaustive tour, going to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 
(July 12-Sept. 16), the Hirshhorn Museum (Oct. 16-Jan. 6, 1991), the Walker Art 
Center in Minneapolis (Feb. 3-April 28, 1991) and the Whitney Museum of 
American Art in New York (July 10-Sept. 29, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, MOCA will honor another internationally known Los 
Angeles artist, Edward Ruscha. His exhibition of about 50 paintings from the 
'80s, which was organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam and 
the Pompidou Center in Paris, will wind up in Los Angeles (Dec. 9-Feb. 24, 
1991) at the end of an international tour. 
</P>
<P>
As the world grows smaller through speedy transportation and instant 
communication, art shows take to the road almost as routinely as people. This 
tends to homogenize the art scene for frequent fliers, making it appear that 
the same exhibitions eventually pop up in every major city -- right next to 
McDonald's hamburger stands. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Angelenos continually complain -- with justification -- that 
many important exhibitions never come here. The 1990 list of major attractions 
that are not booked in the Southland includes the following: 
</P>
<P>
- "Matisse in Morocco: The Paintings and Drawings, 1912-1913." The exploration 
of a short but vital period of the French modernist's oeuvre will be at 
National Gallery in Washington (March 18-June 3), New York's Museum of Modern 
Art (June 24-Sept. 4), the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow (Sept. 28-Nov. 
20) and the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad (Dec. 15-Feb. 15, 1991). The show 
will include 24 paintings -- about half of them from Soviet collections -- and 
36 drawings made while Matisse traveled around a country that he considered an 
earthly paradise.

- "Titian, Prince of Painters." The assembly of 60 works will celebrate the 
Venetian Renaissance master's 500th birthday at the Ducal Palace in Venice 
(June 1-Oct. 7) and the National Gallery (Oct. 28-Jan. 27, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
- "Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings." Sure to be a popular success, the 
exhibition of 90 paintings will include images of haystacks, the Rouen 
Cathedral, gardens at Giverny and other subjects that Monet painted repeatedly 
during the 1890s. The show will appear at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston 
(Feb. 7-April 29), the Art Institute of Chicago (May 19-July 21) and the Royal 
Academy in London (Sept. 7 to Dec. 9). 
</P>
<P>
- "From Poussin to Matisse: The Russian Taste for French Painting." The 
Hermitage and Pushkin museums have agreed to lend 50 paintings for this 
exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (May 20-July 29) and the Art 
Institute of Chicago (Sept. 8-Nov. 25). 
</P>
<P>
Regrettable as these losses may be, Los Angeles isn't exactly out of the 
traveling show loop. The County Museum of Art has scheduled a staggering array 
of exhibitions to be trucked in from afar. They include "Envisioning America: 
Prints, Drawings and Photography by Georg Grosz and His Contemporaries," 
featuring German Expressionist views of America (April 19-June 24); "Thomas 
Hart Benton: An American Original," a retrospective of 81 paintings by the 
American Regionalist (April 29-July 22) and "The New Vision," 125 innovative 
works by 70 modernist photographers (May 10-July 15). 
</P>
<P>
Also on LACMA's 1990 agenda of traveling shows are "A Primal Spirit: 10 
Contemporary Japanese Sculptors" (June 17-Aug. 26), "Treasures From the 
Fitzwilliam Museum" (June 21-Sept. 9) and "Masterpieces of Impressionism and 
Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg Collection" (Aug. 16-Nov. 4). 
</P>
<P>
The first imported attraction at Armand Hammer's new museum in Westwood, which 
he plans to open in May, will be a landmark retrospective of works by Soviet 
modernist Kasimir Malevich (Nov. 25-Jan. 13, 1991). The exhibition of more than 
100 paintings and works on paper, primarily from Soviet museums, will have its 
first U.S. engagement at the National Gallery in Washington (Sept. 16-Nov. 4) 
and end a three-city tour at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (Feb. 
3-March 24, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art will present paintings from the "AMERIKA" series 
by Tim Rollins and KOS, a highly publicized New York workshop for adolescent 
artists (July 8-Sept. 2). Among other imports, MOCA will adapt Ellen 
Sebastian's "Sanctified" performance piece as a collaborative exhibition with 
Betye Saar (April 22-July 22). "The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the 
Aesthetics of Plenty" (Nov. 4-Jan. 13, 1991) will present a British group's 
responses to American technology, mass media and popular culture in a show that 
MOCA has jointly organized with the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, 
UC Berkeley's University Art Museum and the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum will start off the year with "Success Is a Job in 
New York: The Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol" (Jan. 21-March 18). This 
exhibition on Warhol's early development as a designer and artist, featuring 
194 works made between 1945 and 1963, was organized by the Grey Art Gallery at 
New York University. "Tony Cragg: Investigations into Chaos" is a Newport 
production, however, and a big one at that. The first solo American exhibition 
of works by the British sculptor will premiere at the Newport museum (Oct. 
14-Dec. 30) before going on a national tour. 
</P>
<P>
Still other exhibitions are for local consumption only. Out-of-towners will 
have to come here to see them. The California Afro-American Museum, for 
example, will present "The Blues Aesthetic: Black Culture and Modernism," an 
examination of a merger of blues music, black folk culture and modernist 
elements (Jan. 13-March 4). More or less concurrently (Jan. 31-March 3), USC's 
Fisher Art Gallery will offer "Celebrations: Sights and Sounds of Being," an 
exhibition of paintings, prints and sculptures by 25 African-American artists, 
which will be accompanied by taped music. 
</P>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Museum's exhibition program will continue to offer important 
glimpses of the museum's steadily growing collection in small, comprehensible 
shows. This year's agenda includes "Renaissance and Mannerist Drawings in 
Northern Europe" (Jan. 9-March 25), "The Art of the Written Word: Medieval and 
Renaissance Calligraphy in Illuminated Manuscripts" (Jan. 16-April 1) and 
"Carleton Watkins: Western Landscape and the Classical Vision," a show of 
19th-Century photographs (March 13-May 27). 
</P>
<P>
The Getty generally concentrates on its own art, but this year a rare loan 
exhibition will bring 32 objects from the Cyprus Museum and three from the 
Menil Collection in Houston together with a Getty-owned idol in a special 
exhibition called "Chalcolithic Cyprus" (Feb. 22-April 11). Sculpture and 
pottery dating from 3500 BC will include new finds from excavations at 
Kissonerga on the island of Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Whether any or all of these exhibitions -- not to mention hundreds of others -- 
will live up to our most optimistic expectations remains to be seen. It's a 
sure thing that both homebound and peripatetic art aficionados can keep very 
busy covering the 1990 scene.

'TRAVELIN' GOURMET'ON PBS: COOKING WITH FUN

<P>
On PBS, where, let's face it, most food shows have treated food preparation as 
a quasi-sacramental act, Mike Kalina is the culinary equivalent of a 
pie-throwing priest. 
</P>
<P>
Kalina is the host-cum-standup-comedian of "The Travelin' Gourmet," a new PBS 
food and travel show that peppers its 30 minutes of practical tips on cooking 
and back-kitchen visits to famous European eateries with a most untraditional 
PBS ingredient -- fun. 
</P>
<P>
In high-concept terms, think Robin Leach meets Ralph Kramden meets Steve Allen 
for dinner and jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Kalina, a heretofore obscure restaurant critic from Pittsburgh, knows exactly 
why he's so popular with local PBS station managers and little old ladies from 
Texas who are writing in for copies of his recipes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like Everyman in the show," says Kalina, 46, in his home on Pittsburgh's 
proletarian but rapidly yuppifying South Side. "I don't take myself or food 
seriously." 
</P>
<P>
He's not aiming at hard-core Bicoastal foodies, and French IV is not a 
prerequisite for his show. "I don't care about foodies. They can watch Pierre 
Franey and get the Rosetta Stone to understand what he's saying. My 
geographical location has helped me to be a very ordinary common man, and 
that's part of the charm of the show. Everyone can relate to me. It's hard to 
be haughty when you live on the South Side of Pittsburgh." 
</P>
<P>
Mixing fun with food is also getting to be profitable for Kalina, a chunky, 
videogenic dynamo who's on the verge of becoming a one-man, multimedia 
conglomerate of food. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to "The Travelin' Gourmet" -- seen on nearly 180 PBS stations from 
Boston and Manhattan to Nome and Huntington Beach (it debuts on KCET on 
Saturday, Jan. 27 at 2 p.m.), and shown overseas in places like Hong Kong -- 
Kalina has just signed a two-cookbook deal with New American Library. 
</P>
<P>
His two weekly newspaper columns -- "The Lazy Gourmet" built around 
fancy-but-easy recipes and "The Travelin' Gourmet" for Sunday papers -- are 
being readied for newspaper syndication by King Features. 
</P>
<P>
And the latest buzz from Kalina enterprises is that the Nederlander Group in 
New York City is talking about producing a five-day-a-week, 30-minute food show 
for a major cable network. 
</P>
<P>
It would star Kalina, of course, who describes the show as "Phil Donahue with 
cholesterol. I'd have guests and cook food and go on location and review 
cookbooks and interview the token bulemic," he says in his best standup-ese. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the works is a syndicated radio insert-show of one-minute food blurbs 
called "Off the Eaten Path." It features such Kalina-istic specialties as tips 
on how to poach salmon in your dishwasher or make grilled cheese sandwiches 
with a steam iron. 
</P>
<P>
There's more. How about a Museum of Food in Pittsburgh? Kalina, who co-founded 
the thriving International Culinary Academy here, already has got a headful of 
research and plans. 
</P>
<P>
How about a food-trivia game show? Kalina's already shot a half-hour demo of "A 
Piece of the Pie." He conceived it, invented such "Jeopardy"-like categories as 
"Edible Quotes" and the final "Pressure Cooker Round," and wrote the questions. 
</P>
<P>
Kalina is no accident. He's quick to point out that he knows his way around the 
kitchen, and that he's calculatedly spent the last 15 years researching food, 
thinking food, eating food. He's taken cooking classes all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's the bottom line," he says seriously. "I feel like the only game in 
town. The entire world, not just a few people, the entire universe -- other 
than me -- has neglected the commerciality of food. 
</P>
<P>
Kalina is a nonstop idea factory specializing in food spinoffs. "Life Styles of 
the Rich and Famished" was the original title for "The Travelin' Gourmet." 
Kalina pitched it to a Hollywood producer whom he met at the Pittsburgh 
airport. The producer liked the idea and Kalina soon found himself jetting to 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"I met these hot-shot executives with New World," Kalina recalls. "These guys 
were all driving cars that sounded like pasta -- Lamborghinis, fettuccines, 
Ferraris. And they all had tans on the telephone, you know, typical L.A." 
</P>
<P>
Kalina, who wrote and sings the rappy theme song "Born to Eat," shot 13 shows 
in seven European countries. Each show starts with him in somewhere like 
Scotland or Rome and ends with him demonstrating how to make things like apple 
strudel or pasta in his own kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Now Kalina wants to raise more financing to shoot more episodes of "The 
Travelin' Gourmet." "I may just end up a flash in the saute pan if I don't get 
the money," he says. "I want to become -- and I say this with all humility -- 
the Jacques Costeau of food. I want to go eat whale blubber with Eskimos. . . . 
I want to explore the whole dining experience all over the world, and make it 
fun -- bring the whole realm of the food-lover's joy into people's homes." 
</P>
<P>
Kalina may be on to something. He has found his audience out there. Just the 
other morning a Pittsburgh city bus driver recognized him as "The Travelin' 
Gourmet" and let him on the bus for free.

NURSING HOMES TURN AWAY FROM TETHERING THE ELDERLY; 
</P>
<P>
ELDER CARE: RESTRAINTS HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED STANDARD PRACTICE TO PROTECT 
PATIENTS WHO MIGHT FALL OR WANDER AWAY. BUT NURSING HOMES ARE FINDING 
ALTERNATIVES -- AND FINDING THAT FREEING PATIENTS HAS MANY BENEFITS.

<P>
William Harmon used to spend every day tied to a chair in a nursing home, 
sometimes in a stupor, sometimes pleading to be freed. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd just sit there all day long, every body tied in restraints," said Mabel 
Harmon, who moved her 70-year-old husband out of the home in August. "I don't 
think he would be living now if he hadn't gotten out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon's situation was not unique. Two out of five residents of American 
nursing homes routinely are tied to their beds or chairs, ostensibly to protect 
them from injury. Concern is mounting that such restraints may do more harm 
than good. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon now is at Stapeley in the German town section of Philadelphia. It is one 
of a small but growing number of homes that use no restraints. 
</P>
<P>
Since he's been over at Stapeley he's a completely different person," Mabel 
Harmon said. "He does what he wants to do. He answers your questions. He walks 
up and down the hall. He goes into the lounge." 
</P>
<P>
Nursing home administrators say that devices such as lap belts, wheelchairs 
with locking trays and vests that tie to beds or chairs are used mainly to keep 
residents from falling or wandering away and to control aggressive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Critics say that restraints often are used for the staff's convenience and 
seldom eliminate the risk of injury. They say that tying people can cause or 
aggravate problems such as emotional withdrawal and depression, and that 
injuries are incurred in trying to get free. Strangulation, constipation, 
incontinence, pressure sores, loss of bone mass, weakened muscles and decreased 
ability to walk are the ultimate consequences for many of those who are 
tethered, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask ourselves: What price safety?" said Jill Blakeslee, director of 
health services for the Kendal Corp., a nonprofit, Quaker-run Pennsylvania 
corporation that has pioneered the concept of restraint-free nursing homes in 
the United States. "Safe and quality care can be given to our frail old people 
without tying them to their beds and their chairs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Think About Yourself 
</P>
<P>
Kendal and the Senate Committee on Aging last month sponsored a symposium, 
"Untie the Elderly: Quality Care Without Restraints," at which Blakeslee spoke. 
"Think about yourself as you grow old," she told participants. "Is that what 
you would want?" 
</P>
<P>
Michael Plevyak's family chose to place his 74-year-old mother, Genevieve, who 
has Alzheimer's disease, at Friends Hall in West Chester, Pa., because she 
would not be tied there. "The only thing she desires to do is move about and 
walk. That's why we're so thrilled that she is in a facility that allows her to 
engage in the one activity she gets any joy out of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 199, 41% of all nursing home residents were restrained; in 1977, the 
proportion was 25%, federal surveys show. Restraints were involved in 37 deaths 
in U.S. and Canadian nursing homes between 1980 and 1987. The deaths primarily 
were caused by strangulation or suffocation -- but in two cases the victims 
burned to death after setting fire to their restraints in an attempt to escape. 
</P>
<P>
In U.S. and Canadian nursing homes studied over the last decade, restraint 
rates ranged from 25% to 85%, Neville Strumpf and Lois Evans of the University 
of Pennsylvania School of Nursing reported in the January, 1989, issue of the 
Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawsuits Feared 
</P>
<P>
Family members at first may be horrified to learn that their relative is 
restrained, but medical professionals "can talk people into a big variety of 
things that afterwards they must wonder about," said Lynne Mitchell-Pederson, a 
nurse at St. Boniface General Hospital in Winnipeg, Canada. St. Boniface has 
all but eliminated the practice of tying patients since a restrained woman 
strangled in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, there are attorneys and family members "wanting and willing 
to sue if a home doesn't use protective devices to protect the resident," said 
Fred Watson, administrator of the Christian City Convalescent Center in 
Atlanta. "We've got to get over that hurdle." 
</P>
<P>
Christian City was restraint-free when it opened 12 years ago, but began using 
the devices under pressure from insurance carriers, doctors and families, 
Watson said. It now restrains 20% to 30% of its charges, but is reducing that 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread use of restraints is widely attributed at least in part, to the 
fear of being sued, but some attorneys say that reliance on restraints as a 
liability protection is largely unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one study found that tying people resulted in more lawsuits than not 
using them, said Philadelphia attorney Alan Reeve Hunt, chairman of Kendal's 
board. For example, an Alabama jury in June held a nursing home liable for $2.5 
million in the strangulation of an 86-year-old woman in a restraint vest that 
was on backwards. The case is under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Restraints "became a standard of care without ever being tested," said Sarah 
Burger, a consultant for the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home 
Reform. "Everybody just assumed they did good." 
</P>
<P>
Growing concern about negative effects and recognition that restraints don't 
eliminate liability are leading to a reduction in their use. So far, 13 nursing 
homes in the United States are known to be restraint-free, according to Kendal. 
Tough new federal rules will take effect in October, and Florida has untied 
3,000 people since August. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a contest going on to see who's going to be the first restraint-free 
facility," Florida licensing director Connie Cheren said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a movement in its infancy," said Nancy Dubler, an attorney with 
the Department of Social Medicine at Montefiore Hospital and Medical Center in 
New York. "This is a discussion on the verge of bringing change." 
</P>
<P>
The Health Care Financing Administration reported last December that 8.5% of 
more than 15,000 nursing homes it surveyed were violating rules that allow a 
patient to be restrained "only when authorized by a physician in writing, for a 
specified period of time or in emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
The new rules ban "physical restraints imposed or psychoactive drugs 
administered for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to 
treat ... medical symptoms." Nursing homes for the first time will have to 
"show that they have tried every other conceivable means to solve the problem," 
Burger said. 
</P>
<P>
Removing restraints requires creative, individualized alternatives, said Beryl 
Goldman, Kendal associate director for health services. For example, doors that 
sound a buzzer when opened might be installed on a wanderer's room. Brightly 
colored tape placed in front of exits can help keep confused residents from 
leaving. Rocking chairs can help those who need to be in motion. 
</P>
<P>
One home was able to avoid restraining an 85-year-old woman who constantly 
paced with a doll but needed to rest so her ulcers would heal, said Joanne 
Rader, director of mental health at Benedictine Nursing Facility in Mount 
Angel, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
Staff members filled the doll with seven pounds of birdseed. "Now, when she's 
walking with the doll, she has a very heavy baby. So they say, 'Oh, that baby's 
so heavy. Why don't you sit down and put your feet up?' That's a heck of a lot 
more fun than tying a person down," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
St. Boniface's Mitchell-Pederson cited the case of one Alzheimer's patient who 
disrupted meals and stole food. "When we asked, 'Could he be hungry?' and 
doubled his calorie intake he stopped stealing food . . . In this case, it was 
his diet that needed attention; restraints compounded the problem." 
</P>
<P>
An 85-year-old woman restrained in a chair for fear that she would wander off 
and fall down the stairs was given shoes with rubber soles instead of slippers 
and "was thus allowed to wander at will throughout the building," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's tremendous excitement out there . . . toward developing and 
implementing a non-restraint philosophy. It's no fun to be the one who has to 
tie someone down when they don't want to be tied down," Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be No Alternative 
</P>
<P>
Some nursing home officials, however, caution that there are cases where there 
are no clear alternatives to restraints. 
</P>
<P>
"While we can agree that overuse or wholesale use of restraints is not 
desirable, it is equally wrong to say no restraints should ever be used," said 
David Mettler of Hillhaven Corp., which runs 345 nursing homes in 38 states. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a black-and-white issue," Mettler said. "Sometimes it may even be 
necessary to restrict the rights of an individual resident in order to provide 
for the health and safety of others." 
</P>
<P>
For dramatic reduction in restraints, residents and families must accept that 
"if people have a certain amount of freedom, then they also run the risk of 
getting hurt," said attorney Joanne Ivancic of HFIC Management Co., which 
handles insurance claims for Hillhaven. 
</P>
<P>
Benedictine has eliminated most restraints, but "there's maybe 5% to 10% of the 
people that I can't figure out how get restraint-free," Rader said, citing as 
one example those who pull out tubes unless restrained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Skepticism Replaced by Praise 
</P>
<P>
Nursing home staffer who initially are skeptical about being able to manage 
residents without restraints usually find they prefer it, said Kendal's 
Goldman. She quoted from a recent letter from a nurse at Friends Hall, which in 
1987 adopted a no-restraint policy: "I wouldn't work any other place now. I 
wouldn't have said that or believed it two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
Nine nursing homes in a Kendal demonstration program have reduced restraint use 
without increasing falls, staff or costs, Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
That is possible because residents who can move around generally stay healthier 
and require less care. Blakeslee said. Also, it takes a lot of time to properly 
apply restraints and remove them for exercise and use of bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Stapeley in 1988 set a goal of untying five residents a month and a year later 
removed the last restraint, said Henrietta Roberts, executive director. "I 
can't tell you how the families have been pleased by this. The sense of 
humanitarianism, the sense that you are dealing with a person . . . has made a 
great deal of difference. The patients are easier to care for." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the change at Stapeley include Bernie Lieberman, whose 
89-year-old mother, Frances, had been routinely restrained after she fell and 
broke a hip. Now, staffers help her walk and she wears no restraints while 
seated. 
</P>
<P>
"She seems much more cheerful and positive as a result of having more freedom," 
Lieberman said. "Even though her mind was not working well, she was just the 
kind of person who wanted to get up and walk."

ALASKA'S OLDEST COLLEGE IS AN ISLAND IN SEA OF EDUCATION 
</P>

SITKA, Alaska 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Sagoonick's latest package from home contained dried fish, reindeer sausage 
and raw whale meat. 
</P>
<P>
For Sagoonick, 18, a freshman at Sheldon Jackson College here in Sitka, home is 
Shaktoolik, a tiny Eskimo village on the Bering Sea's Norton Sound, nearly 
2,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the 280 full-time students at Sheldon Jackson College, 
Alaska's oldest educational institution, are Eskimos and Indians from small 
remote villages scattered across the nation's largest state. 
</P>
<P>
For Sagoonick, the piece de resistance of his "care" package was muktuk, as 
Eskimos call raw whale meat. "Muktuk is the main part of our diet in 
Shaktoolik," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
"All Eskimo students here at Sheldon Jackson have muktuk air mailed to them by 
their families at various times during the year. It keeps our spirits up, our 
stomachs happy." 
</P>
<P>
Sagoonick's father and grandfather are reindeer herders in his village of 200 
Eskimos. They graze 1,800 reindeer on lichen. "We round up the animals on snow 
machines and sell the meat, hide and antlers. Our village has some of the 
severest weather on earth -- howling winds off the Bering Sea and blizzards. 
Fifty below zero happens all the time in winter," Sagoonick says. 
</P>
<P>
The young man was one of three graduates of Shaktoolik High School last year. 
He is the first in his family to go to college, where he is working toward a 
degree in education so he can return to his village as a teacher. 
</P>

Few outside Alaska know of Sheldon Jackson College, which was founded in 1878 
in the old Russian barracks in Sitka, 11 years after Russia sold Alaska to 
America for $7.2 million (less than two cents an acre). Sitka was the capital 
of Russian America from 1808 to 1867. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon Jackson was a Presbyterian minister who lived from 1834 to 1909. He 
introduced reindeer into Alaska from Siberia as a food source for isolated 
native villages. 
</P>
<P>
But he was also Alaska's first commissioner of education. In 1878, he launched 
the school that bears his name. At first it was a vocational school, later an 
elementary school and a high school. In 1944, it began offering college 
courses, and finally in 1967, it became a full-fledged junior college. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the 289-acre campus, with its cedar buildings of 
English Tudor-style architecture, has made a transition to a four-year college 
offering Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. The school continues 
to have close ties to the Presbyterian Church, which provides 20% of its $4.3 
million annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
Sheldon Jackson has a faculty of 35, with a student-faculty ratio of 9 to 1. 
Tuition, room and board is $8,600 a year, with 90% of the students receiving 
some form of financial aid and 20% on full scholarship for tuition and 
expenses. In the last five years, there has been $11 million of new 
construction on campus. 
</P>
<P>
This is one of the most out-of-the-way colleges in the United States. Located 
on Baranof Island in Southeast Alaska, it is accessible only by plane or boat. 
There are only 18 miles of road on the densely forested, mountainous, 
100-mile-long, 30-mile-wide island, which has a population of 10,000; of those, 
8,000 live in Sitka. 
</P>
<P>
The school has provided teachers for remote native villages ever since its 
establishment. Now, however, the teachers are getting college degrees. In the 
past, they taught after two years of college education, before that with only 
high school education, and many years ago, they became teachers after 
completing elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
"Sheldon Jackson is no longer a natives-only school. Today, nearly half the 
students are not Indian or Eskimo, and one-fourth are from the Lower 48 
States," says the school's eighth president, Michael Kaelke, 50. 
</P>
<P>
"The college has made a transition to a multicultural institution in the past 
few years. We feel it is important that young people coming from remote 
villages are introduced to, and have personal contact with, men and women their 
age from other backgrounds. Eskimos and Indians from the tiny villages are 
rooming with, and getting to know students from, other parts of Alaska, from 
other states like New York, Massachusetts, California and Washington, who come 
from large schools and from large cities." 
</P>
<P>
Kaelke said Eskimo and Indian students for the most part major in education or 
in business administration to return to their villages to teach, or to work for 
the government or for Alaska native corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the non-natives attend Sheldon Jackson because of its excellent natural 
resources programs, majoring in aquatic resources or marine sciences. The 
school boasts a multimillion-dollar hatchery that incubates 16 million salmon 
eggs each year and releases them as "fry" in spring. It is the largest such 
facility on any campus in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Many students from the Lower 48 are attracted to Sheldon Jackson because of 
the Alaska adventure, the Alaska mystique, the uniqueness of its student body 
and remoteness of the campus," said Kaelke. 
</P>
<P>
Bald eagles soar over the school throughout the year. Bears roam the wilderness 
in the woods adjacent to classroom buildings. Humpback and killer whales, sea 
lions, seals and porpoises swim in the waters of the Pacific Ocean, a stone's 
throw from the school. Towering mountains form a backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
It was here in a cottage on the school grounds that James Michener worked as 
author-in-residence from 1985 to 1987 while researching and writing his novel 
"Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
Indian and Eskimo students fish in the ocean, in a fleet of boats owned by the 
school, for giant halibut weighing 80 pounds and more. They hunt in the nearby 
woods for game. They cook the fish and meat in the school kitchen, from time to 
time, to make the college feel more like home. 
</P>
<P>
"We are more relaxed here than we would be if we went to a larger school in a 
city," said Anita Andrews, 20, an Eskimo from Mountain Village, 1,500 miles to 
the north on the Yukon River. "For us, Sitka is a big city. 
</P>
<P>
"We are more comfortable being with others from small villages who know and 
understand our culture, yet at the same time, we are getting to know people of 
other cultures from Alaska and the Lower 48 who also attend Sheldon Jackson."

THE DAFFY WORLD OF CHUCK JONES; 
</P>
<P>
AN ANIMATED DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CARTOONS AND THE CHARACTERS OF THE INFLUENTIAL 
OSCAR-WINNER WHO'S STILL GOING 'AMUCK' AT 77 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
"If you were a young art student in 1931, the only thing you could really 
conceive of doing was graduating, going to Paris, getting a place among the 
chimney pots, painting and dying at some ancient age like 37 -- sort of like a 
male Camille," says Chuck Jones with a characteristic laugh. "But I came to the 
horrid realization that it costs money to die poor: You've got to get to Paris, 
rent an apartment, buy all those cobwebs -- the whole bit." 
</P>
<P>
The then 19-year-old graduate of the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles 
never realized his romantic dream of painting and dying young in Paris, and the 
arts of animation and film comedy are richer for it. 
</P>
<P>
He got a job as a cel washer at the Ub Iwerks Studio in Beverly Hills, cleaning 
the ink off sheets of acetate so they could be reused. This humble beginning 
led to a brilliant career in animation: Jones went on to create Wile E. Coyote, 
the Road Runner and Pepe LePew, and to direct many of the best cartoons with 
Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig and Elmer Fudd. 
</P>
<P>
He won three Oscars, a Peabody Award and ASIFA/Hollywood's Annie Award, and has 
been honored by the British Film Institute, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
and Sciences and film festivals all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime resident of Newport Beach, Jones, now 77, chronicled his life and 
career in his recent book "Chuck Amuck: The Life and Times of an Animated 
Cartoonist" (Farrar Straus Giroux). Rambling, informal and very funny, part 
memoir, part sketchbook and part how-to-animate manual, "Chuck Amuck" has 
received rave reviews in magazines and newspapers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Animators usually are portrayed as tongue-tied artists who can communicate only 
through their drawings, or as loony-bin zanies whose antics rival their 
characters. Jones shatters both stereotypes: In person, he is articulate, witty 
and charming. 
</P>
<P>
He discusses animation, literature, art history and politics with equal zest, 
and quotes Santayana's definition of a fanatic ("One who redoubles his effort 
after he loses sight of his goal") to describe Wile E. Coyote's monomaniac 
pursuit of the Road Runner. The improbable pairing of the author of "Realms of 
Being" with the hilariously inept Coyote sums up the breadth of Jones' 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
The cels-washing job didn't last long: Jones soon was promoted to assistant 
animator, then full-fledged animator. He worked briefly for Charles Mintz and 
Walter Lantz before settling down at the Leon Schlesinger studio, making Looney 
Tunes and Merrie Melodies. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of art school during the Depression, the idea of getting a job was 
surprising," Jones recalls. "The idea of getting a job doing something you 
liked was beyond belief." 
</P>
<P>
Promoted to director in 1938, Jones made his best films after World War II when 
he, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson each headed a unit at Warner Bros., 
turning out 10 six-minute cartoons a year. All three directors used many of the 
same characters and gags, but they approached the material differently. 
</P>
<P>
The hallmarks of Jones' mature style are crispness, clarity and subtlety. Of 
the Warner directors, he was the most strongly influenced by the Disney films, 
especially the appealing designs and vivid character animation of master 
animator Fred Moore. Tex Avery might make a character's eyes swell to the size 
of searchlights, or fly across the room to ogle a pretty girl; Jones would have 
the character glance quickly at the audience or flicker an eyebrow. He cites 
the influence of Buster Keaton and the other great silent comics on his use of 
body language and expressions that make the characters in his films seem like 
living, thinking beings. 
</P>
<P>
"I went on the supposition -- although I probably wasn't able to verbalize it 
-- that every character I worked with had to come from inside myself," he 
explains. "To make a heroic allusion, Laurence Olivier said he never had to 
leave himself when he acted; similarly, Daffy Duck is inside me. So is Bugs 
Bunny, in the sense that he's what I'd like to be, but Daffy is what I know 
full well I am: You can dream about being Bugs, but when you look in the mirror 
in the morning, you see Daffy. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned the first thing you need to have in a film is believability," he 
continues. "Believability is the character standing there on the ground -- 
which poses the same problem Degas and all painters have: The viewer has to 
believe that character is really standing there, that he's part of the Earth, 
with weight. If a character's believable, you can try to evoke sympathy for 
him. The audience has to care about the people they're watching for you to 
create lasting humor. Believability, sympathy (through character development) 
and humor are the way to tickle people and make them laugh." 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to spot these ideas at work in Jones' postwar films such as "One 
Froggy Evening," "Duck Amuck," "Rabbit of Seville," "Long-Haired Hare," "A Bear 
for Punishment" and "Robin Hood Daffy." It's extremely difficult to communicate 
subtle nuances of expression and behavior in animation, and many of the best 
young animators cite Jones as an important influence on their own work. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't hope for a better example of the pure principles of animation at 
work than Chuck Jones' cartoons," says Duncan Majoribanks, who did the key 
animation of Sebastian, the calypso-voiced crab in Disney's current release 
"The Little Mermaid." "What I love best about his films is the acting: His 
characters are the most fully rounded personalities ever animated -- they're at 
least the equal of any live actors of the period." 
</P>
<P>
"In a lot of his films, Jones makes the character think about what he's doing 
before he does it, as opposed to just moving the character around," agrees Nik 
Ranieri, who did animation for both "Little Mermaid" and "Who Framed Roger 
Rabbit." "Even if the character's not speaking, you can see the thought process 
going on. His films have definitely influenced my own work in the way I 
approach a scene and act it out: I try to keep the subtlety of his approach in 
mind, and get the idea across in one drawing as opposed to a violent action." 
</P>
<P>
The influence of his comic timing, especially in the Road Runner-Coyote series, 
extends into the realm of live-action film making. Steven Spielberg (who wrote 
the forward to "Chuck Amuck"), Peter Bogdanovich and Joe Dante are among the 
directors who pay tribute to Jones' work. The kids in Dante's "Gremlins" 
attended Charles Martin Jones Jr. High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't look back to specific moments in cartoons to imitate in my films, but 
there is a general sense of timing you pick up watching cartoons," Dante says. 
"Cartoons and features are very different, especially spatially, but verbal 
timing is very important in both, and the timing in Chuck's dialogue scenes is 
really unmatched. I've often thought that Chuck could have been a good feature 
director. If he had the kind of rapport with actors that he did with animators 
and voice people, he would have made some interesting films." 
</P>
<P>
Jones appears and acts considerably younger than his 77 years. In addition to 
signing hundreds of books, he keeps busy advising on films, drawing and 
painting. One of his current projects is a series of lithographs of the Warners 
characters, done in the style of various Impressionist and Post-Impressionist 
artists. His most recent Christmas card was a deft spoof of a Toulouse-Lautrec 
poster, with Daffy Duck as La Golue. 
</P>
<P>
He insists that he didn't plan on writing "Chuck Amuck" until his wife, Marian 
Dern Jones, who used to write the syndicated comic strip "Rick O'Shay," started 
a book on their life together, "How Can I Kiss You When I'm Laughing." 
</P>
<P>
"She did a great beginning on it, so we put a dummy together and took it to New 
York," he says. "But the publishers there said, 'She's writing about somebody 
nobody knows about: We figure it'd be a good idea for you to write a book 
first, to justify her writing one.' So that's how it all started. Nothing's 
ever done for the logical reason, is it?"

HOW CARTOONIST CHARACTERIZES HIS OLD PALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chuck Jones on a few of the Warner Brothers characters: 
</P>
<P>
Bugs Bunny: 
</P>
<P>
"Bugs was a very unusual character at Warners -- a comic hero. He started out 
in a Harpo Marx mode, went through Groucho and ended up as a combination of Rex 
Harrison playing Professor Higgins (who would like to stay in and mind his own 
business, although still a very intellectual bird), D'Artagnan (because of the 
things he could do) and Dorothy Parker (because of the quips). 
</P>
<P>
If you blend those together, you have a pretty good idea of what Bugs was all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Wile E. Coyote: 
</P>
<P>
"The substance of all the Road Runner-Coyote pictures is not how to catch a 
road runner, it's how many ways you can't catch a road runner. The Coyote is 
his own worst enemy, which is true of all of us. To me, his relationship with 
the Acme Co. is the perfect symbiosis: The Coyote supports the Acme Company by 
buying -- or at least using -- the things they manufacture; the Acme Co. 
survives by supplying them to him." 
</P>
<P>
Daffy Duck: 
</P>
<P>
"For Daffy, go back to when you were 6 years old. After you blow out the 
candles, your parents hand you the knife and say, 'It's your birthday and you 
can cut as big a piece of cake as you want.' You know full well that isn't 
true: There's a particular wedge that's surrounded by corporal punishment -- if 
you exceed it, you'll be sent to your room as a selfish little cad who doesn't 
want anybody else to have any. Daffy does what we don't have the guts to do: He 
grabs the whole cake and runs!"

OUTCRY CONTINUES OVER FIRST-BABY-BORN-IN-DECADE DERBY; 
</P>
<P>
BIRTH: ARE DEADLINE DELIVERIES UNHEALTHY? SOME EXPERTS SAY THAT, AS A RULE,

<P>
A decades-old tradition -- the New Year's Day baby derby -- was in full swing 
this Jan. 1, and as usual, parents, doctors and hospitals alike were working 
hard to win it. 
</P>
<P>
In a Fountain Valley hospital, the clock ticked toward midnight as a 
28-year-old woman tried mightily to push her baby into the world. But as her 
doctor eyed the clock, she was suddenly ordered to "hold it!" while a radio 
announcer counted down the final seconds of 1989 -- and only then was she once 
again told to "push!" At 20 seconds after midnight, 9-pound, 7-ounce Michelle 
Tran was born, briefly believed to be the first baby of 1990 for Orange and Los 
Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
But wait: Five seconds earlier a 6-pound, 12-ounce girl was born in an Anaheim 
birthing center, delivered by a general practitioner who used forceps to pull 
the newborn out in an effort to deliver the first baby of the decade. He 
immediately tucked the baby in a Christmas stocking and rushed her next door to 
show her off to 4,000 people at the Melodyland religious service. 
</P>
<P>
And at the same moment in Tarzana, a physician was in the middle of performing 
a Cesarean section that resulted in twin boys, one born a minute before 
midnight, the other a minute after. 
</P>
<P>
There are prizes in this obstetrical version of "Beat the Clock" -- publicity 
for obstetricians and their hospitals, celebrity status for the lucky infant 
and, for the parents, sometimes a shower of gifts ranging from diapers and 
infant formula to college scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
But recently, medical leaders have criticized the "circus" atmosphere 
surrounding some of these births. 
</P>
<P>
Joining them were medical ethicists, feminists and advocates of natural 
birthing methods who worry that tampering with the birth process -- either by 
significantly slowing it down, speeding it up or scheduling a Cesarean section 
for convenience rather than medical necessity -- could be risky. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors note that deliveries scheduled primarily for convenience are still rare 
-- and expressly forbidden by guidelines from the American College of 
Obstetrics and Gynecology. Also, after reading press accounts of this New 
Year's stroke-of-midnight births, many doctors said they did not believe most 
of the Jan. 1 deliveries in Southern California were particularly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the race for "the baby of the decade" produced widespread concern. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should take something as serious as the birth of a baby into 
a contest," said Dr. William G. Plested, a Santa Monica cardiovascular surgeon 
who is president of the California Medical Assn. "The primary interest of the 
physician should be the protection of his patients, both the mother and child." 
</P>
<P>
Agreed University of Minnesota bioethicist Arthur Caplan, "Anything that is 
done for reasons other than the health of the patient is not consistent with 
good medical ethics." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Deliveries 
</P>
<P>
It is risky to engage in practices that could lead to something worse, Caplan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Let's push at 11:59' could lead to inducing labor at 10 so we get a delivery 
at 12:01," he said. "There's some danger that what starts out as cute or 
humanitarian might slide into getting competitive and dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the practice of scheduling deliveries for reasons beyond the medical 
ones is an old one, doctors and patients said. 
</P>
<P>
They cited births that have been arranged to coincide with a doctor's office 
hours, a mother-to-be's "lucky day" or a father's desire to take a year-end tax 
deduction. 
</P>
<P>
There is also a widespread suspicion, roundly denied by obstetricians, that 
timed births benefit doctors who have season tickets to sporting or theatrical 
events, said Jay Hathaway of Sherman Oaks, executive director of a national 
group promoting a child birth method called the Bradley Method. 
</P>
<P>
But pregnant women -- some of them quite prominent -- have often demanded 
carefully timed deliveries themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Quayle, the vice president's wife, reportedly told her doctor to induce 
labor around the due date of her first child to ensure she would be able to 
take a scheduled bar exam. As a result, friends said, with her son newly 
delivered, the new mother took her exam seated gingerly on a rubber doughnut 
cushion. 
</P>
<P>
England's Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, also had her baby early, reportedly 
because she was tired of being pregnant. Told that her labor probably would not 
start for three or four more days, the 28-year-old wife of Prince Andrew had 
her labor induced, delivering a 6-pound, 12-ounce baby Aug. 8, 1988 -- or 
8/8/88 -- a date numerologists promptly declared as the luckiest in the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Induced labor for convenience came into vogue in the United States during the 
1960s and early 1970s, experts on maternal health said, after the discovery 
that the drugs oxytocin and Pitocin could speed up labor. 
</P>
<P>
During that era, one Philadelphia mother-to-be said she found herself an 
unwitting guinea pig for "speeded-up labor" 17 years ago when she entered a 
birthing center on Christmas Day to deliver her third son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deadline Pressure 
</P>
<P>
The midwives "dearly wanted a Christmas baby" and despite her objections 
administered a drug to speed up her labor, said Nora Coffey, now director of 
the HERS Foundation, a support group for women with hysterectomies. As the drug 
took hold, "a bunch of midwives were standing beside me rooting and cheering 
for him to be born on Christmas Day." 
</P>
<P>
Coffey said she really didn't care about the Christmas deadline but rather just 
"wanted to be left alone." Eventually, she got her wish. When her son was born 
about 18 minutes after midnight, the cheering squad was gone, for they had 
departed when she missed the cherished deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of inducing labor solely for convenience fell out of favor about 
10 years ago as doctors discovered that it led to many unnecessarily premature 
births -- and Cesarean sections. "This was before ultrasound was accurate, 
before people had good guidelines (for inducing labor)," said Dr. Thomas J. 
Garite, UCI's chief of obstetrics, "so people were inducing labor very 
haphazardly, and they paid the price." 
</P>
<P>
About eight years ago, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology issued 
guidelines limiting "elective induction" of labor. In addition, said Dr. Edward 
J. Quilligan, a nationally known professor of obstetrics at UC Irvine, 
obstetricians are urged now to encourage women who have had a previous Cesarean 
to attempt to deliver their subsequent babies vaginally, rather than 
automatically scheduling them for another surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Quilligan said his motto on delivering babies is a simple one: "Let the baby 
pick the time." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he and other doctors said they saw nothing wrong with making slight 
changes in the timing of a birth -- if the baby is mature and expected to be 
born at about that time anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll get mothers who want to deliver after midnight because it's the 
birthday of their husband or grandma is coming into town the next day," 
explained Garite. "If it's 11:45 at night and they want to wait 15 minutes, 
it's OK if it's done with good judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, "if you were going to do a Cesarean for a very good reason and it 
wasn't super-emergent, it wouldn't matter if you did it at midnight" or waited 
15 or 30 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like anything else in life. As long as you do it safely, it's fine. But 
if you get a little overzealous and let desires (for a timed birth) overwhelm 
your interest in safety, your good judgment, you're in trouble," Garite said. 
</P>
<P>
One obstetrician explained that he once timed a delivery -- but safely -- so 
that his patient would deliver Orange County's first baby of the year. "This 
mom was dirt-poor," he said, "and we figured if she got the first baby, she'd 
get all these freebies -- free formula and baby blankets" and more. It was "a 
spontaneous delivery. She just pushed at the right time," he said. "And we were 
two seconds after the hour." 
</P>
<P>
Lately the "freebies" for the New Year's first child have slacked off in Orange 
County, doctors said. The Tran family of Long Beach for instance, got flowers, 
four weeks of diaper service, formula and a teddy bear. But elsewhere, such a 
baby is worth its weight in gold. In Boston, twin girls Jessica and Jennifer 
Rios, delivered at midnight and 12:01 a.m. at Brigham and Women's Hospital, 
received scholarships to Emmanuel College, a local women's college. 
</P>
<P>
Such births are also great publicity for the lucky hospital, said Lauren 
Barnett, director of the Chicago-based American Society for Hospital Marketing 
and Public Relations. "It's usually a sure story for a hospital," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It probably doesn't hurt that Jan. 1 is not a heavy news day and there's 
usually space for that kind of story." 
</P>
<P>
That was the case with the twins delivered in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Learning on New Year's Eve that their twins would be born around midnight, 
Valencia parents Glenn and Jill Iwamoto decided they prefered that each baby 
have a different birthday in a different decade. But it was strictly a 
coincidence that their wish materialized, insisted Dr. Allan Lichtman, the 
Tarzana obstetrician who performed the unscheduled Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtman said he ordered a Cesarean section at 11 p.m. after Jill had labored 
unsuccessfully for 22 hours. "We realized it takes about 40 minutes to get 
things organized, get the anesthetic and the assistants, and we realized we 
would be delivering the babies close to midnight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the babies were healthy and that he knew he had about a 10-minute 
leeway for a safe delivery. 
</P>
<P>
"The question came up -- they would have birthdays together or possibly 
separately," he said. "I asked them to think about that issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twins Span Decades 
</P>
<P>
Lichtman said he did nothing to modify his medical practice based on the 
parents' preference. As it happened, Blair Michael Rikio Iwamoto was born at 
11:59 p.m. and his brother Brooks Glenn Joji Iwamoto arrived at 12:01 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It was no Cesarean but a bit of painful persuasion that resulted in the birth 
of Michelle Tran 20 seconds after midnight, New Year's Day, at Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Obstetrician Co Pham said he reluctantly had to forgo a New Year's Eve party to 
rush to the hospital, where his patient, Khanh Quach, was in labor. Still, he 
said, "every year we do (this) for fun -- all the hospitals calling each other 
about who has the first baby of the year. . . . We're not competing, just 
asking who has the first, for fun." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Michelle's father, Long Beach store owner Joe Tran, said he and his 
wife really hadn't wanted to deliver the year's first baby. At five minutes to 
midnight when the baby was nearly out, "the doctor said, 'Hold it! You will 
have a delivery at New Year.' " 
</P>
<P>
But at the time, his wife was "in very bad pain," Tran said, and she cried. "I 
said, 'She cannot hold it,' " Tran recounted, but "he (Pham) said, 'Tell your 
wife, breathe slowly, you can hold it.' " And despite her pain, she waited past 
midnight to give that final push, Tran said. 
</P>
<P>
The delivery "hurt my wife," Tran said, but now that it is over, he has no 
complaints. "My baby is in very good health. We had a very good doctor."

FORD AEROSPACE SALE DISCUSSED FOR MONTHS, PLANT WORKERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Ford Motor Co. officials remained mum on reports that a sale of its defense 
division is in the works, employees at the firm's Newport Beach plant said 
Saturday there has been widespread talk of a sale for months. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported Saturday that Ford Motor Co. is preparing to put its 
aerospace division up for sale and that Ford's board of directors would 
consider the move as early as this week. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of a possible sale come at a time of thawing tensions between the 
United States and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, shrinking Pentagon 
budgets and uncertainty over the future of the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't only this 'I love Gorby stuff,' " said a gray-bearded 57-year-old 
technician as he left the sprawling 2,700-employee Ford Aerospace Corp. plant 
Saturday morning. "Anyone with half a brain knew that things were starting to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"Contracts have been harder and harder to get," said the technician, who asked 
not to be identified. "Competition was the name of the game, and we were 
getting beat." 
</P>
<P>
But Ford Aerospace officials continued to downplay reports of a pending sale of 
the Newport Beach-based company, which employs 17,000 worldwide and 10,000 in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"There are rumors now and there have been rumors about this kind of thing 
before," said Susan M. Pearce, Ford Aerospace's vice president of public 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The company is doing well, certainly in the context of the industry 
situation," Pearce said. "We have a significant (order) backlog. We've won some 
major contracts in the past year." 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts said the sale would follow a recent trend among large 
conglomerates to sell off small defense businesses now that the Cold War is 
winding down. Chrysler Corp., for example, recently sold its defense division, 
Chrysler Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a downturn in military spending, as we do now, these companies 
just don't want to put their money into the defense business," said Paul 
Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential Bache Research. "I can understand an auto 
company saying, 'We can get a better return on investment.' " 
</P>
<P>
One sign that Ford may be shifting from defense to focus more heavily on its 
bread-and-butter business is its $2.5-billion purchase of Jaguar, the British 
auto maker, in November, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts suggested that several major aerospace companies may be interested in 
purchasing Ford Aerospace. Among the potential buyers are Martin Marietta, 
Rockwell International, Boeing Co. and General Dynamics, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace has had a major presence in Orange County for three decades. In 
1960, Philco-Ford, a division of Ford Motor, moved its defense operation from 
Glendale to a 200-acre site in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Ford Aerospace is best known as a manufacturer of missiles, 
electro-optics systems and satellites, with annual sales of about $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Ford Aerospace has had its share of successes -- and setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
In September, NASA awarded Ford Aerospace a $500-million contract to upgrade 
the Mission Control facility at Johnson Space Center in Houston for space 
shuttle flights. And last month, the company won an additional $150-million 
contract for work at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
The awards helped soften the blow of Ford Aerospace's unsuccessful bid to win a 
$3-billion contract to build a portable, bazooka-type weapon for the Army a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Three years earlier, Ford suffered a bigger embarrassment with the cancellation 
of a multibillion dollar Army contract to build the controversial anti-aircraft 
gun known as the Sgt. York. 
</P>
<P>
Despite spending nearly $1.5 billion on the Sgt. York, the Pentagon abruptedly 
dropped the program in August, 1985, after critics charged that the weapon was 
unreliable. The cancellation forced Ford Aerospace to lay off 1,200 workers 
locally. 
</P>
<P>
The Sgt. York debacle is still fresh in the minds of many longtime workers at 
the Newport Beach plant.

DIANNE KLEIN: GOOD WILL TOWARD MEN GOES OUT WITH HOLIDAY TINSEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For as long as I've known him, my husband always has made the same New Year's 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
He folds his arms in front of his chest and, his voice dripping with disgust, 
declares, "I'm not sending out any Christmas cards next year." 
</P>
<P>
Never mind this business about spreading holiday cheer, or even seizing the 
moment to drop a quick line to far-flung friends. 
</P>
<P>
My husband is a sensitive guy. Every unrequited Christmas card is like a dagger 
to his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Scratch those (expletive deleted) off the list," he says. "They didn't send us 
one this year." 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Christmas tree has been reduced to a mere fire hazard, the See's 
candy is picked over and our daughter has scattered Santa's spoils everywhere, 
the annual post-holiday harangue has begun. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't wait to rush out and return them, could you?" my mother was 
telling me during our quality time together between Christmas and New Year's. 
</P>
<P>
We were talking about the necklaces she had so thoughtfully picked out as gifts 
for my sister and me. We took them back Dec. 26, and so as not to hurt my 
mother's feelings, we didn't bother her for the receipts. 
</P>
<P>
What we got was 30% off when my mother had paid full price. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, well, next year you're all just getting a check," says my mother. 
</P>
<P>
My husband, meantime, couldn't believe that I got him a shirt contaminated with 
polyester -- I admit the oversight -- or that tie with enlarged amoebas, read 
paisley. He took both back. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, that jacket and dress he bought me didn't work either. Returned. 
</P>
<P>
But I don't want you to get the wrong idea about my family. We are really very 
loving toward each other, and some of us even have a strikingly noble world 
view. 
</P>
<P>
My cousin, for example, was sizing up her childrens' toy collection, which is 
vast and unappreciated. Soon it would grow even larger, thanks to Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
Enough is enough, she thinks, so she calls her two sons, one of them age 2 and 
the other, 5, to her side. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, there are a lot of little boys and girls who don't have toys," my 
cousin explains. "These boys and girls are poor. Wouldn't it be nice to give 
these children some of your toys?" 
</P>
<P>
The two boys nod their heads, their eyes big as Moon Pies, and keep listening. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I want you to go upstairs and pick out eight nice toys that you don't play 
with anymore," my cousin says. "And then we can give them to the boys and girls 
who don't have toys." 
</P>
<P>
No problem. The boys agree that would be a smashing idea. The little one takes 
off like a rocket and comes back loaded down with toys -- all of them belonging 
to his brother. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, none of this bothers me. All of these incidents took place in the 
'80s, the Greed is Great decade that gave us Ivan Boesky, Madonna and a slew of 
slicked-backed Gordon Gekko imitators. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990s, or so I read, will be a decade of down-to-earth practicality and 
common sense values. Clothes will be simple, slouchy and comfortable. Anybody 
who's anybody will have a highly developed environmental consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
So in the common sense decade, millions of hip Americans will undoubtedly 
follow the lead of a friend of mine, a man ahead of his time in many ways, 
someone who realized long ago that unwanted gifts only add to our nation's 
horrendous landfill dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
In a bold break with tradition, my friend and his brother embarked on a 
Christmas shopping expedition to their favorite ski shop to buy the other a 
pre-approved gift. 
</P>
<P>
My friend picks out a $50 pair of pants, his brother, a $150 pair of boots. 
Realizing the inequity of the situation, the brother suggests that my friend 
contribute $50 to the boots while he would buy the $50 pants. Terrific. 
</P>
<P>
So they're standing in line at the cash register, when the obvious takes hold. 
They should each just buy themselves a Christmas gift. 
</P>
<P>
They've been doing it that way for about 10 years now, although in a quaint 
anachronism, they still wrap their own gift and place it under the tree. "Love, 
your brother," the tags read. 
</P>
<P>
"You should see the nice jacket he got me this year," my friend says. "Just the 
right color, and fits like a glove."

Count Results -- Last Sunday's coastal bird count tallied 195 species 
unofficially (a few reports still need to be confirmed). That falls short of 
last year's count of 201 and well behind the record-setting count of two years 
ago, which enumerated 214 species. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it's not bad, according to Doug Willick of the Sea &amp; Sage chapter of 
the National Audubon Society, especially considering counts were generally in 
the 170s just a few years ago. "We have done better, but it's still pretty 
high," Willick said. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal count for Orange County will still probably rank among the top 10 
in the nation. So far, the national winner looks like Freeport, Texas, with a 
reported 226 species, with Santa Barbara leading the state with 205. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's coastal count was lower than in the last two years for sea 
birds and especially waterfowl. One theory for the decrease in waterfowl, 
Willick said, is that the mild winter is allowing the birds to winter farther 
north. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of unusual sightings, however. Among the bird species 
spotted: black and white warbler, American redstart, palm warbler, northern 
waterthrush, summer tanager, chestnut-colored longspur, orchard oriole, 
Baltimore oriole, swamp sparrow, clay-colored sparrow, oldsquaw, mountain 
bluebird, peregrine, merlin, prairie falcon, eastern phoebe, vermilion 
flycatcher and white pelican. 
</P>
<P>
This year's inland count tallied a record 166 species on Dec. 17. Among the 
unusual sightings: Lucy's warbler, Lapland longspur, Scott's oriole, sage 
thrasher (the first county sighting in eight years) and lewis woodpecker. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 30, the day before the coastal count, a tree swallow was spotted at 
Ralph B. Clark Regional Park in Buena Park, the first county sighting on 
record. The bird was still at the park as recently as Friday.

BONE MARROW VOLUNTEERS MISS MATCH BUT MAY YET SAVE A LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When about 1,000 Orange County residents gave blood samples last fall in a 
search for a bone marrow donor for a Brea teen-ager suffering from leukemia, 
the chances were slim that a suitable match would be found. 
</P>
<P>
Tests turned up no matches between those who offered to donate and 17-year-old 
Brandon Oba. 
</P>
<P>
But those who volunteered weren't wasting their time. Preliminary tests show 
that they may help save the lives of some of the estimated 9,000 other patients 
nationwide in need of similar transplants. 
</P>
<P>
Their samples were entered into a national computer registry of patients with 
leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease or other blood disorders, and preliminary 
tests showed that three dozen of those offering to help Oba had tissue types 
that matched other patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's likely that we'll have virtually all saving a life within a 
couple of weeks," said Dr. Rudolf L. Brutoco, Covina pediatrician and founder 
of the Life-Savers Foundation, which raises money for testing and helps recruit 
donors. ". . . We expect all 1,000 to save a life. It doesn't have to be 
Brandon. It can be someone they never heard of before." 
</P>
<P>
This happened in Brandon's case. He is scheduled to receive a bone marrow 
transplant in about a week from a donor in Minnesota. The donor, who was found 
through the registry, was confirmed in November as a match. Brandon will enter 
UCLA Medical Center on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Bone marrow transplants are one of the most successful treatments for victims 
of a chronic form of leukemia, which destroys the marrow cells in which blood 
cells grow and develop. 
</P>
<P>
Marrow, a tissue found within the bones, manufactures blood cells and 
antibodies. Each individual's bone marrow is a particular type, known as an HLA 
type, for human leukocyte antigens. There are thousands of different HLA types, 
which are determined by markers found on the surface of white blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
Before the transplant, Brandon will undergo chemotherapy to kill cancer cells 
in his body, Brutoco said. At the same time, healthy cells also are killed, 
requiring the replenishment of the body's bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
During the transplant, marrow tissue will be surgically extracted from a 
donor's hip bone and transplanted into Brandon's body. After the transplant, he 
will be isolated for several weeks because his body's immune system will have 
been weakened, said Dr. Alfred Grovas, a UCLA Medical Center pediatric 
hematologist. 
</P>
<P>
For Brandon and members of his family, the search for the donor and wait for 
the transplant has been grueling. But his father, Steve, said this was all they 
could do. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if there's any choice," Steve Oba said. The procedure was delayed 
until this month so Brandon could spend the holidays at home. 
</P>
<P>
He said that his son, a senior at Brea-Olinda High School and a member of the 
wrestling team, was in good shape but was home from school because he was too 
distracted by the upcoming transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little hard to concentrate on your studies," said Brandon's mother, 
Karen Oba. "You just got to emotionally gear up." 
</P>
<P>
Grovas said Brandon's spirits are high about the upcoming transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"Brandon's a pretty tough kid," Grovas said. "I know he's going into this fully 
aware of the risks and procedure. But I'm sure he's going into this with a 
positive attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Brandon's transplant from an unrelated person -- reportedly the 275th such 
transplant since 1987 -- is still a relatively new procedure, Grovas said. The 
process is needed because only 40% of those who need transplants have relatives 
with the same tissue type, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon's chances of full recovery are about 50%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, employees at St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in 
Fullerton and Brea Community Hospital, along with area residents, turned out to 
give blood samples as part of an attempt to find a suitable donor for Brandon. 
The drive at Brea Community Hospital also was to seek donors for 17-year-old 
Anissa Ayala of Walnut. She still is trying to find a donor. 
</P>
<P>
The drives were coordinated by Life-Savers, which helped pay the $75 cost of 
testing each potential donor. The test results were then sent to the registry, 
part of the National Marrow Donor Program based in St. Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which is funded by the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, 
Md., has a catalogue of about 73,000 potential donors, said Pam Weinberg, a 
spokeswoman for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Marrow Donor Program doesn't have the money to pay for recruiting 
and testing donors, Life-Savers has helped pick up a lot of the slack, Weinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made a significant contribution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Potential donors are typically 18 to 55 years old, in good health, with no 
history of AIDS, hepatitis or cancer other than simple skin cancers. Testing is 
simple, requiring only a blood sample. 
</P>
<P>
But those who believe that they will match a particular patient might be 
holding false hopes. The odds of finding a suitable donor through such means 
are no higher than 1 in 20,000, McCurdui said. About 25 transplants due to 
matches made through the registry are now performed each month, said Pam Quam, 
another spokeswoman for the Marrow Donor Program. 
</P>
<P>
Patients will resort to taking their case before the public even though their 
chance of success is slight. 
</P>
<P>
"What choices do you have?" said Dr. Robert Gale of UCLA Medical Center. "It's 
otherwise incurable. There is no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
There's also the chance -- as with the 36 Orange County residents -- that 
potential donors from these drives will match other patients, even years from 
now. Those who rallied for Brandon were told that their test results would be 
placed in the registry, Brutoco said. 
</P>
<P>
He was unsure when he would know if 36 potential donors who matched would pass 
further tests preparatory to a transplant because their identities are kept 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the drives didn't find a donor for Brandon, Brutoco said, the 
important thing is that one was found in the end. Brutoco is very optimistic of 
his full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be back in time for his high school graduation," he said, "and be 
leukemia-free."

HUNTING FOES PICKET ANNUAL SPORTS SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: ANIMAL RIGHTS GROUP OUTSIDE ANAHEIM CONVENTION CENTER CALLS FOR AN 
END TO HUNTING. BUT THE PROTESTS DO NOT APPEAR TO DAMPEN THE SPIRITS OF THE 
ENTHUSIASTS.

<P>
Ross McHenry and Mike Popp displayed pictures of dead wildlife Saturday at the 
25th annual Anaheim Sports, Vacation and RV Show, but the two could not be 
further apart on the issue of hunting. 
</P>
<P>
McHenry, one of more than 50 protesters outside the Anaheim Convention Center, 
waved posters of dead animals in a call for an end to hunting in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Popp was inside the convention hall, showing pictures and videotapes of animals 
killed by hunters at his Idaho ranch in an attempt to get outdoors enthusiasts 
to vacation there. 
</P>
<P>
The protest, which organizers said was one of the largest of its kind in the 
county, did not appear to dampen the spirits of the thousands of the people who 
attended the first day of the show. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators passed out flyers and carried placards with slogans such as 
"Hunters Need Guns to Prove They're Men." One protester wore a skeleton mask. 
</P>
<P>
While demonstrators occasionally exchanged words with people entering the show, 
the protest was peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to stop the carnage," said Wanda Ballard, a protester from Anaheim. 
"I'm trying to get through to the children -- to get through the brainwashing 
and the tradition of killing." 
</P>
<P>
Organizers said they chose to picket the show because of the many private 
wilderness ranches that advertise hunting vacation packages and stress the 
number of animals one can kill as a selling point. 
</P>
<P>
The protest was organized by the animal rights group Hunt Saboteurs in 
conjunction with six other organizations in Los Angeles and Orange County. It 
marks the third consecutive year the groups have picketed the show. 
</P>
<P>
But their views were not shared by many inside the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're naive," said Popp, manager of Flying B Ranch in Kamiah, Ida. 
"We have more deer and elk in the U.S. today than ever before. A lot of the 
natural predators are extinct. Without hunting, we would see overpopulation and 
disease."

Popp's exhibit was along a row of similar booths marked by towering antlers 
protruding from several mounted animal heads on display.

"I don't even pay attention to (the demonstrators). I don't like them," said 
hunter Tom Engle of Anaheim as he adjusted his cowboy hat. "They better not ask 
me what I think."

<P>
Not far from the hunting ranch area was the National Rifle Assn. booth, where 
NRA field representative Fred Romero defended the right to hunt. 
</P>
<P>
"No one respects the animal more than the hunter," said Romero, who noted that 
hunters pay 90% of the cost for wildlife management projects through a tax on 
guns and ammunition.

The Sports, Vacation and RV Show runs through Jan. 14. About 600 exhibitors of

getaways are attending the show, which is expected to draw 100,000 during its 
run.

DONATION OF HISTORIC RANCH GIVES CSUF A RECORD YEAR: $5.5 MILLION

A sprawling 4.5-acre ranch, once owned by a pioneer Orange County family and 
donated to Cal State Fullerton for the president's home, topped the list of 
gifts to the school in 1989 -- its best year for private fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
The property, which is worth about $2.2 million, is on the 200 block of West 
Union Avenue in Fullerton and was once owned by the late C. Stanley Chapman, 
the son of the founder of Chapman College. The donation in June by Chapman's 
children through the El Dorado Foundation helped push the university to a total 
of about $5.5 million in donations -- an 83% increase from 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Other gifts of equipment, as well as money for scholarships and for an endowed 
chairmanship, made up most of remainder, according to a report to be presented 
to the Cal State University Board of Trustees on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We received some very large gifts last year, and we are all very excited about 
the possibilities," said Anthony A. Macias, vice president for university 
relations and development at the Fullerton campus. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money came from businesses. Individual donations also made up a 
large part of the total, but contributions from alumni lagged, university 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The El Dorado Ranch, which features a two-story, 5,792-square-foot house and a 
tennis court, was also the largest donation ever from a foundation to the Cal 
State system. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a wonderful addition to the the arsenal of things we have to attract and 
hold quality presidents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The house will also be used by the president to host a number of functions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity for the university to become more involved in the 
community," Macias said. 
</P>
<P>
Another sizable gift came from Apple Computer Inc., which donated to the School 
of Natural Science and Mathematics $250,000 worth of equipment to establish a 
computer lab. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell International Corp. made the second of two $150,000 contributions to 
underwrite the school's first endowed professorship in the School of 
Engineering and Computer Science. It is only the second engineering endowment 
in the Cal State system. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was 1989 a record year for Fullerton, but also for the 20-campus Cal 
State system, which collected more than $66 million in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of total dollars, we're doing very well," said Robert D. Maners, the 
system's executive director for University Development. 
</P>
<P>
Maners said most of the contributions are coming from corporations. 
</P>
<P>
"We do well in corporation gifts because this is where they get their people," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maners said that Fullerton will receive an award Jan. 29 from the Cal State 
chancellor for its fund-raising success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really happy for Fullerton right now," Maners said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton had the fifth-highest donation total of all the campuses and the 
fourth-greatest percentage increase from the previous year, according to the 
annual report on "Voluntary Giving." 
</P>
<P>
One area in which all the Cal State campuses fell short of expections was 
alumni contributions, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not too hot in alumni giving to the schools," Maners said. "Nobody 
cared about tracking their alumni a while back, so we don't have their 
addresses and we can't solicit them. . . . It's a numbers game, and Fullerton 
has that problem too."

FOES OF ORANGE DEVELOPMENT GATHER SIGNATURES

Several residents who live near the site of a proposed residential and hotel 
development in east Orange said they collected about 500 signatures Saturday in 
their effort to put the issue on the city's June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the Irvine Co.'s 12,300-home project at Chapman Avenue and Newport 
Boulevard manned petition tables in front of two supermarkets in the area and 
canvassed neighborhoods in search of signatures. 
</P>
<P>
They need to collect 5,500 signatures by Jan. 18 to let the voters decide 
whether to accept or reject the development. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are responding to what we're doing," said Orange resident 
Terri Sargeant, who was accepting petition signatures at a Vons supermarket on 
Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
After 3 1/2 years of negotiations, the Orange City Council voted unanimously 
Dec. 19 to amend the city's General Plan and approve the development. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, when several homeowners held a news conference to express their 
support for the development, a shouting match erupted between them and 
opponents. Before it ended, supporters accused opponents of using "outside 
anti-growth leaders" to help block the development. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters said they favor the project because it includes jogging and horse 
trails and two parks. 
</P>
<P>
About half a dozen project opponents circulated petitions Saturday. They claim 
the 7,100-acre development will cause severe traffic problems, worsen air 
quality and rob residents of a prime piece of open space. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents will step up their effort in the final weeks of the petition drive 
and may employ mass mailings, said Sherry Meddick, a referendum supporter.

TITANS LET ONE SLIP AWAY AGAINST UTAH ST.; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: OPPORTUNITIES ARE LOST, ONE BY ONE, AND FULLERTON AGAIN 
COMES UP A LOSER IN LOGAN, 83-82, IN OVERTIME.

LOGAN, Utah 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton's players walked, straight-faced, off the court one by one 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They had a 13-point lead in the second half against Utah State, and they lost 
it. They had the ball and a two-point lead with two minutes left, and they lost 
that, too. 
</P>
<P>
They had the ball with 19 seconds left and the score tied, but came away empty 
when Van Anderson missed the front end of a one-and-one with seven seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton let every last opportunity get away. The Titans had the game against 
Utah State in hand, but they lost it, 83-82, in overtime in front of 8,624 in 
the Spectrum. Kendall Youngblood won it by hitting a leaning jumper in the lane 
with six seconds left in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Williams tried a desperation 19-footer as time ran out, but drew only 
air. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans' undefeated record after five games is long gone, replaced by a 6-5 
mark after a 1-5 stretch on the road, during which they have lost to Colorado 
State, UCLA, Wyoming, Nevada Las Vegas and Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those games they weren't likely to win -- games against nationally 
ranked UCLA and UNLV. Granted, they weren't supposed to lose them by 12 and 28 
points, either. A 29-point loss to Colorado State was a bit easier to take 
after the Rams upset North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
But this one was harder to handle. 
</P>
<P>
"Certain games I thought we had a much better chance of winning than others," 
Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "This was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies are traditionally tough in Logan, where Fullerton has not won since 
the 1981-82 season, but this year's team was picked to finish eighth in the Big 
West Conference. It looked like a good time to be here. 
</P>
<P>
For 35 minutes or so, it was for the Titans. Sneed called their first half 
their best of the year on the road. 
</P>
<P>
With 8:46 left in regulation, Fullerton had its largest lead, 67-54. With six 
minutes left, the Titans still led, 73-62. 
</P>
<P>
Then it unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed with this loss. We played well the first 37 or 38 
minutes, but then we got tight," said Mark Hill, who scored 31 points, but like 
the other Titans, struggled down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
With 31 seconds left in overtime, Hill drove and drew a foul. He made the first 
free throw, his 14th in a row. But he missed the second, one of only two misses 
in 16 tries. That one miss ended up being the margin of Fullerton's defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Utah State (8-6 overall, 2-1 in conference) cut into Fullerton's 11-point lead 
by running off six points in a row. 
</P>
<P>
After Cedric Ceballos hit one of two free throws, Sean Lake hit a three-pointer 
that brought the Aggies to within 74-71. Williams hit a driving layup, but Jeff 
Perris scored underneath and was fouled by Ceballos. The free throw made it 
76-74 with 2:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
Neither team scored again until 51 seconds remained, when Darrel White knocked 
down a 16-foot jumper to tie the score for the first time since 8-8. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton held the ball till 19 seconds remained, and took a timeout. Hill took 
a shot from outside with about nine seconds left, but missed. Anderson came up 
with the rebound and was fouled. He missed the free throw, his fourth miss in 
seven attempts. Ceballos rebounded, but was called for traveling as he tried to 
control the ball -- a call that Fullerton disputed. Utah State missed a 
last-chance shot and Ceballos missed a length-of-the-court heave, sending the 
game to overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans had their chances in overtime, too. Hill missed the second of two 
free throws with 31 seconds left, leaving the score at 82-81. That set up 
Youngblood's shot and Utah State's victory, their eighth in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
Hill led Fullerton in scoring for the seventh time in the past eight games. 
Ceballos added 21 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton (6-5, 0-2) returns home for games against Fresno State and Pacific 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be all right," Hill said. "We'll get together and get back on track 
pretty soon, and they we'll be ready for the next road trip." 
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
John Sykes, a center who had not started the past three games because of an eye 
infection, started Saturday and scored the Titans' first four points. But he 
fouled out with 13 minutes left without scoring again. . . . Ron Caldwell, a 
reserve forward, was ill and did not dress for the game.

COMPETITORS LEAVE NATIONAL LUMBER IN NEED OF REPAIR; 
</P>
<P>
RETAILING: THE DO-IT-YOURSELF CHAIN HAS FALLEN BADLY BEHIND THE LARGER, 
NATIONAL OUTLETS, AND SEEMS TO BE ALL THUMBS SO FAR IN ITS ATTEMPTS TO RECOVER.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Sol Jaffee opened his used lumber store in Bellflower in 1942, Southern 
California was still a sleepy agricultural region. 
</P>
<P>
But World War II unleashed a powerful economic expansion that changed the 
region's complexion forever, and National Lumber and Supply was in a position 
to prosper. As an unprecedented postwar building boom turned orange groves into 
housing tracts, National Lumber thrived and gradually evolved into a chain of 
21 do-it-yourself hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, however, Fountain Valley-based National Lumber has proven 
less adept at reacting to changes in its market and has stumbled badly. 
Newcomers to the area, like Home Depot, Builders Square and HomeClub have 
changed the rules and National Lumber has had operating losses for the last 
five years. In fiscal 1989, National Lumber watched its annual revenue fall for 
the first time in the company's history. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts in the last year to restore profitability have so far met with little 
success, making it unclear how the chain will be able to recover as it moves 
into the new decade. Industry observers and analysts suggest that National 
Lumber must make bold changes in its marketing and management if it is to 
regain its market. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't pay attention to the changes. But that's easy to do if 
everything's gone well for decades," said Ward Lindenmayer, who once followed 
the company for the brokerage firm Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco. Like most 
other investment analysts, Lindenmayer lost interest in the company as its 
performance deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
The company's condition has deteriorated since scoring record earnings of $2.1 
million in fiscal 1983. In fiscal 1989, which ended Jan. 31, 1989, National 
Lumber lost $4.6 million. For the first nine months of fiscal 1990, the loss 
was $4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
The decline has decimated the value of the company's stock. Offered to the 
public at $10 per share in 1983, shares have been worth as little as 87 1/2 
cents recently, and closed Friday at $1.25 in over-the-counter trading. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber was once a pioneer in the industry, being among the first 
retailers to develop into a full-service home improvement center and to expand 
beyond a single store. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Jaffee, son of Sol Jaffee and president of National Lumber since 1965, 
is widely credited with spearheading the company's expansion. National Lumber 
opened its second store in 1965, and added two more by the end of the decade 
including the first in Orange County. The chain added five stores in the 1970s 
and 13 more in the 1980s for a total of 22, all in Southern California. One 
store has since closed. 
</P>
<P>
The company made its first public offering in 1983 primarily to raise money for 
expansion, according to V.J. Carnevale, the company's chief financial officer. 
The offering raised $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
But as National Lumber was raising money to build more mid-size stores, the 
large national chains were planning their moves into Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
These chains recognized the rapid growth in the do-it-yourself and building 
industries, and opened 100,000-square-feet warehouses, crowding out the 
neighborhood hardware stores, lumber yards and regional home-decorating centers 
that had dominated the market for years. Industry leader Home Depot, based in 
Atlanta, opened its first California store in Orange County in 1985, and now 
has 19 stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California home-improvement retail market is estimated by industry 
executives to be worth as much as $5 billion a year. Nationally, home 
improvement industry sales were $107 billion in 1988, according to National 
Home Center News. 
</P>
<P>
The large retailers have located nearly side-by-side with smaller companies 
like National Lumber, whose stores average 60,000 square feet. The national 
chains can overpower their smaller rivals when it comes to variety, price and 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The results show in the stores' performance. For example, Home Depot, which has 
119 stores nationally, had sales of $289,000 per square foot at its stores in 
1988, an increase of 7.3% over a year earlier. For National Lumber, sales per 
square foot were $175,000 in fiscal 1989, a drop of 9%, and below the company's 
1981 level. 
</P>
<P>
The larger stores have also been more successful at managing inventory and 
costs. National Lumber finished installing a computerized inventory system last 
year, several years behind most retail chains, and four years after the 
installation began. 
</P>
<P>
When the large chains expanded most rapidly in the mid-1980s, National Lumber 
tried to remain the low-price leader, but at the expense of profits. By fiscal 
1989, gross margins improved, but the company was unable to bring in customers, 
and sales slipped from $159.3 million for fiscal 1988 to $152.4 million for 
fiscal 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In the company's annual report for fiscal 1989, Melvin Jaffee said National 
Lumber was making a number of major changes to boost sales, including a 
restructuring of store operations, redesign of advertising, in-store 
merchandising improvements and employee incentives. But stores have continued 
to do poorly, and for the first nine months of fiscal 1990, revenue lagged by 
8% over the year-earlier period, at $107.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Some industry analysts attribute the continuing problems in large part to the 
leadership style of 56-year-old Jaffee, described by one analyst as being 
"autocratical." 
</P>
<P>
Industry observers and a former National Lumber employee said the firm is run 
in a highly centralized style not uncommon to family-operated businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Jaffee, who earned $341,000 for fiscal 1989, owns 50% of the company's 
stock, and another 13% is held by a brother, Eugene Jaffee, who is not involved 
in the operation of the company. Sol Jaffee, now 83, is company chairman, but 
leaves company decision-making to his son. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee declined to be interviewed for this article. He said he plans to make a 
major announcement regarding the company's operations on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee's senior management team consists of Carnevale, 72, who joined as an 
employee in 1983, and had been the company's banker since 1962, and executive 
vice president Jordan G. Silverberg, 63, who has been with the company since 
1977. Craig R. Schumacher, 41, who was in charge of store operations, also 
worked closely with Jaffee until Schumacher resigned a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Other retailers in the industry rely on young managers for a great deal of 
input. At National Lumber, Mel Jaffee is clearly in charge," said Gary 
Ruderman, who writes on the company for National Home Center News, a trade 
journal based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a company in which store managers don't develop budgets or order 
merchandise without most decisions being made at the top," said a former 
National Lumber assistant store manager, who now works for another home 
improvement chain. 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber's longtime advertising campaign even bears Jaffee's stamp. 
Cartoon mascots Cheap Chicken and Shorty were created by Jaffee in the 1960s. 
The screechy-voiced characters, who use wit to pitch the stores' products, have 
given the company name identity with consumers. But the characters are 
criticized by executives in the ad industry as being not only amateurish and 
antiquated, but also ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
In November, National Lumber dismissed Stiller Advertising in Costa Mesa, the 
company's ad agency of record for the last four years. The company has not 
hired a new agency but has retained the mascots. 
</P>
<P>
Also during the fall, National Lumber dismissed its outside investor relations 
firm Clive Hoffman Associates Inc. in Los Angeles and the company ended a 
longtime credit relationship with Security Pacific National Bank in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In September, National Lumber signed an agreement for a $13-million line of 
credit with Fidelcor, a Pennsylvania-based company. The new line of credit, 
which National Lumber said carries a higher interest rate than the agreement 
with Security Pacific, is being used to open new stores, remodel existing ones 
and pay off $7 million in debt owed to Security Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Lindenmayer and other industry observers are skeptical that Jaffee will be 
willing to make enough changes, or give up some of his authority, to turn the 
company around. 
</P>
<P>
Other retailers have adapted to the competition from the national chains by 
closing stores, changing marketing strategies, or even selling their 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Builders Emporium, a chain of mid-size stores, tried unsuccessfully to compete 
with the mega-stores on price. The result was sharply reduced profits in 1987 
and 1988. But after a leveraged buyout the company undertook an extensive 
reorganization and in 1989 began to see improved sales. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had to make major changes and scrap a lot of old ideas," said John 
Kearney, executive vice president of the Irvine-based company, which operates 
most of its more than 100 stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We stepped back and decided not to compete on lumber and big building 
products. Instead, we'll be dominant in hardware, plumbing, home decor and the 
nursery." 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber must make similar significant marketing and merchandising 
changes if it hopes to revive its sales and earnings, said Wayne Hood, an 
analyst with New York-based Prudential-Bache research. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to focusing on high-margin items, National Lumber might seek to 
expand its share of specialty markets, such as building contractors or upscale 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Small retail chains in other parts of the country have been successful at 
selling to building contractors by opening early in the morning, and having 
separate entrances, and sales people for them, said Ann Marie Moriarty, an 
editor of Remodeling, a Washington-based magazine for contractors. 
</P>
<P>
In a shift from its longtime strategy of low prices, National Lumber in 
November opened a store in Oceanside that attempts to reach more upscale 
buyers. The store, which features a wide assortment of custom products, is to 
include a professional kitchen sales staff and in-house installation 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
While the upscale approach may become a prototype for new or existing stores, 
it remains to be seen whether such changes are enough to restore National 
Lumber's health in the face of competition that becomes more severe with every 
new home improvement warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hard Times At National Lumber 
</P>
<P>
National Lumber has lost money for six consecutive quarters. Competition from 
mega-stores like Home Depot has forced the company to consider newstrategies as 
it enters the 1990s.

FREEDOM NEWSPAPERS PLANNING A 24-HOUR LOCAL NEWS CHANNEL; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: ORANGE COUNTY CABLE NEWS WILL START FROM SCRATCH AND ATTEMPT TO 
ENTER ALL 400,000 COUNTY HOMES THAT SUBSCRIBE TO CABLE.

<P>
Orange County will have its own 24-hour local news channel by Labor Day, 
according to plans announced by Freedom Newspapers Inc., parent company of the 
Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
The company intends to hire television staffers and build studio facilities in 
the Register's Santa Ana building by summer. So far, three cable-system 
operators, covering about half the county's homes, have agreed to carry the 
service, according to Alan J. Bell, president of Freedom's broadcast division. 
The service will be called Orange County Cable News. 
</P>
<P>
While there would be some world and national coverage, the emphasis will be on 
Orange County news stories and features, which Bell said are given little play 
on Los Angeles television news programs. 
</P>
<P>
Stories will be repeated regularly during the day, probably at least once an 
hour; viewers can tune in and see a full newscast within a specified time, Bell 
said. There would be live coverage of major news events and some high school 
sports, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The channel represents a "partnership" with the Register, Bell said, and there 
will be some sharing of stories and resources. But OCCN will have its own 
news-gathering staff: "This is not simply a newspaper that is reading its 
columns on the air," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bell said Freedom hopes to make OCCN available in all 400,000 Orange County 
cable households, and to achieve that goal it will have to sign up Dimension 
Cable Services, which serves 106,000 of the households. 
</P>
<P>
Dimension is owned by Times Mirror, parent company of The Times, the Register's 
rival in the Orange County newspaper market. Bell said he is scheduled to meet 
with Dimension executives Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a very interesting process," Bell admitted. "I hope that we 
can get together despite the rivalry in other parts of our company." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Waterman, director of corporate affairs for Times Mirror Cable 
Television, said the Times-Register rivalry would have no influence on whether 
the Dimension systems would carry the Freedom service. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a very arms-length relationship between newspapers and cable 
television," he said. "We're looking at programming decisions based on what is 
best for our customers, not any relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Waterman added, however, that the company has had discussions with several 
other ventures that hope to offer an Orange County news service. 
</P>
<P>
Cable industry observers said local news currently is attracting a lot of 
interest. "From a cable operator's perspective, this would be very welcome," 
said Fred Dawson, a New York-based cable television consultant. He noted that 
the cable industry is often criticized for a lack of locally originated 
programming and that a local news service could help fill this gap. 
</P>
<P>
OCCN will be supported by advertising. But Dawson noted that rates for even a 
highly rated local cable show can be very low -- often as little as $100 for a 
30-second spot. "I don't see this as something that would give them a lot of 
profit, given the effort they have to mount," Dawson observed. "Maybe they can 
partially justify it as a marketing tool for the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
Bell declined to give start-up and operating costs and staffing figures for the 
new channel, except to call it a "multimillion-dollar" venture with a "sizable 
staff." The company expects to absorb operating losses in its first few years, 
he said. The channel, in both equipment and staff, is starting from scratch. 
"All that exists now is a plan," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Fein, news director at News 12 Long Island in New York, a 24-hour cable 
news venture launched in 1986, pegged the start-up cost for a quality, 
round-the-clock service at $8 million to $10 million, with operating expenses 
of $9 million to $12 million per year. He estimated that it would take at least 
five or six years for such a service to begin breaking even. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he praised the proposed service as "an excellent idea," noting that 
Orange County is in many respects similar to suburban Long Island. And he said 
Freedom might be able to gain additional efficiencies by selling advertising on 
the television news service in conjunction with advertising in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
News 12 Long Island, which serves 2.6 million people, is owned by Rainbow 
Program Enterprises, a 50-50 joint venture of cable operator Cablevision and 
the NBC television network. 
</P>
<P>
Cablevision owns most of the cable systems on Long Island, which Fein 
acknowledged made life easier for the news service by eliminating the need to 
negotiate agreements with multiple cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow is considering launching additional local news services in several 
cities later this year. 
</P>
<P>
KDOC Channel 56, the county's only commercial broadcast station, currently 
offers a half-hour nightly news program. It has announced plans to expand to 
three daily one-hour newscasts later this year. KCAL-TV Channel 9 in Los 
Angeles has said it will add more Orange County stories as part of a planned 
expansion of its daily newscasts.

SECURITIES INDUSTRY STRAINS IN MIDST OF UPHEAVAL; 
</P>
<P>
WALL STREET: BROKERS AND INVESTMENT BANKERS TIGHTEN BELTS, ALTER STRATEGIES TO 
COMBAT THE RECESSION THAT HAS ENGULFED THE INDUSTRY SINCE THE 1987 MARKET 
CRASH.

Richard B. Fisher, president of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., one of Wall Street's 
premier investment firms, stood on the trading floor one day watching a 
government bond trader at work in front of a bank of computers. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got 11 screens there. That's terrific," Fisher told the trader. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's not," the trader shot back. "Our customer has 12 screens." 
</P>
<P>
Fisher tells this story to document some of the vast changes taking place 
throughout the brokerage and investment business. 
</P>
<P>
When a Morgan Stanley customer has more information about the government bond 
market than the firm's traders, why would the client pay for Morgan Stanley's 
advice, Fisher asked. 
</P>
<P>
And if the investment organizations with giant pools of money will no longer 
support a brokerage firm's traditional bond trading operation, should the firm 
continue to run and even subsidize so costly an operation? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, Fisher said, is "no." Yet many firms put tradition ahead of profits 
and are unwilling to curtail marginal or losing operations while they hope for 
better times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the business cycle is going to bail us out," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Belt-tightening at both the institutional and retail levels was the theme of a 
recent meeting of the Securities Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers and investment bankers, from firms large and small, brought tales of 
layoffs, reorganization plans, consolidations and new sales efforts -- all 
intended to help them survive the recession that has engulfed the securities 
industry since the 1987 market crash. 
</P>
<P>
But the turmoil in the industry appears to be far from over. Fisher told his 
colleagues that despite all the cutbacks -- Wall Street employment has dropped 
by 33,000 jobs -- he believes that the industry still has 20% to 25% too many 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders attending the meetings here cited four events in the last two 
decades that have revolutionized the once placid business of buying and selling 
stocks and bonds and raising money for corporations: 
</P>
<P>
* The move from fixed commissions to negotiated commissions, which created the 
discount broker and price-cutting trader and sent more people chasing 
relatively fewer dollars. 
</P>
<P>
* The rise of the pension fund, which poured billions of dollars into stocks 
and bonds, replaced the individual as the dominant force in the market and 
opened the door to multimillion-dollar strategies such as program trading. 
</P>
<P>
* The development of electronic systems that created global markets in which 
all players get the same information at the same time and often buy and sell 
simultaneously, tilting the markets sharply. 
</P>
<P>
* The stock market crash of 1987, which accelerated the movement of individual 
investors away from stocks and toward fixed-income investments. 
</P>
<P>
While individual investors have turned away from risk, brokerage firms have had 
to increase their own risk-taking to replace the evaporating commission 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, commissions produced 61% of industry revenue. It has now dropped to 
17%. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey M. Schaefer, head of research for the SIA, observed that while 
commission revenue has slumped, there has been strong growth in the revenue 
that firms derive from trading for their own accounts, mostly bond trading. 
</P>
<P>
Another major area of revenue growth has come from the fees derived from merger 
and acquisition activity, as well as from the private sale of corporate stocks 
and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
But as some Wall Street firms found out, their high-risk activities can be 
costly when the market goes against them. Several firms have sustained major 
losses on municipal bond trading and mortgage-backed securities. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the retail investor eventually will go the way of the dodo bird is a 
subject of debate in the brokerage industry. 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, the individual is losing his grip on the world of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, stocks accounted for 36% of household financial assets. Today, 
the number is down to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, American stockholders held most of the shares of U.S. 
corporations. In 1965, they held 84% while institutions held 16%. Today, the 
gap has narrowed to 57%-to-43%. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals also account for a decreasing amount of the volume on the New York 
Stock Exchange. And yet, many brokers contend, the individual is still in the 
market but in a different way. Mutual funds, a minor factor 10 years ago, now 
hold almost $1 trillion of American savings. 
</P>
<P>
And more and more investors are putting money into corporate savings plans that 
also buy stocks. 
</P>
<P>
In conversations, brokers speak frequently of a "fear factor" that replaced the 
excitement of the five-year bull market. 
</P>
<P>
Just when brokers thought they saw investors regaining their courage, the 
market plunged 190 points on Oct. 13, again derailing investor confidence. 
</P>
<P>
James W. Brinkley, president of Legg Mason in Baltimore, finds it perplexing 
that investors remain so fearful of stocks. An investor who simply waited out 
the 1987 crash would have seen his stocks rebound nicely, Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Brinkley noted, his firm finds it difficult to attract new investors 
into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Two years after the market crash, investors "are concerned about whether the 
market is a safe place to be," said Joseph Hardiman, the head of the National 
Assn. of Securities Dealers, which runs the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
Rebuilding investor confidence is still an urgent necessity, Hardiman added.

SECURITIES: U.S. ATTORNEY OTTO G. OBERMAIER HAS DOUBTS ABOUT USING RICO IN 
INVESTMENT FRAUD CASES. AND HE HAS REPRESENTED WHITE-COLLAR DEFENDANTS HIMSELF.

<TEXT>
<P>
Otto G. Obermaier, the new U.S. attorney in Manhattan, bristles at suggestions 
that his appointment will mark a letup in the 4-year-old crackdown on Wall 
Street fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Before a reporter can even finish asking him what his new reign will mean for 
criminal prosecution of insider trading and securities fraud, Obermaier, 53, 
jumps in: 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing. It means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Obermaier is filling the shoes of Rudolph W. Giuliani, a zealous and 
publicity-hungry prosecutor who launched an unprecedented wave of criminal 
cases against major Wall Street figures before he stepped down last year to 
make a losing run at becoming New York City's mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani won praise for bringing law enforcement into an area that had become 
corrupt and for raising the standards of conduct on Wall Street. But by the end 
of his five-year tenure, Giuliani was also reviled by interests as diverse as 
the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page and the American Civil 
Liberties Union. The accusations included making promiscuous use of the harsh 
racketeering law, known as RICO, bringing criminal charges for offenses that 
previously had been handled only under civil law and ordering highly publicized 
arrests even though his office wasn't fully prepared to bring a case. 
</P>
<P>
Obermaier, by contrast, is regarded as a thoughtful, intellectual lawyer 
without political ambitions, described by one friend as more a diplomat than a 
crusader. He comes to the job after 19 years in private practice, much of it 
spent representing the type of white-collar defendants he now must prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
He is on record criticizing the use of RICO -- the Racketeer Influenced and 
Corrupt Organizations Act -- in securities fraud cases. In published articles, 
he has expressed doubts about whether insider trading cases should be 
prosecuted as criminal offenses. And his appointee to head the criminal 
division in his office, Gerard E. Lynch, 38, a former Columbia University law 
professor, was one of the most prominent scholarly critics of RICO, 
particularly its use in white-collar crime cases. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Obermaier's long tenure as a defense lawyer, current and former 
prosecutors praise him as a first-rate lawyer and say they don't doubt his 
commitment to tough prosecution. They note that, before he went into private 
practice in 1970, he was the chief trial lawyer in the Securities and Exchange 
Commission's New York office, and before that he was an assistant U.S. 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, many white-collar defense attorneys and other legal authorities 
in New York say they expect a change in approach under Obermaier. They expect 
more thoughtful consideration of specific charges before an indictment is 
brought. They also say it is probable that there won't be any flashy arrests 
designed for television cameras and that leaks about pending investigations may 
be less likely. 
</P>
<P>
John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia law professor and friend of Obermaier's, said he 
expects that under Obermaier there will be "a greater willingness to recognize 
that some kinds of misconduct are best dealt with through injunctions and civil 
penalties" rather than criminal indictments. 
</P>
<P>
Giuliani was widely criticized for bringing major felony charges against 
individuals who some claimed were guilty only of marginal infractions, and 
Coffee says that under Obermaier this may be less likely. But he predicts that 
Obermaier's term won't bring any relief for big-league crooks. Referring to 
former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and former investment banker Dennis B. 
Levine, both of whom pleaded guilty to insider trading-related charges, Coffee 
says: "I have no doubt that if you catch a new Boesky tomorrow, or a new Dennis 
Levine, he would indict them in a moment." 
</P>
<P>
Obermaier himself, as the man whose many duties include being the top federal 
cop on Wall Street, asserts that he is, in fact, contemplating no big changes 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Obermaier seems slightly ill at ease and reveals little about 
himself. He says that his office, the second-largest U.S. Attorney's Office in 
the country after the District of Columbia's, is a "proud institution." He 
adds: "One doesn't come into an institution and make dramatic changes." Asked 
what his personal priorities are as U.S. attorney, Obermaier asserts: "I don't 
have any." 
</P>
<P>
Obermaier also declines to respond in any detail to the main criticism of him 
as U.S. attorney -- the fact that his old law firm, Obermaier, Morvillo &amp; 
Abramovitz, represented so many prominent defendants in matters under 
investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office that he will have to "recuse" 
himself from a long list of cases -- that is, disqualify himself from having 
anything to do with them and turn supervision over to a subordinate. These 
include some of the office's biggest pending prosecutions. It was because of 
this that Giuliani initially opposed Obermaier's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Obermaier maintains that the recusals won't have any impact at all on how cases 
are managed. But the impact is unclear because Obermaier refuses to disclose 
how many cases he has recused himself from. A spokeswoman said: "It's not 
something he chooses to make available." 
</P>
<P>
It is known that Obermaier has disqualified himself from the big case pending 
against former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond chief Michael Milken, as 
well as from the pending real estate racketeering case against Imelda Marcos, 
wife of the late former Philippines president. One of his law partners had 
represented her co-defendant, Adnan M. Kashoggi. Obermaier himself for a time 
represented John A. Mulheren, who is due to go on trial soon on criminal 
securities fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Romatowski, a Washington securities lawyer who spent six years as an 
assistant federal prosecutor in New York, says Obermaier's recusals inevitably 
will hurt. Romatowski praises Obermaier but said the recusals mean he won't be 
able to have final say on which charges are brought, or negotiate plea 
agreements. "It's going to be a handicap," Romatowski said. "The public 
interest would be better served if Otto were in a position to participate." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases from which Obermaier has disqualified himself apparently will 
be supervised by Roger S. Hayes, who joined the office in November as chief 
deputy U.S. attorney after serving as a state court judge. Before he was a 
judge, Hayes worked in the Manhattan district attorney's office, and he served 
for a time as head of the trial division. But his only experience in the 
federal system was during law school, when he worked as a student intern in the 
U.S. attorney's office in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Knowledgeable sources said Hayes was given his new high-ranking job because his 
long association with the office of Manhattan District Atty. Robert Morgenthau 
will help Obermaier avoid turf battles with the city prosecutor. Such disputes 
had plagued the Giuliani years. 
</P>
<P>
Although Obermaier insists that he intends to change nothing about the office, 
at least one difference is already apparent. Obermaier has made clear that he 
has little interest in cultivating the press. Whereas Giuliani at times held 
two press conferences a day as U.S. attorney, Obermaier, who took office more 
than two months ago, has held none. 
</P>
<P>
Ira Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, says of 
Obermaier: "I don't see early on the same sort of taste for splashy stuff that 
Giuliani displayed almost from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Both Obermaier and Morvillo, his former partner, are on record challenging 
aspects of RICO, including the financial forfeiture provision, which they have 
suggested gives prosecutors too much power. And Obermaier, in a column on 
white-collar crime that appeared in the New York Law Journal in 1986, openly 
questioned the filing of criminal charges in some insider trading cases; he 
seemed to indicate that he wasn't personally convinced that insider trading 
should be considered a crime. 
</P>
<P>
Although he didn't take an explicit stand in the article, he noted that 
"insider trading is unique among crimes . . . in that responsible and respected 
scholarly opinions are held that it has no harmful effects on the securities 
markets." 
</P>
<P>
Obermaier asserts that whatever views he may have expressed earlier won't have 
any effect on how cases are handled. But on RICO, he does allow that "I think 
that every thinking person probably believes that the statute is a little bit 
on the broad side." 
</P>
<P>
The RICO controversy came to the fore in the Giuliani years because of its use 
in the case against Drexel Burnham and in a related case against a much smaller 
securities firm, Princeton/Newport Limited Partners. In the Princeton/Newport 
case, criticism centered on whether the racketeering law, originally enacted by 
Congress as a means of fighting organized crime, should be applied to what 
Giuliani's critics contended were only relatively minor tax law violations. 
</P>
<P>
In the Drexel case, some legal authorities raised the issue of whether the 
pretrial forfeiture of assets allowed under RICO forced the firm to settle the 
charges by pleading guilty to six criminal charges rather than by trying to 
exonerate itself in a trial. RICO, they charged, was being used as a bludgeon 
to force a company to plead guilty, since the forfeiture provision meant that 
the firm might go out of business even before a trial could be held. 
</P>
<P>
In the Princeton/Newport case, six defendants were ultimately convicted of 
racketeering offenses for temporarily transferring the ownership of stocks and 
bonds to claim illegal tax benefits. As it happened, Obermaier's firm 
represented one of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton/Newport did go out of business before a trial was held. Defense 
lawyers attributed this to the fact that prosecutors were able to freeze much 
of the firm's assets under RICO. But prosecutors received what was widely 
viewed as a sharp de facto rebuke when the judge who presided over the case 
sentenced the defendants to just a few months in prison and ruled that four of 
the defendants wouldn't have to forfeit any of their salary or profits from the 
partnership. This was in contrast with the lengthy sentences and heavy 
financial forfeiture permitted under RICO. The judge found that given the 
relatively minor nature of the offenses, anything harsher would have amounted 
to cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
Lynch, the new head of the criminal division, in a lengthy law review article 
published in 1987, challenged recent uses of RICO. In the article, titled 
"RICO: The Crime of Being a Criminal," one of his main criticisms was that the 
law could be interpreted so broadly that even minor offenses could be 
considered a pattern of racketeering activity. "Within the white-collar area, 
virtually any securities fraud or mail fraud case can be made as a RICO case," 
Lynch said in an interview. "There's nothing that prevents you from using it in 
fairly trivial, run-of-the-mill cases." 
</P>
<P>
But Lynch also said that his criticisms were based mainly on academic concerns 
and that, if anything, he has to be on guard against a personal bias against 
white-collar criminals. He also said it would be wrong to assume that, as a 
prosecutor, he won't make use of every available tool, including RICO. "It 
would be wrong to think that anybody, including me or Otto, is going in there 
with the attitude that we're going to do something different with RICO," Lynch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outward appearances indicate that the pace of major securities fraud 
indictments has slackened considerably since the heady days of 1987 and 1988. 
Then, using information obtained from Boesky, Giuliani and his staff brought 
charges against former Los Angeles brokerage chief Boyd L. Jefferies, 
investment banker Martin A. Siegel, corporate raider Paul A. Bilzerian, GAF 
Corp., Drexel and a slew of others. Lynch says that more than anything else, 
the pace of prosecutions has and will depend on what wrongdoing rank-and-file 
prosecutors stumble onto. 
</P>
<P>
As mandated last year by Congress, the U.S. attorney's securities fraud unit 
will soon receive several additional assistant prosecutors. For his part, Alan 
Cohen, head of the unit, said: "Whatever the numbers show, the fact is that we 
are investigating and prosecuting criminal activity in the securities and 
commodities markets as vigorously as we ever have." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Obermaier and his former partner are on record challenging aspects of RICO, 
including the financial forfeiture provision, which they have suggested gives 
prosecutors too much power. And Obermaier has openly questioned the filing of 
criminal charges in some insider trading cases.

RAMS: FOR AN OFFENSIVE LINEMAN, ALL-PRO GUARD GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Newberry, a 200-pound high school fullback who learned to pass-block at 
Wisconsin La Crosse, was named to another Pro Bowl by his NFL peers a couple of 
weeks ago. Then the nation's media made him an Associated Press All-Pro again. 
</P>
<P>
And as the Rams' playoff adventures continue, television commentators are 
helping transform the fourth-year guard into some sort of tough-guy cult hero. 
You can't watch a Ram game without hearing about the time Newberry knocked out 
four guys in under three minutes during a winner-take-all brawl-a-thon that 
resembled boxing only because it was staged in a ring. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams advance to the Super Bowl, Newberry undoubtedly will have expended 
more energy recounting his two nights of prize-fighting glory than he did 
decking those four guys. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it appears Newberry is plenty tough enough for the NFL. He's a bit 
small -- 6 feet 1 7/8 inches, to be exact -- for an offensive lineman, but when 
it comes to holding rampaging pass rushers at bay and blasting holes in 
defensive lines, few do it better. 
</P>
<P>
And he certainly hasn't wasted any time entrenching himself among the league's 
elite in the trenches. Today, when the Rams meet the New York Giants in their 
NFC divisional playoff game at Giants Stadium, Newberry will be making his 62nd 
start in the 64 games the Rams have played since drafting him in the second 
round in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 4, he will be in Honolulu, making his second consecutive Pro Bowl 
appearance. And he will surely be a consensus All-Pro for the second year in a 
row. After just four seasons, Newberry has built a reputation as one of the 
league's finest offensive linemen, playing a position that is difficult to 
master quickly. Like quarterbacks, offensive linemen usually require seasons of 
experience to become adroit at the intricacies of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
So how did a guy who's too small and attended a too-small school on a small 
academic scholarship make such a big hit in the big time? 
</P>
<P>
Probably because he's small, smart, and that little college's football program 
never abbreviated when it came to the fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yeah, lest we forget, Tom Newberry is a real tough guy. 
</P>
<P>
WHO'S THE LITTLE ONE? 
</P>
<P>
Former Ram guard Dennis Harrah and his wife, Teresa, are proud parents of a 
one-week-old baby boy, Blake Edward, eight pounds, 12 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
"We would've named him Tom," Harrah said, "but he was too tall. Heck, the kid 
was four hours old and he was taller than Newberry." 
</P>
<P>
Harrah is 3,000 miles away from Ram Park, home on the range of his West 
Virginia farm, but he still never misses a chance at taking a short shot in 
Newberry's direction. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so small, he's only six inches taller than a reporter," Harrah said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams call Newberry "Weebles," after the childrens' toy, small pear-shaped 
characters who have no arms or legs. 
</P>
<P>
No arms? Newberry has the wingspan of a man who's 6-foot-7, and at 285 pounds, 
he can still dunk a basketball with two hands. 
</P>
<P>
No legs? The man's thighs look like columns on the steps of a building in Rome. 
He pulled his hamstring while water-skiing in Florida last summer, and it's a 
good thing it didn't snap. Someone could have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
"We give him a hard time about being the shortest guy on the line," said Jim 
Everett, Newberry's roommate on the road, "but he's got a combination of great 
leverage and great strength." 
</P>
<P>
Harrah said Newberry is built like "a swollen spider monkey," but the Ram guard 
looks more like a bear than any other animal in the forest. And when he walks 
by, you get the urge to climb the nearest tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I guess he's perfect for what he's doing," Harrah said. "His arms 
hang on down below his knees and his head will meet most people right in their 
chest. Perfect for what he does for a living." 
</P>
<P>
Newberry said he was always powerful for his size, even when he was an 
180-pound, 6-1, 14-year-old at Onalaska High School in Onalaska, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always in three or four sports and I wasn't really that big, but I was 
always pretty strong for my size," he said. "And I always ran well." 
</P>
<P>
His extended reach helped him in high school basketball games. Now, it's 
helping him reach the heights as a guard in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps to have long arms when you're pass-blocking," he said. "You can lock 
out on people and keep them away from you. That's one of the main problems of 
being short. If you don't have real long arms, people can get to your body on 
the pass rush." 
</P>
<P>
Everett thinks Newberry is doing just fine at keeping things at arm's length. 
He points out that he seldom has had to "smell the breath" of anyone Newberry 
was blocking the past couple of years. So he has no qualms about going out with 
his roommate for Italian food and getting a bit of garlic on his own breath. 
</P>
<P>
Newberry is a self-made hulk and his passion is pasta. 
</P>
<P>
"The night before the game, we always go somewhere and have Italian food," 
Newberry said. "It's both tradition and superstition now. But you've got to get 
those carbohydrates." 
</P>
<P>
Newberry is merely maintaining his physique these days. In college, he was 
building the bulk, and, well, growing boys need nourishment. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was oriented toward gaining weight, I'd eat 10,000 calories a day -- 
fruit, pasta, eggs," he said. "If I was short at the end of the night, I'd make 
a shake with a dozen raw eggs in it." 
</P>
<P>
He gained 90 pounds in four years at Wisconsin La Crosse. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom's got all the physical potential to be one of the best offensive linemen 
to ever play the game," Harrah said. "He's not only got the potential, he's 
hard-headed enough to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want him to operate on me, I mean he's no brain surgeon, but he has 
adapted as quick as anyone in terms of learning his plays and knowing how to 
get his job done." 
</P>
<P>
But how smart can a guy be if he drinks a dozen raw eggs before bed? 
</P>
<P>
SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR 
</P>
<P>
The Rams picked Newberry after they selected offensive tackle Mike Schad, who 
has just now found a starting job -- with the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Until his contract was renegotiated in 1988, Newberry, already a fixture at 
left guard, was making less money than Schad, who was still considered a 
"project" by the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams knew they were getting a lot of guard for the money from the 
outset with Newberry. They were so high on the rookie that they traded 
five-time Pro-Bowl guard Kent Hill to Houston in a deal that gave the Rams the 
rights to Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Supposedly, Newberry was so impressive in one exhibition game against Denver 
that the Rams were convinced he could start. 
</P>
<P>
"Dennis (Harrah) took a game off, I played the whole game and played really 
well, for a rookie anyway," Newberry said in a matter-of-fact manner. "And 
that's when they felt they could afford to trade Kent Hill away." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the Rams were just as impressed with Newberry's poise and grasp of 
his assignments as with his considerable physical talents. While others 
marveled at the country boy's savvy, Newberry landed in the big leagues and the 
big city with a yawn. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I wondered if I'd be able to play in this league," he said, "but after 
just a few days in training camp, I knew I could play. 
</P>
<P>
"I started four years in college at guard and I had enough time to learn the 
position. And the coaching here is really good. They did a good job of getting 
me ready in training camp." 
</P>
<P>
With his agent hinting that he might pursue a boxing career, Newberry staged a 
short holdout during his first training camp, but it hardly retarded his 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a playbook home with me when I was holding out," he said, "and I 
learned as much as I could every day." 
</P>
<P>
Former Ram Tom Mack had taken a young Harrah into tow and guided him through 
his rookie season. Offensive linemen -- Harrah calls them "pie faces" -- are a 
close-knit group, and Harrah, in the waning years of his career, wanted to 
maintain the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
He lifted his wing for Newberry but this bird wasn't seeking shelter. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom Mack helped me adapt to the surroundings, and I wanted to pass that on 
before I left," Harrah said. "You know, coaches are always yelling at you and 
you have to try to hold it in and not yell back. Things like that. 
</P>
<P>
"But Newberry did most of it on his own," he said, sounding genuinely 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
Newberry said: "It was an adapt-or-die situation. Sure, there was culture 
shock, but that was just one more thing I had to ignore. You have to ignore all 
the outside things." 
</P>
<P>
So he kept his eyes on the guy across the line of scrimmage and his mind on the 
business at hand and earned a spot on the most-decorated offensive line in 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the learning curve in any job is different for different people," Ram 
Coach John Robinson said. "And obviously, Tom is a quick study. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in here with great physical tools, balance and explosiveness, and, 
although his college background wasn't Division I, I still think he must have 
had good coaching. The big thing is he got an opportunity to play early. We 
traded Kent Hill right away and that forced Tom into playing, and that's when 
you make progress. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a smart guy. And he's a tough guy." 
</P>
<P>
SUNDAY PUNCHES ON SATURDAY NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
As far as his teammates and much of the rest of the Wisconsin State University 
Conference were concerned, Tom Newberry could have been crowned the Toughest 
Man in La Crosse long before they held that contest in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom was always a bright young man, but he's also very aggressive," La Crosse 
Coach Roger Harring said. "Those two attributes, matched in with the obvious 
athletic skills, have served him well. 
</P>
<P>
"On Wednesdays during his senior year, he would usually miss practice because 
he had a class. And when he wasn't there, a somewhat looser attitude prevailed. 
But if there was a pro scout around and he came out, you could hear all the 
chin straps buckle at the same time when they saw Tom run out of the locker 
room." 
</P>
<P>
Newberry was all-everything at Wisconsin La Crosse and, not surprisingly, a 
dominating force on small-college football fields. 
</P>
<P>
"When he'd block people on the pulling-type plays, he'd patty-cake them, knock 
them clean off their feet and flat on the back of their heads," Harring said. 
"He used to watch film and count patty-cakes. He liked that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Newberry, who worked as a bouncer in a saloon for four years, knew they 
wouldn't be playing patty-cake at La Crosse's downtown civic auditorium that 
night in March, 1985. He had no real skill -- or ambition, for that matter -- 
when it came to boxing, but he entered the town's Toughest Man contest for a 
good reason. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed the money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Newberry used his brains before his brawn. He worked a deal with 
backers of the event. They could use his name to promote the fight, and he got 
30 ringside seats worth $20 each. 
</P>
<P>
Two minutes 11 seconds of brawling after the opening round, he picked up 
another $1,500 for winning the event. 
</P>
<P>
One opponent lasted just seven seconds. The longest bout lasted 1:15. For some 
reason, the guy got up three times after Newberry knocked him down. 
</P>
<P>
"There were four fights, one on Friday night and three on Saturday night, and I 
(competed in) a track meet Saturday morning," he said. "My track coach didn't 
like it very much but he knew about it. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no boxing involved. I didn't let anybody box. I just went right 
after them." 
</P>
<P>
Newberry's preference for seizing the initiative is still helping him these 
days. He would much rather run-block than pass-block, because he can unleash 
his aggressive instincts, but he's satisfied to do his part in helping the Rams 
win . . . even if they insist on focusing on this wimpy passing game. 
</P>
<P>
"An offensive lineman's job is totally controlled aggression," Harrah said, 
"and a defensive lineman's is totally uncontrolled aggression. When you play 
(guard), you have to know when to turn it on and when not to. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has had a good handle on that since the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE A SCHOOL WITH A CITY AFTER ITS NAME 
</P>
<P>
Forget Notre Dame and USC and all those schools in Florida. Want a sure route 
to the NFL? Well, Wisconsin La Crosse worked for Newberry, and maybe it's not a 
fluke. 
</P>
<P>
During his first year in college, Newberry, who was the NCAA Division III 
shotput and discus champion in 1984 and '85, didn't play football, being 
content with his career in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
But his track and field coach, Mike Sanders, was also the offensive line coach 
and talked him into giving football another try. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike was a really, really good strength coach, and I was up to 230 (pounds) by 
the time I went out for football," Newberry said. "I started at guard right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
But football is not a 24-hours-a-day existence for a player at Wisconsin La 
Crosse, and maybe less can sometimes yield more in the development of a player. 
</P>
<P>
"Granted, it's quite unusual for a guy to go from a Division III situation to 
the NFL," Harring said, "but we are fundamentally sound here. And a lot of kids 
come from Division I programs and they're kind of burned out from all the film 
sessions and all the constant control of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom was able to do two sports and develop more fully because of the two 
sports. I think throwing the shot, discus and hammer helped his overall 
agility. And I think all the different competitive situations he's been in have 
helped him prepare for a career in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Newberry popped up in the NFL well-equipped to knock 'em down and 
throw 'em around, yet mature enough to turn down the intensity level when he is 
away from the field. 
</P>
<P>
Just don't get in his way if he's headed for the noodle section at the 
supermarket. The guy is one tough customer.
