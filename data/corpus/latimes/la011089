New York City is planning to throw a big anniversary party for George 
Washington. In fact, Mayor Edward I. Koch promised that the ceremonies to mark 
the 200th anniversary of the inauguration of the nation's first President will 
be "bigger, bigger, bigger" than other recent celebrations, including the 
centennial tribute to the Statue of Liberty in 1986. "This is the most 
appropriate place to celebrate this historic anniversary, because New York City 
was the first capital of the United States under the Constitution," Koch said 
at a news conference in Federal Hall, where Washington was sworn in on April 
30, 1789, and where Congress met for the first time. Organizers have invited 
President Reagan, President-elect Bush and former Presidents Jimmy Carter, 
Gerald R. Ford and Richard M. Nixon to attend the observance on April 29 and 
30. Events will include fireworks, a parade of 13 Navy and Coast Guard ships 
representing the original colonies, an ecumenical service in St. Paul's Chapel 
on Lower Broadway, where Washington attended religious services after his 
inauguration, a parade up Broadway and an inaugural gala dinner.

 -- Young Stormie Jones, the world's first recipient of a simultaneous heart 
and liver transplant, was reported to be in good condition after a checkup at 
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pa. Stormie, 11, of White Settlement, Tex., 
had undergone blood tests in Texas that found elevated levels of body toxins 
the liver should be removing, said hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon. Doctors 
performed Stormie's transplant at Children's Hospital in February, 1984, 
because she suffered from hyper-cholesterolemia, which causes fat to accumulate 
in the blood. She returned last October for bile duct reconstruction. McMahon 
said it was not yet clear if her new symptoms are related to the bile duct 
problem.

 -- Elena Ceausescu is more than the First Lady of Romania. Now the wife of 
President Nicolae Ceausescu is officially a national heroine, the Agerpres 
agency said. She was awarded the title "Heroine of the Socialist Republic of 
Romania" at a special luncheon marking her 70th birthday, attended by leading 
Communist Party officials. Elena Ceausescu, a prominent member of the Romanian 
Politburo, is regarded by many Western diplomats as second-in-command to her 
husband. Agerpres said party officials praised her activity in the country's 
underground movement during World War II. SHIRLEY MARLOW

O'CONNOR VOWS WAR ON VIOLENCE AND DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Declaring 1989 "The Year of the Child," Mayor Maureen O'Connor on Monday 
offered San Diego youngsters a slate of recreational, educational and social 
programs complemented by a pledge to dramatically strengthen the 
law-enforcement effort against street gangs and drug pushers. 
</P>
<P>
In her third State of the City address and the first of her new four-year term, 
O'Connor spent little time on the traditional functions of the City 
Charter-required annual address -- taking stock of past accomplishments or 
announcing her second-term goals. Instead, she expressed concern over the fate 
of the city's children and promised them "new status" in the city's priority 
list. 
</P>
<P>
"The city need not justify its alarm when our (children) can't find France on a 
map, can't cross the street without meeting a pusher, can't reach the age of 16 
without bearing a child, or 18 without witnessing a shooting," she said while 
standing at the front of the Reuben H. Fleet Space Theater in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It profits the city nothing to save our beaches and lose our children." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Czar for Children' 
</P>
<P>
In the fight against "the ever-lengthening shadows of drugs and violence," 
O'Connor proposed the creation of a "metro strike team" of 40 police officers 
to be assigned to the city's eastern and central divisions, and the 
establishment of a police substation at 30th Street and Imperial Avenue in 
Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
She also called for the creation of a new "czar for children" within city 
government to oversee coordination of child care, recreation and youth 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, she announced the establishment of a space, aviation, astronomy 
and science center as the highlight of a host of new recreational and 
educational programs to be started this year. 
</P>
<P>
The center, to be created by the Fleet Space Theater and Science Center, the 
International Aerospace Hall of Fame and the city, would be a "NASA-like space 
camp where children can learn firsthand the trajectory for space capsules, the 
orbit of the planets, and the intricacies of ground-control computers," 
O'Connor said. It would probably require a new facility somewhere in Balboa 
Park, her aides said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Multimedia Event 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor used the Fleet Theater's domed screen to make the 26th annual State of 
the City address a multimedia event. Illuminated by a single spotlight in a 
darkened house, she spoke against a projected backdrop of the city's nighttime 
skyline as images of clouds drifted slowly over her head. 
</P>
<P>
As she mentioned specific events of the year just past -- the visit of Mother 
Teresa, the Super Bowl, the negotiations for her upcoming Soviet arts festival 
-- images were flashed on the screen above and around her. 
</P>
<P>
Although she offered no timetables or cost figures for the programs, O'Connor 
said in an interview after her speech that she plans to ask the City Council to 
act on the police program during the current fiscal year, which would require 
dipping into the city's $450,000 contingency fund if new police officers are to 
be hired. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Lockwood, who attended the speech, said it would cost the 
city $1 million for every 18 new officers it adds to the 2,500-member police 
force. A new substation could cost $2 million, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
But, even if the council agreed to hire more officers before the new fiscal 
year begins July 1, the 22-week Police Academy training would delay their 
active duty at least until June, Lockwood said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shift Officers? 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood suggested, however, that some police officers could be shifted to 
high-crime and drug problem areas to begin O'Connor's program before the new 
budget year. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor is the third city official to call for a stronger police force in 
recent weeks. On Nov. 30, Lockwood unveiled a plan to add 440 officers to the 
police force at a cost of $62 million. Three weeks later, Councilman Bob Filner 
called for a $50-million tax increase to pay for having more police downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt, who represents the Southeast San Diego neighborhoods 
where gang warfare and drug sales are concentrated, praised O'Connor's 
two-pronged approach to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"It deals with the gang and the drug problem from a law-enforcement perspective 
and gives our young people some options," Pratt said after the speech. "Most 
young people want some options, because they know you can't continue to engage 
in that kind of activity." 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Schutze, a member of the San Diego Substance Abuse Commitment 
Committee, agreed. "If you're out dealing dope, you may be making $500 this 
week," she said. "But where are you next week? You're down in Juvenile Hall." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Diversion for Youth 
</P>
<P>
Among the diversions O'Connor proposed to offer the city's youth: 
</P>
<P>
* A combination children's workshop, museum and academy in Balboa Park's House 
of Charm. Modeled after the Children's Museum in La Jolla, the facility would 
give children a place to try out as newscasters, dancers, actors or computer 
programmers. 
</P>
<P>
* A "landmark children's play structure in a suitable park environment." 
</P>
<P>
* A series of city-sponsored programs for children, dubbed "Kids Club San 
Diego," which would offer children occasional free entry to the San Diego Zoo, 
Sea World, museums and sporting events, plus apprenticeship programs with 
business and government leaders. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor also promised to seek funds from a newly created federal program to 
carry out "innovative support projects for low-income children and their 
families" and called for the creation of "computerized telephonic" reporting 
for police officers in the field to lessen the time they spend on paper work. 
</P>
<P>
Although O'Connor touched only briefly on her 1988 accomplishments in the 
speech, she distributed a 25-page annual report listing what she considers the 
highlights of the past year. 
</P>
<P>
In the report, O'Connor takes varying amounts of credit for dozens of actions, 
including a 37% increase in federal funding to the city, the creation of a city 
Commission for Arts and Culture, increased representation of women and 
minorities on the city's boards and commissions, the planning of a new City 
Hall complex and the placement of the council's unsuccessful growth-management 
program on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
In her speech, O'Connor said she had kept 14 of the 16 promises she made in her 
1988 address and "helped five of my seven predictions" come true. She then 
offered six more predictions for this year, including victory in her highly 
publicized effort to thwart Southern California Edison's attempt to take over 
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor took another swipe at the merger proposal when she honored Red Scott, 
an SDG&amp;E director who voted against the takeover and then resigned, with 
one of her annual Seahorse Awards. As Scott took the stage, the theater's domed 
screen flashed the SCE logo -- circled in red with a red line slashing through 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also honored several individuals and groups with a "Seahorse Award," 
given each year to those who "best capture the real spirit of San Diego." The 
honorees: 
</P>
<P>
* Red Scott, who voted against the Southern California Edison takeover of San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric, then resigned from the SDG&amp;E board of directors 
to underscore his protest. 
</P>
<P>
* Willie Henderson and Richard Minor of Southcrest Little League, who spent 18 
years working to establish a hot dog stand at Southcrest Ballpark. The stand 
opened last month. The proceeds from the hot dog stand will be used to buy 
equipment for Little League teams. 
</P>
<P>
* Councilwoman Gloria McColl and the Olympic Site Task Force, who were 
instrumental in the selection of San Diego County as the site of a new, 
official U.S. Olympic training center. 
</P>
<P>
* Glenn Allison of Episcopal Community Services and the volunteers of the 
Interfaith Shelter Network, for providing food, clothing and shelter to the 
homeless. The network of more than 100 churches and synagogues has become a 
model for other cities. 
</P>
<P>
* Ted Kissane and the San Diego County Hotel-Motel Assn., for accepting an 
increase in hotel room taxes. An estimated $45 million in revenue from the 
increased taxes will be used to renovate Balboa Park, and $33 million is slated 
for underwriting the arts, including the Soviet arts festival in the fall.

OPPOSITION APPEARS STIFF TO NAMING CONVENTION CENTER FOR KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD BERNSTEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With letters and phone calls indicating overwhelming opposition to naming the 
San Diego convention center for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., City 
Council members meet today to decide one of the most politically and racially 
sensitive issues they have faced in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
As in 1986, when the council voted to rename Market Street in honor of the 
slain civil rights leader, the King tribute issue has touched a nerve in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks since a council committee approved adding King's name to the 
nearly completed bay-front convention center, the eight council members and 
Mayor Maureen O'Connor have received telephone calls and letters that reflect a 
range of feeling from outright racism to thoughtful opposition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Organized Group 
</P>
<P>
Although the volume of mail has not been especially heavy, because no group has 
organized to oppose the plan, the overwhelming majority of the communications 
are against the proposal, council aides said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Wes Pratt's file contains 14 letters of opposition and three in 
favor. Councilman Ron Roberts' file contains 20 letters of opposition and four 
in favor. Phone calls to those and other offices are following the same 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
"If the City Council votes to name the new convention center in honor of Martin 
Luther King Jr., the indignation of the voters will bring on a ballot 
initiative that will cause embarrassment to the city far beyond that created by 
the Market Street fiasco," one woman wrote to Pratt, who has led the effort to 
honor King. 
</P>
<P>
In a 1987 referendum, voters stripped the name "Martin Luther King Way" from 
Market Street and reinstituted the downtown thoroughfare's former name. 
</P>
<P>
Other opponents object to the perceived difficulty of marketing the convention 
center with King's name in it. 
</P>
<P>
"The city, the Port District and all the citizens of our community have too 
much at stake in this much-needed convention center to handcuff its development 
at this late stage," the general manager of an Old Town hotel wrote to Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Poised for Approval 
</P>
<P>
"When people lose their fear to drive through black neighborhoods is the time 
to eulogize their leaders," an El Cajon resident wrote. "I am a pragmatist and 
not a racist." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the council appears poised to approve the addition of King's name 
-- in some form -- to the $160-million center, which is scheduled to open this 
fall. Five members of the council's Rules Committee, enough to form a majority 
of the nine-member council, agreed Dec. 14 to forward two proposals to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
One suggested by Pratt would rename the facility "San Diego King Convention 
Center." That proposal is opposed by the citizens committee that recommended 
naming the center after King, because it does not contain his full name. A 
second suggestion, offered by Councilman Bruce Henderson, would add the full 
name to the building's title. 
</P>
<P>
A Pratt aide said Monday that Pratt will work to have King's full name 
included, but believes that his initial proposal has a better chance of 
approval by the Board of Port Commissioners. That panel, which named the 
facility the San Diego Convention Center in a 1985 contract with the city, must 
also agree to a name change. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor O'Connor and Council Members Pratt, Roberts, Henderson and Judy McCarty 
voted for the Rules Committee proposal. Councilwoman Gloria McColl, the 
committee's sixth member, was absent and has taken no position on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer has said she will vote for a name change, but has 
not decided which proposal she favors. Councilman Ed Struiksma is "leaning 
toward" San Diego King Convention Center, and Councilman Bob Filner has not 
decided, aides said Monday.

FIREMAN IN STABLE CONDITION AFTER HIGHWAY SHOOTING

<P>
A Los Angeles County firefighter shot in the face over the weekend while 
driving near Palomar Mountain was in stable condition Monday at Kaiser 
Permanente Hospital in San Diego as sheriff's deputies continued to look for 
suspects, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies investigating what they described as an attempted murder 
said Clayton Richard Howe, 31, was shot in the face while off duty at about 
1:50 p.m. Sunday in Valley Center, near where South Grade Road meets California 
76. 
</P>
<P>
Howe and a companion were on their way to Palomar Mountain when they were 
tailgated by an unknown number of people in a white Suzuki Samurai, sheriff's 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
"Howe was apparently traveling too slow for the Suzuki driver," said Sgt. Manny 
Castillo. 
</P>
<P>
Someone in the Suzuki displayed a shotgun and gestures were made back and forth 
between the occupants of both cars, Castillo said. The Suzuki eventually passed 
Howe and sped away. 
</P>
<P>
But when Howe reached the top of the grade, he saw the suspects pulled over on 
the shoulder of the road. Howe pulled in behind them, displayed his badge and 
ordered the suspects to drop their weapons, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
Then someone in the Suzuki fired a shotgun at Howe as he stood beside his own 
car. A passer-by stopped to help Howe as the suspects fled, sheriff's deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Howe was taken to Palomar Hospital in Escondido, where he was treated for 
facial and eye injuries. Sheriff's deputies said Sunday that Howe was expected 
to undergo further eye surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park Fire Chief James Page, a resident of Carlsbad, said: "The whole 
department is in a state of shock." Page said Howe has been a training officer 
at the Monterey Park station for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the most dedicated fire officers I've ever met," Page said. "At 
least two people here have talked to him today, and those reports sounded 
fairly optimistic," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Several suspects have been questioned and released. Homicide detectives are 
still investigating.

NURSING CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the editorial "Curing the Nurse Shortage" (Dec. 29), I disagree 
with the "experts who prepared the constructive report for the U.S. Department 
of Health Services." 
</P>
<P>
The commission's finding that the "money matters most" is wrong. The fact is 
that money cannot replace the decrease in a caring attitude toward patients. 
However, in addition to the change in attitude, it is important that nurses 
have "professional recognition, representation on policy-making, regulatory and 
accreditation boards, and the use of a more collaborative approach between 
nurses and other health professionals and the management." 
</P>
<P>
The hot-line effort to inform men and women about nursing career opportunities 
should include one very important question: Does the person, who is inquiring, 
really understand the meaning of the four-letter word care?

In his discussion of U.S. universities, Pfaff has made the error of confusing 
the movement for a more universalist foundation for a canon of knowledge with 
his unease at the relativist approach of "postmodern" literary theory. While 
the two may be related, they are not the same. 
</P>
<P>
My particular concern is with his assumption that Western civilization is 
somehow morally superior to other cultures. The very foundations of our 
heritage in the Greek classical period to which he attributes the birth of 
morality, were intertwined with slavery at home and subjugation abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this perversion of morality has persisted until recent times in the 
"white man's burden" and "manifest destiny" of colonialism and imperialist U.S. 
and European expansionism. This historical process included the devaluing of 
the cultural content and legacies of the civilizations that are now known as 
the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
A critical understanding of our own Western history and how its conduct has 
deviated from our ideology is essential to moral progress. It is also vital if 
we wish to integrate our own citizenry from other backgrounds into traditional 
U.S. intellectual life on a basis of self-respect and mutual appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
A more worldwide approach to the study of values and cultural development 
permits such awarenesses.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pfaff comments on the debate over "cultural relativism," the question of 
whether the thought and art of the West should be taught in our universities 
rather than that of, say, China or India. He relates this scholastic issue to a 
more profound problem of the 20th Century, something he calls "the problem of 
truth." "If truth doesn't exist or cannot be determined, why," he says, "do we 
do what we do?" And if "I possess the truth while you are in error, why should 
I not send you to prison, Siberia or the gas ovens in order to eliminate error 
from society?" He tries to answer this philosophical riddle by using reason, 
which he traces back to the rationalism of the ancient Greeks, whom he credits 
with giving us "our essential quality as a society." 
</P>
<P>
Although I am in sympathy with his conclusion that our universities have a 
right, indeed an obligation, to teach the classics as they have for years, I 
could not disagree more with his history. Greek rationalism has little to do 
with the quality of Western society, which can, in fact, be traced back to the 
ancient Hebrews, and more precisely the Ten Commandments. It is ironic that 
Pfaff makes this mistake, since it undermines his case. 
</P>
<P>
That's because rationalism is relative. It changes with place and time. 
</P>
<P>
Western civilization is based on an absolute knowledge of good and evil, right 
and wrong. In our society, for instance, it is absolutely right to do unto 
others as you would have them do unto you. It is right to believe that life is 
sacred, and absolutely wrong to think otherwise. Murder is wrong. These are not 
debatable issues. They are the bedrock of Western thinking and are, in fact, 
carved in stone, the two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
Lest there be any doubt of its importance to Western civilization, imagine how 
different things would be if the Decalogue read differently, if, for instance, 
the commandment to honor one's mother and father failed to mention "mother." 
Some scholars trace the beginning of the women's movement back to that 
commandment, along with the commandments against adultery and coveting thy 
neighbor's wife. 
</P>
<P>
In short, though Pfaff might have a "truth problem," Western civilization does 
not. Perhaps that is why he concludes on a fearful note, lamenting what this 
current academic debate might yield, but I, for one, am not worried. We've 
plenty of room on our library shelves. Let the students question, probe and 
challenge. That, after all, is the soul of true learning, and I feel our 
schools are enlivened by it.

It is heartwarming to know that Rideau has prospered in prison instead of 
succumbing to the usual pitfalls of incarceration. Nonetheless, Rideau is right 
where he belongs. It matters not that he has learned how to write his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
Rideau's crime was a cold, calculated execution. He has been rehabilitated. Now 
he is accepting his punishment as prescribed by law.

Why should Arafat have better access to that information, unless he is part of

WHY NO OUTRAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who would have guessed eight years ago that Ronald Reagan would submit his 
final federal budget on Monday with the "good news" that the proposed budget 
deficit for the coming year would be only $92.5 billion? Or that the new 
deficit figure would be the smallest of all the eight deficits generated by the 
Reagan Administration? Or that the federal debt would grow by nearly $1.5 
trillion during the Reagan years, more than all the previous debt compiled by 
Reagan's 39 predecessors? 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Reagan budget was greeted on Capitol Hill with yawns. Nothing new, 
said some members of Congress. Irrelevant, said others, looking forward to 
President-elect George Bush's own proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Yawns for a budget deficit of nearly $100 billion in the absence of war or 
recession? Where is the outrage? It is outrageous that a $92.5-billion deficit 
can be considered business as usual. But even the $92.5-billion figure is a 
sham. The budget is based on overly optimistic economic forecasts and on the 
assumption that Congress will go along with spending cuts and federal asset 
sales that it has rejected repeatedly in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the real deficit for the coming budget year is closer to $140 billion 
because of a bookkeeping gimmick: The budget counts about $50 billion in 
temporary surplus Social Security trust-fund revenues against the deficit. 
These are tax receipts collected now to be set aside to meet the growing demand 
for Social Security benefits in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
That still is not the full story. The debt does not go away each year. It piles 
up, and the federal government must pay interest on it. Annual debt interest 
has risen during the Reagan years from $69 billion to $170 billion. Counting 
this increased debt financing, the real cost of the deficit legacy of the 1980s 
is close to $250 billion for the new budget year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Reagan is not alone in this deficit deception. Congress has been a 
co-conspirator by going along with the Social Security gimmick and refusing to 
be first in proposing the tax increase needed to make a significant dent in the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In his budget message on Monday, Reagan took credit for fostering the greatest 
peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history. Of course, it is an expansion 
built in large part on the quicksand of federal deficits. He said that the 
nation could wean itself from deficit financing without new taxes if only 
Congress would give him the necessary budget reforms. But no reforms are needed 
to produce a balanced budget. All it takes is plain old- fashioned budgeting in 
which spending is made to equal revenue, or vice versa. The nation establishes 
spending priorities and then pays for them. 
</P>
<P>
First, however, Washington needs to hear a little outrage.

CAN'T ANYONE IN L.A. HOLD CHIEF GATES ACCOUNTABLE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO H. RODRIGUEZ, Antonio H. Rodriguez, an attorney, is the executive 
director of the Latino Community Justice Center, which is conducting a project 
to monitor abuses by police and immigration agencies in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is, unfortunately, precedent for the Los Angeles City Council's decision 
to use the taxpayers' money to pay for a jury judgment of punitive damages 
against Police Chief Daryl F. Gates. The city's Mexican community still has 
painful memories of a similar council action in 1970. The reprise should raise 
concerns about our city government's attitude toward police officers' 
accountability for their actions and, ultimately, about the power of the police 
Establishment in Los Angeles politics. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970 case, heavily armed Los Angeles Police Department officers 
searching for a murder suspect stormed the wrong Skid Row hotel room. They shot 
all its occupants -- unarmed, innocent Mexican immigrants. Two of the men ("the 
Sanchez cousins," as they have become known) were killed and three wounded. 
Later the police said that the man being sought was no longer a suspect in the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
An outraged Latino community demanded that the officers be held accountable for 
their actions, calling for their prosecution and removal from the force. The 
district attorney's office filed criminal charges against the officers, and the 
FBI announced that it also would prosecute them under federal civil-rights 
statutes. But, under intense pressure from the police Establishment, the City 
Council voted to pay for the officers' defense. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually the criminal charges against the officers were dismissed and they 
were acquitted of the federal charges. The department took no disciplinary 
measures against them. 
</P>
<P>
The current case involving Gates stems from a federal jury's finding that 
several LAPD officers had, by using excessive force in a search, violated the 
civil rights of a low-income Latino family named Larez. The jury also found 
that Gates had condoned the officers' unlawful behavior, and it ordered him to 
pay $170,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The key to that finding lay in contemptuous and arguably racist remarks that 
Gates had made outside the courtroom. As widely reported in the media, Gates 
suggested that the Larezes were lucky that their beatings had not been worse, 
that their injuries were not worth the amount awarded, and that they had been 
"cleaned up" for their court appearances. 
</P>
<P>
What followed was a fascinating demonstration of the police Establishment's 
power with the city's political Establishment. Shortly after the jury verdict 
was announced, Gates met in secret with City Council members and pressured them 
into an immediate, unanimous and uncritical resolution to pay for the judgment 
against him. By then Mayor Tom Bradley (himself a former LAPD officer) had 
announced his support for Gates. 
</P>
<P>
There was no need for the City Council to make its decision at this time. The 
city is not required to pay for punitive damages imposed on its employees for 
actions that they took in the course of city business. The city attorney's 
office had already announced plans to appeal the verdict against Gates. The 
council could have simply waited for the years of appeals to run their course 
and then make the decision, if it was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the council felt compelled to send the community an immediate 
political message of support for Gates. And, apparently, the council did so 
without considering -- or, worse, with callous disregard for -- how that 
message would be heard in the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
The most disturbing fact is that all this transpired without anyone in city 
government daring to criticize Gates for his intemperate remarks. The message 
is clear, and ominous: When the chips are down, holding police officers 
accountable for unlawful actions is not a political priority. 
</P>
<P>
The council's attitude in this matter adds mistrust of elected officials to the 
damage that Gates has done to relations between the police and the community. 
</P>
<P>
With many of our people locked in the inner city, the Latino community places 
great value on good police protection. However, we also want protection from 
officers who would misuse their authority. We therefore place equal value on 
effective disciplinary policies and practices that ensure accountability of 
police officers for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, such policies must have the full, public support of the police 
chief and his division commanders if they are to prevent intentional and 
reckless conduct that violates peoples' human and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
Some things have changed since 1970. We even have Latinos on the City Council. 
But apparently the police Establishment is still the most powerful political 
force in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the latest damage to community trust might still be repaired. For 
starters, if it is not too much to ask, Gates should apologize for his 
statements. If he does not, the mayor and the City Council should press him to 
do so. And the council should reconsider, in public debate, its decision to pay 
for the judgment. Then they all should re-examine and adjust the inadequate 
policies, practices and attitudes toward police-officer accountability. Concern 
for protecting the public's human and civil rights should override the powerful 
political hand of the police.

DOCTOR GETS PROBATION IN POSING FOR EXPLICIT PHOTOS WITH GIRL, 6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Oregon vascular surgeon was placed on three years probation, ordered to 
perform 500 hours of community service and fined $5,000 Monday for taking 
sexually explicit photographs of himself with the sleeping 6-year-old daughter 
of friends he was visiting in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Alan B. Haber also ordered Daniel J. Lindner, 33, 
not to treat patients under the age of 16 and not to be alone with anyone under 
18 without a responsible adult present during the probation period. 
</P>
<P>
Lindner, of Portland, Ore., pleaded guilty last November to committing lewd and 
lascivious acts with a child under the age of 14, a felony, during the October, 
1986, visit. He entered the plea under an agreement with prosecutors that he 
would receive no more than a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The child's mother told Haber on Monday that she did not want Lindner to be 
incarcerated. She said she thought that Lindner had suffered enough from 
humiliation and from the suspension of his medical license by Oregon 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In sentencing Lindner, Haber said he considered the mother's wishes and took 
into account the fact that there was no evidence that Lindner had touched the 
child or harmed her. The judge also imposed a suspended 30-day jail sentence, 
which Lindner can be ordered to serve if he does not prepare a plan for doing 
the community service by a Feb. 24 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
According to a probation officer's report, Lindner was visiting the family 
while attending a medical conference in the Los Angeles area. Lindner told the 
probation officer he drank one and a half bottles of wine on the night of the 
incident, in which authorities said he photographed himself in sexually 
explicit poses with the sleeping child. 
</P>
<P>
Lindner was prosecuted after he took the film to a photo development service 
that notified Portland police, authorities said. Lindner surrendered to Los 
Angeles police in January, 1987, according to court records.

FIRE DAMAGES SHERMAN OAKS SQUARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A fire that swept through a two-story Sherman Oaks shopping center early Monday 
caused an estimated $1 million dollars in damage, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at 2:35 a.m. in Sherman Oaks Square shopping center in the 
4400 block of Van Nuys Boulevard, department spokesman Jim Williamson said. No 
businesses were open and there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the blaze was under investigation late Monday, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center contains two buildings with 30 shops and offices. 
Williamson said the fire was contained in one of the buildings but heavily 
damaged several small businesses, including Sundeck Tanning Center, Angelo's 
Hair Design, Fanfare, Insurance by Design, Discovery Shop and Mailboxes of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
About 115 firefighters were called to the scene and extinguished the blaze in 
about an hour. Structural damage was estimated at $750,000 and content loss at 
$249,000. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses in the shopping center's second building were open Monday.

SITTER SENTENCED TO PRISON IN DEATH OF INFANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During an emotional hearing, baby sitter Vickie Maas was sentenced Monday to 
eight years and eight months in prison for involuntary manslaughter in the 
death of a 6-month-old baby and the abuse of two other infants. 
</P>
<P>
Maas, 28, who had been calm and expressionless through most of the five-week 
trial, buried her face in her hands and cried as San Fernando Superior Court 
Judge Howard J. Schwab announced the sentence, the maximum for that crime. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years as a judge this is the most aggravated case of amorality that 
I have ever seen," Schwab said. "This case will haunt me for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
A San Fernando Superior Court jury found Maas guilty Dec. 16 of killing David 
Allen Duncan, aged 6 months. David died Jan. 8, 1988, of brain injuries two 
days after Maas had shaken him violently because he was crying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Counts of Abuse 
</P>
<P>
Maas was also found guilty of three counts of felony child abuse. One count was 
related to David's death and the others to injuries received by 6-month-old 
Travis Hoyt, whose ear was bruised in August, 1987, and 7-month-old Nicholas 
McNerny, who suffered a broken leg in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The families of the three infants attended the sentencing. They wore buttons 
with David Duncan's picture. Some broke into applause and embraced, while 
others wept tears of joy after Schwab handed down the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my birthday and this was the best present ever," said Karen Duncan, 
David's mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the judge really did the right thing by us and by society" said 
Larry Duncan, David's father. "We can't bring David back, but it does relieve 
some of the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Maas' in-laws said the sentence was unnecessarily harsh. "I don't think the 
maximum was correct at all," said Ronald Maas, Vickie Maas' father-in-law. "Two 
wrongs don't make a right. 
</P>
<P>
During sentencing, Larry H. Layton, Maas' attorney, called psychiatrist Hugh 
Wilson Ridlehuber to testify about a neuropsychiatric impairment from which he 
said Maas suffered. 
</P>
<P>
Ridlehuber, who began treating Maas in March, concluded that she had a rare 
neuropsychiatric ailment known as "intermittent explosive disorder." He said 
the condition, caused by brain damage, led to periodic bouts of violent 
behavior, similar to seizures. 
</P>
<P>
"With stress, with particular types of stress, she can explode and react 
violently," Ridlehuber said. He said loud noises often triggered the reactions, 
noises such as a telephone ringing repeatedly and the sound of babies crying. 
</P>
<P>
He said that after the explosive episodes, Maas could not remember details of 
the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Ridlehuber also said that Maas had used marijuana and cocaine in an effort to 
"self-medicate" her psychiatric condition. 
</P>
<P>
"Her use of these drugs was an attempt to treat herself," Ridlehuber said. A 
titter ran through the crowd of about 45 in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Schwab expressed doubts about the psychiatrist's assessment, saying specific 
details in Maas' testimony about the shaking of David and the injuries of the 
two other infants indicated she was lying. 
</P>
<P>
"Her statements were inconsistent with physical evidence," Schwab said. Maas 
testified that she shook David "gently."

LA FOLLETTE FAILS TO OUST WRIGHT FROM PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Assemblywoman Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge) said Monday after a meeting 
of Republican lawmakers that she was unable to muster the votes necessary to 
replace Assemblywoman Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) on the powerful Assembly 
Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
La Follette described the situation as a standoff, with another meeting of the 
Assembly Republican Caucus planned later this week or next to discuss the 
issue. In the meantime, several GOP members are expected to continue to 
pressure Wright to resign her committee seat, La Follette said. So far, Wright 
has refused. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-member GOP caucus last week narrowly voted to rescind Wright's 
appointment to the committee because she had failed to follow the caucus 
position to support a dissident Democrat, who last month challenged Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Stan Statham (R-Oak Run) said only about 20 of the GOP lawmakers 
showed up for Monday's meeting. Statham said that if he were in Wright's shoes, 
"I wouldn't let people push me around." 
</P>
<P>
Wright did not attend the latest party caucus. Wright said she saw "no reason 
for me to be there. I don't need any more Cathie bashing." She added that she 
hopes her critics drop their challenge.

Jane McGlory is the founder of the Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center. A 
family tragedy inspired her to work to improve the odds for young people 
growing up in her community. McGlory, 55, and her husband, Albert, live in 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
I had four sons. My very oldest son went into the service at the age of 18. 
When he went in, he wasn't smoking regular cigarettes. When he came home three 
years later at the age of 21, he was addicted to heroin. 
</P>
<P>
I was so excited he was home. I was going to have all my sons home for 
Thanksgiving. I was busy cooking Thanksgiving night. He had gone back to his 
old job at UCLA. When he didn't come home I thought, "Well, maybe he'll call 
later." It got to be 1 o'clock, Thanksgiving Day, so I told the children, "We 
haven't heard from Bill, but we'll just go on and eat." Then the phone rang, 
and it was his supervisor calling me, telling me that Bill had just been found 
dead on the job. When the autopsy came back, he had died from an overdose of 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
The hurt I felt from that, I can't explain it to you. But it's a deep hurt from 
within. That was one of the hardest things I had had to do in life. You just 
pray and hope no other parent has to ever go through this. So I dedicated the 
rest of my life to help fight drugs in our young people. I worked with young 
people, one-on-one, telling them to stay away from drugs and get their 
education, and if you know anybody dealing with drugs, stay away from them. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later I was at another funeral, of a young man Bill's age, who just 
got into drugs here at home. Then every six months I was back down at the 
mortuary viewing another young person that had expired from overdosing from 
drugs. It was getting to me. I had to do something that would involve more 
people than the few that I was in contact with. It was such a heavy burden on 
my heart. 
</P>
<P>
I know an idle mind is the devil's workshop. These young people don't have 
enough to do. There's no recreation in this northeast part of the San Fernando 
Valley for our young people. There's not a theater, there's not a skating rink, 
there's not a bowling alley. A lot of young people have gotten on drugs, just 
through curiosity, wondering what it's like. 
</P>
<P>
I was asleep one night, and I had a beautiful dream. I saw this beautiful 
choir, just full of lovely young people, singing. When I woke up, it was so 
real. I said, "That's it; young people like music." So I got busy and started 
the Community Gospel Choir. 
</P>
<P>
I told a young man named Paul Myers what was on my heart and what I wanted to 
do. He made signs with the date we were going to start having this Gospel choir 
and put them up in all the different stores and recreation centers. There were 
16 young people there, and we grew to about 85 young people, and it was 
beautiful. We started June 20, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
They have sung all over the state of California, and in fact, in 1980, they 
chartered a bus and they went all through the South. It was really an 
experience for the young people. 
</P>
<P>
We started out with just a choir, and after the choir got started, the first 
month, we started the drama group. Young people like to do plays. It was 
something new for the community. We started getting bigger and bigger, so we 
incorporated as the Pacoima Community Youth Cultural Center. We wanted to help 
the youth have a better life, a longer life and a meaningful life. 
</P>
<P>
We do our very best to help our young people in any way that we can help. We 
could do a lot more if we had more funds, but even when we don't have funds, 
we're out there helping. When we do receive funds, we stretch them and do as 
much as we can. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is, if you're living in this world and not reaching out to help 
somebody, it's a wasted life -- that's my personal feeling. We don't pass this 
way but one time, and as I pass through I don't want my living to be in vain. I 
want to be able to help somebody as I pass this way.

<P>
City Councilman Ernani Bernardi left the hospital Monday, five days after he 
hit his head in a fall at his Van Nuys home while suffering from a flu-like 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
The 77-year-old northeast San Fernando Valley councilman required five stitches 
after cutting his head last Wednesday when he stood to answer the phone and, 
weakened by his illness, fainted and fell. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City said 
Bernardi was "stable and doing fine" when he checked out. 
</P>
<P>
The councilman's aides said they did not know when he would return to work. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardi, the council's senior member with nearly 28 years of service, faces an 
election in April.

SDSU CLAIMS NEBRASKA TAMPERED WITH TRANSFER; 
</P>
<P>
WAGNER IMPROPERLY INFLUENCED, SAYS MILLER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State intends to pursue its claim that the University of Nebraska has 
tampered in the transfer of former Aztec tailback Darrin Wagner, SDSU Athletic 
Director Fred Miller said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he is concerned that "a representative of Nebraska's athletic 
interests" had contact with Wagner while he was on the SDSU team and improperly 
influenced Wagner's decision to transfer to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, in a telephone interview from San Francisco where he is attending the 
National Collegiate Athletic Assn. convention, declined to identify who he 
suspects might have tampered with Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska Athletic Director Bob Devaney, also reached at the convention, said he 
is not familiar with Wagner's situation but defended Nebraska's policies. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't tamper," Devaney said. "We've never tampered in our football 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, the 1987 Times' All-San Diego County back from Lincoln High School, 
said Saturday he was transferring to Nebraska after a freshman season in which 
he did not play in a game for SDSU. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said Miller's action will not change his plans to leave Thursday for 
Lincoln, Neb., and enroll for the spring semester beginning Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what they say or do, I'm going to Nebraska," Wagner said. 
"They're mad because they're losing me, and they will do anything to keep me 
from going. If they can't have me, they don't want anyone else to have me." 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he wrote to Devaney last week to protest the alleged tampering and 
to say that he would pursue the matter if Wagner enrolled at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said his next step will be to write to the commissioners of the Western 
Athletic Conference, of which SDSU is a member, and the Big Eight Conference, 
of which Nebraska is a member, charging Nebraska with tampering. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said he was concerned that Nebraska violated provisions of the national 
letter of intent program. Under the program, schools are not allowed to 
initiate contact with an athlete concerning a transfer once the athlete has 
agreed to or enrolled at a school. The initial contact must come from the 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner and his father, Norman, said they initiated the contact with Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no tampering," Wagner said. "My parents didn't even know I wanted to 
go to Nebraska until I told them." 
</P>
<P>
The Wagners said the only outside advice they sought was from Ray Hooper, 
former Lincoln coach whom Norman Wagner said was a family friend. Hooper 
coached Wagner when he was a sophomore at Lincoln. Hooper accompanied the 
Wagners to a meeting with Miller and other SDSU officials in November. 
</P>
<P>
Hooper also coached Nebraska quarterback Steve Taylor at Lincoln and served as 
Taylor's legal guardian when Taylor was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Hooper could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner, a 6-foot, 190-pounder, has been the center of controversy since he left 
the team Nov. 4.

SAUDI ARABIA HIKES ESTIMATED RESERVES OF OIL, GAS SHARPLY; 
</P>
<P>
NEW ASSESSMENT INDICATES NATION HAS 50% MORE CRUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, already blessed with the world's largest reserves of crude oil, 
declared Monday that a new computer assessment shows it has about 50% more 
crude oil and 25% more natural gas than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
If correct, the new Saudi numbers would boost by about 10% the free world's 
proven reserves of crude oil to the 900-billion-barrel range. This would tend 
to prolong the oil era and underscore the reliance of industrialized nations on 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Some Saudi watchers said the dramatic upward revision is legitimate and 
overdue, while others said it was at least partly inspired by the politics of 
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Both views might be correct, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a political announcement. On the other hand, they may well have the 
oil," said William D. Dietzman, a retired Energy Department geologist who has 
studied the Saudi oil fields for the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
Several other OPEC nations, including Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela, have 
also increased their own oil reserve estimates sharply in the past year. The 
higher a country's reserves, the greater its influence and production quota in 
OPEC. Within the oil community, Iran's claims are widely discounted while the 
others are accepted to varying degrees. 
</P>
<P>
The Saudis, through their Arabian American Oil Co., or Aramco, said that six 
years of studies at their new oil exploration and engineering computer center 
showed that they have 252.4 billion barrels of proven crude oil underground and 
177.3 trillion cubic feet of gas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
U.S. Estimates Similar 
</P>
<P>
For many years, the official Saudi government number was 110 billion barrels. 
But since at least 1975, the scientific community has carried Saudi Arabia on 
its books as having 150 billion to 170 billion barrels, the estimate varying 
annually with oil prices, discoveries and production levels. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., said its estimate a year ago was 167 
billion barrels, similar to the Saudis' own numbers at that time. The USGS put 
the natural gas estimate at 130 trillion cubic feet, while Aramco had 
previously estimated 141 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
Dietzman and others said the timing of the announcement dramatically boosting 
the Saudis' official oil reserve estimate strongly suggests that it was 
inspired by the need to hold their ground within OPEC for the purposes of 
determining quotas. 
</P>
<P>
"They're saying, if Iraq says it has 100 billion barrels, then we say we have 
250 billion," Dietzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the political element, any assessment of how much oil is 
underground and how much of it can be recovered with known technology and 
current prices is inexact. But in Saudi Arabia, the reserves are considered so 
large that it is hard to challenge any estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Consultant Joseph Story of McLean, Va., a former Aramco executive, said there 
is so much oil in Saudi Arabia that until recently, not much effort has been 
expended at determining just how much there is. 
</P>
<P>
But skyrocketing oil prices in the late 1970s and early 1980s prompted Saudi 
Arabia to spend some of the financial windfall on establishing a 
state-of-the-art oil exploration and engineering center in Dhahran in 1982 that 
is the envy of oil geologists. 
</P>
<P>
Aramco, calling the latest estimates "very conservative," said the work done at 
the Dhahran center is the basis for the big increase in the official reserve 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no need to look for oil. But now they've put a lot of money into 
upgrading their seismic capabilities and into exploration activity," said 
Story, president of Gulf Consulting Services Inc. "The point of this is, the 
numbers are probably true. But in announcing it, they might also be trying to 
alleviate any worries that there are going to be shortages any time soon." 
</P>
<P>
The more plentiful the supplies of low-cost crude oil such as Saudi Arabia's, 
the lower prices are likely to remain. However, the Middle East oil fields -- 
which already account for about 70% of free world oil reserves -- are expected 
to account for a steadily increasing share as other producing countries such as 
the United States run low. 
</P>
<P>
Aramco, once a joint venture of the Saudi government and the U.S. oil giants 
Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and Texaco, operates Saudi Arabia's oil fields. It is now 
100% owned by the Saudis and its duties are to be supplanted by a new national 
oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co.

JACK KENT COOKE CABLE SALE MAY TOP $1.5 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a deal expected to top $1.5 billion, entrepreneur Jack Kent Cooke announced 
Monday that he has tentatively agreed to sell his nationwide cable television 
properties to a consortium of cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke, whose holdings include the Washington Redskins football team and the 
Daily News in Van Nuys, did not disclose the sale price for his Cooke 
CableVision Inc., which has about 700,000 subscribers in 19 states. One of the 
buyers said the group agreed not to divulge such information. 
</P>
<P>
However, the prices in some other major cable system sales last year exceeded 
$2,400 per subscriber. Also, according to published reports when the Cooke 
properties were put up for sale last August, he was seeking more than $1.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Cooke sale agreement comes at a time of rising cable fees, those charged by 
the basic cable firms that provide the programming, as well as by the multiple 
system operators. 
</P>
<P>
If it is completed, the Cooke sale would be the largest since last year's 
$1.55-billion purchase by Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp. of the 
Storer cable properties from the leveraged buyout firm of Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator, also is a major 
member of the consortium that has agreed to buy the Cooke properties. Although 
no one at Denver-based TCI was available for comment, a source said that firm 
would obtain about 200,000 subscribers in the West and Midwest. As of last June 
30, TCI had 4.3 million subscribers, according to Channels magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Another major buyer in the Cooke deal -- and one with a key role in organizing 
the consortium -- is InterMedia Partners, a San Francisco limited partnership 
formed recently to acquire and operate cable TV systems and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
InterMedia said the Cooke properties that it intends to buy serve about 215,000 
subscribers in the Sun Belt. They include systems in Tucson and neighboring 
counties in Arizona; certain suburbs of Nashville and Knoxville, Tenn., and of 
Atlanta, and the city and environs of Aiken, S.C. Communications executive 
Frank Washington of Sacramento will be associated with InterMedia in operating 
the cable properties as the general partner of Robin Cable Systems. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon Cable TV of Los Angeles said it and its affiliates will acquire Cooke 
properties serving about 44,000 subscribers in Oregon. Of these, Falcon Cable 
Systems Co., an affiliate, is to acquire about 13,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to a person familiar with the deal, other buyers include TCA Cable TV 
Inc., which will acquire about 87,000 subscribers in the South and Southwest; 
Hawk Cable, getting about 84,000 East Coast and Southern subscribers; Chambers 
Communications, acquiring 30,000 in the West, and Rock Associates, getting 
23,000 in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
James Lacher, executive vice president of Jack Kent Cooke Inc., the 
entrepreneur's principal holding company, said from his Woodland Hills offices 
that he could not elaborate on the company's brief prepared statement 
announcing the deal. 
</P>
<P>
InterMedia, whose investors include banks, insurance firms and pension funds, 
said its managing general partner, Leo J. Hindery Jr., organized the consortium 
with Denver-based consultant Brian Deevy of Daniels &amp; Associates. The other 
members designated Hindery and Deevy to negotiate with Cooke and his 
associates. The Cooke deal is InterMedia's first major transaction. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals and the execution of a 
definitive sales agreement, is expected to be concluded at midyear, InterMedia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Cooke, 76, who has his headquarters in Middleburg, Va., is one of the country's 
wealthiest people. He formerly owned the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, 
the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and the place where they play, the Inglewood 
Forum. His present holdings include the Chrysler Building in New York and other 
newspapers in New Mexico and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
He founded his fortune through newspaper publishing and broadcasting ventures 
in Canada, in partnership with Canadian press lord Roy Thomson until 1952. 
Cooke then moved to the United States and became a citizen in 1960.

HARRY BERNSTEIN / LABOR: CHILD CARE A BIG NEED THAT U.S. CAN'T MEET ON THE 
CHEAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look at almost any statistic showing the dramatically changing role of women in 
the workplace and you'll understand why members of the 100th Congress proposed 
nearly 150 bills dealing with just one effect of that change: the need for 
child care. 
</P>
<P>
But the idea-laden Congress has done precious little about that or any other 
family-oriented issue. Such issues were generally called "labor issues;" 
somehow using the word "labor" made the problems politically easier for the 
relatively affluent congressmen to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
Now most Republicans and Democrats claim they realize that this country must 
face up to the increased political potency of the emotionally charged family 
problems created by the United States' enormous demographic shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Here's one fact that helped raise the consciousness level of both politicians 
and the corporate executives clever enough to think about the implications that 
the data has for their own work forces: In 1950, only 12% of women with 
children younger than 6 had jobs outside their homes, compared to 60% today. 
</P>
<P>
Another provocative fact: More than half of all children under 6 have mothers 
who work outside their homes. 
</P>
<P>
President-elect George Bush has declared that the problem of providing help for 
working parents with young children "is the single most important issue arising 
from changes in our work force." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), a crusader for meaningful child-care 
legislation, rightly bemoans the fact that the United States is one of only two 
industrialized nations without such a law. The other is South Africa, hardly a 
country sensitive to labor -- or to the family problems of most of its 
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
Congress almost passed an inadequate bill last year, but it died as the members 
squabbled over widely differing proposals. 
</P>
<P>
A growing number of corporations say they are really thinking hard about 
offering child care as a basic fringe benefit. Some employers even call it the 
fringe benefit of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
But with all that heavy corporate thinking, only about 3,300 of the country's 6 
million companies have actually done much about it. 
</P>
<P>
Unions are making a concentrated attempt to win contracts to help single-parent 
families or those with two working parents, but with very limited success. 
</P>
<P>
Not much has actually been done in Congress yet, in part because the members 
could not agree on the government's role in helping parents keep both jobs and 
children. Surprisingly, however, there are no serious differences over money 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Congress tried with little success to do something about 
child care in a substantive way. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats realized then that it would take a considerable amount of money to do 
any good at all. They proposed a child-care bill that would have provided $7 
billion by 1975 -- enough to get a running start toward easing the growing 
problem faced by working parents. 
</P>
<P>
That sum, adjusted for inflation, would have amounted to about $15.5 billion in 
1988 dollars, according to Nancy Saltford of the Employee Benefit Research 
Institute, whose valuable study of the issue was released last month. 
</P>
<P>
The latest proposal of those "free-spend ing" Democrats, however, would have 
cost only $2.5 billion for child care, compared to the inflation-adjusted $15.5 
billion they were ready to spend in the early 1970s. They have regressed 
considerably. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Republicans? 
</P>
<P>
President Richard M. Nixon vetoed the Democratic measure in 197l, backing 
instead a Republican plan priced at a measly $250 million. That difference over 
money killed the bill altogether, and there wasn't much steam behind child-care 
proposals until the 100th Congress convened two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Republicans say the $2.5 billion proposed by the Democrats is about 
what they themselves are willing to spend. In other words, the GOP moved 
forward on the money question while the Democrats moved backward. 
</P>
<P>
But they are far apart on the way they want to spend the money. Even worse, 
none of the plans are nearly adequate to meet the need. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has a plan that would cost about $2.2 billion -- about half as much spent 
annually on the stealth bomber, a project of, at best, uncertain value. 
</P>
<P>
He has proposed a tax credit of up to $1,000 for each child under 4, but he 
wants it offered whether or not both parents work outside the home, and that 
makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
However, does Bush think that once children reach age 4 they are pretty much 
ready to go it alone, or that four years after the baby comes, the parents will 
be rich enough to do without the $1,000 child-care tax subsidy? 
</P>
<P>
An improved Bush plan should be combined with proposals most Democrats want: 
government help to expand child-care services and fix minimum standards for 
providers of the care. They also want to provide small subsidies for low-income 
families in which both parents work at outside jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a business research organization, figures that child-care 
services range from $1,500 to $10,000 a year, and most parents pay $3,000, or 
about what it takes to go to some public colleges. 
</P>
<P>
We cannot provide adequate child care on the cheap. But if we really believe in 
the value of family life -- and that both women and men are wanted and needed 
as workers outside the home -- it will be well worth the investment.

California's economy will again grow faster than the rest of the country in 
1989, aggravating the state's transportation and housing problems, Bank of 
America said in its annual state economic forecast. California's real gross 
state product will grow 3.5% in 1989, said Frederick Cannon, vice president and 
senior economist at the bank. Although that is slower than the 4.8% growth 
expected in 1988 and the 6.2% growth in 1987, it will be 0.7% faster than the 
U.S. real gross national product, Cannon said.

Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has agreed to plead guilty to six felonies 
to avoid an indictment for financial fraud, said a deadline set for today for 
reaching agreement with the SEC had been dropped. "These discussions are still 
under way," a Drexel spokesman said, adding that a settlement is still 
expected. As part of the plea-bargaining agreement with the U.S. Attorney's

The chairman of the National Mediation Board halted talks between troubled 
Eastern Airlines and its largest union and returned to Washington. Chairman 
Walter Wallace could not be reached for comment, but an Eastern executive said 
Wallace gave as his reason the failure of efforts to keep the talks with the 
machinists union secret. Wallace arrived Friday for the talks at a hotel in Key 
Largo, Fla. The sessions were aimed at ending a contract stalemate that has 
clouded the future of the airline, which is a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp. of 
Houston.

FOREIGN PLANTS ON RISE IN MEXICO; 
</P>
<P>
NUMBER OF MAQUILADORAS INCREASED RECORD 45% IN '88 
</P>

Boosted by the low cost of labor and heightened competitive pressures in the 
United States, the number of foreign-owned manufacturing plants called 
maquiladoras operating in the Tijuana region grew by 45% in 1988, the largest 
single-year increase ever, a Mexican official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid expansion of maquiladoras, now Mexico's second-leading generator of 
foreign currency after oil, is an indication of the plants' importance to the 
Mexican economy as a generator of jobs and foreign exchange. The rapid rate of 
increase, which shows little sign of abating, came despite growing concerns 
about the area's overburdened power, water and transportation systems. 
</P>
<P>
Maquiladoras are foreign-operated plants where goods destined mainly for the 
U.S. market are manufactured or assembled with low cost Mexican labor. 
Favorable U.S. import laws instituted in 1965 mean U.S. manufacturers using the 
plants pay duty only on the value added to their products in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
52,957 Workers 
</P>
<P>
Total maquiladoras operating in Tijuana, Tecate and Ensenada totaled 579 as of 
Dec. 31, up 45% from the 400 in operation a year ago, said Jose Luis Ascolani, 
the Baja California delegate of the federal Secretary of Commerce and 
Industrial Development, the agency responsible for approving maquiladora 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
Total employees numbered 52,957, up 44% from the 36,672 employed at 
maquiladoras a year ago. Another 15,000 workers are thought to be employed at 
"shelter" plants that foreign firms use on a contract basis for assembly or 
manufacturing tasks. 
</P>
<P>
In the Tijuana region alone, maquiladoras are now bringing in $23 million 
monthly to the regional economy, nearly twice the dollar amount two years ago, 
Ascolani said. 
</P>
<P>
The year saw the arrival of several more giant Japanese consumer electronics 
manufacturers in Tijuana, including Pioneer Speakers, Casio Computer, Canon, 
Kyocera and Scripto Tokai. The Japanese firms see maquiladoras as an essential 
means of competing in the U.S. market, said James Reid, a executive vice 
president of Iget Corp., a U.S. subsidiary of Mitsui &amp; Co. that assists 
Japanese firms considering plants in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
American manufacturers, who operate more than 90% of the maquiladoras, also 
increased their presence. Among the notable newcomer was box manufacturer 
Container Corp. of America. Tony Ramirez, a vice president of Made in Mexico, a 
Chula Vista company that helps U.S. companies considering a move to Mexico, 
said U.S. furniture and cabinet manufacturers opened the most Baja plants in 
1988. Southern California furniture makers have been under strong pressure from 
air pollution authorities to reduce some pollutants produced by their painting 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The growth in 1988 was much higher than anyone anticipated," Ramirez said. 
"But we're seeing the same old problems crop up, specifically a strong burden 
on the availability of power. It's taking a long time (for maquiladoras) to get 
hooked up because of high demand." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Doyle, a broker with Coldwell Banker commercial real estate in San Diego 
who tracks the Tijuana real estate market, said there was a slowdown of 
interest by U.S. firms in maquiladoras in mid-1988 because of the political 
uncertainty after the election of Mexico's president. But demand picked up by 
year-end and continues strong. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle expects about 2 million square feet of industrial buildings to be leased 
or bought by foreign firms in Tijuana in 1989, up from about 1.5 million square 
feet in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Ascolani said the Mexican federal government will make greater efforts in 1989 
to improve the strained infrastructure but said the government will lean on the 
developers of industrial parks and their tenants to help fund the improvements. 
Ascolani said he expects the number of maquiladora permits in 1989 to equal 
those of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Total maquiladoras in Mexico totaled about 1,500 at year-end, up from 1,250 at 
the end of 1987, Ascolani said.

The Taiwan dollar soared Monday to its highest level in almost 30 years against 
the U.S. currency as banks and exporters dumped the U.S. dollar amid reports 
that Washington was pressing for a stronger Taiwan currency. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the Central Bank intervened only moderately to stem the rise of 
the local dollar after newspaper reports Saturday said Washington wanted 
currency talks later this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan dollar surged by 16 Taiwan cents to close at 27.87 per U.S. dollar. 
The U.S. currency meanwhile surged against other currencies on world markets, 
hitting a 2 1/2-month high of 1.8325 West German marks in New York early Monday 
before the U.S. Federal Reserve and European central banks intervened. 
</P>
<P>
A Central Bank official said Monday's jump, which matched the record for a 
single-day appreciation on Nov. 1, catapulted the Taiwan dollar to a level that 
it has not seen since the late 1950s. Exact dates were not available.

COFFEE FUTURES FALL IN TECHNICAL SELLOFF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Speculators bailed out of the coffee futures market Monday in a frantic, 
technically inspired selloff on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange 
although fundamental factors continued to point toward higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, frozen pork belly futures plunged, soybeans fell sharply, 
precious metals were mixed, energy futures rose and stock index futures 
advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Most coffee futures contracts settled 6 cents a pound lower, the permitted 
daily limit for price movement. The limitless contracts for delivery in March 
and May settled 9.43 and 8.75 cents lower, respectively, with March finishing 
at $1.4829 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
"What we saw today was a wholesale bailout of speculative longs," or players 
who previously had bet that prices would rise, said Kim Badenhop, a coffee 
market analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that after reaching a 27-month high of $1.669 a pound last 
Tuesday, coffee was brought down by profit taking by Friday's close to levels 
that triggered Monday's selloff. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in coffee prices during December was rooted in tight-supply, 
strong-demand fundamentals, including a drought in the coffee-growing regions 
of Brazil and the arrival of winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the annual peak 
period for coffee consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said those factors remained in place. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-term fundamentals suggest we would move to the upside, but it gets 
kind of scary when you get selloffs like this," Badenhop said. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork bellies for both February and March delivery plunged the 
2-cents-a-pound limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in reaction to the 
Agriculture Department's Friday report of a 2% increase in the number of pigs 
expected to be born from December through February. Hog and cattle futures 
finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Live cattle settled 0.30 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with February at 73.55 
cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.10 to 0.62 cent higher, with January at 
84.97 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.75 cent lower to 0.35 cent higher, with 
February at 46.37 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 2 cents lower to 
0.80 cent higher, with February at 42.45 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Soybean futures fell as much as 12 cents a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade 
on forecasts for rain in Argentina, the world's fourth-largest soybean 
producer, where early growing conditions have been dry. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat and corn futures finished mostly higher, although those markets also were 
pressured late in the trading session by the Argentine rain forecasts. Oats 
ended sharply lower.

SALE TO MINORITY TEAM MAY REAP TAX BENEFITS; 
</P>
<P>
NEW YORK TIMES AGREES TO SELL CABLE SYSTEM 
</P>

<P>
The New York Times Co. said Monday that it has agreed to sell its cable 
television system for $420 million to a venture that will be managed by a 
minority investment group. 
</P>
<P>
The price amounts to nearly $2,600 per subscriber, which industry analysts said 
made it one of the more expensive cable system sales to date. 
</P>
<P>
Because the sale was to a minority-managed venture, the deal may also qualify 
for tax advantages that would boost its effective value to the Times. 
</P>
<P>
Parties to the transaction also said it would be the nation's biggest cable 
television system with sizable minority ownership. 
</P>
<P>
J. Bruce Llewellyn, who heads a soft drink bottling concern in Philadelphia and 
is one of the nation's top black business executives, will head the minority 
group being assembled that will manage and have at least a 20% interest in the 
new cable venture. 
</P>
<P>
The other investors, which will split evenly the remaining ownership in the 
venture, are two cable TV companies based in the Philadelphia area, Comcast 
Corp., the nation's fourth-largest cable operator, and Lenfest Communications 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The system being sold is NYT Cable TV of Cherry Hill, N.J., which serves 
162,000 subscribers in 59 communities in southern New Jersey, a suburban area 
that analysts said should prove attractive to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
The Times had put the cable system up for sale in late October, saying it 
wanted to concentrate on its core businesses that include newspapers, 
magazines, broadcasting and forest products. It bought the system in 1981 when 
it had about 72,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
David Gorham, chief financial officer for New York Times Co., said the Times 
expects to record an after-tax gain of about $183 million, or $2.34 per share, 
on the sale. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter after various 
federal regulators complete their review. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the minority group's involvement in the purchase, the Times 
requested that the Federal Communications Commission grant a tax certificate in 
connection with the sale that will entitle the Times to defer payment of about 
$138 million in taxes on the transaction, Gorham said. 
</P>
<P>
The tax-deferral provision was created by Congress in 1978 to encourage 
minority ownership of communications companies. The minority group must be the 
managing partner for the deal to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
Gorham declined to say how much the deferment would mean to the Times, but 
others familiar with the deal said that during negotiations with a number of 
prospective buyers, the Times valued it at $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
That would push the effective value of the deal to the Times to $2,932 per 
subscriber.

FEAR OF FOREIGNERS OWNING DEFENSE CONTRACTOR; 
</P>
<P>
BRITISH TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE BID TO TAKE OVER GEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The British government Monday announced a preliminary probe into a possible 
takeover bid worth $12 billion by an international consortium for Britain's 
largest manufacturing firm, General Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric, which is not related to the U.S. company having the same 
name, vowed Monday to fight a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
The government's Office of Fair Trading said it would look into the possible 
bid as political pressure built on the Conservative government to block any 
move to let the defense and electronics giant fall into foreign hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We are talking about a major British engineering company, the heart of our 
defense industry and the heart of our heavy engineering industry," said John 
Edmonds, leader of the powerful General and Municipal Boilermakers' Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vague and Inconclusive' 
</P>
<P>
The Office of Fair Trading was expected to recommend within days whether a bid, 
if declared formally, should go to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which 
has veto power. 
</P>
<P>
GEC described as "vague and inconclusive" a weekend announcement that 
investment banker Lazard Bros. &amp; Co. had formed a new firm, Metsun Ltd., to 
consider a proposal for GEC, estimated to be worth at least $12.25 billion (7 
billion pounds). 
</P>
<P>
Barclays Bank confirmed that it is heading a syndicate trying to raise money 
for an offer, which newspapers expect to involve U.S. and French firms as well 
as GEC's main British rival, Plessey PLC. 
</P>
<P>
Lazard Bros. is investment banking adviser for Plessey, which itself is the 
target of a $3 billion (1.7 billion pound) joint bid launched in November by 
GEC and West Germany's Siemens AG. GEC charged that Plessey was using 
"ill-considered" tactics to fight the Anglo-German bid. 
</P>
<P>
"This appears to be a self-interested attempt by the board of Plessey and its 
advisers to form a consortium to break up the GEC and thereby save Plessey, in 
the short term, regardless of the cost to British industry in terms of lost 
opportunities and lost jobs," a GEC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Politics vs. Competition 
</P>
<P>
Lazard made its announcement at a key point. On Friday, Plessey unleashed its 
formal defense document against the GEC-Siemens offer, on which the Office of 
Fair Trading must rule by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
Stock analysts said a bid for GEC would test the government's insistence that 
competition considerations and not politics were paramount in takeover policy. 
</P>
<P>
They said it was unlikely the government would allow a takeover of GEC, whose 
Marconi defense subsidiary supplies the government through a consortium 
including big U.S. and French firms. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers named possible participants in a bid as U.S. firms American 
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, General Electric Co. and French electronics giant 
Thomson CSF, as well as British telecommunications firm STC. The companies 
refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Banking sources said a loan facility of $6 billion (3.5 billion pounds) was 
anticipated -- the largest loan ever raised in a takeover bid for a British 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 million GEC shares changed hands on the stock exchange Monday, and 
the frenzied activity sent their price up 38 pence (66 cents) to 2.40 pounds at 
one point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$1.2 Billion in Pretax Profit 
</P>
<P>
Plessey fought off an earlier GEC takeover approach two years ago and since the 
GEC-Siemens bid was announced, it has talked to several international groups 
about a counter-bid. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say predators would be interested in various parts of GEC, which 
employs 157,000 people and last year declared pretax profit of $1.2 billion 
(708 million pounds) on revenue of $9.7 billion (5.5 billion pounds). 
</P>
<P>
GEC products range from domestic appliances to defense radar and avionics for 
British missiles and tanks.

WESTERN DIGITAL TO CUT 290 JOBS IN IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the last phase of its plan to reduce its total work force by 12%, 
Irvine-based Western Digital plans to eliminate 200 of its 2,700 permanent jobs 
in Irvine and terminate 90 contract workers there by the end of March, the 
company announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The cuts will be made at Western Digital's circuit board manufacturing plant 
and will not affect workers at the company's corporate headquarters or at its 
chip manufacturing facilities in Irvine, a company spokesman said. Western 
Digital also said it has eliminated through attrition 400 jobs in Singapore 
since August. And it has laid off 40 employees in Northern California, 140 
employees in Puerto Rico and 80 employees in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital Chairman and Chief Executive Roger W. Johnson said the cutbacks 
reflect the company's attempt to achieve greater operating efficiency and to 
respond to a slowdown in the growth of demand for its products. Western Digital 
is one of the nation's largest suppliers of electronic components to the 
personal computer market. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said the reductions reflect increased use of new, more 
efficient technology that makes it possible to automate a significant portion 
of the circuit board manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
"Western Digital's rate of growth has slowed from the tremendous pace the 
company experienced in recent years," Johnson said. He said he expects the 
company's revenue expansion to drop from 65% in fiscal 1988 to 15% to 20% in 
fiscal 1989 ending June 30.

JENNY CRAIG PROGRAM PROVES A HEAVYWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOT KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Weiner is no stranger to dieting. "I would start a diet every Monday 
morning, which would last until Monday afternoon," said Weiner, a director for 
a San Diego sports photography agency. 
</P>
<P>
Then one day a photographer snapped Weiner's picture. Weiner didn't like what 
he saw. After researching several options, he signed up at a Jenny Craig Weight 
Loss Centre. 
</P>
<P>
Why Jenny Craig? "A friend spoke highly of them; I was attracted by their ads, 
and I liked them financially," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
6th-Fastest-Growing 
</P>
<P>
That recipe has the Carlsbad-based Jenny Craig cooking. Since it opened 14 
facilities in Los Angeles in 1985, the company has emerged as a heavyweight in 
the weight-loss industry. It is also the sixth-fastest-growing privately held 
company in America, according to Inc. magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine estimated Jenny Craig's 1987 revenues at nearly $45 million, with 
each center averaging annualized sales of about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the company's sales jumped to $87 million, and they could reach $120 
million in 1989, according to Sid Craig, the company's co-founder, chairman and 
husband of Jenny Craig. Unlike Bartles and James, of wine cooler fame, she is a 
real person. 
</P>
<P>
Profits ran between 11% and 15% of revenues in 1987, according to Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The company has 120 locations, including 8 in San Diego and 40 in Los Angeles. 
But this is just the beginning, according to the firm: Jenny Craig has plans to 
blanket the nation with 1,000 centers by 1993, half franchised and half 
company-owned. At full strength, it hopes to have 1,200 units generating $1.2 
billion in sales a year. 
</P>
<P>
The weight-loss market is huge. A 1986 consumer survey conducted by the Calorie 
Control Council, an industry trade association, found 65 million Americans 
actively dieting. Every year, about 50% of all women and 25% of all men try to 
shed unsightly pounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Apparently a Trend' 
</P>
<P>
The most popular method is substituting low-calorie foods -- a 
$40-billion-a-year industry -- for high-calorie ones. Americans spend another 
$5 billion on diet books and fad diets. And, said Russell Lemiuex, spokesman 
for the Calorie Control Council in Atlanta, every year about 11% of all adult 
women and 3% of adult men attend weight-loss classes. 
</P>
<P>
"That is apparently a trend," said Sharon Denny, nutrition information 
coordinator for the American Dietetic Assn. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
And the trend is big business. For example, Idaho-based Diet Centers, founded 
in 1970, now has 2,300 centers open and grossed more than $200 million last 
year. Nutri/System, founded in 1971 and headquartered outside Philadelphia, has 
1,067 locations and grossed a record $232 million in corporate revenues in 
fiscal 1988. And Weight Watchers, perhaps the pioneer in the field, estimates 
it has served more than 37 million people in 24 countries since 1963. More than 
a million people attend Weight Watchers meetings annually. 
</P>
<P>
Sid and Jenny Craig launched Jenny Craig Weight Loss Centres in 1982, after 
selling Body Contour, a Los Angeles-based chain of weight-loss and exercise 
centers. Although the deal made them multimillionaires, they didn't walk away 
with as much profit as they had hoped. Plus, neither felt old enough to retire. 
</P>
<P>
A two-year, non-compete clause meant they could not open another Body 
Contour-like program in the United States. So they decided to concentrate on a 
nutritional approach to weight loss and open shop in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
They spent one year and $1 million to develop a line of private-label foods. On 
May 9, 1983, they opened nine centers in Melbourne. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Instantly Successful 
</P>
<P>
The centers were not instant successes. First, the Craigs discovered that the 
Australian palette differs from the American. Then the Australian equivalent of 
the U. S. Food and Drug Administration demanded that the Craigs dump 100,000 
boxes of vitamins into the ocean because they contained a substance that was 
prescription-only in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
But the Craigs' thorniest problem was the fact that, until they arrived, 
Australia had no weight-loss centers at all. 
</P>
<P>
A sustained marketing blitz solved that problem and, within two years, the 
Craigs opened 100 centers in Australia, 10 in New Zealand and several in 
London. They were grossing $40 million a year. It was time to return home, 
which they did with a vengeance in 1985, spending $4 million in advertising to 
make their name known. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, customers pay $185 for as much weekly private and group 
counseling as it takes to reach an ideal weight. For $99, they get another year 
of counseling to help keep the pounds off. An optional set of motivational 
tapes costs $75. 
</P>
<P>
And then there is the food. Until half the weight is lost, customers must eat 
only Jenny Craig meals, supplemented by fruits and vegetables bought in the 
supermarket. Each of the first two weeks' worth of menus costs $70 to $75. 
Thereafter, the week's grocery bill falls to $50 to $60. Beginning at the 
halfway mark, dieters are slowly weaned from the Jenny Craig cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is very expensive," said Evelyn Tribole, a registered dietitian 
based in Newport Beach, author of the book "Eating on the Run" and a 
spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Price a Factor 
</P>
<P>
"We are about half the price of others," Sid Craig countered, although the firm 
plans to raise its prices this month. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Jenny Craig spokeswoman, to lose 30 pounds with Nutri/System, 
the firm's most direct competitor, costs $300 to $500 in service charges and 
$50 a week for food. 
</P>
<P>
Weight Watchers costs $30 to sign up and $8 per meeting. Diet Center programs 
cost $400 to $500. Neither provides private-label food. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went in, I had made up my mind that, if Jenny Craig's price wasn't 
ridiculous, I would do it," said Frank Sonntag, a newspaper circulation 
director in Oceanside. "It wasn't cheap, but it was a good investment." Sonntag 
said he has lost 27 pounds in two months. 
</P>
<P>
The Jenny Craig menus provide about 1,000 calories a day for women and 1,200 
for men. 
</P>
<P>
"One thousand calories is pretty low," said Densie Webb, editor of 
Environmental Nutrition newsletter of New York, which compared diet centers in 
1987. "Customers should be watched by professionals, especially if they are 
used to 3,000 calories a day." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Widely Used Figure 
</P>
<P>
"You can get into nutrient deficiencies under 1,200 calories," acknowledged 
Robyn Moss, Jenny Craig's director of nutritional programs and a registered 
dietitian. "But to lose weight, 1,000 calories is the most widely used 
distribution." 
</P>
<P>
Moss said the Jenny Craig plan provides well-balanced meals, meets federally 
established nutritional standards and uses vitamin supplements. Moreover, she 
said, in her experience doctors invariably approve 1,000-calorie-a-day diets 
for weight loss. (The Diet Centers and Nutri/System programs also target 1,000 
calories a day.) 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Harris, editor of Current Diet Review and a nutritionist for the San 
Bernardino Unified School District, has reviewed the Jenny Craig meal plans. 
"The program is nutritionally balanced and, since fruits and vegetables are not 
tightly controlled, 950 to 1,000 calories is not dangerous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris assumes that, if people are hungry, they cheat a little. So does Moss. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the size of the market and the potential long-term harm that can come 
from a poorly devised weight-loss program, the weight-loss industry is 
virtually unregulated. The FDA has established labeling guidelines for food and 
will intercede when medicinal claims are made. Otherwise, said the American 
Dietetic Assn.'s Tribole, "it is a free-for-all. Anybody can hang up a shingle 
and say they are a nutritionist." 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the most important marketing strategies are word of mouth and 
testimonials. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Through Referrals 
</P>
<P>
Although Sid Craig has actor Elliott Gould, "Sun Up San Diego's" Jerry Bishop 
and KJQY's Claudine St. Clair pitching for him, "about 50% of our customers 
come through referrals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Phyllis of Vista, who asked that her last name not be used, lost 
57 pounds in the Jenny Craig program. Today, four of her relatives are 
involved. And her daughter works as a counselor for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
Dietitians agree that a successful weight-loss program must change the 
customer's long-term eating habits. The trick to losing weight -- eating less, 
exercising more -- is simple. Keeping the weight off is more difficult. Weight 
that constantly yo-yos can be more dangerous to a person's health than being a 
little overweight. 
</P>
<P>
After only two years in America, Jenny Craig has not conducted any long-term 
studies to see how many of its customers have kept their weight down. Nor has 
Nutri/System. Diet Centers says that, one year after its customers finish the 
program, 54% are still at their ideal weight and 79% are within 10 pounds.

IT'S A LONG WAY FROM WALL ST. TO ENCINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Milken may well be the best-known name on Wall Street. But on Ventura 
Boulevard, just a few blocks from his home, he is something of a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
In a highly unscientific survey last week, the Times queried 100 people in 
Encino, the San Fernando Valley suburb where Milken grew up and still lives, 
and at Birmingham High School, where Milken graduated 25 years ago, to gauge 
how well known he is in his own back yard. People were picked at random in a 
telephone survey or asked to fill out a questionnaire in person. 
</P>
<P>
Only a third of the people surveyed could correctly identify the Drexel Burnham 
Lambert executive and philanthropist as the nation's premier junk bondsman and 
subject of a huge federal stock-fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
And the rest? They listed Milken as everything from Encino's mayor to 
heavyweight champ Mike Tyson's divorce lawyer, a space shuttle astronaut, the 
new editor of The Times, the inventor of the fax machine and a character out of 
the television series "thirtysomething." Some confused him with New York 
developer Donald Trump, computer whiz Steve Jobs and Walt Disney Co. Chairman 
Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
Because the survey was unscientific, definitive conclusions can't be drawn from 
the results. Still, they suggest that Milken is far from a household name -- 
even in his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere I've read his name, but I don't know of him. Is he an entertainer?" 
asked Alan Stein, a comic and producer at Encino's L.A. Cabaret comedy club 
whose response was typical. 
</P>
<P>
Which isn't surprising. Other, professional surveys indicate that business 
people are not nearly as well known as entertainers. According to Marketing 
Evaluations, a Port Washington, N.Y., market research firm, the top celebrity 
in familiarity and appeal in most recent surveys was entertainer Bill Cosby 
with a 96% score, followed by actor Michael J. Fox at 90%. Chrysler Chairman 
Lee Iacocca scores about 71%, with Playboy founder Hugh Hefner at 67%. 
</P>
<P>
Milken certainly isn't lacking for publicity. A database survey of the nation's 
largest newspapers, magazines and wire services showed that last year Milken's 
name appeared in no fewer than 250 headlines. That does not include countless 
other Milken-related stories on Drexel or others touched by the insider trading 
scandal, such as imprisoned stock speculator Ivan Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Milken's lack of name recognition comes as no surprise to Kenneth Lerer, his 
personal spokesman. "Michael has said he has never sought the spotlight. He 
wants his kids to grow up in a very normal fashion," Lerer said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent attention, it is unlikely that Milken, 42, is even Encino's 
most famous resident. That probably is singer Michael Jackson, who reportedly 
plans to move to a ranch near Santa Barbara this spring, but keep his Encino 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Milken is undoubtedly Encino's wealthiest resident. Last year, Forbes magazine 
estimated his fortune at $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
He got that way by creating the market for "junk bonds," which are high-yield, 
high-risk debt securities. Believing that many good companies were shunned from 
the financial markets, Milken from his Beverly Hills office built junk bonds 
into a market worth more than $160 billion, prompting some to call him the most 
important American financier since J.P. Morgan. But he also became 
controversial as the junk bonds he developed were used to fuel the ambitions of 
takeover specialists such as Revlon Chairman Ronald Perelman and TWA Chairman 
Carl C. Icahn. 
</P>
<P>
Milken also is becoming increasingly known through his charitable empire. He 
and his wife donated $196 million to their three charitable foundations in 
1987, according to recent state records. Also, Milken has been seen 
increasingly at public events such as baseball games with disadvantaged youths 
he is helping. 
</P>
<P>
Most of his notoriety, however, has come from being the target of a massive 
government stock-fraud investigation. In September, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission accused him in a civil lawsuit of insider trading, manipulating 
stock prices and having an illegal stock-trading arrangement with Boesky. 
Milken has denied the SEC charges. He is expected to be indicted soon in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the notoriety that came with the insider trading scandal, few of the 
100 people queried last week knew details of Milken's predicament, even if they 
knew in general what he does for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know he's in a lot of trouble," said Henry Lipson, who has had a 
pharmacy on Ventura Boulevard in Encino since 1955. 
</P>
<P>
The Encino survey was done in two parts. The first involved distributing 
questionnaires to 66 people along Encino's main street, Ventura Boulevard, and 
at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. No one was told it was a newspaper survey. The 
questionnaires asked "Who is Michael Milken?" and offered a choice of 20 
answers to choose from. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 66 responses, 21, or slightly fewer than one-third, correctly identified 
Milken. The rate would have been lower had it not been for a group of students 
taking an accounting class at Birmingham, who presumably knew him because of 
their interest in business. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the other results: 
</P>
<P>
9% of the respondents picked Milken as Encino's mayor. Encino does not have its 
own mayor, except for the celebrities who serve as honorary ones, because it is 
part of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
8% identified him as Tyson's divorce lawyer. (Howard Weitzman is Tyson's 
lawyer.) Another 8% thought Milken was the county supervisor -- Mike Antonovich 
-- who was reelected in November over Baxter Ward. And 8% more thought Milken 
was the Times' new editor. (Shelby Coffey III is the new editor.) 
</P>
<P>
6% confused Milken with President-elect George Bush's choice to be Treasury 
secretary, Nicholas Brady. 
</P>
<P>
5% said he was the New York real estate developer and Atlantic City casino 
owner Donald Trump or computer pioneer Jobs. Still another 5% of those 
questioned thought Milken was a "thirtysomething" character. 
</P>
<P>
3% said he was a crew member on the space shuttle Discovery. Another 3% 
answered that Milken was the inventor of the fax machine. And about 3% thought 
Milken was an unsuccessful Oscar nominee for best actor last year. 
</P>
<P>
The other part of the survey involved asking 25 Encino residents, whose names 
were randomly selected from the telephone book and 9 local community or 
business leaders, whether they could identify Milken. 
</P>
<P>
He was easily identified by Steve Edwards, a Los Angeles talk-show host who 
serves this year as Encino's honorary mayor, and Jan Sobel, executive director 
of the Encino Chamber of Commerce. So did Larry Buck, who sells hot dogs from a 
cart at Encino Park near Milken's home. 
</P>
<P>
But others stumbled. Postmaster Barry Seltzer said he could not identify 
Milken. Also having trouble was Mark Wilson, a professional magician who this 
year is Encino's honorary sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
Milken is largely a stranger today at Birmingham High, where in 1964 he 
practiced high-yield pep as head cheerleader -- along with actress Sally Field 
-- was named prom king and served as a member of the Boys League service 
organization with Michael Ovitz, who went on to become a Hollywood "superagent" 
as head of Creative Artists Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Neal Federman, who teaches an economics class at Birmingham, recalls discussing 
the insider trading scandal last year during one of his classes. He said that 
nearly all of the students did not know who Milken was, even those students who 
live near him. 
</P>
<P>
"Across the board I would say they have no idea who he is," Federman said. Part 
of the reason may be because the school is much different from the neighborhood 
suburban high school it was in Milken's day, with one-third of the 3,100 
students now bused to the school from inner-city areas. 
</P>
<P>
Federman said, however, that one student in the class discovered who Milken was 
after scores of reporters and photographers started hanging around his 
neighborhood, where Milken lives. 
</P>
<P>
The student "had noticed there were people standing outside the house trying to 
talk to Milken or waiting to get a picture of him as he emerged," Federman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHO IS MICHAEL MILKEN? Junk bond king Mike Milken is one of the best known 
names on Wall Street, but what about on Ventura Boulevard? As part of an 
unscientific survey, 66 people were asked to identify Milken on a 
questionnaire. Those surveyed were in his hometown of Encino or at Birmingham 
High School in Van Nuys, where he graduated in 1964. Less than one in three 
correctly identified him. Incorrect answers are also listed below.*

ANTI-ANEMIA DRUG FINALLY GETS CLOSE TO CIRCULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY STAVRO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The magic potion is a clear liquid packed in vials and kept refrigerated in a 
Thousand Oaks warehouse while it sits waiting to be sold. It's the latest 
biotechnology drug, called erythropoietin, or EPO, an anti-anemia treatment 
that, after seven years and $70 million in research and development, will be 
the first commercial product of a company called Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a product for which there is no alternative," said George Rathmann, 
Amgen's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen is doing all it can to get off to a fast start. "Running out of material 
is unacceptable," said Gordon Binder, Amgen's chief executive. So Amgen's new 
manufacturing plant is up and running and has turned out a three-month supply 
of EPO while Amgen is hiring salespeople and has lined up refrigerated 
warehouses around the country to keep the drug fresh. 
</P>
<P>
Everything is ready save one thing. Amgen still needs U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration approval to sell the drug. 
</P>
<P>
No one expects the FDA to reject Amgen's request to sell EPO, a hormone that 
triggers production of red blood cells, that in clinical tests successfully 
treated the chronic anemia suffered by patients with kidney disease. EPO was 
discovered by scientists in 1906, but the body produces only microscopic 
amounts of the hormone, and the challenge has been how to get enough of it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Able to Make Drug 
</P>
<P>
But in biotechnology, scientists are medical detectives who by resplicing 
genes, which carry the blueprints of life, can trigger production of rare 
hormones and proteins so they can be used as a therapeutic drug. Amgen has 
submitted 40,000 pages of supporting documents and conducted extensive EPO 
tests on patients, winning glowing reviews in the New England Journal of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen's executives had hoped that the FDA would complete its elaborate review 
and approve EPO for sale by late 1988. Now the company is "very optimistic" 
that the drug will be approved for sale by March, Binder said. 
</P>
<P>
During the wait, Amgen's stock has bounced up and down on each scrap of news 
about the FDA's approval process. Financial analysts still expect Amgen to be 
the first company to win approval to sell EPO because it applied to the FDA 
more than a year ahead of any other company. 
</P>
<P>
And with that approval will come riches. What is unnerving, though, is that no 
one seems certain how plentiful those riches will be. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Amgen's stock spurted when an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton 
predicted worldwide sales for EPO of $3.5 billion, with $1.8 billion in the 
United States by 1993. Binder said that the figure was preposterous. "We just 
find it hard to accept a plan on any drug selling more than $1 billion, no 
matter what it cures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Excited About Amgen' 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Montgomery Securities analyst Denise Gilbert made her own projection 
that EPO would sell no more than $450 million in the United States by 1993, and 
the stock dipped. "I'm excited about Amgen and find EPO a compelling story. But 
I'm trying to deflate expectations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that the stock market has lost much of its confidence in 
biotechnology and fears that only a few companies out of the hundreds will 
actually produce drugs that are big winners. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen has much at risk. The company has five other drugs undergoing tests in 
humans, but EPO has secured the little company's reputation and boosted the 
value of Amgen's stock to $550 million, even though until now it essentially 
has been without a product to sell. Last year Amgen earned $1.7 million on 
sales of $53 million, but those figures are a mirage. The sales are primarily 
advances from the company's research and development partners, while the 
"profits" are from investments. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market is also pessimistic about biotechnology because of the many 
misadventures of Genentech, the San Francisco biotech company whose reputation 
took a terrible beating last year. A year ago Genentech's stock was trading at 
$47 per share and there was no end to the enthusiasm for its latest drug, TPA, 
an anti-blood-clotting agent that could save heart attack victims. The drug 
would sell $400 million in its first year, analysts boasted, and Genentech's 
executives did nothing to discourage those expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Genentech ended up selling about $175 million worth of TPA in 1988, still a 
record for first year sales of a new drug, but the stock collapsed and now 
languishes at $17. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? The drug was expensive -- at $2,200 a dose TPA is 10 times the 
price of older heart attack drugs -- and various studies were inconclusive 
about TPA's advantages over other drugs. Only last month, Genentech wrote off 
$25 million worth of TPA inventory because the drug is perishable and sales 
were far slower than the company's optimistic projections. 
</P>
<P>
Binder says he learned from Genentech's troubles. "You don't want to spend 
money making something you're not going to use. In some industries you have a 
big sale and mark the price down. That's not possible in pharmaceuticals." 
</P>
<P>
Lesson No. 2, Binder said is: "We try to have reasonable expectations about 
Amgen's results." Gilbert recently trimmed her 1990 profit estimates for Amgen 
after the company's executives told her what they would need to spend to get 
EPO into the market. 
</P>
<P>
Still, most analysts figure Amgen has a big winner in EPO. The biggest use will 
be to help treat patients who undergo kidney dialysis to cleanse impurities 
from their blood. Those patients cannot produce enough red blood cells and many 
of them need transfusions of up to four quarts of blood a month. But patients 
injected with EPO didn't need the transfusions and were able go about their 
lives more normally. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage companies to come up with drugs to treat relatively rare diseases, 
Congress awards so-called "orphan drug status," a seven-year exclusive 
franchise, to the first manufacturer of such drugs. EPO qualifies as an orphan 
drug and Amgen has shrewdly kept the rights to sell EPO to kidney dialysis 
patients. Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter, says 
that is likely to be a $200-million-a-year market in this country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Possible Uses 
</P>
<P>
EPO may also work in treating other kinds of anemia, including chemotherapy and 
leukemia patients. EPO is also being tested with AZT, an AIDS treatment drug 
that produces anemia as a side effect. Sales of EPO to patients other than 
those with kidney disease would be open to other companies with their own 
versions of EPO, but analysts can't agree on how big that market will be. 
Johnson &amp; Johnson will sell Amgen's version of EPO for other, disparate 
uses in this country while paying Amgen a royalty, estimated by analysts at 8% 
of gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
By Gilbert's reckoning, Amgen's profits will grow like a weed, from $15 million 
for the March, 1990, fiscal year, to $83 million in 1993. By then, she figures 
Amgen's second drug, G-CSF, which produces white blood cells, will strike gold 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Amgen wins the EPO race from the laboratory to the marketplace, it must 
still win a battle of wits in the courtroom to ensure its profits. 
</P>
<P>
Amgen is now locked in four patent-infringement lawsuits with its chief rival, 
Genetics Institute, a biotech company, which with Chugai Pharmaceutical of 
Tokyo is racing to get its own version of EPO approved for sale in the United 
States. Most analysts figure that Genetics Institute, with headquarters in 
Cambridge, Mass., is at least a year behind Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
Both Amgen and Genetics Institute have separate, seemingly conflicting patents 
relating to EPO, and it could take years for the cases to go all the way 
through to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Until the cases are resolved, both 
companies should be free to sell the new drug, but whichever company wins in 
court figures to take home the biggest share of profits. 
</P>
<P>
Genetics Institute has been willing to discuss an out-of-court settlement with 
Amgen, presumably for some sort of cross-licensing deal in which both could 
sell the drug, but Amgen's executives have refused. "We're so far apart there's 
nothing to discuss," Binder said.

ON THE ROAD TO DESIGNING CAR OF 1990S; 
</P>
<P>
DRIVEN BY A STEADY DECLINE IN SALES, GENERAL MOTORS TO GIVE ANTIQUATED CAMARO A 
FACE-LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in 1964, General Motors Corp. had a big problem. Lee Iacocca and Ford 
Motor Co. had introduced a sporty, two-door car called the Mustang, and it 
quickly became a hit. To catch up, GM's Chevrolet division designed a car to 
match the Mustang, and unveiled the new model in 1967. Its name: Camaro, taken 
loosly from the French word for "comrade" or "friend." 
</P>
<P>
Like the Mustang, the Chevrolet Camaro became a best-selling domestic sports 
car for two decades, but today the Camaro is but one of many problems for GM. 
Camaro sales have steadily dropped the last four years, adding to a slide in 
GM's overall share of the U.S. car market to 36% from 43% five years ago. Last 
year, about 100,000 Camaros were driven off Chevy showrooms, down from 202,200 
in 1984, says J.D. Power &amp; Associates, an automotive research firm in 
Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Few Changes 
</P>
<P>
The auto business is a lot like the fashion industry, and critics deride the 
current Camaro model as an automotive dinosaur, with a bulky, garish design 
inside and out that makes the car look dated compared to today's sleek sports 
cars, such as the Toyota Supra and Nissan 240SX. The Camaro's looks have 
changed little since 1982 and by automobile standards, the Camaro needs a 
face-lift. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustang also is based on a design several years old. But periodic updates 
in Mustang's body, suspension and horsepower -- together with a generally lower 
sticker price -- enabled Mustang to outsell Camaro by nearly 2 to 1 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Now GM is trying to engineer a Camaro comeback for the next decade, starting in 
1992 when the company will roll out a redesigned version of the car. GM won't 
disclose specifics on what the car looks like but said the 1992 model takes 
some of its styling from a radical "concept" Camaro that was created at a cost 
of $500,000 by GM's Advanced Concepts Center in Newbury Park and built by a 
small Burbank firm, Acsco Automobile Development. 
</P>
<P>
The concept Camaro, a futuristic car shaped like a bullet, was on display last 
week at the Greater Los Angeles Auto Show and "is quite a ways advanced" 
compared to the Camaro that will be sold in 1992, said Robert D. Burger, 
general manager and the top executive at Chevrolet. The 1992 Camaro will use a 
blend of the current model and the concept car, Burger said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it looks like, the 1992 Camaro could have a major impact on Los 
Angeles. GM builds its Camaros and Firebirds at its assembly plant in Van Nuys, 
but the plant's contract runs out in 1991. GM has not yet decided whether to 
award the new models to Van Nuys, although a decision is expected within a few 
months. Even if Van Nuys does get to build the new models, the plant's 
long-term future will rest on whether GM can breathe new life into the car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Loud' 
</P>
<P>
Opinions vary about why the Camaro slumped. Ron Sessions, an editor for Road 
&amp; Track magazine, is a Camaro fan, but he said that "they are cop catchers" 
prone to getting tickets, and that "they are loud." 
</P>
<P>
Drivers also have been turned off by Camaro's high insurance costs, 
particularly in California, where one-third of all Camaros are sold. Even with 
a good driving record, a single, 30-year-old driver could pay more than $1,500 
a year for insurance on the least powerful Camaro. "Insurance is killing the 
Camaro market," Sessions said. 
</P>
<P>
Camaro drivers also tend to be in more accidents than drivers of most other 
cars in its class, said Rick Dinon, a spokesman for 20th Century Insurance in 
Woodland Hills. In fact, 20th Century and Allstate Insurance won't even insure 
the IROC-Z -- the most powerful Camaro -- because they consider the car too 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
And Camaro's price tag, which can exceed $20,000 for an IROC-Z, steadily 
climbed above Mustang's price in recent years by $1,500 to $5,000, a 
not-so-inconsequential amount to Camaro's target audience of drivers under age 
40. Buyers noticed. Ford sold nearly 170,000 Mustangs last year. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to last week's auto show, Chevrolet's Burger conceded, "we lost 
of lot of business" to Mustang because of the price difference. He also 
admitted that GM neglected Camaro's styling. "We let the car go quite a long 
time," Burger said. "We we sort of put it on the back burner." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Design for Future 
</P>
<P>
To try to revive the Camaro's sales, GM turned to its Advanced Concepts Center 
a year ago to design a Camaro for the mid-1990s with the idea of immediately 
using some of the car's features on its 1992 model. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Cedergren, a J.D. Power analyst, said most auto makers build concept cars 
"not to say to the public that these will be in production, but basically to 
show consumers and the press the level of technical and engineering and design 
prowess the manufacturer has." They also give auto makers a chance to get some 
public opinion before spending millions of dollars on production. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to design cars in a vacuum and say, 'Here: like this,' " said 
James S. Bieck, chief designer at GM's Advanced Concepts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Creating a successful new car is as difficult as creating a new look in 
clothes, because the designer must guess about future tastes in fashion. But 
whereas an apparel designer might be drawing clothes for next fall, car 
designers are creating vehicles that won't go into production for three or four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, former GM Director H. Ross Perot has complained that it takes GM longer 
to get a new car into production than it did for the United States to win World 
War II. Such long lag times increase the odds that the car won't appeal to 
drivers once it finally rolls off the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
California Design 
</P>
<P>
In hopes of coming up with a Camaro design that would sell well in California, 
GM farmed out the design to its California design center. "California sets 
trends," Bieck said, and GM wanted to "get our input, so there's not the 
inbreeding of Detroit. We have another point of view, and we're remote and 
removed." 
</P>
<P>
Once Bieck's staff of 40 got the assignment to rethink the Camaro, "every 
single person, right down to the people in the shop, felt the car was too big, 
the existing car, so we started with the premise of doing a smaller car," Bieck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Each decade, new automobile designs come to be dominant and other car designers 
take cues from it. In the 1980s two of the most important designs were Ford's 
so-called jellybean look, where its cars were overhauled with a more rounded, 
aerodynamic shape, as well as Audi's aerodynamic design where the nose of the 
car was significantly closer to the ground than the tail end. 
</P>
<P>
The Camaro concept car is 15 1/2 feet long, six inches shorter than the 1989 
Camaro, Bieck said. But more importantly, the streamlining of the car's body -- 
with its severely rounded front end that dips to a point, flush-mounted glass 
and side-view mirrors that are built into the body -- makes it look even 
slimmer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to get a more fluid, rounded car yet keep the aggressive quality a 
Camaro should have," Bieck said. His designers sought a "purposeful, lean, 
fast, sleek" look that would give the car "an emotion, a personality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clay Models 
</P>
<P>
The concept car, which is made of steel and has a six-cylinder engine, was 
designed and built in six months by GM's design team and Acsco. GM started by 
making small clay models of several design ideas, and then choosing one style. 
A full-scale clay model of that car was made, and its dimensions were then 
copied into steel by Acsco. 
</P>
<P>
Fancy interior parts also were custom-made. They include a black, padded 
wrap-around dashboard that literally places controls in a sweeping arc from the 
driver's left arm to right. To emphasize the driver, the seat is red; the other 
three seats are black. The car's 18-inch rear tires had to be specially made by 
Goodyear, said Acsco President Tom McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
Will all of this effort restore Camaro's past luster? Cedergren of J.D. Power 
said he's seen drawings of the 1992 model and, although it is more conservative 
than the concept car, "from the rendering I've seen, the car is going to be 
impressive." 
</P>
<P>
But the Camaro's looks won't solve the car's insurance handicap, and it's still 
up to GM to keep its price competitive. Ford won't sit still with the Mustang, 
nor will Camaro's import competitors, such as Toyota and Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Camaro had a new look in 1982, but that alone wasn't enough to 
sustain the car's sales for the next seven years. The Mustang and the imports 
hurt, Cedergren said, "but what affected it much more was a lack of attention 
by GM."

VALLEY ROUNDUP: AME STOCK PLAN ACCEPTS NEW OFFER FOR SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AME said its employee stock ownership plan reached a tentative agreement to 
tender part of its shares to a group led by AME founder and chairman Andrew M. 
McIntyre, which has offered $37 million to buy the 55% of AME that McIntyre 
does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
The employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) owns 1.2 million, or 25%, of AME, a 
Burbank provider of videotape services to the movie and television industries. 
AME last month accepted McIntyre's sweetened offer of $13.75 a share; initially 
he offered $11.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre said in a telephone interview that the ESOP has tentatively agreed to 
tender 35% to 40% of its shares for cash. The remaining shares would be 
exchanged for stock in AOAG, the company McIntyre's group formed to make the 
acquisition.

VALLEY ROUNDUP: VOTE SCHEDULED ON SALE OF NEWHALL RESOURCES' ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Newhall Resources' unit holders are scheduled to vote Jan. 31 on the sale of 
most of the energy company's assets to Newhall Land &amp; Farming for about 
$26.4 million. Unit holders of record Dec. 27 are eligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale, which would be followed by the dissolution of Newhall 
Resources, calls for Newhall Resources' unit holders to be paid about $6 per 
unit. Newhall Resources has 4.4 million units outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Land, a real estate and agriculture concern that is developing the 
community of Valencia, and Newhall Resources are both Valencia-based limited 
partnerships whose investment units trade on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall Resources was created in 1983 when Newhall Land spun off its oil and 
gas assets. Newhall Land is repurchasing the assets mainly to acquire mineral 
rights in the Valencia area, which would help accelerate development of the 
community.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
November sales of existing houses in the Conejo Valley fell 12% from the 
previous month but remained 24% ahead of a year earlier, the Conejo Valley 
Board of Realtors said. 
</P>
<P>
The board said 230 single-family houses were sold in November, down from 262 in 
October but up from 186 in November, 1987. Sales of condominiums followed a 
similar pattern, totaling 330 in November, which was down from 361 in October 
but up from 245 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The average price of a house, meanwhile, fell to $296,906 in November from a 
record high of $303,900 in October, the board said. A year earlier, the average 
price was $236,797. 
</P>
<P>
The report covers sales in Agoura Hills, Westlake Village, Thousand Oaks and 
Newbury Park.

'PHYSICIST' A LOOK AT BIRTH OF NEW IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Privilege of Being a Physicist by Victor F. Weisskopf (W. H. Freeman: 
$17.95; 235 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Progress is not a smooth process. It occurs in fits and starts. So do many 
other processes. History, for example. And thought. 
</P>
<P>
Cultures, societies and individuals stay at one level for a while, turning the 
same ideas over and over in a familiar way, and then something happens that 
presents a new idea. 
</P>
<P>
This process is not well understood, and it is certainly not predictable. Why 
an idea takes hold at one time but not at another is largely a matter of 
chance. The manner of presentation appears to hold the key. Rhetoric may turn 
out to be at least as important as content. 
</P>
<P>
A new idea can't be too far out, or it will be dismissed or ignored. It has to 
be just different enough to be intriguing, but it has to make enough 
connections with what people already believe so that it makes sense. Noam 
Chomsky's radical critique of America may indeed be right, but his starting 
point is so different from most other people's that he does not get much of a 
following. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unpredictable Changes 
</P>
<P>
When changes occur, sometimes they happen quickly and sometimes they take a 
while. Here again, no one can predict which is which. 
</P>
<P>
I mention all this because Victor F. Weisskopf's collected essays, "The 
Privilege of Being a Physicist," contain many ideas that advance familiar 
discussions. "Whenever one way of thinking is developed with great force and 
success, other ways are unduly neglected," he writes. "The one-sided religious 
emphasis of the Middle Ages and the equally one-sided scientific-technological 
emphasis of our time have released creative forces of enormous power. Think of 
the medieval creations of art, architecture, and moral philosophy and of the 
development of science, natural philosophy, and technology in our era." 
</P>
<P>
Weisskopf is a distinguished physicist who has observed almost all of 
20th-Century physics firsthand. He is Institute Professor Emeritus and 
Professor of Physics Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
With his feet thoroughly and unshakably grounded in science, he is able to 
speak about science with remarkable detachment. He sees its strengths and its 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Absolute Definitions 
</P>
<P>
"Important parts of human experience cannot be reasonably evaluated within the 
scientific system," he writes. "There cannot be an all-encompassing scientific 
definition of good and evil, of compassion, of rapture, of tragedy or humor, of 
hate, love, or faith, of dignity and humiliation, or of concepts like the 
quality of life or happiness." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what we learn about neurology or the biochemistry of the brain, he 
argues, "There remain important aspects of these experiences that are not 
touched by the scientific approach. Usually they are the ones most relevant to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
In the course of his long career, Weisskopf worked on the Manhattan Project at 
Los Alamos during World War II, which produced the atomic bomb and which 
impressed the twin themes of science for good and science for evil onto his 
thought. He is, of course, not alone in this dilemma. Many of his co-workers 
from the atom bomb project were understandably scarred by the experience. 
</P>
<P>
But Weisskopf's thoughts have developed beyond hand-wringing. He is not against 
the acquisition of knowledge about nature -- as if anyone could hold back the 
tide anyway. But he views scientific knowledge as inherently limited and 
incomplete. Art and science are both vital ways of thinking, he says. They each 
tell their own truths, and they are both necessary for humanity. Weisskopf's 
analysis of the state of contemporary art is both accurate and bracing, coming 
from a physicist: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Art Is Powerful' 
</P>
<P>
"Many creations of contemporary art, especially literature, deal with the 
tragedy and depth of our lack of purpose and meaning. In this effort our art is 
powerful, heart-rending, and deeply depressing. . . . We do not often enough 
find those ingredients that permeated art in past centuries -- beauty and 
hope." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the essays in the book were written especially for this collection, 
including one that describes quantum mechanics as well as I have ever seen it 
described. There are also delightful portraits of Wolfgang Pauli and Werner 
Heisenberg, two giants of 20th-Century physics with whom Weisskopf worked. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a few of the essays are a little bit flimsy. But it would be 
too much to ask that every page exhibit the same power of thought, abstraction 
and expression that characterizes so much of it. 
</P>
<P>
Weisskopf's insights into physics have led him to insights into the areas of 
life where physics cannot go. His mind works as well in the one as in the 
other. Sharing his thoughts is the privilege of being a reader.

'DECADES' CELEBRATES ENGLISH PHOTO HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Times Art Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Formative Decades: Photography in Great Britain, 1839-1920," at the County 
Museum of Art, kicks off a spate of exhibitions celebrating the 150th birthday 
of photography. 
</P>
<P>
Before the year is over, every photo show in the country will probably be 
billed as a commemorative event, but this one really digs into history. 
</P>
<P>
Containing 130 images from the riches of the Harry Ransom Humanities Research 
Center at the University of Texas at Austin, "The Formative Decades" was 
actually organized for the university's centennial, but it serves very well as 
a toast to the medium. From early images of leaves produced without a camera 
and jewel-like daguerreotype portraits in velvet-lined cases to 1919 X-rays of 
incubating eggs, the exhibition is a captivating journey through photography's 
early, experimental days. 
</P>
<P>
The English penchant for travel -- typified by the Grand Tour -- is reflected 
in many images but it also serves as a metaphor for the entire exhibition. 
English photographers actually lugged glass plates and cumbersome cameras to 
the Egyptian pyramids and took more up-to-date equipment to the Antarctic, as 
we see in works by Francis Frith and Herbert George Ponting. 
</P>
<P>
But even when they stayed at home, the photographers in the exhibition often 
behaved as intrepid explorers in unknown terrain, trying every facet of the new 
medium and every possible application of this democratic art form. Whatever 
else they may be, these pictures are a record of a struggle against technical 
and material limitations. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the images in the show don't look like art; instead, they reflect a 
period when inventive people were trying to figure out what to do with 
photography and how to stretch its capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
The results are sometimes bizarre. An example of "spirit photography," for 
example, depicts a draped female head emerging from another head. Though 
obviously manipulated, this image was collected by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as 
"evidence" of spiritualism. Other pictures occasionally border on the ghoulish: 
portraits of a dead baby, a starving Russian girl and a Zulu prince who was 
about to expire. 
</P>
<P>
More often, the photographs are elaborately posed theatrical compositions or 
relatively straightforward landscapes that tell us a great deal about British 
values and life styles. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most telling are "living" tableaux of costumed characters that 
provided entertaining morality lessons for Victorian and Edwardian citizens. 
Julia Margaret Cameron, represented here by a couple of romantic portraits, was 
the premiere artist of the genre. But we also find Henry Peach Robinson going 
to enormous trouble to combine negatives and studio setups in "When Day's Work 
is Done," a sentimental picture of an elderly couple. 
</P>
<P>
The firm of Hughes and Mullins photographed members of the royal family acting 
out "Idylls of the King," while T. A. Rust posed a devil and an angel in a 
wacky scene called "The Game of Life." Another curiosity is a hand-colored 
stereograph by Alfred Silvester that features peasants beating up on a goose 
dressed as Emperor Louis-Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
Like writers and painters, these Pictorialists were looking for important 
themes. Today, most of their pictures appear to be illustration, though it 
simulates painting and bears some relationship to current 
"fabricated-to-be-photographed" work. 
</P>
<P>
"Straight" photography and street work didn't come into vogue until the 
mid-20th Century, but their counterparts and predecessors are here. Peter Henry 
Emerson, who advocated a "naturalistic" approach, is represented by a 
surprisingly economical image of farmers in a hay field. Horatio Nelson King's 
picture of Hampton Court (circa 1880) is strikingly modern in its emphasis on 
the structure and shadows of a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Other photographs of humble workmen, dramatic waterfalls, rock formations and 
tropical plants document the growth of photography as an amateur sport. 
</P>
<P>
Some portraits reveal an urge to show people as working members of a community 
rather than picture-perfect subjects. Joseph Parkin Mayall's portrait of artist 
Valentine Cameron Prinsep in his studio and W. Currey's shot of Prime Minister 
William Gladstone resting after chopping wood are certainly not candid, but 
they mark an abrupt departure from the properly stiff, staged images that 
predominate. 
</P>
<P>
"The Formative Decade" (to March 19) is a show of details, an exhibition that 
has us peering closely at tiny images or intricate bits of larger ones and sets 
us to questioning the limitations of dozens of techniques. In fact, it's so 
intriguing that we hardly notice how weak it is as an art show. This seems to 
reflect a conscious curatorial decision, however. The point is to demonstrate 
how photography grew up in England and how firmly it was woven into 
middle-class life. 
</P>
<P>
One of the least compelling images illustrates this idea with resounding 
clarity. It's an unidentified photographer's picture of a house in India. Out 
of focus and produced on a broken plate, it was nonetheless preserved in an 
English gentleman's album. More than any other image in the show, this one 
speaks of photography's ability to create a surrogate experience, to conjure up 
a memory that must be preserved.

Veteran Hollywood photographer Murray Garrett can name-drop with the best of 
them: Marlon Brando, Gary Cooper, Bette Davis, Kirk Douglas, Joan Crawford, 
Betty Grable, Tyrone Power, Jane Russell, Lana Turner and Loretta Young. He 
photographed these and many other celebrities during a 27-year career 
(1946-73), and his portraits of familiar faces are on display (through Feb. 17) 
at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills. His first 
assignment in 1942 (when he was 16) was to photograph Eleanor Roosevelt. 
"Things were different then and photographers weren't enemies," says Garrett. 
"I had the good fortune of becoming friendly with these people, and they 
trusted me." ALEENE MacMINN

The "Best Picture" Oscar that producer Michael Todd won in 1956 for "Around The 
World in 80 Days" will go on the auction block next month, the owner of a 
Hollywood memorabilia shop said Monday. It will be the seventh such statuette 
auctioned by Collector's Showcase, said store owner Malcolm Willits, who 
acknowledges that such transactions are controversial. "Selling your Oscar is a 
little like selling your child," he said. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
and Sciences, which annually presents the Oscars, frowns on the auctions. 
Academy spokesman Bruce Davis said, "We find this a very meloncholy turn of 
events." The Academy feels that auctions commercialize the award. The Todd 
Oscar could bring as much as $40,000. The six previous Academy Awards that 
Willits has sold brought an average of $10,000 each. Willits' usually gets the 
Oscars from relatives who have inherited them, and in most cases, the recipient 
is dead. Willit recently auctioned for $17,715 the 1941 set decoration Oscar 
given for "How Green Was My Valley." In March, an Oscar for "The Diary of Anne 
Frank" (given to Lyle Wheeler and George W. Davis for black and white art 
direction) is due to be auctioned.

Styles change in the capital. President-elect George Bush and his wife Barbara 
and some friends showed up unexpectedly over the weekend at the Kennedy Center 
to take in the long-running audience-participation satire "Shear Madness." Two 
weeks earlier, they also went to the center to hear singer Barbara Cook, and 
shortly before that had dinner at a favorite suburban Chinese restaurant. The 
Washington Post says it's an indication that the Bushes aren't stay-at-homes 
and plan to find ways around the tight restrictions of the presidency. During 
their eight years in the White House, President and Mrs. Reagan showed up 
mostly at events where they were expected. ALEENE MacMINN

"42nd Street," the second longest running show on Broadway, closed Sunday after 
eight years and 3,486 performances seen by 10 million people. The musical's 
longevity was second only to that of "A Chorus Line," which opened in 1975. The 
scenery and other equipment are being kept for a possible revival in April with 
an all-black cast. The hit London production of "42nd Street" closed the 
previous day, having played 1,823 performances over 4 1/2 years.ALEENE MacMINN

GREENE QUARTET IN MEKLER GALLERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It seems like yesterday that there were no string quartets dabbling in 
jazz-cum-classical repertory. Now there are at least three, one of which, the 
Greene String Quartet, was heard Sunday in a recital at the Mekler Gallery on 
La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Among their many talents violinist Richard Greene and his violist, Jimbo Ross, 
have the ability to play improvised jazz. This gives them an advantage over the 
Kronos Quartet whose members read meticulously but have to call on outsiders to 
add the ad-lib element. 
</P>
<P>
The Turtle Island String Quartet has even greater credentials, since all four 
are versed in the freewheeling art; however, Greene and his colleagues claim 
such a delightfully eclectic repertoire that their program, announced with a 
dry wit by Greene, was a flawless blend of classical virtuosity, swinging good 
humor and passionate dedication. 
</P>
<P>
Opening with a touch of country style swing in "Hoedown," the group soon took 
up the everlasting subject of the blues in Jon Charles' riff-rife "Bluegreene." 
</P>
<P>
In two pieces originally written for a full-string ensemble, the quartet's 
harmony was rich enough to suggest a much larger group. The high point was 
reached with an adaptation of "Goodby Porkpie Hat," Charles Mingus' tribute to 
Lester Young. In the evening's only vocal, Jimbo Ross and violinist Margaret 
Wooten sang the lyrics; then Ross simultaneously scatted and played a solo, a 
la George Benson. 
</P>
<P>
The gifted cellist Melissa Hasin filled a dual part, adding her sound to the 
ensemble's but occasionally playing pizzicato in the manner of a walking jazz 
bass. Never was the absence of a regular rhythm section conspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Kusby's ingenious arrangement of "Doin' Things," a 60-year-old piece by jazz 
violinist Joe Venuti, found Jimbo Ross strumming his viola like a reincarnation 
of guitarist Eddie Lang. After winding up with a Doors medley, the quartet 
offered a tongue-in-cheek novelty, "Diary of a Fly," as an encore. 
</P>
<P>
The group worked contentedly without amplification in this intimate setting. 
After all the time its members have put in playing pop in the studios or rock 
in the clubs, it was obvious they were having the time of their lives, as was 
the audience.LEONARD FEATHER

MAISKY OPENS SOUTHLAND VISIT WITH LAGUNA RECITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neither the most style-conscious nor the most immaculate of cellists, Mischa 
Maisky, who returns to Southern California this week for appearances with the 
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra (beginning Wednesday), nevertheless brings a 
strong musical personality to his playing. 
</P>
<P>
Opening his week's visit here Sunday night with a recital for the Laguna Beach 
Chamber Music Society, Maisky asserted that personality boldly. Like his 
mentors, Mstislav Rostropovich and the late Gregor Piatigorsky, Maisky makes 
music that is a personal statement first of all. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the second half of Maisky's recital, in which he was assisted by 
pianist David Gross, proved the more engrossing portion of the performance in 
the unheated auditorium at Laguna Beach High School. Maisky and Gross seemed to 
relish all the challenges and facets in Schubert's "Arpeggione" Sonata and in 
the Sonata by Debussy, clearly distinguishing their disparate rhetorics. 
</P>
<P>
For once, the genuine lightness of mood and melancholy musical subtext of the 
"Arpeggione" were indicated without resort to grandstanding. The cellist and 
his solid pianistic partner gave every phrase its due, but overstated nothing. 
This reading therefore achieved great charm without great self-consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
The hardy but still crushable Debussy opus also benefited from such a 
clarifying approach. And the teamwork between the two players again proved 
tight and single-minded. 
</P>
<P>
Less involving and less satisfying, the pre-intermission performances emerged 
earthbound, if competent. Maisky's playing of Bach's Suite No. 3 for 
unaccompanied cello seemed to specialize in articulate statements not always 
connected to each other in thought, regular fragmenting of the longer line and 
contrasts sought for their own sake. 
</P>
<P>
And Brahms' familiar E-minor Sonata became more dutiful than passionate, the 
piano part in particular remaining in the emotional shadows.DANIEL CARIAGA

Hopes for a final, negotiated settlement in a 25-year-old Los Angeles Unified 
School District desegregation battle faded Monday when a federal judge put the 
case back on course toward a trial, possibly late this year. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima approved dismissal of the school 
district from the suit, leaving the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People and state education officials as the remaining combatants. The 
three parties had tried for seven months to reach an out-of-court agreement, 
but negotiations broke down several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
The latest development breathes new life into the bitter, long-running 
integration fight that began in Los Angeles Superior Court in 1963 and peaked 
with nearly three years of court-ordered cross-town busing from 1979 to 1981. 
Busing stopped after a voter-approved initiative -- Proposition 1 -- limited 
the ability of state courts to order mandatory busing. The case moved to 
federal courts in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory busing has remained a legal possibility. But civil rights lawyers 
have generally acknowledged that with minority students now making up more than 
80% of the student population, forced busing may no longer be an effective way 
to deal with segregation in the nation's second-largest school system. 
</P>
<P>
Recent efforts in the case have focused on devising special educational 
programs that would improve opportunities for students in low-achieving 
inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
In what appeared to be a breakthrough last June, Tashima granted a conditional 
dismissal of the case against the school district, but ordered the district, 
the state and the NAACP to try and work out their differences. 
</P>
<P>
NAACP and school district lawyers said Monday that a settlement, including an 
$84-million-a-year enhanced instructional program for dozens of inner-city 
schools, appeared possible until representatives of the state declared last 
month that they would not pay for any of the program. NAACP General Counsel 
Grover Hankins told Tashima that the state "pulled the rug out from under us." 
</P>
<P>
State lawyers, representing Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and the 
state Board of Education, said the NAACP and the school district were 
misrepresenting the situation. No agreement had been reached on funding or the 
adequacy of the proposed instructional improvements at the inner-city schools, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keep Talks Alive 
</P>
<P>
Hankins Monday urged Tashima to keep the school district in the case and to 
keep the negotiations alive. But the judge, citing school district and state 
arguments, noted that settlement now appears unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima then finalized his order dismissing the school district as a defendant 
in the case, an action that the NAACP had endorsed last year when it appeared a 
settlement was at hand. 
</P>
<P>
The action leaves the state as the only remaining defendant. The NAACP, 
representing the district's black students, has charged the state contributed 
to segregation over the years with a series of actions and inactions, such as 
approving the construction of new schools in racially segregated neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Tashima, expressing frustration at delays in the case, criticized the NAACP for 
not having its "act together." He said if the civil rights group does not 
quickly produce state-requested documents to support its case, he will consider 
a motion to dismiss the case against the state also. 
</P>
<P>
Hankins said he is "disappointed" with Tashima's ruling, but he insisted that 
the NAACP's case against the state is strong. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Laws 
</P>
<P>
One course of action previously discussed in the case by the NAACP would be to 
try to prove the Los Angeles system was segregated, in part, by state laws 
allowing the formation of largely white suburban school districts. For example, 
the largely white Palos Verdes Unified School District, in one of the most 
affluent areas of the state, was allowed to separate from the Los Angeles 
Unified district more than 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But Hankins declined to elaborate on his association's plans, saying the NAACP 
would have to assess the impact of Tashima's ruling over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Peter James, an attorney for the school district, said he was pleased that the 
district was dismissed from the case but disappointed that an opportunity 
appears to have been missed to reach agreement on a plan to improve education 
at inner-city schools.

<P>
California's retarded people have been good to Edward T. and Marcia Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Dawson receives a salary of more than $110,000 a year in his publicly 
funded business to house, treat and train the retarded. His wife is paid 
$60,000 more for her role in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
The couple possess $1.6 million in California real estate, including a home in 
Palos Verdes Estates and a condominium in San Francisco. Much of this 
accumulation of real estate has been made possible by a controversial 
lease-back arrangement between the Dawsons and the corporation they operate. 
</P>
<P>
While the couple have prospered, the state Department of Social Services has 
found that the quality of care provided to the retarded in their charge has 
been so poor that the Dawsons' 13-home operation was placed on probation last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Retarded clients in several of the Dawsons' group homes have suffered from 
serious neglect and mistreatment during the last few years, including physical 
and sexual abuse, according to state licensing officials. 
</P>
<P>
The terms of probation prohibit the Dawsons from opening any new facilities for 
18 months and require that they provide better supervision for clients in their 
group homes and in their training programs or face loss of the group home 
licenses, according to state attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dawsons continue to operate the programs, known as Social 
Vocational Services in Southern California and Developmental Services Assn. in 
the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
These two tax-exempt nonprofit companies -- with combined yearly budgets of 
$14.8 million -- raise questions about California's publicly funded system for 
caring for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Thomas Dawson is a slender, youthful-looking man of 41 with strawberry 
blond hair and wide green eyes. People tend to like him. Even estranged 
associates who are disappointed in the direction Dawson's business has taken 
seem to regard him fondly. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson tends to be non-confrontational. He acknowledges that there have been 
shortcomings in his programs -- even some serious ones -- but he maintains that 
most of them were in the past and have been corrected. He appears to genuinely 
believe, despite the accusations of his critics, that he is doing a superior 
job in caring for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson entered the business of caring for the retarded when he was a 
31-year-old graduate student in educational psychology at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
He founded Social Vocational Services as a nonprofit corporation in 1978 and 
became the president, treasurer and chief executive officer. Dawson's program 
basically involves providing care for severely retarded and autistic people in 
small group homes and developing training programs that theoretically attempt 
to integrate the residents into normal community life, relying extensively on a 
fleet of vans to take the clients to various locations, mostly outdoors, where 
they perform such tasks as distributing advertising leaflets, cleaning up 
litter and doing yardwork. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson receives $30 to $40 per client per day from the state for this 
out-of-home training program, which serves about 800 people. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the severity of the clients' disabilities and problems, Dawson 
also is paid $18,000 or $35,000 per client per year by the state for home care 
in his 13 group homes throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
The facilities house about six residents each. Most of the residents in these 
homes have been transferred from state hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
About the time Dawson was setting up Social Vocational Services, he met his 
future wife, who has a retarded son. Marcia Dawson was then working as a 
caseworker for the Harbor Regional Center, a private nonprofit agency with 
which the state Department of Developmental Services contracts to place clients 
in programs and homes for the retarded in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, 
where Dawson began his programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Service for My Clients' 
</P>
<P>
"His ideas," Marcia Dawson said of her husband, "were just what I was trying to 
find and develop as a service for my clients." 
</P>
<P>
Marcia Dawson subsequently went to work for Social Vocational Services, and she 
and Edward Dawson were married in 1984. Her retarded son lives in a Social 
Vocational Services home. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Dawson got his doctorate in educational psychology from UCLA in 1982, as 
his business grew. In 1984, he founded Developmental Services Assn. in Northern 
California. It was originally formed as a for-profit corporation but was 
subsequently converted to nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
Before opening Social Vocational Services and Developmental Services Assn., 
Dawson had dabbled modestly in real estate in Southern California. After going 
into the business of providing care for the retarded, Dawson made substantial 
investments in property up and down the state. 
</P>
<P>
Between June, 1984, and May, 1985, Edward and Marcia Dawson purchased seven 
homes in Los Angeles and San Mateo counties, a condominium in San Francisco and 
their home in Palos Verdes Estates, according to assessors' records. 
</P>
<P>
The seven houses are leased by the Dawsons to Social Vocational Services and 
Developmental Services Assn. for $1,300 to $1,700 per month and used as group 
homes for the retarded. The houses remain in the Dawsons' names as individuals 
and -- while public funds are used to pay for the maintenance and, in effect, 
the mortgages -- the equity building in the homes is the Dawsons' personal 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The condominium in San Francisco is leased from the Dawsons by Developmental 
Services Assn. for $1,400 per month. It is used, according to an accountant 
working for Dawson, as an office and a residence by the Dawsons and by a staff 
psychologist while they are on Developmental Services Assn. business in 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Such lease-back arrangements apparently are legal but frowned upon by many 
advocates for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear about things like that and you hope it isn't true," said Lore 
Radisch, who helped establish an Assn. for Retarded Citizens group home in 
Marin County in which her autistic daughter lives. 
</P>
<P>
Radisch, a member of the Assn. for Retarded Citizens' California governing 
board, said the organization's 10 homes in Marin County are legally owned by a 
nonprofit corporation, not by private individuals. 
</P>
<P>
She was also critical of the amount of Dawson's salary. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know that anyone (providing care for the retarded) was making this 
kind of money," she said. "To hear of this kind of thing just appalls me." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson contended that nonprofit corporations set up by parents of the retarded, 
such as networks of Assn. for Retarded Citizens homes, are fundamentally 
different from his operation because he has invested his own money in his firm. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson argued that he is entitled to his six-figure salary and pointed out 
that, because his companies ran in the red in 1987 he loaned the operation 
$78,000 of his own money and arranged a $200,000 bank loan guaranteed by the 
Dawsons' equity in the group homes. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to draw a salary," he said, "money has to come from someplace and 
somebody had to extend (it). . . . There's a level of exposure. I have assumed 
that level of exposure in order to keep the organization . . . afloat." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson's firms have begun paying back the $200,000 loan with 12% interest, and 
Raymond A. Hebrank, an accountant working for Dawson, said the operations 
should soon be in the black and have a bright financial future. 
</P>
<P>
Hebrank also acknowledged that in the unlikely event that the companies were to 
go under, it would be up to Dawson to decide which debts to pay. In other 
words, with a $14.8-million annual budget, Dawson would be in a position to pay 
back his loans to himself before his companies went into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
Loan arrangements between Dawson and his companies have not been a one-way 
street. 
</P>
<P>
Hebrank acknowledged that in 1986, Dawson borrowed $52,900 from Social 
Vocational Services. In addition, Dawson said he borrowed $9,500 from 
Developmental Services Assn. in 1987 to pay property taxes on his personal real 
estate. Hebrank said both loans have been repaid with 12% interest. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dawson said he pays $4.65 to $6.93 an hour to his direct-care 
workers in the homes dealing with retarded and autistic residents, many of whom 
have severe behavior problems and are sometimes violent. 
</P>
<P>
There are no state regulations controlling how much operators of homes for the 
retarded may pay themselves, how much they must pay staff members or even how 
the public money is to be spent. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department (of Developmental Services) doesn't care and neither do we . . 
. as long as the care to the clients is still adequate," said Gail P. Sass, 
associate director of the Harbor Regional Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are more economical and can run a facility more economically than 
others," she continued. "If you can buy food in bulk and run your facility at 
less cost, more power to you." 
</P>
<P>
Gary D. Macomber, director of the state Department of Developmental Services, 
takes a similar view. 
</P>
<P>
"My primary concern is that clients are getting the quality service that we are 
paying for," he said. "If they (home operators) can be real creative in how 
they are operating and effect some other economies that are not detrimental to 
client care, then they may be able to do that. . . . (But) if the quality of 
care is not what we're contracting for, it's never OK." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson continues to operate even though the quality of the services provided by 
Social Vocational Services and Developmental Services Assn. has been under 
frequent and severe criticism by state officials and others over the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Before a settlement resulting in probation for Dawson's group home operations, 
Developmental Services Assn. and Social Vocational Services faced formal 
accusations by the state Department of Social Services seeking revocation of 
the licenses of six group homes for the retarded in Los Angeles, Anaheim and 
San Mateo County. 
</P>
<P>
An accusation dated Sept. 12, seeking revocation of the four Developmental 
Services Assn. group home licenses in San Mateo County, contended that a 
mentally retarded resident was sexually molested in January, 1987, by a staff 
member on parole for armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
"An allegation doesn't mean it's true," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the suspect in the alleged molestation was on parole from 
Illinois for armed robbery and that Developmental Services Assn. had not sent 
in his fingerprints to the state for a background check required by law. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence Lost 
</P>
<P>
Dawson said, however, that Developmental Services Assn. had checked the 
employee's California job references for the previous 18 months and was 
satisfied with the results. 
</P>
<P>
Social Service attorneys also contend that evidence in the molestation case was 
lost when Developmental Services Assn. staff members in San Mateo delayed 
reporting the incident to the police. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson said that a Social Vocational Services administrator in Los Angeles had 
instructed a Developmental Services Assn. staff member by phone to gather 
additional information before making a police report because it did not appear 
clear "whether that was a reportable incident." 
</P>
<P>
He said contradictory statements had been made by the alleged victim of the 
molestation. 
</P>
<P>
State accusations also listed a raft of other charges against Developmental 
Services Assn. and Social Vocational Services homes, including a complaint that 
in April, 1986, "a client was beaten, placed in a chokehold until he passed 
out, bound at the hands and ankles with a rope and left out in the garage for 
several hours." 
</P>
<P>
At the same home later that year, a staff member allegedly broke the nose and 
bruised the torso of a client who was not given medical treatment for two days, 
according to the accusation. 
</P>
<P>
The document charges that staff members in two of the homes, through "lack of 
training and/or insufficient numbers, were unable to control these (violent) 
clients." Marcia Dawson acknowledged that there were about "five incidents of a 
serious nature" in the Developmental Services Assn. homes in San Mateo but said 
such things caused a "shock within the agency." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Dawson argued that all the accusations are "not necessarily true" and 
denied that a "pattern" of client mistreatment exists in the homes. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact," he said, "that there are 72 people with behavior problems (in 
Social Vocational Services and Developmental Services Assn. homes), there will 
be problems in the care of these people. But I believe we are doing everything 
we can to prevent any problems." 
</P>
<P>
A state accusation seeking revocation of a Social Vocational Services home in 
Lawndale listed case after case of alleged neglect from 1982 to 1986. One of 
them: "On numerous occasions (from) . . . October, 1982, to November, 1985, 
Client No. 2 was allowed to wander away from the facility. On one occasion, the 
child sustained minor injuries when he was struck by a car. On another 
occasion, the child was picked up by the (California) Highway Patrol while he 
was roller skating on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it was on the freeway," said Marcia Dawson, "I think it might 
have been on an on-ramp." 
</P>
<P>
"We are not allowed to lock the doors," said Edward Dawson. "We're supposed to 
supervise the children, (but) this particular child was very clever, and when a 
staff member was out of sight for a moment, he would dash out the door. They 
would maybe notice five seconds after he was gone and they would run out after 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson voluntarily closed the Lawndale facility. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to problems with Department of Social Services officials, Dawson 
has run into trouble with state health department inspectors, who are 
responsible for inspecting homes for retarded patients who need medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Health inspectors accused Social Vocational Services of negligence in the 1985 
rape and impregnation by a staff member of a profoundly retarded resident in a 
home in Mt. Washington. The young woman was about six months pregnant before 
her condition was diagnosed in the spring of 1986, according to a state 
inspection report. 
</P>
<P>
The case has similarities to the later San Mateo case involving the 
Developmental Services Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, inspectors accused Social Vocational Services of failure to obtain 
a required fingerprint clearance for the night attendant at the home, who 
police say had a criminal record. The staff member was subsequently convicted 
of rape and sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Procedures Tightened 
</P>
<P>
Dawson contended that the fingerprint clearance for the rapist had been 
requested as required and that, at any rate, he has since tightened up the 
fingerprint checking process. 
</P>
<P>
Dawson has been repeatedly cited in the last few years for failure to seek 
criminal background fingerprint checks of his staff members, as required by 
state regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In August the state Department of Social Services licensing office in Santa Ana 
accused Social Vocational Services of trying to circumvent the fingerprint 
checking process "in order to avoid the close scrutiny of our (licensing 
inspector)," according to an Aug. 8 intradepartmental memo. 
</P>
<P>
In a March 10 Social Vocational Services internal memo obtained by state 
officials, Dawson's employees were directed to avoid sending fingerprints to an 
Orange County licensing inspector who had challenged the corporation on the 
employment of several people with criminal records. 
</P>
<P>
"We are having a great deal of trouble with Orange County licensing regarding 
the (training program) fingerprint cards," said the memo. "There have been 11 
so far that (license inspector) Ronalee Frost has called us on because of 
criminal convictions. . . . Please see that no cards are submitted to Ronalee 
Frost or Orange County Licensing as of this date." 
</P>
<P>
Social Vocational Services rescinded the directive in a May 26 memo and on June 
7, Marcia Dawson wrote to Frost in Santa Ana to say the whole thing was a 
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told by our former group home program administrator that you did not 
like so many fingerprints going through your office," wrote Marcia Dawson, "The 
intention was not, I believe, on any person's part to circumvent the 
fingerprint clearance process." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Dawson reiterated that denial and explained that Social Vocational 
Services had been trying to process large numbers of prints belonging to 
training program employees. 
</P>
<P>
He said Social Vocational Services was also seeking clearance to hire "people 
that had minor criminal records." 
</P>
<P>
Such potential employees, he said, might have committed "petty theft . . . five 
years before." 
</P>
<P>
"Licensing (officials in Orange County) didn't want to process that number of 
prints," said Dawson, "and they had problems with that number of appeals 
(regarding applicants with criminal convictions)." 
</P>
<P>
Social Vocational Services also has run into trouble in Orange County over 
quality of care in its homes for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
In August, for example, it was cited for being unable to control a client in 
its Yorba Linda home who "poses a serious health problem because she 
continuously flicks urine" on other residents, "even at the dinner table." 
</P>
<P>
The inspection report says of Social Vocational Services: 
</P>
<P>
"Licensee has not demonstrated the ability to hire, train or maintain qualified 
staff or to supervise facility operations. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we do have staff that is qualified to work with the clients," Dawson 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1987, a Social Vocational Services home in the city of Orange was 
cited with nine pages of deficiencies, including dirty walls, a rotting floor 
molding, a dirty refrigerator, missing screens, dirty carpeting throughout the 
facility and feces on a chair and in a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
"If that was the case," said Dawson, "it's no longer the case." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson also has run into controversy in Orange County and elsewhere over his 
out-of-home training program for the retarded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Community Work Adjustment Program, as it is called, has been 
certified by the Tucson-based Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation 
Facilities, it has been severely criticized elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supervised Employment 
</P>
<P>
Some of the components of Dawson's program -- such as those that provide jobs 
for clients who are considered relatively "high functioning" -- have been 
praised. In these instances, clients are taken to jobs at fast-food restaurants 
or automobile dealerships where they are supervised by Dawson staff members. 
</P>
<P>
But Dawson's programs for the severely retarded, some of whom have serious 
behavior problems, have come under heavy fire. 
</P>
<P>
In these programs, clients -- who live in Dawson's homes and elsewhere -- are 
picked up each morning in vans and taken to various locations for training. 
</P>
<P>
The clients are driven six at a time to such places as parks where they pick up 
litter, to residential neighborhoods to distribute flyers, to homes to do 
yardwork, to stores to learn to make purchases and to intersections to learn to 
cross streets. Theoretically, the program integrates clients into the 
community, rather than segregating them in training centers or workshops with 
other retarded people, as is done in more traditional programs. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, say critics, the clients in Dawson's van programs frequently spend 
much of their time simply being driven around in the care of poorly trained 
staff members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rated 'Inadequate' 
</P>
<P>
For example, a Social Vocational Services van program in Fullerton was rated 
"inadequate, poor," last April in an official confidential report done by a 
private consultant for the Orange County Developmental Disabilities Center. 
</P>
<P>
"(The) majority of program time is spent on van or in parks," says the report, 
a copy of which was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The program, says the report, "utilizes isolated community settings; no 
interaction with non-handicapped were observed." 
</P>
<P>
The report quotes a staff member as ordering a client: "Don't go over there. 
There are people over there." 
</P>
<P>
Staff turnover, says the report, is 133% per year and adds, "Staff could not 
state program goals." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson contended that the consultant who did the evaluation in 1988 changed the 
criteria from the year before, when the program was found satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that we understand . . . the evaluation instrument that was used," he 
said, "we'll change our program." The Times observed similar conditions last 
year during two days spent with clients in Social Vocational Services van 
programs in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
Clients from a Social Vocational Services home in Mt. Washington were driven to 
an intersection where staff members hurriedly walked them, one and two at a 
time, across the street, supposedly to show them how to safely cross with the 
light. On one occasion, a staff member led two clients across the street 
directly against the "Don't Walk" light as a car stopped at a green light to 
allow them to pass. 
</P>
<P>
In a South Bay area program, a Social Vocational Services staff member tried to 
show one or two clients at a time how to distribute advertising flyers to 
doorsteps, while the remaining four or five sat in the van waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the clients were severely impaired and some had to be watched 
constantly to prevent them from abusing themselves or from wandering away. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Faulkner, a community college student making $6.29 an hour, was in charge 
of the van in the South Bay, accompanied by an assistant being paid $4.25 per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of useless driving around," said Faulkner, who later resigned. 
"When it rains, we have nothing to do. We usually stay in the van all day 
driving around." 
</P>
<P>
State health inspectors in San Gabriel made a similar observation about Social 
Vocational Services clients in a van program. 
</P>
<P>
"On a particularly rainy day that may have been the case," acknowledged Dawson, 
"but we're very sensitive about the amount of time the clients are spending in 
the van, and we're increasing the amount of work time and the amount of time 
integrated in the community."

</P>
<P>

<P>
Talking tough but also urging cooperation, Gov. George Deukmejian invited 
legislators in his annual State of the State address on Monday to join him in 
creating new proposals to unclog California's highways and to reform the 
state's budget process. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding highway tie-ups, Deukmejian said, "It is time to seriously consider 
restricting commercial truck traffic on our freeways during peak hours in urban 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
On the state budget, the Republican governor questioned "the continued 
usefulness" of a spending limit that voters amended into the California 
Constitution 10 years ago. He suggested the limit may no longer be workable 
because of subsequent voter actions, such as the approval last November of 
Proposition 98 guaranteeing public schools roughly 40% of the state's general 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian proposed one "long overdue" change in California's political system: 
He advocated the election of the governor and the lieutenant governor as a 
"ticket," similar to the way the President and vice president are elected. The 
governor and lieutenant governor now run separately, and in recent years the 
result often has been that the victors on Election Day are from different 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian did not mention it in his State of the State address, but if the 
lieutenant governor last year had been a Republican instead of a Democrat, the 
governor would have felt free to consider vice presidential overtures from 
George Bush. As it was, Deukmejian would have had to turn the governor's office 
over to Democrat Leo T. McCarthy had he been elected vice president. 
</P>
<P>
On another political matter, Deukmejian said he now is willing to join the 
chorus of legislators advocating an earlier presidential primary in order to 
restore California's former clout in the nominating process. He also asked the 
lawmakers to join him in urging Washington to set a uniform poll closing time 
for the next presidential election, so that television networks will be unable 
to project the winner before Californians finish voting. 
</P>
<P>
As governors traditionally have, Deukmejian delivered the State of the State 
address -- his seventh -- from the dais of the ornate, 19th-Century-style 
Assembly chamber. Jammed into the chamber for what always is one of the 
Capitol's biggest events of the year were the legislators, other statewide 
officeholders, top Administration officials and invited guests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Third Term 
</P>
<P>
This was the first time Deukmejian has faced the Democratic-controlled 
Legislature as a political lame duck. The governor announced last Thursday that 
he will not run for a third term, pledging during his final two years in office 
to "personally reach out" to legislative leaders in hopes of developing some 
bipartisan solutions to pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
Reiterating his observation about this new "window of opportunity" for 
bipartisanship, Deukmejian said somewhat humorously: "And why not? With peace 
breaking out all over the world -- with President Reagan talking to (Soviet 
President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev, with the U.S. talking to (PLO Chairman Yasser) 
Arafat, and with Speaker Willie Brown talking to the (Democratic rebel) 'Gang 
of Five' -- surely we ought to be able to work together peacefully and 
productively." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "I thought of suggesting a second honeymoon. But I can't seem to 
recall the first." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's appeal for peaceful and productive cooperation drew the biggest 
applause of his speech. He was interrupted six times in all. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of his words were conciliatory. For example, the governor warned the 
legislators that if they do not provide him with sufficient money in the next 
state budget to fund a 3% "rainy day" reserve, he will veto enough spending 
programs to acquire the money himself. Democrats already have indicated they 
will oppose setting aside such a reserve at a time when the governor is 
expected to be trying to cut many social programs. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian, anticipating criticisms of the new budget proposal he will send to 
the Legislature today, admonished the lawmakers that "rather than shout at each 
other or make intemperate remarks to the media, we (should) sit down together 
over the next five months to develop a budget plan that is balanced, fair and 
compassionate to all Californians." 
</P>
<P>
On transportation, an increasingly controversial issue as freeways become more 
clogged and highway construction wanes for lack of funds, Deukmejian sounded a 
little bit at times like his predecessor, Democrat Edmund G. Brown, Jr., an 
advocate of alternative solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to unlock gridlock in our state with a two-track approach: build more 
roads where needed and make better use of the transportation system we already 
have," the governor said. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not underestimate the impact that ride sharing, mass transit and 
better traffic management can have on congestion. If we can increase the 
average number of riders per vehicle from 1.2 to 1.4, congestion would 
virtually disappear without adding a single additional mile of pavement to our 
system." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he has offered state workers "financial incentives" to 
ride-share and has asked major businesses to do the same for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
But acknowledging that "we must also finance and build more highways," the 
governor disclosed that he soon will invite legislative leaders and 
representatives of local governments, businesses and organized labor to meet 
with him "to develop a funding plan" to be submitted to voters in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian provided few details of what he has in mind, however. Nor did he on 
most of the issues he touched on in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he will invite legislative leaders "to sit down" with him "to 
thoroughly review the state budget process." He proposed placing on the table 
for negotiation "all mandated entitlements, automatic cost-of-living 
adjustments in spending programs, as well a complete re-examination" of the 
spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats never have really liked the spending limit, but they historically 
have been protective of "entitlement" programs for welfare families, the aged, 
blind and disabled and Medi-Cal recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian lamented that budgeting has become so restricted because of 
"statutes, constitutional amendments, court orders and other legal 
requirements" that the governor now has effective control over only 8% of state 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding education, Deukmejian said he will propose that $110 million of the 
new Proposition 98 money be spent for teaching basic subjects and reducing 
class size. He also called for adoption of a comprehensive drug education 
program statewide, adding: "Saying 'no' to drugs must be part of the basic 
learning curriculum of every child beginning in grade school." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working Prisoners 
</P>
<P>
As for people convicted of drug crimes or any other felonies, Deukmejian said, 
"It is time that the criminals themselves worked and paid for their own 
upkeep." He reiterated his longstanding conviction that inmates should be 
allowed to manufacture goods that can be sold outside the prisons. 
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that labor unions have opposed this concept on grounds that 
it "would take jobs away from law-abiding Californians." But he dismissed this 
argument, saying that even if every inmate worked, they would make up just 0.5% 
of the total state work force. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he will try to place a state constitutional amendment on the 
1990 ballot "to put into place a system where all able-bodied inmates are 
required to work and are charged for their room and board." 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects, Deukmejian also: 
</P>
<P>
* Called for a complete examination of the state's 13 separate school dropout 
prevention programs, now costing $805 million a year. He said a new strategy 
should be developed because last year "an estimated 33% of high school students 
dropped out anyway." 
</P>
<P>
* Said a top priority of his Administration this year will be to develop a 
comprehensive plan for garbage disposal. "We're running out of places to bury 
it or burn it," he said, adding that he wants to work toward the goals of waste 
reduction and greater recycling. 
</P>
<P>
* Noted that he will open a new California trade and investment office in 
Mexico City next month, and announced intentions to establish new branches to 
the state's Tokyo and London offices somewhere in Asia and Europe. He did not 
say precisely where. 
</P>
<P>
* Proposed increasing the prison sentence for large-scale importation of heroin 
or cocaine to a minimum of 25 years without possibility of parole. He also 
advocated the death penalty for first-degree murder committed during a 
drug-related crime. 
</P>
<P>
* Said he "would welcome the opportunity" to work with the Legislature in 
developing new political reforms to "restore the public's confidence in the 
integrity of the legislative process." The FBI currently is investigating 
alleged political corruption in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Favorable Reactions 
</P>
<P>
The governor's speech drew generally good reviews from legislative leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said "it clearly was a speech 
of a statesman who's on his way out." 
</P>
<P>
This means, Brown said, that "the governor is literally free of any need to 
consider political restraints and maybe we'll see great leadership." But Brown 
added that he wished that Deukmejian had advocated raising the gasoline tax to 
pump more money into the transportation building fund. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who frequently has 
feuded with Deukmejian, said the governor "was as friendly as could be. I'm not 
going to rehash past history. I'm going to accept his outreach." 
</P>
<P>
Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra praised Deukmejian for 
agreeing to an earlier presidential primary. And he called the proposal to 
require prisoners to work "a terrific idea."

PARIS' CHAMPS-ELYSEES; 
</P>
<P>
ONCE-CHIC AVENUE GOES DEMOCRATIC

<P>
To some, the recent developments along the broad Avenue des Champs-Elysees are 
nothing less than a "massacre" of one of the world's great streets -- a 
desecration of the French triumphal path that once bore the ashes of Napoleon 
Bonaparte and the coffin of Victor Hugo. 
</P>
<P>
"The degradation of the Champs-Elysees reflects the degradation of society in 
general," argues Maurice Casanova, owner of Fouquet's, the last remaining 
classic belle epoque-style restaurant left on the avenue. To Casanova, his 
restaurant is a proud battleship holding out against an armada of swift, modern 
destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
Others have a more evolutionary view of the 1.1-mile stretch between the Arc de 
Triomphe and the Place de la Concorde that the French proudly call the "most 
beautiful avenue in the world." The Champs-Elysees, this side contends, has 
been "democratized" to make room for even more people to share its glory. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dry-Eyed Advertising Man 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to cry any tears over the coming of fast-food restaurants to the 
Champs-Elysees," said Claude Marcus, president of Publicis, an international 
advertising firm based on the avenue. "To me, this is an aspect of 
modernization and the democratization of the city center that you see in all 
the big cities of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
From there, the debate breaks down into the populist vs. elitist, republican 
vs. monarchist, ready-to-wear vs. high-fashion kind of exchange that has been 
at the center of history here since the French Revolution 200 years ago this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Still, everyone agrees on one thing: The Champs-Elysees has undergone a 
metamorphosis in recent years. It is no longer the fashionable center of town. 
On the other hand, in terms of numbers of visitors and volume of sales in its 
stores and eateries, it is more popular than ever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Astrology Centers 
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 years, most of the haute couture shops, perfumeries and fancy 
restaurants that once lined the path have moved away, many to the nearby Avenue 
Montaigne and Rue du Faubourg-St. Honore. In their place are jeans and 
sweat-shirt emporiums, compact disc stores, one-hour photo shops and 
computerized astrology centers, all bouncing to the blaring beat of 
rock-infused sound systems. 
</P>
<P>
The grand hotels of the past have all been gutted to make room for shopping 
malls and video-game parlors. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, fast-food restaurants with names like Pop Inn, Free Time and, 
yes, McDonald's and Burger King now battle for sidewalk space with double-deck 
pizza parlors. 
</P>
<P>
"You no longer see the elegant set strolling on the Champs-Elysees," said 
Police Commissioner Jean-Louis Camus, until recently the man in charge of 
Paris' most famous street. "Today is the reign of the cornet de frites -- 
French fries in a cup. The elegant promenaders have been chased away." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the broad sidewalks and tree-lined curbs of the avenue have become 
havens for peddlers who hawk giant balloons and plastic mechanical birds that 
dart annoyingly through the air; an increasing number of homeless; performers 
who amuse the crowds outside movie theaters by swallowing razor blades, and 
phalanxes of special French police units, the swaggering Compagnie Republicaine 
de Securite, in their navy blue flight jackets. 
</P>
<P>
The police are there to keep the peace among the avenue's daily volume of 
250,000 people, many of them unemployed youths who come into town on the 
inexpensive suburban train system. Indeed, those in the elitist camp often mark 
the beginning of the Champs-Elysees' transformation with the opening in 1970 of 
the Reseau Express Regional train station underneath the Arc de Triomphe, which 
made the center of Paris accessible to those from the mainly working-class 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
The result of all this is that the Champs-Elysees -- the avenue that Marcel 
Bleustein-Blanchet, creator of Le Drugstore, calls the "great beating heart of 
the city, showcase of its riches, its glories and its passions" -- is no longer 
chic. 
</P>
<P>
For the stylish French professional class, the Champs-Elysees has all the 
allure of a bottle of ketchup. In tribute to this attitude, the annual French 
yuppie guidebook, "BC BG: Le Bon Chic Bon Genre," put it first on the list of 
"places to avoid." 
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean that the Champs-Elysees has suddenly become 
overwhelmingly ugly or deadly dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, practically nothing done to the avenue, first developed as a royal 
carriage path in the early 17th Century by Marie de Medici, wife of King Henry 
IV, makes much of a dent in its natural grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
From its base in the Place de la Concorde, where the renowned obelisk from the 
Temple of Luxor was installed in 1836, the avenue rises along the gentle grade 
of Chaillot Hill to the magnificent, 162-foot-high Arc de Triomphe, 
commissioned by Napoleon in 1806 to glorify his military victories. 
</P>
<P>
The great width of the Champs-Elysees -- more than 200 feet for its entire 
course -- and Paris' 24-meter (79-foot) limitation on building height gives it 
an ideal scale for the celebration of human triumph and military conquest. 
American troops paraded here at the end of World War I and World War II. As 
commander of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers, Europe (SHAPE) after the 
second war, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower kept his residence and office in the old 
Hotel Astoria at No. 133. 
</P>
<P>
And the avenue remains a prestige address for any business, big or small. 
McDonald's reportedly spent $6 million to win its spot on the sunny side of the 
Champs (buildings on the street's northeast flank garner 20% more rent because 
of the increased exposure to light). Office rent can reach an annual rate in 
excess of $450 per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
The famed Tour de France bicycle race ends here every summer, concluding with 
several laps up and down the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Champs-Elysees is minor league compared to the horrific 
urban crime rates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime on the Champs-Elysees is mainly the kind of minor delinquency and petty 
theft you find in congested public places -- purse snatching and picking 
pockets," said Jean-Claude Guardiola, police chief of the 8th arrondissement, 
which contains the avenue as well as the French presidential palace and the 
U.S. and British embassies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, outrage over the trends along the Champs-Elysees has been bubbling for 
decades. In 1933, some Parisians complained that the street was going to the 
dogs when its first ready-to-wear clothing store, Prisunic, opened for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
In 1958, it was Bleustein-Blanchet's turn to spark a controversy when he opened 
Le Drugstore, the American-inspired combination pharmacy, all-hours restaurant 
and gift store that now has branches at both ends of the avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The main objection to Le Drugstore was the name, which many French officials 
found "too American." 
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister of the time, Michel Debre, proposed an alternate name, 
Bazaar," remembered Claude Marcus, a business associate of Bleustein-Blanchet. 
"A member of the Academie Francaise proposed the name Pan. Monsieur 
Bleustein-Blanchet said that one word was Turkish and the other Greek, and an 
American name seemed just as good to him." 
</P>
<P>
So it was Le Drugstore, and when it opened the first day, 5,000 people waited 
outside to get in. Indeed, looking back, this may have been a turning point in 
popularization of the Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
Steadily, the upscale boutiques gave way to more affordable shops and chains. 
Fashion leaders like Hermes and Lanvin and Vuitton moved out, while dozens of 
movie theaters and automobile display rooms were added to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"The Champs-Elysees," French President Charles de Gaulle commented 
sarcastically in the early 1960s, "is the most beautiful avenue in the world if 
you disregard the buildings that line it." 
</P>
<P>
Today, an estimated 60% to 80% of the buildings along the avenue are owned by 
foreigners, including oil-rich Arabs from the Persian Gulf and Japanese. The 
most recent shock to the system came this summer when Casanova, owner of the 
first-class restaurant Fouquet's, learned that the absentee Kuwaiti landlords 
of the Fouquet's building planned to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by dozens of celebrities who still frequent the restaurant, which remains 
the traditional location for the launching of any new film in town, Casanova 
appealed to French Culture Minister Jack Lang to declare the site a national 
monument. Any restaurant where James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Marilyn Monroe and 
Eleanor Roosevelt all dined at one time or another, he argued, should not be 
torn down. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in November, Casanova got his wish. Fouquet's was identified as a 
piece of French heritage to be protected, like the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower, 
in perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have done my duty," Casanova remarked proudly the other day in the rich 
wood-paneled, leather-cushioned Escadrille Bar of his restaurant. "If I never 
do anything else in my life, at least I know that no one will ever touch 
Fouquet's." 
</P>
<P>
About the rest of the famous avenue, Casanova is not so certain, however. He 
has helped sponsor a committee to protect the street against further 
intrusions. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not too late," he said, looking skeptical as the hordes of pedestrians, 
some carrying paper cups and cornet de frites, walked past. "It is true that we 
have the fast-food shops. But at least we do not yet have the sex shops on the 
Champs-Elysees. There is time to save what can be saved." 
</P>
<P>
The name, Champs-Elysees -- in English, Elysian Fields -- comes from the Greek 
name for the place at the end of the Earth, "the land of perfect happiness," 
that was reserved for dead warriors and others favored by the gods. The area 
was first listed under that name on a map published in 1697. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, De Medici ordered the land planted and developed as an 
agreeable carriage trail for the nobility. Not everyone, however, shared her 
enthusiasm for the place. 
</P>
<P>
The Marquis de Villette, a friend of the great French writer Voltaire, later 
described the Champs-Elysees as a "zone either torrid or glacial, a field of 
mud or dust, a terrain so rugged and uneven that even the strongest coaches are 
broken and the most robust horses exhausted. It is enough to annihilate the 
unfortunate walker who risks his life in the swamps if he nourishes the idea of 
a walk in the woods." 
</P>
<P>
Under Louis XV, the trail was improved slightly so that his mistress, the 
Marquise de Pompadour, could make her way to his palace in Versailles. 
</P>
<P>
In 1807, Napoleon Bonaparte staged a feast for 10,000 men at shaded tables 
arranged along the Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not until the mid-19th Century, under Emperor Napoleon III, that the 
avenue finally approached its full glory. The great Paris planner of the time, 
Baron George Eugene Haussmann, featured the street as a central fixture of his 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
During Haussmann's era, the great mansions alongside the road, the private 
hotels particuliers, began to appear. Only two remain today at the foot of the 
avenue, including the palace of the Marquise de la Paiva that houses the 
private Travelers Club, where members can still dine on a bench atop the 
Marquise's gold-plated bath. 
</P>
<P>
As the avenue emerged as a banking and business center at the turn of the 20th 
Century, the hotels particuliers were replaced by big institutional structures. 
When Citibank of New York decided to build its Paris headquarters on the 
avenue, it had the mansion that was sitting on the land rebuilt, brick by 
brick, in a Paris park, where it still serves as a center for writers. 
</P>
<P>
The New York bank announced the opening of its splendid new Art Deco building 
in 1931 as part of what it saw as a historic shift west, reflecting a very 
American, almost mystical concept rooted in the frontier experience. 
</P>
<P>
". . . Inside cities, business centers migrate periodically," the bank asserted 
in a brochure produced for the occasion. "Style imposes its pressures and 
entire quarters of the city, once fashionable, see themselves abandoned without 
apparent reason." 
</P>
<P>
The American bank even provided a little map to show how the fashionable 
neighborhoods of Paris have shifted steadily west since the 15th Century, when 
business and life centered on the Ile de la Cite in the Seine; to the 17th 
Century, dominated by the Place des Vosges; to the 18th-Century Rue 
Quincampoix; to the 19th-Century Palais Royale, Opera and Madeleine, and, 
finally, to the Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
"The heart of Paris has moved," the bank pronounced, smugly confident of its 
new site. Today, the main office of Citibank is located west of Paris in the 
high-rise suburb of La Defense. And the old bank building on the Champs-Elysees 
has been divided into a discount department store and a giant, British-owned 
record shop.

REPORT FAULTS COMMANDERS OF MARINE WHO DIED IN DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD B. TAYLOR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Poor planning" and a "total breakdown" in the chain of command were to blame 
in the death of Marine Lance Cpl. Jason J. Rother, 19, during desert training 
exercises at Twentynine Palms last summer, according a report released Monday 
by Marine Corps headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The conduct of Rother's commanders "contradicts every principle of concerned 
leadership on which we (Marines) have traditionally prided ourselves," Marine 
Corps Commandant Gen. Al Gray said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Gray said that the battalion commander and executive officers should be held 
accountable for the tragedy. Gray had ordered the second, more comprehensive 
investigation of Rother's disappearance after the man's parents complained to 
the media and congressional leaders last fall that not enough had been done to 
find their son. 
</P>
<P>
An initial investigation by the battalion commander, Lt. Col. E. J. Robeson IV, 
led to court-martial charges being filed against Rother's immediate superiors. 
</P>
<P>
Left behind last August when his unit pulled out after three days and nights of 
live-fire combat training at the 932-square-mile Marine Corps Air Ground Combat 
Center in the high desert, Rother wasn't reported missing for nearly 48 hours. 
His body was found Dec. 4 during a training exercise by a San Bernardino County 
sheriff's search and rescue unit. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying only three 1-quart canteens of water, the young Marine had managed to 
hike 17 miles in 110-degree daytime temperatures before he collapsed and died a 
mile from a busy highway, according to desert survival experts from nearby 
Joshua Tree National Monument who helped locate the body. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Robeson relieved Rother's company commander and platoon leader of 
their commands. In addition, he ordered that the two sergeants and a lieutenant 
who had dealt directly with Rother be tried for dereliction of duty and other 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Gray ordered a review of the roles played by Robeson and his 
executive officer, Maj. Tony L. Holm, according to Marine spokesman Lt. Col. 
Fred Peck. Gray's statement said, "Based upon additional recommendations made 
by the investigating officer . . . the commanding general of the 2nd Marine 
Division has been directed to . . . take appropriate action with respect to the 
battalion commander and the battalion executive officer of Rother's unit." 
</P>
<P>
Rother's death "was not an accident," Gray stated in the release. "His death 
didn't just happen. . . . It was the certain and foreseeable result of an 
attitude which I intend to erase from our corps." 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 30, the final night of the rigorous 72-hour combat exercise, Rother's 
battalion was ordered to make a motorized night march through a mountain pass 
and across the remote desert. Rother was posted at a checkpoint, one of several 
road guides directing traffic in the wilderness. When the guides were picked up 
before dawn, Rother was somehow left behind. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators "concluded that poor planning and direction in the placement and 
recovery" of the road guides "caused the failure to pick him up." Investigators 
termed the failure to report Rother missing a "total breakdown" in the chain of 
personnel accountability. 
</P>
<P>
Rother was assigned to a squad under the command of Platoon Sgt. Christopher 
Clyde. Clyde's court-martial is scheduled to start today. He and Squad Sgt. 
Thomas Turnell -- whose court-martial is scheduled for Jan. 24 -- are accused 
of being derelict in their duties for not keeping track of Rother. They also 
face charges of going on unauthorized leave right after the exercise ended, 
according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Allen V. Lawson, who placed Rother at the checkpoint, has been charged with 
dereliction of duty for failing to post the guides in pairs, as ordered, and 
for failing to account for Rother's whereabouts and welfare. Lawson is 
currently subject to a pretrial investigation, officials said.

MAN ADMITS ROLE IN PLOT TO CONCEAL ELECTION DONATIONS

Michael B. Altman, a defendant in an election law violation case involving 
pro-Israel activist Michael R. Goland, pleaded guilty in federal court Monday 
to a misdemeanor count of aiding Goland in making illegal campaign donations. 
</P>
<P>
Altman's sentencing was set for March 27 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, 
one month after the scheduled start of the Goland trial. Assistant U.S. Atty. 
George Newhouse Jr. told Judge Ronald S. W. Lew that Altman had agreed to 
cooperate with the government and testify at Goland's trial. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence Altman could receive would be a year in jail and a 
$360,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Altman, 42, a Sherman Oaks insurance broker, said under questioning by Lew that 
he was given money by Goland to contribute to an advertising campaign on behalf 
of an American Independent Party candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1986. The aim 
was to siphon votes away from Republican candidate Ed Zschau, thus improving 
the reelection chances of the Democratic incumbent, Alan Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston was outspokenly pro-Israel in the campaign. Zschau was more ambivalent 
on Middle Eastern questions. 
</P>
<P>
By laundering the money for Goland, Altman agreed he had involved himself in a 
violation of election laws that require that a person giving money to a 
candidate be identified as the donor. 
</P>
<P>
Goland and two other associates have pleaded not guilty to four felony counts 
in the same case. 
</P>
<P>
Newhouse told the judge that Altman, like Goland, was a member of a group named 
the Young American Political Action Committee that backed candidates deemed to 
be supportive of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1986, Newhouse said, Goland gave Altman $100,000 from a stock 
account to use for an unspecified purpose, and later told him to give $90,000 
of it to a firm known as Greenstripe Media to organize the advertising campaign 
for American Independent candidate Edward B. Vallen. Goland's construction 
firm, Balboa, also wrote a $30,000 check for the advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Later, 55 smaller donors, including Altman, were recruited to contribute to the 
advertising campaign as a cover, Newhouse said. The advertising firm gave these 
contributions to Altman after the election. He gave the money to Goland, who 
reimbursed the smaller donors. 
</P>
<P>
Altman told Judge Lew he agreed with this summary of the case. He said he had 
decided to plead guilty because he had done what he was charged with doing, and 
wanted to tell the truth at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
In answer to a reporter's question, Altman said that Cranston had at one point 
in the summer of 1986 addressed a luncheon meeting of the Young American 
Political Action Committee, but that the senator had known nothing about the 
contributions to Vallen. 
</P>
<P>
Altman's attorney, Harland Braun, said his client did not realize he was 
breaking the law when he laundered the money. 
</P>
<P>
"My client was doing a favor for a friend," Braun said. "He's not a political 
activist. . . . He regrets it now." 
</P>
<P>
"Do I ever!" exclaimed Altman. 
</P>
<P>
Vallen wound up receiving 109,916 votes in the election -- about 5,000 more 
than Cranston's slim victory margin over Zschau, then a congressman. Vallen's 
television commercials portrayed Vallen as a better conservative than Zschau.

U.S. SEEKS RULES TO PROTECT HEALTH WORKERS FROM AIDS, HEPATITIS B 
</P>

<P>
Employers of the nation's estimated 5.3 million health care workers would be 
required to protect them from blood-borne diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis B 
under new regulations proposed Monday by the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Health care professionals are truly on the front line," Labor Secretary Ann 
Dore McLaughlin said in announcing the proposals. "They're working to contain 
the problem. We must ensure that they are not victims of it." 
</P>
<P>
The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed that 
all employers be required to adopt safety programs using a strategy called 
"universal precautions," in which all blood and bodily fluids are presumed 
infectious and handled accordingly. Under that approach, the fluids are placed 
in leakproof containers or color-coded bags or labeled with a clear warning. 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said the new standards would affect health care workers at 620,000 
sites. The proposals are now subject to public comment and could take up to two 
years to become final. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules would require safety training and annual re-education of health 
care workers, as well as cleaning and maintenance employees, laundry workers, 
students and clinical staff -- anyone who may be exposed to potentially 
dangerous body fluids while working in a health care setting. 
</P>
<P>
Further, employers will be required to provide their workers with protective 
clothing, such as rubber gloves, masks and fluid-proof aprons, and must provide 
free hepatitis B vaccinations to workers who are regularly exposed to blood and 
body fluids. 
</P>
<P>
Labor groups and others who have been pushing for such action applauded the 
proposed regulations, although some complained that they were too long in 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased to see that they're finally coming out -- we've been 
waiting for them," said Donna Richardson, assistant director of congressional 
and agency relations for the American Nurses' Assn., which represents the 
nation's 1.8 million nurses.

BUSH ASSERTS HE WON CLEAR MANDATE IN VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN HAND AGAINST CONGRESS DOMINATED BY HIS FOES 
</P>

<P>
President-elect Bush, seeking to strengthen his hand against a Congress 
dominated by his opponents, asserted Monday that he won a convincing mandate on 
Election Day that should be honored in the rough-and-tumble political wrangling 
that is likely to follow his inauguration in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly seeking to mold by force of rhetoric the same sort of mandate awarded 
President Reagan because of his electoral victories, Bush derided those 
Democrats who have criticized the election as "issue-less and mandate-less." 
</P>
<P>
"When the American people vote, they have a right to expect their substantive 
decision will be heard," Bush declared before 500 campaign workers and 
volunteers who gathered in Washington to forward the names of suitable 
appointees for Bush Administration jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The vice president's remarks came as his transition appeared stalled by 
continuing difficulty in filling the final two Cabinet-level positions, those 
of energy secretary and coordinator of the nation's war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Transition co-chairman Craig Fuller, briefing reporters on the selection 
process, said that Bush has been vacillating on his announced plan to fill the 
Energy Department post with a nuclear industry veteran, and suggested that the 
agency's top echelon would be a balance between nuclear experience and that in 
the oil and gas industries. 
</P>
<P>
In another delayed announcement, campaign strategist Robert Teeter turned down 
the job of White House deputy chief of staff, opting instead to serve as a 
part-time domestic policy adviser. Teeter, who is deeply involved in Bush 
Administration planning, said that he based his decision on a desire not to 
uproot his Michigan-based family. 
</P>
<P>
In his address to the Presidential Personnel Advisory Committee, Bush cited his 
campaign themes of economic growth, a tough criminal justice system and 
improved environmental and educational programs. Since the election, Bush has 
been stung by comments that his victory represented less a confirmation of his 
proposals than a denial of Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Citing former President John F. Kennedy's often-quoted remark that a one-vote 
victory was a mandate, Bush declared that "in 1988, I think a majority of 
almost 7 million votes, a 4-1 majority in the states and the Electoral College, 
is a mandate, too. 
</P>
<P>
"That mandate isn't a set of issues and policies picked out of a hat or chosen 
at random," Bush added. "It's a program we've run a winning national campaign 
on. . . . There is a mandate." 
</P>
<P>
Bush specifically asked his volunteers to propose appointees who would further 
his views, and particularly called for the names of Latinos, blacks and Asians 
-- "not as tokens but as real talent," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Transition co-chairman Fuller, meanwhile, said that another list of names for 
the Energy Department secretary will be forwarded to Bush later this week. A 
list for drug czar has yet to be provided. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll keep providing him with lists until he feels, you know, that he's got 
the person on there that he would like to select," Fuller said. "There's no 
need to rule anybody absolutely out, but the fact is we're still searching." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush said last month that he hoped to fill the top energy post with 
someone familiar with the problems besetting the nation's nuclear industry, 
Fuller said Monday that "we've also looked at combinations which would have 
somebody who's got an oil and gas background at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Asked which way Bush is leaning, Fuller replied with a grin: "He's leaned both 
ways in the last few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Fuller also confirmed that former Defense Secretary Harold Brown, who served in 
the Jimmy Carter Administration, is under consideration. Another Carter 
Administration official, James R. Schlesinger, fell from favored status after a 
persistent campaign by oil and gas interests. Former Louisiana Rep. Henson 
Moore is believed to remain under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Among the sub-Cabinet jobs, Fuller said that no decision has been made on who 
will serve as a deputy to Defense Secretary-designate John Tower. On a list 
forwarded to Bush by Tower were the names of four potential nominees: General 
Motors Vice Chairman Donald Atwood; United Technologies executive William Paul; 
IBM executive Vincent Cook and TRW executive Johnny Foster. 
</P>
<P>
In the office of U.S. Trade Representative-designate Carla Anderson Hills, 
former Reagan Administration policy strategist Roger Porter will be deputy 
trade representative and Josh Bolton, formerly a trade specialist on the Senate 
Finance Committee's minority staff, will serve as general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Bush Cabinet designees will meet in Washington Thursday to discuss the budget 
and other concerns during the Administration's initial weeks, Fuller said.

SHULTZ, NEARING END OF HIS TERM, DEFENDS ACTIVE U.S. ROLE ABROAD

Secretary of State George P. Shultz, giving what is expected to be his 
valedictory address as a government official, defended U.S. activism in world 
affairs Monday and rebuffed analysts who contend America is on the decline. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly America's national interest is served best by being engaged, by 
continuing to shape the new developments we have done so much to create," he 
said, referring to what he called a new, more optimistic era of world affairs 
during President Reagan's eight years in office. 
</P>
<P>
In a philosophical speech to the Citizens Network for Foreign Affairs, an elite 
group of scholars, activists and former U.S. officials, Shultz hailed the 
concept of public service based on trust and voluntarism and said it must have 
an international dimension. 
</P>
<P>
"At our best, we work for a better world not because we're forced to do it but 
because we want to do it -- and because a better world is better for America. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't show the will to lead, no one else can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz railed against "false prophets" who have predicted that America is in 
decline because it is engaged abroad. 
</P>
<P>
These naysayers, whom he called "declinists," play to the "darker side, to the 
idea that America no longer has anything to give the world," but are wrong, 
Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
To reverse what he called the "erosion of public service," Shultz said that 
trust within government must be renewed, foreign aid funds restored and trade 
protectionism must be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Shultz, 67, who has served 6 1/2 years at the State Department and served 
earlier administrations as head of the Treasury, Labor Department and Budget 
Office, plans to leave Washington on Jan. 20 to return to academic life and 
semi-retirement in California.

JUDGE LETS REFUGEES HELD IN TEXAS LEAVE

Hundreds of Central American refugees, many of them living for weeks in a South 
Texas shantytown, were granted the right to leave Monday after a federal judge 
ordered the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to stop refusing them 
permission to travel while their asylum applications are being reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
The action, a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Filemon 
Vela in Brownsville, was greeted with cheers by an estimated 300 refugees who 
had been living in a field without running water or toilets. Their only shelter 
often was a piece of heavy plastic propped up by branches cut from nearby 
trees. Others stayed in the shell of the gutted Amber Motel in Brownsville, 
bathing at a nearby car wash. 
</P>
<P>
In all, nearly 2,000 aliens were believed to be in Brownsville under the INS 
travel restriction that took effect Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
"One would have to be blind not to recognize that we have a problem," said Vela 
in issuing the order, which will remain in effect pending a hearing Thursday, 
when he will hear arguments on issuing an indefinite permanent injunction 
against the INS. 
</P>
<P>
The INS, meanwhile, defended its policy, saying that it was designed to curb 
abuses in the asylum process that has created thousands of backlog cases in 
some cities. More than 30,000 Central Americans passed through the southern tip 
of Texas last year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of them are Nicaraguans -- about 16,000 since late May -- a huge increase 
brought on by the dual collapse of the Contra armies and the Sandinista 
economy. The INS position is that most of those now seeking asylum are doing so 
for economic reasons, not political ones, and therefore are not eligible for 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
But those who filed the suit that led to Vela's order contended that the INS 
action is inhumane, as well as a violation of provisions enacted by Congress in 
1980 to ensure fair asylum hearings. Further, they also said it is a policy 
that does not conform with federal guidelines that mandate a 30-day notice for 
major policy changes. Before the new rule went into effect Dec. 16, a refugee 
was allowed to apply for asylum where he or she planned to reside. The 
applications can often take months to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
"We are very heartened by the decision," said Robert Rubin of the San Francisco 
Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs, one of the organizations that 
participated in the suit. "We will vigorously pursue the case. There was 
tremendous exhilaration on the part of the refugees. Many of them told me they 
were leaving immediately." 
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling came after he rejected a request from INS lawyer David Ayala 
to delay action to give the government a chance to prepare further arguments. 
</P>
<P>
Brownsville, in one of the poorest regions in the United States, began feeling 
the pinch of the new INS rule in late December as more and more Central 
American refugees crossed the border and registered for asylum. And each one 
was told that he was required to stay in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Casa Oscar Romero, long a haven for refugees, quickly filled to its 200-person 
capacity, leaving hundreds of impoverished Central Americans to fend for 
themselves. Miami, another popular destination for refugees, also began to feel 
the pressure of a mounting population and a baseball stadium was transformed 
into a makeshift shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Friday, attorneys working on behalf of the refugees filed suit. The 
judge's action Monday came as some refugees faced a further dilemma. The owner 
of the land where many are squatting has complained that they are trespassing 
on his property.

PANETTA HOPES FOR DEAL WITH BUSH

<P>
In the looming battle of the budget between President-elect Bush and the 
Democrat-controlled Congress, the veteran California lawmaker who will play a 
key role is hoping that Bush will be more pragmatic and less partisan than his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
For Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), the new chairman of the House Budget 
Committee, taming the massive federal deficit is too important for the 
politics-as-usual confrontations that marked relations between the White House 
and Congress during President Reagan's two terms. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of conversations with some of Bush's key aides, however, Panetta 
fears that the new President's spending blueprint will not reflect the "kinder, 
gentler nation" that he promised during last year's election campaign. 
Particularly troubling to Panetta is Bush's insistence that he will not 
tolerate new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Cursed With a Lot of Debt' 
</P>
<P>
'I don't think we've got a lot of time," Panetta said in an interview, his 
tones emphasizing the importance that he attaches to the issue. "We've been on 
a borrowing, bailout and buyout binge for the last couple of years and we're 
cursed with a lot of debt. If we don't solve problems through leadership, we'll 
all suffer for it." 
</P>
<P>
Panetta belittled the budget submitted by President Reagan on Monday as "an 
interesting historical document." Failure by Bush to address the nation's 
deficit in a more credible way, he said, will persuade foreign investors to 
withdraw their funds and force the United States to look elsewhere to finance 
its red-ink hemorrhage of the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take a process of give and take between Congress and the 
President to deal with the tough choices," Panetta said. If Bush and 
congressional leaders do not meet quickly to hammer out a deficit-reduction 
package, he said, "then we're in for a longer period of recriminations. What 
you're basically doing is increasing the risk to the country." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
White House Deal Sought 
</P>
<P>
Panetta's views reflect those of the many congressional Democrats who want to 
make a deal with the White House that would involve tax increases as well as 
spending cuts. Some Republicans, weary of defending sharp cutbacks in domestic 
spending, have expressed similar goals. 
</P>
<P>
As a 12-year veteran of the House who was a Democratic commander on the losing 
side of the early budget wars with Reagan, Panetta has vast experience in the 
intricacies of the federal budget. Along the way, he has gained the respect of 
Republicans as well as mainstream Democrats in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"A little less free-spending than most Northern liberals, operating with 
extensive experience in government and an instinctive understanding of how it 
works, he built up credibility on both sides of the aisle," the nonpartisan 
reference work Politics in America once said of him. 
</P>
<P>
"Panetta has added a voice of calm reason and pragmatism to the highly 
political act of deciding how federal money should be raised and spent," the 
independent Almanac of American Politics said. 
</P>
<P>
Still a relatively youthful and energetic 50-year-old, this self-confessed 
budget junkie is coming to center stage when Bush's first budget, the 
continuing huge deficit and possible tax increases appear likely to dominate 
the congressional agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta's committee is scheduled to draw up its own spending and tax blueprint 
for House passage by April 15. Later, under the leadership of Sen. Jim Sasser 
(D-Tenn.), the new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, the Senate will 
adopt its own version of a budget, and a compromise measure will emerge from a 
Senate-House conference. 
</P>
<P>
Sasser, who speaks with a distinctive Tennessee twang, agrees with Panetta that 
the Reagan budget is unacceptable, but he fears that Bush might go along with 
its basic outlines anyway. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference with Panetta, Sasser said it would be "difficult, 
but not impossible" for Bush to submit an acceptable budget without proposing 
any increase in taxes this year. Panetta, by contrast, called a tax increase 
essential. 
</P>
<P>
There are other differences of tactics, if not strategy, among the ruling 
Democrats. Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.), professing cooperation with Bush, has 
rebuked Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) for 
suggesting a 15-cent increase in the federal gasoline tax as one way of cutting 
the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Wright, along with other top leaders, believes that Congress should await 
Bush's recommendations and not get out in front on the politically sensitive 
issue of raising taxes, particularly the gasoline tax, which hits the poor 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Panetta who, in the first instance, will guide the Democratic 
response to the Bush Administration budget. And he realizes that Bush will have 
difficulty moving away from his strong stance against new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush is not Ronald Reagan in that he doesn't have the political license 
to glide around this (deficit) issue," Panetta said. "Second, he doesn't have 
the economic cushion that Reagan did when he came into office." 
</P>
<P>
An economic crisis -- a recession or a dramatic drop in the dollar -- also 
could force Bush and Congress to settle any differences over the budget, 
Panetta noted. But that kind of shotgun marriage, he said, would erode 
confidence in American leadership. 
</P>
<P>
If a budget impasse pushes the deficit to more than $110 billion in fiscal 
1990, it would trigger automatic reductions in nearly all defense and domestic 
spending programs under the Gramm-Rudman law. Panetta calculated that as much 
as $15 billion might have to be chopped from defense and another $15 billion 
from domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no way," he said, "that this (Bush) Administration could accept this 
depth of defense cuts or that this Congress could accept that depth of domestic 
cuts." 
</P>
<P>
During the interview, Panetta rattled off budget figures and percentages from 
memory as others might recall baseball batting averages. He said he made a 
similar presentation to the President-elect, warning that there would be a 
scarcity of federal resources for any of Bush's promised programs unless the 
deficit could be narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta said he told Bush that the usual "smoke and mirrors" of budget-making 
no longer work. "The world is watching," he recalled telling Bush. "Foreign 
ministers and foreign investors, once they lose confidence, will begin to 
diversify their investments, and then where will we get the money to finance 
our debt?" 
</P>
<P>
What was Bush's reaction? "He didn't say I was wrong," Panetta replied. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Switched From GOP 
</P>
<P>
The new Budget Committee chairman was once a liberal Republican who worked for 
former California Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel. After serving as director of civil 
rights enforcement for the Health, Education and Welfare Department in the 
Richard M. Nixon Administration, Panetta switched parties, partly to protest 
what he said was a GOP leadership attack on moderate members of the party. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta was passed over for the chairmanship of the House Budget Committee in 
1985, when Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) and Wright, the 
majority leader, believed that he might be too independent and challenge their 
authority. Even so, he was drafted to participate in the November, 1987, budget 
summit that resulted in a package of spending reductions and new taxes after 
the October stock market crash. 
</P>
<P>
Bush should learn from that summit, Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
"The choices must be bipartisan," he said. "They must deal both with spending 
restraint and revenues and cover a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
As Panetta prepares for the 1989 battle of the budget, he recognizes that the 
process has its own internal rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just starting our annual budget dance," he told reporters with a smile. 
"We do it every year."

Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton) pledged to seek reelection in 1990 to help 
retain the 36th Congressional District seat for his party in the 1991 revision 
of district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
"I've decided to run again for another two-year term," the 68-year-old 
legislator said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown previously had committed himself only to completing the term he won in 
November, his ninth. The district includes parts of western Riverside and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
"A major consideration in deciding to run again is to assure it (the district) 
will not be made into a safe Republican one in the next reapportionment," Brown 
said. "In addition, my health is very good, and I am close to a committee 
chairmanship."

SUPREME COURT TO RULE ON 'DIAL-A-PORN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Supreme Court said Monday that it will decide whether Congress may outlaw 
so-called "dial-a-porn" messages, the sexually explicit telephone recordings 
that callers can reach through the 976 exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The high court said that it will review a ruling, issued in Los Angeles in July 
by U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima, on the Telephone Decency Act of 
1987, which makes it a crime to offer "by means of telephone . . . any obscene 
or indecent communication for commercial purposes to any person." 
</P>
<P>
In his split ruling, Tashima upheld the part of the law banning "obscene" 
messages, but he struck down the ban on less explicit "indecent" messages. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Los Angeles company that challenged the law, Sable Communications of 
California, and the Federal Communications Commission appealed Tashima's ruling 
(Sable vs. FCC, 88-515, and FCC vs. Sable, 88-525). 
</P>
<P>
Despite many past court rulings, both "obscenity" and "indecency" are somewhat 
hazy legal concepts. Nevertheless, the high court has made it clear that a 
local community, through a jury, can decide what is obscene. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Sable, which sells dial-a-porn services, contend that the law 
violates the free speech clause of the First Amendment. They say that Tashima's 
ruling would permit federal prosecutors to file suit in a "less tolerant" city 
such as Salt Lake City, charging that its dial-a-porn messages were obscene. 
That could have the effect, they say, of forcing adults in Los Angeles to live 
by standards set in a far more conservative community. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. attorneys maintain that the government has the right to protect children 
from indecency and there is no way to stop minors from calling dial-a-porn 
services. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the justices have struck down most government attempts to regulate 
sexually explicit books, magazines or movies. But in 1978, the court took a 
different tack regarding television and radio. These broadcasts are "pervasive" 
in the home and children have easy access to them, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
The dial-a-porn cases, to be argued in April, require the justices to decide 
whether telephone services can be regulated like television, because children 
can be exposed to them, or like a movie, because they require an individual to 
seek out and pay for the service. 
</P>
<P>
Begun in the early 1980s as telephone companies offered new for-pay services, 
the pre-recorded sexual messages, which usually cost $2 in addition to any 
toll, have become a big business. By 1984, dial-a-porn services averaged 
800,000 calls a day, prompting the move in Congress to ban the business 
entirely.

JIM MURRAY: YASTRZEMSKI REACHES HALL BY BEING HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he stepped into the batter's box, he had a ritual. It never varied. First, 
he would reach across the plate and tap the end of the bat on the outside 
corner. Then he would reach up one massive hand and carefully position the 
batting helmet just where he wanted it. He would crouch slightly like an animal 
about to spring. Then, he would hold the bat over his head like a Roman candle 
and cock an eye at the pitcher. If there were runners on base, the pitcher 
would curse silently. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy succeeding a legend. Just ask Gene Tunney. Just ask George 
Selkirk, who only had to be the next Babe Ruth. Ask any of the guys who had to 
replace John Wooden. Ask Hunk Anderson, who only had to replace Knute Rockne. 
Ask Larry Holmes. How many "new Bing Crosbys" do you think came and went? How 
would you like to do a part made famous by Clark Gable? 
</P>
<P>
It's why I always had an especial admiration for Carl Michael Yastrzemski. 
First of all, there was that name to get by. Linotypers the country over hoped 
he'd fail before they ran out of consonants. It was said that no one could ever 
spell his name right or get a fastball by him, no matter how long he played. 
</P>
<P>
And then, there was the fact he could never be himself. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Yastrzemski came up to the big leagues in baseball with the biggest monkey 
on his back of anyone since George Selkirk or whoever took over for Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
Yastrzemski, you see, was the man who was going to be the next Ted Williams. 
Try that for a load around your neck starting a career. 
</P>
<P>
The mystery is that Carl Yastrzemski wasn't out of baseball and back sacking 
potatoes in Southampton by his third summer in the grand old game. 
</P>
<P>
No one is the next Ted Williams. No one can live up to those unreasonable 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The astonishing thing is, Carl Yastrzemski darn near did. He ended up doing 
most of the things the real Ted Williams did. He did some things Williams 
didn't do -- get 3,000 hits, for example. He got almost as many home runs as 
Williams -- 452 to 521. He got more runs batted in -- 1,844 to 1,839. He scored 
more runs -- 1,816 to 1,798. 
</P>
<P>
He walked less and he didn't have as high an average. But in Ted Williams, we 
may be talking of the purest striker of the baseball in history. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Ted Williams never had to be anything but Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't easy being someone else. Carl Yastrzemski never became "the Splendid 
Splinter," "the Thumper," or "Teddy Ballgame." But he was a born striker of the 
baseball himself. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no matter what he did when he came up after Williams retired, it wasn't 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
If he got a single with the bases loaded, the crowd would sneer, "Ted would 
have hit a home run." 
</P>
<P>
When he won his first batting title with .321 in only his third year, fans 
sniffed, "Ted hit .406 when he won." 
</P>
<P>
If he led the league in average, the fans growled that he hit only 14 home 
runs. "Ted used to hit 30 or 40," they groused. 
</P>
<P>
If he struck out, the fans hissed, "Ted never struck out." 
</P>
<P>
Even the rest of the league got into the act. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an all-star from the neck down," growled the White Sox manager, Eddie 
Stanky, once. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, the all-star from the neck down went 6 for 9 against Stanky's 
thinking-man's hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1967, the man who wasn't Ted Williams became the man who was Carl 
Yastrzemski. He had one of those incandescent years only the great ones have. 
He became only the ninth man in modern baseball history to win the triple crown 
-- batting average, home runs, runs batted in. No one has won it since. 
</P>
<P>
He hit 44 home runs, 1 more than the real Ted Williams ever hit in a season. He 
led his team to the pennant. He probably had two of the greatest clutch games 
ever put together by a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
When the Minnesota Twins came into Boston needing only 1 win to clinch the '67 
pennant, Yastrzemski took over. He went 3 for 4 with a home run and 4 RBIs in 
the first game, then went 4 for 4 with a double, a run scored and 2 RBIs in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
In those two games, he went 7 for 8 with 6 RBIs and 2 runs scored and played 
the outfield caroms like Willie Hoppe. 
</P>
<P>
And all Boston went around wearing a lapel button reading, "Yaz, Sir, That's My 
Baby!" Without blushing. 
</P>
<P>
In the World Series that followed, Carl Yastrzemski hit 3 home runs, batted 
.400, made 16 putouts, some with leaping catches, and threw out 2 baserunners 
on the speediest team in the game, the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
But the event most of us will long remember in that Series is the sight of the 
great Yastrzemski, after an opening game that his team lost, 2-1, mostly 
because Carl went 0 for 4, coming out in the gloaming after the game to take 
hours of batting practice. It was the single most humbling position I had ever 
seen a superstar put himself in -- and this was from a guy who had been accused 
for years in Boston of being indifferent to the fate of his team, caring only 
for his stats. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Yastrzemski hit 2 home runs, went 3 for 4 and batted in 4 runs as 
the Cardinals got thumped and the Series got evened. 
</P>
<P>
He was never again compared to Ted Williams. Or anyone else. He went on to hit 
40 home runs in a year twice more, he won two more batting championships, he 
led the Red Sox to one more pennant. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, he did another thing Ted Williams did -- he made the Hall of Fame on 
the first bounce. Only the guys with identity all their own do that. 
</P>
<P>
And, if you chance to go to Fenway Park this season and you see some kid 
struggling out in left field or at the plate, if you listen carefully, you may 
hear some fan say disgustedly of a fly that bounces off the infamous left-field 
wall, "Yaz woulda had it!' 
</P>
<P>
And his seat companion will counter, "Yaz woulda got 2 on it!" 
</P>
<P>
And if the kid pops a single to left with 3 on, the fan will grumble, "Yaz 
woulda hit it out!" 
</P>
<P>
But the real Yastrzemski will know how to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
"Just be yourself, kid. When you hit 40 home runs, they'll be all yours!"

AFTER COLLEGE, AMERICAN STARS PLAY OVERSEAS -- OR NOT AT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The similarities between Michael Jordan and Cheryl Miller are striking. 
</P>
<P>
They both were consensus All-Americans who led their teams to National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. titles as sophomores and were named James Naismith 
Award winners as juniors. And both won gold medals in the 1984 Los Angeles 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
But here is where the similarity ends. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan was able to parlay his collegiate success into a career in the National 
Basketball Assn. For Miller, however, playing professional basketball in the 
United States was no more than a dream. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think it stinks that women cannot continue with their playing careers 
here in the United States," said Miller, who has not played competitively since 
the 1987 World Championships and is now a broadcaster for ABC Sports. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to follow the careers of the men who come out of college with big 
reputations and earn big paychecks. But those options don't exist for women. 
</P>
<P>
They can find a job in the United States, practice hard and try out for the 
next Olympic team. Or they can travel overseas to play professionally in 
countries such as Italy, Spain and Japan while retaining their amateur status. 
Or they can retire from basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Players such as 1984 Olympian Anne Donovan, who graduated from Old Dominion in 
1983, and 1988 Olympian Cynthia Cooper, who graduated from USC in 1986, elected 
to continue practicing in the hopes of another Olympic medal. 
</P>
<P>
Eight players on the 1988 U.S. women's team had played their last collegiate 
game more than a year before the Olympics, compared to only one (David 
Robinson) on the men's team. 
</P>
<P>
Many U.S. players have found a new playing life abroad. Three former USC 
players, Cooper and Pam and Paula McGee, are playing in Italy, as are Donovan 
and former Cal State Long Beach player LaTaunya Pollard. Cindy Brown, a 1988 
Olympian and former Cal State Long Beach standout, is playing in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Players who compete overseas are still considered amateurs because they are 
regarded as employees of the companies that own the teams. 
</P>
<P>
After Cooper graduated from USC, she played for a year in Spain before moving 
to Italy last season, when she led the Italian Federation League in scoring 
with an average of 40 points for her team, Primizie Parma. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it over here, in that I am not playing behind the shadow of anyone," 
said Cooper, who played on USC's national championship teams of 1983 and 1984. 
"I am getting a chance to fulfill a dream." 
</P>
<P>
In Italy, there are no high school or college teams, only clubs. There are 
about 30 clubs, divided into several divisions, and most of the Americans play 
in the First Division. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowds here are rowdy," Cooper said. "They really get on the referees 
here. If they feel that the referees cheated, they throw coins at him and spit 
on the opposing coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The officiating here is pretty weak. They let the Italian players get away 
with a lot of physical abuse on the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to look toward this as a business now, because the physical demand is 
so much that the fun is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper is paid well by league standards, about $80,000, tax free, a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Cooper is very important to the team and the league," said team president 
Johnny Bertolazzi. "She is a star. She is known all over the country, and 
everyone loves her. Everyone wants to meet and be with her." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper has adapted to the Italian life style and can speak the language well 
enough to get by. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very frustrating sometimes with the lack of communication," said Cooper, 
whose team also plays in the European Cup, a playoff of Europe's top club 
teams. "I am glad to be playing, but I plan to play just 2 more years here 
before moving on to other things." 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, LaTaunya Pollard was the first West Coast player to win the Wade 
Trophy, one of the top awards in women's basketball. She was a two-time 
consensus All-American and is Cal State Long Beach's career scoring leader with 
3,001 points. But after college, she had knee surgery, which caused her to lose 
her spot on the 1984 Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Now, nearly 6 years later, Pollard is married, has a 1-year-old daughter and is 
playing professionally in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a shame that you have to go so far away to play," said Pollard, who 
spent 1986 coaching at Long Beach while finishing her degree in physical 
education. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came over here in 1983, you could have only one American to a 
team, and they didn't pay well. Now, things have changed. With only soccer to 
compete with, women's basketball has really taken off. 
</P>
<P>
"I play for one of the richest teams in the league (Sidis Ancona, which is a 
grocery store chain). I hope to continue to have a good year so I can ask for 
whatever I want next season." 
</P>
<P>
Pollard plays in Ancona, which is a small city about a 4-hour drive from Rome. 
It is her third club in the 4 seasons she has been in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"When you are on a team which does not have a good year, you have a chance to 
switch teams, because that team may drop to the Second Division, and Americans 
can only play in the First Division," said Pollard, who considers the level of 
play in the First Division to be comparable to college Division II in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Pollard plans to play at least one more season, but said: "I have said that 
after every year." 
</P>
<P>
Another former USC star playing in Italy is Paula McGee. She and her twin, Pam, 
are playing for the same club team in Palermo, Sicily. 
</P>
<P>
Paula McGee did not go to Italy right out of college. She first had an 
unsuccessful tryout with the Harlem Globetrotters and a brief stint with the 
Dallas Diamonds of the now-defunct Women's Basketball League before traveling 
to Spain and then Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Although she is in her third year playing in Italy, McGee still has mixed 
feelings about it. 
</P>
<P>
"I go back and forth," McGee said. "I have never really loved it, but I am 
making a living over here. Some things still bother me, like having washers but 
no dryers, but overall, if you make an effort to get acclimated, things are 
OK." 
</P>
<P>
McGee still thinks that a professional league can make it in the United States, 
but only if presented right. 
</P>
<P>
"First off, you cannot have a team in Los Angeles, because there is too much of 
a strain on the fan's entertainment dollar," McGee said. "You have to accept 
the fact that you'll lose money at first, but if you keep it in small places 
like Norfolk, Va., and Ruston, La., the players would start staying home." 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Miller, who emerged as the celebrity of women's basketball during her 
playing career at USC, was supposed to have an unlimited future. In college, 
Miller was called the best female player in the world. She was a three-time 
Naismith Award winner and a member of the 1984 Olympic gold-medal winning team. 
But she did not make the 1988 Olympic team because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the time after her last game) was the worst experience of my life," Miller 
said. "I had always felt that when I was done with basketball, everyone would 
be knocking at my door. 
</P>
<P>
"Here I was, preparing myself to make a tough decision on whether to meet with 
Johnny (Carson) or Joan (Rivers) once I returned home from Rome, and the only 
call I had was from my aunt, who said she had seen me on television." 
</P>
<P>
Although she had offers from foreign teams, Miller did not want to leave the 
United States. So she and her attorney, Arn Tellem, started knocking on media 
doors. ABC decided to give Miller a chance to do color commentary and features, 
although she had no experience. 
</P>
<P>
"I hated my first year at ABC," said Miller, who also works for ESPN and other 
cable networks. "I'm a perfectionist, and I wanted to be the best, but it was 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
"I am doing other things now. I was the sideline reporter during the 
USC-Stanford football game this season, and I will get a chance to do 
commentary on my first men's game in March, and the women's Final Four." 
</P>
<P>
Miller had hoped to conclude her playing career in the Seoul Olympics, but the 
knee injury, suffered in April, 1987, kept her from making the team. 
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic trials were a nightmare," Miller said. "I often think that I would 
have been better off if I had not tried, but I would have hated myself if I 
hadn't." 
</P>
<P>
Despite her efforts, Miller was sent home before the final cut. She denies that 
she quit the team. 
</P>
<P>
"For various reasons, I was just not good enough to make the team," Miller 
said. "Everything could have been handled differently, but I just want to let 
it die. I am glad that the women won." 
</P>
<P>
Miller admits now that her playing career is over. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have loved to continue to play basketball here in the U.S.," said 
Miller, who says she never considered playing abroad. "But, there are not any 
leagues to do so. The guys just do not know how lucky they are to get money to 
play the game they love. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to see myself as flamboyant when I played, but now I am a more private 
person. I cherish my time alone at home. I just wish I could have played 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
Rhonda Windham, another former Trojan star, also decided to end her basketball 
career. She graduated from USC in 1987 and now is coaching in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"I am a demonstrative instructor in developing players 12 to 18 years old," 
Windham said. "I really like what I am doing. I am getting paid well, and I am 
also teaching English in a classroom." 
</P>
<P>
Windham, who won the 1987 Francis Pomeroy Naismith Award as the nation's top 
player under 5 feet 6 inches, first tried a career in marketing. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not like working in that kind of atmosphere," said Windham about her 
career in marketing, which lasted 3 months. "I knew that I was going to the 
Olympic trials in April, so I was just trying to bide time." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Windham, the trials were a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart just was not into it," she said. "I did not have the burning desire 
to make the team. I had no desire within, and it showed." 
</P>
<P>
After she failed to make the team, Windham went home to New York until she 
heard from her agent about a job coaching in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything happened so fast," Windham said. "In 3 days' time, I was off to 
Italy, and things have really taken off." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

DETROIT USES DEFENSE TO END MONTREAL'S 9-GAME STREAK

The Detroit Red Wings emphasized defense to end the Montreal Canadiens' 9-game 
winning streak Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Barr's goal early in the third period turned out to be the game-winner as 
Montreal was held to just 6 shots over the final 30 minutes 18 seconds and 
lost, 3-2, at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen the forwards come back like that in a while," said Detroit 
defenseman Lee Norwood, who was a key to the strong defensive effort in front 
of goalkeeper Greg Stefan. "When we do it that way, there's not many that do it 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal entered the game with a 15-1-3 record in its last 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody puts in a little more to beat us to try to get themselves going," 
Montreal Coach Pat Burns said. "This should get the Red Wings going." 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, New York Rangers 4 -- Jim Korn, who will begin serving a 
suspension next week, scored 2 goals and Joe Cirella knocked in the game-winner 
as the Devils beat the Rangers at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Cirella's goal at 10:46 of the third period -- after Korn had tied the game in 
the second -- gave the Devils their third straight victory and ended New York's 
7-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 3, Vancouver 0 -- Ed Olczyk scored 2 goals and goalkeeper Allan Bester 
made 32 saves as the Maple Leafs shut out the Canucks at Toronto.

SUPERSONICS STOP CAVALIERS' 11-GAME STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Cleveland Cavaliers' winning streak ended at 11 Monday night when Derrick 
McKey's rebound-dunk with 5 seconds left lifted the Seattle SuperSonics to a 
105-103 victory at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland had 21 turnovers, including 2 of its final 3 possessions, which cost 
the Cavaliers the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take care of the ball," Cleveland Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "A lot 
of the little things we haven't been doing lately, we did tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, who have won 5 straight games and 11 straight at home, scored 
the final 6 points, overcoming a 103-99 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Ellis scored on a dunk with 48 seconds remaining, and McKey tied the score 
with 2 free throws at the 28-second mark. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland ran the clock down to 9 seconds and took a timeout. On the inbounds 
pass, John Williams threw the ball out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Sedale Threatt took a 20-foot jump shot with 8 seconds remaining and 
McKey, who scored a career-high 32 points, got the rebound and scored the 
winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' 12-footer with 1 second remaining bounced off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers played without guard Mark Price, who injured his knee Saturday in 
a game against the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 121, Dallas 103 -- Ron Anderson scored 8 of his 23 points during a 
26-10 second-quarter run that broke open a close game as the 76ers beat the 
Mavericks at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
The 76ers built a 57-41 lead with 3:06 remaining in the second period that 
included 4 consecutive 3-point baskets. Derek Harper, who led Dallas with a 
career-high 38 points, scored all the Mavericks' points during a 10-2 run over 
the rest of the period, including 2 3-pointers, cutting the lead to 59-51 at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas, falling to its fourth straight loss, closed to within 7 points midway 
through the third quarter before Philadelphia regained command. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 114, Charlotte 92 -- Karl Malone scored 38 points and had 19 rebounds, 
leading the Jazz past the Hornets at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz, which led, 28-20, after the first quarter, extended the lead to 60-33 
at halftime, hitting 8 of the first 9 field goals in the second quarter and 
limiting Charlotte to 5 of 17 field goals. Utah led by as many as 36 in the 
fourth quarter in handing the Hornets their fourth loss in their 5 games. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly Tripucka, playing against his former teammates, led Charlotte with 19 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 130, Phoenix 124 -- Chris Mullin scored 39 points and registered 
his first National Basketball Assn. triple-double to pace the Warriors past the 
Suns at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Mullin also had 11 rebounds and 11 assists before fouling out with 1:57 left. 
His performance helped the Warriors snap the Suns' 5-game winning streak.

SCOTT OSTLER: THESE TEAMS WEREN'T ON EQUAL FOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Ostler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Football -- along with building character and keeping America's couch potatoes 
from clogging up the jogging paths every weekend -- is educational. 
</P>
<P>
Take last Sunday, for instance. I learned a lot watching the Bengals and 49ers 
beat the Bills and Bears. 
</P>
<P>
Until Sunday, I thought Ickey Woods was where Al Davis has sent his coaching 
staff for its postseason vacation. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that Ickey Woods is the running back for the Cincinnati Bengals, 
the team with the ickey helmets. Woods ran for 102 yards and 2 touchdowns 
Sunday, despite a condition that the TV announcers referred to as "sticky turf" 
at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Considered a growing problem rivaling crabgrass, "sticky turf" occurs on an 
artificial surface when the weather turns cold. Riverfront Stadium became an 
acre of flypaper. Nobody actually stuck to the sticky turf, but the footing was 
too good, messing with the natural running style of most of the players. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Ickey was less sticky. After each of his touchdowns, Woods went 
into his Ickey Shuffle, the dance sensation that is sweeping the Bengal roster. 
Ickey's teammates joined him Sunday, introducing the Ickey Woo Woo, an offshoot 
of the Shuffle, patent pending. 
</P>
<P>
The Woo Woo caught the Bills by surprise, illustrating why coaches consider it 
vital to keep pregame practices closed to the press and public. Had the Bills 
gotten wind of the Woo Woo, Buffalo Coach Marv Levy would have appealed to Pete 
Rozelle to outlaw the dance as unsportsmanlike. 
</P>
<P>
But even though Ickey pulled it off, there is concern in Cincinnati that he 
showed too much too soon. Should Woods have saved his Woo Woo for the Super 
Bowl? You don't want to show all your cards too early. 
</P>
<P>
Another theory, however, is that Woods has an even more elaborate dance ready, 
a conga line anchored by Bengal Coach Sam Wyche and called the Ickey Choo-Choo. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, by halftime, the Bills were in deep Woo Woo. They saved too much of 
their intensity for after the whistle and after the game, and they won't be 
with us come Super Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, meanwhile, footing also played a big part in the game. Instead of 
sticky turf, the 49ers and Bears had to contend with no grass at all, a surface 
that will someday be marketed as Lack O' Turf. The 49ers and Bears skated 
around on green dirt that was frozen to the firmness of Italian marble. 
</P>
<P>
The players went through so many shoe changes that this game will go down in 
history as the Imelda Marcos Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Some pregame analysts predicted doom for the 49ers, who would be undone by the 
ferocious Midwest weather. The 49ers, obviously running scared, brought 
truckloads of foul-weather gear to Chicago. They brought everything but a 
22-man hot tub. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers are a finesse team whose coach plays tennis and whose team mascot is 
probably a French poodle. The weather, said the experts, would kill the 
delicate 49er spirit. 
</P>
<P>
One Chicago radio DJ knew better. He realized his team was in trouble and that 
desperate measures were called for. He urged his listeners to go to the 49ers' 
hotel in downtown Chicago the night before the game and keep the players awake 
by banging trash-can lids. 
</P>
<P>
From this, we learn how much electronic journalism has evolved over the years. 
I don't remember this kind of creativity from Walter Cronkite. 
</P>
<P>
As brilliant plans go, the trash-can bit ranked just ahead of Mike Ditka's idea 
of starting Jim McMahon at quarterback. If Ditka's plan was to keep Mike 
Tomczak fresh for the Super Bowl, it worked perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
The weather in Chicago was "man's weather," according to John Madden. When the 
TV cameras showed the Soldier Field luxury boxes, where fans sit in 
glass-enclosed comfort, Madden fumed: "Those people shouldn't even be here! 
That doesn't even count! If you can't take the elements, you should stay home." 
</P>
<P>
Madden, no doubt, opened his press-box window to let in some fresh, manly air. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the magic of Joe Montana and Jerry Rice, what stood out in this game 
was the work of the NFL instant replay officials. Once, with the "Instant 
Replay Delay" clock, superimposed on the screen, ticking past 3 minutes, Madden 
bristled, "They (replay officials) see the same pictures we do, I don't know 
why they're taking so much time!" 
</P>
<P>
This is why: The replay officials are skittish, indecisive men who are looking 
for solid evidence that a play should be overruled. If our nation's judicial 
system insisted on evidence as ironclad, we would shut down all our prisons and 
save a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
On the replay of the Jerry Rice touchdown catch in the end zone, which was 
ruled (by field officials) no catch, the replay officials should have said: 
"It's pretty clear to us that the feller caught the ball despite hitting the 
ground. He didn't trap it or bobble it. Give him the TD." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, it made no difference. The 49ers poured it on anyway, and by the 
fourth quarter most of those hardy Bears' fans were heading out to the Soldier 
Field parking lot to start their postgame tailgate parties. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers couldn't have been more impressive if they had played the second half 
barefoot. They were easily the best team in action Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Advice to Bengals: Put the Shuffle and Woo Woo on the back burner and send your 
equipment man out for trash-can lids.

DICK VERSACE BRINGS MANY FACES TO PACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Presumably, the woeful Indiana Pacers were only looking for a good basketball 
coach, not some type of renaissance man, when they hired Detroit Pistons 
assistant Dick Versace late last week. 
</P>
<P>
Turns out, the Pacers got both. Victories over the Clippers and the Pistons on 
consecutive nights last weekend signaled a change for the better in the Pacers' 
play. And, as a bonus, Versace has proven to be a true character, someone who 
makes quirky coaching colleagues Jerry Reynolds and Doug Moe seem tame by 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
This eclectic -- eccentric? -- man once studied plant pathology in college, 
entertains romantic visions of chasing Ernest Hemingway's ghosts in the cafes 
of Paris, spent time in the Coast Guard and was a high school football coach of 
some renown at Forrest, Wis., the self-described "Egg Capital of America, and 
That Ain't No Yoke." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it takes a man with an adventuresome streak and Hemingway's macho 
posturing to coach the Pacers, who have been a movable feast for NBA opponents 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Versace's hiring, the Pacers had lost 45 of 61 games since last 
February, including 6-23 this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not accept losing with this team or any team I coach," Versace said at 
his introductory news conference. "When I speak to the players, that will be my 
opening comment." 
</P>
<P>
That pep talk must have done wonders, because the Pacers are 2-0 under Versace. 
They beat the Clippers by 35 points Friday night and the Pistons by 14 Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Versace, who guided Bradley University into the National Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. tournament and subsequent probation, had a secure and successful job as 
Chuck Daly's top assistant at Detroit before the Pacers came calling. 
</P>
<P>
Radical career shifts are nothing new to Versace, 48, so he did not hesitate 
when asked to replace George Irvine, who replaced Jack Ramsay as coach. Despite 
victories in Versace's first 2 games, the Pacers still are at least a season 
away from respectability. 
</P>
<P>
Versace, however, says he is used to challenges. He had a winning record with 
that Wisconsin high school football team he coached, as well as starting a 
fashion trend in town -- the wearing of derby hats. In 8 seasons at Bradley, he 
turned a losing program around, guiding the Braves to a 32-3 record in 1985-86. 
However, Versace was asked to resign in the wake of NCAA probation. 
</P>
<P>
Versace said his personality and coaching have been shaped as much by Hemingway 
as former Marquette Coach Al McGuire, both of whom he considers influences. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started to read Hemingway, I started to realize it was not unmanly to 
love nature and to be contemplative and philosophical," Versace said. "I was 
considering being an expatriate in Paris for a couple of years. It sounded like 
an interesting way to live. I could sit around the outdoor cafes, plan my day. 
That's what they do. They wrote poetry and novels and short stories and traded 
ideas, went to the flea market, had love affairs. It was a really exciting 
period of time." 
</P>
<P>
Versace's time as the Pacers' coach doesn't figure to be boring. But if he 
eventually is fired, he can always take up plant pathology again. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to be a research scientist," Versace said. "But I was too much of 
an extrovert to sequester myself in a greenhouse doing research on corn rust." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
If you aspire to be an NBA head coach, it is recommended to first serve as an 
assistant to Chuck Daly at Detroit. Versace is the third of Daly's former 
assistants to become an NBA coach. The others are Dick Harter at Charlotte and 
Ron Rothstein at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"Chuck doesn't want anyone working for him who doesn't want to be a head 
coach," Versace said. "He's the quintessential man's man." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's why Brendan Suhr, the assistant general manager and scouting 
director of the Atlanta Hawks, resigned to take Versace's vacated position at 
Detroit, which would appear to be a step down. 
</P>
<P>
Folks in Atlanta weren't happy to see Suhr join the Hawks' archrival in the 
Central Division. In fact, Stan Kasten, Atlanta's general manager, pulled what 
he called a good-natured prank on Suhr when he gave his notice. 
</P>
<P>
When Suhr arrived at the Omni for work, he discovered that his name on his 
parking space had been painted over and that another car was parked there. 
Suhr's name also had been removed from his mail slot and office door. 
</P>
<P>
However, Kasten did pay for Suhr's plane ticket to New Jersey, where he scouted 
a game later that night. 
</P>
<P>
The team most likely to make a major trade figures to be the ailing San Antonio 
Spurs, who want to improve their supporting cast before David Robinson joins 
the team after fulfilling his Navy commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Red McCombs, the Spurs' owner, said he wants to make a blockbuster trade 
similar to one he completed as the Denver Nuggets' owner in 1984, in which the 
Nuggets acquired Fat Lever, Calvin Natt and others for Kiki Vandeweghe. 
</P>
<P>
McCombs apparently had a meeting with Coach Larry Brown and General Manager Bob 
Bass to plan strategy. 
</P>
<P>
"Something obviously is missing," McCombs said. "We spent an hour on it. We 
asked, 'Do we stay as we are?' The answer is no. We have to do better." 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that the Spurs want to acquire Vandeweghe, back from a chronic 
back ailment, from Portland. But the videotape of Vandeweghe in practice that 
the Spurs recently received didn't stay a secret long, even though the Trail 
Blazers did it with a hidden camera. Brown's reaction to the Vandeweghe tapes: 
"It was like a tape a father would take of his son in high school." 
</P>
<P>
Denver Coach Doug Moe recently watched talk-show host Morton Downey, an 
archconservative, on TV, and he knew he had seen him before. In fact, Downey 
signed Moe to his first professional contract with the American Basketball 
Assn.'s New Orleans Buccaneers in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"After a few months, he got fired. But he spent a lot of money," Moe told a 
Denver newspaper. "I don't think management liked that too much. I caught his 
TV show a couple of times. I'll give him this. He's one of the all-time 
showmen. You sit and laugh. He likes to stir things up, and you know I'm in 
total agreement with that." 
</P>
<P>
A New Year's resolution from Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers: 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've got to make a strong commitment to my girlfriends and my family. 
Well, don't write down my girlfriends," said Barkley, emphasizing the plural. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rough week for New York Knicks Coach Rick Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
First, he was fined $3,000 by the league for failing to leave the court after 
being ejected from a game. Pitino, in fact, sat in a seat near the corridor and 
relayed messages to his assistant coaches through a public relations man. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, was minor compared to the turmoil that surfaced between Pitino 
and rookie guard Rod Strickland. Pitino is not taken with Strickland's 
attitude, and Strickland is not happy with his playing time as Mark Jackson's 
backup at point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Rod is nowhere near the player you guys make him out to be," Pitino told New 
York writers. And, at one point in a recent game, Pitino was overheard saying 
to Strickland, "I'm tired of your Joe Cool attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Pitino's criticism of Strickland drew criticism from Knick General Manager Al 
Bianchi, who told Newsday that he plans to reprimand Pitino. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't knock your players to the press," Bianchi said. "You keep it 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
According to one report, the Knicks are trying to put together a 3-way trade 
that would send Strickland to the Indiana Pacers, Indiana's Wayman Tisdale to 
the Portland Trail Blazers and Vandeweghe to the Knicks, who have long coveted 
the Trail Blazer forward. 
</P>
<P>
Recently waived Utah Jazz guard Brad Kofoed filed a grievance through the NBA 
Players' Assn. last weekend, seeking about $80,000 of his $125,000 guaranteed 
contract this season. 
</P>
<P>
Kofoed was waived after a fight with teammate -- and friend -- Bobby Hansen at 
a New Year's Eve party. Hansen suffered a broken cheekbone and underwent 
surgery last week. Club officials said Hansen probably will need a second 
operation and may not return until late April. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Kofoed was waived and not paid. David Checketts, the Jazz's 
general manager, said Kofoed violated a good-citizen clause in his contract.

BILL TERRY, LAST PLAYER TO HIT .400 IN NL, DEAD AT 90 
</P>

<P>
Hall of Famer Bill Terry, the last player to bat .400 in the National League, 
died Monday at 90 of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
Terry died in Jacksonville, where he has lived since 1949, after several months 
of failing health. 
</P>
<P>
Terry spent all of his major league playing career, from 1923-36, with the New 
York Giants. He batted .401 in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
The first baseman had a lifetime average of .341 and drove in 100 or more runs 
for 6 consecutive seasons, starting in 1927. He finished his career with 1,078 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
He was a player-manager for the Giants, beginning in 1932. He retired as 
manager in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
Terry succeeded an ailing John McGraw as the team's manager and led the Giants 
to the World Series championship in 1933. New York also reached the Series 
under Terry in 1936 and 1937. 
</P>
<P>
After joining the Giants in 1923, Terry had to wait 2 seasons while the Giants 
used George Kelly at first base. Terry, not lacking in confidence, kept pecking 
away at McGraw, causing the first of their many disputes. 
</P>
<P>
"Why this fellow isn't even half a first baseman," McGraw said of Terry, "and 
wants twice as much money as a real player." 
</P>
<P>
Terry finally took over as the starting first baseman in 1925 and batted .319 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what his formula for hitting was, he said: "Confidence, my boy, 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Terry was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1954, though many said he would have 
received the honor years earlier if he had enjoyed better rapport with 
sportswriters, who elect Hall of Famers. 
</P>
<P>
Terry left baseball entirely in 1941 and said he would not return to the game. 
But in 1954, he was elected president of the Class-A South Atlantic League. 
Later, Terry became president of the minor league Jacksonville (Fla.) Braves. 
</P>
<P>
Terry's wife, Vena, died in 1983. He is survived by three sons and a daughter.

North Carolina State officials sent a letter to the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. Monday asking for an investigation into allegations of illegal 
activity in the school's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to NCAA President Dick Schultz, which is signed by athletic director 
and basketball Coach Jim Valvano and Chancellor Bruce Poulton, cites 
allegations on the jacket of the book "Personal Fouls" by Peter Golenbock. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations included illegal gifts of jewelry and cars to players, the 
changing of grades by faculty and university officials and the passing of large 
amounts of secret money from the booster club. North Carolina State officials 
deny all of the allegations.

The drunk-driving manslaughter trial of former Olympic diver Bruce Kimball 
began before a judge who was prepared to move the highly publicized case to 
Gainesville, Fla., if an impartial jury cannot be seated at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Kimball, 25, is charged with two counts of drunk-driving manslaughter and three 
counts of drunk driving involving serious bodily injury in connection with an 
Aug. 1 traffic accident that killed two teen-agers and injured four others at a 
roadside meeting place known as "The Spot" in suburban Brandon, Fla.

The NFL says the Cincinnati Bengals could have used their quick-snap tactics in 
the AFC championship game against the Buffalo Bills, despite a pregame 
statement that seemed to outlaw the practice. 
</P>
<P>
League spokesman Joe Browne said a misunderstanding led the Bengals to believe 
the quick snap was prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals will be allowed to use the quick snap in the Super Bowl against San 
Francisco, as long as they aren't in the process of changing offensive players 
when they decide to do so, Browne said.

Women who drink beverages with caffeine may take longer to become pregnant, say 
scientists at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in 
Research Triangle Park, N.C. The study was published in December in The Lancet, 
a British medical journal. A group of 104 women planning to become pregnant 
provided data on the amount of caffeinated beverages they consumed during the 
time they tried to conceive, the study said. Women who drank more than one cup 
of caffeinated coffee a day, or the equivalent in tea and colas, took 
significantly longer to become pregnant than women who drank less. "Our data 
suggests that it is the women's current caffeine consumption, not her past 
habits, that affects her fertility," said Dr. Allen J. Wilcox, principal 
investigator.

BABY FOUND SAFE IN DITCH

A 10-month-old girl, believed to have spent two cold nights in a drainage ditch 
after her mother was struck by a hit-and-run driver's car while trying to cross 
Interstate 5 on foot with a group of illegal aliens, was in good condition at 
Scripps Memorial Hospital in Chula Vista. The baby, apparently suffering from 
mild hypothermia, was returned to Onecima Lopez, 30, who was in the hospital 
with both legs broken. Lopez told police that another of the group was carrying 
her baby and that she assumed someone would take the child to Los Angeles, 
where her husband had applied to become a legal U.S. resident. The baby, 
however, was found in the drainage ditch by other migrants, who stopped a cab 
driver and told him to take her to police.

Severe weather struck more than one region of the country. Snow squalls whipped 
by icy winds off Lake Ontario dumped up to 20 inches of snow on parts of 
northern New York, producing whiteouts and drifts that brought traffic to a 
standstill along a 10-mile stretch of Interstate 81, a major route to Canada. 
An unusual storm hit the South, icing over highways and bridges from 
Mississippi into the western mountains of North Carolina. That storm followed a 
warm spell in which temperatures were up to 20 degrees above the normal 45- to 
50-degree range since mid-December along Mississippi's Gulf Coast. A storm from 
the Pacific brought snow, freezing rain and strong winds to the West. Winds 
gusted to 103 m.p.h. at Boulder, Colo., 79 m.p.h. at Ft. Collins, Colo., and 58 
m.p.h. at Casper, Wyo.

Rival Shia Muslim militia members battled each other in "horrific" fighting in 
which Syrian-backed Amal guerrillas recaptured strategic southern Lebanese 
villages from fundamentalists, police said. At least 80 people have been killed 
in the house-to-house combat between the mainstream Amal militia and the 
fundamentalist, Iranian-allied Hezbollah since daybreak Sunday, police said. A 
police spokesman in Sidon said that the fighters were committing "horrific 
atrocities . . . knifing, hacking and gunning each other" in the continuing 
power struggle.

Israeli troops shot and wounded 26 Palestinians during clashes, according to 
Arab reports, as a general strike ordered by Islamic fundamentalists and 
PLO-backed leaders took effect in the occupied territories. The worst clash 
erupted in the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli 
soldiers opened fire on stone-throwing youths and wounded 11, Arab reporters 
said. The army confirmed that 16 people were wounded in several clashes. 
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told the president of the European 
Parliament, Lord Plumb, that the European Community is siding too much with the 
Palestinians to play an active role in any peace process.

Central American leaders announced that they will postpone a summit aimed at 
restarting the stalled regional peace process. The delay was proposed by 
President Oscar Arias Sanchez of Costa Rica, architect of a 1987 peace plan for 
the region, who said that the presidents of the five concerned nations should 
wait until after President-elect Bush takes office Jan. 20. Foreign Minister 
Ricardo Acevedo Peralta of El Salvador said that the summit, originally 
scheduled for Sunday and Monday in San Salvador, is to take place sometime next 
month.

China released a 33-year-old dissident who was active in the pro-democracy 
movement in Shanghai. Yang Wei, a former student at the University of Arizona 
whose case was taken up by the U.S. Congress, was freed after serving one year 
of a two-year prison term for "demagogical propaganda for counterrevolutionary 
ends." Yang said he did not regret marching for democracy and writing for China 
Spring, the banned periodical of the Chinese Alliance for Democracy, a New 
York-based dissident group, but said he didn't know whether he would continue 
working for political change in China.

President Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia opened the 19th African-American 
Conference here Monday by calling on the international community to reflect on 
the African debt crisis and the problem of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
Kaunda told the conference, attended by several black leaders from the United 
States -- including civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and former U.S. 
Ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young -- that the two problems are the 
fundamental cause of suffering on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
He said that even though the U.N. economic program for the continent dates to 
1969, no action has been taken to implement it because of inadequate 
international support. 
</P>
<P>
The Zambian president welcomed the signing of the tripartite agreement between 
South Africa, Cuba and Angola but expressed surprise at how the international 
community was supporting apartheid.

30 HOMELESS, $1.3-MILLION DAMAGE IN FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

An early morning fire destroyed an Anaheim senior citizens complex under 
construction and is believed to have sparked a second blaze on a shake roof 
less than a mile away, leaving more than 30 people homeless and causing an 
estimated $1.3 million in damage, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the sleeping residents of the Casa Granada apartment complex were 
awakened by booming sounds and billowing clouds of smoke, while others were 
alerted by neighbors and passers-by who pounded on doors during the 1:40 a.m. 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Six second-floor apartments were gutted by the fire, and at least six others 
were damaged, causing about $400,000 in damage, Anaheim fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One woman who helped evacuate residents cut her foot when she kicked in a 
window at the apartment fire. 
</P>
<P>
And four firefighters were treated for minor cuts, bruises and smoke inhalation 
in the construction site fire, Anaheim fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 residents of the complex in the 2500 block of West Winston Road 
have been relocated to other apartments or temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Many had only the clothing on their backs and those few articles they could 
gather before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
The first blaze broke out about 12:23 a.m. at a construction site at 2200 
Colchester Drive, near the intersection of Ball Road and Brookhurst Street. 
Flames engulfed the framing of what was to have been the Horizon Village senior 
citizens apartment complex, causing about $900,000 in damage, Anaheim fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire at the construction site is under investigation, Anaheim 
city spokeswoman Carolyn Griebe said. 
</P>
<P>
Embers from that fire may have touched off the second fire at the apartment 
complex, which is less than a mile away, Griebe said, adding that flames then 
spread quickly across the shake roofs of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
According to Anaheim Fire Department operations division chief Bob Young, about 
50 firefighters controlled the Horizon Village fire within 45 minutes, and 35 
firefighters fought the second blaze, which also took about 45 minutes to 
control. 
</P>
<P>
"Just as we were starting to release the units on the first one, the second one 
came in," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said efforts by neighbors and passers-by prevented serious 
injuries in the apartment complex fire. 
</P>
<P>
Brad McMillan, 27, was walking home from the Club Coronado Bar, around the 
corner from the Casa Granada complex, about 1:35 a.m. when he noticed a glow of 
flames and smoke coming from the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no fire trucks yet when I got here," said McMillan, who lives 
across the street from the complex. "I ran upstairs and started kicking doors 
to get people out." 
</P>
<P>
Gail Moore is one resident McMillan alerted. "A guy was pounding on our door, 
and I thought he was trying to break in," she said. "I had heard noises outside 
for about half an hour, but I didn't know anything was burning." Moore, 25, and 
a friend fled the fire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passers-By Awakened People 
</P>
<P>
Two passers-by from Garden Grove -- Brett Miller, 18, and Patrick Long, 21 -- 
also helped to awaken sleeping residents at the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
"People were pretty much sound asleep," said David Serrania, whose second-floor 
apartment was destroyed by the fire. "If it wasn't for the guys running up and 
down the balcony, we probably would have been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first got outside, the fire engines still hadn't arrived, and people 
were still running out of their apartments to the street." 
</P>
<P>
Serrania said he was awakened by loud noises that he thought signaled another 
earthquake. But when he noticed clouds of smoke billowing outside his bedroom 
window, he said he awakened his wife, Karrie, grabbed their 13-month-old son, 
David Matthew, and hurried out of the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I just grabbed my son, our wallets and some photo albums and got out," Karrie 
Serrania said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In Time by 30 Seconds 
</P>
<P>
About 30 seconds later, fire raced through Serrania's apartment, destroying it. 
</P>
<P>
"The windows just started exploding," said Serrania, who fled in a blue robe 
and stocking feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We were only able to save the things that were sitting by the door," said 
Moore, whose apartment was destroyed. "I was lucky I put out my fiance's suit 
for his first day at work (Monday)." 
</P>
<P>
Thong Le and his wife, Emily Ho, who is 4 1/2 months pregnant, also lost nearly 
everything. "My wife is very upset and cried all the time because we didn't get 
our marriage album," said Le, who escaped from the fire wearing only a T-shirt, 
sweat pants and a pair of shoes -- one black and one brown. 
</P>
<P>
"I had just bought a new refrigerator, VCR and a television," said Le, who got 
married 6 months ago. "We were just getting settled." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evacuation Center Opened 
</P>
<P>
The county chapter of the American Red Cross opened an evacuation center at 
nearby Magnolia High School for the Casa Granada residents early Monday 
morning. Casa Granada residents were allowed to return to the complex about 9 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the complex, I.P.S. Property Management, has provided housing for 
most of the displaced families in apartments still intact in the Casa Granada 
complex and the Singing Tree apartment complex on Ball Road in Anaheim. A 
spokesman for I.P.S. said the company will temporarily furnish evacuees 
apartments for 1 month. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross officials said they also are providing the families with clothes, 
food, and linens. 
</P>
<P>
Karrie Serrania said she and her husband had been preparing to move into a 
larger apartment in about 2 weeks: "We were moving because we had so much 
stuff. Now, we have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Lucille Renwick also contributed to this story.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS BONIN CONVICTION AND DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP HAGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Supreme Court on Monday upheld the death penalty a second time for 
"Freeway Killer" William George Bonin, affirming his conviction and sentence in 
the notorious beating and strangulation murders of 10 young males in Los 
Angeles County in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the justices affirmed a separate capital sentence that the 
42-year-old Bonin received for the killings of four teen-age boys whose nude 
bodies were dumped near roadways during the same period in Orange County. An 
appeal by Bonin to the U.S. Supreme Court in that case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
In a 6-1 ruling Monday, the court majority rejected claims that Bonin's 
convictions and sentence for the Los Angeles slayings should be set aside 
because of a potential conflict of interest between the defendant and his trial 
counsel, William T. Charvet of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Book-Rights Issue 
</P>
<P>
Bonin's lawyers on appeal had contended that the trial judge should have made a 
full inquiry to determine if there was a book-rights agreement between Bonin 
and Charvet that could have affected the attorney's strategy and tactics. 
Charvet had not responded directly to the question of an agreement when it was 
raised in court, but he told reporters outside the courtroom that no deal had 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal also had argued that Charvet faced another conflict because he had 
previously met with and considered defending James Munro, an accomplice in one 
of the murders who later became a key prosecution witness against Bonin. Munro 
pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, in an opinion by Justice Stanley Mosk, found that while trial 
judges must make inquiries about such possible conflicts, the failure to do so 
does not require the reversal of a conviction and sentence unless the defendant 
has shown that an actual conflict existed and that it had adversely affected 
his lawyer's performance. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William J. Keene was not 
presented with evidence that an agreement for Bonin's life story actually 
existed, and thus had no obligation to press an inquiry, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lack of Caution Cited 
</P>
<P>
Keene should have further investigated the potential conflict arising from 
Charvet's previous dealings with Munro, and the judge "plainly failed to act 
with the caution required in a capital proceeding," Mosk said. But there was no 
showing of an adverse impact on the defense of Bonin and thus Bonin's appeal 
must be turned down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At trial, Charvet had sharply cross-examined Munro for several days and made a 
"broad and deep" attack on Munro's credibility, Mosk said. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot find or even conjecture any failing on Charvet's part that could be 
attributed to any information he . . . could conceivably have received from 
Munro when they discussed the possibility of representation," Mosk wrote. In 
dissent, Justice Allen E. Broussard argued that Bonin's convictions and 
sentence should be set aside and the case sent back to the trial court for a 
full hearing on the potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I am well aware of the pain and horror that this defendant has inflicted on so 
many," Broussard wrote. "I too feel that his crimes were so shocking and 
heinous that it seems an outrage to question the lawfulness of the verdict in 
any way. Yet I am convinced that an impartial application of the law to the 
facts requires us to remand the matter to the trial court." 
</P>
<P>
The issue arose when Bonin, a one-time truck driver from Downey, sought before 
trial to substitute Charvet as his lawyer in place of Earl L. Hanson of Los 
Angeles, his court-appointed attorney. Asked why, Bonin replied, "Personal 
vibes." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Sterling E. Norris, 
objected, saying the substitution was a delaying tactic. Norris also raised the 
potential for conflict of interest by Charvet. 
</P>
<P>
The defense attorney denied that he had received any significant information 
from Munro and said that no formal lawyer-client relationship ever existed 
between them. Charvet said the prosecution had no right to question his fee 
arrangement with Bonin. Judge Keene at first refused to allow Charvet to 
substitute for Hanson, but he later relented, and Bonin was tried, convicted 
and sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
State Deputy Atty. Gen. Steven Zeigen welcomed Monday's ruling, saying that 
Bonin clearly expressed his desire to be represented by Charvet and that there 
was no indication that Bonin suffered any harm. 
</P>
<P>
"This case was so egregious and the evidence so irrefutable that it is very 
difficult to find any prejudice against Bonin," Zeigen said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonin's lawyer on appeal was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In another ruling Monday, the court held 6 to 1 that a drunk driver who kills 
one victim and injures others in the same accident can be punished for both 
vehicular manslaughter and felony drunk driving resulting in bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
The court, in an opinion by Justice Marcus M. Kaufman, rejected the contention 
that such "double punishment" was barred by a state law that, with certain 
exceptions, prohibits multiple punishments for a single act. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, Mosk contended that the defendant in the case, Donald Joseph 
McFarland Jr., had committed only a single criminal act -- driving while 
intoxicated -- and thus should not be punished under both the manslaughter and 
drunk-driving statutes. 
</P>
<P>
The case arose in 1986 when McFarland, while driving on a road in San Diego, 
slammed into a car stopped at an intersection, fatally injuring the driver, 
Steven Herbert, and seriously injuring Herbert's wife and son. McFarland, found 
to be driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.27%, was sentenced to prison for 
a total of eight years for vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and for 
causing injury while driving under the influence of alcohol.

HOME CARE STUDY AIMS AT SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several hundred elderly Santa Monica residents will receive physical exams and 
other health care at home under a pilot program conducted by the Santa Monica 
Senior Health and Peer Counseling Center and UCLA's Multicampus Division of 
Geriatric Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Under a $657,143 grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation of Battle Creek, 
Mich., to study the effects of in-home preventive health care on the elderly, 
researchers are contacting 2,700 Santa Monica residents who are age 75 or older 
to find at least 600 people willing to participate in the project, according to 
project director Harriet Aronow. Of those, 300 will be visited by nurses, 
interviewed and given physical examinations, and their progress will be 
monitored for at least two years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The other participants will be a comparison group for whom no services are 
provided. Dr. Laurence Rubenstein, one of the coordinators of the project, said 
similar studies in Europe have shown that in-home assessment and intervention 
lower the mortality rate, reduce the need for hospitalization and cut medical 
costs for senior citizens.

U.S. GROUP TO OPEN OFFICE IN ARMENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Armenian-American organization has been given permission to open an office 
in Yerevan, the capital of Soviet Armenia, to assist efforts in rebuilding 
parts of the region devastated in the December earthquake, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian Assembly of America was given approval to open the office when two 
of its members visited their stricken ancestral homeland in December, officials 
of the group said in a meeting carried to its members in New York, Boston and 
Los Angeles by satellite television. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 members of the assembly met in the Hollywood studios of KCET-TV on 
Monday to hear reports from officials who had visited the regions of Armenia 
hit hardest by the Dec. 7 quake that left about 50,000 dead and 500,000 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the first American organization to have a permanent office in Soviet 
Armenia," said Los Angeles attorney Raffi Hovannisian, an official who helped 
negotiate the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"An Armenian-American presence in Yerevan opens the door for long-range 
cooperation and assistance," Hirair Hovnanian, a New Jersey developer who 
chairs the assembly, said in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the assembly said their office, scheduled to open next month, will 
be active in arranging the exchange of technical teams that will assist 
Armenians with everything from sophisticated orthopedic surgery techniques to 
methods for constructing buildings better able to withstand severe earthquakes.

VASQUEZ AND STANTON TAKE OATHS OF OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven months after they both won election, Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and 
Roger R. Stanton were sworn into office Monday in a ceremony outside the 
county's Hall of Administration in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Both supervisors said their experience in office so far has taught them lessons 
about how to govern through some of the difficult decisions facing the county. 
</P>
<P>
The "challenges, while formidable and insurmountable to some, can and will be 
conquered," said Vasquez, who was appointed to his 3rd District seat in 1987 by 
Gov. George Deukmejian and became the county's first elected Latino supervisor 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that we . . . will face the adversities and the shortfalls and 
overcome them with solutions, leadership and, most of all, the motivation to 
build a future for the next generation and beyond," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton, who was first elected in 1980, is beginning his third term in the 1st 
District. "I accept this oath with more humility than I did in 1981," he said. 
"Quiet perseverance . . . that's the rule, not the exception for millions who 
are beyond the glare of public office." 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony featured a Marine Corps brass band from Camp Pendleton and remarks 
from state Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights) and the county's other three supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Stanton was sworn in by Bergeson and Vasquez was sworn in by California 
Associate Justice John Arguelles.

BECKMAN FOUNDATION GIVES CLINIC $1.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation of Corona del Mar has pledged $1.5 
million to a UC Irvine laser-research facility named in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
The $1.5 million will be used by the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic 
at UCI to attract additional research scientists, university officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This gift from the Beckman Foundation is particularly meaningful at this stage 
of development in laser research," said Dr. Michael Berns, professor of surgery 
and director of the institute. 
</P>
<P>
"Laser bio-technology is developing through an integrated approach to 
problem-solving that calls for physicians, biologists, engineers, physicists, 
chemists and other specialists to work together to solve common problems in the 
field. This gift will allow us to recruit key people." 
</P>
<P>
The institute, established at UCI in 1982, has pioneered laser detection and 
treatment of cancers, reshaping of the cornea of eyes and destruction of stones 
in the ureter and gallbladder. The facility is considered unique in the nation 
in that it combines laser research and clinical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
University officials said the $1.5-million pledge by the Beckman Foundation 
brings the total amount of private funds raised for the institute to about $15 
million.

EX-BUS DRIVER GETS PROBATION FOR THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former RTD driver convicted of stealing $2,700 in parts from the transit 
district for use in his private bus was placed on three years probation Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Albert Matthews also ordered Vernon Holloway, 
47, of Pasadena to perform 200 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway, who drove buses for the Southern California Rapid Transit District 
for 11 years, was convicted in November of two counts of receiving stolen 
property and one count of conspiracy to receive stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Holloway's co-defendant, former RTD maintenance supervisor Franklin C. Jack, 
has been a fugitive since June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office said Jack helped Holloway steal a $700 air 
conditioning compressor from a district maintenance yard in Glendale in April, 
1986. Prosecutors said the two men also stole about $2,000 worth of mechanical 
parts from the yard.

BABY SITTER GETS 8 YEARS IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Canyon Country baby sitter convicted of involuntary manslaughter for shaking 
a 6-month-old baby to death was sentenced Monday to eight years and eight 
months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Vickie Maas, 28, cried as San Fernando Superior Court Judge Howard J. Schwab 
announced the sentence, the maximum allowable for the charge. 
</P>
<P>
"In all my years as a judge this is the most aggravated case of amorality that 
I have ever seen," Schwab said. "This case will haunt me for the rest of my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Maas was arrested after the death of David Allen Duncan, on Jan. 8, 1988. Maas 
testified that she "gently" shook the child two days earlier when she panicked 
because he would not stop crying. The boy died from swelling in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
Mass also was convicted of three counts of felony child abuse for mistreatment 
of the Duncan infant and two others who suffered a bruised ear and broken leg 
in 1987.

HANDYMAN ADMITS STARTING FOREST FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A handyman pleaded guilty Monday to setting two fires that blackened more than 
12,800 acres of the San Bernardino National Forest and caused more than $2 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
James Lonczak, 41, of Covina pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles to two counts of arson in the public domain. Lonczak admitted starting 
the fire last Sept. 28 in the Texas Hills north of Rancho Cucamonga, about 40 
miles east of downtown Los Angeles, that burned 12,800 acres, two homes and 
several automobiles. He also admitted starting a blaze nearby last Aug. 27 that 
burned about 35 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam Schiff said Lonczak is also suspected of setting 22 
other fires that burned about 250 acres last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Lonczak told U.S. District Judge John Davies that he drove to the area and 
"threw out a cigarette with a match taped to it alongside the road, which 
ignited the brush." 
</P>
<P>
Lonczak, a handyman and carpenter for World Vision, a Monrovia-based 
philanthropic organization, faces a maximum of 10 years in prison, a $500,000 
fine and $2.1 million in restitution when he is sentenced Feb. 27.

<TEXT>
<P>
The new main branch of the Los Angeles Division of the U.S. Postal Service 
opened Monday in part of a $151-million postal complex that will be fully 
operational in mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
The new branch, known as Main Office Station, replaces the Florence branch,

SALUTING THE HEROES; 
</P>
<P>
DEPUTIES HONORED FOR RISKING THEIR LIVES TRYING TO SAVE OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM OVEREND, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sheriff's Deputies Tim Parker and Gean Okada risked their lives trying to save 
two small children from a burning house in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Ronald Gilbert and four other sheriff's officers pulled two men from a 
burning van 15 seconds before the vehicle exploded. 
</P>
<P>
And Deputy Hagop Kuredjian saved the life of a Malibu woman who was hanging 
from a tree branch on a hillside over the Pacific Coast Highway on the Fourth 
of July. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ceremony Held 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, in a ceremony observed by 108 members of the latest graduating class 
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, those officers were honored as 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing the officers at a ceremony at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
Sheriff Sherman Block kept his remarks brief. 
</P>
<P>
"Far too much attention is given to the anti-heroes," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
With that, Block presented the department's highest award for heroism, the 
Medal of Valor, to Parker for his actions in May, 1988, when he tried 
unsuccessfully to save the lives of two children trapped in a burning house. 
</P>
<P>
Parker and Okada, who was awarded a Silver Meritorious Conduct Medal, arrived 
at the house just before midnight and were told that children were trapped 
inside. Parker braved the flames repeatedly in an effort to find them, 
suffering second-degree burns on his arm and hand. Okada fought the fire from 
outside the house. 
</P>
<P>
One child died of smoke inhalation during the fire, and the other died 10 days 
later. After receiving his award Monday, Parker said he still thinks of the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to deal with it (their deaths)," he said. "You do the best job 
you can and hope that it will produce the results you want." 
</P>
<P>
Also awarded the Medal of Valor were Deputy Gilbert and former Deputy Lewis 
Hicks, who resigned from the department last week. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert and Hicks were two of five officers who came across a fiery traffic 
accident in Lynwood last May, involving a van that had crashed into a bus 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting off choking smoke and flames, Hicks and Gilbert dragged one passenger 
out of the van, while officers Hilbrand Goedhart and David Sauer rescued the 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
Goedhart, Sauer and Deputy Allyn Martin, who had launched the rescue operation 
while off-duty, were honored Monday with Gold Meritorious Conduct Medals. 
</P>
<P>
Also receiving a Gold Meritorious Conduct award was Kuredjian, who rescued a 
Malibu woman last July 4 after she almost fell to her death while watching a 
fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
Kuredjian responded to a 911 call after the woman had fallen down a steep 
incline over Pacific Coast Highway and found her hanging from a tree branch 150 
feet over the highway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pulled to Safety 
</P>
<P>
Kuredjian could not pull her up with his arms, so he made his way below the 
woman and coaxed her into dropping 5 feet, where he caught her and pulled her 
to safety. 
</P>
<P>
A Silver Meritorious Conduct Medal was also awarded to Deputy Richard Wright 
for his efforts to rescue the occupants of a burning car in Riverside County in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Wright and a paramedic managed to drag one of four passengers from the burning 
car, but the passenger later died. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the bravery of the officers at the ceremony was state Supreme 
Court Justice Malcolm Lucas, who noted that "some of the most successful police 
work" never requires taking a gun from a holster. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowing a line from the "Hill Street Blues," TV series, Lucas advised his 
audience: "Let's be careful out there."

POSTSCRIPT: 'WHEN IT COMES TO MY OWN BODY, I BELIEVE I HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO 
WITH IT WHAT I WANT.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Now that she is out of prison, Norma Jean Almodovar does not sound as though 
she means to sit in her Vermont Avenue-area apartment and shut up. 
</P>
<P>
It's just that under the terms of her parole, she can't practice her chosen 
profession again -- something she regrets because "it was a wonderful job for 
me. I loved it." 
</P>
<P>
Almodovar is the former civilian Los Angeles Police Department traffic control 
officer who turned prostitute and let everybody know she was writing a book, 
"From Cop to Callgirl," that told a lot of things about her police colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before she was arrested on a pandering charge. The police said 
she offered to arrange a paid date for another woman traffic control officer. 
Almodovar insisted that she was set up. In September of 1984, a jury convicted 
her. 
</P>
<P>
Under California law, that meant a mandatory three-year prison term. Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Aurelio Munoz, however, considered it unduly harsh 
punishment and granted her three years' probation -- a bit of generosity that 
the district attorney's office successfully appealed to the state Court of 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
So early last year, Munoz reluctantly dispatched Almodovar to the California 
Institution for Women at Frontera, where she stayed until August, when she was 
transferred to a downtown Los Angeles halfway house and allowed to work as a 
filing clerk at the gas company. 
</P>
<P>
Now back in the apartment where she lives with unemployed actor-architect 
Victor Savant, whom she married the night before she went to prison, Almodovar 
remains determined to find a publisher for her book. She says the police seized 
the manuscript as evidence when they busted her and she never got it back, but 
she has rewritten it. 
</P>
<P>
She also wants to write a book about "what really goes on in prison" and to run 
for national office on the Libertarian Party ticket in order to circulate the 
message that the government harasses people who speak out. (You may recall that 
she lost her Libertarian bid for lieutenant governor in 1986.) 
</P>
<P>
She also writes a little poetry ("Poems by a Whore," for instance), which she 
recites with scarcely any prompting. 
</P>
<P>
She says she will try to make a living turning out ceramic dolls, just one of 
her several skills -- the one they allowed her to teach to other inmates in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
And, she says, she would also like to lecture and give as many interviews as 
her parole officer will allow. "I just hope it will keep me in the public eye," 
she said. "I hope it will keep people remembering who I am until I get my book 
published." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Almodovar stays pretty close to her apartment. The judge made 
it clear to her that her call girl nights are over. On the walls are several of 
her oil paintings, as well as several by Savant. There are also a couple of 
bumper stickers pasted up. One of them urges you to SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL HOOKER. 
On the coffee table are several art books -- including "Walt Disney Art" and 
"Great Bordellos of the World." 
</P>
<P>
She pushes her long hair (colored "cherry cola," she says) back from her black 
jersey pullover and says unhappily: "I believe in obeying the laws that violate 
other people's rights. But when it comes to my own body, I believe I have the 
right to do with it what I want. Apparently I was wrong about that." JACK JONES

VICTIM OF CAVE-IN WINS SETTLEMENT: $6 MILLION INCLUDING COMPENSATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SPANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A union carpenter who was left a quadriplegic after the dirt walls of a pit 
collapsed on him in Irvine has won a $4.8-million settlement of his legal 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ursulich, 38, of Santa Ana should also receive $1.2 million in workers 
compensation payments, making his expected $6-million take one of the largest 
individual recoveries in years in county courts. 
</P>
<P>
"He was scared to death about how he could take care of himself for the rest of 
his life," said Robert G. Skinner of Orange, Ursulich's attorney. "Now he won't 
have to worry about finances." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the settlement, $3.5 million, will be paid by insurers for Robert 
A. Alleborn Associates, a developer, under an agreement reached Friday before 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Jerold Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
When the cave-in happened on Sept. 10, 1985, Ursulich was working for the 
general contractor on the project, Equidon Construction Co., which has since 
gone out of business, according to Skinner. 
</P>
<P>
Ursulich, who could not be reached for comment, is confined to a wheelchair. He 
can write only with aid from a special device that compensates for his 
inability to use his fingers completely. He lives with his wife, whom he 
married 3 months after the accident, in a Santa Ana home specially remodeled to 
accommodate his disability. 
</P>
<P>
In the lawsuit, Ursulich alleged that his supervisors were careless at the 
construction site for Irvine Corporate Plaza at Main Street and Jamboree Road. 
</P>
<P>
The walls of the pit had given way twice before, but Ursulich alleged that he 
was not told about the earlier problems when he entered the excavation on 
instructions from his boss, Skinner said. 
</P>
<P>
In the settlement, Alleborn acknowledged no liability. Alleborn's attorney, 
Michael J. McHale, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
The hole, 20 feet across and 18 feet deep, had not been shored. Ursulich went 
into the pit to lay out pipe to be connected to a water tank. He was struck on 
the back by a rock during the cave-in, causing his injuries. He was also buried 
up to his neck and could barely breathe because of the weight of the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
Ursulich was saved because a backhoe, by coincidence, had been left in the pit 
after the last collapse, Skinner said. An operator quickly activated the 
backhoe and dug the victim out within 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Two other subcontractors contributed a total of $675,000 to the settlement. 
Ursulich has already collected $600,000 in medical benefits and lost wages from 
workers compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Ursulich was hospitalized for 6 months after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
"He went through a lot of rough times at first," Skinner said. "He had a lot of 
problems with housing. But he's a great guy, and he has a wonderful attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Before the accident, Ursulich played football in high school and was an active 
outdoorsman. Today, "he watches a lot of television," Skinner said.

BANDITS TAKE $100,000 IN MALL JEWELRY HEIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four bandits who held customers and workers at gunpoint in a Buena Park Mall 
jewelry store Monday morning fled with about $100,000 in merchandise, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the robbery was similar to other recent Southland "smash-and-rob" 
holdups, in which gunmen shatter display cases and escape with jewelry in a 
matter of moments, fleeing the area in a stolen car that is quickly abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Buena Park Police Lt. Tony Kelly said the four entered Ashley's Jewelry Store 
about 10:20 a.m. One of the bandits trained a gun on employees and three 
customers while another smashed glass display cases and the other two scooped 
out jewelry. Then they ran out of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
People who apparently watched the holdup from a nearby mall restaurant 
telephoned police, who fanned out at mall exits but missed the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly said the robbers fled in a car that proved later to be stolen. It was 
abandoned a short time later near the residential intersection of Magnolia and 
Greenleaf avenues in Anaheim, which is near the Santa Ana and Riverside 
freeways.

COVINA MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO SETTING FOREST FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Covina man pleaded guilty in Los Angeles federal court Monday to setting two 
fires that destroyed more than 12,800 acres of the San Bernardino National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
James Lonczak, a carpenter and handyman for the Monrovia-based international 
relief organization World Vision, admitted throwing lighted cigarettes attached 
to matches into the brush near Lytle Creek on at least two occasions last year. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors have said a total of 24 fires were set under similar 
circumstances during a three-month period last summer. 
</P>
<P>
In one case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Adam B. Schiff said, Lonczak was photographed 
by U.S. Forest Service video cameras driving into and leaving the area near a 
35-acre blaze on Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Lonczak also has admitted touching off a brush fire in the Texas Hills region 
north of Rancho Cucamonga that eventually burned 12,800 acres and destroyed a 
home, several garages and cars. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement to U.S. District Judge John G. Davies, Lonczak said he drove 
about half a mile into Lytle Creek Canyon on Aug. 27, made a U-turn, then threw 
out a burning cigarette with a match attached to it. Lonczak said he started 
the Sept. 28 Texas Hills blaze in a similar manner. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Lindsay Weston refused to comment on why Lonczak started the 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
Lonczak faces up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine when he is sentenced 
Feb. 27. He also could be liable for restitution to cover the government's 
estimated $2.1 million in firefighting and reseeding costs.

HIGH COURT AGAIN OKS BONIN'S DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The state Supreme Court on Monday upheld the death penalty a second time for 
"Freeway Killer" William George Bonin, affirming his conviction and sentence in 
the notorious beating and strangulation murders of 10 young males in Los 
Angeles County in 1979 and 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, the justices affirmed a separate capital sentence that the 
42-year-old Bonin received for the killings of four teen-age boys whose nude 
bodies were dumped near roadways during the same period in Orange County. An 
appeal by Bonin to the U.S. Supreme Court in that case is pending. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan F. Brown, who prosecuted Bonin in the 
1983 Orange County case, said of the high court's action: "That's good news. It 
kind of looks like Mr. Bonin is going to end up in the gas chamber, doesn't 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
The lawyer who will handle Bonin's appeal was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In a 6-1 ruling Monday, the court majority rejected claims that Bonin's 
convictions and sentence for the Los Angeles slayings should be set aside 
because of a potential conflict of interest between the defendant and his trial 
counsel, William T. Charvet of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
Bonin's lawyers on appeal had contended that the trial judge should have made a 
full inquiry to determine if there was a book-rights agreement between Bonin 
and Charvet that could have affected the attorney's strategy and tactics. 
Charvet had not responded directly to the question of an agreement when it was 
raised in court, but he told reporters outside the courtroom that no deal had 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal also had argued that Charvet faced another conflict because he had 
previously met with and considered defending James Munro, an accomplice in one 
of the murders who later became a key prosecution witness against Bonin. Munro 
pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 15 years to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
The high court, in an opinion by Justice Stanley Mosk, found that while trial 
judges must make inquiries about such possible conflicts, the failure to do so 
does not require the reversal of a conviction and sentence unless the defendant 
has shown that an actual conflict existed and that it had adversely affected 
his lawyer's performance. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William J. Keene was not 
presented with evidence that an agreement for Bonin's life story actually 
existed, and thus had no obligation to press an inquiry, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Keene should have further investigated the potential conflict arising from 
Charvet's previous dealings with Munro, and the judge "plainly failed to act 
with the caution required in a capital proceeding," Mosk said. But there was no 
showing of an adverse impact on the defense of Bonin and thus Bonin's appeal 
must be turned down, the justice declared. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot find or even conjecture any failing on Charvet's part that could be 
attributed to any information he . . . could conceivably have received from 
Munro when they discussed the possibility of representation," Mosk wrote. In 
dissent, Justice Allen E. Broussard argued that Bonin's convictions and 
sentence should be set aside and the case sent back to the trial court for a 
full hearing on the potential conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I am well aware of the pain and horror that this defendant has inflicted on so 
many," Broussard wrote. "I, too, feel that his crimes were so shocking and 
heinous that it seems an outrage to question the lawfulness of the verdict in 
any way. Yet I am convinced that an impartial application of the law to the 
facts requires us to remand the matter to the trial court."

CLAIMS WORKER GETS 6 YEARS FOR STEALING $496,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A medical claims processor who diverted $496,000 to his own use to win back his 
estranged wife was sentenced Monday in Los Angeles federal court to six years 
in prison and ordered to undergo psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Harrelson, 26, who aroused the suspicion of fellow Cigna Corp. employees 
when he showed up for the company softball team's practice driving a new BMW 
car, said he had begun funneling the money into a secret bank account to lure 
back his wife's affections and then could not stop. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was a phone call from Harrelson's wife after his disappearance 
last August that sent authorities to Honolulu, where the claims processor led 
U.S. Postal Service inspectors on a chase through city streets before 
surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
"The wife turned the defendant in of her own volition. She was scared of him," 
Assistant U.S. Atty. David Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
Harrelson had claimed to be a member of the 1984 Spanish Olympic basketball 
team when he first went to work at Cigna's Northridge claims center in early 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, however, he began processing claims to a fictitious company he had set up 
with a post office box address. The fraudulent claims eventually totaled more 
than $453,000 and another $43,000 in checks were taken from the Cigna mail 
room, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife Took Everything 
</P>
<P>
Within a few months, Harrelson bought a BMW, a Cadillac Eldorado and a Honda 
Accord, $2,400 worth of jewelry, $35,000 in paintings and made a down payment 
on a new house in Chatsworth, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
Once he started diverting the money, defense attorney Alan Lanspaugh said, "It 
became almost like an addiction. He kept punching out those checks, because it 
was so easy." 
</P>
<P>
Lanspaugh said that although Harrelson fled to Hawaii, he was planning to turn 
himself in once he sold the BMW to raise money to hire a lawyer. The attorney 
denied that Harrelson's wife had ever been afraid of his client, but said she 
has since admitted that she made her original statements to postal inspectors 
because she feared criminal liability herself. 
</P>
<P>
But Katz said Harrelson's wife has also said he was planning not to turn 
himself in, but to adopt a new identity, go to work for another insurance 
company and launch the same scheme again. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not willing to work hard to get the finer things in life," the prosecutor 
said. "He wants to live a life that is way beyond his means and ability. . . . 
And he does it as a thief and a crook." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Pamela Ann Rymer granted Harrelson's request to undergo 
psychological counseling while in custody and also ordered him to pay $345,977 
in restitution to Cigna Corp.

OUTSIDE MOVE HELPS PUT POLISH ON ERKENBRACK'S GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
For 3 years, 5-foot 11-inch, 140-pound Keri Erkenbrack of Canyon High School 
posted up near the paint, her little elbows ready to do battle with the biggest 
of Orange County's centers. 
</P>
<P>
But this season, Canyon Coach Bill Fitzgibbons moved her to forward, and 
Erkenbrack is beginning to shine after 3 years of being the diamond that was 
roughed up. 
</P>
<P>
Erkenbrack, The Times' athlete of the week, scored a career-high 31 points and 
pulled down 10 rebounds in a 63-37 victory over El Modena Thursday in the 
Century League opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Two days earlier, she scored 25 points in Canyon's 70-24 nonleague victory over 
Troy. 
</P>
<P>
Erkenbrack leads her team in scoring with 20.3 points per game and rebounding 
(10.4). She also has been the soccer team's starting goalie for 3 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Playing center, Erkenbrack was used to taking a lot of shots -- inside. She had 
to be persuaded to shoot from the perimeter when she was moved to forward 
during summer-league play, Fitzgibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
But after working over the summer at practice and in the La Mirada High School 
summer league, Erkenbrack is comfortable with 20-foot shots and is the team's 
leading 3-point shooter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big transition," Erkenbrack said. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside, I'm only 5-11 and I'm used to getting killed underneath. I have to 
really fight for position. Outside, I have an advantage with my height. And 
having experience playing inside, I can always drive to the basket or post up." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzgibbons acknowledges that Erkenbrack's scoring average could soar in a 
program with less of a team focus. 
</P>
<P>
Two other starters average about 9 points per game -- point guard Christa 
Ramirez and 6-3 center Sheri Rhyne, whose arrival has freed Erkenbrack to roam 
the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
"Keri is not the focal point," Fitzgibbons said. "Her main objective is to play 
good defense and hit the boards. She doesn't have to lead our team." 
</P>
<P>
TOP PERFORMER

CAMPBELL'S 53 POINTS CARRY LA QUINTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Campbell scored a school-record 53 points to lead La Quinta High School 
to a 92-63 victory over Bolsa Grande Monday in a Garden Grove League boys' 
basketball game at La Quinta. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell broke John Rogers' school record of 52 set in 1981 and tied the fourth 
highest single-game performance in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Gergen of Rancho Alamitos (1966), Tom Lewis of Mater Dei (1983) and Mike 
Goff of Magnolia (1987) also scored 53 points in a game. Arthur Worthy of 
Huntington Beach holds the county record of 58 points, set in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
"At halftime I thought I had 18 or 20 points, just a regular game for me," said 
Campbell, a 6-foot 5-inch senior forward. "Then someone told me I had 35 and I 
started thinking that Johnny's record was only 52. So I kept shooting and the 
ball kept going in." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell made 17 of 29 shots, including 8 of 9 3-pointers. He left the game 
with more than 5 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
It was Campbell's seventh consecutive game in which he has scored at least 30 
points. He is averaging 34.6 points per game this season, tops in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"Things have been going well lately," Campbell said. "I have to give the credit 
to my point guards. They've been getting me the ball in good position to 
score." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Snyder added 13 points and 12 assists for La Quinta. 
</P>

La Quinta (8-4 overall, 3-0 in league) led, 27-17, at the end of the first

OCC'S CRANE SHOWING ALL THE RIGHT MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Kresal 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dareck Crane made a couple of moves, one off the court and one on, that have 
increased his basketball fortunes greatly this season. 
</P>
<P>
Crane, a 6-foot 3-inch sophomore at Orange Coast College, moved from off guard 
to point guard a few games into the season. He also moved from Compton, where 
he grew up, to Costa Mesa to be closer to school. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it would be asking a lot of him," OCC Coach Tandy Gillis said about 
Crane's move to point guard. "But he's doing a lot. A lot of people say he can 
play anywhere. He's that type of player. He works hard to learn things." 
</P>
<P>
Crane has helped lead OCC to a 16-4 overall record and a 1-0 mark in Orange 
Empire Conference play. He is averaging a team-high 16.6 points and 4.4 
rebounds a game and has a team-high 35 steals. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I was uncomfortable," Crane said. "I was used to catching the ball 
and shooting it. Now, I have to know where everybody is on the floor. I was 
also afraid it would hurt my offense, but coach told me that he wants me to 
still shoot the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Crane was a 3-year varsity player at Compton High School, where he averaged 19 
points a game as a senior forward in 1987. But when he went looking for a 
college, none were looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
Crane heard about OCC from Ron Calhoun, Compton's freshman basketball coach. 
Calhoun played at OCC in 1979-80, and he suggested Crane call Gillis. 
</P>
<P>
"Ron (Calhoun) knows the game," Gillis said. "And if he says someone can play, 
then they can." 
</P>
<P>
Crane and Orange Coast's LaMont Speed, who also were high school teammates, 
traveled 80 miles from Compton to OCC and back each day last school year. The 
long commute caused them to miss classes and even the team bus for a few games, 
according to Crane. 
</P>
<P>
The two moved into an apartment near campus this fall with the help of 
part-time campus jobs and financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
Crane struggled in class last year with a C average, but this year he is close 
to a B average. 
</P>
<P>
"It (the commute) resulted in a lot of illness and other problems," Crane said. 
"Moving close to school has really helped out a lot. Things are going a lot 
better this year." 
</P>
<P>
On the line. When Cypress (8-10 overall and 1-1 in conference play) is at 
Fullerton Wednesday in a men's basketball game, the 7:30 p.m. matchup will 
feature the best and worst free-throw shooting teams in the Orange Empire 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Donnelly, a freshman forward from Katella High School, has made 95% (35 of 
37) of his free throws to lead Cypress, which is shooting 74% (252 of 339) as a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Donnelly set a Cypress record by making 26 in a row earlier this season. He 
missed 2 in a row but has made 9 consecutive since. 
</P>
<P>
The free-throw line is one of the few places where Fullerton (16-3, 1-0) has 
struggled. The Hornets are shooting 61% (339 of 554). 
</P>
<P>
Riverside (16-8, 1-1) travels to Rancho Santiago (11-7, 1-1), and Saddleback 
(8-10, 1-0) is at Orange Coast (16-4, 1-0) in other Wednesday games. Golden 
West (15-5, 0-2) has the night off. 
</P>
<P>
Markus Muller-Stach has moved into a tie for fourth on the Golden West men's 
basketball all-time scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
Muller-Stach, a sophomore forward from Corona del Mar High School, has scored 
1,033 points in a little more than a season and a half and is tied with Jim 
Anderson (1972-74). Chris Thompson (1969-71) leads with 1,441 points. 
Muller-Stach averaged 18 points last season and is averaging 23.5 points this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Community College Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gari Calhoun, an all-Mission Conference linebacker and honorable mention 
All-American for OCC last fall, has signed a letter of intent to play at 
Clemson next season. Calhoun, who attended high school in Atlanta, had 99 
tackles, including 6 sacks, this season. Mike Miscione, a running back from 
Rancho Santiago, has signed with Cal State Long Beach. Miscione, from Esperanza 
High School, ran for 1,139 yards and 11 touchdowns this season. Sean Turner, an 
OCC defensive back from Corona del Mar High School, and Robbie Glover, a Rancho 
Santiago defensive back from Orange High School, have signed with Ball State. 
Ken Griggs, a wide receiver for OCC, has signed with California. Griggs, from 
Edison High School, had 22 catches for 274 yards and a touchdown this season.

Because inaccurate information was supplied to The Times Orange County Edition, 
a story and table in Tuesday's Business section contained incorrect figures for 
average fourth-quarter office rents in Orange County as calculated by Grubb

$2.60 per square foot per month; south county, $1.25 to $1.85; central county, 
$1.05 to $2.15; north county, $1 to $2; and west county, $1.25 to $2.25.

GENERAL AUTOMATION WILL GET BOOST FROM SANDERSON ELECTRONICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
General Automation, a struggling Anaheim computer maker, said Monday that it 
has reached a definitive agreement with Sanderson Electronics PLC in England to 
obtain a financial infusion of up to $4.1 million 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, General Automation has restructured its top management and 
plans to lay off about 65 of its approximately 390 employees. About a dozen 
employees based in Orange County will be included in the work force reduction. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sanderson gave General Automation the first $500,000 of a 
$1.75-million loan and will provide the rest by Jan. 23, a spokesman said. The 
loan funds will be used to shore up General Automation's computer manufacturing 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
General Automation has been losing money for more than a year. It posted an 
$11-million loss for the fiscal year ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
But the company's new chief executive was upbeat, attributing losses to past 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Blood 
</P>
<P>
"This is exactly what the company needed -- a shot of fresh blood," said 
Leonard Mackenzie, General Automation's vice chairman and newly installed chief 
executive. "This is a very good deal for our customers, our employees, our 
shareholders -- everybody." 
</P>
<P>
The losses have not eroded customer service, he said, and the firm expects 
sales to rise. The company also has reduced its worldwide operating expenses by 
$2 million a year as part of a cost-cutting plan, Mackenzie said. In addition, 
the company is negotiating to sell non-essential operations, which were not 
specified. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock, he said, will continue to be traded on the American Stock 
Exchange, where it closed Monday at 50 cents a share, down 6.25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative deal with Sanderson was hammered out 2 weeks ago, capping a series 
of merger discussions with several potential suitors. An unspecified number of 
interested companies never got beyond the initial talking stages, said Joseph 
Allen, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In order to accept Sanderson's offer, General Automation had to spurn a merger 
bid by Alpha Microsystems in Santa Ana. Earlier in the fall, General Automation 
executives were talking with WesPac Technologies in Irvine about a possible 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compatible Businesses 
</P>
<P>
Mackenzie said company executives liked the fact that Sanderson's business is 
compatible with General Automation's. Like the Anaheim firm, the British firm 
specializes in the Pick operating system, a software program that controls a 
computer's basic functions. 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson is less than a third the size of General Automation. In U.S. dollars, 
it earned $1.3 million on sales of $15 million last year, Mackenzie said. 
General Automation's revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30 was $50.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the dozen layoffs expected in Orange County, the firm will cut about 40 
employees from its operations in England, where General Automation is 
consolidating two plants into a Birmingham facility it acquired last year when 
it bought Aston Technology Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the layoffs will come from operations elsewhere in the United 
States, primarily Dallas and New Jersey, Allen said. The layoffs are in 
addition to about 50 positions trimmed through attrition since June, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Sanderson will be able to convert its $1.75-million loan into 
2.5 million shares of newly issued common stock in General Automation. In 
addition, Sanderson will receive about 200,000 shares in lieu of loan fees. 
</P>
<P>
The British firm also will get warrants that will allow it to purchase up to 
2.9 million additional shares of newly issued General Automation stock at 70 
cents a share by midsummer. If the warrants are exercised, the proceeds will be 
used for working capital, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
If Sanderson converts the loan and exercises its warrants, it will wind up with 
5.6 million General Automation shares, or a controlling interest of 51%. Even 
so, Mackenzie said General Automation expects to remain autonomous. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanderson is looking at this as an investment," Mackenzie said. "The company 
will still operate as General Automation." 
</P>
<P>
Sanderson, however, has appointed three of its executives to General 
Automation's six-member board. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Paul Thompson, 36, is the Anaheim company's new chairman. He 
replaces Alexander W. Giles Jr., who was named chairman in a restructuring in 
August. Giles will remain on the board as one of three board members from 
General Automation. 
</P>
<P>
Mackenzie, who had been chairman for 8 years until the August restructuring, 
became chief executive, replacing W. Norris Agee, who resigned as president, 
chief executive and director after 5 months on the job. Mackenzie has 
previously held the posts of president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Two other directors, lawyers William Lucas and John C. Conlan, also resigned to 
make room for Sanderson directors. 
</P>
<P>
General Automation also named Douglas C. Tullio as president of its North 
American operations. Together with presidents of Pacific Rim and European 
operations, he will report to Mackenzie. The office of president is being 
eliminated, Mackenzie said.

The Hammond Co. has come up with what it believes to be a unique loan for home 
buyers -- an adjustable-rate mortgage that does not require payments for 3 
months. 
</P>
<P>
The loan is designed to help families meet the extraordinary costs of moving 
into a home and making improvements, said Thomas T. Hammond, chairman and 
president of the Newport Beach firm. 
</P>
<P>
The loan, introduced Thursday, would enable some borrowers to use their savings 
to buy new furniture, appliances or other necessities for the home before the 
mortgage payments begin, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, borrowers will eventually pay for the 3-month hiatus in payments. 
The amount owed is tacked on as principal, and the entire loan is repaid in 29 
years, 9 months. The total repayment would be higher than if the loan were paid 
out normally over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
But borrowers could be better off in the short run with the feature than 
without it, said Michael Franklin, Hammond's executive vice president for loan 
originations. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming a loan of $100,000 under current interest rates, total payments would 
average $695 a month over the first year, while payments would average $801 a 
month with a typical adjustable-rate loan, Franklin said. The $106-a-month 
savings is realized by dividing nine payments by 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $1,270 that would be saved in the first year would be added to 
the principal, creating a loan of $101,270. The general rule of thumb that 
borrowers eventually pay three times the loan amount means that a $1,270 
savings now will cost $3,810 over the life of the loan.

NATIONAL BANK OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NAMES EXECUTIVE VP AS NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James S. Granelli, Times staff writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mark H. Stuenkel has been named president of National Bank of Southern 
California, a Santa Ana bank that saw its assets increase nearly 45% in the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Stuenkel, who was the bank's executive vice president, took over a position 
relinquished by William H. Jacoby, who remains as the bank's chairman and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been expanding rapidly, and we're continuing to expand," Jacoby said. 
"So we needed to broaden the management base. It was nice to have a guy who has 
been with us since we opened in 1982 ready to take over." 
</P>
<P>
Stuenkel, who had been promoted through the ranks, will continue with some of 
his most recent duties. His position as executive vice president was 
eliminated, Jacoby said. 
</P>
<P>
Stuenkel of Diamond Bar had worked at Security Pacific National Bank for 8 
years before joining National Bank of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The new executive post will free Jacoby to spend more time on policy matters 
and growth plans, including future acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank acquired Pacific Regency Bank in El Toro, which had 
exhausted its capital after constant losses over its 4-year existence. 
</P>
<P>
Jacoby said National Bank ended the year with nearly $200 million in assets; it 
had $137.2 million in assets a year earlier.

THE WONDER OF ELVIS: ENDEARING BIRTHDAY BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Times Pop Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On one level, the second annual Elvis Presley birthday benefit at the Music 
Machine on Sunday night was just a good excuse to have a party. 
</P>
<P>
And the evening worked just fine on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen local musicians -- from country star Dwight Yoakam to rock hero Dave 
Alvin -- took turns singing nearly four dozen Presley-related songs (including 
two novelties about him) during a wonderfully engaging 3 1/2-hour concert. 
</P>
<P>
The benefit -- which raised about $3,000 for the Los Angeles Free Clinic -- was 
a remarkably tender and tasteful tribute to rock's greatest star, who would 
have been 54 Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It was an informal and upbeat event with no traces of the tacky or maudlin 
extremism sometimes generated by Presley's most obsessed fans. In just two 
years, the affair has established itself as one of the most endearing nights on 
the L.A. music calendar. 
</P>
<P>
But there was something more than just music going on in the club. On a deeper 
and more subtle level, the musicians were celebrating their own musical dreams 
-- dreams that in many cases were ignited by Presley: the idea that it is 
possible to rise from the humblest of beginnings and to fulfill your greatest 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
As the musicians stepped to the microphone for two to three numbers each, they 
represented various levels of success. Some (notably Yoakam) have become the 
star they dreamed about, while others (the Stray Cats, represented by drummer 
Slim Jim Phantom and bassist Lee Rocker) have achieved stardom only to see it 
fade and now are on the comeback trail. 
</P>
<P>
There were others (especially Dave Alvin, formerly of the Blasters) who have 
done outstanding work, yet have not achieved equivalent commercial acceptance. 
And there were many others on the stage who must have realized their chances of 
fulfilling their dreams are pretty much past, but who continue to make music 
simply for the love of it. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how tattered the dream, there must have been a moment on stage Sunday 
when the dream was reborn, when the celebration of the Presley music and the 
warmth of the applause made everything seem possible once more. 
</P>
<P>
No scene better summarized that tone than when singer and benefit co-host James 
Intveld was joined on stage by his father, Fred, who sang two Elvis songs 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Intveld, who wore a Presley T-shirt, is a retired machine operator who so 
loved Elvis as a teen-ager in Holland that he sang in a weekend rock band, 
though he never was able to pursue it professionally. 
</P>
<P>
After finishing the songs, Intveld gave his son a hug and sat at a table where, 
later, he watched with pride as James Intveld went through some Presley 
material himself. 
</P>
<P>
Like his brother, Rick (a musician who was killed in a 1986 plane crash with 
Rick Nelson, after whom he was named), James Intveld, 29, was virtually raised 
on rock. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most appealing singers on the local scene for years, James Intveld, 
ironically, sings the jingle on the Oldsmobile commercial that features 
Presley's widow, Priscilla, and daughter Lisa Marie. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like seeing myself (40 years ago)," the elder Intveld said, watching his 
son. "It's what I wanted to do, but I just never had the opportunity . . . 
things just never worked out." 
</P>
<P>
James Intveld, who co-produced the benefit with Art Fein (host of the 
public-access cable-TV show, "Li'l Art's Poker Party"), said he thought a live 
show would be a good way to celebrate Presley's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Art used to play Elvis records at Club Lingerie on Elvis' birthday and I 
thought it made sense for us to get together and do a real show," he said. 
"Everyone I called (among musicians) seemed up for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There was something about Elvis and his music that touched so many people. He 
was certainly my biggest influence, after my dad. You say the name Elvis to 
anyone and they know who he was. . . . He was someone who made so many people 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
After raising $1,500 last year, Intveld and Fein moved it to the larger Music 
Machine, where a near-capacity crowd was already on hand when the music began 
shortly before 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a six-piece band led by Intveld, the performers delved into all areas 
of Presley's catalogue, from the early Sun Records tunes to the big hits to a 
few obscurities. The artists ranged from rockabilly advocates Ray Campi and 
Ronnie Mack to blues-minded showmen King Cotten and Jimmy Woods, from county 
singers Rosie Flores and Chris Gaffney to art-conscious pop stylist Syd Straw. 
</P>
<P>
The performances were as distinctive as the musicians involved, though it was 
Dave Alvin's set -- which opened with a moody treatment of "Feel So Bad" and 
ended with an equally dark, solo rendition of "In the Ghetto" -- that was the 
most artfully framed. 
</P>
<P>
But this wasn't a night that invited critical comparisons. There was a 
generous, sharing mood among musicians who had come together to toast a hero 
and to renew acquaintences with their own dreams. In the words of the colorful 
King Cotton, whose hair is as white and puffy as cotton balls, "Happy birthday, 
Big E."

UNDERSTUDIES, UNHERALDED AND OFTEN UNKNOWN, LIVE A REAL-LIFE SUSPENSE DRAMA.

Understudies. As in underdogs. They're not listed on the marquee. When you look 
at the program, they're not in the cast list, and you won't find a biography 
for them. If you squint very hard, you'll find their names listed on the cast 
page, but apart from the cast list, as if in some graphics gulag. 
</P>
<P>
Who in the audience notices them, especially when one came to see Frank 
Langella or Kate Nelligan or Robert Goulet? 
</P>
<P>
But when Langella or Nelligan or Goulet can't go on, the understudy is the 
center of the universe. A moment in the sun -- or in hell, depending on how 
things go. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of horror tales happened in Los Angeles just recently. One saw 
Langella, workhorse of workhorses, flee off stage in the middle of a "Les 
Liaisons Dangereuses" matinee with a nasty stomach problem. Understudy John 
Castellanos came on -- with script in hand. Several Ahmanson Theatre patrons 
were not amused. But when Castellanos also performed that night with the 
script, word got around town. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Hurlyburly," now in its final week at Westwood Playhouse, the 
situation was reversed. The entire regular cast wouldn't go on (claiming that 
the motorcycle accident suffered by friend-of-the-cast Gary Busey emotionally 
disarmed them for the work at hand). The understudies couldn't even help. One 
actress was understudying all three female roles and clearly could not perform 
for all of them. It was a problematic turn of events, admitted producer Barbara 
Ligeti. 
</P>
<P>
It probably didn't occur to anyone that those understudies also missed out on a 
possible performance, which is the whole reason understudy jobs in major shows 
are coveted. 
</P>
<P>
"There's tremendous competition for them," says actor-director Al Rossi, who 
has replaced Victor Brandt as "McCarthy" at the Odyssey Theatre. "It's a real 
plum to be covering for a James Earl Jones." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Savage, who understudied for Kathy Bates in "Frankie and Johnny in 
the Claire de Lune" at the Mark Taper Forum, was told that dozens of actresses 
auditioned for the chance. 
</P>
<P>
"And I'm sure they all knew that it meant being under an actress who's famous 
for not missing performances," says Savage, who actually did go on -- if only 
once. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the whole act of being the one ready to go on if the star (or, more 
commonly, a regular actor) can't, is the drama behind the drama. And it's one 
the audience seldom gets to see. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, going on means a triumphant escape from obscurity. Think of Shirley 
MacLaine going on for an injured Carol Haney in "The Pajama Game" on Broadway 
in 1954. Hal Wallis caught her act and the next stop was Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
It's not unlike the third-string quarterback entering a must-win game and 
firing some touchdown passes. Rossi remembers being sad to learn that he 
wouldn't see Jones in "The Great White Hope," until understudy Yaphet Kotto 
went out and blew the audience's collective mind. 
</P>
<P>
Understudy dreams come true. Understudy reality is more like the kind Laura 
Wernette is experiencing right now, standing by for both Deirdre O'Connell and 
Nora Heflin in the Los Angeles Theatre Center's "Stars in the Morning Sky". 
</P>
<P>
Wernette was hired a week before its Dec. 16 opening. This is standard 
operating procedure at LATC, confirmed artistic director Bill Bushnell, as well 
as at many Equity houses. ("We'll hire earlier with complicated, big cast 
shows," Bushnell added.) Wernette says she can understand why LATC hires so 
late in the game, especially if it's trying to keep on budget. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Actors' Equity contracts provide that an understudy receive the 
same pay as the performer he or she replaces, whether or not the understudy 
actually goes on stage. Pay varies on a show-by-show and actor-by-actor basis, 
but an understudy to a major star could receive the same pay as the star. 
</P>
<P>
(Director-actor Austin Pendleton explains that, in addition to costs, it's 
smart to hire late in the game since many first-rate actors won't sit around 
and wait through weeks of rehearsal.) 
</P>
<P>
"But with 'Stars,' it was pretty rushed," Wernette adds. "Deirdre was sick 
during preview week, and I had to do her part in the last key rehearsals, right 
after I had signed on." At a previous LATC show, 1987's "King Lear" -- one of 
those "complicated, big cast" shows Bushnell alluded to -- Wernette had four 
weeks to watch rehearsals and prepare for Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and, last 
but not least, the Fool. 
</P>
<P>
"You do feel somewhat in prison, wanting to break out and show yourself in the 
role," says Wernette, "while never, ever, upstaging the regular (actor in the 
role). It's a challenging, painful, lonely and very valuable lesson for any 
actor. You get to watch brilliant and not-so-brilliant choices taken by the 
regulars." 
</P>
<P>
While Wernette laments the last-week rush into "Stars," the most notorious, and 
stressful, aspect of an understudy's existence is the last-minute notice that 
he or she is on. 
</P>
<P>
Rossi knows about this. His last three LATC jobs were as standbys. (A standby 
is on call, as opposed to the strict sense of understudy, which means that one 
must be at the theater before every performance. The latter practice exists at 
the Taper, which prefers to identify actors as "covering" roles, according to 
Taper artistic director Gordon Davidson.) 
</P>
<P>
In the last couple of years, Rossi was under Ron Liebman in "Tartuffe," Charles 
Hallahan in "Come Back, Little Sheba" and Robin Gammell in "The Caretaker." 
Under the Actors' Equity production contract, which applies to Broadway and 
large nonprofit houses such as the Taper and LATC, the production need not 
notify the substituting actor until a half-hour before curtain. 
</P>
<P>
The Theatre Center is downtown. Rossi lives in the San Fernando Valley. Isn't a 
half-hour shaving it awfully close? 
</P>
<P>
Rossi: "You'd be amazed what you can do in a half-hour. The hardest thing is 
that you've got to be ready. One minute, you're eating dinner with your family; 
the next minute, the stage manager calls to tell you the lead is sick." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Bennett, who has the formidable task of understudying lead William Solo 
as Jean Valjean in "Les Miserables" at the Shubert, see his current post as 
nothing compared with some past adventures. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time he had to go on in the lead of "March of the Falsettos" at the 
Huntington Hartford with two hours' notice. This was when he was also starring 
in "Movie Star" at the Westwood Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the arrangement I had worked out with ('Falsetto's' producers). I was 
also covering some smaller roles, but I hadn't even read the lead in three 
weeks, though I carried the rehearsal tape with me. Remember that this show is 
a roller coaster and never stops. You can't lose a cue. 
</P>
<P>
"As I sped to the theater, listening to my tape," Bennett recalls, "I realized 
'My God, I've forgotten a lot of this.' During overture, my knees were like 
rubber." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett survived. As Elizabeth Savage says, "This isn't brain surgery. People 
are not going to die." Actually, Bennett and others will darkly joke, at those 
rubber-leg moments, death doesn't seem like such a terrible alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"William Solo and I had the same thought cross our minds the first times we 
went on as Valjean," says Bennett. "I can just walk right out of here and close 
the door. I probably won't work again, but I won't have to go through this.' " 
</P>
<P>
The dizzying aspect of it all, says Savage, is getting ready to go on because 
the lead is turning green, only to turn around and see the lead on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"In the New York 'Frankie and Johnny,' Kathy (Bates) would run off stage with 
an ad-libbed line like 'Sorry, I have to go to the bathroom,' be sick, (co-star 
Kenneth) Welsh would cover for her, and she'd run back on (to finish the 
performance). Ken's standby didn't go on for a year! 
</P>
<P>
"The crucial thing," Savage stresses, "is that you have to assume that the 
actor can't make it, and that you'll cover. At the same time, you try awfully 
hard not to make them feel like you're some vulture, waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Producer Ligeti: "In my experience, I've noticed that understudies for stars 
assume that they'll never go on, and when they find out they have to, they go 
totally ape. Stars are stars partly because they're troupers, and the 
assumption is that the Christopher Walkens and Frank Langellas never get sick." 
</P>
<P>
In smaller theaters, such as the Tiffany, understudies are not required. A sick 
actor can create havoc, as producer Craig Strong learned when one of the 
regulars in "Ladies' Room" couldn't go on, and the understudy couldn't be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
"We were desperately trying to reach the understudy by phone," Strong explains, 
"but it was out of order. She had no idea of the crisis, it was going on 8 
o'clock, and I had to announce the performance's cancellation to the audience." 
The theater added a performance on Wednesday, and patrons who can't attend have 
been given tickets for another date. 
</P>
<P>
The good side of understudying in smaller houses is that there's a greater 
chance of performing. Savage says that, in those cases, she always gives the 
understudy some shows -- letting them go on for the experience. "There isn't 
much pay, and it's the decent thing to do under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Rossi notes that the more one understudies, the easier it gets. There are, 
however, real dangers of becoming typecast as a substitute. And major actors, 
remarks Austin Pendleton, just won't give understudying the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
The Theatre Center's Bushnell has faced this in the casting crunch, "but the 
way we've gotten around it is promising a major talent like Gerald Hiken 
(understudying Milton Selzer in "The Model Apartment," which closed over the 
holidays) that he doesn't have to come to the theater. This way we're able to 
get extraordinary actors to cover roles." 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton creates some incentives, as he did for Laurie Kennedy, his pick to 
understudy Kate Nelligan in the recently closed "Spoils of War" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"I promised her that I would work with her. A lot of directors just don't. They 
give it over to the stage manager. I also convinced her that it would be a 
great workout, and she'd get paid on top of it. Those promises, plus the 
encouragement to find their own approach to the role, are the attractions for 
top people to understudy." 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy, to top it off, got some performances. But, mostly, it's a lonely wait, 
not wanting the worst for the regular actor while knowing that only the worst 
will mean a chance in front of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
The preference for Rossi is the next closest thing to standing by: replacing 
the original actor, as he's currently doing in "McCarthy". 
</P>
<P>
"The new actor," he observes, "is going to create what makes sense for the new 
actor. Yet it also has to fit within the director's established framework." 
</P>
<P>
Which sounds much like Carol Potter Eastman describing the other 
seldom-understood actors' niche -- the alternate. Eastman was Christine Lahti's 
alternate in last year's "Summer and Smoke" at the Ahmanson, playing matinees 
for the pregnant Lahti, and then taking over the role entirely in the last 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"You sort of have the best of both worlds when alternating," she said. "You 
work a good deal with the director, really honing the character. And you don't 
have seven performances a week." 
</P>

AFTER SOME DIFFICULT TIMES, ACTOR HAS 3 NEW FILMS, IS 'BACK IN FORM AGAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rod Steiger, having gone through some difficult times in recent years, went 
back to work in a big way in 1988: He completed the 56th, 57th and 58th films 
of his career -- one of which, "The January Man," opens Friday -- and a 
television mini-series. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been a very good year for me," the 63-year-old actor said Sunday in 
Irvine, where he had come to accept a Torch of Liberty award from the Orange 
County Anti-Defamation League. "I wasn't working for a while on and off because 
I was ill with a very bad depression, but I don't want to go into that. I'm out 
of it now, and obviously this year I guess, I hope, I'm back in form again. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, people tell me I am. I hope it's true." 
</P>
<P>
During his depression, Steiger continued to work sporadically, sometimes 
accepting roles against his better judgment. "People said, 'If you don't work, 
people are going to forget you,' so I did some things that I probably wouldn't 
have done otherwise," said Steiger, declining to name specific films. "But this 
year . . . I've done things that I want to do and things that I'm proud of." 
</P>
<P>
"The January Man" reunites Steiger with Norman Jewison, who directed him in 
1967's "In the Heat of the Night." Steiger won the best actor Oscar for his 
role as a bigoted Southern sheriff who has to accept help solving a murder from 
a black detective, played by Sidney Poitier. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like old times," Steiger said of his reunion with Jewison, who produced 
this time around. "It was very good to be together again." 
</P>
<P>
In "The January Man," Steiger plays a big-city mayor whose daughter, played by 
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, joins forces with a cop played by Kevin Kline to 
solve a string of bizarre murders. The cast also includes Susan Sarandon, 
Harvey Keitel and Danny Aiello. The film was written by John Patrick Shanley, 
who won an Oscar for writing Jewison's 1987 hit, "Moonstruck." 
</P>
<P>
Steiger's other new films, to be released, are "Tennessee Waltz" and "The White 
Rose." The mini-series "Passion and Paradise," set in the Caribbean, will air 
on ABC in February. 
</P>
<P>
Steiger was honored by the local ADL for his roles in such socially conscious 
films as "In the Heat of the Night," "The Pawnbroker" (1964), in which he 
played a reclusive Holocaust survivor, and "The Chosen" (1982), in which he 
played a Hasidic rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that an artist has got to have some social conscience," Steiger said. 
The arts, he added, can make a difference by raising public awareness of an 
issue. "You awaken a few people." 
</P>
<P>
He listed "The Pawnbroker" and "The Chosen" as his two favorite roles. But 
others remain special, he noted, for different reasons: "No Way to Treat a 
Lady," for the chance it gave him to play comedy; "Dr. Zhivago," because he 
feels he proved that an American actor could play "style" roles normally 
reserved for the English; "Oklahoma!" for the chance to dance and sing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death," Steiger said of his role in "Oklahoma!" He has always 
been a frustrated singer, he said. "I was cursed with a good voice and a lousy 
ear. I think I've always wanted to be Frank Sinatra. I wanted to be a saloon 
singer." 
</P>
<P>
Steiger's most enduring movie moment well may be the famous taxicab scene from 
1954's "On the Waterfront," in which he tries to talk his brother, played by 
Marlon Brando, out of testifying against the corrupt local longshoreman's 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult at the time," Steiger said. To make things harder, Brando 
left before they finished shooting the scene, forcing Steiger to shoot his 
close-ups by himself. "I never forgave Marlon for that," Steiger said. 
</P>
<P>
Steiger has always had little patience for the business side of movie making, 
and he believes that things have gotten much worse in the 30-plus years he has 
been in the business. 
</P>
<P>
"There seemed to be more joy years ago, more fun, more happiness. Now it's so 
calculated, so computerized. It's brutal," Steiger said. 
</P>
<P>
The new Hollywood power-brokers, he continued, appear to have no interest in 
the quality of their product, only in the bottom line. "It's a computerized, 
conglomerate enterprise that's gradually taking over and suffocating the 
artistic possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he added, "as you get older, things slow down." In an industry 
that aims its product at an audience 14 to 28 years old, he said, there are not 
many quality roles for 63-year-old actors. 
</P>
<P>
Still, looking back over his films, Steiger is comfortable. Sure, he's done 
some clinkers, but he said he considers himself "60% virgin and 40% whore. I'm 
comfortable with that. I want to keep that margin," he said. "I don't want it 
to drop to 50-50, because then it's a matter of opinion."

INGRAM TAKES OFFER FOR MICRO D DIRECTLY TO STOCKHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SCHINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ignoring an earlier rebuff by the board of directors of Micro D Inc., Ingram 
Industries Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., launched a $37-million tender offer Monday 
for the 41% of the Santa Ana computer products distributor that it doesn't 
already own. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the price of Micro D's stock jumped 50 cents a share Monday to 
$13.75, well above Ingram Industries' offer of $12.50 per share, on speculation 
that competing offers for the nation's largest wholesaler of computer products 
will develop. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Microamerica Inc. of Marlborough, Mass., has made inquiries about 
purchasing all of Micro D's stock for $15 a share, according to Securities and 
Exchange Commission documents filed by Ingram on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Ingram Industries already controls 59% of Micro D's stock. And President E. 
Bronson Ingram said his firm's interest in the Orange County company "is not 
for sale" to a third party. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D has been trading above $12.50 a share ever since Ingram Industries 
proposed in December to acquire all of the company's stock for that amount. The 
original offer was rejected as inadequate by a committee composed of Micro D's 
three outside board members. 
</P>
<P>
In bringing the takeover bid directly to shareholders, Ingram said his company 
did not increase the $12.50 because a review of Micro D's financial data 
indicated that a higher offer was not warranted. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Micro D's board last week, Ingram criticized the company 
for obtaining market share at the expense of profit margins and concluded that 
Micro D "is unlikely to achieve projected 1989 sales growth." 
</P>
<P>
"We've made what we consider is a full and fair price, and we intend to abide 
by that price," Ingram said Monday. "We'll buy those shares if someone agrees 
with us. If they don't, obviously they'll continue to hold their shares." 
</P>
<P>
By seeking to acquire all of Micro D's outstanding shares, Ingram Industries 
hopes to eventually merge Micro D's operations with its own smaller computer 
products distribution subsidiary, Ingram Computer of Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ingram Industries has had a controlling interest in Micro D since 
1986, the firm only holds three of Micro D's seven board seats. Micro D 
insiders own about 7% of the company's stock, with the rest owned by public 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier documents filed with the SEC, Ingram Industries said it had recently 
tried to interest Micro D's management in buying Ingram Computer. But since 
talks failed to result in an acquisition, Ingram opted to pursue a merger of 
the two companies, the filing stated. 
</P>
<P>
"As we continue to expand, we are creating overlapping distribution with Micro 
D. There is very little overlap at this point, but there will be more, and we 
would like to avoid the problems that this would bring," Ingram said. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D shareholders have until Feb. 3 to respond to the tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D Chairman Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy said that the company could not comment 
on the offer until it files its response with the SEC. A company press release, 
however, said the offer is under consideration by Micro D's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the initial merger talks in December, Lacy said he favored 
combining the two companies at a fair price. 
</P>
<P>
Micro D sales are expected to top $525 million in 1988, or about 15% of the 
$3.7-billion personal computer products distribution market. 
</P>
<P>
Besides its computer products business, Ingram owns marine transportation, oil 
and gas exploration, and insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes magazine recently estimated Ingram Industries' annual sales at more than 
$1 billion, a figure that Ingram said was "within the realm of reason."

FEWER FAMILIES CAN BUY MEDIAN-PRICED HOME; 
</P>
<P>
REALTORS' AFFORDABILITY INDEX MATCHES 4-YEAR LOW HERE OF 16% IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fewer than one in six Orange County families could afford to buy a typical, 
single-family, resale house in November, matching a 4-year low set just 2 
months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The California Assn. of Realtors said Monday that 16% of the county's families 
could afford to buy a median-priced home, which cost $230,701 in November, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
November's affordability index, down from 17% the previous month, tied a 16% 
low set in September, 1988, and reflects the tremendous increase in home prices 
over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, when the median price was $178,870, 26% of families could 
afford to buy. 
</P>
<P>
To buy a median-priced home in November, 1988, a county family needed a minimum 
annual income $72,580 to qualify for monthly mortgage payments of $1,815. 
</P>
<P>
That's assuming a 20% down payment and an average mortgage rate -- a composite 
of both fixed and variable-rate mortgages -- of 9.48%, according to the trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
The affordability index is based on a comparison of the median price of 
single-family, detached homes on the resale market and the median incomes of 
county residents. 
</P>
<P>
The association survey excludes more expensive new homes and less costly 
condominiums. It also overlooks pockets of lower-priced housing around the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
But it does provide an indicator of which direction the trend is moving: The 
percentage of residents who can afford to buy a house has been moving downward 
through most of the last year. 
</P>
<P>
Home buyers statewide also faced a crunch in November, 1988, though not as 
severe as in Orange County and some of the state's other urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Just 21% of residents statewide could afford a median-priced home in November, 
the lowest that number has been since the trade association began charting the 
monthly changes in January, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, the association only charted the number on a yearly basis. The 
annual percentage fell to the low teens in the recession years of the early 
1980s, when interest rates soared. 
</P>
<P>
The trade association said it expects the affordability figures to drop further 
from November's levels as interest rates increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
A California family needed an annual income of $55,838 to afford the statewide 
median home price of $177,485 in November. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, 48% of families nationwide could afford a median-priced home at 
$87,900. 
</P>
<P>
In California, San Francisco remained the market with the lowest percentage of 
people able to afford a home, at just 11% in November.

<P>
Back in Orange County, some real estate agents have taken a closer -- and, they 
contend, more realistic -- look at the affordability problem. 
</P>
<P>
According to the East Orange County Board of Realtors, such surveys should also 
include condominiums, not single-family homes only. About 25% of 
multiple-listings sales are condos. 
</P>
<P>
The board also says the trade association's countywide survey obscures more 
affordable neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Using just the local statistics, Realtor Richard C. Poucher calculated that 
29.5% of county families could afford a median-priced house or condo in the 
board's market: Santa Ana, Orange, Tustin and Villa Park. The median price was 
$178,000 in November. 
</P>
<P>
For December, the percentage slipped slightly to 28.5%, according to Poucher. 
Countywide figures are not yet available for December. 
</P>
<P>
The four cities account for about 20% of the county's population and 30% of its 
area, the board said. 
</P>

<P>
AFFORDABILITY INDEX FOR EXISTING HOMES 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen percent of Orange County households could afford to buy the 
median-priced resale home in the county in November, 1988, compared to 17% in 
October, 1988, and 26% in November, 1987.

A veteran Los Angeles police officer assigned to traffic courts has been 
arrested on suspicion of tampering with files in an effort to block prosecution 
of a suspect in a drunk-driving case, investigators reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Officer Edward Romero, 44, a member of the force for 20 years, 
removed a document from a court file in exchange for money. He was released on 
$5,000 bail after his arrest Monday night on an obstruction-of-justice count. 
The suspect in the court case was not immediately identified.

six years in prison for racketeering and other crimes.

"I deserve anything I get for what I've done. I feel sick over what I've done," 
Ehrlich told Judge Constance Baker Motley in U.S. District Court. Motley 
admonished Ehrlich for his "major and substantial role" in the Wedtech scheme 
and fined him $222,000. Ehrlich, a former deputy commander of the New York 
National Guard, could have received 135 years in prison and been fined $6.3

WELFARE RECIPIENTS LOSERS IN GOVERNOR'S NEW BUDGET;

$47-BILLION FISCAL PLAN UNVEILED

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian today unveiled a $47.75-billion state budget that denies 
cost-of-living increases to welfare recipients while boosting spending on 
prisons by 12.8% and schools by 8%. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian conceded in a written statement that the budget bill "does not 
adequately provide for all state government services despite the vigorous 
health of California's economy." He put most of the blame on Proposition 98, an 
initiative approved by voters two months ago which mandates that all state 
revenues in excess of the so-called "Gann limit" cap must go to schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor said in a speech today that both Proposition 98 and the 
10-year-old Gann limit should be reviewed and possibly repealed because of the 
unrealistic restraints they have put on budgeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't wish to have to make any of these reductions," Deukmejian said of his 
health, welfare and other cuts during a breakfast speech to the Sacramento 
Comstock Club. "But if the Legislature doesn't support such actions, I fear 
that the alternative will be much worse." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said that an alternative would include staff cutbacks at state 
mental hospitals, a $200-million cut in local mental health services and 
reduced funding for alcohol and drug treatment programs, Alzheimers research 
and senior nutrition programs. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,355-page spending plan which the Republican governor formally submitted 
to the Democratic-controlled Legislature this morning proposes a total of 
$47.753 billion in state spending for the next fiscal year, up 5.9% from the 
current level. 
</P>
<P>
The budget act also distributes to state agencies and local governments 
throughout California an additional $18.48 billion in federal funds, for a 
total spending package of $66.239 billion, an overall 5.1% increase. 
</P>
<P>
On a percentage basis, prisons, which have doubled in inmate population during 
Deukmejian's governorship, would get the biggest increase among major state 
programs, up by $210 million, to $1.86 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But in total dollars, by far the biggest increase in the spending bill is the 
budgeted $1.171 billion hike in the state support budget for schools, to $18.86 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Community colleges would get a 7.2% increase, to $2.42 billion in state aid; 
state colleges would increase by 8.4%, to $2.02 billion, and the University of 
California by 4.7%, to $2.50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the welfare grant freeze -- which cannot be imposed without a 
majority vote of the Legislature to waive automatic cost-of-living adjustments 
in current law -- Deukmejian also proposed a freeze on funding for in-home 
supportive services and cuts in some locally administered programs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed state transportation budget, including all highway construction 
and maintenance and mass transit subsidies, is $3.31 billion, down $101 million 
from the current year. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's proposed overall increase in state spending on welfare, Medi-Cal 
and other health programs is only $42 million, or 0.4% of the $11.6-billion 
state health and welfare budget. 
</P>
<P>
The health and welfare budget also includes $103 million to fight AIDS 
(acquired immune deficiency syndrome), an allocation Deukmejian described as 
"more than any other state."

Ten Japanese banks will lend a total of $5.1 billion to help finance U.S.-based 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc., a bank official 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was believed to be the largest ever by Japanese banks for such a 
transaction. The official who provided the figure insisted on not being 
identified by name or bank, although his bank is one of the 10 involved in the 
deal. KKR will be using a total of $14 billion in bank loans to finance its 
record $24.53-billion buyout of RJR Nabisco. Mitsubishi Bank earlier confirmed 
that it had offered KKR a loan, but a bank official declined to specify the 
amount.

It remains to be seen whether CBS' Pat Sajak can beat NBC late-night king

According to A. C. Nielsen Co. television ratings released today from the 17 
biggest television markets, Sajak's 90-minute talk show had a rating of 7.0 and 
a 25 share, to a 6.1 and 18 for the hourlong "Tonight." Sajak and Carson won't 
go head to head until Wednesday night. 
</P>

Sajak also was up against the first half of "Late Night With David Letterman"

A robbery suspect who could not elude a police dog managed to escape from his

hospital, Santa Ana police said. 
</P>

The suspect, Eric Moore, had been captured under a house on West Cubbon Street

two men had taken his wallet and two gold rings, police spokeswoman Maureen

<P>
Moore, who was bitten several times in the capture, was taken to Western 
Medical Center at about 4:30 a.m. and then disappeared.

"We're investigating how he got away," Thomas said. "Some of our officers were 
present, but he managed to escape at some point when being examined for his 
bite injuries." 
</P>

A 17-year-old boy arrested with Moore also was treated for dog bite wounds and 
taken to Juvenile Hall.

CHP WARNS ON CAR-POOL VIOLATIONS

<P>
The California Highway Patrol warned today that three officers will work 
overtime to ticket solo drivers and illegal lane changers in the car-pool lane 
that opens Wednesday on a section of the northbound San Diego Freeway from 
Westminster to Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
And those tickets will cost twice as much. A new state law took effect Jan. 1 
doubles the minimum fine for lane violators to $100, and sets the maximum fine 
for repeat offenders at $500. 
</P>
<P>
Orange cones blocking motorists from using the completed, 4.5-mile section 
between Springdale Street and Interstate 605 will be removed late tonight, so 
that commuters can start using the lane Wednesday morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Mike Mikita said that, beginning immediately, the CHP will assign two 
extra officers to work overtime during the day and a third at night to 
ticketing solo drivers or those who enter and exit the special lane across the 
four-foot buffer area and double-yellow line that separate it from regular 
traffic. The CHP will also add another regular "beat" officer on the route for 
daytime enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no grace period," Mikita said. 
</P>
<P>
Mikita said he expects some traffic congestion Wednesday under the I-605 
overpass in Seal Beach, where the car-pool lane gradually merges into a regular 
traffic lane.

GULF STATES TIGHTEN TAP ON OIL FLOW

Gulf states generally turned oil taps lower in early January to comply with an 
OPEC pact aimed at boosting prices by trimming output nearly 20%, Gulf oil 
industry sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
They said Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, slashed output to 3.6 million barrels a day in the week 
ended Jan. 8 from 7.4 million the week before. 
</P>
<P>
The lower production easily meets the kingdom's new daily quota of 4.524 
million barrels which went into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems there has been a general downward trend in output in the Gulf in the 
first week as all states intend to abide by the (OPEC output) agreement," an 
oil industry analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have lowered output to 
their respective quotas of 1.037 million and 988,000 barrels a day, oil 
industry sources in the Gulf said. But both states have reduced output from 
December levels, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The 13 members of OPEC agreed in November to cut output to 18.5 million barrels 
a day in the first half of 1989. OPEC output in December was estimated at 22.76 
million barrels a day, according to a Reuters survey.

BANK WILL PAY RECORD $14 MILLION TO VICTIMS IN DISCRIMINATION CASE

<P>
A Chicago bank that was the government's biggest target of racial and sexual 
discrimination charges has agreed to pay $14 million in back pay, the largest 
such settlement ever obtained by the federal government, the Labor Department 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement also requires Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank to revise its 
affirmative action policies, provide training and other assistance to women and 
minority workers and file periodic reports with the government documenting its 
compliance with anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
The $14 million in back pay Harris Trust agreed to pay is the largest such 
settlement ever obtained by the government from a single employer. It was not 
immediately clear how many current or former bank employees will share the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement ends a controversial dispute with the government that dates back 
to 1977 and involved a 1965 presidential order requiring federal contractors to 
refrain from discrimination against minorities and women in their hiring, 
promotion and wage policies. 
</P>
<P>
A sidelight to the case was an unsuccessful 1985 effort by then-Atty. Gen. 
Edwin Meese III and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to persuade President Reagan 
to repeal the executive order. They argued that requiring affirmative action 
goals and timetables to make amends for institutional bias amounted to reverse 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
An administrative law judge in 1981 found that Harris Trust had discriminated 
against women and minorities and awarded $12.2 million in back pay to 
plaintiffs in a class-action suit against it. But then-Labor Secretary Raymond 
J. Donovan set aside the decision, saying the bank had been wrongly denied an 
opportunity to present statistical studies in its defense. 
</P>
<P>
The case was then reheard. In 1986, Administrative Law Judge Nahum Litt again 
ruled that the bank was liable for back pay to women and minority employees on 
its payroll from 1974 until Dec. 22, 1986, unless it could prove that it had 
ceased the discriminatory practices before that date. 
</P>
<P>
The following summer, in an additional ruling in the case, Litt said the 
awarding of back pay should be treated as a class action.

<P>
K mart Corp. was hit with a $60-million judgment today when a federal jury 
found that the nation's second-largest retailer had breached a contract with a 
now-defunct clothing buyer. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion House charged K mart with ignoring a 1983 agreement requiring the 
retailer to purchase 85% of its name brand and designer label apparel through 
the wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
K mart canceled the four-year contract in April, 1986, shortly after Fashion 
House filed suit against it for unpaid commissions. 
</P>
<P>
K mart lawyer Robert W. Steele told the jury in U.S. District Court here the 
contract was canceled not because of the impending lawsuit over commissions but 
because Fashion House repeatedly failed to obtain the name brand merchandise 
the retailer wanted. 
</P>
<P>
He said the stock K mart received came in broken lots, odd sizes and 
unattractive colors, and that the retailer lost $45 million in its Designer 
Depot stores, which Fashion House stocked almost exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
Steele could not be reached for comment today.

Faberge Inc. said today it is in preliminary talks to sell its toiletries, 
cosmetics and fragrances businesses to Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant 
Unilever NV. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Faberge is a subsidiary of E-II Holdings Inc. The company sells 
hair-care products, fragrances and toiletries worldwide, and bought Elizabeth 
Arden cosmetics from Eli Lilly &amp; Co. in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Faberge Chairman Dan Manella declined to comment on what price Unilever, with 
$39 billion in annual sales, had offered for his company. Faberge, which had 
sales of $1.1 billion in 1987, gave no further details on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
Unilever was rumored last month to be a suitor for tobacco firm American Brands 
Inc., which E-II Holdings also pursued in early 1988. E-II Holdings is the 
holding company for several of the former Beatrice Cos. firms.

Defending champion Pam Shriver, returning after a five-week break, easily won 
her opening match of the $350,000 New South Wales Open tennis championships at 
White City today. 
</P>
<P>
But Henri Leconte of France, top seed in the men's field, was upset in his 
first-round match on the second day of the weeklong tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The event is serving as a preliminary to the Australian Open starting in 
Melbourne on Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
Shriver, seeded second behind Martina Navratilova, scored a 6-1, 6-4 victory 
over Australian teen-ager Jo-Anne Faull. 
</P>
<P>
The victory advanced the American into the third round of the 56-draw Virginia 
Slims women's event, being staged in conjunction with a 32-draw Nabisco Grand 
Prix men's event. 
</P>
<P>
The top eight women's seeds have byes through the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Leconte, ranked ninth in the world, also was returning after a rest but found 
the heat-wave conditions and Sweden's Peter Lundgren too much, losing 6-4, 6-3 
in a first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Couldn't Move' 
</P>
<P>
Leconte, winner here in 1985, blamed a lack of match play and the hot weather 
for his loss. He had not played since the Nabisco Masters in New York early 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
'It always takes me a while to get going. It was very hot out there today and I 
couldn't move," Leconte said. 
</P>
<P>
Lundgren, ranked 66th in the world, counts Pat Cash, Mats Wilander and Ivan 
Lendl among his victims.

A bill that would impose a criminal penalty on anyone caught taking or 
supplying anabolic steroids without a prescription was introduced today in 
Britain's House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would add steroids to a list of controlled substances covered by the 
1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, making them illegal for the first time in Britain. 
Although they are not allowed by most sports organizations, steroids are legal 
in Britain and most other countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The events of last summer only serve to underline the necessity for government 
action to tackle drug abuse in sport," said Menzies Campbell, the Liberal 
Party's expert on sports and sponsor of the bill, referring to drug scandals at 
the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope ministers understand that the physical health of athletes will be at 
risk so long as anabolic steroids remain available," Campbell said.

Hometown favorite Rudi Nierlich of Austria won the men's second giant slalom of 
the ski season today, finishing ahead of veteran Swiss ace Pirmin Zurbriggen 
and Italian star Alberto Tomba. 
</P>
<P>
Nierlich was fastest in the first heat and second-fastest in the second run for 
a winning total of 2 minutes, 44.72 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Zurbriggen was second in 2:45.10 and Tomba third in 2:45.26. 
</P>
<P>
Tomaz Cizman of Yugoslavia was fourth in 2:45.55 and Austrian-born Marc 
Girardelli of Luxembourg finished fifth in 2:45.74. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not nervous at all today," the 22-year-old Nierlich said, hinting that 
he has matured since last season, when his nerves would sometimes fail him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew that Zurbriggen was leading" midway through the second heat, he said, 
"but then I did not do a lot of pondering and just went down full speed. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the kind of track where you had to try and ski not too aggressively 
but ease through the gates." 
</P>
<P>
The Austrian team was bent on getting one man among the leaders. Four 
Austrians, including Hans Enn, abandoned the race. Enn suffered a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Tomba, an Olympic double gold medalist in Calgary, Canada, last year, could 
have done much better had he not made a mistake in the first heat that cost him 
time. 
</P>
<P>
A good track and the fine weather helped young, lesser known skiers starting 
with high starting numbers to make it into the top 30 group for the second 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Ole-Christian Furuseth of Norway, with starting number 51, finished sixth, and 
West German Michael Eder was 10th with starting number 55. 
</P>
<P>
The top American was Tiger Shaw of Stowe, Vt., who finished 16th in 2:48.43.

FOUR INTRUDERS BEAT, ROB TV PRODUCER OF $500,000 
</P>

Four masked men invaded the Beverly Hills home of a writer-producer Monday 
night, banged the man's head against a floor and stole about $500,000 in cash 
and jewelry, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
It took 37 stitches to close the head wounds inflicted on Frank Alesia, 45, 
whose credits include the "Laverne and Shirley" television program. Alesia was 
treated at Beverly Hills Medical Center and released early this morning, 
according to Lt. Robert Curtis of the Beverly Hills Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The assault culminated a five-hour ordeal that began when a masked gunman 
confronted Alesia's butler outside the home and forced him inside. 
</P>
<P>
The butler had taken the family dog for a walk about 6 p.m., Curtis said. When 
the butler returned to the home in the 800 block of North Elm Drive a half hour 
later, the intruder appeared and placed a handgun to his head, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Three other gunmen, all masked and wearing gloves, then entered the house. They 
bound and gagged the butler and his wife and waited for Alesia to come home. 
</P>
<P>
Alesia arrived at about 10 p.m. and was confronted by one of the gunmen when he 
walked in, Curtis said. "He tried to run but he was overtaken by one of the 
bandits and he and his accomplices forced him to the floor." 
</P>
<P>
The robbers then beat Alesia's head on the floor until he agreed to lead them 
to the jewelry and cash, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
The bandits bound and gagged Alesia before they escaped with about $500,000 in 
cash and jewelry. They also took Alesia's 1983 Toyota Tercel. 
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the scene shortly after midnight.
