MIGRANT SEEKS AN END TO BEATINGS, ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Candido Salas says he isn't the first migrant worker to be kidnaped, beaten and 
humiliated outside two brothers' rural Carlsbad grocery store. But if he gets 
his way, he will be the last. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago, as he waited for a day job outside the Country Store on El Camino 
Real, the 26-year-old migrant worker was allegedly handcuffed and punched 
several times by store owner Rickey Joe Ryberg and his brother Randy -- in what 
police have said may have been an attempt to scare migrants from the market. 
</P>
<P>
After handcuffing Salas to a railing behind the store for two hours, police 
said, the Rybergs bound the migrant worker's hands and feet with duct tape. 
They then put a brown paper bag over his head. On the bag, they scrawled "No 
Mas Aqui," or ungrammatical Spanish for "Don't Come Back," authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
He may not speak English or even live in the United States legally, but Salas 
believes he and other migrant laborers deserve better treatment. So he is 
pressing the prosecution of the brothers, who last week were charged with 
kidnaping, false imprisonment, battery and civil-rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
"We've asked them for justice," he said of police and prosecutors. "We've told 
them that we're illegals but that we don't deserve to be treated like this. 
We're people. We're not animals." 
</P>
<P>
But these days, the parking lot of the market they call "La Gallina" for the 
large fiberglass rooster perched on its roof, has become a dangerous place to 
seek work, Salas and other migrants say. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the Ryberg brothers have repeatedly harassed migrant workers 
who congregate outside their store, laborers contend. 
</P>
<P>
The Rybergs are suspected of randomly abducting at least three other laborers 
besides Salas and giving them the same harsh treatment -- a paper bag placed 
over their heads after they were beaten, handcuffed and held for hours against 
their will, the victims said. 
</P>
<P>
Migrant workers say as many as four others have been kidnaped by the brothers 
-- who police say are both over 6 foot 4 and weigh more than 220 pounds each -- 
but were spared the indignation of wearing the paper bag. One worker returned 
to Mexico after his arm was reportedly broken. 
</P>
<P>
The Rybergs have also chastised potential employers who drove up to their 
leased grocery-store lot, workers say. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, neither brother would comment on the alleged attacks. 
</P>
<P>
But Carlsbad police say they are investigating several new complaints of 
assaults against migrants outside the store -- reported by laborers who were 
apparently too timid to come forward before. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I'm hearing," Detective Richard Castaneda said of the alleged 
kidnapings and attacks. "We've talked with several migrants who told us what 
supposedly went on. The whole works is still under investigation. But it will 
all come out in the end." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several laborers have forsaken the once-popular street corner near 
the Rybergs' store to look for work elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Salas, on the advice of Carlsbad police, now avoids the store. Instead, he 
walks to a convenience store near Interstate 5. On Tuesday morning, before he 
reported to a nearby job site to pick tomatoes for $5 an hour, he spoke of his 
determination to take the brothers to court. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to prosecute because if we let this case go, they might one day kill 
one of my companions," said Salas, a slight man who barely weighs 100 pounds. 
"If we stop here, the police won't pay any more attention to us. They'll say 
we're not serious enough to pursue these cases." 
</P>
<P>
Castaneda said he is impressed by the resolve demonstrated by the migrant 
worker: 
</P>
<P>
"I sense that, after his lead, these people are getting to the point where 
they're going to start coming out of the woodwork to tell us what has been 
happening up there." 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad police also are looking into a report by migrant workers that a U.S. 
Border Patrol agent, who arrived at the market before Carlsbad police, saw that 
Salas had been tied up but left the scene without taking any action after 
talking with one of the Ryberg brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Swofford, a spokesman for the U.S. Border Patrol, said his agency had not 
yet been contacted by Carlsbad police and would not say whether an in-house 
investigation of the incident would be initiated. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were," he said, "I wouldn't be able to talk about it, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Salas, who left his wife and two preschool children in Mexico four months ago 
to find work in the United States, said he has already paid a price for the 
kidnaping. Now, he must seek work at a location known to fewer bosses, while 
watching many of his friends return to the Country Store. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where you go to find work," he said. "That's where all the big bosses 
come." 
</P>
<P>
But Candido Salas will have his day in court. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain why it happened," he said of the alleged kidnaping and 
repeated violence. "We're not shoplifters. We go into the store, the Mexicans 
and Guatemalans, and we buy more things than the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"But they still treat us rough. They push us around. They wouldn't even give us 
a place to stand in from the rain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way they treated us. It's an injustice."

MAYOR'S MOTIVES SPAWN FRENZIED DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stunned by Mayor Maureen O'Connor's announcement that she will not seek 
reelection in 1992, local civic leaders spent much of Tuesday speculating on 
the motives for her surprising decision even as they began assessing how it 
dramatically alters the city's political horizon. 
</P>
<P>
It ranks as one of the central ironies of O'Connor's 3 1/2-year-old mayoralty 
that her planned early retirement -- announced during Monday's annual State of 
the City address -- has spawned more frenzied debate and wide-ranging 
interpretations than perhaps anything else that she has done since becoming the 
city's first woman mayor in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, the 43-year-old O'Connor reaffirmed that she plans to 
step down in order to be better-positioned to campaign for the sweeping 
political and City Hall ethical reforms that she proposed in her Monday speech 
-- changes that, among other things, would move the city closer to a 
strong-mayor form of government by giving the mayor veto power over City 
Council actions. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the changes I'm proposing to be the issue -- not my motives," O'Connor 
said. "Since I'm not going to be the long-range beneficiary of these changes, 
critics won't be able to say that I'm power hungry or just out to strengthen 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
Some San Diego leaders wondered aloud Tuesday, however, whether additional 
factors influenced her decision. A few O'Connor allies suggested that her 
growing disdain with an increasingly fractious council and personal 
distractions -- notably, the fact that her father recently suffered a serious 
stroke and her husband's long-time leukemia -- may have played a role in her 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, meanwhile, speculated that O'Connor was simply becoming disenchanted 
-- or simply bored -- with a job in which she has been consistently criticized 
for lacking a long-range vision for the city and for inattention to many of the 
major problems facing the city, as well as for other perceived shortcomings. In 
a recent report card in San Diego Political Watch, a monthly newsletter, 
O'Connor was ranked last overall among the council members. A recent San Diego 
Union review also showed that O'Connor had the worst attendance record on the 
council last year -- repeating a pattern seen late in her tenure as a 
councilwoman in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's declaration of non-candidacy also was interpreted by her foes as an 
effort to position herself above the political fray in anticipation of future 
council battles. 
</P>
<P>
"She's trying to stake out the moral high ground," Councilman Bob Filner, who 
has clashed often with O'Connor, said Tuesday. "For the next three years, 
she'll say, 'I'm not running again -- my motives are pure.' But any time any of 
us disagrees with her, she'll say we're politically motivated or that we're 
just after her job. I see a couple of horrendous years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Saying simply, "I'm the only one who really knows," O'Connor dismisses all 
those theories as "total non-factors" in her decision, which she insists stems 
primarily from her strong support for a two-term limit on local elective 
office. Though her first term was a shortened one -- the uncompleted term of 
former Mayor Roger Hedgecock, who resigned after his 1985 campaign-law 
conviction -- O'Connor said she felt that her push for a two-term limit on 
council and mayoral service would have been weakened if she herself sought a 
third term. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the circumstances, a third term was was a very tempting idea to 
play around with, but I finally decided it's better to leave after 6 1/2 years 
than 10 1/2," O'Connor said. "One of the things I like least about politics -- 
and something I think has turned off a lot of people -- is that so many 
officeholders try to hang on forever. We need new blood and new ideas in local 
government. So, I'm going to lead by example." 
</P>
<P>
Among O'Connor's confidants, there was greater surprise over the timing of her 
announcement -- which comes 2 1/2 years before the next mayoral primary and 
with nearly three years remaining in her term -- than over its content. 
</P>
<P>
"She's been hinting for some time that she was leaning this way, so it doesn't 
come as a shock," said land-use attorney Paul Peterson, one of O'Connor's 
closest advisers. "She might have preferred to wait longer to make her 
announcement, but I think the timing was dictated by her desire to campaign for 
these reforms without having it look like she was trying to feather her own 
nest." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the two-term limits and mayoral veto, O'Connor also proposed other 
fundamental changes that would reshape, in both form and content, local 
campaigns and officeholders' behavior at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's recommendations -- which she hopes to put before voters this spring 
on a special mail ballot -- include expansion of the council from eight to 10 
seats, barring council members from voting on projects involving contributors 
from whom they have received more than $1,000 in the past year, confining 
political fund-raising to nine months before a campaign and requiring 
candidates to eliminate campaign debts within 30 days after an election. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the last time that a mail ballot was used in a citywide election -- 
the 1981 convention center campaign -- O'Connor's husband, multimillionaire 
businessman Robert O. Peterson, challenged its constitutionality, suing the 
city all the way to the state Supreme Court, which upheld the electoral 
method's legality. Emphasizing that she prefers mail ballots because they 
encourage higher turnouts, O'Connor said wryly: "My husband and I disagree on 
this, but I guess I should thank him for taking care of the legal questions." 
</P>
<P>
The need for the proposed structural and ethical changes included in her reform 
package has been accelerated, O'Connor argued, by the advent of district 
elections in council campaigns. As the only member of the council still elected 
citywide, the mayor needs additional powers to better balance citywide 
interests against district concerns, O'Connor contends. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is, we've got a system of government that simply doesn't work any 
more in San Diego," O'Connor said. "Without these changes, the problems of the 
'80s will be unsolved in the '90s. I want to give people a new government and 
process they can be excited about. When only 25% of the registered voters 
bother to go to the polls, that's a pretty strong indictment of the system we 
have now." 
</P>
<P>
Though O'Connor views her non-candidacy as strengthening her lobbying efforts 
for the proposed changes, others suggested that it could have the opposite 
effect by transforming her into a lame duck with ever-diminishing clout both 
inside and outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone has to worry about Maureen becoming a lame duck," 
responded San Diego Unified Port Commissioner Lou Wolfsheimer, a longtime 
O'Connor confidant. "Just because you're going to be leaving in three years 
doesn't mean you can't be effective, especially if you're the mayor." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor added: "That's the old thinking of the past. All the way from Eastern 
Europe to San Diego, reform is in the air, and if we want a new San Diego 
Spring, we'd better spring right up there with reforms. That thinking is 
obsolete. Actually, I think I'll be stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, even some O'Connor opponents concur with her analysis that she 
probably had to remove herself as a future mayoral candidate in order to 
effectively push for adoption of her proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that the only way San Diego is ever going to get a strong mayor is 
to have a lame duck campaigning for it," said political consultant Tom Shepard, 
who helped manage the 1983 campaign in which Hedgecock narrowly defeated 
O'Connor. Indeed, when then-Mayor Pete Wilson sought to strengthen the mayor's 
office in the 1970s, his plan was soundly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
While O'Connor's announcement may be tantamount to the opening bell in the 1992 
mayoral campaign, most of the potential candidates whose names are included in 
the early line on the race agree that it is premature to even begin most 
behind-the-scenes politicking. In addition, most confront more immediate 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Three possible mayoral contenders -- Councilmen Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson 
and Filner -- face 1991 reelection campaigns that will mark their first taste 
of district-only races. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, former San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch must first try to win 
this spring's special 78th Assembly District race before possibly turning his 
attention to an office that he has flirted with in the past. And county 
Supervisor Susan Golding, who carefully weighed the possibility of challenging 
O'Connor in 1988 before opting to seek reelection to her own seat, realizes 
that her own political future could be affected by the outcome in the spring 
trial of her husband, businessman Richard T. Silberman, on federal 
money-laundering changes. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're thinking of running in 1992, probably the best thing you could do 
right now is to concentrate on doing a good job at what you're already doing," 
political consultant Jim Johnston said. "It's a little early to be collecting 
checks." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more to the point, as O'Connor herself noted, if her campaign and 
ethics reform package wins public approval, the size of those checks and the 
manner in which they are collected could change the dynamics of the 1992 race. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a new game with new rules the next time around," O'Connor said.

CITY COUNCIL REJECTS BAN ON ALCOHOL; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: AMID HARSH CRITICISM OF EACH OTHER, MEMBERS UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THAT 
THE INITIAL PLAN TO END DRINKING AT PARKS AND BEACHES WAS ILL-CONCEIVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARMANDO ACUNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday unanimously rejected the idea of banning 
alcohol consumption at all city parks and beaches, saying an initial effort at 
a blanket restriction was ill-conceived and a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The council said it will work toward a compromise to balance the rights of 
law-abiding citizens who enjoy a few drinks at the beach without bothering 
others, while protecting residents who feel under siege by a minority of 
drinkers who become drunk, abusive and noisy and at times commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
But before the council voted to send the matter back to its Public Facilities 
and Recreation Committee -- which ignited an uproar last month when it 
unanimously approved the outright ban without notifying the public -- there was 
a spirited debate among several council members, who questioned one another's 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Filner, chairman of the committee that recommended the ban, 
apologized for the haste and acknowledged that more work is needed and that the 
restriction on alcohol was only one part of an overall plan. He noted that the 
committee had scheduled a meeting for today to refine the package, and he 
accused Mayor Maureen O'Connor of "grandstanding" by usurping the committee and 
scheduling Tuesday's hearing before the entire council. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who opposed the ban, defended her actions, saying the committee's 
vote caught everyone by surprise and that citizens had deluged her office with 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who opposed it weren't notified," O'Connor said. "This has caused 
so much confusion" that the entire council was needed to provide direction. 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning Filner by name, Councilman John Hartley, a member of the 
committee, said he was disappointed that O'Connor had tried to "embarrass 
somebody" and accused her of being "irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset at the circus quality (of the hearing that is) designed to put 
someone on the spot or embarrass somebody," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
But the harshest rhetoric was yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
After listening to many opponents of the ban, including the Old Mission Beach 
Athletic Club, which presented the council with 7,000 signatures it said were 
gathered mainly in Mission Beach and Pacific Beach, Councilman Bruce Henderson 
stunned some of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who represents those communities, said that even though he voted for 
the ban as a committee member, he was really against it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a cry of desperation," he said, explaining his vote. He said he voted 
for the ban because he knew there would be an outcry, and the public would then 
force the council to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
After sitting through 2 1/2 hours of debate and hearing from dozens of citizens 
and community groups, an angry Councilman Wes Pratt responded to Henderson. 
While agreeing that a ban "might be overkill," Pratt said that what he really 
had a problem with "is a council member" whose intent was to make a political 
statement and "jerk" people around. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Henderson," the usually mild-mannered Pratt said, "if Custer had retreated 
as fast as you did on this issue, he would have made it, he'd be alive." Pratt 
said it was "inexcusable" and "irresponsible" to force people to take time off 
from their jobs to attend the council meeting when it wasn't necessary, and 
that everyone on the council knows the real problem is a lack of police 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who serves on the committee with Henderson, jumped 
in and defended him. 
</P>
<P>
She said Henderson made it clear last month that he was supporting the ban 
because alternatives -- such as arresting and jailing people who break existing 
nighttime booze bans or are rowdy -- are unrealistic because people charged 
with misdemeanors are routinely rejected at the county's overcrowded jails. 
</P>
<P>
But Pratt was unmollified. 
</P>
<P>
"You manipulated the people to deal with a particular problem," he said, his 
voice rising. 
</P>
<P>
New Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt then said she "echoed a lot of what Mr. Pratt 
has to say," adding that, during her short stint on the council, "sometimes . . 
. it's very embarrassing to say I'm a member of this council." 
</P>
<P>
Manipulated or not, nearly a full house showed up at the council chambers for 
the debate on the issue. Several people living near La Jolla Shores or in 
Mission Beach blamed alcohol use for many of their neighborhoods' problems, 
from noise and rowdiness to petty crime and public drunkenness. They called for 
support of a booze ban. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Moore, a Mission Beach resident, said drunks and overuse of alcohol have 
driven families away from the beach, particularly in the past few years. "A 
California sunset without alcohol is still a beautiful sunset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At least on this day, however, the ban's supporters were outnumbered by foes. 
Both organized groups that sponsor traditional beach-side events and 
individuals complained that they were being penalized for the behavior of a 
relatively small number of people. 
</P>
<P>
Even former Oakland Raiders defensive end Ben Davidson, who is perhaps now more 
famous for his role in the ubiquitous "Tastes great, less filling" TV beer 
commercials for a light beer, came from his La Mesa home to implore the council 
not to take "a step in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
Joined in opposition were such seemingly disparate groups as the Old Mission 
Beach Athletic Club, which sponsors the summertime revelry known as the 
Over-the-Line Tournament on Fiesta Island, and the San Diego Symphony, which 
said a ban would impinge on its Summer Pops concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Other groups that lined up against the ban included sponsors of the annual 
spring Crew Classic on Mission Bay; the Unlimited Hydroplane Race, also held on 
Mission Bay, and the St. Patrick's Day Parade, which afterward holds a festival 
in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Fox of the Irish Congress, the parade's sponsor, said a third of his 
group's budget comes from the sale of beer at the festival, which he said has 
never had alcohol-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
All the groups said that whatever the council does, it should make exemptions 
for organized groups that police their own events. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the groups, there were other residents who said they work hard 
during the week, obey the laws, and enjoy drinking a wine cooler or beer at the 
beach without causing an incident or infringing on the rights of others. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts said it should be clear to the council that passing 
another law won't solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't deprive many people of legitimate recreational activities that 
include alcohol," he said. Roberts, like others on the council, said that 
what's needed is more enforcement of laws already in existence to curb alcohol 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer said she is adamant about placing alcohol 
restrictions at popular La Jolla Shores and adjacent Kellogg Park, including 
banning alcohol on the beach and parking lots, closing the parking lots at 10 
p.m., and restricting the size of fires in beach fire rings. 
</P>
<P>
Filner said his committee will work at creating a comprehensive program to deal 
with beach and park safety. 
</P>
<P>
"We're wrestling with a whole program to deal with inappropriate behavior at 
the beaches. . . . It was our responsibility to look at the ban," he said. 
"There is no magic answer."

MCCARTHY'S DRUG PROJECT GREETED WITH SKEPTICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy got a skeptical reception Tuesday from some students 
at a Van Nuys school for the physically and emotionally disabled over his 
proposal to raise the state sales tax to fight drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy asked about 75 junior and senior high school-age students of The HELP 
Group -- a private nonprofit school and therapy center -- their opinions on 
whether after-school recreation and classroom drug prevention programs would 
reduce the number of students who use illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The school recreation and education programs are two provisions included in an 
initiative McCarthy is sponsoring for the November ballot that seeks to raise 
the 6% state sales tax one-half cent. Supporters of McCarthy's initiative must 
gather 372,000 signatures of registered voters by May to qualify for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $1.6 billion a year earned by the tax hike would be earmarked for 
more police and prisons, and drug prevention classes beginning in kindergarten 
for every student in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Drug abuse is the No. 1 problem in California," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Some students expressed doubts over McCarthy's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you have an after-school program or are out on the streets, you're 
going to run into drugs," said one young man. 
</P>
<P>
Another student suggested that illegal drugs be made legal and then taxed, with 
proceeds going to drug rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
"People can get 'crack' anytime they want it anyway," said a young man to 
McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy asked: "You're saying, no matter what we do, people will use drugs?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," the young man replied. 
</P>
<P>
Many students said they agreed with McCarthy's assessment during the nearly 
hourlong question and answer session in the school's auditorium. But, they 
explained some of the reasons they believe young people use drugs: boredom, 
peer pressure, emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Other students asked McCarthy why more money isn't going to drug treatment 
programs. About 8% of the proposed sales tax increase would go to such 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs more than $650 a day to go to drug treatment, so that only the rich 
people can afford it, not the poor people who are the ones using 'crack,' " 
said one young woman, who cannot be identified because of state laws protecting 
the identity of those who attend schools for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
Some students said drug prevention lessons explain the dangers of drug abuse. 
But many youngsters decide to experiment with drugs despite the warnings 
because, said one student, "People think, 'So what if it kills me, my life 
isn't going anywhere right now.' "

VENTURA BOULEVARD TRAFFIC GETS RELIEF, BUT IT MAY NOT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic along the entire 17-mile length of Ventura Boulevard within the city of 
Los Angeles should flow more smoothly with the recent start-up of a computer 
system that controls the timing of traffic lights, a city transportation 
official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the relief may only be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
City Department of Transportation engineer John Fisher said all 82 
intersections with traffic lights along the boulevard were put on the 
computerized system on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Similar systems operating elsewhere in the city have increased the number of 
cars a street can carry by 7% while reducing traffic delays by as much as 20%, 
Fisher said. "It results in a smoother flow of traffic in the aggregate," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for boulevard motorists, completion of the computerized traffic 
signal project along Ventura Boulevard comes as Caltrans prepares to begin the 
final phase of its widening of the Ventura Freeway. That traffic-snarling 
project will force many motorists off the freeway and onto Ventura Boulevard, 
erasing many of the traffic flow gains realized by the computerized system. 
</P>
<P>
"Once lanes are closed on the freeway due to the widening project and commuters 
get on the boulevard, some of the benefits of the computerized system will be 
lost temporarily," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher's comments came after he testified before the Los Angeles City Council's 
Budget and Finance Committee about the transportation department's request for 
interim funding to pay for the design of a computerized signal project for more 
than 320 additional intersections in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The full system for the Valley, which is scheduled for completion in February, 
1992, at a cost of $20.7 million, would cover all intersections from Victory 
Boulevard on the north to Ventura Boulevard on the south and from Valley Circle 
Boulevard on the west to Lankershim Boulevard on the east. 
</P>
<P>
The computer system, which relies on video cameras and traffic sensors embedded 
in the roadway to monitor traffic flow, is officially called the Automated 
Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) project. Similar systems are in 
operation in downtown Los Angeles and around the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The final, 51-intersection leg of the Ventura Boulevard phase of the project 
was completed two days before a deadline urged by Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar). Katz wanted the ATSAC system installed along Ventura Boulevard 
before the freeway-widening project began and had been critical in the past of 
city efforts to complete the system.

DEFENDANT DENIES MAILING LETTERS IN 'PAY OR DIE' SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a year in jail and several weeks of trial testimony, a former 
Lancaster aerospace worker took the witness stand in San Fernando Superior 
Court on Tuesday for the first time and denied mailing extortion letters to 
hundreds of prominent Antelope Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Faroni's testimony painted the prosecution's case as being built on 
misinterpretation of innocent acts. 
</P>
<P>
The "pay-or-die" letters mailed in late 1988 demanded millions of dollars, but 
no money was ever collected. Faroni, 27, was charged along with 28-year-old 
Roman Makuch with attempted extortion and conspiracy, based on evidence of 
surveillance and other activities that prosecutors portrayed as incriminating. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ronald S. Coen rejected a motion to dismiss the case two weeks ago, 
saying the prosecution had convinced him the defendants are guilty. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Faroni contradicted prosecution testimony that he bragged about an 
ongoing surveillance project, saying he conducted surveillance activity only 
once when he used a camera and tape recorder to spy on a neighbor with whom he 
was feuding. And he denied owning a long-range listening device known as a "big 
ears," which a neighbor said he saw the defendants load into a car before 
late-night drives, during which prosecutors believe they gathered information 
on victims. 
</P>
<P>
Faroni said he owned an old-fashioned flashbulb holder that could be mistaken 
as a long-range microphone. He also testified that he never heard of some of 
the prominent letter recipients -- including two well-known hotel owners and a 
Lancaster businessman who is the chairman of the state Republican Party -- 
until after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't get into politics," Faroni said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven L. Cooley has asserted that Faroni and Makuch had a 
motive for the extortion plot because they were angry that local leaders had 
failed to support the Antelope Valley Film Commission, on which they worked as 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Faroni, who was known to friends as "Rocky" while Makuch was known as 
"Bullwinkle," has been described by detectives and prosecutors as a bright, 
eccentric former Army communications expert believed to have masterminded the 
plot. He was animated and talkative on the stand, recalling the exact dates of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
Cooley, who begins cross-examination today, called Faroni's statements "weak 
and preposterous. . . . I'm looking forward to the opportunity to question 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Clark said he believes Faroni's testimony undercut a 
prosecution case based on circumstantial evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Alternative explanations were given," Clark said. "They can ask any question 
they want, but they are not going to get more than they have."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arraignment for a suspect in a Christmas Eve drive-by shooting in San Clemente 
was delayed for a second time this week Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd Gerald Avery, 18, of Oceanside is scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 23 in 
South Orange County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
His bail remains at $250,000 until then, said Municipal Court Judge Pamela 
Iles. Avery's first arraignment hearing on Monday was delayed as well. 
</P>
<P>
Avery is charged with attempted murder and shooting at an occupied dwelling in 
the shooting that injured Prisca Caudillo, 4, as she played on the balcony of a 
north San Clemente apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Avery's car, which was found abandoned in San Juan Capistrano, was allegedly 
used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Leroy A. Martin said he asked for the delay because he is 
unfamiliar with the case and has not spoken with Avery. He said he has not 
decided if he will accept Avery's case.

IF IT WON'T WORK IN MEXICO . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction of a debt-relief package for Mexico has become a critical test of 
the Brady Plan to ease the debt crisis of the developing nations. The plan, 
already moving slower than expected, could collapse in the weeks ahead because 
of a disappointing response to the rescue package for Mexico. There is 
widespread agreement that the plan can work nowhere if it can't work in Mexico. 
The fate of the Mexican package now depends on the willingness of the 
commercial banks to play the part most people thought they had long since 
agreed to play. 
</P>
<P>
External debt of the poor nations grew in 1989 to a record $1.165 trillion. 
There was a modest shift from debilitating short-term to relatively healthier 
long-term debt as the international rescue effort began to take effect. That 
led Stanley Fischer, World Bank chief economist, to say that there has been 
"substantial progress in advancing the debt strategy, but the future will 
require continued efforts on the part of the debtor countries, their private 
creditors, and official lenders and donors to advance and develop the 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
His wisdom is now being tested in dealing with Mexico's debt of more than $100 
billion, second largest in the Third World. Unfortunately, the response of 
private creditors with debt relief and new capital has fallen short of 
expectations, leaving a gap of at least $500 million in the basic rescue plan. 
U.S. Treasury officials are now trying to fill the gap with a controversial 
bond issue to be sold to Mexico at a discount that critics suggest would 
represent a significant subsidy by U.S. taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
We support a major U.S. governmental role in resolving the debt crisis, but we 
think the funding should be direct and open, not through subsidized bond sales. 
From the moment Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady proposed the plan more than a 
year ago, there has been agreement that taxpayers should not be bailing out 
commercial bankers. 
</P>
<P>
Resolution of the debt crisis has a double importance. It is essential in the 
short term to reverse the declining economic condition of the debt-impacted 
developing nations. It is essential in the long term to global prosperity, the 
economic viability of rich and poor alike, not least the economic well-being of 
the United States. That is why it is a priority for the American government. 
And why it should also be for prudent bankers.

<P>
I am amused, and somewhat bemused too, at one Benjamin Stein's plea for more 
roles for blacks in the movies. As a black man myself, I think Stein asks too 
much. 
</P>
<P>
For example: I'm not a big TV fan, but it does seem to me that there are more 
black shows on the air than there are white. In every movie, blacks have 
leading roles, very often where they would not be found in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
About 10 years ago, several black movies were made, and apparently they lost 
money. As a black, I am not interested in paying to see other people who are my 
color: I need more motivation than that. I think we blacks now have more than 
our fair share on film and that it's time to give that plea a rest.

ARAFAT AND PLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is the difference between a Noriega, a Ceausescu or an Arafat? The world 
condemns Manuel Noriega because he murdered Panamanians who opposed him, and 
prevented his people from having the freedom to choose their own leaders. The 
world condemns Nicolae Ceausescu because his military murdered people who 
opposed him. 
</P>
<P>
Yasser Arafat and PLO factions have assassinated fellow Palestinians who 
opposed them. Why doesn't the world condemn them? 
</P>
<P>
The world understood that Panamanians should be freed from the control of 
Noriega, and that Romanians should be freed from the control of Ceausescu. Why 
isn't it obvious to everyone that Palestinians must be freed from the control 
of Arafat and the PLO? 
</P>
<P>
If Arabs and others wanted justice for Palestinians, they would not have 
deliberately obscured the fact that Arafat and factions of the PLO have the 
same kind of control over Palestinians that Noriega had over Panamanians and 
Ceausescu over Romanians. There will be hope for a just peace for Palestinians 
when Arafat and the PLO are eliminated.

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Benjamin Stein raises very significant issues in his article, "Why Can't We 
Cheer for Black Americans?" (California Commentary, Dec. 25). He has correctly 
pointed out that African Americans are still stereotyped and defamed by the 
electronic media. 
</P>
<P>
Stein focuses on the vilification of black people in the movies and on 
television shows. It is our belief, however, that the most devastating images 
are presented daily on prime-time and late-night news programs. Three brief 
examples should make the point: 
</P>
<P>
1. In spite of the fact that Robert Dupont, former director of the National 
Institute of Drug Abuse, has publicly declared that 80% of America's drug 
abusers are white and only 14% are black, virtually all news reports on drugs 
center on the black community. 
</P>
<P>
2. Although the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (1989) reveals that whites committed 
71% of all juvenile crimes in this country in 1988, the major networks focused 
most of their attention on black street gangs and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
3. Following the recent earthquake in the San Francisco Bay area it was widely 
reported that roving gangs in predominately black West Oakland were taking 
advantage of the chaos by looting. What police thought to be looting turned out 
to have been black youths rescuing victims of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway. The 
officers apologized for the mistaken reports, but few news programs retracted 
the much-publicized tale. 
</P>
<P>
Whether on the movie set, in the TV studio or in the newsrooms, conscious 
decisions are made on a daily basis to perpetuate the degradation of African 
Americans. The resultant negative depiction of black people in the media is 
largely responsible for the rising tide of racism in this country today.

WE'RE TALKING SERIOUS MONEY HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do President Bush and Congress seriously want to slash the budget deficit? If 
so, they might finally try giving the Internal Revenue Service the money it so 
badly needs to enforce the tax laws more effectively. Rep. J.J. Pickle 
(D-Tex.), who chairs the Ways and Means Committee's oversight subcommittee, 
says this year's "tax gap" -- the difference between the taxes individuals and 
corporations legally owe and what they actually pay -- will hit nearly $100 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
If that money could find its way into the Treasury, where it belongs, 
two-thirds of the budget deficit would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
These owed taxes go uncollected because the IRS, like so many federal agencies 
that lack support from powerful political constituencies, gets too little money 
to do the job the law says that it should be doing. Studies show that every $1 
the IRS spends to assure compliance with the tax code brings in $6 to $16 in 
extra revenue. This remarkable return on investment only underscores the 
absurdity of under-funding IRS operations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980 the IRS had the staff and budget to audit 2 out of every 100 tax 
returns. In 1990, says Pickle, it will have the means to audit fewer than 1%. 
Fewer audits increase the chances for successful tax cheating. 
</P>
<P>
This is only the beginning of the IRS' woes, though. Inadequate funding also 
prevents the service from pursuing delinquent taxpayers who have an identified 
unpaid liability of $60 billion. It doesn't let the IRS hire the outside 
experts it needs to win and collect in complex tax-evasion cases. And it forces 
the IRS to stint on training employees, including those who handle the public's 
calls for information and whose answers have been found to be wrong more than 
30% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The record is clear: short-changing the IRS hurts every honest taxpayer and 
every consumer of government services. The remedy is clear as well: Give the 
IRS what it needs to do the job it's supposed to do, and then count the 
additional billions in owed taxes that roll in.

CHECKING OUT IN REAL STYLE

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian took office seven years ago as a man who seemingly had a 
difficult time saying yes to anything. But in Sacramento Tuesday, the governor 
delivered a final State of the State address to the California Legislature that 
made him sound almost like a newly confirmed political activist. The speech was 
a veritable laundry list of positive initiatives involving a gas tax increase, 
mandatory insurance programs, a government-sponsored plan to help first-time 
home buyers and a proposal to make it easier to pass local bond issues for 
year-around school use. 
</P>
<P>
Only once did the Republican governor talk about cutting back government, a 
vague allusion to restricting entitlement programs like welfare and health care 
for the poor to keep them from outgrowing available state revenues. But even 
then, he promised to work with the Democratic leadership of the Legislature -- 
for as long as it takes -- in order to forge a compromise. An agreement may not 
be possible, because maintaining such programs is a fundamental Democratic 
stance. But at least Deukmejian made the offer to work with lawmakers in the 
spirit of cooperation that unexpectedly bloomed and prevailed during last 
year's legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, George Deukmejian has not turned into a Mario Cuomo or a Ted Kennedy. 
But at least the governor finally seems to have sensed the need for state 
government to grapple with problems before they elude solution through their 
very enormity. Significantly, he said passage of an $18.5-billion 
transportation program at the June primary election is absolutely essential -- 
yes, that was the precise phrase he used -- to the economic future of 
California and its quality of life. These were welcome strong words from a 
chief executive who originally had to be tugged and pulled into accepting the 
plan's proposed doubling of the state gasoline tax, from 9 cents per gallon to 
18 cents, over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's desire to leave a positive legacy as governor was apparently the 
cause of his sudden spurt of energy and willingness to work with the 
Legislature last year. So it could be that too many have been too quick to 
write Deukmejian off in 1990 as a lame duck, incapable of having much effect on 
issues. Aides said that he is determined not to limp out of office this year. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative session will not be all roses. As always, money will be a 
sticking point between Deukmejian and Democrats. That shoe will drop today when 
Deukmejian sends his last budget -- California's first $50-billion spending 
plan -- to the Legislature. But his Tuesday address provides a worthy -- and 
challenging -- invitation to the lawmakers for cooperation on a variety of 
issues of substance. If the governor follows his words with action and 
involvement, as he did in 1989, his final year can be a positive one for 
California.

HOLLYWOOD AND BLACK AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Writer Stein makes a good point when he describes Hollywood's reluctance to 
cast black Americans in positive and inspirational roles. I agree totally and 
would like to extend his point to include the responsibility of today's black 
producers to generate movies with a positive and meaningful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent trip to the movies I saw the film "Do the Right Thing," a movie 
that has been mentioned as the best picture of the year. In my opinion this is 
one of the all-time worst movies to come out of Hollywood. It is insulting and 
degrading to the black community. I don't deny the existence of the black 
experience the movie describes, but why must all our black-produced movies 
bring the same negative message? 
</P>
<P>
If black producers can't come up with something positive from the black 
American life style, how can we expect others to do so? I believe our black 
producers have a responsibility to present some of the positive experiences 
that are occurring every day in the black American life style.

MECHANIC FATALLY SHOT AT PACOIMA AUTO SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A caretaker at a Pacoima auto repair business fatally shot a Sun Valley man who 
had been working on a car there Tuesday, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Carlos Daneal Costa, 22, was pronounced dead at the scene in the 13200 block of 
Van Nuys Boulevard, Detective Al Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, a Latino described as 28 to 30 years old, fled, perhaps in a beige 
1965 Chevrolet Impala, Ferrand said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had not determined a motive in the slaying. Ferrand said it did not 
appear that robbery was a motive, nor was there any evidence that the victim 
was involved in gangs or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrand described Costa as a free-lance auto mechanic who paid a fee to use the 
facility for car repairs. Witnesses told police they heard a shot and saw the 
gunman looking down at the victim. Police said the two may have known each 
other, but the nature of the relationship was unknown.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HIDDEN HILLS POLLED ON LOWER-COST HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Hidden Hills began polling residents Tuesday on a plan to build 
lower-cost housing for senior citizens outside the town's gated network of 
private roads. 
</P>
<P>
The Hidden Hills City Council's plan to build 46 units of lower-cost housing 
has generated opposition from some residents, who persuaded the council last 
year to conduct the non-binding advisory poll. 
</P>
<P>
The poll will continue through today and Thursday, with results expected 
Friday, Mayor Chris K. Van Peski said. 
</P>
<P>
Van Peski expressed confidence that residents will back the council, which has 
supported the lower-cost housing plan as a relatively painless way to comply 
with requirements of state law. 
</P>
<P>
The 46-unit project would allow Hidden Hills to settle a lawsuit over its use 
of a redevelopment agency to help finance a needed drain project that was 
expected to cost more than $5 million. State law requires that 20% of 
redevelopment revenues be spent on affordable housing.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 TO STAND TRIAL IN GANG SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three suspected gang members were ordered Tuesday to stand trial on murder 
charges in the slaying of a 16-year-old Granada Hills High School student who 
joked that he had ordered a member of their gang killed. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Flores, 23, of Pacoima, Manuel Madrigal, 22, and Albert Martinez, 20, 
both of Lake View Terrace were charged with the Aug. 27 killing of Jimmie 
Thomas Torrez. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects allegedly are members of a gang known as the Project Boys. They 
are being held in Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison said Torrez belonged to no gang but had been 
jumped by several Project Boys earlier in the year. On the night of his death, 
Torrez told his cousin, Teresa Estrada, that he was responsible for the death 
of Conrad Treviso, one of the Project Boys who jumped him, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Treviso was actually killed during an attempted auto burglary earlier in the 
year, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Torrez was joking, but Estrada believed him and told Flores, Madrigal 
and Martinez. Later that night, the three chased Torrez in a car until he fell 
off the back of a motorcycle, beat him and shot him five times in the back with 
a rifle, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
The three are scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 24 in San Fernando Superior Court.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RADIOACTIVE DEVICE STOLEN FROM TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A soil-testing gauge, containing possibly dangerous radioactive isotopes, was 
stolen from a parked pickup truck in Sepulveda, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The gauge, used for measuring moisture in soil and asphalt, could be hazardous 
to health if it is broken into, said David Murray, radiation safety officer for 
Foundation Engineering Co., the Tarzana geo-consulting firm that owns the 
device. 
</P>
<P>
It was stolen between Saturday evening and Monday morning, when a company 
employee who parked the white truck outside his residence near Nordhoff Street 
and Sepulveda Boulevard noticed it missing, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1-foot-long device was locked in a 2-foot-long orange-colored box bearing 
the international radiation warning symbol, he said. The handle that activates 
the device and exposes its radioactive component had also been padlocked, but 
the key to its lock apparently was in the box and also stolen, Murray said. The 
gauge and its container weigh between 60 and 70 pounds, he said.

LEARNING TO READ

<P>
It is very annoying to know that illiteracy has become an accumulated problem 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly, literacy centers could be made to help assist people in learning. Or, 
with all of the different teaching aids for literate people, maybe these same 
companies could make teaching aids for the illiterate. The libraries could 
offer free classes to develop reading and writing skills. Correctional 
facilities should automatically make prisoners attend classes.

115 U-T WORKERS GET CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of a union that represents about 115 newspaper employees ended four 
years of labor negotiations Monday by ratifying a three-year contract with the 
Union-Tribune Publishing Co. 
</P>
<P>
The contract vote came Monday night at a meeting of the Communications Workers 
of America, Local 9400, which represents Union and Tribune employees who work 
at the newspapers' loading dock. 
</P>
<P>
Members had worked without a contract since Aug. 3, 1986. The labor agreement 
calls for pay raises of $67.50 per week in the first year, $25.10 in the second 
and $26.10 in the third. The pact also includes a no-strike clause, a 
management-rights clause and an open shop. 
</P>
<P>
With the mailers agreement, the company has settled disputes with three of the 
five labor unions representing its employees. Negotiations are still under way 
between the company and the San Diego Newspaper Guild, Local 95, and the San 
Diego Typographical Union, Local 221. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the company and the guild will meet Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressmen, the (International Brotherhood of) Teamsters and the mailers now 
have three-year contracts, but with the (Guild) . . . the best offer they've 
made is 16 months," said local guild President Ed Jahn. "They're playing a game 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
Jahn expressed pessimism about the upcoming negotiating session, which was 
arranged by a federal mediator who has been involved in the labor dispute for 
more than a year. Jahn described the company's most recent labor contract offer 
as one designed to "push us to sign a weak contract or to strike on their 
terms."

I feel battered by my government. Five senators have time to plead for a

whether we should execute drug dealers, and close libraries and deny funds to 
our schools.

COGSVILLE FINDS THE GOING SLOW WITH SOCKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PATTERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being a rookie can mean standing around in your street clothes eating a 
sandwich while your teammates warm up for a game. 
</P>
<P>
It can mean sitting in some obscure seat in the upper level of the arena, 
watching your teammates struggle to win a game. 
</P>
<P>
It is a game in itself. A mind game. A frustrating one. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Cogsville, 24, is a rookie defender on the Sockers. Indoor soccer is a 
tricky game, and to him, a new game. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't had to think, second guess and wonder this much since 1984, his 
freshman year at the University of North Carolina. He caught on to college 
soccer soon enough and proceeded to lead the Tar Heels to the NCAA final four 
in 1987. Twice, he was named to the All-Atlantic Coast Conference first team, 
as a defender in 1987 and a forward in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But now, just a few months after the Sockers made him their top draft choice, 
Donald Cogsville is crawling again, searching for the knowledge and confidence 
he needs to take his first steps toward becoming a mature player in the Major 
Indoor Soccer League. Therein lies the frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"Admittedly, it is frustrating," Cogsville says. "It has probably been a little 
more frustrating the past few weeks, because I'm beginning to realize how much 
it really does take to be a good player in this league." 
</P>
<P>
Largely because of injuries, Cogsville played in all of the first 13 games, 
starting two. His only real weapon seemed to be enthusiasm, apparent from the 
look of concentration etched on his face. But his game had no grace or style. 
He wasn't sure of where he should be or why he should be there. Each time he 
was given the ball, it was a mental chore to figure out what he should do with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
He has not suited up the past six games. Because the Sockers have stumbled to a 
9-10 start, and because they have players who are more in tune with the system, 
there isn't much game time to be passed around. So Cogsville will have to sit 
and be patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that he might be another Kevin (Crow)," Socker Coach Ron Newman says. 
"But he's not quite as subtle as Kevin. Don's more like a bull in a China shop. 
We've got to kind of settle him down and control his energies." 
</P>
<P>
Both Crow, the league's defender of the year the past two seasons, and defender 
George Fernandez, who holds a team record of 99 consecutive games played, are 
quick to admit they jumped their fair share of hurdles during the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me three to four months to get to the point where you feel you've been 
playing the game for a long time," Crow says. "I constantly, for a year and a 
half to two years, did nothing but pick the brains of the veteran players." 
</P>
<P>
Says Fernandez: "I've been there. It's tough. It's very frustrating. He's 
probably saying to himself, 'I should be out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
But really, he knows he shouldn't be. Cogsville isn't bitter about his lack of 
playing time because he realizes this is somewhat of an education period. He 
will watch and learn. The veterans and coaches will watch and teach. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got all that lovely athletic ability," Newman says. "Now is the time for 
him to just roll up his sleeves and get as much out of practice as he can." 
</P>
<P>
Working hard is a logical step for Cogsville, who comes from a family of movers 
and shakers. He grew up in Trenton, N.J., and his mother, Carol, who died when 
Donald was a senior in high school, taught him the importance of education and 
cultural awareness. Donald recalls that she never wasted a minute. She was 
always reading books or writing down her liberal opinions in letters to the 
editors of the local newspapers. When she watched television, it was always 
PBS. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never met anyone like her," Cogsville says. "I always say, when I get to 
be rich, there's going to be some memorial for her." 
</P>
<P>
Equally important to Cogsville's development was the influence of his father, 
Donald Sr., an urban developer in Harlem, N.Y. A small school All-American at 
Mt. Union College in Ohio, Donald Sr. spent much of his spare time studying 
unique training methods and teaching them to Donald, who obviously reaped the 
benefits, as evidenced by the well-conditioned 195 pounds on his 6-foot-2 
frame. "He's my inspiration," Donald says. "I've never met anyone who 
understands athletes as much as he does." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, there is more to their relationship than just athletics. Donald says 
his father is a man with dreams and visions. His work to improve the state of 
living in Harlem has rubbed off. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it is the combination of his parents' influence and his East Coast 
background that allows and encourages Cogsville to continually think beyond the 
game of soccer. He is not a one-track person but rather someone who appears at 
ease conversing on a wide variety of subjects, including theater, modeling and 
art. For that reason, he'll never stay away from New York for too long. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always a subway stop away from something cultural," he says. "The 
Guggenheim, the Metropolitan Museum, Broadway . . . I love all that stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"New York's always calling me. That's where my vitality is. That's where I feel 
like I'm alive." 
</P>
<P>
If soccer doesn't work out, theater is his next choice. He gets the same 
adrenaline rush acting in front of an audience as he does playing soccer. 
Cogsville doesn't exactly have false expectations. He is well aware that most 
actors practice their trade after taking orders and serving meals. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, maybe acting isn't for him. 
</P>
<P>
"I admit I can't be a starving actor in New York," he says. "Waiting tables is 
not for me." 
</P>
<P>
What is? Well, for the time being, his focus will be soccer. He'll try to do 
all those things on the field that he is being told to do. Take shorter 
strides. Make better decisions. Get rid of the ball quicker. 
</P>
<P>
The outdoor game comes so easily to him now. He's hoping that this altered 
version will begin to make sense before the end of this season, as it did for 
Crow and Fernandez. Time will be the keeper. 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking about someone who will go at this with a "Oh-well, 
we'll-see-what-happens" attitude. Cogsville has had a little extra desire ever 
since he was left off a youth all-star team at the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
He says he clearly deserved to make the team and never imagined he wouldn't. It 
seems there are always politics involved in these things, and the new guy in 
the area doesn't necessarily get recognized no matter how many goals he scores. 
A kid doesn't always understand these things. A father does. 
</P>
<P>
"He already had his speech prepared," Cogsville says. 
</P>
<P>
The speech was simple. Donald Sr. told him he would always have to be a head 
better than everybody else if he was to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
So, under his father's supervision, Cogsville ran sprints, jumped rope and even 
enrolled in a gymnastics class to help his agility. 
</P>
<P>
The next season he led the league in scoring. He made the all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he is starting over again, a head behind everyone else. But his confidence 
hasn't slipped. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that I can be a great player in this league," he says. "I've 
had to go through some tough times in soccer and it has always been my faith in 
myself that has brought me through. I just want to reach my potential, whatever 
that may be. I won't be satisfied until I do."

OCCIDENTAL MEN UNDERDOGS IN SCIAC RACE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Occidental College men's basketball team will begin play in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference tonight at 8 when the Tigers 
play host to Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Occidental (5-8) has not won an SCIAC title since 1983, and the prospects this 
year appear slim; Claremont, Redlands and La Verne all open conference play 
with 10-3 records. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't remember there ever being three teams in our league with those kinds 
of records going in," Occidental Coach Brian Newhall said. "Usually, we're all 
kind of beat up, record-wise. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I think all three of those teams are for real." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, defending conference champion Pomona (5-8), Caltech (2-7) and 
Whittier (3-11) are hoping a new start translates into greater success. 
Occidental's fate might be determined early. After Claremont, it plays Whittier 
and La Verne at home. "We need to come out of that stretch at least 2-1 to be 
in the race," Newhall said. GARY KLEIN

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: FREE THROW BECOMES A FOUL SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Go figure Gabe Higa, a senior forward for Quartz Hill High and one of the 
Valley's best free-throw shooters. 
</P>
<P>
Higa, last season's Golden League Player of the Year, had made 96 of 102 (94%) 
from the line this season -- before a two-for-nine performance in Friday's 
league opener against Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Capping his dismal showing, Higa missed the second of two free throws with five 
seconds left, blowing an opportunity to force overtime and leaving the Rebels 
on the short end of a 56-55 decision. 
</P>
<P>
"He was hurting real bad about it," Coach Don Moore said. "But I don't know who 
else I would rather have up there. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the (team's) best free-throw shooter. I don't know what happened. He just 
kinda choked a little bit at the end, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Breaking tradition: Harvard Coach Greg Hilliard is enjoying his team's 13-2 
start but adds that the Saracens can look awkward if their blitzkrieg break 
isn't clicking. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody catches you on a bad night, it's like, 'Geez, they don't have 
any discipline,' " Hilliard said. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to make seven passes before we shot," he said. "Now, we wait about 
seven seconds before we shoot." 
</P>
<P>
Short-handed: Many basketball teams have been decimated by the latest flu bug. 
The Highland Hall girls have taken it a step further. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent game against Claremont of Garden Grove, the Hawks' roster of eight 
was pared to four. One player was out with pneumonia, one with the flu and one 
with a broken finger. Monica Palma, who averages a team-high 15 points, was 
snowbound in Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dave Desmond recruited a fifth girl from campus, but another player had a 
work-experience project off campus and did not arrive until five minutes before 
tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
"We had four girls in our stretching drill," Desmond said. "Usually, you make 
them line up or get in a huge circle. We just made a box. We had three girls 
shooting and one rebounding. Real intimidating, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Apparently so. Highland Hall won, 39-12. 
</P>

STATWATCH: ROYAL TIES SCHOOL MARK FOR VICTORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royal High's 69-68 win over Thousand Oaks in overtime Monday gave the 
Highlanders a 14-3 record and tied the school mark for wins in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Royal was 14-10 in 1971-72, the last season in which the Highlanders had a 
winning record. 
</P>
<P>
Scoring: Four players for both Burroughs and Hart are averaging in double 
figures. Burroughs center Ray Velasquez and Hart guard Micah Ohlman each are 
averaging 18.9 points. 
</P>
<P>
For Burroughs, guards S. J. Boldvich (12.9 points) and Marnie Calderon (12.7), 
and forward Doug Castaneda (10.8) also are scoring in double figures. For Hart, 
center Chad Fotheringham (13.1), and forwards Renato Rivas (12.1) and Marty 
Downen (11.5) are averaging in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Three Antelope Valley players -- forwards Chris Walters (20.1) and Jabbar 
Briggs (10.4) and guard Brock Chase (10.1) -- are averaging in double figures. 
Center John Pletsch is averaging 9.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
After averaging 12 points in his first 11 games, Kennedy center Josh Etting 
scored 24 and 20 points last week in two games. 
</P>
<P>
Shooting: Crescenta Valley, which had made no more than 37% of its shots from 
the field in the past five games, shot 50% from the field and 70% from the 
free-throw line Friday in a 65-64 overtime win at Hoover. "We finally played 
ball," Coach John Goffredo said. "We were impostors the last three weeks."

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: USD'S FIRST, ONLY VOLLEYBALL COACH STEPS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first and only women's volleyball coach at the University of San Diego, 
John Martin, has stepped down after 17 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
A university official said the search is on for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, with a 133-219 career record, is leaving the position to concentrate on 
his duties as recreation and facilities director. 
</P>
<P>
"John had two other responsibilities that were extremely time-consuming," said 
Tom Iannacone, USD's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
Iannacone said there is no target date for hiring a replacement but that time 
is critical. The signing date for recruits is Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
One possible candidate is John Cook, who coached at Francis Parker High before 
becoming an assistant at Nebraska. Nebraska was NCAA runnerup to Cal State Long 
Beach this past season. 
</P>
<P>
"If John Cook wants the job and goes after it, he's got it," said Fred 
Featherstone, a former U.S. International coach who intends to apply. "He's got 
tremendous potential as a women's volleyball coach. I think he's the best 
person possible." 
</P>
<P>
A drawback to the USD job is that it is not a full-time position. 
</P>
<P>
Colleen Suwara, recently named national community college coach of the year for 
guiding Grossmont College to the state championship, said she might be 
interested if the position were full-time but added that she is happy at 
Grossmont. 
</P>
<P>
According to Suwara, her brother Terry McLaughlin, a coach at Chemeketa 
Community College in Salem, Ore., is also interested in the position. 
</P>
<P>
In a season of firsts, here is another one for the University of San Diego 
women's basketball team. The Toreras' West Coast Conference opener at 
Pepperdine Friday night (7:30 p.m.) will be telecast by Prime Ticket on a 
tape-delayed basis at 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
USD's 10-3 record equals the best WCC mark in pre-conference play. But the 
Toreras hardly will be at full strength. Two players -- Rachal Chism and 
Rochelle Lightner -- are out indefinitely with injuries suffered late last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Chism, who was red-shirted last season after surgery on her left knee to repair 
ligament damage, will have a similar operation on her right knee Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lightner, who broke her nose twice last season and required postseason surgery, 
broke it again Saturday at Colorado-Colorado Springs. She played for six weeks 
last year with a face mask and might do so again this year. 
</P>
<P>
Paula Mascari cracked her contact lens against Colorado and had to leave the 
game. She has been practicing with glasses this week while a new pair is on 
order. Christy English (bronchitis) and Julie Lemery (flu) will not practice 
this week but are expected to play Friday. Chris Enger is nursing a sore 
hamstring and knee, and Lynda Jones has a sore hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
Said USD Coach Kathy Marpe, "It's our time, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Wynalda, a junior forward, has turned professional and will not return to 
the San Diego State soccer team next season, said Linda Keck, assistant sports 
information director. Wynalda, of Westlake, had 35 goals and 25 assists in 
three seasons. He currently is working out with the U.S. national team in La 
Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Luis Noriega of USD is the No. 1-ranked men's tennis player in the West 
Region, according to the latest Volvo Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Assn. 
rankings. USD's team is eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Suzy Schutz, who led Grossmont College to the state women's volleyball 
championship and a 27-1 season, has been chosen the national player of the year 
by Volleyball Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
"She's just been a great leader for the team," Grossmont Coach Colleen Suwara 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Schutz, who played at Grossmont High, "We had a lot of fun this year. We 
didn't play for the awards or any of that. I didn't even know about it until I 
got it." 
</P>
<P>
Among others, Schutz is being recruited by Texas Arlington, Arizona State, 
Florida, Nevada Reno, Georgia and UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Heritage, which on Saturday defeated previously top-ranked Malone 
College, is tied for the top spot in this week's National Christian Colleges 
Athletic Assn. poll with Olivet Nazarene of Kankakee, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Using computer power rankings, the Hawks (10-4) are tied with Olivet (12-6) 
with a 44.8 rating. Malone (11-5) was third with 44.3. Southern California 
College, The Master's and Biola, three Southland schools with upcoming games 
against Christian Heritage, round out the top six. 
</P>
<P>
Against Malone Saturday in the Westmont Tournament, Christian Heritage trailed 
by three with 7:09 left, but the Hawks scored on their last nine possessions to 
win, 99-92. 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 20, it will have been 38 days since U.S. International men's basketball 
team played a road game. The Gulls' nine-game home stand concludes Thursday 
against Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
USD has not played outside its Sports Center for more than a month. Games 
Thursday (against Pepperdine) and Saturday (Loyola Marymount) will end an 
eight-game stand. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State has played five in a row at the San Diego Sports Arena since a 
pre-Christmas tournament at Alabama Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
None has played the other during these current home stands. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Valley (19-0) of the Pacific Coast Conference moved to No. 1 in the 
state community college men's basketball poll. Imperial Valley is one of only 
two undefeated teams in California.

Paramount Communications Inc.: The New York-based entertainment conglomerate 
reported fiscal 1989 profit of $1.47 billion, up sharply from $385 million a 
year ago, largely due to a $1.2-billion gain on the sale of its Associates 
First Capital Corp. finance unit to a Ford Motor Co. subsidiary. Revenue 
excluding the Associates sale totaled $3.4 billion, up 10%. The firm, which 
changed its name from Gulf &amp; Western Industries Inc., also took a 
$48-million charge for costs incurred in its failed bid for Time Inc.

GUIDE FOR THE DISGRUNTLED MAY HAVE YOUR NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD G. CAMPBELL, Campbell is a syndicated columnist and former Times 
staff writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Like a lot of people, I frequently feel the need to complain to 
someone -- anyone -- when I feel that I've been ripped off. But where do I 
start? Writing to a department store, for instance, is like dropping the letter 
into a big hole. Any suggestions? -- G.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Even with a Rolodex filled with consumer-oriented contacts, I know and 
share your bafflement. You should find a new publication by San Francisco-based 
Consumer Action invaluable, however. It's the 1989-1990 edition of the group's 
16-page pamphlet, "Consumer Services Guide," and it includes the addresses and 
telephone numbers of regulatory and law-enforcement government agencies, 
business-sponsored complaint resolution offices, nonprofit information and 
referral organizations and agencies that offer free, or low-cost, legal 
assistance. I use it constantly. 
</P>
<P>
You can get a copy by sending $1 for postage and handling to: Consumer Action, 
116 New Montgomery St., San Francisco, Calif. 94105. Free copies of the guide 
are available in bulk to community-based organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was deeply disappointed in the answer you gave recently on the way the 
California Lottery publicizes its large prizes -- a deceptive and fraudulent 
practice. Instead of condemning it for the deception that it is, you condoned 
it, and you further muddied the waters with a discussion of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most basic concept in all of economics is the notion of the time 
value of money. A dollar to be paid tomorrow is not worth as much as a dollar 
paid today. The only way you can call that lottery prize "a million dollars" is 
to assume that interest rates are zero. 
</P>
<P>
The quote that a lottery representative gave you: "the money we spend to pay a 
$1-million prize is exactly half that," is a bald-faced admission of that lie. 
Your newspaper could end the deception tomorrow. All it would take would be for 
you to agree that whenever you run a story about a lottery prize, the number in 
the article and the number in the headline should be the present value of the 
award. -- K.G.M. 
</P>
<P>
A: I wouldn't presume to argue with a university professor of mathematics even 
if I didn't agree with you in principle. 
</P>
<P>
I quite understand the concept of the value of money and I am not condoning the 
lottery or the people charged with conducting it. I explained the state's 
rationale for doing it the way it does it -- to keep public interest in the 
lottery at a fever pitch. I don't recall saying that I approved of this 
fun-with-figures way of presenting it. 
</P>
<P>
I agree with you -- any state lottery is a piece of fluff right from the time 
you buy a $1 ticket, only 50 cents of which goes into the "pot" in the first 
place. And, with odds of 14- to 16-million-to-1, this is "gambling" in about 
the same way that diving blindfolded, and armed with a spear, into an 
Olympic-sized swimming pool containing two guppies is "going fishing." 
</P>
<P>
This is pure fantasy. The state knows it and the lottery players know it and, 
speaking of odds, I will lay odds that the next person hitting a "$10-million" 
top prize doesn't give a diddly what the "present value" of that $10 million 
really is -- he sees 20 annual payments of (before taxes) $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last April, American Continental Corp. declared bankruptcy. I am 76 years 
old and my wife is 67. We had invested $45,000 in this company. It was money 
earned with hard work to provide an extra income to supplement our Social 
Security. About 25,000 other investors were involved, and the company used the 
money to buy luxury cars and houses. 
</P>
<P>
We don't know where to turn. Is there any law in this country to protect the 
little investor? -- Z.L. 
</P>
<P>
A: I wish we could be more optimistic here, but it's going to take a long time 
for the federal regulators to muddle through the complex, overlapping affairs 
of American Continental and its many subsidiaries -- the principal one being 
Lincoln Savings, which did, indeed, sell about $200 million in bonds to 
individual investors. And most of those investors, unfortunately, are in the 
same boat as you. Bondholders like you fall under the heading of "unsecured 
creditors" and, in the pay-back line, are behind the other creditors holding 
so-called "secured" claims on the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Laws to protect the little investor," alas, don't really work. With any 
investment there must be some degree of risk. There are laws, of course, 
requiring that the degree of that risk be fully disclosed. And this is where 
tightening up is called for. All you can really do, I'm afraid, is hope that 
enough of American Continental's assets can be sold off to get the bondholders 
at least a portion of their (your) money back.

BIBS BID TO BE LATEST TREND IN DESIGNER DINNER WEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Here's a product both functional and fun. It's Bib-Elite, a fashionable bib 
that can keep that lobster, marinara sauce or salad dressing off your tie or 
blouse. 
</P>
<P>
The washable bib comes in three styles and fastens behind the neck with a 
Velcro-like closure. They can be purchased in 100% cotton or a cotton-polyester 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
These 12-by-20-inch bibs are designed for adults, but there's no reason 
children couldn't wear them, too. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular model is the Tuxedo, which features lapels, a white shirt and 
black tie, says designer Jean Pomerance, president of the Eat Elite Co. in 
Sherman Oaks, Calif. The other styles include the Princess, which looks like a 
black blouse with a white collar and faux pearls, and the Engineer-Western, 
fashioned of blue and white striped work-shirt cloth with a red and white 
checkered neckerchief. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Bib-Elites can be found at the Tops Gallery in Malibu or the 
This n That Boutique in Temple City. Or they can be ordered for $13.95 plus 
$1.50 for shipping and handling from Eat Elite Co., 14844 Dickens St., Suite 
204, Sherman Oaks, Calif. 91403; phone, (818) 986-8677.

<P>
Bringing the World Into Sharper Focus 
</P>
<P>
Sports fans, opera lovers or bird watchers may want to consider the new Perma 
Focus binoculars. They let you see everything from 40 feet to infinity in sharp 
focus. And you don't have to adjust them manually; you just look through them 
and they focus automatically. 
</P>
<P>
The new binoculars' secret is in their optical elements, "engineered to make 
use of the eye's natural ability to focus," say representatives of Jason 
Empire, the Overland Park, Kan., manufacturer of binoculars and telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
There are several models with different magnification powers in Jason's Perma 
Focus line. 
</P>
<P>
The company suggests the Model 194, a 7x35 binocular, for the sportsman, bird 
watcher or baseball fan. For football or auto racing, a wide angle Model 195 
might be preferable. Both are lightweight and come with a wide neck strap and 
nylon case. They retail for about $70 and $80 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Boaters, hunters or horse racing fans might prefer the 10x50 Model 196, the 
most powerful Perma Focus. It weighs 30 ounces and retails for about $100. 
Opera buffs should check out the Model 184, a 6x21 binocular, which fits in a 
pocket or purse. It sells for about $60. 
</P>
<P>
Perma Focus binoculars are sold nationwide in camera stores and by chain 
stores, including Fedco, K mart, Montgomery Ward, Sears, Service Merchandise 
and Target. If you can't find them in your area, contact Jason Empire Inc., 
9200 Cody, Box 14930, Overland Park, Kan. 66214; phone, (913) 888-0220.

Soap Opera Trading Cards Make a Splash 
</P>
<P>
New from Hollywood -- where else? -- are Soap Star! trading cards, 14 3-by-5 
cards depicting your favorite actors and actresses from TV's soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
You'll find Kin Shriner, who's been on "General Hospital" for more than a 
decade; Barbara Crampton of "The Young and the Restless," and Mary Beth Evans 
of "Days of Our Lives," to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after the long-successful baseball trading cards, Soap Star! cards 
offer exclusive color photographs of each star, says their creator, Jim Warren, 
an actor who has appeared in several soaps. 
</P>
<P>
The cards carry a short biography of performers, including a replica of their 
signatures. A second set of cards will be available in March. They can be 
purchased for $6 by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to Red Star, 
P.O. Box 3555, Hollywood, Calif. 90078; phone, (213) 851-5111. LYNN SIMROSS

SCREEN STYLE: BELL-BOTTOM BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCINE PARNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Movie: "Born on the Fourth of July" 
</P>
<P>
The Set-Up: Tom Cruise plays Ron Kovic, gung-ho Marine turned disabled Vietnam 
War vet and anti-war activist. 
</P>
<P>
The Look: Spanning three decades, from the apple-pie Eisenhower era to the 
riotous political age of the Nixon Administration, the film runs the gamut, 
sartorially speaking. Cruise's wardrobe is enormously significant for the way 
it reveals his character's personal transformation. Early on, he's the 
clean-cut, all-American kid dressed in short sleeve plaid shirts, jeans, and 
high tops. After his tour of duty, he's a hippie with long, thinning hair and a 
wardrobe of well-worn denim bell bottoms, plaid flannel shirts, ripped Marine 
sweat shirts and sandals. 
</P>
<P>
The Labels: Please, don't even ask. For the most part, we're talking Woodstock 
Generation. 
</P>
<P>
The Stores: Costumer Judy Ruskin, who worked as an assistant on "Wall Street," 
"Fatal Attraction" and "New York Stories," launched a perfect-oldies quest that 
makes a good story in itself. She was driving on the Long Island Expressway, 
pulled over because she was exhausted, and happened upon a neighborhood general 
store chock full of vintage bell bottoms, Nehru jackets, fringe vests, pointy 
'50s "bullet" bras, the works. "We bought the entire contents of the basement, 
sight unseen, and sent in a semi-truck to pick it up," Ruskin says. "I was 
blessed by the costume gods." Other fashion dinosaurs came from Domsey's, a rag 
house in Brooklyn, where Ruskin and her crew sifted through mounds of used 
clothing that is dumped onto conveyor belts and ultimately shipped to Third 
World countries. Then there was the dry goods store in a small New Hampshire 
town, whose attic was stocked with hundreds of period shoes -- original prices 
still intact. "There I found everything from '50s saddle shoes to hippie 
sandals and clogs to '70s platform shoes," Ruskin says. 
</P>
<P>
The Conflict: Although Cruise had to wear bell bottoms in the film, he despises 
them, Ruskin says. "Tom and I have a bet that if bell bottoms ever return to 
mainstream fashion, he'll buy me the car of my choice." 
</P>
<P>
The Payoff: The end of the '80s is a apt moment for looking back on past 
decades of fashion. The clothes in the film convey transitions in American 
style. In particular, we are reminded of the powerful message of clothing in 
the '60s, when a resounding political statement could be made simply by tossing 
on love beads or a peace symbol. 
</P>
<P>
Postscript: Before his death in April, 1989, Abbie Hoffman made a brief 
appearance in the film, playing himself as an anti-war organizer. He's decked 
out in a tie-dyed T-shirt, a popular fashion of the love-and-peace generation. 
After completing his role in the film, Hoffman gave Ruskin his Woodstock 
T-shirt, one simple garment that carries a wealth of meaning. FRANCINE PARNES

ALICE KAHN: A MID-LIFE PLEDGE TO END VANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am not worried about the graying of America. I'm worried about the degrading 
degraying. So let's make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
We here at the Gonna Die Institute have an offer that will save you months of 
pain, years of grief, hours of time and fistfuls of dollars. It's easy. It's 
simple. And all it takes is one itty-bitty generational commitment. 
</P>
<P>
If every one of you will take The Pledge, we can all be free of our enslavement 
to vanity. Yes, vanity, saith the preacher, is becoming the No. 1 obsession of 
those between 30 and 50. 
</P>
<P>
Because I trust no one under 30, everyone I know is in various stages of 
mid-life crisis. I myself am in the avant garde, which involves standing in 
front of the mirror and systematically imagining life with each of my features 
altered. 
</P>
<P>
I think it really hit me at a party the other night. A woman I hadn't seen in 
years pulled me aside, threw open her coat and said, "Look! They hang down now. 
I've got cleavage." 
</P>
<P>
My friend Veronica is heading toward surgical never-never land. She ran into a 
former boyfriend whose wife is a plastic surgeon. He came up to Veronica and 
said, "You know, Bev does eyes." 
</P>
<P>
Veronica then asked her husband, Rod, if she could get her eyes lifted for her 
40th birthday present. "Bev does eyes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," he responded, "but why start up there?" 
</P>
<P>
Rod keeps rubbing Rogaine on his head. He's still a bowling ball, but his blood 
pressure is down to 30/10. 
</P>
<P>
Kit's getting her hair highlighted. Susan's getting braces. Neal's getting his 
nose fixed. For thirtysome years, these people lived imperfectly, but now the 
slogan seems to be: If I have only one life to lose, let me lose it as a 
blonde. 
</P>
<P>
I thought cosmetic surgery was invented so that rich people could buy 
suffering. All of a sudden, every ordinary slob thinks she's some kind of 
Phyllis Diller. 
</P>
<P>
How will God know who to send to heaven if all the corpses look like Morgan 
Fairchild? 
</P>
<P>
Consider the six stages of life: Birth, Childhood, The Hideous 20s When You Are 
Forced to Grow Up, Mid-Life, Plastic Surgery, Death. 
</P>
<P>
We can't avoid any of them except Numero Cinco. Act now and sign The Pledge. 
Think of the money and the suffering we will avoid. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I am not asking anyone to undo what's already been done. If your nose has 
been bobbed -- just leave it in the air. If your breasts have been augmented, 
well, hold it right there. If your chin has been lifted, let the chips fall 
where they may. What's tucked is tucked. 
</P>
<P>
And I'm not saying that certain people don't deserve special consideration. If 
the rumors that Jane Fonda had 'em enhanced are true, I say: More power to her. 
Jane's Fondas are part of a multimillion-dollar body industry. Jane can have 
'em. Linda Ellerbee can't. 
</P>
<P>
Let us all act now to stop the madness. Sign the following pledge and send it 
to me here at the Gonna Die Institute, c/o this newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Alice, 
</P>
<P>
I pledge not to have anything bobbed, lifted, tucked, augmented, suctioned, 
enhanced or de-love handled if you don't. 
</P>
<P>
Signed -- 
</P>
<P>
The important thing is that we're all in this together. Every good boomer must 
come to the aid of his generation. If anyone sneaks out and gets beautiful, 
then the pressure is on. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, plastic surgery is a trend. You know what happens when the baby boom 
combines with a trend? You've got a necessity. Like hula hoops and birth 
control pills and answering machines and VCRs and single-family homes and 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
If we all promise to fight the fad, we can grow old, fat and ugly together. 
Some people may want to eat oats and work out -- fine. That takes time, that 
takes effort. But no major medical, hospitalization or scars, please. 
</P>
<P>
Send in those pledges pronto. I've got an appointment to get my hair colorized 
next week. And I'm starting to pinch up the skin on my face and push it toward 
my forehead. I keep imagining how great my rear end would look glued to my 
earlobes. 
</P>
<P>
Let's just let it all hang out. I will if you will.

COMPOSER GETS 1 SHOT TO WIN OVER LISTENERS

Composer Charles Wuorinen is confident that avant-garde music only needs 
adequate exposure to win over reluctant listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"The question of acceptance depends on familiarity," he said. "After all, Bach 
and Beethoven wrote demanding music, but because it is played by devoted 
performers and taught in schools that value the music, ultimately, the complex 
and demanding becomes familiar. Their music is loved, even if it may not be 
understood." 
</P>
<P>
Wuorinen has but a single opportunity, however, to make his case to the San 
Diego Symphony audience Thursday evening at UC San Diego's Mandeville 
Auditorium. In the inaugural concert of the symphony's Pulitzer Series, the 
51-year-old New York composer will conduct a pair of his recent works as well 
as two Stravinsky compositions. 
</P>
<P>
At the expense of cultivating an adoring and understanding public, Wuorinen, 
who is often described as a second-generation 12-tone composer, has made 
"complex and demanding" his musical credo. Despite a prolific output -- about 
160 works in almost every musical medium -- he has never attracted the 
attention of such minimalist media darlings as Philip Glass and John Adams. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who write real music do not do it for the immediate satisfaction, 
but in the hope that it will last. That which is wildly popular will not last 
-- the more popular they are, the shorter their works will be around," Wuorinen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Not that he wishes to be known as a minimalist basher. 
</P>
<P>
"Minimalism is not the issue," he said. "My problem is this: A lot of music 
that is essentially pop music is now being declared to be serious music and 
played on programs with Beethoven, Mozart and yours truly. Entertainment is 
healthy in its place, but I object to confusing it with the higher arts." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that Wuorinen's non-stop flow of awards and prizes, starting at 
age 16 with the New York Philharmonic Young Composers Award, has forged such 
unwavering self-confidence. In 1970, while in his early 30s, he was the 
youngest composer to be awarded a Pulitzer Prize (and the first to receive one 
for a composition of electronic music), and in 1986 he won a megabuck MacArthur 
Foundation Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
If Wuorinen has been loathe to cultivate a personal following, he has regularly 
collaborated with major orchestras to keep his music before the public. Last 
year, Wuorinen completed a four-year residency with the San Francisco Symphony, 
where he also served as the orchestra's new-music adviser. He showered music 
director Herbert Blomstedt with praise for giving his compositions thorough 
preparation and first-rate performances. 
</P>
<P>
The orchestra also made a compact disc of Wuorinen's "The Golden Dance" and 
Third Piano Concerto, with Garrick Ohlsson as soloist. In January, 1989, the 
composer's only opera, "The W. of Babylon," was given its sole performance in a 
concert setting by the San Francisco Symphony. Subtitled a "Baroque Burlesque," 
the lascivious (according to local music critics) and satirical opera had been 
sitting on the shelf since its completion in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a happy relationship. I had a very good time while I was there, and our 
relationship will continue. I'm putting the final touches on a work for chorus 
and orchestra that San Francisco will be playing in March." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the time spent in San Francisco working with the symphony, the New 
York native did not discover a distinctly West Coast school of composition. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many different approaches -- the range of compositional style is 
so great. How would you put, say, Lou Harrison, John Adams and a Roger Reynolds 
in the same category? The cultural scene is so adrift, you begin to ask, 'Does 
anything mean anything?' " 
</P>
<P>
When Wuorinen ascends the Mandeville Auditorium podium to conduct "Bamboola 
Squared" for orchestra and quadraphonic tape, the piece will finally have come 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"The tape for 'Bamboola Squared' was produced and realized at the university's 
Center for Music Experiment laboratory. The piece was written for the New York 
Philharmonic's 1984 Horizons Festival, which (UCSD professor) Roger Reynolds 
and I co-produced." (Reynolds' music will be featured on the San Diego 
Symphony's next Pulitzer Series program on Feb. 15 at UCSD.) 
</P>
<P>
Although Wuorinen asked the center to retool the tape portion of "Bamboola 
Squared" in the latest electronic technology -- magneto-optical hard disc -- 
for this performance with the San Diego Symphony, the center's wizards could 
not comply. 
</P>
<P>
"The new technology is not as reliable in performance, say, as a clarinet," 
said the centerspokesman, John Lauer. "But we did recompute the file that 
Wuorinen left when he first made the tape in '84 and freshened it up a bit." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday's program, Wuorinen will also conduct his 1988 "Machault, mon 
chou," one of the works written for the San Francisco Symphony and dedicated to 
Blomstedt. The Stravinsky pieces will be "Dumbarton Oaks" Concerto and 
"Monumentum pro Gesualdo di Venosa."

'UNCLE VANYA' STIRS MEMORIES FOR O'BRIEN;

THEATER: THE OLD GLOBE'S ARTISTIC DIRECTOR IS FULFILLING A LONGTIME DREAM BY 
DIRECTING A CHEKHOV PLAY, BUT IT IS A SWEET AND SOUR FEELING.

<P>
Remembering sadness in the happiest of times. If it seems like a Chekhovian 
concept, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
Jack O'Brien, artistic director of the Old Globe, is fulfilling a longtime 
dream of directing Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" on the main stage of his theater. 
</P>
<P>
The playwright is new to O'Brien's repertoire, and anticipation of the run, 
which begins Thursday with several of his favorite actors, fills the 
50-year-old director with unmitigated delight. But the sad and silly characters 
in "Uncle Vanya" also evoke memories of a dark time, when O'Brien turned his 
back on Broadway to take up the reins of the Old Globe, at a time when San 
Diego theater was the kind of credit that no respectable New York theater 
artist would deign to put on his resume. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came to San Diego in 1981, with a few exceptions, it was still worth a 
laugh to my friends from the East Coast," O'Brien recalled in his Old Globe 
office. 
</P>
<P>
" 'You're going where?' they said. 'To do what?' And then they'd apologize. 
'Oh, I'm sorry. I guess they do good Shakespeare there. But if you want to do 
some serious theater, why not go to L.A.?' " 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe, then under the artistic leadership of Craig Noel (now continuing 
as executive producer), beckoned invitingly to O'Brien as a relatively 
unpressured environment where art could be nurtured, away from the glare of New 
York critics. O'Brien had had his directorial successes, most notably with the 
acclaimed revival of "Porgy and Bess." But in 1980, his musical, "Most Happy 
Fella," closed after just six weeks on Broadway, and he 
</P>
<P>
was fired from the Los Angeles and Broadway productions of "I Ought to Be in 
Pictures" by Neil Simon himself. 
</P>
<P>
His "altercation" with Simon, as he calls it, prompts him into a comparison of 
himself with Astrov in "Uncle Vanya." He suggested that some of the differences 
between him and Simon resulted from the two being at critically different 
stages of life then. The rift has since been reconciled, and the Old Globe is 
presenting its second Simon world premiere, "Jake's Women," in March. 
</P>
<P>
"In 'Uncle Vanya,' Astrov is approaching his 40s and Vanya is approaching his 
50s," O'Brien said. "This is not a small and insignificant detail in the life 
of these characters. The 40s is a career crisis -- a crisis of belief. The 50s 
crisis is a mortality crisis -- will she love me again? Will anyone love me 
again? When I came to the Globe, I was in Astrov's shoes. I was asking myself, 
'Do I want to be Hal Prince, Tyrone Guthrie or Craig Noel?' -- all very 
different people. And if I don't choose to be any of these people, how do I let 
the person within out? Maybe somebody will sincerely want to be Jack O'Brien 
someday. I pity him, but there you have it," he said with a wry half-smile. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien sidestepped any attempts to identify Simon with Vanya. Simon, however, 
was at an interesting stage in his life at the time of the firing. "I Ought to 
Be in Pictures" was the last play by the old, flip Simon, before he produced 
the darker, harder-hitting comedy of his semi-autobiographical trilogy, 
"Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues" and "Broadway Bound." It was also not 
long before he separated from and later divorced Marsha Mason, his second wife, 
who had been one of O'Brien's closest friends for 20 years at that point. 
</P>
<P>
"When Neil and I had our altercation, it was as boring as you might imagine," 
O'Brien said. "He was digging in. I was digging out. Neil is enormously 
successful because he has perfected a code of ethics, a modus vivendi that 
practically no one else in the world can use. He's unique. The best way of 
dealing with Neil is on his terms. He has a 25-year track record. I was a 
family friend, and, subsequent to my success in 'Porgy and Bess,' he was 
fascinated to find a man with such sensibilities sitting across from him at his 
breakfast table. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in my heart right now that Neil loves me as a colleague but doesn't 
think I can play his music. As a director, I believe I can direct anything. To 
be successful, you've got to have enough chutzpah to say, 'I can do anything.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
But until Simon agrees with O'Brien's assessment, you will see guest directors 
handling the Simon repertoire at the Old Globe: Gene Saks did "Rumors," the 
1988 Globe premiere that went on to Broadway; Ron Link will direct "Jake's 
Women." 
</P>
<P>
And O'Brien seems happy to see the relationship between Simon and his theater 
continue on those terms. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the scar, I've always adored him. Even when he was firing me, I 
found him artistically fascinating. And now we are growing closer together. His 
trilogy is closer to my dimension than 'I Ought to Be in Pictures' was. After 
10 years of collective growth, we find ourselves over dinner and I see him as 
the preeminent playwright of his generation, growing and taking chances. He 
sees me as someone running one of the most successful regional theaters in the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, at the helm of that successful regional theater, O'Brien is 
flexing his muscles with new challenges like "Uncle Vanya." Part of what 
attracted him was the opportunity to work with actors he admires; he refers to 
the ones in this ensemble -- Jonathan McMurtry, Katherine McGrath, Byron 
Jennings, Lynne Griffin, Richard Easton, Richard Kneeland, Caroline McCormick 
and Patricia Fraser -- as "the best American actors extant right now." 
</P>
<P>
He is grateful to the actors for taking supporting roles; all of them have been 
headliners for the theater in the past. Watching them in rehearsal has been 
cathartic for O'Brien, reminding him why he wanted to work at the Old Globe in 
the first place. At one recent rehearsal he found himself crying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The tears started to pour down my face because I thought, 'This is what you 
wanted all your life,' " O'Brien said. "What I wanted was not fame or money, 
but the people. I wanted the society of artists. I wanted to be able to mix it 
up with the greatest jazz musicians of the stage in a riotous improvisation, 
which is what I'm doing. So how could I possibly not feel at home?" 
</P>
<P>
The Old Globe has come a long way under the triumvirate leadership of O'Brien, 
Noel and Managing Director Thomas Hall, which began in 1981. The theater that 
O'Brien's friends laughed at nine years ago, the theater that couldn't get 
Broadway producers to come out and take a look at Stephen Metcalfe's "Emily" in 
1986, now has what New York producer Thomas Viertel two years ago called "the 
hot theater hand" in the country. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the Old Globe originated four plays that went to New York -- "Rumors," 
"Into the Woods," "The Cocktail Hour" and "Suds." In recent years it has also 
presented the West Coast premiere of Broadway-bound shows such as "Joe Turner's 
Come and Gone" and "The Piano Lesson." Even "The Kathy &amp; Mo Show" played 
here before it went off-Broadway, where it's still running. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare continues to be a summer presence even as new work percolates. 
Director Lloyd Richards is coming to town to direct the West Coast premiere of 
Lee Blessing's "Cobb," sometime after Richards directs August Wilson's "The 
Piano Lesson" for Broadway in April. Recently the Old Globe had an in-house 
reading of a new Stephen Metcalfe play. On the horizon is a new musical being 
commissioned based on "Death and the Blacksmith," a discovery of the Globe's 
Teatro Meta Latino Play Discovery Series, directed in 1989 by Noel, and the 
English translation of the sequel to "Brothers and Sisters," a Maly State Drama 
Theatre production to be produced by the Globe in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
But with success comes problems, and they threaten to bring regional theater 
full circle to the pressures that spurred O'Brien to escape New York in 1981. 
Government grants are shrinking. Competing theaters "are breathing down our 
necks and we're breathing down theirs," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the La Jolla Playhouse and the San Diego Repertory Theatre 
seasons in May have caused the Old Globe to push its summer season back a full 
month to June. ("It's cold out here in May," he explained.) 
</P>
<P>
"We have to keep making hits. People expect it," O'Brien said. But when the 
theater gets hits, the pressure increases for other groups to get a piece of a 
pie that O'Brien argues looks bigger than it is. 
</P>
<P>
The Dramatists Guild asked for a contract last year that would deny regional 
theaters the right to profit from future New York runs of the shows they 
premiere. (The Old Globe refused to go along.) The Society of Stage Directors 
and Choreographers argued for more money. The Old Globe budget may have jumped 
from $1.2 million for 13 plays in 1981 (when O'Brien's tenure began) to $8.2 
million in 1990 for a 12-play season, but how much money is left when the 
season is said and done? 
</P>
<P>
On the books, it is about $100,000, O'Brien acknowledged, but it exists more as 
"a trick of the ledger" than as money in the hand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't find it anywhere. Can you?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the good old days," O'Brien said, sounding mournfully Chekhovian 
again, as though he were a character in "The Cherry Orchard," hearing the 
sounds of trees being felled in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"Like any resource, we have a limited time span here. We must all be grateful 
that we are here now, but it's going to get caught up very quickly with the 
economics that follow success. When the lawyers come in and the arbitrators, it 
is the beginning of the end. There is no doubt about it. It's not about the 
passion and enthusiasm anymore; it becomes about the bottom line and the deal. 
If I have sleepless nights, that's what causes them.

'Today' Picking New Boss: With Deborah Norville debuting in Jane Pauley's place 
on NBC's "Today" show this week, the network was also selecting a new boss for 
the series. Top candidates reportedly included Tom Capra, the news director who 
led KNBC Channel 4 to the top of the ratings; Steve Friedman, former head of 
"Today"; and the series' current executive producer, Marty Ryan. The job opened 
up when negotiations between "Entertainment Tonight" producer David Nuell and 
"Today" fell through. SHAUNA SNOW

Eagles Won't Fly: The Eagles, the band that defined the hugely popular 
"California sound" in the '70s, isn't planning a reunion despite a report 
Monday in the Hollywood Reporter. A source close to several ex-Eagles branded 
as "inconceivable" a full-scale reunion by the group, which broke up amid 
considerable bitterness in 1982. The source suggested speculation about a 
reuniting may have been triggered by former Eagles leaders Glenn Frey and Don 
Henley appearing on stage together last fall during two Henley concerts in 
Southern California and by Henley's subsequent comments that the two may 
occasionally write songs together again. SHAUNA SNOW

'MURDER AT THE HOWARD JOHNSON'S' LIKE A TV SKIT -- A LONG ONE AT THAT

"Murder at the Howard Johnson's" has the feel of a television comedy skit -- a 
very long television comedy skit. 
</P>
<P>
This full-length Ron Clark/Sam Bobrick farce is reminiscent of Carol Burnett -- 
you know, Carol doing her thing while Tim Conway or one of her other leading 
men pratfalls all over the place. Burnett could have done the same bit in 10 
minutes, but here it's overextended to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Murder," now performed by the San Clemente Community Theater at the Cabrillo 
Playhouse, gives us Arlene and Paul and Mitchell, slow thinkers whose thoughts 
linger on romance and murder. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene and Paul are deadlocked in a bad marriage (she's a hyper-sexed ditz, 
he's a monotone bore). Mitchell is their womanizing dentist. He's also Arlene's 
lover, an overactive type who wears alarmingly loud clothes. 
</P>
<P>
She wants a divorce, but Paul refuses. That spells trouble, so Mitchell and 
Arlene decide to kill him in a nondescript room at the Howard Johnson's. Give 
some credit to Douglas Hartman; his modest set has the motel's look down, from 
the chintzy lamps to the crummy wall art. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell and Arlene's plans don't work out, of course, because there are 
minutes upon minutes to fill before this baby is put to rest. All three get on 
each other's nerves something terrible, and it's safe to say that, at one time 
or another, each becomes the murder target as alliances shift. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, "Murder" is sort of amusing, in a let's-moon-the-audience kind 
of way, but it gets weary after the first scene. The humor becomes strenuous, 
primarily because of the plot's limitations. The basic premise doesn't leave a 
lot of room, and the main gag keeps getting repeated. How many times are we 
supposed to laugh at the idea of bumping off a loved one who annoys us? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, director B.J. Scott does make a few comic impressions here and there. 
She has Mitchell put on his starched dentist's smock as preparation to the 
actual messiness of murder, and that's funny, as is the wobbly gallows that's 
erected on stage for the final scene. 
</P>
<P>
The cast is also game, despite some overreaching. Laura Hoffman's Arlene is 
dizzy enough to be influenced by every passing emotion, and Tom Klein's 
Mitchell is, as Paul keeps telling everybody, just a big baby. As for Paul, Ron 
Lance gives him a befuddled air. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD: BAND TO PLAY HEARTS OUT TO

Robert Vaughn is no stranger to benefit concerts. Since his 1980 release from a 
drug-rehabilitation program, the Point Loma rock 'n' roller and his band, the 
Shadows, have been doing twice-yearly benefit shows for the local chapter of 
Narcotics Anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
The Shadows' July, 1987, record-preview party at the Radisson Hotel ballroom in 
Mission Valley -- celebrating the release of the group's debut Island Records 
album, "Love and War" -- raised $5,000 for a 3-year-old leukemia patient. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Vaughn and his band will throw another benefit concert, at the 
Doubletree Hotel ballroom in Mission Valley. This time, the beneficiary is 
Vaughn's own son, 5-year-old David, scheduled to undergo open-heart surgery in 
June to correct a birth defect and a hole in the center of his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Coincidentally, I found out about it (his son's condition) the same day I did 
the benefit for the little girl with leukemia," Vaughn said. "Now that a 
surgery date has finally been set, we need to do something, because it's a 
pre-existing condition, and we didn't have any insurance at the time he was 
born." 
</P>
<P>
Sharing the bill with Robert Vaughn and the Shadows will be two fellow Point 
Loma bands, Fair Warning and Liquid Solution. Tickets to the concert are $10. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I don't expect to raise anywhere near the $65,000," said Vaughn, 
referring to the cost of the operation and post-operative treatment. "I'm 
contacting California Childrens Services and other charity organizations for 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
"But being in a band, I feel I'm in a somewhat privileged position to raise at 
least some of the money myself." 
</P>
<P>
With very few exceptions, San Diego bands -- particularly those that play 
originals rather than Top 40 covers -- don't make nearly enough money plying 
the bar scene. The only way to make ends meet is by moonlighting. Here are some 
prominent local musicians, and their day jobs:

LINER NOTES: The Beat Farmers are working on a book that should prove an 
invaluable traveling companion for touring bands, particularly novices. "The 
Beat Farmers' Bowl Report" is a guide to public restrooms -- at gas stations, 
truck stops, rest areas and greasy spoons -- encountered by the local roots 
rockers on their last few U.S. tours. Facilities are rated in a number of 
categories, including: quality of graffiti, privacy, cleanliness, acoustics, 
condiments (toilet paper, seat covers, etc.), and condition of seat. No 
publication date has been set. "It may take a couple more years of 
investigative work, but it's coming along," said Beat Farmers drummer Country 
Dick Montana. "Right now, we've already got about 150 (restrooms) rated." . . .

MINISTER WHO LET MOLESTER WORK WITH TEENS RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hermosa Beach minister resigned his post Tuesday, accepting the blame for 
allowing a Greek Orthodox priest, who last week was charged with sexual 
assault, to counsel a church youth group for the last five months. 
</P>
<P>
Father Richard E. Wescott announced in a letter to the church's rector his 
intention to leave St. Cross Episcopal Church, where he had served as second in 
command for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
Wescott said in an interview Tuesday that he had been "foolish" when he let 
Stanley Adamakis, the Orthodox priest, counsel teen-agers in the St. Cross 
youth group. 
</P>
<P>
Felony sexual battery charges were filed against Adamakis, who had been 
previously convicted of child molestation, after an 18-year-old told police 
that he was molested by Adamakis on Dec. 17. The teen-ager and two other young 
men were house-sitting at a home on the Strand in Hermosa Beach, and Adamakis 
was acting as a chaperon when the incident occurred, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis, 47, has declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, through my foolishness of not being able to discern what Stanley 
(Adamakis) was all about, that I have had a part in hurting a number of 
people," Wescott said. "I feel badly about that. That is the understatement of 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
Wescott, the supervisor of the church youth group, said he met Adamakis in the 
early 1980s. The two worked as counselors at a psychiatric and drug 
rehabilitation center in the San Fernando Valley and kept in touch when they 
moved on to other jobs, Wescott said. 
</P>
<P>
Wescott said that when he moved into a church-owned home next to St. Cross in 
late 1988, he let Adamakis rent the home's garage apartment. Adamakis was out 
of work and could not afford his apartment in the San Fernando Valley, Wescott 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to help somebody, a fellow priest, who was down on his luck," 
Wescott said. 
</P>
<P>
Wescott characterized Adamakis as sometimes disagreeable and said he had 
occasionally challenged Wescott's authority as supervisor of the youth group. 
But Wescott said he wanted to avoid a confrontation with Adamakis and allowed 
him to continue counseling the teen-agers because they liked him. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Wescott said, he wishes he had asked Adamakis to move on. 
</P>
<P>
Adamakis pleaded guilty in 1986 to molesting two brothers, ages 12 and 13, and 
served 78 days in Los Angeles County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, a Greek Orthodox bishop said that an action to unfrock 
Adamakis is pending because of repeated, although never substantiated, 
accusations of sexual misbehavior. Adamakis was ordained as a Greek Orthodox 
priest at least 15 years ago, the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their long acquaintance, Wescott said he had not known about either 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had known anything about any of that, I wouldn't have brought him by 
here," Wescott said. "I knew nothing of that." 
</P>
<P>
Wescott will meet Friday with Bishop Frederick H. Borsch of the Episcopal 
Diocese of Los Angeles to discuss his next assignment. The 56-year-old priest 
does not face disciplinary action, a diocesan spokesman said.

LONGER BAN ON AMMUNITION SALES PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Los Angeles City Council members suggested Tuesday that a proposed ban on 
the sale of ammunition for one week prior to New Year's Eve and the Fourth of 
July be expanded to as long as one month. 
</P>
<P>
The one-week ban, proposed last week by Mayor Tom Bradley and two council 
members, failed to win enough votes Tuesday for emergency passage and as a 
result was sent to a committee for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is an attempt to cut down on the deliberate firing of guns into the 
air that has become a holiday tradition in Los Angeles. Despite the proposal's 
failure Tuesday, council members predicted that it will pass in some form and 
be in effect by the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
"A week doesn't seem like long enough," said City Council President John 
Ferraro, who voted against the proposal. Ferraro said he may support a ban of 
as long as a month, but first wants the proposal to be discussed in a committee 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was defeated by an 8-3 vote. Ten votes were necessary for passage. 
Councilmen Nate Holden and Hal Bernson also voted against the ban, suggesting 
later to reporters that a ban of several weeks or a month may be more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
"I may well support a ban when it comes out of committee, but I think it's big 
enough that it deserves a full hearing," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
Holden said that if a one-week ban would be effective, "there will be more 
effect by a cutoff of two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
If a ban is approved, Los Angeles would be the first city in the country to 
have one, according to Bradley's office. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Chandler, the mayor's press secretary, said Tuesday that if the city 
attorney's office determines that a ban of longer than a week is legally 
defensible, "the mayor is all for it." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy City Atty. John Emerson said Tuesday that a longer ban probably would be 
legal, but if the measure is too extreme the state Legislature probably will 
pass a law preempting it. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Joel Wachs predicted Tuesday that the council will pass something 
that is "reasonable," but said it is important that a measure be passed quickly 
so that other cities in the area will follow suit in time for the Fourth of 
July. 
</P>
<P>
"You really can't wait until the last minute," Wachs said. "It will be less 
effective if others don't follow it." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is studying a similar plan. 
Supervisor Kenneth Hahn introduced a motion that would ban the sale of 
ammunition for one week prior to the News Year's Eve and July 4 holidays. On 
Tuesday the board agreed to send the proposal to County Sheriff Sherman Block 
and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates for comment.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY, 14, SHOT TO DEATH IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 14-year-old boy was shot to death and a 19-year-old man was wounded Tuesday 
afternoon in a drive-by shooting at a Santa Fe Springs park. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting, which sheriff's investigators said may be gang-related, occurred 
about 3:30 p.m. at Little Lake Park after an argument between a group of 
teen-agers and a carload of men cruising past. Following the verbal 
altercation, witnesses and investigators said, the people in the car pulled a 
gun from beneath the hood of their vehicle and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-year-old was shot in the chest, and the other victim was wounded in the 
leg. Names of the victims were withheld pending notification of relatives.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: L.A. VIOLATED CABLE FIRM'S RIGHTS, U.S. 
JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal judge has ruled that the cable television franchising system set up 
by the city of Los Angeles violated the 1st Amendment rights of a company that 
sought a franchise in 1983, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
In a decision released last week, U.S. District Court Judge Consuelo Marshall 
ruled that the city had violated Preferred Communications' 1st Amendment right 
to offer service to city residents. 
</P>
<P>
In the ruling, Marshall invalidated the city's requirement that cable 
television companies provide public access channels and a minimum channel 
capacity, said Rob Bramson, an attorney for Preferred Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Company attorneys hailed the decision as having nationwide importance by 
further limiting the control that cities have over cable television. But an 
attorney for the city, Larrine S. Holbrooke, said that outside California 
federal judges have tended to favor the right of a city to franchise cable 
television.

MURDER, ROBBERY HEAD LIST AS L.A. CRIME RISES 8.2%; 
</P>
<P>
VIOLENCE: THE INCREASE WAS SPURRED BY DRUG TRAFFICKING, POLICE SAY. A 
DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN CALLS THE LEVEL OF MAJOR OFFENSES INTOLERABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robbery and murder led an 8.2% spurt in major crimes in Los Angeles last year, 
a level of lawbreaking and violence -- spurred by narcotics trafficking -- that 
a Police Department spokesman described as intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
The department's summary of crimes committed between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31 last 
year reports that 324,486 major crimes were committed in the city, compared to 
299,910 for the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Crime is at an intolerable level here, just as it is in major cities across 
the nation," police spokesman Cmdr. William Booth said. 
</P>
<P>
Robberies zoomed 18.7%, totaling 30,705 in 1989, compared to 25,863 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The number of homicides -- up 17.2% -- totaled 873 last year, compared to 745 
in 1988. There were 834 murders in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Booth blamed illegal drugs for exacerbating the crime problem. 
</P>
<P>
Police Department analysis indicates that narcotics trafficking is involved in 
about half of the murders, robberies, burglaries and aggravated assaults, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rape was down slightly in the city during 1989, when compared to the year 
before. Police reported 1,993 sexual assaults last year, a 0.3% drop from the 
1,999 rapes recorded in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In other categories of major crimes, the department reported that aggravated 
assaults rose from 38,102 in 1988 to 43,647 in 1989, an increase of 12.7%; 
burglaries from homes and businesses were up by 0.3% from 51,006 in 1988 to 
51,182 last year; thefts from automobiles were up 4.7% from 13,891 in 1988 to 
14,549 in 1989, and thefts from persons dropped 0.2% from 4,739 to 4,645. 
</P>
<P>
Crime increased in all of the LAPD's divisions in 1989, but Rampart Division 
recorded the highest jump, with a 19.9% hike in overall lawbreaking. The number 
of murders there climbed from 62 in 1988 to 105 last year. 
</P>
<P>
Central Division downtown reported a 0.7% increase in crime, the lowest in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Despite last year's statistics, however, Booth offered hope for the 1990s. The 
public is "very aroused and very aware" of the problems created by drugs, he 
said. "In the 1990s, we are going to get a handle on narcotics problems." 
</P>
<P>
Booth noted that last year the LAPD erected barricades around a square-mile 
section of the Pico-Union area near MacArthur Park and stationed uniformed 
officers at most street entrances in an effort to rid the area of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Andy Cicioria, head of the homicide detail at Rampart, estimated it will be 
several months before police know whether drug sales will be affected by 
blocking off streets in the division. 
</P>
<P>
Booth said that, if recruiting proceeds as planned, the LAPD, which is 
authorized to have 8,414 uniformed officers by the middle of this year, will 
grow to a force of 10,000 in three years.

TENSION RISES AS MCMARTIN CASE JURORS NEAR END OF THEIR TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS TIMNICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the final countdown begins in the record-breaking McMartin Pre-School 
molestation trial, both participants and observers are getting edgy, mentally 
ticking off the counts on which the jury has reached verdicts and the dwindling 
number left to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm relieved that we're this close but still apprehensive," Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge William Pounders said Tuesday. "Until the last act is 
over, it's not over. And I want it to be over as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
The trial, once measured in years, then months and weeks, is now days away from 
completion, with all sides agreeing that the jury will finish this month if it 
maintains its current pace. 
</P>
<P>
As they await the outcome, parents of children in the case say they fluctuate 
between optimism and nervousness. 
</P>
<P>
"The closer it gets, the more nervous I get," said one, who asked not to be 
identified. "And whether we win or lose, I know I'm going to cry anyway" that 
it's finally over. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, are charged with 64 
counts of molestation and a shared count of conspiracy involving 11 children 
who attended their family-run nursery school in Manhattan Beach between 1978 
and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters were on hand and applauded when the eight-man, four-woman panel 
returned from a two-week holiday vacation last week, counting as each juror 
entered the courtroom. After six weeks of deliberations, the jury had turned in 
26 verdicts before leaving on their break, but had asked the judge not to 
unseal them, contending that piecemeal announcements would affect their 
deliberations and put pressure on them from outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
Pounders agreed, even though the loss of one juror before the verdicts are 
announced and affirmed in court, could result in a mistrial and a waste of more 
than $15 million in county funds. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the jury reached decisions on eight more counts, passing the halfway 
mark in their work. As of Tuesday, they had decided 34 of 66 verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly Pounders' courtroom -- newly relocated from the 15th floor to the 
ninth floor of the downtown Criminal Courts Building -- is usually empty of 
McMartin participants, but for the jurors trooping in and out under the 
watchful eye of bailiff Jim Gilpin. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating the day that the verdicts are read, a television network and a 
local station have hired people to sit in the courtroom and wait for 
developments. The network has also installed a special telephone hot line from 
the nearby pressroom to its main office. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Pounders proceeds with other trials in his courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of the crowds that characterized the early days of the 
trial nearly three years ago, hundreds of lives are literally on hold until the 
deliberations end -- those of the judge, the attorneys, the families, the 
defendants and media people assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's being in closer touch," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin when 
asked about inquiries from parents of children who testified. "One family 
called and said they were planning a trip at the end of January but didn't want 
to be away when the verdicts were announced. They were wondering if I had a 
crystal ball." 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor said that while she has been "confident all along that we'd 
continue to have 12 jurors who would ultimately render their judgment," she 
became concerned during the Christmas break that one might be lost. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big relief to me to know that all 12 came back and have been busy at 
work," she said. She added that unlike the other lawyers -- co-prosecutor Roger 
Gunson, who now heads the district attorney's special investigations division,

WARRANT ISSUED FOR GALLERY HEAD; 
</P>
<P>
ART FRAUD: HE'S CHARGED IN A SCUFFLE WITH TWO DISGRUNTLED ART BUYERS WHO 
DISCOVERED THAT THEIR LITHOGRAPH WAS A FAKE.

Beverly Hills police have issued an arrest warrant for Upstairs Gallery 
President William B. McKelvey Jr. in connection with an alleged assault on two 
disgruntled art collectors who picketed the gallery's Rodeo Drive branch after 
discovering that a $3,200 Joan Miro lithograph they bought was a fake. 
</P>
<P>
The warrant for the arrest of McKelvey on charges of misdemeanor battery and 
disturbing the peace in the Dec. 8 scuffle with collectors Stuart Herman and 
Cynthia Berliner was issued last Friday, said Police Lt. Robert Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis said McKelvey has been contacted and is expected to surrender for 
booking this week. McKelvey could not be reached for comment Tuesday but 
earlier had denied any wrongdoing in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Warrants also have been issued for the arrest of James G. Lykes, a gallery 
salesman, and Robert Kent, husband of an artist displaying her work at the 
gallery, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
McKelvey's Upstairs Gallery chain is the subject of a major art fraud 
investigation by local and federal authorities. In September, authorities 
seized 1,685 allegedly fraudulent works from various Upstairs Gallery 
locations. Prosecutors have filed grand theft charges against the former 
manager of the company's Beverly Hills branch in the ongoing investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The company has denied any wrongdoing in the fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
McKelvey reportedly told police that a scuffle involving the couple started 
after they damaged a car parked outside the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview, Upstairs Gallery attorney Charles Tillinghast said, "I 
don't believe any of our people assaulted them." 
</P>
<P>
But Herman said he and his wife were set upon by McKelvey and the other men as 
the couple held up a picket sign and passed out flyers criticizing the gallery. 
Herman said he was bitten on the hand during the fight and his wife was thrown 
to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We were shocked," said Herman, a 48-year-old clothier from Encino. "We thought 
they might be upset by the fact we were there, but we did not expect them to 
come out and engage us in combat." 
</P>
<P>
The couple's relationship with the Upstairs Gallery chain dates back to their 
December, 1987, purchase of a Joan Miro lithograph that was later judged to be 
phony by their art appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
Gallery executives said they offered to refund the couple's original payment of 
$3,200 plus interest if the company's own Miro specialist supported the 
finding, but the Hermans chose not to wait. 
</P>
<P>
They took their case to small claims court Dec. 5 where a judge awarded them 
the maximum $2,000 allowed under law despite Upstairs Gallery's contention that 
the work was authentic. 
</P>
<P>
Herman said he and his wife decided to picket the gallery Dec. 8 to let others 
know of their experience. 
</P>
<P>
Their 7:30 p.m. appearance on the sidewalk outside the gallery coincided with 
an opening being held for artist Melanie Taylor Kent. Herman said he and his 
wife had been there about five minutes when the men from the gallery confronted 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Herman claims that McKelvey broke his wife's picket sign and cursed at her 
while another man pushed him. But Herman said the couple held their ground. He 
said the men then walked back inside the gallery, only to return a few minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
"They walked up to us three abreast and attempted to bowl us over," Herman 
said. "There were more vulgarities and they said that we'd better get the hell 
out of there." 
</P>
<P>
Two police squad cars arrived at the scene about five minutes after the 
incident began.

THAW IN EAST EUROPE FINDS NO WARM SPOT IN COL. NORTH'S HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a comfort to know that in an astonishing world where political tornadoes 
have swept from Eastern Europe to Panama in the span of half a year, some 
things do not change. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver L. North, among them. 
</P>
<P>
That sturdy foe of all manner of communists, and the retired Marine officer 
convicted of shredding government documents in the Iran-Contra contretemps, 
North was playing the same tune when he took the lectern Tuesday before 
hundreds of members of the Hollywood Radio and Television Society at its 
Newsmakers Luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
Be wary, he warned. Be alert. Soviet arms are still reaching Nicaragua. Soviet 
"affection" is still reaching Libya and Syria. "The American people understand 
well that the musician in Moscow has changed. They also know that while the 
lyrics are new, the song is not -- in other words, Gorbachev is saying one 
thing and doing another," said North, his hair grayer, his posture no less 
Marine-like in a suit of dark blue civvies. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that the world is better today because Gorbachev was declared 
by Time magazine to be Man of the Decade. I will not believe that the changes 
that have occurred in Eastern Europe are the result of his control of events, 
because I believe what he has done is take credit for those things he could not 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 That made them look up from their fruit custard tarts. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised me -- it's the first time I've heard anyone espouse that point of 
view," acknowledged Scott Siegler, president of television at Columbia 
Pictures. "But then, I'm not used to hearing a right-wing speaker." 
</P>
<P>
Not since October, when Ronald Reagan, North's former boss and the man he tried 
unsuccessfully to summon to testify at his trial, spoke to this same group and 
apologized for defending Sony Corp.'s purchase of Columbia Pictures by saying 
Hollywood should look to Japan to bring "decency and good taste" back to 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
North waived his speaking fee -- at last report $25,000 -- as had Reagan, Lee 
Iacocca and others before him. This was a freebie in exchange for an 
influential audience with Hollywood's billion-dollar power people. 
</P>
<P>
Familiarly, they called him "Ollie" in their news releases, and why not? As 
congressional witness and the subject of a miniseries, he ran longer on their 
networks than a second-generation sitcom spinoff. In return, North, whose house 
was for months the site of a reporters' camp-out jamboree, acknowledged his 
audience with droll jokes: His security men, he said, were "deeply concerned 
that behind me are members of the Fourth Estate, and I'm not wearing my armor 
vest." 
</P>
<P>
And then, with the earnest vibrato of a stump speech, North sounded the basso 
profundo of the 1st Amendment, applauding the media as "an absolutely vital 
platform for disseminating the truth. I would not be here today knowing that I 
have the support and the prayers of millions of Americans if I had not had the 
opportunity to state my case and tell truth as I know it." 
</P>
<P>
He wove that silkily into twinned themes of anti-communism and a need for an 
American reassertion of the Marine motto "semper fidelis," faithfulness in a 
commitment on issues from drugs to morality. 
</P>
<P>
In summing up for his media audience, North slightly misquoted Abraham Lincoln. 
Lincoln, said North, called America "the world's last, great hope." Lincoln 
actually called it "the last, best hope of Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, afterward, Siegler waited for his car. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Ronald Reagan's a better performer," he said. "I also thought that 
Reagan's material was better." 
</P>
<P>
Tough house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Oliver L. North was convicted last year of felonies stemming from his 
Iran-Contra activities, including obstructing Congress, taking an illegal 
gratuity from a confederate, and unlawfully mutilating government documents. He 
was given a three-year suspended sentence, fined $150,000, and ordered to 
perform community service. The case is on appeal. The U.S. Senate voted to 
allow the retired Marine lieutenant colonel to receive his annual pension in 
spite of the conviction.

PENTAGON PUTS PANAMA CIVILIAN DEATHS AT 220; 
</P>
<P>
INVASION: ESTIMATE SUGGESTS 10 DIED FOR EACH U.S. SOLDIER WHO FELL. DEFENSE 
FORCES LOSSES ARE PUT AT 314.

<P>
The Pentagon, in its first accounting of non-military casualties in last 
month's U.S. invasion of Panama, said Tuesday that about 220 Panamanian 
civilians were killed in the fighting that followed the assault by 27,000 
American troops. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Pentagon estimated that 314 members of the Panama Defense 
Forces were killed. 
</P>
<P>
The estimate of civilian deaths, which is almost certain to add new fuel to the 
controversy over the cost of the U.S. action, suggests that almost 10 
Panamanian civilians died for each of the 23 U.S. soldiers who were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Robert Hall disputed estimates that have placed the number 
of killed Panamanian civilians as high as 1,200. He noted that the American 
estimate of 220 was slightly higher than the 203 estimated by the Panamanian 
Institute for Legal Medicine, which records and investigates all suspicious or 
violent deaths in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and the institute's estimates included victims who may have been 
looters, out-of-uniform members of the Panama Defense Forces or those belonging 
to Gen. Manuel A. Noriega's armed "Dignity Battalions." 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot guarantee to you that they were all civilians," State Department 
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said. "If it was a PDF member in civilian clothes 
. . . that has not been sorted out." 
</P>
<P>
In reaching their estimate, American military investigators visited civilian 
hospitals and relief agencies and reviewed death records of Panamanian 
civilians since Dec. 20, when the invasion began. 
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said they were confident that independent estimates would 
support the Pentagon's count. The Panamanian Red Cross is investigating the 
numbers of civilian deaths and casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The highest estimate came from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who alleged in a 
television interview Monday that the United States had killed 1,200 persons. 
Many of them, he said, were buried in mass graves. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson did not say where his estimate came from, but a spokesman later said 
that the data had been provided by the New York-based Caribbean Action Lobby, 
which canvassed Panamanian funeral homes and hospitals. Efforts to reach 
officials of the group Tuesday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the State and Defense departments said they could not determine 
whether the Panamanian civilians were killed by U.S. or Panamanian troops. But 
Pentagon officials and returning soldiers said that U.S. forces operated under 
orders designed to minimize the numbers of civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
One Administration source said, for instance, that planners of the operation 
prohibited the use of "indirect-fire weapons," which lob their ordnance over 
longer distances but with uncertain accuracy. Only the AC-130 gunship, an 
aircraft that fires at ground targets with high accuracy, was authorized to 
initiate fire against such targets, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The strictures also included "rules of engagement" that most soldiers 
interpreted to mean that they must be shot at before they could open fire on 
Panamanians in or out of uniform. 
</P>
<P>
"We were briefed once, and the (guidelines) were too broad," said Sgt. Kenneth 
Jeffries, an artilleryman with the 7th Light Infantry Division who returned 
earlier this week from Panama to his home base at Ft. Ord, Calif. "You let 
yourself get shot (at) first before you shot back, if you wanted to make sure 
you didn't go to jail. If we had been in heavy firing, I think my unit would 
have been in some trouble." 
</P>
<P>
In one instance, defense officials said that a young Army Ranger burst into a 
roomful of unarmed Panama Defense Forces recruits and held fire long enough to 
ascertain that none of the frightened troops were armed. 
</P>
<P>
In other instances, soldiers said that isolated snipers hid among crowds of 
Panamanian well-wishers and shot at U.S. convoys as they passed. The U.S. 
troops were told they could not return fire under such conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told if we felt we were in danger and there was no alternative, we 
could use what force was needed," said Spec. 4 Charlie Harris, a paratrooper 
who returned Monday to Ft. Bragg, N.C. "But everybody out there was nervous; it 
was an urban area. A lot of guys got out and shot first, asked questions 
later." 
</P>
<P>
Although Harris said he knew of one case in which a Panamanian was mistakenly 
shot, he added that U.S. troops were more often injured as a result of the 
inexperience of many of their comrades. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of friendly fire," Harris said. "A couple of guys got hit." 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said the United States intends to compensate the Panamanian 
families of those who died. One Administration official said such compensation 
would be extraordinary in a situation in which civilians became casualties of 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
In the Vietnam War, however, the United States in many cases issued small 
"solatium payments," which did not admit any liability on the part of U.S. 
forces, to the families of civilians killed during combat operations.

WIFE KILLING PUTS BOSTON IN WORST RACIAL CRISIS IN YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The full story of the murder of Carol Stuart and the son she was carrying may 
never be known, because Charles Stuart Jr. is dead now too, apparently having 
jumped from a bridge last Thursday upon learning that he had become the chief 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
But even as Boston police untangle the latest bizarre twists in a crime that 
has riveted the nation, this city is grappling with its anger and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Boston got hoodwinked. There's no question about it," Mayor Raymond L. Flynn 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Was Stuart's suspected plot to kill his wife so extraordinarily cunning that an 
entire city cannot be faulted for having been duped? Or did Boston also fall 
victim to its own prejudices and stereotypes when it ignored inconsistencies in 
Stuart's story and launched a manhunt that tore apart a racially mixed 
neighborhood? 
</P>
<P>
Last October the crime seemed to bring a suburban nightmare to life: Charles 
Stuart called police from his car phone to report that he and his pregnant wife 
had been shot by a black assailant who had forced his way into their car when 
they left a hospital birthing class. His frantic pleas -- replayed over and 
over again, in print, on local broadcasts, even on national network news -- 
compounded a perception that the inner city had become a violent wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, it was not the investigative work of law enforcement agencies or 
journalists that brought Charles Stuart's story tumbling down. It was evidence 
produced by Stuart's brother Matthew, who reportedly did not want to see an 
innocent man sent to jail for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
With this additional twist, the case has sent Boston into what Mayor Flynn 
calls its worst racial crisis since the court-ordered school desegregation 
sparked riots in the mid-1970s. Blame is now being hurled in all directions -- 
at elected officials, investigators, the media and the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
That Charles Stuart could send the city on such a misdirected stampede is 
"bizarre, but in Boston, not unbelievable," says Bill Owens, the black state 
senator who represents the Mission Hill section in which the crime took place. 
"The racism in this city is so deep and ingrained that they wanted to believe 
who they believed, because they depicted the people in our community as 
animals." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Chuck Stuart's account of the events of Oct. 23 was so compelling that 
even many of those who live in Mission Hill were taken in, ashamed at the idea 
of harboring a desperate killer in their midst. Indeed, Mission Hill residents 
themselves provided some of the evidence that made an innocent man from their 
community the focus of suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
To understand the paranoia and hysteria that surrounded the murders of 
30-year-old Carol Stuart and her prematurely delivered son, Christopher, it is 
important to consider the backdrop against which they occurred. In the 40 days 
that preceded the tragedy, Boston had been saturated with news reports of an 
unprecedented wave of 170 shootings that had left five dead and more than 100 
injured in the inner-city neighborhoods that police identify as Area B. That 
area includes heavily black Roxbury, where the diverse enclave of Mission Hill 
is located. 
</P>
<P>
These violent images were the only ones that many Bostonians had of daily life 
in the city's minority neighborhoods. It seemed that there were "huge areas of 
urban Boston populated by crack-crazed black people running around with 
semi-automatic weapons," says Mark Jurkowitz, media critic of the weekly Boston 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"On day one (of the Stuart drama), all of us were willing to suspend disbelief 
and say it's perfectly logical. It had this fundamental visceral appeal to 
everybody who could envision themselves in the Stuarts' shoes." 
</P>
<P>
Black community leaders speculate that Stuart must have counted on these 
perceptions, and on an underlying racism, when he turned his car into Mission 
Hill that night after the birthing class at a nearby hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a man who is trying to get rid of his wife. Chuck Stuart didn't drive 
into a white neighborhood to do it. He understood very clearly the mentality of 
the public. The emotional construct of white female endangerment by black male 
is such a strong emotional force," says Chuck Turner, director of the Center 
for Community Action of the Episcopal City Mission in Roxbury. 
</P>
<P>
If it had happened in a white neighborhood, Turner and others insist, the 
police and the media might have been more reluctant to accept Stuart's story at 
face value. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, there were nagging questions from the start. Why, for example, were the 
Stuarts taking an indirect route home? Why did the gunman kill the woman, 
rather than the man who would have been the bigger threat? How was it that she 
was shot in the back of the head, but he was wounded in the abdomen? 
</P>
<P>
But no one was going to press these issues with a man who had been hurt so 
seriously that he was in the hospital for more than a month, a man grieving for 
his slain wife and the premature baby that died 17 days after being delivered 
by Cesarean section from her unconscious body. 
</P>
<P>
Now there are reports, for the most part unconfirmed, that Stuart took out 
several large insurance policies on his wife, that he had previously plotted 
with his brother to kill her and make it look like a burglary of their house, 
that he was romantically involved with a striking 22-year-old blonde figure 
skating instructor whose picture is being splashed across television screens 
and newspapers here. 
</P>
<P>
Divers Tuesday pulled a gun from a river that police suspect may be the murder 
weapon. The Boston Globe, citing unidentified sources, reported today that its 
registration numbers matched a pistol reported stolen from the fur shop where 
Charles Stuart worked. Stuart's brother Matthew, 23, has said he met his 
brother at the crime scene, where Charles gave him some of Carol Stuart's 
belongings and a gun. Matthew said he threw them into the river. 
</P>
<P>
But there seemed to be little mystery in the days following the shooting. 
Charles Stuart, the 29-year-old manager of a posh fur store, and his tax 
attorney wife were idolized as a "Camelot couple" by the Boston Herald. The 
Boston Globe breathlessly described them as living a "shining life" and having 
"a relationship that by all accounts was so loving it warmed even those at its 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, some of those close to them have trouble letting go of the myth. 
"They didn't argue. They seemed very happy," Carol's brother, Carl DiMaiti, 
said in an interview with a local television station. To the end, he added, 
Charles Stuart had played the role of grieving husband and father to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
Stuart had even arranged to go over to his in-laws for dinner last Thursday, 
the day he instead went to his death in the waters of Boston Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Following the murder, there was both sadness and anger in Mission Hill. 
Residents felt the killing had painted an unfair portrait of their little 
neighborhood, where the crime rate had actually declined 18% over the past 
year. Although Mission Hill is no stranger to drug dealing and other urban 
problems, only four murders had been recorded there since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
They watched as more than 100 police officers fanned out over Mission Hill. At 
one point, city trucks even began digging up the sewers searching for clues. 
</P>
<P>
"They were coming around here going crazy. The cops were checking everybody," 
recalls George Brown, 27, a black resident of Mission Hill's public housing 
project, a sprawling complex of worn red-brick buildings with grassless lawns. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of random searches was already a touchy one in the black and brown 
community. Only weeks before the Stuart shooting, Owens and other black 
officials had obtained a court order demanding that the Boston Police 
Department abandon a policy of frisking young black males even when there was 
no evidence that they had done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
State Superior Court Judge Cortland A. Mathers had likened the so-called 
stop-and-search procedures to "a proclamation of martial law in Roxbury for a 
narrow class of people, young blacks." 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Carol Stuart's death, however, "people in my own community got 
angry with me," Owens recalls. "Some of them said they would be willing to give 
up their constitutional rights to have some activities stopped in their 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Other black leaders wanted to know why it took the murder of a white woman to 
bring such resources out to find a killer. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Flynn insisted that he was reacting as he would to any crime. However, 
James Moody, a 20-year-old black man, had been shot to death the same night as 
Carol Stuart, and "no mayor called about my loss," his girlfriend, Sandra 
Williams, told the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
The Stuart case became fuel for the causes that some politicians had already 
been pushing. Flynn tried to marshal public outrage to win support for his 
drive for higher taxes, pointing out that those taxes would provide more money 
for public safety. It did not work, and he was roundly criticized as having 
tried to exploit the crime for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Others made it their rallying cry for reviving the state's death penalty -- an 
ironic move now, in light of the fact that an innocent man seems to have come 
within inches of being charged with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of the police is also coming under scrutiny. Under intense 
pressure to solve the crime, police and district attorney investigators made it 
known they had a suspect. He was William Bennett, a 39-year-old black man who 
had spent most of his life in trouble with the law and who had served two terms 
in prison for threatening and shooting police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the case against Bennett was built on testimony from three neighborhood 
teen-agers who said they had heard the man make incriminating statements. 
Another Mission Hill woman said she saw him on the night of the murder holding 
a gun and wailing: "It wasn't meant for the woman; it was meant for the man." 
All these stories have since been discredited. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett was arrested on unrelated charges, and was never publicly implicated in 
Carol Stuart's death. However, unnamed police sources told local news media 
that Charles Stuart, seeing Bennett in a police lineup two weeks ago, had 
definitively identified him as the killer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm positive that had not these new revelations occurred, William Bennett 
would have been charged, convicted and sent to prison for the rest of his 
natural life," Owens says. 
</P>
<P>
Boston news organizations are on the defensive regarding their coverage, saying 
it was all based on investigative sources proven reliable in the past. But some 
journalists here acknowledge that they should have more aggressively pursued 
rumors that had begun to circulate suggesting that parts of Charles Stuart's 
account did not wash.

DISNEYLAND TO ANNOUNCE MAJOR EXPANSION PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the most aggressive expansion in its 35-year history, Disneyland this week 
is expected to unveil plans to add several new attractions to the Magic 
Kingdom's entertainment repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
While Walt Disney Co. officials are mum on the plans, employees and other 
sources said the Anaheim park intends to build two new themed areas -- Mickey's 
Birthday Land and a partial reproduction of the studio tour attraction at Walt 
Disney World in Florida. The new attractions may feature rides based on the 
movie characters Indiana Jones, the Muppets and Roger Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
The plans are part of a 10-year development project for Disneyland -- its first 
major expansion since Bear Country, now called Critter Country, was added in 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
Michael D. Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive, is expected to 
announce the company's plans at a press conference on Friday. Other Disney 
officials would only confirm that Eisner will discuss the park's expansion. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of internal meetings this week, Dick Nunis, president of Walt 
Disney Attractions, and Ron Dominguez, Disneyland's executive vice president, 
have been giving park employees a sneak preview of the company's plans. 
</P>
<P>
But employees were told that the expansion plans are being studied by Disney 
and so far are only on the drawing board. "Nothing is definite until Eisner 
announces it," said Disneyland spokesman Bob Roth. 
</P>
<P>
Disneyland spreads across 86 acres of prime property. While the park appears to 
be built to capacity, Disneyland officials said there are 30 undeveloped acres 
within the facility that can be built on. The company also owns about 40 acres 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said the park could use much of the so-called backstage area 
-- which patrons never see -- including warehouse and maintenance facilities. 
The most likely area of expansion within the park is the northwest section, 
stretching from the areas behind Critter Country to Big Thunder Mountain and 
Small World. 
</P>
<P>
The park also could remove existing attractions. A remake of Tomorrowland, with 
its outdated Mission to Mars ride, is on the park's tentative list of plans, 
one employee said. 
</P>
<P>
In their presentation to employees, Disneyland officials revealed few 
specifics. No construction timetables or cost estimates were given. 
</P>
<P>
But the preliminary plans suggest an upgraded Disneyland that is glitzier and 
much more geared toward Hollywood -- and with some elements clearly borrowed 
from Disney's hugely successful, 30,000-acre Walt Disney World Resort in 
Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary plans include: 
</P>
<P>
* A reproduction of Hollywood Boulevard from the Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park 
at Disney World. The Florida studio tour is a romanticized, nostalgic look at 
Hollywood with re-creations of the Chinese Theater, Crossroads of the World and 
stores such as Mickey's of Hollywood spoofing the famous Frederick's shop in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
For Disneyland, "it would be like a second Main Street," said a ride operator 
who attended one of the meetings and who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
* An Indiana Jones attraction, which employees were told could be added near 
Big Thunder Ranch in Frontierland and could have park trains going through it. 
In Florida, the Indiana Jones ride is one of the most popular attractions on 
the studio tour and includes flash fires and explosions, perilous leaps by 
stunt actors and re-creations of famous chase scenes from the hit movies. 
</P>
<P>
* Mickey's Birthday Land, a new themed area that would be Disneyland's eighth 
"land" to be added near the Small World ride. "It would incorporate a Kermit 
the Frog and Muppet ride and a 3-D Muppet movie," said another employee. 
</P>
<P>
Disney already is working on a 3-D Muppet movie that will premiere at Euro 
Disneyland, and word that Eisner has ordered a Muppet ride for Disneyland 
surfaced in the theme park industry soon after the company bought the rights to 
several Muppet characters in August. 
</P>
<P>
A Mickey's Birthday Land was added two years ago at the Florida park. It 
includes a Mickey Mouse show, a small zoo and a miniature community with Mickey 
Mouse's house and Goofy's Clip Joint and Barber Shop. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been the most successful new attraction we've added (at the Florida park) 
in seven years," said Charles Ridgway, publicity director for Walt Disney World 
Resort. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of a character land, where patrons could take photos with all of 
the Disney characters, is also under consideration for the Anaheim park -- as 
was an attraction based on Roger Rabbit and Toon Town, the cartoon hometown in 
the hit film, "Who Framed Roger Rabbit." "Dick Tracy also could be incorporated 
in Toon Town," said a park employee who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been discussions of converting the now-closed America Sings 
attraction into a hovering spacecraft with Audio-Animatronics, those chirping, 
blinking, lifelike robots that populate Pirates of the Caribbean and Small 
World. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed expansion comes six years after the Walt Disney Co. was 
resuscitated by new leadership -- Eisner, former Paramount Pictures president, 
and Disney President Frank Wells, a former Warner Bros. vice chairman. The two 
came aboard in September, 1984, and the theme parks began getting plenty of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
For Disneyland, the expansion comes none too soon. Attendance at the park has 
been flat at about 13 million annually for the last two years. Still, the park 
is the second most popular in the nation, surpassed only by its sister 
attraction in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"The hope is to entice tourists to spend more time here and to give the locals 
more reasons to come back," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
The park spokesman added that the expansion also is "keeping with Walt Disney's 
founding philosophy that the park will never be completed as long as there was 
imagination left in the world."

ALBANIA, LAST OF STALINIST STATES, MAY FALL NEXT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
East Europe's last Communist domino, rigidly Stalinist Albania, may be 
tottering. 
</P>
<P>
The fall of the Nicolae Ceausescu regime in nearby Romania, coupled with severe 
economic problems in Albania itself, last month triggered the first serious 
anti-government demonstration since the Communist revolution in 1944, U.S. 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
The student-led protest in the northern city of Shkoder, Albania's 
second-largest city and a major industrial and transportation center, appears 
to have been put down "immediately and violently," according to a State 
Department official, though the event passed almost unnoticed in the West. 
</P>
<P>
But the growing undercurrents of resistance to Europe's most backward, isolated 
and totalitarian regime led a senior U.S. analyst to predict that "Albania will 
fall as a Communist, Stalinist state -- if not from an uprising, then from 
economic necessity." 
</P>
<P>
A State Department specialist agreed. "Now that Romania is over, all eyes are 
moving to Albania. . . . It's only a question of timing and how it plays out." 
</P>
<P>
Upheaval in Albania would complete a clean sweep of the Continent's Communist 
regimes. 
</P>
<P>
A land of rugged mountains along the Adriatic Sea, Albania has been ruled sinc 
1944 by a Communist government so uncompromising that its leaders broke with 
Moscow in the 1960s, criticizing Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev as too 
soft. They still count Soviet dictator Josef Stalin as their model. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, President Ramiz Alia appears to be on the defensive. Alia, a 
relative centrist in a fragmented Politburo, is thought to be uncertain whether 
to crack down or ease up. 
</P>
<P>
The senior analyst said: "We're seeing a pattern of economic concessions and 
warnings to people that what happened elsewhere is not going to happen in 
Albania. The regime is obviously nervous." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Alia, in his New Year's address to the nation, alluded to the 
pressures engendered by the dramatic pace of change elsewhere in Eastern 
Europe: "The events that have occurred recently in East Europe have inspired 
certain known anti-Albanian forces to resume the campaign of slanders against 
our country. But, as our people say, they cannot succeed in doing us harm." 
</P>
<P>
Since last summer, there have been unconfirmed reports of demonstrations in 
other Albanian towns and villages, including the oil center at Fier and the 
southern city of Korca. 
</P>
<P>
Albania's economy has suffered throughout much of the 1980s, bringing 
increasing deprivation to what was already Europe's poorest state. After three 
years of drought, the country, once self-sufficient, had to import food in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Albanian officials have reported publicly that 1989 brought a marked recovery, 
but a U.S. official warned, "None of their figures have ever been reliable." 
</P>
<P>
"Economic difficulties and necessity are driving Albania into the 20th Century 
and forcing it to deal with the outside world," another U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
As with most of the new opposition movements in Eastern Europe, anti-government 
activity appears to be centered among students. They are a particularly 
important segment of the population of Albania because, with one of the highest 
birthrates in Europe, an estimated two-thirds of its 3.2 million people are 
under 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Communist regime may have helped spawn its own opposition. 
Albanian government statistics show that only 15% of the population was 
literate in 1944. In one of its few positive accomplishments, the regime has 
raised that figure to 75%, according to U.S. analysts. 
</P>
<P>
"This generation of Albanian youth is pretty well educated. It's surprising how 
many speak foreign languages, especially German and English," the State 
Department specialist said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're also not as isolated as we once thought," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. expert agreed: "Albania is an island politically from the rest of 
Eastern Europe. But geographically it is still there -- and the impact has to 
be felt. 
</P>
<P>
"Albanians are not isolated from news. They get Yugoslav, Greek and Italian TV, 
plus the Voice of America. They even get 'Dallas' in Italian. The Albanian 
press has also given pretty accurate coverage of events in Romania. They know 
what's going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to read, to travel, to eat well and to be fashionable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an officially sanctioned poll last fall, students showed unprecedented 
interest in Western rock music. 
</P>
<P>
The Albanian press has recently reported on extensive "hooliganism," widely 
interpreted by Western specialists as a denunciation of new student activism. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a young people's revolution," one such analyst predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Another potential source of opposition comes from within the peasant community, 
which accounts for 70% of the population and is divided among Albania's 
legendary clans. 
</P>
<P>
"(The late President Enver) Hoxha never controlled the peasants. And among the 
peasants today, the Communists have no credibility. They are known only for the 
negative, not the positive," a U.S. analyst said. "The peasants don't think in 
terms of liberation. They only know that the government has taken away their 
land and their animals." 
</P>
<P>
Hoxha, who died in 1985, was the guerrilla leader who led the resistance 
against the Italians and Germans in World War II and who ruled the state for 
four decades in a staunchly Stalinist fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The tightly knit clans have also proven largely impenetrable by the state's 
Draconian secret police, the Sigurimi, U.S. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the first visible signs of opposition have emerged at a time when 
Alia appears to be moving cautiously toward reform. In a series of steps, he 
has encouraged Albania's government-run media to report objectively about some 
issues and has publicly criticized the government bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
He has also allowed a handful of American tourists to visit and has established 
links with American-Albanian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Alia has even eased the country's official atheism, allowing religious 
ceremonies in private homes. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been tantalizing hints of a desire on Alia's part for official 
contacts with the United States -- the first from an Albanian leader since the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Albanian Orthodox Church in the United States, the Very Rev. 
Arthur Liolin, was granted a brief meeting with Alia in November, the first 
time an Albanian Communist leader has met with such a prominent religious 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
Liolin met last week with Asst. Secretary of State Raymond Seitz and said 
Albania has loosened its prohibition on religious practices and is seeking 
business contacts with U.S. firms. "They are very interested in the United 
States," he said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has no diplomatic relations with Albania at any level, a 
State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
Alia also allowed the publication of a book that denounced the brutality, 
absolute power and human rights abuses of the Sigurimi. 
</P>
<P>
"Alia is trying to save the (Communist) Party by finding scapegoats, either in 
the bureaucracy or the secret police," said Elez Biberaj, the director of the 
VOA's Albanian service and the author of several works on Albania. 
</P>
<P>
He and several U.S. officials pointed out that Alia is trapped in a political 
Catch-22. 
</P>
<P>
"The party must reform itself for the sake of the economy, and there are some 
indications that Alia is trying to do it. But if he should carry out radical 
reforms, it would almost surely lead to the decline of the party and the 
system. It's a no-win position," Biberaj said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials predict that Albania's looming upheaval is likely to be violent. 
</P>
<P>
"When Albania goes, it will probably go along the lines of the Romanian model. 
In other words, it will start with an incident, a protest over something like a 
missed food shipment. That will lead to massive repression and deaths. Then it 
snowballs into an uprising," a U.S. analyst said.

VOTE BY LIBERAL BATES AIDS BILL TO CURB PORNOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the Legislature's most liberal Democrats cast the deciding vote Tuesday 
enabling the Assembly Public Safety Committee to pass legislation that would 
all but ban the sale of graphic pornography from street-side vending machines. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Oakland), who almost always votes in line with the 
American Civil Liberties Union, said he believes it makes sense to keep such 
explicit pornography out of the hands of children. Democrat Curtis Tucker Jr. 
of Inglewood also voted for the bill, giving the three Republicans on the 
committee the five-vote majority needed to send the measure to the Assembly 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), is aimed at curbing 
pornography sales from coin-operated sidewalk vending machines commonly found 
along downtown streets and increasingly in suburban areas. The machines and the 
magazines and newspapers they display have raised the ire of community and 
religious groups throughout the state, mainly because they are easily 
accessible to children. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would allow the sale of "harmful matter" from these vending 
machines only in areas supervised by an adult, a change that would probably end 
their use in public areas. Harmful matter is already defined in current law and 
includes photographs of the acts of sodomy, oral copulation, sexual 
intercourse, masturbation and bestiality. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is a follow-up to a measure passed and signed by the governor in 1988 
that prohibited the sale of pornography from vending machines if children would 
be able to view the material. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, one of the most conservative members of the Legislature, said he was 
surprised but pleased by Bates' support. "We have always been antagonists," 
Ferguson said. "I didn't even ask him for his vote because I didn't think he 
would give it to me." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Bates fended off criticism from the ACLU lobbyist and 
Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), the committee's chairman, who voted 
against the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know what this bill does?" Burton asked Bates. "It's garbage." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Pena, the ACLU representative, asked Bates how he planned to defend 
his vote in his liberal district, which includes the Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have to defend it," Bates replied. "I'm concerned about the First 
Amendment. But I'm convinced that this is not going to restrict the access (for 
adults) to the material. It is simply going to make it more difficult for kids. 
I think there's a real problem going on out there with kids. I just don't think 
they should be exposed to this material." 
</P>
<P>
During the hearing, Pena told the committee that the material the bill would 
regulate is "protected speech" under the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill would make that material inaccessible to adults in coin-operated 
machines, since no one is going to hire an adult to supervise the machines," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was also opposed by the publisher of Spectator Magazine, which is sold 
from vending machines. But the measure had the support of the city and county 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson said he believes the bill will fare well on the Assembly floor and in 
the Senate because lawmakers are increasingly attuned to a concern among the 
electorate about moral values. He cited the results of two recent Los Angeles 
Times Polls, one of which found that the public believes most legislators are 
corrupt and the other that showed 65% of Americans expressing dissatisfaction 
about "moral values these days." 
</P>
<P>
"Most elected officials do not want to be cast as something they are not," he 
said. "And most of them are not crooks. The large majority are honest and are 
trying to be perceived as attentive to the public's concerns, even if it means 
doing something this year that they wouldn't have done last year -- like voting 
for an anti-pornography bill."

BIGGER SHARE OF GAS FUNDS FOR NORTH MAY BE SOUGHT 
</P>

<P>
In a move that could renew old North-South battles over highway funding, 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown said Tuesday that he may seek more revenue from a 
proposed gas tax increase for Northern California highways and mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco Democrat, speaking off the cuff after a California Teachers 
Assn. rally, said that as the revenue split is proposed, it appears the North 
would be shortchanged on these priority projects. 
</P>
<P>
If his analysis proves correct, Brown said, he will seek legislation forcing a 
redistribution of the new tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who was one of the architects of a complex plan to increase the gasoline 
tax and modify the state's spending limit, is the first top state leader to 
express qualms about the proposal. By demanding changes, Brown could upset the 
delicate compromise that was crafted last year by legislative leaders and Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for a 9-cent-per-gallon increase in the gasoline tax, which 
would be used to help finance a 10-year, $18.5-billion program to improve the 
state's transportation system and reduce congestion. Because the tax increase 
would create more revenue than the Legislature could spend under current 
restrictions, the gas tax increase is tied to a constitutional amendment that 
would modify the state spending limit. 
</P>
<P>
The gas tax cannot go into effect unless voters approve the spending limit 
amendment next June. 
</P>
<P>
As planned, 60% of the new tax revenues would go to Southern California and 40% 
to Northern California. Brown does not quarrel with the overall split but he 
notes that of the North's 40%, most is allotted for highway maintainance and 
only a small portion is designated for new highways and mass transit. The 
South, on the other hand, would receive most of its share for highways and such 
projects as light rail. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brown said at the rally that he considers the breakdown unfair, a 
spokesman for Brown hastened to add afterward that the Speaker had not meant by 
his comments to indicate that he was openly opposing the proposed new tax. 
</P>
<P>
"He just thought it (the formula) was a done deal," the spokesman said. "He's 
under a lot of pressure from city and county officials in his area and he wants 
to look into it. " 
</P>
<P>
However, key legislators in both houses disagreed about a possible solution to 
Brown's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) said 
problems with the formula could be addressed easily in new legislation but 
Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said 
Southern California lawmakers would not be willing to support any change that 
would take money from their area. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are to be changes, they will not come at the expense of Southern 
California," Katz said. "One thing the North has to remember is that the vast 
amount of the sales tax being raised to help the Bay Area is coming from 
Southern California. That's something that can't be overlooked when we discuss 
these proposals." 
</P>
<P>
A quarter-cent sales tax increase went into effect Dec. 1 to help pay for 
repairs and rehabilitation to areas damaged by the Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Katz said the planned allocation of funds is reasonable, but Kopp said he 
didn't think it was fair that maintenance funds be considered in the formula, 
especially when his area was being hit with additional costs because of the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased that Speaker Brown recognizes that we have a problem," Kopp said. 
"To me it's a solvable problem. I think (Brown's comments) are a healthy sign 
because this is the major issue as far as I'm concerned."

MOORE TELLS OF RETURNING STING PAYMENT; 
</P>

<P>
Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, in her first public statement about payments she 
received from federal undercover agents, said Tuesday she returned one $5,000 
campaign contribution in 1986 because it appeared to be a bribe. 
</P>
<P>
But the Los Angeles Democrat said she kept a $2,000 donation two years later 
from undercover operatives posing as businessmen because they attended one of 
her fund-raising events. "They bought tickets, they came to my fund-raiser, 
they ate my food and so I kept the money," she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's comments came after she testified as the first defense witness in the 
federal trial of state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who faces 12 counts 
of extortion, racketeering, bribery and money laundering stemming from the 
federal undercover investigation of political corruption in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, who unwittingly carried two bills for dummy companies set up by the FBI, 
is one of at least five state elected officials who remain under investigation 
in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the courtroom, Moore told reporters that she now believes she was 
tape-recorded in 1986 by an undercover agent using the name Jack Gordon. Gordon 
-- in reality FBI Agent Jack Brennan -- was posing as an Alabama businessman 
who was seeking special legislative help in opening a shrimp processing plant 
near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Moore said, Gordon approached her and asked if the payment she 
had received was "enough." 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded like he thought he was giving me a bribe," she said. "I didn't like 
his attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said she was unaware at that time that Gordon's "company," Gulf Shrimp 
Fisheries, had given her campaign a $5,000 contribution. She recalled that she 
told him, "I'm sure whatever you gave was enough." 
</P>
<P>
Upon learning later that the "company" had made the large donation, she said 
she promptly returned the money. 
</P>
<P>
However, her 1986 experience with Gordon did not stop her from carrying a 
similar bill to help the shrimp company in 1988 when a new cast of undercover 
informants approached her office. This time around, Moore kept the $2,000 
contribution made by a second dummy FBI company when agents purchased four $500 
tickets to a fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
"I've done nothing wrong," Moore told reporters. "I've tried to cooperate with 
every legitimate investigation. I have nothing to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Until Tuesday, Moore had not spoken with federal investigators or with 
Montoya's lawyers. U.S. Atty. David F. Levi made a point of noting before her 
testimony that she is under active investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The assemblywoman was called to the stand by Montoya's attorneys to explain her 
role as legislative author of the two bills that were planted as part of the 
federal sting operation. The defense also called to the stand Senate Republican 
Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who managed one of the bills on the Senate floor in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
But the testimony of both legislators appeared to do more to bolster the 
prosecution than to aid the defense. Both Moore and Maddy said they did not 
take part in the kind of activities Montoya is accused of engaging in -- 
including receiving a $3,000 honorarium at a breakfast meeting shortly before 
one of the bills was scheduled for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by Levi, Moore and Maddy said they never solicited 
campaign contributions or other payments from the undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
"You did not ask for anything?" Levi asked Maddy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's correct," the senator replied. 
</P>
<P>
"And you would not?" the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's correct," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
To some degree, Montoya's attorneys were handicapped by a ruling from U.S. 
District Judge Milton Schwartz, who prohibited the defense from asking the 
legislators why they pushed the measure. Schwartz ruled that the motives of the 
legislators in backing the bills was irrelevant in establishing the reasons for 
Montoya's actions. 
</P>
<P>
In his testimony, Maddy said he does not know at this point how he became the 
Senate floor manager for the bill in 1988 except that it was arranged by 
someone on his staff. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate GOP leader said it was a surprise to him when the bill came up for 
action and he was called on by the presiding officer of the Senate to present 
the bill. He looked on his desk, he said, and found a prepared statement on the 
bill for him to read. 
</P>
<P>
There was no debate on the measure and it quickly passed, the entire matter 
taking only a minute, he said. He later chastised members of his staff for 
agreeing that he would handle the bill, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In her testimony, Moore said she agreed to author both versions of the bill 
because the measure would have helped the "company" provide 35 to 40 new jobs, 
most of them for minority and low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was actually written by FBI agents and the U.S. attorney's office, 
according to George Murray, an undercover FBI agent who testified earlier in 
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
In calling Moore to the stand, defense attorney Michael Sands had hoped to 
demonstrate that Montoya also supported the measure because of the prospects 
for increased minority employment. 
</P>
<P>
However, Moore testified that she did not recall whether Montoya was in 
attendance at a Senate committee meeting when she presented her arguments on 
behalf of the bill. And, she said, she never had a private conversation with 
Montoya about the bill. Similarly, Maddy told the jury that he never discussed 
the bill with Montoya.

HEALTH: WITNESSES AT HEARING URGE OSHA TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS FOR 
HEALTH-CARE WORKERS. THEY TELL OF DANGERS OF CONTRACTING BLOOD-BORNE HEPATITIS

LaVonne Wilenken on Tuesday told of coming home from her job as a nurse soaked 
to the skin with blood. 
</P>
<P>
Don Jewett, an orthopedic surgeon, told of having blood seep through his mask 
and protective goggles during surgery. Jewett said he concluded that he would 
be safer wearing a respirator. 
</P>
<P>
The two were among the first in what is expected to be a weeklong parade of 
witnesses supporting the federal government's first proposed crackdown on 
biological hazards in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is gingerly stepping outside 
its traditional confines of factory floors and construction sites by proposing 
that hundreds of thousands of the nation's employers spend $850 million a year 
to better protect 4.7 million health-care workers against contracting 
blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
The agency on Tuesday began the last in a series of regional public hearings on 
a proposal that has drawn more public interest than any in OSHA's 20-year 
history, generating 3,000 pieces of correspondence, both pro and con. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed rules, expected to be completed early next year, are aimed 
primarily at the 12,000 people -- from nurses to lab technicians to hospital 
janitors -- who are infected with hepatitis B on the job each year, often by 
accidentally puncturing their skin with needles that have been used to draw 
blood from infected patients. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 of these hepatitis cases became acute, resulting in 600 
hospitalizations and 200 deaths a year. There have been only 19 reported and 
documented cases involving health-care workers who have been infected with HIV 
through job-related exposure. The HIV virusis far less easily transmitted than 
hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to health-care workers, the regulations would cover another 600,000 
people in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
The largest number of workers identified by OSHA as "at risk" are 2 million 
nurses, doctors and janitors who work in 5,000 hospitals. Other major targets 
include workers in 180,000 doctors' offices, 12,000 medical and dental labs and 
20,000 residential care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The regulations would require that employees receive free hepatitis B 
vaccinations, formal periodic training in the risks of their job and extensive 
protective equipment, including disposable gloves, gowns, leak-proof 
containers, fluid-proof aprons, face masks and goggles. About half of the extra 
cost would go for equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The rules would apply to any worker who is likely to be exposed to a virus 
carrier once a month or more. 
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals, blood banks and medical offices already voluntarily follow 
"universal precautions" recommended by the Centers for Disease Control. Under 
the CDC guidelines, all blood is treated as potentially infectious. 
</P>
<P>
However, organized labor, which has pressured OSHA for years to require and 
enforce such procedures, has contended that employee awareness of the CDC 
recommendations and of the general danger of contacting viruses is low. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the 925,000-member Service Employees International Union, which 
first asked OSHA in 1983 to require free hepatitis B vaccinations for 
health-care workers, conducted a survey of 40 hospitals in 1987 and found that 
compliance with CDC recommendations was "spotty at best." 
</P>
<P>
According to OSHA's own estimates, hospitals provide gloves to at-risk workers 
90% of the time but provide other protective equipment only 60% to 80% of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Wilenken, director of family health studies for the Santa Monica-based American 
Assn. of Women, testified Tuesday that an informal poll by her group of 50 
nurses and doctors at several Los Angeles County-run hospitals found that 
three-quarters of the workers did not report all needle-puncture incidents and 
that one-third did not know the proper procedure for reporting them. 
</P>
<P>
Wilenken, who also works as a nurse at Los Angeles County's Olive View Medical 
Center, objected to the amount of money being spent to educate drug addicts and 
prostitutes about the dangers of AIDS compared to what she characterized as 
"the pitiful excuses for protective eye wear, paper scrub suits and barely 
waterproof surgical gowns found in every L.A. County-operated medical 
facility." 
</P>
<P>
"Millions of health care workers in this country, both union and non-union 
alike, are employed in the practice of what can only be described as 
'battlefront' medicine. They are like the proverbial sacrificial lambs to the 
slaughter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The women's group last week filed a complaint with Cal/OSHA alleging a lack of 
training. 
</P>
<P>
"Many times when the evening or night people arrive there are no linen 
garments," Wilenken said. "What's left are paper scrub suits. . . . I go home 
sometimes soaked to the skin with blood." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital industry, which the government estimates would have to spend an 
extra $194 million a year to comply with the regulations, opposes the mandatory 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Karpiak, a staff specialist for the American Hospital Assn., said in a 
telephone interview from Chicago that the regulations improperly go beyond the 
CDC standards and suggested that OSHA was venturing into the health-care field 
with an overly rigid approach. 
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis inflames the liver. The type known as hepatitis B, formerly called 
serum hepatitis, is transmitted sexually or by blood-to-blood contact. Of 
several types of viral hepatitis, it is by far the kind most likely to be 
contracted by health-care workers. Between 7% and 30% of health-care workers 
sustaining needle-stick puncture wounds from hepatitis B-infected patients 
become infected, OSHA said. 
</P>
<P>
While health-care workers have been recognized as suffering from high rates of 
hepatitis B since the 1970s, and while a vaccine against the virus has been 
available since 1982, it was not until the more recent furor over AIDS that 
OSHA began to fashion rules for hospitals, nursing homes, labs and other work 
sites 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, OSHA turned down a petition from the American Federation 
of State, County and Municipal Employees asking the agency to set an emergency 
regulation requiring hepatitis B vaccinations for at-risk workers. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Santangelo, a representative of the California Nurses Assn., was among 
several speakers Tuesday who urged that vaccinations be made available to all 
health-care workers, not merely those whose exposure is predictable. 
</P>
<P>
Santangelo also urged that OSHA require confidentiality for infected workers 
who seek workers compensation through local governments. A nurse who 
accidentally stuck herself with an AIDS-infected needle at San Francisco 
General Hospital in 1987 fought a two-year battle over confidentiality before 
reaching a settlement in which the city's workers compensation system agreed to 
process her claim without revealing her name. 
</P>
<P>
Other speakers called on OSHA to strengthen the proposed rules by requiring 
engineering improvements in hospital needles and other sharp hospital 
instruments to reduce the incidence of accidental punctures. 
</P>
<P>
Jewett, a professor of orthopedic surgery at UC San Francisco, urged OSHA to 
add to the regulations a requirement for operating room personnel to wear 
respirator-like devices in surgery where power tools are used. 
</P>
<P>
Jewett said the large amount of blood produced during such surgery makes 
traditional protection ineffective. Blood can splatter under masks and goggles, 
he said.

JAPAN TO SEEK LARGER ROLE IN EAST EUROPE;

<P>
FOREIGN AID: THE PRIME MINISTER SAYS POLAND AND HUNGARY WILL GET LOANS OF $500 
MILLION.

<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu declared Tuesday that Japan should play 
an economic and political role in East Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu, referring to a $1-billion Japanese aid program for Poland and Hungary, 
told a meeting at the German-Japanese Center, "We are ready positively to 
support the democratization of Eastern Europe and help them bring about a new 
order." 
</P>
<P>
He said the move toward reform in East Europe "affects not only European 
affairs but also the basic structure of the current international order." 
</P>
<P>
Kaifu said he is "convinced that Japan, as a leading member of the 
industrialized democracies, is expected to play a major role not only 
economically but also politically." 
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan's aid to Poland and Hungary will take the form of a 
$500-million loan for each country from the Japanese Export-Import Bank. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Japan will provide $350 million to guarantee Japanese 
companies' investments in Poland and will double the guarantee for trade with 
Hungary to $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, he said, should also strengthen its ties to West European nations -- the 
main purpose of his 11-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the Berlin Wall, Kaifu said: "It is as if a spring breeze 
blew through this wall, from the West and from the East. Now it has become a 
good wall." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a West Berlin prosecutor freed an East German Communist official, 
Alexander Schalck-Golodkowski, who is wanted for alleged fraud in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor, Dietrich Schultz, said he has rejected an East German request 
for extradition because there are insufficient grounds to open legal 
proceedings against Schalck-Golodkowski in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Schalck-Golodkowski, who was in charge of foreign currency dealings in the 
ousted Communist regime, has been accused in East Berlin of embezzling funds he 
controlled as head of an organization exporting arms. He fled to the West when 
the regime collapsed in December and gave himself up to authorities in West 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
He offered to return about $35 million that had been deposited in Swiss banks 
to finance hard-currency sales outside of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In another development in East Berlin, authorities announced that restrictions 
on foreign reporters will be lifted. In the future, they said, foreign 
reporters will be able to contact anyone they choose. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old rules, reporters needed official permission to talk with 
government officials, or even casual citizens. But this rule had not been 
observed since the start of the street demonstrations that led to the fall of 
the Communist regime of Erich Honecker.

NAVAL PLAN, PERU INCIDENT STRAIN LATIN TIES, U.S. SAYS;

The proposed deployment of Navy warships off Colombia has further strained 
inter-American relations and complicated the drug war, the Bush Administration 
acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. relations with Peru suffered a strain after U.S. troops 
surrounded a Peruvian diplomat's residence in Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said U.S. officials are 
providing assurances to Latin American leaders that the two incidents do not 
signal an increased U.S. aggressiveness in the wake of last month's invasion of 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
She said that a team of U.S. representatives will arrive in Colombia on Friday 
to participate in planning sessions for a scheduled Western Hemisphere drug 
summit on Feb. 15, and it appeared that Colombia, Bolivia and Peru still would 
participate as planned. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Peru said Tuesday that it has granted diplomatic asylum to 
five Panamanian army officers and seven family members and has officially 
protested the posting of U.S. troops near the home of Peru's ambassador to 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities ordered the posting of 10 U.S. soldiers there Monday after 
receiving information that Lt. Col. Luis Cordoba, a police chief under deposed 
Panamanian dictator Manual A. Noriega, had taken refuge in the residence. 
Peruvian officials deny Cordoba is there. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said Peru has asked Panama to provide safe conduct for the 
12 asylum seekers, who sought refuge in the ambassador's house after Noriega 
was ousted in the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The five officers include senior military aides to the deposed strongman and 
Noriega's personal secretary. Panama's Foreign Minister Julio Linares said they 
will be granted safe passage if no criminal charges are pending. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials, meanwhile, said their plans to deploy two naval vessels on 
drug-fighting duty off Colombia have been placed on hold and will not be 
pursued without the concurrence of the Bogota government. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials had said the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and the 
nuclear-powered cruiser Virginia left Norfolk, Va., last Thursday headed for 
international waters off Colombia on an assignment to monitor and intercept 
drug shipments. 
</P>
<P>
But disclosure of the deployment plans caused a furor in Colombia, where the 
action was characterized as an American "blockade," and the U.S. government 
said the two ships instead will be conducting "routine operations" off Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler acknowledged that the incident at the Peruvian residence in Panama and 
the aborted deployment of the two ships had further strained already tense 
relations with Latin American leaders who objected to the U.S. invasion of 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
But she rejected suggestions that the Peruvian and Colombian concerns have 
become major problems, saying only that they had "complicated" diplomatic 
consultations. 
</P>
<P>
"All of our ambassadors who are on the ground, all our political officers, all 
our embassy personnel, (Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America) Bernie 
Aronson and all our staff here, sure, they're working in this region to assure 
them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler repeated President Bush's statement that the Panamanian invasion was 
not a pattern for future U.S. action in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, she refused to rule out the use of warships in the U.S. campaign 
against international drug trafficking. She said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney 
has not yet recommended to the President a final plan of action for Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
Tutwiler blamed the Colombian concerns on "misinformation" about U.S. plans to 
use warships to intercept drug traffickers off the coast of that country, the 
source of much of the world's cocaine supply. 
</P>
<P>
Planning sessions for the drug summit begin today in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, with 
meetings of Bolivian, Peruvian and Colombian delegates. U.S. representatives 
will join the discussions Friday. The four-nation summit will be held next 
month in Cartagena, Colombia.

<P>
Sendero Luminoso rebels shot and killed a former defense minister Tuesday 
morning in a shopping center parking lot, the most prominent person slain in 10 
years of guerrilla war in Peru, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrique Lopez, shot at close range as he was parking his car in the Lima suburb 
of San Isidro, was the first person who had reached Cabinet level to be killed 
in the escalating guerrilla violence that has claimed the lives of hundreds of 
federal and local officials. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, who asked not to be identified, said 
four men with submachine guns fired at least 10 bullets into Lopez at 10 a.m., 
two miles south of downtown Lima. He said Lopez was alone in the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, rushed to a nearby military hospital, died in surgery, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez was named Peru's first defense minister by President Alan Garcia, taking 
office in 1987 when the ministry was formed. He had served as minister of the 
army until the armed forces were joined under one ministry that year. 
</P>
<P>
He was replaced last May by army Gen. Julio Velasquez. 
</P>
<P>
Officials blamed the attack on the fanatical Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), a 
radical Maoist terrorist group that has been fighting to topple Peru's elected 
governments since 1980.

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are gaping holes in the roof where Roberto Rivera once lived, and a 
streak of bloodstains on the floor where he died. 
</P>
<P>
One minute, the 26-year-old taxi driver had been standing by his closet that 
early Wednesday morning, gleefully saying how happy he was that the Americans 
had invaded at last. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the hail of metal from the sky as a U.S. helicopter gunship opened 
fire on the San Miguelito barrio below. Its targets were two Dignity Battalion 
members who had been taking potshots at the massive chopper and now were 
fleeing through the back alleys. 
</P>
<P>
The snipers got away. But the fearsome strafing left the housebound civilians 
below with no such chance. As his four brothers watched from their beds in the 
tiny room all of them shared, Rivera was cut down in a volley that shredded the 
corrugated-metal roof and left a line of bullet holes across his chest. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how many Panamanians like Rivera became innocent victims during the 
U.S. invasion here last month remains a matter of contention and dispute. But 
what is known about those casualties would suggest that the young taxi driver, 
whose blue Lada sedan was still parked at the curb Tuesday as his family and 
neighbors told how he died, was in important ways typical of the more than 200 
civilians freshly buried in the tropical soil. 
</P>
<P>
Like the vast majority of other victims, Rivera died from gunfire and not from 
the fires once thought to have been the cause of many civilian deaths. Like 
others, he fell victim to bullets that went astray -- proof that war is rarely 
surgical, no matter how carefully it is waged. 
</P>
<P>
And for all the horror of the accidental death, there was an echo also in the 
acquiescence with which Rivera's relatives greeted it, shedding tears of 
anguish but insisting, as did other grieving families, that they harbored not 
the slightest anger at those who pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the Americans' fault," said Alina Varela, the mother of the taxi 
driver's two toddlers, Amarys and Robertito. "The Dignity Battalions were 
shooting. The helicopter had to shoot back." 
</P>
<P>
"It was an accident," said Rivera's brother Ricardo, his own leg still swathed 
in bandages after being ripped open by shrapnel in the same attack. 
</P>
<P>
A similar forgiveness emanated from the house next door, where the same attack 
on the first full morning of the U.S. invasion left Aida de Aviles with a 
shoulder full of shrapnel as she dived to the concrete floor, the safer spaces 
beneath the beds already occupied by her husband and children. 
</P>
<P>
Although De Aviles spent four days in the hospital after an operation to remove 
the American shell fragment, and her family has amassed a metallic handful from 
others that were embedded in walls and furniture, their only concern Tuesday 
was whether Mutual of Omaha would reimburse their medical costs of well over 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
The problem they and their neighbors on Calle L faced lay in the fine print of 
insurance policies that disavowed responsibility in the case of war. And the 
official explanation for the horror stared bluntly at them from the pages of 
Roberto Rivera's death certificate. 
</P>
<P>
"How did it occur?" the document asked. "Guerra" (war) was the official answer. 
</P>
<P>
"How am I going to care for these babies?" asked a teary-eyed Varela, the 
mother of the dead taxi driver's two children, who said she had never held a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
She and the rest of the family said that despite reporting the circumstances of 
the accident to hospital officials nearly three weeks ago, they had heard 
nothing from U.S. military authorities. And while absolving the soldiers of any 
blame, they held out hope that the United States might offer some sort of 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
Even those whose wounds were more minor said in interviews around the city 
Tuesday that their contentment with the American invasion might turn to anger 
if their economic hurts were not redressed. 
</P>
<P>
On Via Cincuentario in Panama Viejo on the first full night after the invasion, 
residents found themselves under fire when a careening Toyota failed to obey a 
U.S. Army patrol's order to halt. 
</P>
<P>
The car, filled with a looters' treasure of tables and chairs, was made barely 
recognizable when the troops halted its flight with an anti-tank shell, killing 
the three young occupants. 
</P>
<P>
But a row of modest houses bore similar scars, with windows shattered and walls 
riddled with hundreds of holes large and small. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not angry," said Dimas Perez, who showed a reporter a list itemizing the 
damage that he said he intended to deliver today to the U.S. Army's Southern 
Command headquarters. "I just want to get paid."

TEXT OF GOVERNOR'S LAST STATE OF THE STATE MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the full text of Gov. George Deukmejian's State of the State address. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. McCarthy, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tem, members of the 
Legislature, fellow constitutional officers and fellow Californians: 
</P>
<P>
As I begin the first year of the 1990s, on behalf of Gloria and myself we want 
to wish all of you a decade that is filled with hope, with peace, continued 
prosperity and with much happiness. 
</P>
<P>
When I delivered my first State of the State address in 1983, we all came 
together at a time when the state was experiencing an economic quake. For the 
past seven years, we have worked together to restore fiscal solvency, our 
credit rating, the economy, and to create jobs, jobs and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the California that was once headed for the poorhouse is now an 
economic powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, unemployment was 11%. We had no overseas trade offices, no tourism 
promotion program and no competitive technology, workfare or Rural Renaissance 
programs. The agricultural industry was on the ropes. Our workers' compensation 
program was a mess, and prior to our Administration we had one of the highest 
tax burdens in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, unemployment has been cut to 5.3%, and 2.7 million new jobs have 
been created for our people. And while the budget I inherited contained a 
$1.5-billion deficit, the budget I leave my successor will contain a 
substantial surplus. 
</P>
<P>
We have become a state of builders. All told, we have invested or have 
immediate plans to invest $44.6 billion to expand and improve California's 
infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
We have constructed or rehabilitated 1,133 lane miles of state roads and 
highways, including the addition of 478 miles of new roads to our system. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, California had just 12 state prisons to house dangerous criminals. 
Since then, we have built 14 new prison facilities. That has enabled us to 
remove an additional 52,000 convicted felons from neighborhoods to send them to 
state prison. And I will continue to push for a constitutional amendment that 
allows all able-bodied criminals to work and help pay the cost of their upkeep, 
just like the rest of us must do. 
</P>
<P>
We had no integrated strategy to clean up toxic waste or reduce non-hazardous 
waste. In 1983, none of our state hospitals for the mentally ill were 
accredited. Today, all of them are accredited. We are providing $127 million 
this year to aid the homeless in our state. Our commitment to fighting AIDS and 
finding a cure for that dreaded disease is unmatched by any other state. And 
this year, we will provide 20 million meals for seniors, as well as income 
security for more than 800,000 elderly, blind and disabled Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Building on the progress of the '80s, it's time to turn to the challenges of 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
We'll get nowhere fast if we don't do something about freeway gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, we developed a major transportation improvement plan for the 1990s. 
This June, the voters will be asked to approve the Traffic Congestion Relief 
and Spending Limitation Act of 1990, a comprehensive plan to relieve traffic 
congestion on our highways, upgrade our urban and rural road systems, and 
expand mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
This plan is absolutely essential to the economic future of our state. If you 
want to spend less time stuck in traffic, if you want cleaner air and if you 
want to ensure that California's economy will continue to grow so that your 
children will have job opportunities, then I suggest it is worth paying a few 
more pennies a day. I'm strongly urging all Californians to join me and a 
bipartisan majority in the Legislature in giving this landmark proposal their 
enthusiastic support. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the next exit on the freeway is becoming harder to reach, so is the 
dream of home ownership. I am proposing that the Legislature join me in 
enacting a five-year, $2-billion Housing Opportunity Program to greatly expand 
our efforts to put home ownership back within reach of the average family. 
</P>
<P>
Using its existing bonding authority, the California Housing Finance Agency 
will raise $1.8 billion of these funds through the issuance of both revenue and 
private activity bonds. Another $200 million can be generated through a 
reauthorization of unutilized general obligation bonds already approved by the 
voters when they passed the First-Time Homebuyers Bond Act of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Together, these funds will be dedicated to providing down payment assistance 
and reduced interest rate mortgages for thousands of first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
With home ownership in California becoming even more difficult, let us take 
these important steps now to prevent the American dream from becoming the 
impossible dream. 
</P>
<P>
The dawn of a new decade should bring with it completion of our work on another 
milestone of humanity -- basic health care coverage for all working 
Californians and their families. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 4 million working Californians and dependents have no coverage, 
and securing private health insurance is too expensive for most of these 
families. 
</P>
<P>
Pursuant to legislation I signed last year, a task force established by our 
Administration will make recommendations shortly so that we can develop a plan 
that is both fair to small businesses and which addresses the health care needs 
of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
And while we're talking about insurance, let me also address the subject of car 
insurance. When I vetoed Assembly Bill 2315 last year, I told the bill's 
author, Speaker Willie Brown, that I would work with him to develop a practical 
and affordable basic policy for motorists who are now unable to secure or 
afford even minimal coverage. Our staffs have begun discussions which I hope 
will lead to some positive steps this year to increase the affordability of 
automobile insurance in California. 
</P>
<P>
California's response to the terrifying earthquake of Oct. 17, 1989, was 
outstanding. That earthquake may have registered high on the Richter scale, but 
our people registered even higher on the courage scale. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, we should learn from this experience and take additional steps now to 
prepare for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
I am proposing $11 million in additional expenditures to fund new disaster 
readiness measures including: planning a site for a Southern California 
Operations Center of the Office of Emergency Services; statewide inspection of 
public schools and state buildings; and the purchase of additional rescue and 
communications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
I am also proposing an additional $350 million in bonds to retrofit state 
buildingsand higher education facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, I am proposing that $15 million from the proceeds of the sale of 
some surplus property at Agnews State Hospital in San Jose be directed toward 
providing permanent housing for low-income residents displaced from their homes 
by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Also, I will propose a method to assist earthquake-affected communities which 
sustained major losses of tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, let's understand that there are going to be additional serious 
earthquakes in California in the future, and we cannot duck that reality. No 
earthquake rebuilding effort will be complete, or responsible, until we make 
earthquake insurance coverage a mandatory feature of all policies written for 
at-risk privately owned buildings. I am asking the insurance industry, the 
business community and the Legislature to work with me to develop a practical 
plan to achieve this goal this year. 
</P>
<P>
We can't talk about the challenges of the 1990s without speaking of 
California's children. During the past seven years, we have accomplished some 
needed reforms in our public schools and more than doubled their funding. And 
we have indeed restored pride and excellence to our public institutions of 
higher education. 
</P>
<P>
My message to the young people is that the benefits of staying in school will 
pay off every day, for the rest of your life. I urge you to remain with your 
education, and then your education will remain with you. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 I proposed, and we have implemented, a Children's Initiative designed 
to improve health care, day care and child support collections on behalf of the 
young, and to better protect them from abuse. 
</P>
<P>
And yet all our efforts will be squandered if we continue to allow the 
destruction of our young people by poisonous drugs. 
</P>
<P>
My new budget contains an additional $10 million to expand a life-saving effort 
we began last year -- drug education in our schools. With two-year expenditures 
totaling $54 million, we will now be able to include drug education in every 
school from grades four to eight. 
</P>
<P>
We must also take additional steps to stem the flow of illegal drugs coming 
across our borders. I am pleased to report that the federal government has 
approved the allocation of $10 million to the California National Guard to step 
up its work with local law enforcement agencies to stop the smuggling of drugs 
across our border. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, some have suggested that legalization is the solution to the drug 
problem. Well, they are dead wrong. We must never, never wave the white flag of 
surrender at the white plague of cocaine, and other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, our school-age population is growing at a rate 40% faster than our 
population as a whole. With that kind of growth, we can't depend simply on 
building our way out of the shortage of classrooms, even though we have 
completed nearly 700 school construction projects since 1983. My new budget 
contains an additional $1.6-billion bond proposal for school construction, but 
it will be accompanied by these additional proposals: 
</P>
<P>
First, we will provide strong financial incentives to districts which adopt a 
year-round school program, including special per-student payments and 
first-call on school construction bond funds. It is simply inexcusable and 
wasteful to allow school facilities to sit idle and unused for up to three 
months per year. 
</P>
<P>
Second, in order to encourage local districts who move toward year-round 
schools to enact their own local school bond measures, I would support a 
constitutional amendment to reduce to 60% the two-thirds vote that is now 
required for approval of those bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Californians are justly concerned about preserving the natural beauty and 
health of our environment and protecting it from air, water and toxic 
pollution. We have enacted the toughest laws in the nation, and we acquired and 
preserved thousands of acres of sensitive lands. Yet regrettably, our state is 
getting dirtier by the day -- not from those types of pollution, but from the 
garbage thrown on our streets and the graffiti plastered on our walls. It is 
time for California to clean up its act. 
</P>
<P>
I am proposing that we double the amount of litter cleanup work performed by 
Caltrans on our state's major urban freeways. We will also encourage 
neighborhoods, civic organizations and youth groups to "adopt a highway," and 
take the responsibility for keeping it clean. Also, I am instructing the 
California Highway Patrol to redouble its efforts to catch litterbugs in the 
act, pull them over and fine them. 
</P>
<P>
I want Californians to be able to take pride in their communities and their 
state once again. We must persuade, educate and insist that all residents 
respect our roads, freeways, walls, beaches, parks and neighborhoods -- and 
stop using them as their own personal garbage dump. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, let me say a few words about the new budget, which I will be 
submitting to you tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
The budget I am proposing is a balanced budget that contains a prudent reserve 
and no general tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
It is $3.4 billion more than the current-year budget. And I might add 
parenthetically that it is 100% bigger than my first budget in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance is projecting an 8.4% growth in general fund revenues 
in the coming year. Yet, under existing laws -- including entitlement programs, 
annual cost-of-living increases, caseload requirements and a constitutionally 
required prudent reserve -- the general fund budget would expand by more than 
11%. 
</P>
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, we must face reality. When you have laws requiring 
spending increases of 11% and additional income of 8.4%, it is evident that 
adjustments in some programs will be needed to bring the projected rise in 
spending in line with the projected rise in income. 
</P>
<P>
Any government which is programmed on autopilot to build its base budget by 11% 
a year, not including any new programs, is headed for trouble. The economy 
can't grow fast enough -- nor would the public stand for an annual automatic 
tax increase -- to sustain such an exorbitant level of government growth. 
</P>
<P>
And so, I will propose a number of reasonable and necessary legislative changes 
in some programs. But let me emphasize that this is my January budget proposal, 
which is based on the best information we can get at this time. Just as I did 
last year, I am prepared to sit down with the legislative leadership for as 
long as it takes in the coming months to achieve a consensus budget. 
</P>
<P>
My fellow Californians, as we begin the 1990s, we should be thankful that our 
state is stronger and more prosperous than it has ever been. Through common 
sense and through cooperation, we have achieved fiscal responsibility. We have 
restored economic excellence -- but now we have to preserve it, we have to 
protect it, we have to build upon it, and we have to make sure that it is 
equally shared. 
</P>
<P>
The initiatives I have put forward today represent an ambitious but compelling 
agenda for a state which in the 1990s will see its 29-million population grow 
by another 5 million residents, and where ethnic minority communities combined 
will constitute the majority. And please understand, I chose policies with my 
eyes fixed not on this governor but my eyes fixed on the future of California. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many others, I became a Californian not by birth but by choice. I 
adopted a state whose opportunities are as boundless as its beauty, whose 
future is as bright as its sunshine, and whose possibilities are as varied as 
its people. I want to preserve that kind of California for all of our children 
and our grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
As I enter my 28th and final year of public life, I am grateful for the 
opportunity the people have given me to serve them, beginning only seven years 
after my arrival in this state, with my first oath of office as an assemblyman 
in this chamber -- and ending as the leader of a state that is the leader of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
As most of you know, Gloria and I are first-generation Americans. Our parents 
struggled, they worked hard to give their children a better start in life than 
they have had. 
</P>
<P>
We have tried to do the same for our children, and as governor my goal was to 
leave California better than when I came into office. I believe that it is 
better than it was, and that is why literally millions of people have come here 
in the past few years seeking unlimited opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Together, we have done well, but I know we can do better. Despite some of our 
differences, we are bonded by our desire to pass along to the next generation 
the golden opportunities of the Golden State. There is still much to accomplish 
in this first year of the last decade of the 20th Century, so let's carry on in 
a spirit of unity and good will. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you very much.

GAS CO. GRANTED 1.2% HIKE IN RESIDENTIAL USERS' RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California Gas Co. will raise its rates for residential customers by 
1.2%, or about 60 cents a month, while rates for large industrial customers 
will fall 29.1% under rulings issued Tuesday by the state Public Utilities 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The new rates, which take effect once the gas company files paper work in the 
next three to five days, will boost the average residential customer's monthly 
gas bill to $24.80 from $24.20, the PUC said. 
</P>
<P>
The new rates will add about $121 million in revenues to cover added operating 
costs and the rising price of gas, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
That revenue increase is less than the $135 million that the gas company 
sought, but is considerably more than the $47 million increase recommended by 
the Division of Ratepayer Advocates, a unit of the PUC staff that argues on 
behalf of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer groups saw Tuesday's PUC rulings as a continuation of recent decisions 
that seem to shift some of the utility's operating costs from heavy industrial 
users to residential and small commercial customers. In the past, large 
industrial customers have subsidized the other users. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be fairly indicative of PUC decisions lately, that the heavy 
weight seems to be falling on the small customers," said Michel Florio, a 
lawyer with the private consumer advocacy group Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization. 
</P>
<P>
In recommending the $121-million revenue increase, the PUC granted most of the 
company's requests to improve aging equipment, as well as for $20.5 million for 
conservation and low-income programs, said PUC Administrative Law Judge Bertram 
Patrick. But the PUC agreed with the Division of Ratepayer Advocates that the 
gas company should cut administrative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC also rejected a request by the company to raise its monthly service 
charge to $5 from $3.10. 
</P>
<P>
"The single biggest reason for the increase in the core (residential and small 
commercial customer) rates is that the estimates of the costs of long-term gas 
supplies went up," said Paul Clanon, a PUC staff member. "The reason non-core 
(large industrial customer) rates went down is that they did not include any 
estimate of future gas costs; they buy their own gas." 
</P>
<P>
Of Southern California Gas' 4.5 million customers, 900 are large industrial 
users, who pay the company for use of its pipeline network. Roy Rawlings, a gas 
company vice president for regulatory affairs, added that the utility assumes 
the risk of doing business with large industrial customers. If revenues do not 
cover costs, then the utility must swallow the loss. 
</P>
<P>
The new rates resulted from the PUC's decision on Southern California Gas' 1 
1/2-year-long general rate case proceeding, its first in five years, under 
which the commission examined the utility's overall cost of operation and 
estimated the revenue the utility will need to run in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the PUC revised the so-called baseline allowance, or the 
amount of gas that can be purchased at low rates. In the summer, a customer who 
uses up to 19 therms of gas will pay 39.47 cents per therm, an increase from 
36.68 cents. The same rate applies in the winter, but the baseline allowance 
was lowered to 55 therms from 62 therms. 
</P>
<P>
Customers who use more than the baseline allowance will pay 75 cents per therm, 
which was reduced from 78.10 cents. A therm is equal to 100,000 BTUs.

Jennifer Jean Casolo, the Connecticut woman deported from El Salvador after 18 
days in prison on charges of stockpiling weapons for leftist rebels, said 
Tuesday that she has received threatening hate mail since her return home. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles to launch an 11-city speaking tour, Casolo recounted details of 
her arrest on Nov. 25, the night Salvadoran police raided her rented home and 
allegedly unearthed more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, grenades and 
explosives buried in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo, who coordinated tours of church workers and congressional aides to El 
Salvador, reasserted her innocence in a news conference at the First Baptist 
Church in Koreatown and suggested that Salvadoran authorities may have framed 
her to discredit all church workers. 
</P>
<P>
"If it was a setup, I was a good person to choose," Casolo, 28, said. "The work 
we were doing there was gaining more credibility and breadth." 
</P>
<P>
Casolo has maintained that she did not know where the arms came from. Her 
arrest came during a fierce guerrilla offensive and a crackdown by the 
U.S.-backed government on dissidents and the church. 
</P>
<P>
Citing a lack of evidence, the Salvadoran government ordered Casolo released on 
Dec. 13 and expelled her from the country. President Alfredo Cristiani said, 
however, that he remained "morally convinced" of Casolo's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
As an indication of how the highly publicized case inflamed public emotions, 
Casolo said that about half a dozen letters -- of the several hundred mailed to 
her -- have been hateful or threatening. A couple simply said, "Drop dead." 
</P>
<P>
In one two-page letter, the writer opened with the greeting, "You ignorant 
terrorist slut," and warned her she did not have long to live. Other letters 
merely urged her to "apologize" to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The hate mail, she said, has been outweighed by support. She credits the 
American public's outrage at her detention with leading to her release. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo now plans to press her message -- that U.S. military aid to El Salvador 
has backfired -- in appearances at churches, community centers and, ultimately, 
the U.S. Congress, where she will testify later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo conceded that she used her back yard to bury personal items and 
pamphlets that instructed peasants on how to make posters. She said the items 
were hidden to keep them from government troops who were raiding the offices 
and homes of other church workers. 
</P>
<P>
She suggested that her trouble may have started after she telephoned the 
offices of two U.S. congressmen to complain about the Salvadoran air force's 
aerial attacks on poor neighborhoods where rebels took up positions. 
</P>
<P>
The same night she said she received an obscene phone call from a man speaking 
English with a Spanish accent. A week later, she spotted police staked out near 
her house, and four days later her home was raided. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo is also scheduled to speak at churches in Pasadena and Westwood, before 
she travels Friday to San Francisco and other cities. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Casolo was a guest on a KABC radio talk show with broadcaster 
Michael Jackson, where she took calls from listeners -- split evenly between 
the sympathetic and the critical, including one man who suggested many of the 
church workers in El Salvador are communists. 
</P>
<P>
Casolo said she wants to return to El Salvador someday, but added: "If I were 
there now, I know there would be a bull's-eye on my back," she said.

President Bush on Tuesday praised Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s courage in the 
face of threats and promised to "bring to justice the bigots" responsible for a 
wave of bombings against civil rights leaders two decades after King's death. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, a prime target of the 
hate campaign, emerged from the Oval Office saying he was "fairly satisfied" 
with federal efforts to solve the bombings, but was seeking further assurance 
"that from the presidency down there is a sense of urgency." 
</P>
<P>
Bush invited civil rights leaders and students to the White House to witness 
his signing of a proclamation in connection with Monday's holiday marking 
King's birthday.

OIL SPILL BILL MUST BE WATERED DOWN

A proposal to impose hefty fees on oil companies to build an oil spill cleanup 
fund and to make company employees and officials criminally liable for spills 
suffered a major setback in a state Senate panel. The Natural Resources 
Committee, which generally is friendly to environmental causes, approved the 
measure to keep it alive, but with the understanding that the author will 
present a new, less stringent bill. The decision upset the plans of the 
measure's Democratic backers -- Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy and Controller Gray 
Davis -- who wanted to move it through the Legislature quickly so oil companies 
would have less time to pick it apart.

No traces of illicit drugs were found in the bodies of three victims of the 
early morning collision of an Amtrak train and a tractor-trailer rig last 
month, according to a spokesman for the San Joaquin County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's report found that the truck driver, David Haskell, died of 
"extreme blunt force trauma" and that two train crew members died of burns. 
More than 50 people suffered minor injuries in the Dec. 19 accident, which took 
place in heavy fog about five miles southeast of Stockton. Train fireman 
Michael G. Passarella, 41, of San Francisco, and engineer Edward E. McMillon, 
48, of Hayward, both died in their seats in the charred locomotive, according 
to the report.

POWER STRUGGLE IN IRAN LEADS TO ARREST OF CLERIC

A former deputy to Iran's late leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was 
briefly arrested during the weekend amid a renewed power struggle in Iran, an 
Iranian exile group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad-based Moujahedeen Khalq organization said in a statement 
distributed in Athens that the senior cleric, the Ayatollah Hussein Ali 
Montazeri, was arrested Saturday in the holy city of Qom, 75 miles south of 
Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
He was released hours later after tension built up in the city over news of his 
arrest, the exile group said. There was no immediate confirmation of the arrest 
from independent sources, but on Monday, Iran's new spiritual leader, the 
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on Iranians to unite and issued a warning to 
those causing divisions. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, whose message was addressed to the Majlis, or Parliament, and 
broadcast on Tehran Radio, said he will not tolerate attacks on the principle 
of rule of the clergy on which the Islamic Republic of Iran was founded. 
</P>
<P>
Khamenei did not indicate who attacked the principle recently, but reports from 
Tehran said demonstrators in Qom chanted slogans against the principle last 
week. It was not immediately clear if the demonstrators were Montazeri 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The Moujahedeen, bitter opponents of Iran's ruling clerics, said Montazeri was 
arrested after he issued strong statements attacking President Hashemi 
Rafsanjani and Khamenei. 
</P>
<P>
The Moujahedeen, who said they received their information from contacts inside 
Iran, said that supporters of the president and Iran's new spiritual leader 
staged a demonstration outside Montazeri's house the day before he was 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Montazeri, who was ousted in April as Khomeini's deputy and designated 
successor just two months before the ayatollah died, was engaged in a power 
struggle against Rafsanjani and Khamenei at least four years earlier.

BRONCOS: HUMPHREY'S FOOT INJURIES SCARED SOME TEAMS IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL DRAFT, 
BUT DENVER IS HAPPY TO HAVE HIM.

<P>
He's young, he's hot, he's today. He has a diamond in his left ear and an 
avant-garde 'do, with the sides shaved and the hair upright on top. The effect 
is of a bowling ball with a brush cut, or a younger Don King. 
</P>
<P>
He's Bobby Humphrey, long-sought answer to the Broncos' prayers, as they were 
to his. 
</P>
<P>
With 1,150 yards in his rookie season, despite not having started until Week 5, 
he has just posted the third-best Bronco rushing total of all time. He is 
already their No. 11 career rusher. 
</P>
<P>
How did they get him? 
</P>
<P>
All they had to do was summon their courage and step up after 16 teams had 
passed Humphrey over in last July's supplemental draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys and the Phoenix Cardinals took quarterbacks Steve Walsh and 
Timm Rosenbach. Fourteen teams preferred no one at all to the one-time Alabama 
Heisman Trophy candidate . . . with the twice stress-fractured bone in his 
right foot . . . who had spent eight of the preceding 12 months in a cast . . . 
who, upon recovery, ran 4.7-second 40-yard dashes for pro scouts where he had 
once run 4.5s. 
</P>
<P>
How did the Broncos feel about their coup? 
</P>
<P>
Before the draft, they hadn't dared hope Humphrey would last until their pick. 
</P>
<P>
Once it was over, they wondered what everyone knew that they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"You start saying, 'Whoa, man,' " Coach Dan Reeves says. "You know a lot of 
teams passed this guy up. Are you sure this is what you want to do?" 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Tuscaloosa . . . 
</P>
<P>
Humphrey figured he'd go in the first five picks. One of those selections was 
owned by Tampa Bay, whose coach, Ray Perkins, had recruited him, coached him 
for two seasons and was said to regard him like a son. The Buccaneers needed a 
running back and had arranged the workout at Tuscaloosa, where Humphrey ran 
those slow 40s. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers then decided that their traditionally high pick was too much to 
gamble; they hoped to steal Humphrey on the second round, for which they'd have 
to give up only a No. 2 choice in the next draft. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they were trying to fool everyone, and never told Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
"I really wasn't upset," Humphrey says. "I was kinda disappointed. I didn't 
know a small bone could cause so much problem, but it did." 
</P>
<P>
Remember Keith Byars? Once he was rated a hair behind Bo Jackson. Stress 
fractures slowed Byars down, and now he's an ordinary back with a career 
average of 3.4 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
Bronco doctors had assured Reeves that Humphrey's fracture had healed. In 
minicamp, Reeves saw Humphrey run and stopped worrying. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if desperate is the right word," Reeves says. "I don't think you 
have many chances, when you pick where we pick, to get that type of running 
back. I can remember being excited about Neal Anderson (when he left Florida in 
1986), for example, and we didn't have a first-round choice. And I couldn't 
believe the Chicago Bears ended up getting him with the last pick in the first 
round. Those types of running backs don't usually hang around very long." 
</P>
<P>
Reeves may have been anxious. All he ever had at Denver in the 1980s were slow 
backs like Sammy Winder. Or pass-catchers like Steve Sewell. Or little ones 
like Gerald Willhite. Or little, old ones like Tony Dorsett, who was 34 and two 
years past his last 1,000-yard season when the Broncos got him. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Broncos still hadn't signed Humphrey, nor would they until the 
25th day of camp. Humphrey and teammate-to-be Melvin Bratton cooled themselves 
out in Birmingham, Ala., lifting weights and waiting for news. 
</P>
<P>
"He was, like, nervous and 'bout to go crazy," Bratton says. "I'm, like, 'Look, 
just be quiet and shut up 'cause I'm a veteran at this game (Bratton tore up a 
knee as a Miami senior, was a No. 6 pick of the Dolphins but didn't sign, 
preferring to go back into the draft).' So I knew how to ignore the newspapers. 
'Cause if you read 'em, you just go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Humphrey signed . . . and big things happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I never expected these things, not at all," he says. "A lot of it is shocking 
because everything happened to me so late. 
</P>
<P>
"I was only in camp three or four days before the last (exhibition) game, and I 
didn't do so well in that. Then I bruised a thigh and I couldn't maneuver the 
way I wanted. I knew all along it could be done, but I didn't think it could be 
done this year. I had no idea I would come right in and be a starter." 
</P>
<P>
In his first start, he ran for 102 yards against the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
In his most recent, he gained 85 yards -- for a 4.6 average -- during Sunday's 
24-23 playoff victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good idea it was going to be a high-intensity ballgame, but I didn't 
have any idea it was going to be like that, the way everybody was flying 
around, getting to the football, making the big hit," Humphrey says. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a lot of excitement. It's different. I tried to compare it to an 
Alabama-Auburn game, but the intensity might be a little higher. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been told the Browns really get up, so we're going to have to strap it 
on. We're going to have to put on two helmets, two pairs of shoulder pads. 
We're going to have to put on everything 'cause they're really going to come 
out there (Sunday, when Cleveland plays Denver at Mile High Stadium for the AFC 
championship)." 
</P>
<P>
He and Bratton remain inseparable. "They're both characters," Reeves says. 
"They're both good people to have around you because they're loose. They don't 
let the people around them get uptight." 
</P>
<P>
What's not to laugh about? You know what Humphrey was doing a year ago? 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting around, moping," he says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time, I was probably still thinking about what was I going to do, as 
far as coming out of college and going into the draft, or coming back and 
playing at Alabama. I was still in a cast, limping around. That's about it." 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the big time. Make way, Jon Keyworth, Rob Lytle, Rick Parros and 
Dave Preston, there's a new bucking Bronc on the list, No. 11 with a bullet.

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS TEAM WILL REIGN ON A PARADE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Aguy asked a good question on a radio call-in show. When the Rams win the Super 
Bowl, he wondered, will Georgia Frontiere hold the victory parade in Los 
Angeles (the team's name) or in Anaheim (the team's home)? 
</P>
<P>
Personally, I think the parade should start in one town and finish in the 
other. Considering California traffic, I figure it'll take only two or three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, let's have a parade, shall we? Win or lose the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Rams are going to the Super Bowl, you know. 
</P>
<P>
That sound you just heard was John Robinson throwing the breakfast dishes. 
</P>
<P>
He hates to read stuff like this. Hates to hear talk like this. 
</P>
<P>
You know, cocky talk. 
</P>
<P>
He's afraid the San Francisco 49ers will tack it up on their bulletin board and 
then accuse the Rams of being too cocky. 
</P>
<P>
Big-mouth Buddy Ryan and the bigger-mouth Philadelphia Eagles tried it, and 
just look at what the Rams did to them. They stuck it to the Eagles, 
horns-first. All that cheap talk by the Eagles really got the Rams' goats. 
</P>
<P>
So, let me make this perfectly clear, right up front. This isn't the Rams 
talking big. It's me talking big about the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
They are going to beat the 49ers for the NFC championship Sunday at Candlestick 
Park, trust me. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because they're there. 
</P>
<P>
And then we all go dancing in downtown New Orleans for Super Bowl XXIV, in 
which the Rams, who originated in Cleveland, will be playing . . . ta-da! 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it's going to be a Super Bowl pitting the original Los Angeles Rams 
against the current Los Angeles Rams, neither of whom play in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Start planning the parade. 
</P>
<P>
Look, you know and I know that it's not wise to underestimate the San Francisco 
49ers. They have the quarterback, Joe (Magic) Montana, and the Roger Craig who 
doesn't manage the baseball team, and today's catch-of-the-day specials, Jerry 
Rice and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
They also have this coach, George Seifert, who replaced Bill Walsh and 
resembles Bob Uecker. The guy's done a nice job. He's no "genius" like Walsh, 
but he's at least a semi-genius. 
</P>
<P>
It just won't be enough. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are primed for prime-time. They are ready to stop fooling around with 
this daytime stuff and start playing late-night football, just the way CBS and 
NBC and ABC like it. 
</P>
<P>
They learned their lesson the last time they played at night, that terrible 
Monday against San Francisco. They learned that you have to keep playing for 
all four quarters, no matter how late it's getting to be. And they learned to 
put as many points on the board as possible, because against the Niners, too 
many points aren't enough. 
</P>
<P>
If the Rams are leading, say, 27-3, in the fourth quarter Sunday, don't turn 
off your television sets. The 49ers may just be getting warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
I'm taking the Rams in this game, though, and I don't care who knows it. I'm 
picking my team, pulling for my boys. Call me Homer. 
</P>
<P>
Beat S.F.! 
</P>
<P>
Beat S.F.! 
</P>
<P>
Beat S.F.! 
</P>
<P>
So, no more of that negative-media stuff from any of you people out there. I've 
had it with that. I am behind my Rams this week, 110%. No, make it 115. This is 
our year. 
</P>
<P>
I like the Rams a lot, because they are an exciting offensive team, because 
they are a scrappy defensive team, and because they are not moving to Oakland 
or Sacramento. I hate it when teams move to Oakland or Sacramento, don't you? I 
know Kansas City does. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game should be pretty entertaining. The 49ers and Craig probably will 
try to run on the Rams, having seen the way the New York Giants plowed through 
the Doug Reed-less L.A. defense. On the other hand, the Giants ran at the Rams 
for four quarters of football, and still scored only 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams may try to exploit a suspect San Francisco offensive line. Yet, this 
same line held off Minnesota last week, keeping Montana from being sacked even 
once. I expect Kevin Greene and his Ram-tough friends to take this as a 
personal challenge. Come on, boys, don't rain on my parade. 
</P>
<P>
The big thing for the Rams is to believe. To believe they can do it. To believe 
the 49ers can be beaten. That's half the fight. These guys aren't unbeatable, 
for heaven's sake. Green Bay beat the 49ers. The Rams beat Green Bay. Heck, the 
Rams beat the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
I sincerely believe that the Rams are ready to rock and roll. If the 49ers want 
to put that on their bulletin board, let them. I'll do the talking for the 
Rams. You won't hear a peep out of them this week, so I'll take care of their 
peeping. The Rams are going to win. 
</P>
<P>
There, that wasn't so negative, was it?

RAMS SIGN JOHNNIE JOHNSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Rams reached into their golden oldies pile Tuesday and plucked out a hit 
from the 1980s, safety Johnnie Johnson, who agreed to terms on a two-game 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
What? Why? How? 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 33, was left unprotected by the Rams after the 1988 season and signed 
as a Plan B free agent with the Seattle Seahawks, who released him after two 
games this season. 
</P>
<P>
A starter at safety for most of the last decade, and one of the more popular 
Rams of his era, Johnson was a logical short-term solution to what has become a 
desperate situation in the secondary, where the Rams are losing the battle of 
attrition. 
</P>
<P>
The team already is without safety Anthony Newman, who has an elbow injury, and 
cornerback Clifford Hicks, who has a knee problem. 
</P>
<P>
Two more defenders, starting free safety Vincent Newsome and reserve cornerback 
Darryl Henley, were knocked from Sunday's playoff win over the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are listing Newsome, who sprained an ankle, as questionable for this 
week's NFC title game against San Francisco, although Henley, with a shoulder 
sprain, now appears probable. 
</P>
<P>
Need a safety? Whom do you call? The Rams dialed Johnson, retired and selling 
real estate in Westminster for his company, ERA All-Pro. 
</P>
<P>
"At least he's well rested," Ram Coach John Robinson said. "Our biggest problem 
is that he sells real estate, and he has an open house Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said he was planning to show a house that day, but there's a Super Bowl 
at stake. Johnson was a first-round pick in 1980, the spring after the Rams' 
one and only Super Bowl appearance. 
</P>
<P>
As careers go, Johnson said he still had some loose ends to tie up. 
</P>
<P>
"The year before I got here, the Rams got to the Super Bowl," he said. "If 
they'd have gone the year after I left, I don't know if that would have settled 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's role against the 49ers will be strictly as a reserve. Robinson said 
he probably wouldn't allow Johnson to practice this week, for fear of 
stretching dormant muscles. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson has always been slight of build, and doesn't appear an ounce over his 
playing weight of 183 pounds. Of course, putting on a helmet and chasing Jerry 
Rice after selling houses for four-months is another story. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson sells real estate; Rice devours it. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't play a large number of plays," he said. "But you can play one game on 
adrenaline alone." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's news wasn't a complete surprise. The Rams and Johnson had maintained 
contact since his release by the Seahawks on Sept. 19. Johnson started the 
first two games for Seattle this season, but admitted his aging knees couldn't 
take the pounding on the Kingdome's artificial surface. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were interested in signing Johnson before the New England game Dec. 
24, he said, but the teams couldn't work out the compensation details involving 
Johnson's Seattle contract. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said those problems have been resolved, and he is ready to become a Ram 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an opportunity to play for the ring," he said. "In 10 years, I never got 
that opportunity. I came close in '85, and here it is again." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that he nearly signed with the 49ers, after their strong safety, 
Jeff Fuller, was seriously injured Oct. 22 against New England. The 49ers 
elected instead to activate cornerback Tim McKyer, who was serving a three-game 
suspension for disciplinary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's heart, obviously, remains with the Rams. He said his real estate 
business has boomed with the success of the Rams this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I get calls every day," Johnson said. "Some people still think I'm playing for 
the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson did that for nine seasons, finishing up his first tour of duty with 21 
interceptions. He led the Rams with four interceptions in 1988, but his age was 
a liability, so the Rams left him unprotected last Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wasn't bitter about the Rams' decision at the time, and seemed excited 
about the opportunity to make some late-career money in the open market. He 
signed with Seattle in March. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was expected to sign his contract late Tuesday night or Wednesday 
morning. The Rams issued him a playbook for this week's game. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining decisions are minor, such as what uniform number Johnson will 
wear. His old issue, No. 20, was given to rookie Darryl Henley. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something Darryl and I can work out tomorrow," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
John the prophet: Robinson's postgame speech to his team after their 30-27 loss 
to the 49ers on Dec. 11 should be made available on cassette. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson predicted after a heart-breaking loss at Anaheim Stadium that his team 
would win four consecutive games and meet San Francisco for the NFC 
championship. Apparently, it stirred young minds and souls. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very valuable," quarterback Jim Everett said. "We've got a lot of young 
guys on this team that look to his leadership, his guiding word. And it came 
true." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said it was more than a case of pulling a speech from an old coaching 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Why couldn't we win four in a row?" he said. "It's for the non-participants to 
doubt. The person that proposes to do something can't afford to doubt, or be 
cynical. What the hell? You've got to be willing to say, 'We're going to do 
it.' Otherwise, you give yourself no chance." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are 3-8 in championship games, dating back to a 1945 loss when the 
franchise still played in Cleveland. The Rams lost NFC title games in 1974, 
'75, '76, '78 and '85. They won their only NFC championship in 1979, when they 
defeated Tampa Bay, 9-0. . . . The Rams are 7-3 in road games this season. Joe 
Montana is 8-0 as a starter at Anaheim Stadium. So who's complaining about road 
trips? "It doesn't make a difference," Ram quarterback Jim Everett said. 
"Candlestick is fine. If you look at the statistics, let's play it there." 
</P>
<P>
So you think Everett's all milquetoast and noncontroversial? Tuesday, he 
contemplated life as a Houston Oiler, the team that drafted him in the first 
round in 1986. "I thank God that I didn't have a chance to be coached by Jerry 
Glanville," he said. "They've got great talent in Houston. I never believed 
they had great coaching." The Rams acquired Everett from Houston in September 
of 1986. . . . The Rams have released Paul Butcher, acquired last week for 
special teams duty against New York. John Robinson said Butcher could be 
re-signed later this week. 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Irvin rises again Dept: Robinson said the 10-year veteran cornerback 
played his best game of the season against the Giants. . . . Fatigue factor, 
Round 4. Robinson said he felt fine Tuesday. As goes Robinson, so go the Rams. 
"I am the consultant," he said. "We've just said we're not going to be tired. 
It's inconvenient for us to be tired." What about Monday? "I was beat," 
Robinson said. "I didn't sleep well Sunday night. I saw a lot of (Jerry) Rice 
in my sleep."

SIMMS FACING CLOUDY FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phil Simms walked briskly through the players parking lot at Giants Stadium 
Monday, wearing sunglasses and a grim look. 
</P>
<P>
Simms, whose answers were laced with expletives when he was cornered by the 
media after the New York Giants' 19-13 overtime playoff loss to the Los Angeles 
Rams Sunday, did not acknowledge reporters or the cameras pointed at him. His 
gaze remained fixed on what was in front of him until he turned the corner 
leading to the sanctuary of the Giants locker room. 
</P>
<P>
It had been a rough 24 hours for Simms. His sub-par, 14-for-29 performance, 
especially the momentum-turning interception at the end of the first half, had 
been universally criticized. 
</P>
<P>
Simms' play could come under even closer scrutiny when the Giants open training 
camp this summer. For the first time since 1983, there may be an open 
competition for quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Bill Parcells wouldn't divulge his quarterback plans for next season nor 
did he deny Simms may be forced to beat out Jeff Hostetler to retain his job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something (competition at quarterback) that I have to think about pretty 
strongly," Parcells said. "But I'm not saying what I'm going to do at this 
point because I don't think I should. It's something I'm going to have to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, anytime you have a player who is 34 years old you have to think (about 
it)." 
</P>
<P>
Parcells went out of his way to praise Simms, saying he was happy with Simms 
and thought he did "an excellent job" this season. But Parcells has never been 
this ambiguous about Simms' status. 
</P>
<P>
Since Simms and Scott Brunner competed for the job in 1983, the assumption has 
been that Simms was the quarterback unless injuries prevented him from playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he would care (if the position was thrown open)," Parcells said. 
"I could trade for Dan Marino and he'd say, 'Bring him in here and let's see 
who's the best.' That's the type of competitor he is." 
</P>
<P>
After he attended a team meeting and cleaned out his locker, Simms made only 
one comment before he drove away in his white Jaguar XJS. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough year. It was a bad way to end it," he said. "I'm sorry about 
it. I mean I'm unhappy about it. I wish it could be different, but it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Simms skipped the first three weeks of training camp before signing a 
three-year contract worth approximately $4.2 million, a deal that takes him 
through the 1991 season. Before his holdout, Simms had been one of the 
lowest-paid starting quarterbacks in the league, but the new contract pushed 
him into the Top 10 in quarterback salaries. 
</P>
<P>
But, in many regards, this was Simms' toughest year since knee and thumb 
injuries knocked him out of all but two games in the 1982-83 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He suffered chest, thumb and ankle injuries, missing most of the Minnesota game 
and a start against the Cardinals with a severely sprained right ankle. The 
ankle limited his mobility the rest of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Simms also struggled under the constraints of the Giants' conservative offense. 
When the running game struggled, Simms often was forced to throw in 
third-and-long situations. 
</P>
<P>
When the Giants did throw, the pass blocking of the young offensive line was 
inconsistent. In the losses to the 49ers and Eagles -- games in which the 
Giants were forced to pass -- Simms committed seven turnovers that were 
converted into 38 points. 
</P>
<P>
For the season, he completed 228 of 405 passes for 3,061 yards with 14 
touchdowns and 14 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"Hand the ball off in the non-obvious situations and to convert the 
third-and-longs. That was Phil's job," center Bart Oates said. "I thought there 
was more pressure on him in that situation. It's probably a little easier for a 
quarterback when you have a good running game to throw off play-action. 
</P>
<P>
"But we went away from the play-action, from what we've done in the past. His 
job description changed somewhat this year." 
</P>
<P>
Hostetler, 28, had thrown only 29 passes in his first five seasons, but played 
fairly well in leading the Giants to victories over the Vikings and Cardinals. 
Parcells said after the Phoenix game that he was confident Hostetler could 
perform in a starting role. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know. I think it (a competition at quarterback) is more realistic than 
it's ever been," Hostetler said. "I have another year under my belt. ... I 
don't know what's going to happen, but I'll try to make the best of it."

MELVIN DURSLAG: THE SPLENDOR THAT WAS THE COLISEUM NOW IS IN EYE OF BEHOLDER

<P>
Whether the current pro football tenant remains in the Coliseum, or another is 
solicited, it is increasingly clear that folks down there are dealing with a 
stadium as dated as the sleeve garter. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is one that the senior occupant of the stadium, USC, also 
addresses. USC played the first football game in the Coliseum. Humbled the 
Pomona Sagehens, 23-7, in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona is long gone from USC's life, but the Coliseum isn't, a lingering 
detriment to a school picturing itself as one of the foremost producers of 
amateur football teams, remanded to an inside cabin. 
</P>
<P>
It always has been, and remains, the unclouded view here that every major city 
should treat itself to a stadium twice a century. Sports is part of the 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
And it usually happens that revenues generated by the stadium will pay it off, 
or come close. 
</P>
<P>
A village at the time of only 160,000, Anaheim took a flyer on a stadium in 
1966. It hit big, not only as a good investment, but as a comfortable gathering 
place, pleasing to the populace. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Seattle, San 
Diego, East Rutherford, Houston, Dallas, Buffalo, New Orleans, Minneapolis, 
Tampa, Kansas City and countless others -- all able to get new stadiums off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
But you suggest tearing down the Coliseum in Los Angeles and replacing it with 
something contemporary, and you will be told this amounts to desecration of a 
historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Merely to lay a chisel to the place, you've got to deal with a Historic 
Building Code Board, not to mention an Office of Historic Preservation, neither 
of which would let you proceed without a fund of compelling reasons. 
</P>
<P>
They might even invoke the Geneva Convention. 
</P>
<P>
The question posed here is why was the Coliseum, to begin with, designated a 
historic landmark? 
</P>
<P>
The place is a knockoff. The original is sitting there in Rome. If you go down 
to Tijuana and buy a "Louis Vuitton" for $8, are you getting a Louis Vuitton? 
</P>
<P>
The Roman Colosseum was begun in the year 75 by Emperor Vespasian, who ordered 
40,000 to 50,000 seats. He wanted something intimate, giving the lions the 
home-field edge in the event of a contest. Since the crowd-noise rule hadn't 
yet been instituted, audibles would be tough for those opposing the cats. 
</P>
<P>
Well, in 1952, it occurred to the Coliseum Commission in Los Angeles that it 
would be nice to decorate the grand entrance of its stadium with a piece of 
stone from the original Roman edifice. 
</P>
<P>
The only trouble was, the Italian government said no. So did our State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
But the story goes that A. P. Giannini, the late banker with connections in the 
old country, worked a quiet deal whereby a two-ton piece of the Colosseum was 
placed, under cover of night, on a dray wagon and hauled to a freighter, which 
brought the prize to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
So the stone now reposing at the Coliseum, depicting what is called there "the 
grandeur that was Rome," actually is hot. 
</P>
<P>
And this place is designated a historic landmark? 
</P>
<P>
When the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958 and asked to use the Coliseum as 
a temporary home, a major ruckus developed over a charge of desecration of the 
"historic architecture." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers had proposed to put home plate in the west end, near the tunnel, 
and construct a left-field fence on the north side of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Sacrilege, the commission cried. Anyone who would deface that precious concrete 
with a garish fence would paint a mustache on the Mona Lisa. The commission 
ordered the Dodgers to set up home plate in the east, or go back to Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't put home plate in the east," a Dodger spokesman protested. "For day 
games, batters would be looking into the sun. There aren't enough neurosurgeons 
in Los Angeles to look after the beaning victims who would be brought in." 
</P>
<P>
At that point, a genius from Arcadia appeared at the commission office, 
proposing a solution -- a captive balloon, 50 feet in circumference, which 
would float above the west rim of the stadium, shielding batters' eyes from the 
sinking sun. 
</P>
<P>
Politely, the Dodgers rejected the plan and faced a shutout when the 
commission, as a contribution to the city, yielded to the left-field fence, but 
only with assurance from the Dodgers that when they moved out, they would 
restore the "historic architecture" to its original pristine beauty. 
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum is so threadbare that one can't even lower the windows in the 
press box. The glass is too pitted for observers to see through it. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't lower it," guys in the second row yell. "We can't see." 
</P>
<P>
"Do you want to see, or die of exposure?" they are asked. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, you've got a beef on your hands. 
</P>
<P>
But the Coliseum Commission needn't concern itself with matters so earthly. It 
has a rendezvous with history, preserving the heritage of its knockoff stadium, 
embodying all the grandeur that was Rome.

After the 1971 season, the University of Oregon Alumni Assn. asked football 
Coach Jerry Frei either to fire his assistants or resign. He resigned. And his 
assistants left the school with him. Wonder whatever happened to two of them, 
named John Robinson and George Seifert. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Frei, incidentally, is now a scout for the Denver Broncos. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"If I could change anything in my seven years with the Rams," says Robinson, 
"it would be to have the 49ers in the Canadian League.". . . . 
</P>
<P>
Teams winning the coin toss in overtime have won only five of 11 NFL postseason 
games. And Sunday against the Giants, the Rams became the first team to score 
on the opening series of plays.. . . 
</P>
<P>
Terry Donahue's recruiting coup of the year would be to lure Homer Smith back 
as UCLA offensive coordinator. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Listening to Terry Bradshaw is fun. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Bill Walsh is so critical on the air of teams he has nothing to do with, 
imagine how difficult it must have been to play for him. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Notice that Bud Carson is calling for the officials to enforce the crowd 
noise-interference rule this week at Denver after not saying a word about it 
before last week's Browns-Buffalo game at Cleveland? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Donald Trump wasn't the only surprise guest in Art Modell's box Sunday. Also 
seen on TV was Don Klosterman, the former Ram general manager who belongs 
somewhere in the NFL. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bronko Nagurski, who made the All-American team at defensive tackle in 1929, 
was known as the "Paul Bunyan" of football. He stood 6-feet-2 and weighed 230 
pounds, still big enough for a fullback, but not for a defensive tackle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If they perform half as well as they talk, Juan Samuel, Hubie Brooks, Jim Gott 
and Mike Maddux will be worthwhile additions to the Dodgers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The highlight tape of these four players shown the other day at the Stadium 
Club included footage of Maddux getting Chris Gwynn out on a called third 
strike. Gwynn also happens to be a member of the Dodger organization. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's come-from-behind victory over Michigan Monday night must rank as one 
of the greatest wins of the Bobby Knight era. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps less surprising was Nevada Las Vegas' come-from-ahead loss to New 
Mexico State in hostile Las Cruces, N.M., where it was billed as the game of 
the century. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Big East and the Big Ten get more attention, but the Big Eight has three 
teams in the top five of the wire-service college basketball rankings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Arizona State insisted on playing USC this Saturday in the afternoon as 
planned, but it could backfire. For a change, the Trojans will have a definite 
home-court advantage in cozy Lyon Center. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing has developed into a dominant center in his fifth NBA season 
because he has built up his upper body and is far more aggressive on the 
offensive end. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The poor man's John Henry, King's Swan, made his 1990 racing debut as a 
10-year-old by finishing third in the Grade III Aqueduct Handicap. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Brian Mayberry, the early leader in the trainers' standings at Santa Anita, is 
particularly good with first-time starters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It got ridiculous Sunday, but this usually is a crazy time of the year at Santa 
Anita. Lots of shippers and horses coming off layoffs make for upsets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Marv Albert, John Davidson and Mike Emrick will be the announcers on Jan. 21 
when NBC televises the NHL All-Star game. The network hasn't shown an NHL game 
since the 1975 Stanley Cup, when Tim Ryan did the play-by-play and Ted Lindsay 
the commentary. . . .

WILL RAM OPPORTUNITY KNOCK?

The question is whether a team of opportunists, the Rams, can win Sunday when 
the San Francisco 49ers are at the top of their game -- when they are more 
effective, offensively, than they were at any time in the 1980s, during which 
they won three Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
After last week's games in Candlestick Park and Giants Stadium, the most 
pertinent answers came from two of the better players on the losing teams: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The NFL's defensive player of the year, tackle Keith Millard of the 
Minnesota Vikings, said: "(The 49ers) won't be beaten the rest of the year. It 
doesn't matter who they play." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gary Reasons of the New York Giants, one of the NFL's steadiest 
linebackers, said: "I don't see the Rams beating the 49ers right now. They 
didn't play well enough (last Sunday) to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
What's happened in San Francisco lately is that quarterback Joe Montana and his 
teammates and their coaches -- all of them handpicked by former coach Bill 
Walsh -- have raised offensive football to a new level. 
</P>
<P>
Probably no other 49er offensive team -- perhaps no offensive group anywhere, 
any time -- could have done what the 49ers did to a great defensive team in the 
first half Sunday: four Montana touchdown passes and 95 yards running by 
halfback Roger Craig for a 27-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That was Walsh football. Same system. Same team. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference is that as coached by George Seifert, the 49ers have been 
even better. The reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their main players are more mature. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As a team, they have been relatively injury-free this season, improbably, 
for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And unlike most defending Super Bowl champions, their players are all 
highly motivated. 
</P>
<P>
Said 49er safety Tom Holmoe: "There are a lot of guys here who would like to 
see how we do without (Walsh)." 
</P>
<P>
That, no doubt, is most of it. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter last Sunday, the 49ers were ahead by only 7-3 when the 
Vikings outguessed them and blanketed Montana's primary receiver at the 
Minnesota eight-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
At that moment, 49er tight end Brent Jones, who was racing left at the left 
hash mark, looked back at Montana, saw the problem and changed direction 
instantly, racing laterally to his right through the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Simultaneously, Montana rolled right at high speed and, shortly before rolling 
out of bounds, whipped the ball to Jones shortly before he ran out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
The play had the look of The Catch in 1981 when a similar running pass to wide 
receiver Dwight Clark defeated Dallas in the last minute of the NFC title game 
and launched the 49ers' Super Bowl dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
It had that look -- but it was much different. The Catch came on a designed 
play, with Clark lined up at right end. The Montana-Jones pass came on a broken 
play. 
</P>
<P>
When the ball is in Montana's hands these days, the 49ers are so smooth that 
everything they do seems to have been rehearsed all year. As it usually has. 
They practice broken patterns at greater length than some college teams 
practice passing. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are a more conventional big-play passing team than the 49ers, and 
their quarterback, Jim Everett, is a more assertive passer than Montana. Under 
pressure, he is more likely than Montana to throw the ball to receivers who may 
be faster than San Francisco's, Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Everett has demonstrated, in any case, that he belongs on the same field with 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
One difference this season is that Everett's team has, on the whole, been more 
opportunistic. The Rams have suddenly taken charge of five or six games when 
all seemed lost. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, in last week's Ram game, the Giants began the first half with 
two field-goal drives, then began the second half with an 82-yard touchdown 
drive. That would have been good for a 13-0 lead -- possibly insurmountable -- 
if Giant Coach Bill Parcells hadn't blundered shortly before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Sensitive to criticism that he is too conservative, Parcells called for a pass 
at the Giant 20 -- with 34 seconds left -- instead of asking quarterback Phil 
Simms simply to kneel down. The Giants weren't going anywhere even if they had 
completed it. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams intercepted and scored on the next play when the Giant defense, which 
wanted only to throttle Parcells, couldn't get its heart into a rush on 
Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells' call will be rehashed interminably in New York, taking its place with 
the Joe Pisarcik play a dozen years ago. That time, instead of asking 
quarterback Pisarcik to kneel down with the ball as time ran out, the Giants 
ran it, fumbled and lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants are a kneeling-down team, not a passing team. When you forget who 
you are, the Anaheim opportunists are going to make you pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
In Denver Sunday, the Cleveland Browns will be the sentimental favorite of 
those who don't want to see the Broncos in the Super Bowl again. When they were 
there in '87 and '88, they were blown out by 19 and 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns, what's more, have a chance, having come together in recent weeks. 
The return of running back Kevin Mack balances an offense that has all the 
passes -- in and out, short and long -- now that quarterback Bernie Kosar's 
elbow merely hurts without hampering him. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland defense is aging but still a force with, among others, linebacker 
Clay Matthews and defensive end Carl Hairston. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews remains the best fundamental linebacker in the league. Watching 
Matthews is like watching a clinic on playing linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
But if Bronco quarterback John Elway finally has a handle on his team's new 
offense, as it seemed last week when he passed as well as rookie Bobby Humphrey 
ran, it will be a Denver day. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for Cleveland, as it was for Pittsburgh last week, is that there is 
too little oxygen in Mile High Stadium and too much noise. 
</P>
<P>
In backing away from its noise-abatement program this season, the NFL has taken 
a strong stand in favor of unsportsmanlike conduct.

ROBINSON CLEARS THE AIR ABOUT HIS RUSHING-HAPPY IMAGE; 
</P>
<P>
ANALYSIS: COACH SAYS HIS TEAMS WOULD HAVE BEEN THROWING YEARS AGO IF HE HAD HAD 
A QUARTERBACK LIKE EVERETT. 
</P>

<P>
The last time John Robinson had a Ram team in the NFC championship game, his 
offense didn't have a name, it had a number. Twenty-nine. Eric Dickerson right, 
Eric Dickerson left, Eric Dickerson until hell or Chicago freezes over, 
whichever happens last. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams lost that 1985 title game to the Bears, 24-0, but worse than that, 
they lost their grip on the NFC West. Whereas the Rams continued to wallow in 
the mud on third and six, their rivals from San Francisco chose to soar, if not 
with Eagles, then with Dolphins, Broncos and other post-modern types who saw 
air travel as the way of the future. 
</P>
<P>
So the 49ers passed and passed and passed the Rams in the standings. San 
Francisco's 1986 division championship was the first of four straight, a streak 
that continues still, and after a while, even the Rams had to notice. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Rams own a virtual clone of the San Francisco system. Jim Everett is 
their Joe Montana, Flipper Anderson their Jerry Rice, Henry Ellard their John 
Taylor. Right now, after 18 games, they're closing in on 5,000 yards passing 
and, as a result, closing in on the 49ers, whom they will play Sunday for the 
right to move on to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Still, old impressions die hard and the lasting perception of Robinson is of 
the USC coach who once sent Ricky Bell through the Washington State line 51 
times in a single game. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is the man who loved tailbacks, who accompanied Dickerson on his 
2,105-yard odyssey in 1984, who kept Charles White around like a tattered photo 
of an old girlfriend. The Rams have had Everett for 3 1/2 seasons, but the 
national view of Robinson as Mr. Off-Tackle persists. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, at his weekly press luncheon, Robinson was asked if he was finally at 
ease with Ernie Zampese's pass-first offensive program. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson jumped on the question as if it were a plant from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"At ease? I guess that infers that at some point, I wasn't at ease with it," 
Robinson began. "I think the perception that I would sooner run than pass has 
always been a misperception. I think that's always been wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"In the days when we were sitting here and talking about it, I would say it was 
wrong and you all thought I was a dumb . . . and I was lying to you. But I 
wasn't. I just didn't have a good quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"(Including) the days at USC, I've coached 14 years now and this is only the 
second time I've had the same quarterback for more than one year. The years at 
USC, I only had a quarterback for two years one time -- and that was Paul 
McDonald. He was All-American, All-Pac-10, the highest-rated passer in the 
nation. We passed a lot and we were really good at it. We had a big-time 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
"One year, I had Vince Evans, who was the MVP of the Pac-10, and we passed 
then, too. The years when I haven't had a good quarterback, I don't pass. I go 
to the run. And I've had a lot of those years." 
</P>
<P>
OK, let's break out the rosters. 
</P>
<P>
At USC, Robinson's starting quarterbacks were Evans in 1976, Rob Hertel in '77, 
McDonald in 1978-79, Gordon Adams in '80, John Mazur in '81, and Sean Salisbury 
in '82, until he got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
With the Rams, Robinson's regular quarterbacks, pre-Everett, were Vince 
Ferragamo in 1983, Jeff Kemp in '84, Dieter Brock in '85, and Steve Bartkowski 
and Steve Dils in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
OK, the coach has a point. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times when I was defending the quarterbacks that we had and the 
system we ran (because) I was scared to death about our passing game," Robinson 
said. "I had to fight to keep the run going because the pass-type offense 
seemed so seductive. Outstanding. Like San Diego and how fabulous that offense 
was." 
</P>
<P>
It was envy from afar, Robinson insists. While the San Diego attack was being 
charged by Dan Fouts, Robinson had Dieter Brock flinging wild pitches all over 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Given the choice, Robinson asks, wouldn't you give the ball to Dickerson? 
</P>
<P>
But now, the age of Zampese and Everett is upon us. Robinson finally has a real 
quarterback and, believe it or not, says he's getting a real thrill out of it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very persuasive in getting anybody to believe me, but I've been 
comfortable with this offense from the day we started," Robinson said. "There 
is no kind of rivalry between Ernie and me. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember reading somewhere, 'What are they going to -- Ernie's offense or 
Robinson's offense?' That was ridiculous at that time -- and it still is. 
</P>
<P>
"I fight hard on the practice field to make sure the run works and Ernie has 
the responsibility to make the pass successful. . . . I think the cooperation 
over what we're trying to do with our offense has been fabulous." 
</P>
<P>
It is a peaceful coexistence and, simply, something that had to be done. 
Keeping up with the Montanas requires a strong arm and an open mind. 
</P>
<P>
As long as there's a Super Bowl, and 49ers in the running for it, the forward 
pass is the only way to fly.

NCAA CONVENTION; 
</P>
<P>
DELEGATES SAY: SHORTEN BASKETBALL SEASON, GIVE RECRUITS GRAD RATES

The National Collegiate Athletic Assn. adopted measures designed to lessen the 
demands on athletes' time Tuesday, after an afternoon of politicking by the 
organization's Presidents Commission kept the measures from being shot down for 
at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
In the second voting session of the NCAA's annual convention, delegates 
approved shortening the basketball season by three games, delaying the start of 
basketball practice and the season, and limiting time and contact allowed for 
spring football drills. Also approved was a measure that will require public 
disclosure of schools' graduation rates. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps even more significantly, the Presidents Commission, which proposed all 
of these measures, was able to impose its will on a convention that seemed 
ready to knock down much of what the commission was proposing. 
</P>
<P>
The graduation-rate issue, the first item considered, was approved with little 
debate. But the time-reduction proposals appeared to be on the way out -- at 
least for another year -- until the commission, through some serious lobbying, 
hammered them into the rulebook. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative victory allowed the Presidents Commission to reclaim clout it 
seemed to have lost after cost-reduction proposals it sponsored were pushed 
aside at a special convention in Dallas in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"We got done what we wanted to get done," said UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, a 
member of the commission. "On several occasions where we appeared defeated, we 
kept slugging and came out the winner." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the passage of the time-reduction measures, known 
collectively as Proposition 30, left many athletic directors wringing their 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
"(Prop.) 30 is absurd," Miami Athletic Director Sam Jankovich said. "I'm really 
disappointed. The only thing it does is take away three games in basketball. 
That's not the real issue. As far as I'm concerned, we made a decision without 
real substance. The No. 1 issue is the number of hours spent on sports, not the 
number of games or reducing spring practice." 
</P>
<P>
Under Prop. 30, Division I basketball programs, previously restricted to 28 
regular-season games, will, starting in 1992-93, be allowed to play only 25 
games. That would include a postseason conference tournament, which counts as 
one game. Through an amendment, teams will be able to play in one of a variety 
of exempted games and tournaments, including the preseason NIT, Tip-off game 
and games in Hawaii and Alaska, every four years without those games counting 
against the 25. 
</P>
<P>
Also in 1992-93, the start of preseason basketball practice will be moved back 
to Nov. 1 from Oct. 15 and the start of the basketball season to Dec. 1 from 
the fourth Friday in November. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Division I-A and Division I-AA schools approved a plan in which, 
effective in the spring of 1991, football spring practice sessions will be 
reduced from 20 to 15 over 21 consecutive days, with contact allowed in only 10 
sessions. The Presidents Commission's original proposal would have limited 
spring practice to 10 sessions over 18 days and prohibited all contact. 
</P>
<P>
The convention also adopted a measure that calls for legislation reducing time 
demands on athletes in other sports, to be formulated by the NCAA Council this 
year and placed before the delegates in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The NCAA adopted the graduation-rate disclosure proposal as Congress is 
considering legislation to force the NCAA to take such action. 
</P>
<P>
Under the rule, the NCAA will be required to disclose data annually on a 
school-by-school basis, and schools will be required to provide the data to 
prospects and their parents during recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
The information will include average graduation rate for recruited athletes, 
given five years to graduate, in each sport for a school's four most recent 
graduating classes. The information will be broken down by race in football and 
men's and women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
A school's report also must include average high school grade-point average and 
standardized test scores for entering freshmen, and the percentage of those 
athletes admitted under provisions that differ from the school's usual 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
The Presidents Commission based its specific points in Prop. 30 on a report 
conducted for the commission by the American Institute for Research, which 
found that the time demands on athletes participating in football and baseball 
exceeded the time those athletes spent preparing for and attending class. 
</P>
<P>
An amendment that called for time-reduction study and legislation for all 
sports in 1991, not just those other than football and basketball, was defeated 
by the full membership early in Tuesday's session, indicating that the 
delegates were prepared to buy Prop. 30 as it was presented by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
But when delegates returned from their lunch break to consider specific cuts 
for football and basketball proposed by the commission, the mood of the session 
shifted. Debate over shortening the basketball season resulted in a 170-150 
vote by Division I schools in favor of referring the issue to the NCAA Council 
to consider this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We come down to the practical matter of funding our program," Brad Hovious, 
athletic director at Texas El Paso, told the convention. "Most of these (the 
three games to be eliminated) are home games for us. We're looking at big 
dollars sorely needed by a program, and I'm sure others feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Prop. 30 -- and, by extension, the Presidents Commission -- was in trouble. 
Suddenly under the gun, members of the commission began to work the floor, 
where they found that, in some cases, votes had gone against the commission 
mainly because schools' presidents had either left the convention early or 
failed to show at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us examined the (voting) roll and found some schools voting to refer 
when we knew their presidents did not support that," Young said, "and some of 
those (schools) agreed to change their votes." 
</P>
<P>
Said an angry Jankovich, the Miami athletic director, later: "A lot of 
arm-twisting took place. This was a session of total chaos." 
</P>
<P>
The presidents' lobbying brought another vote on the basketball season back to 
the convention floor, where this time it was approved by a vote of 206-116. 
</P>
<P>
Once that issue was settled, other parts of Prop. 30 fell into line for the 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Bradley, one of the sponsors of the bill before Congress that would 
require colleges to disclose graduation rates, said he was pleased with the 
NCAA's passage of a similar measure yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
"The NCAA Division I and Division II schools were nearly unanimous in their 
support of requirements to release graduation rates to future student-athletes 
and families," Bradley said in a statement. "This is fully consistent with the 
legislation that we have sponsored. . . . A potential student-athlete and his 
or her parents are entitled to a direct and valid answer to the question, 'If I 
enter your college or university . . . what are the chances that I will 
graduate within a year of those in my entering class?' " 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said he plans to pursue his legislation so NAIA schools, which are not 
governed by NCAA rules, will also be required to disclose graduation rates . . 
.

Villanova distance runner Vicki Huber last night was awarded the 
Honda-Broderick Cup, given annually to the nation's top collegiate female 
athlete. Huber, the NCAA indoor and outdoor 3,000 meters champion, received the 
award at a dinner held in conjunction with the NCAA convention. Among nine 
other candidates was UCLA softball player Janice Parks.

ALBACORE STILL REMAIN IN SOUTHLAND, BUT NOT ALWAYS EASY TO LOCATE

<P>
It may be winter, but that's not keeping albacore out of Southland waters. 
</P>
<P>
Commercial fishing boats have been hauling in impressive catches of the popular 
tuna off the east end of Santa Rosa Island, prompting some interest in the 
sportfishing community, which usually waits eagerly for the fish's showing off 
Baja California in the early summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Outer Limits, a sportfisher out of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing, made an 
exploratory trip to the island last weekend but returned without any albacore. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind kicked up, and we really didn't get to look around as much as we 
would have liked," said Gary Norby, the boat's skipper. "There were a lot of 
birds and bait, and we had meter readings -- everything looked like it was 
right, but for some reason we never did get any bites." 
</P>
<P>
R. Michael Laurs, an oceanographer with the National Marine Fisheries Service 
who specializes in migratory species, said the larger albacore, particularly 
this late in the season, tend to remain in deeper water, and because they are 
visual feeders they might not see a trolled lure or fly-lined anchovy. 
</P>
<P>
Last January, commercial fishermen netted more than 700 bluefin tuna, between 
six and nine feet long and weighing between 300 and 1,009 pounds, in the same 
area. Laurs couldn't explain what attraction those waters might hold for tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Norby said he couldn't be certain if the fish he metered were indeed albacore. 
But apparently the longfins are somewhere off the island's east end. In recent 
weeks, commercial fishermen have reported netting eight tons of albacore, all 
in the 60-pound range -- catches Laurs called unusual but not rare. 
</P>
<P>
"Oftentimes when fish are really late in migrating into the coast (as they were 
this summer), you see particularly larger fish late in the season," he said. 
"And the drift-net boats, when they were operating down here more, used to 
catch very large fish, sometimes into early January." 
</P>
<P>
Large albacore have cooperated with recreational fishermen late in the season 
before. In November 1984, the powerful tuna showed up between the mainland and 
Santa Catalina Island, and several were caught. Three of those fish, all 
weighing more than 70 pounds, are current line-class world records. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, the idea (behind such wintertime runs) is that almost every fish 
you might catch, depending on what size line you are using, could be a possible 
world-record fish," Norby said. "And that kind of excites a lot of people." 
</P>

Meanwhile, there have been reports of a few albacore in the 12-pound class 
taken 72 miles south of Point Loma, including one Saturday by the Prowler, out 
of Fisherman's Landing in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Laurs said there is strong evidence that some albacore winter in the Guadalupe 
Island area -- about 200 miles south of San Diego -- to spawn, so such 
insignificant catches are not considered unusual.

The 7 1/2-square-mile San Jacinto Wildlife Area east of Lake Perris will start 
receiving reclaimed water from Riverside County's Eastern Municipal Water 
District today. The water is being piped 10 miles from a sewage treatment plant 
in San Jacinto. The $5.3-million project, which involves the cooperation of the 
EMWD, the Department of Fish and Game and the Wildlife Conservation Board, will 
enhance ponds for waterfowl and irrigate wildlife habitat.

Several streams in Sonoma, Mendocino, Napa and Marin counties have been closed 
by the Department of Fish and Game to winter fishing, on a week-to-week basis, 
because of low river flows. The closures -- intended to protect spawning coho 
salmon and steelhead trout -- include the Gualala River in Sonoma County, 
Lagunitas and Walker creeks in Marin County, the Little and Big rivers in 
Mendocino County, and the Napa River from Napa to Calistoga.

CASTAIC LAKE ANGLERS GET TROPHY-SIZE LARGEMOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unseasonably strong largemouth bass bite continues at Castaic Lake, where 
fishermen have come from throughout the Southland to try for a trophy-sized 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
David Hepburn drove to the Los Angeles County reservoir from Whittier and 
caught a 14 1/4-pound largemouth. Chip Vannoy came from Moorpark and landed a 
13-pound 5-ounce bass. Troy Folkestad's trip from Huntington Beach paid off in 
a 12-pound 10-ounce fish. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Fishing is slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE HAVASU -- Striped bass are still at 40 feet, most in the four-pound range. 
Live shad, frozen anchovies and silver spoons are working best. Largemouth bass 
are biting on plastic worms from 15 to 30 feet. Catfish are slow. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Stripers are still active on the lake. Lawrence Cocad, 
Bullhead City, caught 18- and 12-pound stripers. Trolled lures are working 
best. Several limits of planted trout are coming from the river. Catfish are 
biting mainly at Topak Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
SALTON SEA -- Orangemouth corvina are picking up at Corvine Beach and Salt 
Creek. Trolling Thin Fin or Lunker lures are the best bet. Fish are averaging 
eight pounds. Sargo are active off North Shore jetty. Croaker action is best at 
Bombay Beach and Niland Marina. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Trout were planted twice last week and are biting on most baits 
near the launch ramp. Trollers are doing best using three-four colors and 
needlefish lure near dam or north shore. Largemouth bass are at 12 feet off 
rocky points and bay entrances. Catfish are slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Trout favoring nightcrawlers are biting primarily on west and 
east sides of the island. Largemouth bass averaging two pounds are biting best 
on crank baits at the northwest side of the island. Catfish are at 30 feet, and 
are most active off Arrow Island. Leonard Gibson, Oak View, caught a 15-pound 
catfish. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Striped bass are most active in the marina, biting best on 
Pencil Popper lures. Paul Selkirk, Frazier Park, caught and released 25- and 
10-pound stripers. Largemouth bass are biting fair in marina and Yellow Bar 
Cove. Randy Crabtree, Bakersfield, had two bass, six pounds, caught on purple 
plastic worms. Pat Whitdy, Tehachapi, caught three bass, 5 1/2 pounds, on 
nightcrawlers. Catfish are biting primarily at Glory Hole and Priest coves. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- Trout are the main attraction. Power Bait is producing the best 
results. The dam and San Felicia Cove are the best areas. Largemouth bass are 
picking up, biting at the north end. Steve Tsujiuchi, Torrance, caught and 
released a 9-pound bass. Steve Schoemann, Thousand Oaks, caught an 8-pound 
bass. Catfish are slow. 
</P>
<P>
CASTAIC LAKE -- Largemouth bass are providing the most action, biting in both 
lakes. Sam Amormino, Los Angeles, caught a 9-pound bass; Mike Hagerty, 
Sepulveda, a 10-pound bass that he released. Crappie are biting in upper lake 
on mini-jigs. Trout were stocked Tuesday and are biting best on Power Bait. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Trout fishing is steady and best in Sierra Cove and West Shore. 
Fernando Gutierrez, San Dimas, caught a 9 3/4-pound trout. Ed Otte, Norwalk, an 
8 1/2-pound trout. Derek Smith, Costa Mesa, a 7 1/4-pounder. Jim Sakaida, El 
Toro, a 4 1/4-pound trout. Other species are slow. 
</P>
<P>
PERRIS LAKE -- Fishing is slow overall. Best bet: largemouth bass at east end. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE SILVERWOOD -- Largemouth bass are providing the most action, averaging 
three-four pounds and biting off rocky points on spinner baits and plastic 
worms. Ralph Sierra, Fontana, had an eight-pound bass. Striped bass are fair, 
biting at 60 feet near the dam. Crappie are active at the outhouse cove, biting 
best on yellow and white mini-jigs.

OUTDOORS: LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION OFFERS GUIDELINES FOR THE '90S THAT INCLUDE 
SEEKING MORE INPUT FROM PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
California Fish and Game -- the commission and the department -- took some 
lumps when the Little Hoover Commission released the findings and 
recommendations of its 10-month study last week. 
</P>
<P>
The state's fish and wildlife program came off like a mom-and-pop store. 
According to the report, Mom, the Fish and Game Commission, lacks the 
scientific background to set proper policy. And Pop, the Department of Fish and 
Game professionals who administer the policy set by the commission, lacks the 
coordination to manage the state's natural resources into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
The report also lays blame at the feet of Gov. George Deukmejian, who appoints 
the five commissioners and "has publicly stated . . . that ranchers and 
sportsmen . . . represent the best possible membership." 
</P>
<P>
The Little Hoover Commission, which monitors and investigates efficiency of 
government agencies, says that biologists, environmentalists and developers 
might be helpful, as well, in planning the future of the resources. 
</P>
<P>
Some department employees couldn't agree more with the report. They are 
biologists and game wardens, frustrated not at being underpaid -- which they 
are -- but because of a lack of support from their Sacramento headquarters, 
where, they are convinced, policy is based primarily on politics. 
</P>
<P>
They see pleas for part-time help on special projects go unanswered, 
conscientious reports shelved. And, the Little Hoover report says, field 
employees complaining to Sacramento may get in trouble with regional 
administrators, who make up their own rules. 
</P>
<P>
It was noted that a court threw out a proposed bear hunt last year because the 
DFG lacked sufficient data to prove that such a hunt was viable, and that "the 
Legislature distinctly indicated its reluctance to discuss allocation of state 
resources until such time as the DFG can provide accounting information 
consistent with professional practice." 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature must approve the DFG's budget each year. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the report addressed public relations, in which, it said, "the DFG has 
demonstrated less than optimum performance." 
</P>
<P>
The most recent example: The Hoover report was released last Thursday. Hoover 
staff member Kathy Johnson said two copies were delivered to the DFG office on 
Wednesday "because we knew the media was going to call them and ask for a 
response." 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Game Commission office received copies Friday and, Johnson said, 
also could have had them earlier if requested, "but nobody asked." The report 
was straightforward and only 40 pages. It didn't require a lot of study. 
</P>
<P>
But despite requests for a response starting Thursday, DFG Director Pete 
Bontadelli didn't respond until Tuesday, when he issued a one-page, 
single-spaced statement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department is always looking for recommendations on how to improve our 
activities (and) will be striving to implement them," Bontadelli said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission still hasn't been heard from. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Hoover Commission report is meant as a guideline for the decade, but 
some DFG administrators already had a course set. In fairness to Bontadelli, he 
has been the director only since November of 1987 and has overseen several 
progressive changes. 
</P>
<P>
Trout fishermen will start the decade with a new statewide limit of five, down 
from 10 in the Eastern Sierra and northern regions. That proposal, adopted by 
the commission last month, received remarkably little objection. A 
conservation-minded public apparently was ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, because of an expanding demands on recreation resources, the state may 
soon need to buy fish from private hatcheries to supplement its own breeding 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't just cut the bag level to five," said Bob Rawstron, chief of the 
DFG's Inland Fisheries Division. "We are also increasing the average size of 
the fish we rear in the hatcheries. Where a catchable trout was four to six to 
the pound -- a seven- to nine-inch fish -- we're now looking at two to the 
pound, which is in the 11- or 12-inch range . . . (and) we can crowd only so 
many fish in until we start losing the advantages of growth." 
</P>
<P>
The DFG wouldn't need to plant as many if more anglers adopted the 
catch-and-release ethic, which Rawstron said is catching on. 
</P>
<P>
"You just don't see people coming off the lakes with big stringers anymore," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The issues of the '90s are more complex for hunting. After losing the bear 
hunt, the department won approval for a tule elk hunt only by researching a 
special report. This year the DFG is submitting environmental documentation to 
support hunts for deer, bear, elk, antelope, mountain lion and bighorn sheep. 
The deer paper alone is 300 pages. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Mansfield, assistant chief of the Wildlife Management Division, said: 
"The courts are interpreting laws differently. We're faced with the challenge 
of adapting to that. Having a hunting regulation treated as a project under the 
California Environmental Quality Act is a new twist. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a well-established animal-rights segment of the public that's to be 
reckoned with. We have to recognize their point of view and allow their input 
into the system. I hope we could identify objectivity versus emotional, 
philosophical attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to do a better job of educating . . . not the anti-hunting segment 
(nor) the current hunters, (but) that non-hunting segment in the middle that is 
a large portion of the California populace. They don't necessarily oppose 
hunting. But they're not always aware of the background behind . . . what the 
role of sport hunting is in longtime wildlife and habitat protection. (We need 
to) convey the idea that it's OK to sport-hunt (because) it doesn't take away 
opportunities from the non-hunting segment (to appreciate wildlife)." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps more than the public, Fish and Game needs to be enlightened, as the 
Hoover report stressed. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest concern to saltwater sport anglers is gill nets, which may lead to 
a ballot initiative in November. Critics say the DFG, under strong political 
pressure, has sold out to commercial interests. 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli says nobody knows how great an impact gill nets have on sport 
fisheries, and that may be the problem. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Helvey, coordinator of recreational fisheries for the National Marine 
Fisheries Service on Terminal Island, said: 
</P>
<P>
"Gill nets look like the destruction of the ocean, but we don't know if the 
information we get is accurate. Fish and Game says it's not as bad as others 
make it sound. And yet the data shows that they're a very effective fishing 
tool. You don't know whom to believe. What is going on out there? 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to (some) people in Fish and Game who say they've seen areas just 
totally wiped out. I personally think they have a pretty strong impact." 
</P>
<P>
Even if an initiative posed by Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) is 
successful, Helvey isn't sure it will help. The state's jurisdiction extends 
only to the three-mile limit. Beyond that are federal and international waters. 
</P>
<P>
"It just shifts the problem from one agency to another," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Helvey's organization has a goal that may work better. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting a conservation-education program, working with the resource 
agencies and the fishing industry. It's going to be directed at recreational 
fishermen (to) become more conscious of what they're doing out there . . . take 
only what they need, teach 'em proper techniques for catch-and-release and 
tag-and-release. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll point the finger at the commercial industry. And yet our recreational 
data base that monitors recreational fishermen shows that there's quite a bit 
of impact from recreational fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was real young, we used to go surf fishing and leave everything on the 
beach -- sharks and rays -- and not think anything of it. I think all of that 
has had an impact. I'm hoping the '90s will get people to learn the facts, 
rather than trying to gang up in an us-versus-them situation. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have seen the last couple of years is the recreational community 
becoming more organized . . . and gill nets have been the one rallying issue 
that has pulled them together. I see that as being a very effective force in 
getting our agency and Cal Fish and Game to sit up and pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the Little Hoover Commission got Fish and Game's attention.

<P>
Harry L. Usher, chairman of the U. S. Olympic Festival, announced preliminary 
plans Tuesday for the 1991 event, which will be held in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Usher said about 4,000 athletes will compete in 37 sports on July 12-21 in the 
U.S. Olympic Festival, formerly known as the National Sports Festival. 
</P>
<P>
As in the last Olympics held here, the athletes' quarters will be at USC and 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Venue sites are still tentative, according to Elizabeth M. Primrose, president 
of the 11th Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
L.A. was the host city for the 1932 and 1984 Olympic Games, and Usher said the 
city is aiming to lure the Olympics back in 2004.

ANGELS GET BAILES TO BOLSTER STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Angels, continuing to add veteran pitching depth apparently in an effort to 
enhance their ability to trade for a hitter, sent two farm prospects to the 
Cleveland Indians Tuesday for versatile Scott Bailes. 
</P>
<P>
Bailes, 28, a left-hander, was 5-9 with a 4.28 earned-run average in 11 starts 
and 23 relief appearances with the Indians last year. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 31-41 record in four seasons at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels gave up infielder Jeff Manto, 25, who hit 23 home runs and drove in 
67 runs in 127 games at Edmonton last season, and pitcher Colin Charland, 24, 
who was 5-10 at Edmonton after going 17-5 at Palm Springs in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said he thought that Manto and Charland both have 
major league potential but doubted either would be ready in 1990. Bailes, he 
said, represents immediate help as a starter or reliever and enhances a 
pitching surplus that might eventually help the club land a solid hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of Mark Langston gave the Angels six starting pitchers, the 
Angels have acquired Mike Smithson, Mark Eichhorn and Bailes, who join Bryan 
Harvey, Willie Fraser, Greg Minton, Bob McClure and Rich Monteleone in creating 
a bullpen logjam. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of good arms to choose from and a lot of good depth that might 
bring us back the offensive player we covet," Port said, adding that the 
surplus enables the Angels to investigate new trade possibilities, which he 
refused to identify. ROSS NEWHAN

PUBLISHERS IN A FRENZY OVER BOSTON DEATHS

<P>
Charles Stuart's body had not even been fished out of the Boston harbor on 
Thursday when Colleen Mohyde received her first call about a book on the 
murder-suicide case that has gripped this city and much of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I had hardly had time to get my coffee," the assistant editor at Little, Brown 
Co. said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Mohyde said, at least eight more literary agents and writers have 
contacted her about possible books on the stunning story of a pregnant woman 
shot and killed in inner-city Boston last October while driving home to the 
suburbs after a birthing class. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Charles Stuart, who was seriously wounded in the incident as well, 
at first told police that he and his wife had been shot by a black man who 
leaped into their car at an intersection and demanded their money and jewelry. 
But last Wednesday evening, Stuart's youngest brother Matthew came forth with 
information implicating Charles Stuart as his wife's murderer. Early the next 
day, before the morning rush-hour traffic had begun, Charles Stuart apparently 
parked his car on the Tobin Bridge and jumped to his death. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, with bizarre details continuing to tumble out, the city has talked 
of little other than the strange tale of the victim-turned-villain. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been living and breathing this case here," said Mohyde. She added that 
several editors at the New York office of her publishing house had received 
proposals for books on the Stuart case as well. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, it's a wonderful story, just a wonderful story," Jane Dystel, a 
literary agent in New York, said. "There are so many different elements to it." 
</P>
<P>
Dystel was so convinced of the marketability of the Stuart case that she pulled 
one of her client-writers, Joseph Sharkey, off another true-crime project and 
ordered him to take the first shuttle to Boston. Sharkey arrived here within 
three hours of Stuart's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure where the body was," Dystel said when asked if Sharkey had 
arrived in town before the body was pulled from the harbor. "But we were 
there." 
</P>
<P>
In New York, Henry Dunow, a literary agent with Curtis Brown Associates, said 
that when he first read of the case in the Friday morning newspaper, he saw 
quick parallels to such true-crime bestsellers as Joe McGinniss' "Fatal 
Vision," and "Small Sacrifices," by Ann Rule. Dunow immediately picked up the 
phone and called Constance L. Hays, a reporter in the New York Times' Boston 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Dunow said he recognized the complex story instantly as "obviously, a very 
fertile subject for a book." There was racism, violence, a personality who 
would apparently "walk out of a birthing class and shoot his wife" as well as 
the fact that so many people so willingly swallowed the story of Stuart, who 
first telegraphed the tale when he called state police for help on his car 
telephone, Dunow said. 
</P>
<P>
His call to Hays came, by her recollection, before coroners had completed the 
autopsy on Stuart. Hays, covering the story for her daily newspaper beat, told 
Dunow she was too busy to think about his proposal or any of the other seven 
inquiries she received from agents and publishers within days of Stuart's 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
"But my husband, ever practical, said I should find out how much the advance 
should be," Hays said. 
</P>
<P>
At the city's two daily newspapers, the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald, 
reporters on the Stuart case said that they, too, had been besieged by calls 
from publishers and agents seeking to interest them in Stuart book projects. On 
Tuesday, one Globe writer was said to be in New York, negotiating a contract 
for a book on the story. 
</P>
<P>
But while "it's tempting, very tempting, to think that in three months you 
could make a lot of money slapping something out very quickly on a story that 
already has a lot of information out about it," Globe reporter Matthew Brelis 
said he had heard colleagues echo his own view that for journalists, there is 
sometimes a fine line between exploiting a story and covering it. Brelis said 
that at least 10 Globe reporters, as well as several columnists, had been 
assigned to the Stuart story. 
</P>
<P>
Brelis said he got a call from Dell about doing a book. But like Hays of the 
New York Times, "I said, look, I'm just too busy to think about it," Brelis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even in publishing -- a field quick to recognize a commercial topic -- the 
flurry of interest in this case of true crime and a seemingly happy, upwardly 
mobile suburban young couple appeared to set new records, James Frost, the 
editor in chief at Warner Books in New York, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like this," Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw a lot (of interest) for the Lisa Steinberg case," involving child abuse 
in New York City, Frost said. "And if the Green River suspect" -- referring to 
a string of murders near Seattle -- "had actually been the man who had 
committed the murders, you would have seen a similar response. A good mass 
murderer with the psychological underpinnings is always a good subject." 
</P>
<P>
Frost said the number of inquiries he had received suggested that "every major 
agent in town has someone wanting to write this book." 
</P>
<P>
Frost said he expected that "publishers will probably shy away from" the racial 
angles of this story. Instead, "we see it as personality-driven. Everyone wants 
to know what makes Charles Stuart tick." 
</P>
<P>
While conceding that the field was something of a derby at the moment, Frost 
predicted that the market could sustain "two, maybe three books, tops" on the 
case. However, said Frost, "I don't think you're going to see that few." 
</P>
<P>
John Sterling, editor in chief of the adult trade division at Houghton Mifflin, 
a publishing house based jointly in Boston and New York, said he had several 
Stuart proposals on his desk, and that he had spoken to at least half a dozen 
agents about Stuart book projects. He said he knew of "seven or eight" other 
proposals circulating within his publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
"But I am not terribly interested, I confess, in the numbers," Sterling said. 
"What is clear is that people are going crazy on this." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the explanation for the feeding frenzy, Sterling said, was "a very 
quiet fall (autumn) on the acquisition front. 
</P>
<P>
"Frenzies tend to happen when people get hungry," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
But to Sterling, what makes the story so fascinating is the surprise element of 
Stuart's apparent involvement in his pregnant wife's death. 
</P>
<P>
"Who could imagine?" Sterling asked. "Who could imagine that this man would 
shoot his pregnant wife?" That kind of "whiplash" effect, he continued, "is 
like suddenly feeling the ground beneath you shift. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly," Sterling said, "you have this amazing lightning rod." 
</P>
<P>
At Little, Brown, Colleen Mohyde took much the same position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a question of trust, the public trust," she said. "You don't want to be 
cynical. You want to believe that victims really are victims. We all sort of 
become victims otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
Some publishers predicted that big advances might be forthcoming as a result of 
competition over Stuart books. But as James Frost at Warner Books noted, "the 
big unknown is that we haven't heard from the heavyweights yet" -- writers, 
said Frost, such as Joe McGinniss, Ann Rule and Norman Mailer. "They're still 
out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, interest continues at a feverish pitch. Mohyde, for one, said she had 
heard the Stuart tale likened to "a nonfiction 'Bonfire of the Vanities,' " or 
to "An American Tragedy," by Theodore Dreiser. 
</P>
<P>
"There's definitely a book there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And apparently a movie as well. Ron Howard, the Hollywood producer, was 
reported to have made extensive inquiries about securing rights to the story. 
And Hays, at the New York Times, said she had been unsure what to respond when 
a producer called demanding to know who owned the rights to the Stuart case.

WRITERS' ROW HOMELESS, BUT NEVER FAR FROM THE MUSE, A COALITION OF SCRIBES IS 
STRIVING TO BRIDGE A YAWNING SOCIAL CHASM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Under the fierce fluorescence of a winter morning's sun, a ragged knot of 
homeless people rest against a Skid Row wall. Around them are bundles and 
grocery carts, and, in their midst, a figure sits in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
From down the street a police car swings up, leveling a microphone blast at the 
motley bunch. 
</P>
<P>
"You're gonna get in front of the mission or get off the streets!" a woman's 
voice shrills. 
</P>
<P>
A group on the opposite curb merely shrug. They are homeless writers and this 
is part of their daily existence -- the stuff they use to stir their muses. 
</P>
<P>
From a wellspring of bitterness and love, they write of drugs and crime, of God 
and their mothers, of standing in a line waiting for food, living in cardboard, 
keeping on the move with no place to rest. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Skid Row poets and writers have formed the Homeless Writers 
Coalition. Their goal is to rent a neighborhood storefront office where they 
can write and keep their manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
More transcendently, they want to bridge the gap between homeless people and 
the society to which some aspire to belong. Their message, told over and over 
in their work, is that they are no different from anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
For those who would listen, they voice possible solutions to their plight. For 
one who wants to look behind their verses, they offer an informal odyssey 
through their lives on "The Row." 
</P>
<P>
In a booth at nearby Gorky's Cafe, a slender man of 42 spreads the counter with 
papers. He reads from some of them in the mellifluous voice that recalls his 
Louisiana upbringing. Born Willy Lewis, he goes by the name Dino. He is a 
sometimes-homeless writer and driving force behind the Homeless Writers 
Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Once there was a good job, fine clothes and diamond rings 
</P>
<P>
 Houses in the hills, new cars and everything 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Now my good job is gone, my wife and kids I'll never find 
</P>
<P>
 And my life is spent looking for food, every day from line to line 
</P>
<P>
 My house is made of cardboard, now sitting on the curb 
</P>
<P>
 Where loneliness, destruction, and dope is the only word 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Now this story could go on, there is so much you need to know 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm not the one to tell you, how quickly the good things can go 
</P>
<P>
 In the quiet after the poem, Dino nods at a compliment and allows, "The only 
bad thing about it is you tell too much about yourself when you talk from the 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, poetry from the heart by the homeless is beginning to make its way 
from The Row into the mainstream in a rush of events. 
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of municipally and privately sponsored programs, homeless 
writers are reading for audiences ranging from the hungry in Skid Row soup 
lines to bookstore patrons in towns like Claremont and Santa Monica. The week 
of Feb. 11, homeless writers will read with established authors at Los 
Angeles-area bookshops to benefit the national homeless-advocacy group, Share 
Our Strength. Part of the revenues collected from those readings will go to the 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
Dino is mobilizing the grass-roots Los Angeles group Artists against 
Homelessness to sponsor another fund-raising event for his organization. He has 
also written a skit for a homeless event at the Afro-American Museum, and, 
along with another homeless writer who calls himself Southern Comfort, has his 
work printed in a booklet at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Dino pulls all of this material out of a brown vinyl briefcase that he carries 
wherever he goes. His companion, Jackie, totes an address book filled with the 
names of the people and agencies they hope will work with the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want handouts," Dino says. "Good jobs and affordable housing are what 
we need. 
</P>
<P>
"They say the only people on the streets are the ones who want to be there," he 
says, waving toward the wall of skyscrapers north of Broadway. "How can they 
say that when they live in their big $250,000 homes? They send you a food line 
and some used clothes." 
</P>
<P>
Dino is picking politely at the lettuce leaves of a salad he has finally 
consented to eat. 
</P>
<P>
"I only need two meals a day," he says, patting his flat belly. He and Jackie 
were up at 5:30 a.m. to line up for 8 a.m. breakfast at the Midnight Mission on 
Los Angeles Street. 
</P>
<P>
It is after noon now, and, after lunch, Dino and Jackie have places to go and 
people to organize. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to catch up with homeless people," Dino says with the kind of soft 
irony that defines the fragility of his position. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Dino and Jackie are waiting in front of what is grandly called 
</P>
<P>
the San Julian Hotel, a flophouse of about 20 rooms, one of which they have 
lived in for several months. 
</P>
<P>
The rent is $312, the equivalent of a month's general relief check. For this 
they are usually allowed no visitors, no cooking in the room, no telephone, no 
private bathroom. A sink gushes with a leak, a piece of sheet covers a small 
window that will not shut and a naked light bulb glimmers from the ceiling 
shadows. In preparation for a visitor, Jackie has dressed the bed in a bright 
flowered spread that speaks of a former suburban existence. 
</P>
<P>
Dino writes on a donated typewriter, set on a wood crate pulled up to the bed. 
A love poem to Jackie hangs on the wall: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Now there is two of us, sharing a life meant for one 
</P>
<P>
 Loving, caring, and sharing . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now my life is made easy . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the year that they have been together, Jackie and Dino have lived 
"in cardboard." 
</P>
<P>
"I refused to believe I was on the streets," says Jackie. "I pretended I was on 
a camping trip." 
</P>
<P>
Between 5 and 6 a.m., the police would rout them and the thousands of other 
homeless people off the sidewalks of Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jackie and I got serious we knew we had to do something better." 
</P>
<P>
For a while Dino took a job loading and unloading trucks in central downtown, 
earning black-market wages of $20 for six hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
He has also worked as a janitor ("I can mop and sweep with the best of them"), 
a doorman and a bartender in Las Vegas. He has been in and out of jail and has 
lost track of a wife and four children. When he took up with Jackie, he had 
just gotten out of prison, where he'd served two years for burglary. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see your children hungry and crying for food, a man will do a lot of 
strange things," he says. 
</P>
<P>
At the mention of her past, Jackie stiffens. She says her last name is Townsen, 
she is 50, from Sacramento, has seven children and is divorced. On The Row, she 
hands out blankets and clothes she collects from the missions and is known as 
"Mamma." 
</P>
<P>
Leaving their room, Jackie and Dino set to spread word of that evening's 
meeting of Artists against Homelessness, which will focus on fund raising for 
the Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The streets are filled with the background music of sirens and bordered by 
walls topped with barbed wire coils, but they are also filled with their 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
Dino raises his palm and crooks his fingers in a masculine handshake; Jackie 
dispenses hugs and kisses. 
</P>
<P>
Among the regulars: a "very special" police officer, who used to come beat on 
their box until the morning that Dino woke up and found Jackie reading him 
poetry written on the walls of their cardboard house; and "Tony I Am," the 
minister who's run a soup line on Skid Row for the past three years without 
missing a week. 
</P>
<P>
There are also the babblers and beggars. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, man, I'm a curb creature," Dino protests at an outstretched hand. And 
there are the truly downtrodden. By the doorway of her hotel, a woman suns 
herself on a newspaper mat. She clutches a handful of cigarettes, her wrist 
ringed with a bracelet tattoo, and stares into nowhere. Jackie bends down and 
pats her. 
</P>
<P>
"Her hotel makes ours look like the Bonaventure," she later says. "It's the 
roughest on The Row." 
</P>
<P>
But it is Southern Comfort (whose real name is Charles Walker) the pair is 
after. Dino has been "bounty hunting" for his peripatetic pal who lives in 
cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
They meet the 34-year-old poet by a wall where he has painted his poetry. A 
barren slab on 5th Street 10 months ago, the wall now blazes with his brightly 
colored verses, written in paint salvaged from trash heaps. 
</P>
<P>
"The plot of my rhymes is in the agonies and discomforts of my life and my 
friends' lives," he says over lunch at a local fast-food spot. 
</P>
<P>
 I hang in all the dope spots, not trying to cope, 
</P>
<P>
 just wishing in my heart that everyone would stop. 
</P>
<P>
 refilling their pipes with those little tiny beams 
</P>
<P>
 and ailing for real and busting at the seams . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort says he spent seven years in Germany and Holland, first as a 
cryptographer for the Army, then riding an old bike selling roses to 
shopkeepers and passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an able-bodied person. I can go out and get a job," he says with traces of 
a Texas drawl. "But I don't feel comfortable. It's like I got to be on quiet. I 
can't express how I really feel. Society that's here now is a real fabrication 
to me. It's not real at all." 
</P>
<P>
Dino says if people "would put the faith and the time into a person, they could 
probably find anybody they wanted on The Row to handle almost any job." 
</P>
<P>
Says Comfort: "Right, but see it's not the skills the people are lacking. 'You 
know, you don't look like the guy I want to sit behind my desk.' Like there's 
always been the outcasts of society." 
</P>
<P>
So Comfort remains in the rag camps. "We're like family," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Comfort finishes his beef teriyaki and promises to be at an afternoon rehearsal 
of a Maxim Gorky play, directed by Michael McGee, an actor from Artists against 
Homelessness. The play will be read and later, the organization hopes, produced 
at a series of Skid Row venues. As he leaves, Comfort says he will also be at 
the evening meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at the Midnight Mission, Russ Gardner, who mans the reception desk, also 
makes note of the evening meeting of Artists against Homelessness. Gardner, 61, 
a former occupational nurse, is a genial white-haired man who likes to joke, 
but his poetry is something quite different: 
</P>
<P>
 The streets are angry! 
</P>
<P>
 Listen! 
</P>
<P>
 To the roar of muted voices, the silent stamping of leaden 
</P>
<P>
 feet, speaking out in many languages of the same tongue, the frustrations of 
themselves, of others, the need to be free . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dino and Jackie continue their rounds. At the small park on San Julian Street, 
Dino finds Fred Burton, who tends the green oasis -- "a place for reflection," 
he says -- where men gather to play chess and dominoes and where Fred dreams up 
the verses he writes in a vintage Day-at-a-Glance journal. 
</P>
<P>
They also find Luanne Poindexter, a songwriter, and hear Alexander Anderson is 
back in town. A social worker they meet announces that a storefront for the 
coalition may be in the offing. She conjures images of sunshine and plants: "I 
want it to be pretty." Dino grins, thinking of cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, you women. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for McGee in front of the San Julian Hotel, Dino explains his ambitions 
for the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm trying to do is establish the coalition as an organization of its 
own. I don't want anyone to control it but the writers themselves. No one has 
the last word. We sit down and we talk about things and we vote." 
</P>
<P>
When McGee arrives, Dino and Jackie move to the rear of an adjacent parking 
lot. There they settle on a Victorian-red velveteen sofa, abandoned under the 
barbed wire coils on a battered brick wall. 
</P>
<P>
In his play "The Lower Depths," the Russian writer deals with people at the 
bottom of society. The actor has added a prologue from Gorky's political novel 
"The Mother." He hands Dino his part to read. 
</P>
<P>
"We are revolutionaries and we'll go on being revolutionaries as long as some 
people do nothing but give orders and others do nothing but work. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Comfort has not shown up, so the actor reads his lines. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the time will come when all people will wonder at their own beauty, 
when each will be like a star to all the others. The Earth will be peopled with 
free men, great in their freedom. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But Dino is thinking of Comfort; his buddy had better turn up for the evening's 
meeting. He reckons he'll have to go back out bounty hunting for him again.

<TEXT>
<P>
Oliver Rose knows how to retaliate. After his wife nearly kills him in the 
marital-discord film, "The War of the Roses," he saws off the heels of her many 
splendid shoes. 
</P>
<P>
On screen, wife Barbara Rose's vast collection, enshrined museum-like behind 
wall-to-wall glass doors, may look far-fetched. But the next time you exchange 
small talk with a well-heeled female, ask how many pairs of shoes she owns. 
</P>
<P>
The answer could knock your socks off. 
</P>
<P>
In New York and Los Angeles alone, there are women with collections ranging 
from 70 to 700 pairs. Right up there with them is Mary Trasko, ) author of the 
coffee-table tome, "Heavenly Soles," (published last fall by Abbeville Press), 
who keeps an adored Roger Vivier pump, given to her by the designer, in the 
china cabinet of her New York apartment. 
</P>
<P>
What leads seemingly rational (and not always rich) women to such extremes? By 
their own and expert accounts, they think of beautifully made shoes as art. 
Wearable sculpture. Poetry in motion. On a more down-to-earth level, they revel 
in the exquisite materials, the craftsmanship and the comfort they say can only 
be found in expensive footwear. 
</P>
<P>
Added to that is the ease. "Buying a pair of shoes is not like buying a pair of 
pants," notes one retailer. "There's far less ego involved. A woman doesn't 
have to get undressed." 
</P>
<P>
Trasko calls members of the haute shoe-buying clique "shoe collectors or shoe 
enthusiasts. I wouldn't say fetishists, because that's more of a sexual thing." 
</P>
<P>
Yet every enthusiast can name a designer who sends her into ecstasy. For 
Trasko, it's Vivier, the Frenchman who purportedly created the stiletto heel 
and made a silver pump with a "ball of diamonds" heel (out of rhinestones) for 
Marlene Dietrich. 
</P>
<P>
The savvy also rave about French-born Maud Frizon, known for her fanciful, 
flirtatious pumps; London-based Manolo Blahnik, a specialist in sexy evening 
mules; Italian Andrea Pfister, designer of the 1979 "bird cage" shoe that 
spawned millions of plastic imitations, known as "jellies"; Robert Clergerie 
and Stephane Kelian, French designers dedicated to simple, stylish footwear. 
</P>
<P>
They also treasure Parisian Philippe Model, whose capricious flair influences 
both his hats and shoes; fellow Parisian Christian Louboutin, who works in 
unusual materials, such as palm bark and fish skins; Walter Steiger, son of a 
Swiss shoemaker, who creates classic, architectural footwear in Italy; 
New-York-based Susan Bennis and Warren Edwards, designers of flights of fancy 
that are on display in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for fine footwear can range from about $200 to more than $1,000, 
although some lucky collectors have found vintage shoes in thrift shops for as 
little as $15. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Leeson, screenwriter and co-producer, says the idea of destroying shoes 
in "The War of the Roses" occurred to him during an argument with his wife. 
They were walking to their car, exchanging verbal blows, when she stopped 
mid-sentence to stare at a window filled with Walter Steiger footwear. 
</P>
<P>
Leeson demanded to know how shoes could be more important than the tiff at 
hand. His wife's only response was, " 'Shh,' " he recalls. "I was standing 
behind her and I thought of sawing the heels off her shoes. If I were going to 
do something really hurtful, it would be through her shoes, because women do 
have this unnatural attachment to their shoes. They are almost mystical in 
their importance." 
</P>
<P>
"I hate to say it, but if it's between the rent and a great pair of shoes, 
shoes win out. That's what some customers tell me," confides Teri Ragsdale, 
manager of the Maud Frizon boutique on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
A more affluent customer -- hooked on Frizon's handmade lasts (the inner 
structure of each shoe) and whimsical details -- once left with 12 pairs of the 
$300-and-up footwear. And a novice made off like a bandit the day her 
Frizon-loving mother let her sample the children's collection. 
</P>
<P>
"This little girl could barely talk. So when her mother asked her which shoe 
she wanted, the lavender or the black, she picked up one of each," recalls 
Ragsdale. The Beverly Hills moppet got a pair of each, at $250 a throw. 
</P>
<P>
Madeleine Gallay, owner of the Sunset Plaza boutique with the same name, says 
her grown-up customers wear Manolo Blahnik's mules ($330-$600) "with anything 
from blue jeans to ball gowns. Shoes and accessories are the most important 
things these women own. All a dress has to do is look good. But they have to 
love the shoes and accessories. I agree with them. These are the things that 
express who you are." 
</P>
<P>
At Ecru on Melrose Avenue, manager Elizabeth Kellin expresses appreciation for 
one customer, an artist, who is seriously considering decorating her living 
room with all the Robert Clergerie shoes she owns. 
</P>
<P>
In Kellin's own closet are "100 pairs of shoes, if not more." Depending upon 
past associations, some are her "happy shoes," others are "sexy shoes," still 
others are "power shoes," including one pair of low-heeled Clergerie oxfords 
that always bring her the job she wants. 
</P>
<P>
She professes to "love shoes more than jewelry, and I take exceptionally good 
care of them." 
</P>
<P>
She has them waterproofed, gets toe guards put on the tips of the soles and 
keeps her shoes in boxes inside cloth travel pouches "so they don't hit against 
each other." If they need a light cleaning and brushing, she does that. If more 
is required, she takes them to a place where she has seen miracles worked: the 
Shoe Doctor on West 3rd Street in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Tips from other footwear fanatics include: Stuff shoes with tissue or shoe 
trees. Keep them in original boxes (worth more to future collectors that way). 
Avoid the rain. Waterproof soles with mink oil or polish. Ride, don't walk, in 
very delicate shoes. 
</P>
<P>
One Los Angeles woman, who insists on anonymity, says she and her husband 
recently moved into a beautiful new home: "But the joke is, all I really wanted 
was a closet for my shoes. It would have been a lot less expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Now she keeps 70 pairs on specially designed shelves behind Plexiglas. Among 
her favorites are black suede Maud Frizon flats trimmed with silver bells, 
which she wears only in December "and never to the theater" (the noise, you 
know). She was so excited when she bought them in New York a few years ago, she 
telephoned her husband in Los Angeles with the news. 
</P>
<P>
Author Trasko can easily explain such behavior: "Shoes are more seductively 
sculptural than any other element of fashion." 
</P>
<P>
After she began collecting Viviers several years ago, Trasko gradually threw 
out all her other footwear (except some plastic rain boots) and became a 
different person: "I'm happy to say, it has changed my life just to wake up in 
the morning and put on a perfectly designed pair of shoes." 
</P>
<P>
"Because they complete the picture, shoes do present the possibility of 
perfection," concurs Stella Resnick, a Los Angeles psychologist and footwear 
collector. 
</P>
<P>
They also "confer power. Heels make you taller. Then there's all the emotional 
symbolism (such as) stomping your feet. Language really attaches a lot of 
powerful emotions to our feet. Shoes protect them and make them less 
vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
When Oliver Rose saws off those heels, "it's obviously a violent gesture. He 
paid for those shoes; he was taking them back in a sense," observes Resnick. 
</P>
<P>
Several scenes later, Barbara Rose gets revenge by destroying her husband's 
beloved Staffordshire china. But for shoe enthusiast Elizabeth Kellin that 
isn't good enough: "I would have blown him up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Emmel, director of communications for the National Shoe Retailers 
Assn., says the average woman in the United States owns 15 to 20 pairs of shoes 
and spends $50 for a pair of quality pumps.

'TEDDY Z' WILL GO ON HIATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CBS said Tuesday it will put "The Famous Teddy Z," its comedy send-up of a 
Hollywood talent agency, on hiatus until April, then will try to raise its 
ratings by scheduling it in a later time slot. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Jan. 29, its 8:30 p.m. Monday time slot will be taken over by "City," 
a comedy starring Valerie Harper as a city manager, widowed for seven years, 
living with her 19-year-old daughter, a college dropout (Luanne Ponce). The 
show, from MTM Enterprises, is produced by former "thirtysomething" producer 
Paul Haggis and Harper's husband, Tony Cacciotti. 
</P>
<P>
"Teddy Z" marks the third show to be removed from the CBS schedule since Jeff 
Sagansky took over Dec. 18 as president of the entertainment division. He 
previously canceled "Snoops" and "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
Although CBS had no comment on the sidelining of "Teddy Z," creator and 
executive producer Hugh Wilson ("Frank's Place," "WKRP in Cincinnati") said 
Tuesday that if the six remaining episodes fail to draw larger audiences in a 
later time slot, it will be canceled. No new episodes have been ordered. 
</P>
<P>
" 'WKRP' was taken off the air into one of those vague, indefinite hiatuses and 
returned, and survived," Wilson said. "I'm hopeful that history will repeat 
itself here." 
</P>
<P>
If the new time slot improves the show's performance and it is renewed in the 
fall, Wilson added, the show will undergo some creative changes before resuming 
production. He said that Sagansky had suggested creating new characters within 
the agency and exploring their lives in the tradition of "WKRP in Cincinnati" 
and other ensemble office comedies. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said Sagansky believes "Teddy Z's" current 8:30 time is more appropriate 
for family sitcoms than an office comedy. 
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "In April, we need to show some signs of vitality, or the 
re-tooling is a fairly moot point." 
</P>
<P>
"Teddy Z" ranks 55th out of 88 prime-time shows in the season-to-date Nielsen 
ratings, with an 11.5 rating and an 18% share of the available audience. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he was surprised and disappointed by "Teddy Z's" failure to win a 
larger audience, and added that the show, from Columbia Television, had tested 
well with audiences, particularly the characters of Teddy Zakolokis (Jon Cryer) 
and groveling super-agent Al Floss (Alex Rocco). 
</P>
<P>
He said the show has already begun to focus less on Teddy's home life, where he 
lives with his brother and his Old World Greek grandmother. But the producer 
doesn't intend to remove Teddy's family from the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it (the family) is not our trump suit, but it's necessary as a reminder 
of who Teddy is," Wilson said. "Also, I feel very obligated to the actors to 
make the damn thing work."

PALM SPRINGS INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL OPENS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Coast premieres of Denys Arcand's "Jesus of Montreal," Patrice 
Laconte's "Monsieur Hire," and Giuseppe Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso," three of 
the hits of last year's Cannes Film Festival, highlight the schedule of the 
inaugural Palm Springs International Film Festival, which begins tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, 46 films will be screened during the five-day event that Mayor 
Sonny Bono promised local merchants last spring would grow to rival the Cannes 
Film Festival, with film competition, markets and star tributes. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's first event is a modest beginning, with no world premieres, no film 
market and few stars scheduled to attend. But the event does boast a wide range 
of international pictures, including the opening night feature, "Cinema 
Paradiso," an Italian film about a young boy's fascination with movies shown in 
a village theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Cinema Paradiso" screens at 7 tonight at the Plaza Theater in Palm Springs. 
The Plaza is one of eight Palm Springs theaters turned over for festival 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other films scheduled are: "The Killer" (from Hong Kong), a gangster 
drama by John Wood; Percy Adlon's "Rosalie Goes Shopping" (West Germany), which 
is set in the rural American South; Coline Serrau's "Romuald et Juliette" 
(France); and David Lynch's "Twin Peaks" (United States) 
</P>
<P>
Several American comedy classics are being shown in separate tributes to Bob 
Hope, Kirk Douglas, Frank Capra and James Stewart, though none of the honorees 
were planning to attend, according to a festival spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to screenings, the American Film Institute is hosting a series of 
seminars on acting, directing and cinematography. Information: (800) 366-FILM.

NHL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
LAFLEUR STINGS THE CANADIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was literally adding insult to injury to the Montreal Canadiens Tuesday 
night at Quebec City, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Guy Lafleur, one of the greatest players in Montreal history, scored a goal for 
Montreal's bitter rival, the Nordiques, and led them to a 5-2 victory over the 
crippled Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
After 14 seasons in which he helped make the Canadiens the power of the NHL, 
Lafleur retired after the 1984 season. 
</P>
<P>
It was bad enough when he came out of retirement to play for the New York 
Rangers last year. But when he signed with Quebec last July, it was a bitter 
blow to Montreal fans. 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur scored the 546th goal of his career at 8:11 of the first period to give 
the Nordiques a 2-0 lead. It was his first goal against his old mates since 
joining the Nordiques. He scored 518 goals for Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens, who have struggled all season, at least partly because of an 
unusual rash of injuries, were without their best defenseman, Chris Chelios, 
and top playmaker Bobby Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Chelios, who didn't miss a game last season and won the Norris Trophy as the 
outstanding defenseman, missed his first game because of a groin injury. He is 
out indefinitely. Smith has a bruised shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens have already had more injury problems this season than all of 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 3, Calgary 2 -- After losing at home Sunday night to the Stanley Cup 
champion Flames, the Oilers went to overtime at Calgary to turn the tables. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Gelinas, who went to the Oilers in the trade that sent Wayne Gretzky to 
the Kings, scored at 2:11 of overtime to put the Oilers five points in front in 
the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 9, Minnesota 0 -- Shawn Burr had a hat trick, including two 
short-handed goals, and added two assists in the rout at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Six weeks ago, the North Stars were leading the Norris Division and were 18 
points ahead of the slumbering Wings. The Wings have won four of five and trail 
the slumping Stars by only seven points. 
</P>
<P>
The Stars beat the Wings, 4-3, Saturday at Bloomington, Minn. DAN HAFNER

NO SMOKING SIGN LIT ON PROFESSIONAL TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
BOWLING: TORRANCE TOURNAMENT OPENS SEASON. IT WILL BE FIRST IN WHICH POLICY 
BANNING SMOKING ON BENCH IS IN EFFECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bowlers will be smoking less on the national pro tour starting today. 
</P>
<P>
A ban on smoking in the settee or player bench areas goes into effect at Gable 
House Bowl in Torrance, where the Professional Bowlers Assn. starts its 29th 
year with the $175,000 AC/Delco tournament. 
</P>
<P>
To help minimize smokers' withdrawal symptoms, players can stand in walkways 
behind the no-smoking zones to light up. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Baker, a leading contender in the field of 160 bowlers, says: "Many of the 
pros have developed built-in habits to smoke between shots. It's nervous time, 
especially in the match play. 
</P>
<P>
"(So) it's very possible the new policy could affect bowling efficiency, at 
least until the smokers adjust to new procedures. It's an interesting 
pre-tournament thought to predict a Gable House winner. Will it be a smoker or 
a non-smoker?" 
</P>
<P>
The leading pros include both. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Randy Pedersen enjoys tobacco. So do Hall of Famer Mark Roth 
and Pete Weber, the 1989 high-average pro. 
</P>
<P>
Among the non-smokers are Amleto Monacelli, 1989 PBA player of the year; Mike 
Aulby, who set the single-year money record of $298,237 last year; Brian Voss; 
Parker Bohn III and Del Ballard Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Holman, another contender, is a smoker. 
</P>
<P>
Baker, 28 and a non-smoker, looks more like an NFL linebacker than a 
professional bowler. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4, 225-pounder starred in basketball and baseball at Garden Grove 
High School, but some early pro bowling victories persuaded him to turn down 
college scholarship offers. He is perhaps the only active pro bowler writing a 
column on the sport that isn't instructional. His weekly observations appear in 
the Pacific Bowler under the heading, "Baker Speaks," and recently they have 
included these opinions about other stars on the tour: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Monacelli, of Venezuela: "The most physically fit of all the pros . . . 
He's Mr. Jump Rope, Mr. Jogger and Mr. Aerobics all in one. The ball he throws 
has enormous power. It's still spinning when it hits the pins." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Aulby, of Indianpolis: "The best winner. He never throws away a victory 
when it's in sight." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Weber, of Florissant, Mo.: "Talentwise, there is none better. When he 
loses, he beats himself." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Holman, of Medford, Ore.: "He's my favorite. He's the only player I'll 
pay to watch bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Voss, now of Boca Raton, Fla.: "He has the looks of a winner. And he 
does when his shots are hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Pedersen, of Santa Maria: "Randy's wasting his time in bowling. He's a 
natural standup comic and could make a ton of money at it. He'll slay you with 
his Katharine Hepburn." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On Bohn, of Freehold, N.J.: "Parker will be there. He's a lefty, but bowls 
like a ripping right-hander the way he gets through the ball on delivery." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's longshot pick: "Mark Williams (of Beaumont, Tex.). He's tough to beat 
on TV." 
</P>
<P>
Baker's sentimental choice: "Me. I'm overdue." Baker was the high-average pro 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Bowling Notes 
</P>
<P>
The tournament will run day and night through Friday, then after 42 games -- 18 
in the preliminary rounds and 24 in the match-play semifinals -- the five top 
bowlers will shoot for the $35,000 first prize at noon Saturday in a four-game 
elimination final. ABC will televise the title rolloff. . . . Gable House has 
been remodeled recently, but the new automatic scorers will not be in 
operation. General Manager Mickey Cogan said the PBA's traditional manual 
scoreboard will be used. 
</P>
<P>
Other Southern Californians in the tournament are Frank Bellinder, Rick Berry, 
George Branham III, Ricky Corona, James Cox, Al Croteau Jr., Steve Dagel, Rick 
Easley, Tony Figuiera, Eric Forkel, Dave Frame, Cory Groth, Ric Hamlin, Russ 
Kallush, Phil Kapsimallis, Troy Kendrick, Cecil Knighton, Bobby Knipple, Jim 
Lewis, Rich Maldonado, Bob Markiewicz, Joe Merrill, Clarke Moore, Gary Morgan, 
Russell Namahoe, Nate Nouchi, Robert O'Connor, Bob Permann, Mick Prulhiere, 
Tony Rodriguez, Butch Soper, Jess Stayrook, Bill Stempke, Larry Stephens, Mike 
Taylor and Jim Tilton. 
</P>
<P>
PBA Commissoner Joe Antenora said the organization's new policy on smoking was 
approved at a recent meeting by "a good mixture of smokers and non-smokers" on 
an executive committee of bowlers and directors. Originally, the board voted to 
prohibit PBA players from smoking at all inside centers holding 1990 tour 
tournaments. The board then amended the ruling to allow smoking behind the 
player areas.

Pipeline Firm Wins Commitments: The Wyoming-California Pipeline Co. said it 
received firm long-term commitments to move 530 million cubic feet of natural 
gas, a sufficient volume to proceed with construction of a 30-inch pipeline 
from Wyoming to California. Construction is scheduled to start this year, and 
the $665-million pipeline could begin moving gas to California markets by late 
1991, the company said.

Truce in UAL Takeover Battle: Coniston Partners, a New York money manager, 
declared a truce in its takeover battle with UAL Corp. to give the company time 
to come up with its own recapitalization plan. 
</P>
<P>
The board of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, expects to have a plan by Jan. 
25. But United's pilots and flight attendants oppose a financial overhaul that 
doesn't include employee ownership. The pilots said they would "do everything 
in (our) power" to stop a deal that doesn't include employees. They plan to 
meet with UAL's board to discuss an employee transaction.

MGM/UA No Longer for Sale: Jeffrey C. Barbakow, chairman, president and chief 
executive of MGM/UA Communications Co., said the studio, which had been on the 
verge of being sold last year, will no longer be actively seeking a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided it's time to get moving with this company," Barbakow said at 
the company's annual shareholders meeting at the Beverly Hilton. Barbakow's 
announcement signifies that MGM/UA, which has been trying to sell itself for 
more than a year, appears to be moving back into the movie-making business. 
MGM/UA had drastically cut back its production and development activities. MGM 
released 26 movies in 1989.

JAPANESE PLAN SANTA ANA PROJECT; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THE $400-MILLION MAIN STREET VENTURE INCLUDES A 32-STORY OFFICE 
TOWER, SHOPS, A HOTEL AND HOUSING. 
</P>

<P>
A Japanese developer said Tuesday that it will build $400 million in office 
towers, shops, a hotel and housing north of Santa Ana's downtown in one of the 
largest real estate developments in the city. The complex will include a 
32-story office building that would be Orange County's tallest. 
</P>
<P>
The project forges another link in the massive redevelopment of Santa Ana's 
aging Main Street, which runs from the southern edge of the city to its 
northern boundary. 
</P>
<P>
Shimizu America Corp. will build the project -- tentatively called Main Street 
Concourse -- for the landowner, Orient Corp. Orient is Japan's largest consumer 
finance company. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 32-story building, a second, 20-story tower is planned. The 
project also includes residential, retail and entertainment facilities. In 
addition, a monorail station is part of the tentative plan for the project, 
which Mayor Daniel H. Young said brings the city's ambitious plans for a 
monorail line up Main Street a step closer to reality. 
</P>
<P>
"We envision it as a place to bring people back to the central city after work 
hours, a place where people want to stay," said Steven W. Spillman, a vice 
president at the Laguna Niguel developer Birtcher, which is advising Shimizu on 
the project. "The idea is it'll be a 16-hour community, instead of just a place 
to work." 
</P>
<P>
This is Orient's first project on the U.S. mainland. Shimizu has built office 
parks and hotels around the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
The project represents a major shift in Japanese real estate investment in 
Orange County, real estate experts said. Until now, most Japanese real estate 
investors merely bought buildings in the county rather than building their own. 
</P>
<P>
The property is across North Main Street from the MainPlace/Santa Ana mall, a 
few blocks from the Santa Ana and Garden Grove freeways in central Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Shimuzu doesn't have approval to build the project, which is larger than all 
but a few real estate developments in this city of 237,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and the developer, however, say they expect that Concourse will 
be approved much as the developer presented it Tuesday to the press, although 
that could take as long as 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Shimuzu said it expects to complete by 1993 the construction of 
32-story office tower, 150,000 square feet of shops, 32,000 square feet of 
cafe, exhibit space and meeting space, six movie theaters, two restaurants, a 
3,000-space parking garage and 264 condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase includes a second, 20-story office tower, 1,200 more spaces in 
the eight-story parking garage, a 350-room hotel, a 16-story tower with 192 
condominiums and another 40,000 square feet or so of stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Three stories of shops, meeting and exhibit space will front on Main Street, 
separated from the two office towers and the parking garage by a pedestrian 
concourse. Behind the offices will be the two towers of the hotel, and behind 
that at the far end of the 18-acre lot will be the housing. 
</P>
<P>
Concourse also marks a shifting of the center of Santa Ana from its historic 
downtown to further north along Main Street, said Scott Perley of commercial 
real estate broker Cushman &amp; Wakefield. There's the big MainPlace mall 
across North Main Street, where developer C. J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons also 
plans three office towers, including one of 31 stories. There are the two 
freeways. And there are also plans to redevelop the sprawling Town and Country 
Center just across the city line in Orange, an area of one-story stores. 
</P>
<P>
"This is becoming Santa Ana's new downtown, and Orange's too for that matter," 
said Perley. 
</P>
<P>
So dense is development becoming along North Main Street that a monorail or 
some other form of transportation may be necessary lest the area choke on 
traffic, said Mayor Young, one of the monorail's most ardent supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"The monorail is critical to achieving buildout along Main Street, because 
developments like Concourse are going to increase traffic," he said. "But if 
it's successful, we'll have a way to move people through central Orange County 
far more efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana ordered a study late last year of a monorail system that could 
eventually stretch from Fullerton, in the northern end of the county, down 
through the thickly populated cities of Anaheim and Santa Ana to the booming 
office neighborhood around John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
If developers build the terminals, which are one-third the cost of building a 
monorail system, said Young, a private company might be able to build and run 
the system at a profit and without public funds. Should that not prove 
feasible, Young concedes that he doesn't know where public funds would come 
from for such a system. 
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, Orange County's biggest developers -- and developers from 
elsewhere too -- have begun building office towers in the county's central 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The new office towers went up first around Anaheim Stadium and have spread 
through neighborhoods that, in some cases, were until recently seedy industrial 
neighborhoods or -- in the case of Concourse -- land that had always been 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
It amounts to a long-awaited payoff for struggling redevelopment programs in 
the county's older cities like Anaheim and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim on Tuesday gave final approval to sell 16 acres of vacant downtown land 
to Koll Co. for $2 million. Koll will build offices, a hotel and a movie 
theater on the property.

AMI Predicts Quarterly Loss: Executives at American Medical International 
estimate that the company will have a first-quarter loss of between $50 million 
and $60 million. Corporate officers at the Beverly Hills-based hospital chain 
said the loss for the quarter ended Nov. 30 will stem from $120 million in 
costs incurred when IMA Holdings Corp. acquired AMI. The charges include fees 
to investment bankers and severance pay to AMI executives.

Bristol-Myers to Post 4th-Quarter Charges: Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. said it is 
taking two fourth-quarter charges totaling about $690 million after tax as it 
continues the process of blending two big pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
The larger charge, an estimated $740 million before tax, will be taken as part 
of a plan to integrate newly merged businesses and reorganize on a worldwide 
basis. The two charges will reduce after-tax income by about $690 million. 
Financial results for the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, are due to be 
issued later this month.

U.S. TO PROBE RECENT JUMP IN OIL PRICES 
</P>

The Justice Department is looking into the recent surge in oil prices to 
determine whether price collusion took place, an Energy Department official 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Asst. Energy Secretary John Easton told a House subcommittee that the Justice 
Department has received numerous complaints about high price increases for 
heating oil and natural gas during December's record cold weather. In some 
areas, retail prices rose by 50% or more. 
</P>
<P>
The retail price jump coincided with a 60% jump in heating oil prices on 
futures markets, but prices have since fallen sharply and the wholesale market 
prices would not have immediately affected the price of oil held by wholesalers 
and retailers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Justice Department currently is reviewing those complaints in its effort 
to determine whether a formal investigation is warranted into the question of 
whether collusion may have occurred here," Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
He said price increases would be unlawful under antitrust laws if they were 
made in collusion among competitors, but would be legal if they were taken 
individually. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, New York Gov. Mario Cuomo called on the Justice Department to 
investigate the rise in heating oil prices. His office said retail prices had 
jumped as much as 50 cents to $1.50 a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The governors of five New England states have written to the Energy Department 
asking for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Easton said record cold temperatures in most of the country during December 
increased demand for distillate oil by over 1 million barrels a day and there 
were problems in delivering more energy supplies to the affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't tolerate these kinds of price increases," Rep. Edward Markey, 
(D-Mass.), told Easton. 
</P>
<P>
"In response to this increased demand there is evidence that additional 
supplies of product are moving into the affected regions, not only making more 
product available, but also exerting downward pressure on the higher prices we 
saw at the end of December," said Easton.

ARCHIVE, CIPHER DATA FAIL IN BID FOR STANDSTILL PACT

Negotiations between Cipher Data Products and Archive Corp. concerning a 
possible confidentiality and standstill agreement have been terminated, the 
companies said Tuesday. No agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa-based Archive, which owns a 4.6% stake in San Diego-based Cipher 
Data, launched a hostile, $7.50-per-share tender offer for the Cipher Data 
shares it does not own on Dec. 19. Cipher Data's board rejected the offer as 
inadequate last Friday, and said it had retained First Boston Corp. to solicit 
higher bids. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Monday, the rival computer tape-drive companies said they would try to 
hammer out a confidentiality and standstill agreement as a precondition to 
discussions of a possible sweetened $8-per-share bid by Archive. Those 
agreements are used by companies to exchange non-public information under the 
proviso that neither party will take unfair advantage of the information, 
including the purchase of shares under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Cipher Data executives were not available to comment on why the talks broke 
down. Archive said in a statement that the reason was that it would not agree 
to Cipher Data's demand that it not accept shares pursuant to its tender offer 
for a 90-day period while Cipher looked for other bids. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement Tuesday, Archive Chairman D. Howard Lewis said that his company 
was still willing to negotiate a friendly acquisition of Cipher Data at a price 
of $8 a share but that it would not formally change the terms of its tender 
offer without information from Cipher that "would support a price higher than 
$7.50 a share." 
</P>
<P>
Archive Vice President of Finance, B. J. Rone, who described Cipher Data's 
demand as "unusual and surprising," said Cipher Data shareholders have begun to 
tender their shares but that he did know the total. Archive's tender offer 
expires Jan. 22.

JAPANESE FIRMS PLAN TO REDUCE OUTPUT OF KEY COMPUTER CHIPS

Leading Japanese semiconductor makers said Tuesday that they plan 10% to 15% 
cuts in production of key 1-megabit memory chips because of falling prices and 
lower demand. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for 1-megabit dynamic random-access memory chips, or DRAMs, has fallen 
in recent months, in large part because of stagnant sales of personal computers 
in the United States, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A 1-megabit chip, currently a mainstay of the computer industry, can store 
about 1 million binary units of information, the equivalent of about four 
newspaper pages. 
</P>
<P>
An official at NEC Corp., the world's largest semiconductor maker, said his 
company has decided to reduce production from 6 million chips to about 5 
million a month in the first quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
"With the price for a 1-megabit DRAM falling from around $24 last summer to 
$9.70 today, NEC has decided to downshift production," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although computer sales in Japan have remained stronger than in the United 
States, prices of 1-megabit DRAMs also have fallen here, to about $10.50 from 
$14. 
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor industry is known for its sharp business cycles. During a 
1985-86 industry recession, Japanese makers, suffering from overcapacity, lost 
an estimated $4 billion and began a series of price cuts that led to charges of 
dumping overseas. 
</P>
<P>
An Oki Electric official said his company plans to reduce its production of 
1-megabit DRAMs this quarter from 3.5 million chips to fewer than 3 million 
chips a month. 
</P>
<P>
Hitachi's production has fallen from 4 million chips to about 3.8 million chips 
a month, while Mitsubishi Electric's monthly production has fallen from about 5 
million chips to between 4 million and 4.5 million chips, company officials 
said. A Hitachi official said further cuts were possible if the market 
continues to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
Fujitsu officials declined to comment on their production plans.

BRAND NAMES PUT TO TEST IN SURVEY; 
</P>
<P>
CONSUMERS: MERCEDES-BENZ, KODAK COME OUT ON TOP IN A REPORT THAT ATTEMPTS TO 
COMPARE PERCEPTIONS OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS.

<P>
A survey of items as diverse as candy bars and health insurance found that 
consumers think Mercedes-Benz automobiles and Kodak film are tops in quality 
but that Continental Airlines and the rock music video channel MTV rank near 
the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Coke and Pepsi are dead even in terms of perceived quality, but the Pepsi 
generation seems more satisfied with its cola. And while Toyota owners are 
among the most loyal of any brand-name devotees, the average American says 
Buick offers more quality. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, results of which were released Tuesday, is one of only a few that 
have attempted to compare consumers' impressions of brand-name products in 
different market categories. 
</P>
<P>
According to the study, done by Total Research Corp., Levi's jeans were 
perceived to be a higher-quality product than Maxwell House coffee, and 
Michelin tires had a much better image than Aqua-Fresh toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
John Morton, who developed the idea for the research, said the broad 
perspective demonstrates that even products that are strong within their field 
sometimes need an image boost. 
</P>
<P>
"You get lost in your own product category and you may think you're doing 
pretty well when actually you're very vulnerable," said Morton, senior vice 
president of Total Research. 
</P>
<P>
Examples of vulnerable brands, he said, are Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Holiday Inn 
and Lipton Soup. All ranked relatively high on an awareness scale but ranked 
lower in terms of consumers' perceptions of quality. More importantly, regular 
consumers of these brands gave them relatively weak ratings. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more surprising results of the survey was the relatively low-quality 
ratings given by consumers to all fast-food restaurants. Despite its dominant 
position in the field, McDonald's fared no better than Burger King or Wendy's, 
the other two chains included in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling about the fast-food restaurants is that their primary advantage to 
the public is price, convenience, speed and so forth," Morton said. "Nobody has 
really tried to establish quality in that field." 
</P>
<P>
Other poor performers included cold remedies and airlines in general, although 
Continental Airlines stood near the bottom of every ranking. 
</P>
<P>
The airline, a unit of Texas Air Inc., ranked 89th out of 91 brands in terms of 
quality and 90th in terms of awareness. In a ranking of quality as perceived by 
regular customers, the airline ranked last. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also held some surprises among automobile brands, with Buick ranking 
well above Ford and Dodge, particularly among consumers who owned the various 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
MTV, which ranked at the very bottom of the list of consumers' perceptions of 
quality, was also considered the most controversial brand on the telephone 
survey of 1,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
Among loyal viewers, however, the music-video cable channel fared relatively 
well, indicating that MTV performs well among a limited market segment. 
</P>
<P>
The brands included in the survey, representing 33 product and service 
categories, were selected in an attempt to represent what Morton called "the 
entire consumer experience." 
</P>
<P>
From the results of the survey, the Princeton, N.J.-based research company 
determined that consumers can be classified in one of seven categories that can 
help predict their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
The company said consumers tend to determine quality on the basis of whether 
products are sophisticated, practical, sentimental, project an image of energy, 
provide relief or escape, help in the struggle for popularity or reflect a "new 
traditionalism." 
</P>
<P>
Morton said Total Research hopes to sell the survey data to corporations 
included in the research or to their rivals. Subscriptions will cost $35,000 or 
$60,000, depending on how much information the subscriber wants. 
</P>
<P>
THE BEST AND THE WORST 
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of consumer attitudes toward 91 brand names conducted by 
Total Research Corp. in Princeton, N.J., the following products ranked in terms 
of perceived quality. The products were rated on a theoretical scale of 0 to 
100, with 100 representing a perfect product. The results were based on 
telephone interviews with respondents in 1,000 households nationwide in 
November and December.

HOT PROPERTY: A $400-million development near downtown Santa Ana (D1), one of 
the largest funded by Japanese money in Orange County, is only the latest in a 
wave of Japanese investment in local real estate. . . . The binge started in 
1985, and in 1988 alone totaled $506 million, and analysts expect the 1989 
total to be about the same. . . . "Orange County will continue through the '90s 
to be a preferred investment location" for Pacific Rim investors, said one 
consultant. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons

SUCH A DEAL: When Disneyland signed up former President Ronald Reagan for its 
35th anniversary celebration Thursday (A1), it received Reagan's bargain rate. 
. . . He charged a Japanese media conglomerate $2 million for appearances last 
October, but his trip to the Magic Kingdom is costing the park only $50,000 in 
the way of a donation to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. . . . Reagan was 
invited, along with actor Robert Cummings and TV personality Art Linkletter, 
because the three men hosted the park's opening-day telecast on July 17, 1955.

WHAT A DUMP: O.C. CANYON HAILED AS LANDFILL OF FUTURE

BEE CANYON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County sanitation officials have spent 10 years and $50 million 
transforming this backcountry canyon into something resembling an oversize 
kitchen trash can. 
</P>
<P>
Scores of workers have lined the canyon bottom and walls with thousands of 
yards of plastic as officials prepare to open the newest -- and most 
anticipated -- commercial landfill in California. 
</P>
<P>
Bee Canyon is being heralded as one of the most environmentally sound waste 
disposal sites in California, and if successful, the remote facility four miles 
northeast of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station could become a model for 
future landfills around the state. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a state-of-the-art landfill, and we will ask other counties in 
California to use its design," said Dixie Lass, a senior engineering geologist 
for the state Regional Water Quality Control Board in Riverside. She said 
county officials went beyond what was required by state law to construct Bee 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"This system is the best compromise between unbelievable high cost and 
protection of the environment," she said. "The compromise certainly favors the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
Trash heaps, junkyards and dumps are distant cousins to Bee Canyon, which is 
scheduled to open in March. 
</P>
<P>
What sets Bee Canyon apart is the extraordinary measures taken to protect the 
surrounding environment, especially the ground water. The bottom of the canyon, 
nearly a mile long, is lined with several layers of clay, plastic and a 
synthetic filter fabric to prevent pollutants from seeping into the ground. As 
insurance, an intricate drainage system has been installed to capture any 
contaminated water or chemicals that might trickle through the liner. The 
drainage system diverts rainwater runoff around the landfill, instead of 
through it. 
</P>
<P>
The technology to safeguard Bee Canyon in the oak-covered backcountry is state 
of the art. But the result is not much different than lining the kitchen 
garbage can with a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a high-tech landfill," said Casey Harris, construction manager for 
Butier Engineering, the Huntington Beach firm building the landfill. "In 28 or 
30 years it will be sealed up and become a regional park." 
</P>
<P>
Bert Scott, director of the county's General Services Agency, said that when 
the landfill is complete around 2020, he hopes the site will become a regional 
park or a golf course. Another option, he said, will be to return the area to a 
natural state, limiting access so the native chaparral and wildlife might 
return. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope that it will be developed into something that will get the 
maximum worthwhile public use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Facing a growing solid waste crisis, county officials hope that Bee Canyon will 
relieve pressure on two other landfills in the county that are expected to 
close soon. Coyote Canyon landfill in the San Joaquin Hills near Newport Beach 
will close when Bee Canyon opens, and Santiago Canyon landfill east of Orange 
is scheduled to close in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
That will leave sanitation officials with three landfills -- Bee Canyon, Prima 
Deshecha Canyon east of San Juan Capistrano and Brea-Olinda Canyon east of Brea 
-- to handle its mounting trash load. The county is studying other locations 
for new landfills, but it could be years before a site is identified and years 
before it is ready for actual use, underscoring the importance of Bee Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the county discards about 4.4 million tons of trash -- about 2.2 
tons for every man, woman and child, the highest per capita ratio of any county 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Without Bee Canyon the county would be in a trash crunch, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We are lucky in a sense that we can open a new landfill," said Vicki Wilson, 
assistant director of the county's waste management program. "Most other places 
in California and in the nation have no more room for landfills. Bee Canyon 
includes the latest technology available." 
</P>
<P>
Bee Canyon did not evolve smoothly as a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The county bought the 725-acre canyon from the Irvine Co. for $8.5 million in 
1985, six years after it was designated a landfill site. It has taken officials 
nearly a decade to get the needed permits for construction as well as satisfy 
layers of stringent environmental requirements mandated by the state Regional 
Water Quality Control Board. Since the project was conceived, the county has 
worked with 17 regulatory agencies, slowing the process and frustrating its 
proponents. 
</P>
<P>
And there was a legal obstacle as well. The city of Irvine filed a lawsuit in 
1983 to block the opening of the landfill. In the end, Irvine dropped the suit 
in exchange for restricting use of the landfill to commercial trash trucks. In 
addition, dumping will be limited initially to 6,000 tons a day and no more 
than about 1,000 commercial trash trucks will be allowed to use the landfill 
each day. The city also extracted several environmental concessions including 
an agreement by the county to replace each oak tree destroyed during 
construction with seven new trees. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the delays, county officials say the struggle to secure Bee Canyon's 
opening has been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"It is awesome looking," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose 3rd District 
includes Bee Canyon as well as the Brea-Olinda and Prima Deshecha landfills. 
"It looks like a giant bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The mammoth crater formed by Bee Canyon is designed to hold more than 1 million 
cubic yards of non-hazardous solid waste. When filled with trash and dirt, the 
canyon will be 410 feet higher -- the equivalent of a 34-story building. The 
canyon is so large, it would take a giant earthmover -- working eight hours a 
day, 365 days a year -- nearly 100 years to fill the basin. 
</P>
<P>
Actual construction of the landfill has taken more than two years, including 
work on a three-mile extension of Sand Canyon Avenue between Irvine Boulevard 
and the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
To protect the ground water beneath the canyon from water and methane gas 
pollution, the floor and sides of the canyon are covered with from one to two 
feet of firm, fine-grained clay. On top of the clay, engineers placed a thick 
polyethylene plastic liner, then two feet of sand, a layer of high-tech filter 
fabric, followed by two feet of topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
An extensive drainage system above and below the thick linoleumlike liner 
guides the water and leached liquids into big sumps at the lowest part of the 
canyon. Water collected from beneath the liner will be sprayed back on the 
landfill to control dust, while the more potentially toxic liquids trapped by 
the liner and drained into the sump will be tested and disposed of off-site. 
</P>
<P>
When in full operation, computers will be used to identify, weigh and bill 
trucks entering the three fee gates. The trucks will no longer have to stop on 
the scales and be billed by an attendant. 
</P>
<P>
Trash will be coming in from homes and businesses in Irvine, Costa Mesa, 
Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, Westminster and Midway City. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez says the hefty price tag to prepare and open Bee Canyon as a landfill 
is an investment in the future. But he cautioned that it represents only part 
of an overall effort to deal with the county's growing trash crisis. 
</P>
<P>
New ways must be found, he said, to dispose of "green wastes" such as leaves 
and grass and the millions of troublesome automobile and truck tires that are 
filling precious space in the county's dwindling landfills. 
</P>
<P>
Under current laws, the county is expected by the year 2000 to reduce through 
recycling and other means 50% of what it now dumps in landfills. 
</P>
<P>
"The new landfill is an expensive undertaking, but I believe the public is 
willing to support it," said Vasquez, adding that the cost will eventually be 
repaid by dumping fees. "It is kind of like the old saying, 'pay me now or pay 
me later.' " 
</P>
<P>
But, he said some cities are looking at paying as much as a $100 per ton to 
have trash hauled long distances. 
</P>
<P>
"They are paying for poor planning," he said. "Hopefully, we can avoid that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tons of Trash Per Day 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda: 3,422 tons: 23.82% 
</P>
<P>
Coyote Canyon: 4,561 tons: 31.75% 
</P>
<P>
Santiago Canyon: 2,894: 20.15% 
</P>
<P>
Prima Deshecha: 3,488 tons: 24.28% 
</P>
<P>
Total: 14,365 tons per day 
</P>
<P>
After the closing of the Coyote Canyon landfill, the new Bee Canyon Sanitary 
Landfill would handle 6,000 tons of trash per day.

PIERSIDE'S FOES PROTEST DONOR TAX WRITE-OFF

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's largest land developer got a huge tax write-off in a deal involving 
public-access beach land and the Pierside Village development project, 
according to a citizens group. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Huntington Beach Tomorrow, said the city allowed the Huntington 
Beach Co., the largest private landholder in the city, to claim a valuation of 
$3 million for oceanfront property previously valued at just $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
City and company officials acknowledged that the assessed value of the land had 
changed but said there is nothing out of line in the arrangement. The deal 
allowed the Huntington Beach Co. to claim the higher value in exchange for 
donating it free to the city to make way for Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
But leaders of Huntington Beach Tomorrow said the public was the loser in the 
deal because for the last 57 years the land has been a public easement -- land 
that the public has a right to use -- as a means to park and get to the beach. 
It would become commercial property under the city's Pierside Village proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The land at issue is a narrow strip -- about two acres in total -- that extends 
along the ocean from Main to Lake streets. Since 1932, the land has been a 
public easement to the city's well-known beach and pier at Main Street and 
Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
The city had long sought full title to the land in hope of using it for 
Pierside Village. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell's Restaurant and a series of paved parking lots are now on the land. 
The project would relocate and renovate Maxwell's and add two more oceanfront 
restaurants, plus a plaza with some small shops. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Tomorrow and Save Our Parks, two citizens groups that advocate 
"managed growth," have strenuously opposed the project. They hold that the 
proposed new commercial buildings would ruin the beach's access and view. 
</P>
<P>
In a newsletter mailed this week, Huntington Beach Tomorrow did not accuse the 
city or the Huntington Beach Co. of illegality in the land-gift deed. But the 
newsletter asked: "Did they (the Huntington Beach Co.) get a huge tax write-off 
for giving away nothing? . . . How could the value be $3 million when the city 
had it appraised at $10,000?" 
</P>
<P>
Public documents on file in the city confirm that the Huntington Beach Co. 
claimed the $3-million valuation in deeding the tract to the city. But a 
company official, William Holman, said in an interview that the new valuation 
simply reflected the actual worth of the land. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Paul E. Cook said that while the city would have never paid 
$3 million to buy the land, it did not contest the company's higher valuation 
when the company offered the land as a gift. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the price the company set on the land as a tax write-off, and I guess 
without any restrictions on the land, that's the kind of price it could bring," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook noted, however, that the land does have building restrictions because it 
was dedicated as a public easement. 
</P>
<P>
Holman, a project manager for the Huntington Beach Co., said in an interview 
that the company claimed a $3-million value because the land is worth that 
much, noting that it is strategically situated and virtually at the front door 
of the beach city. 
</P>
<P>
"Three million dollars was the estimate because that is the value we placed on 
the property," Holman said. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said the $10,000 valuation placed on the property in 1986 reflected the 
strict restrictions on the land's use. But he added that without such 
restrictions, the land would be much more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposal to Buy 
</P>
<P>
Documents on file at City Hall show that the city sent the Huntington Beach Co. 
a letter, dated Feb. 27, 1986, proposing to buy that company's partial 
ownership of the beach strip. 
</P>
<P>
The letter, signed by then-City Administrator Charles W. Thompson, said the 
city had "received an appraisal of your interest in the property. . . . This 
appraisal, which the city and the (Redevelopment) Agency feel reflects an 
accurate and fair market value, concludes that the value interest is $10,000." 
</P>
<P>
That value, Thompson added, did not include oil or natural gas rights, which 
the city did not need to buy with the land. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's letter said the city had been prepared to offer the Huntington Beach 
Co. $40,000 for the land. Thompson said the amount took into consideration 
money the company might have to spend in handling an eminent domain case. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Co. rejected the offer, but by December, 1986, according 
to the public documents, the firm offered to donate the surface rights to the 
city at no cost -- provided that the city drop eminent domain proceedings. The 
company's proposal also called upon the city to accept a much higher land 
valuation. 
</P>
<P>
The city's agreement with the Huntington Beach Co., dated Dec. 11, 1986, said 
the Huntington Beach Co. "values the real property at $3,000,000 and City does 
not contest the valuation of the property." 
</P>
<P>
The company retained the right to any oil and natural gas under the beach land. 
Holman said the Huntington Beach Co. frequently keeps mineral rights when it 
sells or donates land. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Tomorrow's newsletter questioned whether the company had 
actually given up all land surface rights in deeding the property to the city. 
The newsletter noted that one paragraph of the deed says that the Huntington 
Beach Co. "further excepts and reserves, the right to receive any sums, 
including rental, royalties or other payments, due or to become due under or by 
virtue of any lease, including without limitation any oil and gas lease or 
agreement affecting said real property." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Company Collect? 
</P>
<P>
Debbie Cook of Huntington Beach Tomorrow said that language raises questions 
about whether the Huntington Beach Co. could still collect part of any money 
from restaurants and other commercial establishments planned to be built on the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
But Holman said the company "never had any interest in future rental 
conditions, nor do we now." 
</P>
<P>
Holman said the paragraph protects only the Huntington Beach Co.'s right to any 
oil and gas that might later be extracted from under the land. 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Gail C. Hutton similarly said she interprets the rental paragraph to 
affect only underground rights retained by the Huntington Beach Co. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said Huntington Beach Tomorrow and Save Our Parks are still concerned with 
the city's handling of the beach land, regardless of the explanations of the 
deed and $3-million valuation. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents of this city own the rights to this (beach) land for 
recreational purposes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She said Pierside Village would take away those public-access rights by 
commercializing the land and added that the two citizens groups will continue 
to oppose the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Cook vowed that the city will continue to work for the 
project and hoped to negotiate a settlement with the State Lands Commission, 
which is trying to block the development. 
</P>
<P>
The State Lands Commission, which by state law owns and controls all the land 
from high tide to three miles out to sea, has said Pierside Village would 
restrict public access to the tidelands.

DIANNE KLEIN: WE ALL DIE A BIT DAILY, BUT COUNSELOR EASES FINAL STEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The hopeless seek out Caroline Youngquist. They call and they stop by: AIDS 
patients, the disabled, the old and ailing. 
</P>
<P>
She can offer them no miracle medicines or cures of faith. Nor does she want 
to. 
</P>
<P>
For these people, Youngquist believes, it is time to die. So she endeavors to 
help them do so. With dignity. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a hell of a lot of courage to take your own life," Youngquist says, 
staring me straight in the eye. "I hope that when my time comes, I'll have the 
courage to take my own." 
</P>
<P>
Caroline Youngquist, 79, full of fire and warmth, is Orange County's volunteer 
representative for the Hemlock Society, a right-to-die organization that hopes 
one day to legalize doctor-assisted suicide for the terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
Although she stresses that she has not directly assisted in anyone's death, a 
felony under California law, Youngquist refers people to literature that 
outlines, in precise detail, how they may painlessly take their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
She believes that many have. 
</P>
<P>
"So many people come here," she says with a wave of her arm toward the living 
room of her Leisure World townhouse. "These people are usually perfect 
strangers, from around here, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Corona. We 
talk, and then, I forget about them. It's better that way. We protect 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, she says, it is the ill who ask for her help; other times, those who 
cannot stand to see them suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"I do have people who come back and call," she says. "They are very grateful." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that I was rather astounded by what Youngquist told me when I 
visited her the other day. This strong woman with the oversize glasses and the 
fringe of white hair gave me unadorned talk about euthanasia: what some call 
murder, others compassion. 
</P>
<P>
I had expected polemics, perhaps some stridency. But to Youngquist, the issue 
is starkly simple and supremely private. She and others have the right to die 
quickly and without pain. They will do so. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Youngquist distributes durable power of attorney forms, a legal 
document that allows patients to direct their own medical care, and copies of 
"Let Me Die Before I Wake," a guide to "self-deliverance" written by Hemlock 
Society founder Derek Humphry. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, there is a very good way of taking your own life," Youngquist tells me 
while leafing through the Hemlock Society newsletters and right-to-die books 
that she has stacked on the dining room table. "And here it is." 
</P>
<P>
With that she hands me a drug dosage table, published by the Hemlock Society 
with the printed admonishment to "keep this document in a secure, private 
place," and then asks me to please keep this information to myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very sorry for them," she says of those who come to share their pain. 
"I've suffered myself. That's why I can help." 
</P>
<P>
Youngquist acknowledges that hers is a position many do not share. Some object 
to the idea of a physician taking a life, others call suicide a sin and still 
others worry that the old and disabled could feel pressured to die. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly feel no pressure whatsoever," Youngquist says. "If I find out I 
have cancer, for example, I don't want to go through the chemotherapy, the 
hospitals, all that, not at my age. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people do go through with it (treatment). They live six months, or 
five years, more. I don't want to do that. It's time to call it a life. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not a sin. It's more of a sin for the hospital and doctors to keep 
people alive artificially. In the good old days, my mother, my grandmother, 
they got sick and they died. Today they keep people alive artificially. Every 
day, there are people who are begging to die. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody here in Leisure World should be a member (of the Hemlock Society), 
for heaven's sake." 
</P>
<P>
As it is, Youngquist says 6,500 Leisure World residents signed a petition to 
place an initiative on the ballot in 1988 that would legalize doctor-assisted 
suicide for the terminally ill. She says that number would surely have been 
higher if organizers had had the money to hire professional signature 
gatherers. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, the initiative failed to qualify after proponents collected fewer 
than than half the required signatures. A coalition has formed to place the 
renamed Death with Dignity Act on the ballot in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
So until then, Youngquist says, she will try to stay off the soapbox. The 
Hemlock Society has no formal meetings in Orange County -- "we have enough 
organizations in Leisure World" -- and besides, she's busy enough with 
everything else. 
</P>
<P>
She is an accomplished, self-taught sculptor. She has friends and male 
companions -- "I think it's foolish for someone my age to get married again" -- 
and a home that stands as a testament to her vitality. 
</P>
<P>
In March, she installed a parquet floor in her entryway -- "The trouble with 
you young people is you don't know the joy of doing things for yourself" -- and 
after that, she knocked out a wall in the upstairs bedroom to let in more 
light. 
</P>
<P>
Hanging in the kitchen is the gold key that Weight Watchers recently gave her 
in exchange for losing 22 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Youngquist, who has survived three husbands, asks me not to mention her age -- 
"I had a boyfriend who was 12 years younger than me, and he thought we were the 
same age" -- but later she says she supposes it really wouldn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"No, I don't like old age," she says, running her fingers through her hair. "I 
look in the mirror and I think, 'Dear God, I look terrible.' But . . . what are 
you going to do? There ain't no golden years."

DEVELOPER GETS QUICK REVERSAL OF COUNCIL VOTE; 
</P>
<P>
ZONING: A 7-0 VOTE TO REVISE A RESIDENTIAL PROJECT WAS RECONSIDERED AFTER A

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The largest planned residential development in the history of the city got a 
last-minute change late Monday after the general manager of the development 
company unexpectedly showed up at City Hall and expressed displeasure with a 
City Council vote on the project. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Work, vice president and general manager of the Huntington Beach Co., 
came to the council meeting about 11 p.m., just minutes after members had 
voted, 7-0, to revise the proposed Holly-Seacliff plan 
</P>
<P>
to allow for some light industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
While the council was taking a break, Work told Councilman John Erskine that 
company officials objected to the industrial revision. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial development is less profitable than residential development, city 
and company officials subsequently acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
When the council reconvened a few minutes later, Erskine suggested that members 
reconsider. The council then voted 5-2 to keep the plan the way Work and his 
company wanted. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Grace Winchell and Councilman Peter M. Green, both outspoken 
environmentalists and frequent critics of development, cast the dissenting 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
Green said Tuesday that he is bitterly disappointed that the council majority 
so quickly agreed to reverse its vote after Work complained: "It shows we live 
in a company town, and that company is the Huntington Beach Co." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell said, "The Huntington Beach Co. pulled the strings of their puppets" 
and added that the company's last-minute lobbying was a "blatant example" of 
how the large development firm dominates Huntington Beach politics. 
</P>
<P>
The council's initial revision of the Holly-Seacliff plan -- a 768-acre 
development calling for about 4,400 new residences -- involved designating land 
along Gothard Street for "mixed development," which allows for some light 
industry. City staffers had recommended the change, saying Huntington Beach 
needs to keep some non-residential areas "to bring jobs to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Co. officials, however, wanted to make Gothard Street a 
mixed-density residential area. 
</P>
<P>
John Fisher, a member of the citizens groups Huntington Beach Tomorrow and Save 
Our Parks, also criticized the council's quick change of vote. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher said that he considers the council majority to be subservient to the 
wishes of the development firm and that he was told that Work had been watching 
the council meeting on cable TV at his home, across the street from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Work rushed to the meeting to express his displeasure after the council had 
made the Gothard Street change, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
Work could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
William Holman, a spokesman and project manager for the Huntington Beach Co., 
said he is unsure of whether Work was already at the council meeting or had 
come from home after learning of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
But Holman said he had joined Work on Monday night in telling council members 
during their 11 p.m. recess that the company did not like the mixed-development 
change. 
</P>
<P>
"We made our feelings known to the council people present there," he said 
Tuesday. "Mixed development carries some design problems and some environmental 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Holman, however, conceded that potential profits figured in the company's 
opposition to the Gothard Street change: "In a city like Huntington Beach, 
industrial land does not command as much as residential land commands." 
</P>
<P>
Erskine on Tuesday defended his action in moving for immediate reconsideration 
of the Gothard Street zoning after Work complained. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not just the landowner who was unhappy with making the area into mixed 
development," he said. "Some residents of the Village Court condo development 
along Main Street also said they didn't like it, and they talked to us when we 
took our break last night." 
</P>
<P>
Erskine said the council had quickly and unexpectedly come up with the 
mixed-density revision of Gothard Street during their debate of Holly-Seacliff 
on Monday night: "It was sort of a hybrid land arrangement that we came up with 
during the heat of straw votes. . . . It was not a burning issue with any of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Erskine said he talked to Work during the 11 p.m. break "because the major 
landowner" -- the Huntington Beach Co. owns 80% of the project area -- had 
concerns about the proposed revision. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting Tuesday on the criticism that the reconsideration vote brought, 
Erskine said: "It never looks good to some when you listen to a property 
owner." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell and Green said the Huntington Beach Co.'s objections would have been 
heard eventually and did not need an immediate vote Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we should have studied this more before taking another vote," 
Winchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"This (vote change) was a very blatant example of who's writing the bottom 
line," she said. "It must have been very important to the company, because they 
chose to do it right out there in front of God and everyone."

NIXON LIBRARY UNVEILS PLANS FOR 'FACE-TO-FACE' DIALOGUE

Designers of a video-image exhibit of Richard M. Nixon at his planned 
presidential library say guests will be able to step forward and ask the former 
president a question or two. 
</P>
<P>
They hope that those who do will feel as if they have actually talked to the 
former president. With the latest in computer wizardry and more than 400 video 
clips, the questioner will touch a screen and trigger an answer that appears 
from the former president's lips. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as if by some form of fortune, you actually met the president," designer 
Alex Cranstoun said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Nixon's 77th birthday, officials at the Richard M. Nixon Library 
and Birthplace that is under construction here unveiled new architectural 
drawings and described for the first time their plans to develop 
Disneyland-style, high-tech exhibits with the latest in so-called "interactive 
multimedia." 
</P>
<P>
Cranstoun said that "The Room of World Leaders" should appear as a "cocktail 
party after a major summit meeting" in which visitors can touch a video screen 
and hear comments from the participants about Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Images of the Vietnam War, he said, will be displayed in an exhibit that 
duplicates the living room of a 1960s "middle-American home" where the war 
unfolded on television. 
</P>
<P>
There will also be a room dedicated to the Watergate scandal that toppled 
Nixon's presidency. It will contain elements from all sides of the issue, 
including a machine that will play excerpts from the famous White House tapes, 
said Hugh Hewitt, director of the library foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The events of the scandal will be displayed in chronological order, starting 
with the break-in at the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel and 
ending with a large photograph of Nixon waving from the steps of a helicopter 
as he left the White House following his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the greatest court of public opinion will focus on this room, 
and therefore there is the need for full and fair treatment," said Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
Cranstoun, who worked on both the Johnson and Carter presidential libraries as 
well as the 1992 World Fair planned in Spain, said Nixon wanted the library to 
include a section on Watergate. He said Nixon has not put any restrictions on 
what it should contain. 
</P>
<P>
The library will also include a research area for scholars that will contain 
original documents from before and after Nixon's presidency. However, unlike 
other presidential libraries that maintain records from the presidential 
administration, the documents from Nixon's presidency were turned over to the 
National Archives and Records Administration by an act of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Privately Funded 
</P>
<P>
Nixon's $20-million library is being completely funded by private contributors 
more than 15 years after his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
The Ronald Reagan presidential library in Ventura County is expected to cost at 
least $40 million in private funds when it opens in February, 1991. However, 
taxpayers will foot the $1.5-million cost of maintaining the Reagan library. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon library is scheduled to open July 20 at a ceremony that the former 
president, who now lives in New Jersey, is expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the construction of the library, the project is also renovating, 
for $400,000, the Yorba Linda home in which Nixon was born. 
</P>
<P>
The Nixon library tour will begin with a 16-minute movie that is entitled -- at 
least for now -- "Comeback." The movie will track Nixon's career from his 
congressional race in 1942 through the present. 
</P>
<P>
The largest exhibit space in the library will be dedicated to foreign affairs 
and Nixon's meetings with world leaders. In one room, the life-size images of 
10 foreign leaders will appear "to be engaged in casual conversation," 
Cranstoun said. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders will include Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill, Anwar Sadat, 
Golda Meir, Zhou En-lai, Mao Zedong, Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. A 
computer "touchscreen" will display profile information about each leader and 
comments they made about Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other eight presidential libraries in existence, Nixon's will display 
many of the gifts he received from celebrities and world leaders. The 
collection includes a vessel with the first oil drawn from a well in Saudi 
Arabia, a set of guns from Elvis Presley and the original copy of Irving 
Berlin's "God Bless America." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitors Are Excited 
</P>
<P>
The entourage of people attending Tuesday's press tour included a few old 
friends of the former president, as well as Yorba Linda City Council members 
celebrating Nixon's birthday for the first time as a legal city holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a marvelous facility," Councilman Henry W. Wedaa, who 
first proposed the holiday last summer, said during the tour. "Look at the 
quality that is going into the construction. You don't see anything cheap going 
into this facility." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gene Wisner, who delivered welcoming remarks to the media, said he was 
surprised at how much larger the library building was than he had imagined. 
</P>
<P>
"And it's built to last 1,000 years," Wisner said. 
</P>
<P>
For Roland E. Bigonger, a Yorba Linda councilman, the library tour was a unique 
opportunity. Bigonger had been chairman of the original six-member committee 
that was formed in 1968 to preserve Nixon's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
Until the Nixon foundation was formed a few years ago, the committee raised its 
own funds to keep up the place, and its members even took it upon themselves to 
pick weeds at the old property. Now, as part of the library project, the Nixon 
foundation is spending about $400,000 to shore up the wood-frame house for 
public viewing. 
</P>
<P>
"This means the completion of a dream," Bigonger said. 
</P>
<P>
Although library designers acknowledged that the public's greatest interest no 
doubt would be in the Watergate exhibits, a longtime Nixon friend, Don 
Bendetti, 61, of Laguna Beach, said the former president distinguished himself 
in foreign policy affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"He ended the Vietnam War and he opened relations with China," said Bendetti, a 
developer who has helped oversee the library's construction. "This library will 
accentuate the good deeds and the good things he did in his Administration." 
</P>
<P>
Another Nixon friend, Jack Drown, 70, a retired magazine distributor from 
Rolling Hills, said, "I think (the library) has been a long time in coming, but 
it's going to happen and we're all excited."

BASTANCHURY ROAD GROUP SEEKS VOTE

<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton residents fighting to halt the planned widening of a one-mile stretch 
of Bastanchury Road near their homes moved Tuesday to put the issue on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Mary B. Homme, president of the Save Our Bastanchury group, submitted a 
proposed initiative to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by voters, it would require city officials to make certain that 
street improvements do not result in additional noise. 
</P>
<P>
Under state election laws, the Fullerton city attorney has until Jan. 24 to 
examine the petition and write a summary and title for it before the group can 
begin gathering signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Group members will begin circulating the petition around early February, Homme 
said. For the initiative to qualify for the November ballot, 10% of the 
registered voters in Fullerton, or about 6,000 people, must sign the petition 
within six months. 
</P>
<P>
The $3.7-million project would widen Bastanchury from four to six lanes from 
Euclid Street to Harbor Boulevard. Last year, the City Council twice voted to 
reaffirm its decision after Save Our Bastanchury members protested. 
</P>
<P>
"They say (widening is) going to decrease (noise), but they're basing it on the 
time same number of cars traveling (the wider road). My feeling is if you add 
two lanes, you're going to increase traffic, and that's what increases noise," 
Homme said. TOM McQUEENEY

DEVELOPMENT FREEZE EMBROILS COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New Mayor Christian W. Keena kicked off his term with a bang Monday as the City 
Council, meeting for the first time in 1990, wrangled furiously over a proposal 
to freeze all new development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Keena had hoped that the year's first meeting would launch a period of reduced 
tension among council members, who battled throughout 1989. But Monday's 
session dragged on until midnight, and many of the same arguments and divisions 
that surfaced last year re-emerged. 
</P>
<P>
"My brain's half dead," Keena complained as the meeting entered its fourth 
hour. "This is getting ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the council voted 5-0 to instruct the city staff to review the 
freeze proposal. First, however, the council rejected a nearly identical motion 
by a 3-2 vote, confusing some city staffers and members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Introduced by Councilman Robert A. Curtis, the proposal is modeled on emergency 
growth control measures adopted in other California cities. If approved, 
Mission Viejo's building moratorium would go into effect immediately and remain 
there at least until the city approves a general plan. 
</P>
<P>
Under the action taken Monday night, council staff will review the proposal and 
is permitted, but not required, to draft a proposed ordinance ordering a 
freeze. California law permits the imposition of emergency building moratoriums 
for no longer than four months, but they may be renewed periodically. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take a look at it, and bring something back to them in two 
weeks," City Manager Fred Sorsabal said. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, an outspoken opponent of the Mission Viejo Co., first broached the 
subject of a development freeze last year. He has argued that some sort of 
moratorium is needed to keep the company, which built the Mission Viejo planned 
community and now is wholly owned by New York-based Philip Morris Cos., from 
overdeveloping the city. 
</P>
<P>
"The most profitable use for Philip Morris may not be the best use for the 
community," Curtis said. "We need to try to preserve some hillsides and open 
space before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his council colleagues, however, said they believe it is an attempt to 
distract attention from Curtis' upcoming recall election, scheduled for Feb. 
27. Curtis denies the charge. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Viejo Co., a major financial backer of the recall, has declined to 
comment on the matter, saying that it does not want to be drawn into public 
disagreements with Curtis. But Wendy Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the company, 
downplayed the importance of the proposal, saying that "95% of our residential 
units have either been built or have already received approval." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis contends that at least 1,500 housing units -- and possibly as many as 
3,000 more -- would be affected by the moratorium, which he proposed to leave 
in effect for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
As Curtis proposed it, the moratorium affects only a few commercial properties. 
The Trabuco Hills Shopping Center, a major mall being debated, would not be 
affected. JIM NEWTON

ERROR FREES SUSPECT IN GANG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana man arrested on suspicion of intimidating witnesses to one of 
Orange County's bloodiest gang-related shootings was mistakenly released from 
jail less than 24 hours after his arrest, officials confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mistake that should not have happened," Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Avdeef 
said. "(There is) obviously no reason to release a gang member that's just been 
arrested for threatening witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Jail officials, however, said they were not at fault in releasing 
Richard (Sleepy) Ramirez Friday on his own recognizance, contending that they 
followed routine procedures. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the jail said that Ramirez, 21, was released because jail 
officials believed the charges filed against him were misdemeanors. "He 
received the same treatment as others who are cited for misdemeanors," said the 
spokesman, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
But Avdeef said the two counts of criminal conspiracy and intimidation of 
witnesses were felonies. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities became aware of Ramirez's release on Tuesday, and as of late 
Tuesday night he had not been re-arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"This should not have happened," said Isabel Rodriguez, one of the witnesses. 
"He has been a big problem for us." 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana police arrested Ramirez on Thursday after a judge issued arrest 
warrants for him and two other reputed members of the 5th Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
The three allegedly harassed witnesses to the Sept. 16 drive-by shooting on 
Bonita Avenue that left a 4-year-old boy and a 17-year-old youth dead and six 
people wounded. Police believe that members of the 5th Street gang fired the 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Police records allege that gang members issued nightly death threats against 
witnesses, tossed Molotov cocktails into their houses and attempted to run down 
a 12-year-old as he played football in the street. 
</P>
<P>
Three other reputed members of the 5th Street gang have been charged with 
murder in the drive-by slayings. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, sheriff's deputies and police sought to determine exactly how 
Ramirez came to be freed on his own recognizance. Avdeef said that jail 
officials said they released Ramirez because the officer who cited the Santa 
Ana man had written "misdemeanor" on the booking slips. 
</P>
<P>
"I told (Santa Ana police) that they better check and see who put down 
'misdemeanor,' " Avdeef said. "The police said they didn't do it because they 
were interested in keeping the guy in jail." DAVAN MAHARAJ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; 
</P>
<P>
HE'LL GO BACK TO JAIL OVER 'STUPID' LAW 
</P>

<P>
It looks like it's going to be round two in the slammer for Joseph C. Codsi. 
</P>
<P>
The Cypress man already has spent 26 days behind bars for defying court orders 
to reveal the whereabouts of his assets. But he says he'd rather be jailed 
again than pay the $17,000 in child support that he owes his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam issued a warrant for 
Codsi's arrest when he failed to appear for a hearing. Codsi had vowed Monday 
night that he would not show up, telling The Times: "I don't take orders from a 
sacred whore." He said he was referring to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Codsi, 56, said Tuesday that he knew his number was up. 
</P>
<P>
"I know they're coming to get me," he said in a telephone interview from his 
home. "I'm not scared of them. I'm waiting for them. My bags are packed." 
</P>
<P>
He might have to wait a few days. Capt. Don Spears, spokesman for the county 
marshal's office, said civil arrest warrants usually take a couple of days to 
process. 
</P>
<P>
Family law experts say Codsi's crusade is novel both for the color of his 
language and the length of time he has spent in jail. Few people stay behind 
bars so long for refusing to answer questions in a child support case. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of hearings last fall, he steadfastly refused to detail his 
finances and unleashed a stream of insults at the judge. He was held in 
contempt of court and thrown into Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
But Codsi was released Nov. 12, after 26 days, when his ex-wife's lawyer 
decided it was obvious Codsi wouldn't cooperate no matter how much time he 
spent in jail. The woman's attorneys located and seized $3,300 in a bank 
account under Codsi's name. They hoped to track down more of his money. 
</P>
<P>
But attorney Geraldine G. Sandor said Tuesday that the trail to Codsi's assets 
went cold and his ex-wife, Ruth Hill of San Clemente, cannot afford to hire a 
private investigator. So Sandor went back to court to ask for Codsi's arrest, 
hoping more time in jail might soften his outlook. 
</P>
<P>
No such luck. 
</P>
<P>
Codsi, who immigrated to the United States from his native Lebanon two decades 
ago, swore never to comply with American child support law. 
</P>
<P>
"They are legalized mobsters, the laws here," he said. "They are stupid, 
abusive and immoral. The law shouldn't intrude into my life or interfere in 
family matters. I shouldn't have to receive orders from (his ex-wife) or from 
the law on how I take care of my children." 
</P>
<P>
Codsi, a former real estate broker, said he supports his 12-year-old daughter 
and 19-year-old son "in the way I see fit: directly, independently of their 
mother. They can come to me for whatever they need." 
</P>
<P>
Codsi said the $3,300 was "the last penny I had," and that he now lives on 
money borrowed from relatives in Lebanon. He does not work "because they seize 
everything I make," Codsi said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, he is writing a book. The working title is, "The Sacrament 
of Divorce: A Field Study in the Castration of the Legal Mind." 
</P>
<P>
Sandor said Codsi's defiance leaves Hill frustrated and with few options. Her 
problem illustrates the limits of enforcement when it comes to child support 
orders, Sandor said. 
</P>
<P>
"This shows that if someone wants to thumb their nose at the system and they're 
strong enough to do it, they can," Sandor said. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

HE ERRED, KARL SAYS ON STAND

One-time video business whiz Stuart Karl, indirectly embroiled in an ongoing 
legal malpractice trial, admitted Tuesday that he made mistakes in his 
well-publicized dealings with entertainment giant Lorimar but stressed that he 
is now "trying to look forward, not back." 
</P>
<P>
In Superior Court in Fullerton, the 37-year-old Karl repeatedly had trouble 
remembering details of his business dealings, saying that some of his 
recollections were vague and that he was trying to put that chapter of his life 
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, Karl, along with plaintiffs Court Shannon and Gary Hunt, ran 
the Irvine-based Karl-Lorimar Home Video, a division of Lorimar Telepictures. 
However, all three were forced to resign when Lorimar discovered that they had 
an interest in Continental Marketing Distributors, a video supplier to 
Karl-Lorimar. 
</P>
<P>
Karl was the first witness for the defense in a legal malpractice suit filed by 
Shannon and Hunt against Newport Beach attorney Michael Genovese, who is 
accused of giving the pair bad advice that led to the loss of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Genovese denies any wrongdoing. His attorneys declined to discuss the case with 
reporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Karl had been so reluctant to discuss his involvement in the Lorimar affair 
publicly that his lawyer had earlier sought to have his testimony heard in 
secret. But Judge Kazuharu Makino rejected that move late last month, saying 
that he would not grant Karl "a private court." 
</P>
<P>
While seeking to justify his past business practices, Karl also said he takes 
responsibility for his decision not to disclose to his bosses at Lorimar his 
financial stake in a Lorimar supplier. He resigned in March, 1987, amid charges 
that the arrangement amounted to a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I made the mistake. I didn't listen to . . . advice," Karl said at one point 
during his more than three hours on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
Karl said that it was never his intention to hide his financial stake in the 
Torrance- based CMD from the Lorimar board of directors. Rather, he simply 
decided not to deal with the matter until CMD gained more clients. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I avoided what I should do and go to the board," he said. "I just put 
it off." 
</P>
<P>
He took this action against the advice of Genovese, who as Karl's attorney 
advised his client to approach Lorimar with the issue, Karl testified. 
</P>
<P>
However, Karl defended the legitimacy of the arrangement between Karl-Lorimar 
and CMD, saying that he believed the deal was honest because outside bids were 
taken before awarding contracts to CMD and because he was kept at "arms length" 
from the process. 
</P>
<P>
Karl continually stressed that positive thinking and a good attitude got him 
through his troubled times, which included an admission that he made illegal 
campaign contributions to former presidential candidate Gary Hart and his 
filing for bankruptcy protection against about $4 million in delinquent taxes. 
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of his testimony, Karl revealed that he underwent cancer 
surgery six months ago. Bonnie Brown, an attorney of the plaintiffs, said he 
had skin cancer. Karl and his attorney declined to discuss any aspects of his 
day in court.

AUTOPSY BLAMES CHOKE-HOLD FOR CONCERT-GOER'S DEATH; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: IN CONTRAST TO INGLEWOOD POLICE VERSION, REPORT SAYS FOUNTAIN 
VALLEY MAN'S BODY SHOWED "CONSIDERABLE BRUISING." DRUG USE IS ALSO INDICATED.

An autopsy on a Fountain Valley man who died in the custody of Inglewood police 
after a Grateful Dead concert last month confirms that he died from a carotid 
choke-hold and that his body was covered with bruises, a coroner's office 
spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to an initial police report, the autopsy on 19-year-old 
Patrick Shanahan describes "considerable bruising" on Shanahan's forehead, 
neck, scalp, cheek, jaw, shoulder, chest, ribs and knee, said spokesman Bob 
Dambacher. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy report was released this week by the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The bruises on Shanahan's back were as much as an inch deep and were so 
prevalent that they could not be individually distinguished, Deputy Medical 
Examiner Irwin L. Golden wrote in the 25-page report. 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan, a student at UC Santa Barbara and an avid Grateful Dead fan, died 
Dec. 10 shortly after being arrested by five officers outside the Forum on 
suspicion of being under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Trygstad, a Los Angeles lawyer retained by the Shanahan family, said 
the autopsy "further substantiates the excessive force and the brutality that 
(officers) used. With the autopsy report, the witnesses and everything else, 
there's no question the officers used excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
The family's lawyer said the autopsy affirms witness accounts that Shanahan was 
repeatedly beaten by police with night sticks. 
</P>
<P>
William Shanahan, assessing the autopsy report, said that his son "was a mess 
from head to toe. The police version of events doesn't gibe." 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that an officer applied a carotid choke-hold on Shanahan to 
control him, Inglewood police denied witnesses' claims that officers beat 
Shanahan with their batons and maintained that officers had to use force to 
control the combative Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
"If you as a police officer are engaged in a fight or wild confrontation with a 
person on LSD, to what extent can you protect yourself from a person almost 
impervious to pain?" Moret asked. He described the choke-hold as an "approved 
method of dealing with extremely dangerous and combative people." 
</P>
<P>
Moret also raised the possibility that some of the bruises could have been 
self-induced before police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Investigations by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office and 
Inglewood Police Department are ongoing, spokesmen said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Inglewood probe is being hampered because witnesses of the arrest have been 
contacting the family's attorney but not the police, Moret said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LSD Use Cited 
</P>
<P>
Dambacher said the autopsy shows that a carotid choke-hold applied by officers 
is the primary cause Shanahan's death. "There are neck injuries on either side 
of the center of the neck and in the jaw area," he said. "It looks like it was 
a carotid hold that compressed the neck." 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy also agrees with a preliminary post-mortem report released last 
month that said LSD intoxication and multiple injuries were contributing causes 
to his death. 
</P>
<P>
William Shanahan said he was not surprised by the autopsy because the funeral 
director who prepared the body had advised him not to view it. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be real difficult reading," Shanahan said of the autopsy, "but I plan 
to read through it page by page." 
</P>
<P>
Shanahan and Trygstad said internal police documents have downplayed the 
injuries Shanahan suffered. 
</P>
<P>
A police report of Shanahan's death says a doctor at Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital, where Shanahan was taken in the back of a police car, reported little 
trauma other than some marking on his wrists. The report added that 
investigating officers who observed the body the next day reported only "a 
small contusion on his chin and a small contusion on the left side of his 
forehead." 
</P>
<P>
The report added: "The investigating officers observed no other signs of 
trauma." 
</P>
<P>
However, the autopsy detailed "multiple blunt force traumatic injuries, both 
external and internal." They included bruises around both eyes, bruises on the 
rib cage, back and chest, a 2 1/2-inch abrasion on the left cheek, cuts and 
bruises to both wrists and external discoloration and internal hemorrhaging in 
the neck. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy results will now go to Dr. Irving Root, a private pathologist hired 
by the Shanahan family. Root said his results should be compiled within two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the affect of LSD on an individual, Root said the 
hallucinogenic drug has never killed anyone by itself but can change behavior 
"in very peculiar and unusual ways." 
</P>
<P>
"They can get very excitable, violent or very quiet," Root said. "The whole 
gamut."

BENNETT AIDE IN O.C. ASSAILS DRUG-LEGALIZATION EFFORT; 
</P>
<P>
NARCOTICS: THE NATIONAL POLICY DIRECTOR'S AIDE SAYS MAKING STREET DRUGS LEGAL 
WOULD SOLVE NOTHING AND COST AMERICANS DEARLY.

<P>
With a "Drug Use Is Life Abuse" pin in his lapel, a top aide to national drug 
policy director William J. Bennett on Tuesday criticized the growing 
drug-legalization movement as a misguided effort that would increase human 
suffering and cost the nation billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"What are you going to do, legalize PCP and crack?" Judge Reggie B. Walton 
asked a luncheon gathering at UC Irvine. "Look at what happened in Washington, 
D.C., where 13 men assaulted and (sodomized) a woman while high on PCP and 
where another woman on crack took a ligature and strangled two children. How do 
we legalize stuff like that?" 
</P>
<P>
Walton, assistant director of the White House Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, also gave no assurances to Sheriff Brad Gates that Orange County would 
be included in a new program for the nation's worst drug-infested areas. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has decided to declare at least four regions of the country as 
"high-intensity drug trafficking areas," which will qualify them for increased 
federal assistance in the so-called war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Areas so designated will be disclosed at month's end, when the President's 
budget is announced. Part, if not all, of Southern California is very likely to 
be among the regions selected for additional law enforcement funds, government 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Walton, 40, a point man for Bennett's effort to develop and implement a 
national drug strategy, came to Orange County to meet with public officials and 
peruse county programs for ideas to be incorporated into the Bush 
Administration's anti-drug effort. 
</P>
<P>
The former Superior Court judge from Washington said he was particularly 
encouraged by a host of alliances formed by county law enforcement, business, 
local government, and educators to combat drug and alcohol addiction through 
education and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Walton met with the County Board of Supervisors, UC Irvine 
educators and members of the Orange County Substance Abuse Prevention 
Partnership, a coalition of cities, county drug officials, school districts, 
and UCI; and the Drug Use Is Life Abuse program that involves local business 
and industry. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some real problems -- drug sales by undocumented immigrants and jail 
and prison overcrowding," Walton said, "but there are some areas I am impressed 
with. They are getting the message out that drug use is a problem here." 
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Walton leveled his harshest words at a small but growing 
effort to legalize drugs and eliminate law enforcement problems associated with 
narcotics. Proponents include nationally renowned economist Milton Friedman, 
former Secretary of State George P. Schultz and conservative commentator 
William F. Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
Walton said that drugs, if legalized, would become as great a problem as 
alcohol and cigarettes, which harm and kill far more people annually than 
addiction to illegal street drugs. Government figures show that alcohol alone 
costs the nation $118 billion a year in health costs, accidents and law 
enforcement problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Unlike drinking, drug use will never be socially acceptable," Walton said. "At 
the dinner table, you can't light up your crack pipe. There are no crack 
cocktails. People will still get drugs on the black market so they won't be 
identified as a drug user." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Walton's morning was spent in cordial give-and-take discussions about 
federal drug policy. But he took some heat from Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, 
who questioned whether the war on drugs was well-coordinated and wished him, 
"Good luck." 
</P>
<P>
Her colleague, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, confronted Walton with a National 
League of Cities report critical of the Bush Administration. The report found 
an increase in crime in areas where drug supplies have been cut and concluded 
that the President's policy makers have not informed cities how to deal with 
that increase. Walton responded that the criticism was from politicians who 
"wanted the problems solved overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Superior Court Judge David Carter requested that the U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service play more of a role in relieving jail 
overcrowding by deporting illegal immigrants convicted of drug offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Walton declined to comment on whether Orange County will be declared a 
"high-intensity drug trafficking area," except to say the designation will be 
based on regional, not municipal, boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, who met with Walton for two hours, said he received no assurances from 
the judge after trying to impress on him the need for such a designation for 
Orange County, now identified as a major transportation hub for drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave him a real good understanding of what is going on," Gates said as 
Walton boarded a plane at John Wayne Airport. "We are not much different than 
Los Angeles, San Diego, San Bernardino. We are all under the same gun."

STATE COMMISSION APPROVES FINE OF $4,000 FOR CAMPBELL

<P>
The Fair Political Practices Commission voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to approve a 
previously reported agreement under which former state Sen. William Campbell 
(R-Hacienda Heights) will pay a $4,000 fine for failing to report $30,700 in 
late campaign contributions to his 1986 state controller's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell retired from the Senate last month and is now president of the 
California Manufacturers Assn., a powerful trade and lobby group. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement does not affect other ongoing FPPC investigations into 
allegations that Campbell and his top aide, Jerome M. Haleva, failed to report 
a gift and that Haleva failed to report as a gift a below-market interest rate 
he received on a $20,000 personal loan.

SHE DISCOVERS RECORDS ARE MADE TO BE CONFUSING

In fairy tales, some prince is always inheriting some throne or kingdom, only 
to have a brother emerge as the rightful heir. 
</P>
<P>
High school basketball records can be a lot like that. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Debbie Fischer of Edison High School. Fischer apparently set a 
Southern Section record for making the most three-point baskets in a game. In a 
Dec. 14 victory over Corona, Fischer sank 10 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section lists Marilyn Robinson of Pasadena and Chiemi Morita of 
Hacienda Heights Wilson as sharing the record with eight three-pointers. But 
that was only the reported record. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Lizarraga, now at UC Irvine, apparently set a section and state record 
last season with 12 three-pointers when she scored 46 points for Calexico in a 
61-48 victory over Fallbrook, according to Mark Tennis of Cal-Hi Sports 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis said he established the record from a report of the game in the San 
Diego Union, which reported that Lizarraga was 12 of 15 from the floor and had 
made 12 three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Cal-Hi is a weekly magazine that compiles state rankings, statistical leaders 
and records for high school sports. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you're dealing with boys' and girls' records and dealing with 
hundreds of schools and thousands of games, there are going to be slip-ups," 
Tennis said. "That is why we always say it is a reported record because there 
is always a chance, however slim, that there is an unreported total out there." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis said the reason his magazine and many of the CIF sections have different 
records is because he will take newspaper accounts as proof of a performance. 
The CIF sections often depend on written notice from the schools. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section asks its members to return a form listing record-setting 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 475 member schools in our section and geographically we range from the 
Mexican border to Paso Robles," said Scott Cathcart, a Southern Section 
spokesman. "It is impossible for us to keep track of everything that happens, 
so we ask our schools to provide us with that information. 
</P>
<P>
"I still haven't been contacted by the school concerning (Lizarraga's record). 
I don't doubt that she did it or anything but that is how our process works."

SHOOTING THE THREE IS NO LONGER A SHOT IN THE DARK; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION IN 1987, THE THREE-POINT BASKET HAS BECOME 
AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE GIRLS' GAME.

<P>
One of the basics of basketball is the triple-threat position. That's a 
position from which an athlete is a threat to pass, drive or shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Now the game has a new triple threat -- the three-point shot. And it finally 
seems to have come of age in girls' basketball. 
</P>
<P>
When the 19-foot 9-inch arc was introduced three years ago it skipped by like a 
pebble, making only a ripple in girls' basketball waters. But this season the 
three-point shot has made quite a splash as Orange County girls, such as Debbie 
Fischer of Edison High, get comfortable with shooting from behind the 
three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer set a reported Southern Section record hitting 10 three-point shots in 
a Dec. 14 victory over Corona del Mar in the Savanna Tournament. She leads a 
handful of girls who have emerged as regular three-point shooters. Girls such 
as Marina's Melisa Sortino, Brea-Olinda's Aimee McDaniel and Santa Margarita's 
Kristen Mulligan, all of whom have had seven in a game, Rancho Alamitos' 
Shellie Tsuji, who hit four in one quarter, and many others who have converted 
the shot from a desperation fling attempted at the end of a quarter to an 
integral part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
As more and more coaches realize the three-point shot's potential to create 
sudden swings in game momentum, they are incorporating it into their practices. 
And as more girls practice the shot, they have begun to overcome mental 
obstacles and myths about not being strong enough to shoot the three. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro Coach Greg Yeck has taken a 180-degree turn on his three-point shot 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed to me when it first came out that everybody was saying it was no big 
deal," Yeck said. "It was not going to affect the girls' game that much because 
who is going to be shooting it? It might be one of those things when somebody 
puts up a desperation shot at the end of a half. And you had to be conscious of 
it because it could beat you, but as far as it becoming a regular part of the 
game plan, I don't think coaches were thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
"To tell the truth, that was my attitude too. I said I'm not going to worry 
about it too much. I don't want the kids thinking about it. . . . Now I think 
if they have the ability, let them do it." 
</P>
<P>
Yeck's attitude has changed partly because he has some players who can shoot 
the three-pointer. The first year the rule was introduced Yeck had center 
Elaine Youngs, now playing basketball and volleyball at UCLA, who had enough 
power to pull up and take a jump shot from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just something she could do at the end of a ballgame if we needed it, 
that kind of thing, but we weren't really looking for it," Yeck said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year El Toro's Kristen Bevis took about three or four shots from 
three-point range each game; this season Yeck has four players who have been 
given the green light to shoot the three. 
</P>
<P>
Yeck also has incorporated three-point drills during practice for the four. And 
his players practiced the three-point shot a lot over the summer. Point guard 
Yoshioka leads the way, shooting 19 of 38 for 50% in preleague play. But it is 
teammate Tracy Heiser who has had the biggest three-point basket for the 
Chargers this season. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend Fischer and Edison had the tables turned on them when Heiser's 
three-point shot with nine seconds to play tied the game and sent it into 
overtime. Yoshioka sank another three in the extra period and El Toro 
eventually won, 63-59, ending Edison's eight-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Heiser, who made 14 of 38 three-point shots in preleague play, doesn't remember 
taking one three-point shot last year. Like many girls, she had to be persuaded 
to shoot from 19-9. But once they get started, they have been hard to stop. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time my coach said shoot a three I said, 'You're kidding,' " Heiser 
said. "I would stand behind the line and look at the basket and think, 'That is 
so far away. I am never going to be able to do this.' But we just kept shooting 
them and shooting them and it felt like I was throwing it up less and less." 
</P>
<P>
First-year Coach Philip Abraham has designed Edison's offense around getting 
Fischer open around the three-point line. "A lot of it is mental," Abraham 
said. "If you take away that line, you are going to find a lot of girls who can 
shoot it from out there. The fact that the line is there, it puts up the mental 
barrier. It gets girls asking 'Am I a three-point shooter or am I not a 
three-point shooter?' It is not a terribly far shot and again the smaller ball 
really aids the girls in getting it there." 
</P>
<P>
Because of some reluctance on her part and a conservative coaching philosophy, 
Fischer attempted only 11 three-point shots last season. This season, she has 
made 61 of 147 under Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
The new strategy is paying off for Edison, which doesn't have a starter taller 
than 5-10. After starting the season unranked, the Chargers won 11 of their 
first 14 games and are now ranked fourth in 4-AA. With the three-point shot as 
the cornerstone of their offense, they have upset ranked teams that have much 
taller and more talented players. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers surprised Ocean View, with 6-2 center Jenny Sullivan, the Sunset 
League most valuable player, in the championship of the Marina Tournament. In 
the same tournament, Edison beat Mission Viejo and 6-2 center Jennifer Rohrig, 
and Lakewood, which has three 6-foot post players. 
</P>
<P>
"You know me, I believe in the three-point shot all the way," Abraham said. "It 
forces teams to play defense. They can't stand around in a zone like most high 
school girls do. It lets you use the whole halfcourt and pulls teams out away 
from the basket." 
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Pete Bonny, who coaches Sortino, agrees. He had his junior varsity 
girls taking three-point shots regularly last year at Newport Harbor. The team 
set a junior varsity girls' basketball record at the school with the most 
victories in a season, 10. 
</P>
<P>
"When I coached JV nobody could shoot the three, but teams would be so stunned 
when one went in that we kept trying them," Bonny said. "The big thing is, who 
cares if you miss? The rebounds are all long, they go to you. We fired a ton 
when I coached over at Newport. Maybe one of six would go in, but it worked 
well for us. You get the caroms if you don't get it in and if you make it, the 
other team starts shaking their heads." 
</P>
<P>
Long rebounds are just what a short team such as Edison needs. Abraham is so 
sold on the shot that he says "if you're going to give a player three points 
for making the shot, (the player) should get three foul shots if she's fouled 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
Edison's Fischer already has set one three-point record in the Southern Section 
and is on the brink of breaking another. Her 61 three-point baskets this season 
is five short of the Southern Section single-season record of 66 set by Linda 
Watson of Lynwood last season. 
</P>
<P>
She is one of several girls who dispel the myth that girls aren't strong enough 
to shoot three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Not many of the girls have the strength to shoot a pure jump shot from 19-9. 
What they shoot is a modified jump shot or a set shot. 
</P>
<P>
Rancho Alamitos' Tsuji is only 5-2 and about 100 pounds, Yoshioka is only 5-4 
and they both shoot the set shot. Fischer shoots a modified jump shot. She 
steps forward and her motion begins at about her waist so she can generate 
extra lift. 
</P>
<P>
Des Flood of Anaheim, who runs shooting camps for boys and girls, says the key 
to the three is not arm strength. It is wrist strength, and girls have enough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a myth that girls are not strong enough to shoot 
three-pointers," Flood said. "The wrist is a very strong part of any human 
being's body. The girls just haven't learned the technique to be able to 
deliver the ball. Their technique might not be perfectly correct but that they 
are making it would indicate that they are strong enough to get the ball 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Whiting, a professor of sport biomechanics in UCLA's kinesiology 
department, agrees. Williams coaches boys' basketball at Eagle Rock High School 
and has worked with girls on their shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Mechanically the shot is a combination of horizontal and vertical forces," 
Whiting said, "and the difference is in how the boys in general versus girls in 
general generate the shot. Boys tend to get lift for vertical forces by way of 
their jump. Girls, instead of jumping vertically, they tend to take one step 
forward and bend their knees, then extend the knees with their feet in a 
forward-back position to get lift. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to get the forward-back difference they have to start behind the line 
so that when they take that step forward they are still behind the line." 
</P>
<P>
That is one reason players such as Fischer regularly shoot from well behind the 
three-point line. 
</P>
<P>
Sortino of Marina also practices from about 23 feet. She does that so she can 
get her low-release shot off without defenders blocking it. 
</P>
<P>
"She is shooting right above the shoulders, so we are talking upper chest," 
Marina Coach Bonny said. "There is no way she's going to get it up over her 
head on those super long shots. She's just not physically strong enough. She's 
on a weight program and everything, but that's just a physical limitation." 
Sortino, who will play at the University of San Diego next season, hit 44 of 90 
in preleague play this season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I shoot my three-pointer I concentrate on using more leg, and when I'm in 
closer I don't have to use as much leg," Sortino said. "Last year I only had 13 
total. I didn't ever look for it and didn't really practice it either. The only 
time I took it was when we needed it, now I look for it in the middle of the 
game, even when we don't need it." 
</P>
<P>
Fischer and many of the girls have given up a bit of form to be able to launch 
a shot from 19-9, but the more they practice the more consistent they become. 
</P>
<P>
"When we give a clinic we always stress to the players that they should volume 
shoot," Flood said. "A player who doesn't have good technique and goes out and 
shoots 500 shots a day will increase his accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
As girls get better coaching earlier in their careers, experts say, their 
three-point shooting will improve. 
</P>
<P>
"It is partly a developmental factor," said Whiting of UCLA. "You will see 
young kids shooting with a regulation ball at a 10-foot basket, you will see 
them shooting off their hip because they are not strong enough to get it off 
the regular way. Boys, by the time they get into eighth or ninth grade, have 
the strength to convert over to a more regular jump shot and raise the release 
point (above the head). With girls, in general, they don't start playing as 
early, so developmentally they are a bit behind with their skills. If you gave 
them the same exposure to shooting technique and skills I think they could be 
trained to shoot three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
"Already in the past five years there had been a rapid improvement in 
basketball skills for girls. I can remember five years ago watching a girls' 
basketball game and there would be 57 jump balls, it was a joke." 
</P>
<P>
The laughter is dying down on the third anniversary of the three-point shot as 
more and more girls become triple threats.

SWISS WATCH'S PRICE COULD STOP A CLOCK; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: PROSPECTIVE BUYERS ARE LINING UP FOR A LOOK AT DESIGNER GERALD 
GENTA'S $250,000 TIMEPIECE. PROMOTERS SAY IT'S FOR THOSE WHO WANT THE BEST IN 
PRE-HIGH-TECH ARTISTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time is money. But the bill usually doesn't run this high. 
</P>
<P>
The famed Swiss designer Gerald Genta is coming out with a new wristwatch that, 
more or less like an ordinary Swatch, tells time. Only it costs about $249,965 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Who in the world would want to buy a timepiece costing a quarter of a million 
dollars, even if it is an extremely rare and fancy Tourbillon Minute Repeater? 
"Someone who just doesn't want to be a me-too person and can afford it," said 
Stuart Barish, vice president of the New York distributor, Gerald Genta North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"There's arrogance involved," he added, "but it's also ego and pride, so why 
not?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, aside from world poverty and other possible reasons, the band is simply 
leather, and the watch itself, unlike most in this price range, isn't studded 
with precious gems. It isn't even watertight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you'd want to go swimming with it," Barish said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, you could buy a Volvo for what you'd save in New York city and state 
sales taxes alone by doing without the Genta creation. 
</P>
<P>
But none of that seems to have dampened interest in the watch, which is being 
touted as the most expensive "pure" watch -- in other words, one that isn't 
intended as jewelry -- ever made. Already, people are lining up to buy the 
first one, which is due to arrive in this country early next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The piece probably will be sold before it even gets in a case. We have a dozen 
prospects waiting to hold it in their hands," said Anthony D'Ambrosio, 
executive director of Tourneau, the New York dealer that has the right to sell 
the first Tourbillon Minute Repeater. 
</P>
<P>
"A quarter-million for a watch makes more sense to me than a $50-million 
painting," he added, when asked to explain why someone would want to spend 
$250,000 on a timepiece. If you use the watch for one year, that would be a 
little less than a penny a tick. 
</P>
<P>
The Swiss-made watches will be cranked out at the rate of two or so a year, and 
sometime in 1990 the Princess Ermine Jewels shop at the Beverly Hilton might 
have one to sell too. 
</P>
<P>
For the money, the buyer will get some special features. Made of more than 600 
parts, it can be set to chime every minute, every 15 minutes or at nearly any 
other interval. 
</P>
<P>
The watch also offers a perpetual calendar, meaning that it makes automatic 
adjustments for months of varying lengths. In fact, one lever kicks in just 
once every four years, when Feb. 29 arrives on leap year. 
</P>
<P>
"It just works with gears and levers, the old-fashioned way," D'Ambrosio said. 
</P>
<P>
The device also is noted for its "skeleton" housing, which lets you see the 
parts inside. 
</P>
<P>
Genta, the designer, is part of the attraction too. "He works on the watch by 
hand and mind," Barish said. 
</P>
<P>
Genta is "the Picasso of watches," Barish boasted. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, promoters say the watch should appeal to the wealthy collector who 
admires the best in pre-high-tech craftsmanship and artistry. 
</P>
<P>
The psychology of the buyer figures into the equation, too. David Stewart, a 
social psychologist who is a marketing professor at USC, said there always will 
be a market for ultra-expensive products as long as there are newly rich people 
"who are insecure in their new status in life and need the symbols of that 
status as a way of dealing with their insecurity."

<TEXT>
<P>
Colombo Port, traditionally one of the busiest in South Asia, is again buzzing 
with activity after having been paralyzed this summer by rebel-inspired 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are pressing ahead with ambitious expansion plans and cutting the 
fees they charge shippers to revitalize the port and support Sri Lanka's 
war-ravaged economy. 
</P>
<P>
But shipping analysts worry that the government's efforts may not be enough to 
reassure merchants, who prefer to do business in calmer places. 
</P>
<P>
The port was crippled from June to August, as workers obeyed a strike call by 
the People's Liberation Front. In that period, many foreign ships bypassed 
Colombo, and export shipments vital to Sri Lanka's economy were delayed. 
</P>
<P>
But the strikes petered out by September, and port work has returned to normal, 
said Vas Gunawardene, chairman of the Ports Authority. 
</P>
<P>
He said two new shipping lines plying through Colombo, coupled with Sri Lanka's 
deregulation of export shipments, should boost the port's business. 
</P>
<P>
Gunawardene also said he had traveled overseas recently to reassure clients 
that the port facilities are reliable. His job was made difficult by the 
escalating political violence in Sri Lanka that has claimed the lives of 
foreign business people as well as hundreds of Sri Lankans. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from its conflicts with the People's Liberation Front, the government is 
locked in a fierce struggle with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam for 
control of Tamil-dominated areas of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"There were many apprehensions about the situation here," Gunawardene said. 
"Shipping companies were worried about the continuity of stability. I was able 
to allay their fears." 
</P>
<P>
Gunawardene predicted Colombo's cargo handling would fall by 8,000 containers 
this year, from the 1988 figure of 638,000. But he said volume would pick up in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Business next year is expected to improve, and in the year 2000 we are aiming 
for 1.4 million containers." 
</P>
<P>
He added that a third container berth would be built in Colombo by 1992 to 
increase capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Ellawala, chairman of the private Sri Lanka Shippers Council, added that 
the port's activities were expected to increase because the government 
announced Dec. 1 that Sri Lankan exporters can use any shipping line. 
</P>
<P>
Exporters had previously been compelled to give preference to the state-owned 
Ceylon Shipping Corp., a policy criticized by foreign shipping lines. 
</P>
<P>
Port officials said Contiship, which runs a world service through New Zealand 
and Australia, began using Colombo's port last month. They said the Soviet 
Union's Blacksea Shipping Co., which carries tea and rubber, would start 
operating here this month. 
</P>
<P>
Gunawardene also said various port charges were cut by 50% this month to 
attract more ships. 
</P>
<P>
However, shipping analysts said that the port remains vulnerable to rebel 
strikes and that the government's forecasts of rising business may be too 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials said rebel activity has diminished since the leader of the 
People's Liberation Front, Rohana Wijeweera, was killed here Nov. 13. But the 
fighting continues. 
</P>
<P>
One shipping expert, who declined to be identified, said: "For the moment, the 
port is working OK. But if strikes occur once again, Colombo would have a more 
difficult time retaining its image as an efficient and productive port." 
</P>
<P>
Mahinda Ratnayake, general manager of Ceylon Shipping Lines, said the volume of 
export cargo is unlikely to increase in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"More ships could come, but they will share the same cake," he said, adding 
that export tonnage had been flat in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
Colombo's port was dealt a heavy blow when the American President Lines shifted 
its trans-shipment center from Colombo to Fujirah in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a large slice of the business: 80,000 containers a year," Gunawardene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ratnayake, whose Ceylon Shipping Lines is APL's local agent, said the APL 
pulled out because of the labor unrest in Colombo Port and because Fujirah had 
other cost advantages.

Business Loans: Liberty National Bank in Huntington Beach was the nation's 
10th-largest provider of business loans backed by the Small Business 
Administration during the government's fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
The small bank, with assets of $132.6 million, provided $24.5 million in 
SBA-guaranteed loans to small companies. 
</P>
<P>
Providing loans to small business helps them grow, creates new jobs, increases 
the general tax base and helps firms bring their products and services to the 
marketplace, said Liberty President Philip S. Inglee. 
</P>

"It's taken us seven years to reach the top 10," he said. "We've been slowly

Fire Loss -- Insurance covered the majority of costs resulting from a 1985 fire

A Friday article on conservation of fire-damaged art erroneously reported that 
about half of the Huntington's $1-million bill for cleanup and renovation was 
paid by government grants and that private donations covered the rest. In fact, 
the Huntington received an emergency grant of $30,000 from the National 
Endowment for the Humanities and a grant of $17,500 from the National Endowment 
for the Arts. Individuals, foundations and corporations contributed an 
additional $72,000. Insurance covered damage to the building.

SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS 4 YONKERS CONTEMPT FINES 
</P>

<P>
A sharply divided Supreme Court today overturned contempt fines imposed against 
four Yonkers, N.Y., city councilmen who defied a federal judge's order to adopt 
a housing desegregation plan. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the court said the judge who imposed the fines exceeded his 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting justices said today's ruling, which follows a series of decisions 
last year that generally narrowed the scope of civil rights laws, could 
hamstring judges in dealing with officials who defy anti-discrimination court 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said U.S. District 
Judge Leonard Sand acted too hastily in holding the councilmen in contempt. 
</P>
<P>
The judge should have waited to see whether a contempt order against the city 
that threatened to bankrupt it succeeded in forcing compliance with Sand's 
desegregation order, Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
Only if that failed, the chief justice said, should contempt sanctions against 
the individual council members even have been considered. 
</P>
<P>
"The imposition of sanctions on individual legislators is designed to cause 
them to vote, not with a view to the interest of their constituents or of the 
city, but with a view solely to their own personal interests," Rehnquist said. 
"This sort of individual sanction effects a much greater perversion of the 
normal legislative process than does the imposition of sanctions on the city." 
</P>
<P>
Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said the ruling may 
intimidate judges and give public officials more reason to defy reasonable 
court orders. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry that the court's message will have the unintended effect of 
emboldening recalcitrant officials continually to test the ultimate reach of 
the remedial authority of the federal courts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The end result could be the delaying of civil rights progress, Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul 
Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
The Yonkers case attracted national attention in the summer of 1988 as the 
defiant councilmen were threatened with jail as well as fines, and the city 
faced possible bankruptcy for refusing to obey Sand's orders. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with massive layoffs of city workers, the City Council reversed itself 
and on Sept. 10, 1988, voted to comply with Sand's order to build 1,000 
low-cost homes to desegregate middle-class areas of the city just north of New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
But Yonkers still had to pay $819,000 in fines and the four councilmen $3,500 
apiece for being in contempt of the judge's order from the previous Aug. 2.

BLAST SHUTS DOWN SOLAR PLANT

<P>
An explosion and fire shut down electricity production at the world's largest 
solar power plant in the Mojave Desert near Barstow this morning. 
</P>
<P>
One of four natural-gas-fired heaters used as a backup system at the Harper 
Lake solar plant exploded as it was being brought up to full power. The cause 
of the explosion was unknown. No one was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
The $230-million, 80-megawatt plant operated by Luz International Ltd. of Los 
Angeles was put on line Dec. 28 and provides enough electricity to serve 
115,000 people. The power is sold to Southern California Edison Co. An Edison 
spokesman said there was no interruption of electricity service to its 
customers.

The Los Angeles Coliseum Commission voted 8 to 0 today to support the concept 
of demolishing and reconstructing the Coliseum as a means of either keeping the 
Raiders football team or attracting a new professional team. 
</P>
<P>
The only commission member who is opposed to the idea, Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Pete Schabarum, left the meeting before the vote for another 
engagement. The decision cleared the way for the stadium's private managers, 
Spectacor Management Group and MCA, Inc., to proceed with negotiations with 
Raiders owner Al Davis in hopes of reaching an agreement to keep the team in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The motion offered by commission member Matthew Grossman stipulated that 
reconstructing the Coliseum and keeping professional football would "be 
achieved without expense to the public or any liability or commitment of public 
funds on the part of the commission." 
</P>
<P>
The motion also said the commission supports "the concept of privatizing the 
management and operation of the Coliseum," an apparent commitment to approving 
a long-term lease of the facility to the private partners. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reference to attracting a new team if the Raiders leave Los 
Angeles, it is unlikely the project could secure financing without a 
professional team already here. 
</P>
<P>
Following the vote, Irving Azoff, a spokesman for the private management team, 
said Spectacor and MCA, joined by the Pritzker hotel interests, already have a 
firm offer on Davis' desk and Azoff said he hopes for its quick acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' office said the owner was out of town and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In past statements, Davis has said he wants a more "intimate" stadium to play 
football in than the present 92,000-seat Coliseum. He has been pursuing that 
goal in negotiations the last two years in Irwindale, Oakland and Sacramento as 
well as Los Angeles. Just last Friday, he was in Sacramento meeting with those 
who have proposed building a stadium there, and this Friday, he is due in 
Oakland to meet with promoters there. 
</P>
<P>
The latest Los Angeles offer from the private firms would entail demolishing 
the Coliseum except for its eastern peristyle end and building a $140-million 
facility with about 70,000 seats, including 200 luxury boxes and several 
thousand club seats. In addition, the Raiders would be paid sums estimated at 
today's meeting at up to $40 million cash at the outset, as well as $56 million 
in cash guaranteed for later. 
</P>
<P>
The commission vote, coming after brief debate, is only one in a series of 
steps necessary to bring such a deal into being. 
</P>
<P>
If Davis approves, the commission would have to approve the exact details, new 
leases of the Coliseum grounds would have to be negotiated, historic 
preservation and environmental requirements met, and financing secured. Also, 
the joint powers agreement under which the Coliseum is run by a tripartite body 
composed of representatives of the city, county and state may have to be 
revised. 
</P>
<P>
Looking toward dealing with all these details, commissioner president Richard 
Riordan appointed a committee composed of himself, Schabarum and Grossman, to 
talk matters over with the private managers.

Former East German leader Erich Honecker underwent a successful operation for a 
malignant kidney tumor today, the official East German news agency ADN 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors had said Honecker, under investigation on charges of profiteering and 
abuses of power during his 18 years as East Germany's hard-line Communist 
leader, had been too ill to be jailed and he was released from house arrest 
last week. It was not immediately clear whether Honecker, 77, would be jailed 
after his recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
ADN, quoting a Health Ministry spokesman, said, "The tumor was radically 
removed. The operation was carried out successfully."

<P>
The high-living daughter of Romania's executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu had a 
long line of lovers, was a seasoned traveler and almost permanently drunk, a 
Bucharest newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever she ran away from home, her mother, Elena, ordered a nationwide search 
mobilizing militia and secret police to hunt her down, the independent daily, 
Tineretul Liber (Free Youth) said. 
</P>
<P>
Zoia Ceausescu, said to be in her late 30s, was arrested hours before her 
parents were executed by an army firing squad on Christmas Day after a military 
court found them guilty of genocide. 
</P>
<P>
Zoia and her playboy brother, Nicu, are in detention awaiting trial. No trace 
has been found of their adopted brother, Valentin. 
</P>
<P>
Zoia fell in love very easily and her escorts ranged from ministers to barmen, 
the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
"When she saw a handsome man she wouldn't let him go until she had hooked him." 
</P>
<P>
Zoia, who, the paper said, had twice undergone treatment at drying-out clinics, 
would drink her lovers under the table and would kick them out of her room if 
they were later too drunk to respond to her advances. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Zoia was a "nymphomaniac" who courted ex-convicts who were 
quickly propelled to top positions in industry if "she considered them to be 
good lovers." 
</P>
<P>
But she was easily angered by overbearing Securitate men who would suddenly 
find themselves exiled to a job in a remote part of Romania on her say-so. 
</P>
<P>
Her large private apartment near Ceausescu's lavish Bucharest residence, the 
Primaverii Palace, contained a massive bar stocked with whiskey, gin and 
Cinzano that was regularly replenished. 
</P>
<P>
The article said "the princess" bore all the signs of her high living -- sunken 
cheeks, wrinkles and dark rings around the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever she tired of life in Bucharest, Zoia would give her bodyguards the 
slip and run away with one of her boyfriends, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
Zoia, supposedly head of the mathematics department of a technical institute, 
was hardly ever in Bucharest, Tineretul Liber said. She would travel to Paris 
or Madrid "not to visit the Louvre or the Prado museum but to enjoy the finer 
things of life."

Documents giving details of torture, executions and mass graves in Iran were 
presented today by Iranian resistance officials to the head of a U.N. 
investigation into human rights violations in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
The eight documents named 653 prisons and "torture centers" in Iran and the 
identities of 1,786 persons accused by the resistance of being torturers. They 
gave the locations of 30 mass graves around Tehran and reprinted official 
Iranian reports on the execution of 1,200 prisoners in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Kazem Radjavi, a representative of the National Council of the Iranian 
Resistance, said the execution of political prisoners is often "camouflaged" by 
calling them drug traffickers to avoid foreign condemnation.

Floodwaters up to 4 feet deep breached a dike today and combined with mudslides 
to force hundreds from their homes in Washington. Oregon's governor declared 
emergencies in two counties where roads were under 6 feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
"The dike has been breached and they couldn't hold it back with sandbags," Fire 
Chief Chuck Newbury said in Centralia, Wash., where the Skookumchuck River 
overflowed. 
</P>
<P>
In southern Washington, Interstate 5, the region's major north-south route, was 
closed because of flooding brought on by the third Pacific storm in four days. 
The main Amtrak and Burlington Northern railroad line was washed out. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury said 400 people were evacuated in Centralia early today as water rose 
to 3 to 4 feet deep in the town of 11,000 people, 80 miles southwest of 
Seattle. National Guardsmen helped set up shelters at churches. 
</P>
<P>
A firefighter, Tim Evans, said a line of sandbags was laid out late Tuesday by 
a motel, "but the river blew it out." Firefighters were called to the motel 
"and the water was just coming in like the tide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Berg, Lewis County public works director, guessed that 1,000 people 
countywide were out of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Flood warnings were in effect today in Seattle and other cities along Puget 
Sound and eight major rivers in Washington. The National Weather Service 
predicted major damage this afternoon along the Chehalis River in the 
southwestern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt declared an emergency in Clatsop and Tillamook 
counties in the northwest corner of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Flooding in the southern part of Clatsop County was the worst in decades, with 
water 6 feet deep on some roads, said Sheriff John Raichl. 
</P>
<P>
All rivers in Tillamook County were over their banks, said Paul Levesque, the 
county's assistant director of emergency management.

Parents can look forward to 15 months of paid maternity leave after the birth 
of a child, under Sweden's budget proposed today. 
</P>
<P>
The 1990-91 budget proposes extending parental leave -- with the state 
providing 90% of lost income -- from the present 12 months to 15 months 
starting in July of this year, to be taken by either mother or father, whether 
married or unmarried. 
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic government plans to extend the leave to 18 months in 
1991. The family support proposal, at a cost of $2.46 billion the first year, 
is expected to be approved by Parliament.

U.S. and Taiwan officials ended three days of trade talks today without 
reaching agreement on U.S. requests for Taiwan to further open its markets. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kristoff, assistant U.S. trade representative, said the American 
delegation was disappointed at Taiwan's refusal to end import bans on 
high-value U.S. agricultural products and alcoholic beverages and its 
restrictions on U.S. insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
Kristoff, head of the American delegation, said in a statement that her 
delegation also was concerned about the slow progress Taiwan has made in the 
protection of intellectual property rights. 
</P>
<P>
Although Taiwan signed an agreement last year to regulate the showing of 
pirated U.S. films in popular video parlors, she said, "implementation and 
enforcement efforts have not been as rigorous as expected." 
</P>
<P>
But Sheu Ke-sheng, director general of Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade, told 
reporters Taiwan must avoid opening its market too rapidly to avoid causing 
harm to local companies. 
</P>
<P>
Kristoff said Taiwan had made "overall progress" on the implementation of a 
four-year action plan to reduce its trade surplus with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Taiwan proposed to reduce its trade surplus by at least 10% 
each year and cut import tariffs to an average 7% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan cut import tariffs on more than 4,500 items last year under U.S. 
pressure and the rates average about 9.65% now.

The Channel tunnel project between France and Britain was given a new lease on 
life today after banks agreed to release funds to keep workers digging for at 
least four more months. 
</P>
<P>
A banker involved in talks with Eurotunnel SA, the Anglo-French consortium 
overseeing construction and operation of the rail link, estimated the new funds 
at between $500 million and $665 million. 
</P>
<P>
He told Reuters an official announcement will probably be made Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after Eurotunnel settled a dispute with Transmanche 
Link, a group of French and British firms that is building the tunnel, over 
costs that have jumped to more than $11.6 billion from an original estimate of 
$6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Eurotunnel had said the future of the 31-mile undersea link, due to open in 
1993, was in doubt if the banks did not release the funds.

The Soviet-led economic bloc Comecon agreed today to move to a market-based 
system that would replace four decades of rigid central planning and barter 
trade, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
After a two-day session, prime ministers of the 10 Comecon nations decided to 
shift gradually toward trade based on convertible currency and world market 
prices, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A special commission set up to draft changes to the Comecon statutes will make 
proposals next month and meet in Prague in mid-March to discuss them, 
Czechoslovak officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Comecon, which is composed of the seven Warsaw Pact nations plus Cuba, Mongolia 
and Vietnam, has until now decreed who exports what to whom and at what price. 
Its accounting has been done in "transferable rubles" which have no value 
outside the bloc. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was the first since a tide of changes swept through Eastern Europe 
late last year, loosening the Communist grip on power in the area and opening 
the way for Western-style democracy and economics. 
</P>
<P>
"The political situation has changed sharply and there is broad unanimity among 
the European members that we have to move toward a market-type integration," 
said Comecon Executive Committee Chairman Andrei Lukanov of Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Georgi Pirinski told reporters the step-by-step 
move toward hard currency and world prices, first proposed last month by Soviet 
Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, would get under way in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"The transition has to be gradual to take into account balance of payments 
shifts and other negative aspects. . . . We are looking for a soft landing and 
not a hard landing," he said.

Regulators today penalized two directors of the failed Silverado, Banking 
Savings and Loan Assn. in Denver, which once listed President Bush's son Neil 
as a director. 
</P>
<P>
The directors -- Richard K. Vandapool and Robert M. Lewis -- agreed to an order 
prohibiting them from working at any federally insured financial institution 
without prior approval from regulators. 
</P>
<P>
The order covers commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions. 
</P>
<P>
No action was announced against Neil Bush, who served on Silverado's board from 
1985 until August, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But the Office of Thrift Supervision said it is still investigating the 
S&amp;L. The office said it expects to take actions against other former 
Silverado directors and senior management soon. 
</P>
<P>
Vandapool was chief operating officer of Silverado. Lewis was chief financial 
officer. Both formerly were also vice chairmen of Silverado. The two agreed to 
the penalty without admitting or denying the allegations against them.

It will add nonstop service to San Francisco and another direct flight to Los 
Angeles on March 19. 
</P>
<P>
The service will create 107 jobs at the airline, bringing its total employment 
to 827, a spokeswoman for Midwest Express said. Of that total, 714 are based in 
Milwaukee, where the airline is headquartered.

'RAGING BULL' SCORES A KO IN COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HORN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Like a prizefighter returning to the ring after a long layoff, "Raging Bull" 
has come back to movie theaters after a 10-year absence and scored a quick 
knockout at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
Although 1980's "Raging Bull" has enjoyed repeat appearances on television, 
cable and home video, the film grossed $16,311 over the last weekend while 
playing in just two theaters in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good opening, and we're very happy about it," said Jack Foley, 
president of distribution for MGM/UA. "A lot of people haven't seen the movie." 
</P>
<P>
Older films, such as "Laurence of Arabia," tend to sit on the shelf much longer 
than did "Raging Bull." The film's prompt re-release is also unusual because 
the movie is so readily available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Foley said that he hoped to expand the film's distribution to San Francisco, 
Washington, Boston, Chicago, Seattle and other key movie markets soon, and he 
said he hoped that it could move into scores of theaters in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Renewed interest in the film was sparked in part by the selection of "Raging 
Bull" as the best film of the 1980s, as voted by American Film and Premiere 
magazines and the film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"Raging Bull" stars Robert De Niro as boxer Jake LaMotta in a dark drama of one 
man and his many demons. De Niro won a best actor Oscar for his work. The film 
was directed by Martin Scorsese, and co-stars Cathy Moriarty, Joe Pesci and 
Frank Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
Foley said that MGM/UA has spent just less than $100,000 re-releasing the 
movie, and that "it's going to take a long time to break even." He said MGM/UA 
struck new prints of the film from the original negatives so that moviegoers 
would see the film in its pristine state. 
</P>
<P>
When first released, "Raging Bull" was hardly a blockbuster, collecting $22 
million, Foley said. But it has long been admired as one of the classics of 
contemporary American cinema.

CRITICISMS OF MEXICO ON TV'S 'DRUG WARS' UNFAIR, EMBASSY SAYS 
</P>

<P>
Some statements critical of Mexico voiced in NBC News interviews done for the 
television miniseries "Drug Wars" were unfair and possibly made in bad faith, 
the Mexican government contended today. 
</P>
<P>
The program, a dramatization based on the 1985 killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration agent Enrique Camarena, was broadcast Sunday through Tuesday 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
Each episode in the miniseries, produced by the network's entertainment 
division, was followed by a 15-minute interview segment produced by NBC News. 
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government, in a statement distributed at a news conference at its 
embassy here, said "some assertions made by the interviewer, reporter and 
guests are the product of sheer ignorance, imprecise, unfair, lacking of any 
evidence, and, maybe, in bad faith." 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Siegel, executive producer for special broadcasts at NBC News, said the 
network took pains to see that Mexico's point of view was represented and "we 
do not accept the charge that there were any inaccuracies or inconsistencies" 
in its reporting. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Treveino, a spokesman for the embassy, said Mexico was invited to have a 
representative interviewed on the program but declined. 
</P>
<P>
Gustavo Gonzalez, legal adviser to the embassy, said Mexican officials were 
apprehensive that any statements they made could be used by attorneys 
representing the men charged with Camarena's murder. 
</P>
<P>
The statement distributed at the news conference said the killings were "an 
aggressive act by organized crime, and by no means imputable to the Mexican 
government." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said an assertion was made on the program that "Mexico is just 
like Panama, and that drug corruption is deep and pervasive, and that almost in 
every part of the country there is a local Noriega, a comandante, a general, a 
governor getting rich by dealing with Colombian cartel drug bosses." 
</P>
<P>
The statement said this assertion "is not only irresponsible and malign, but it 
also deeply hurts the Mexican people and institutions that are courageously 
fighting drugs every day."

TV ADVERTISERS BALK AT ABC'S 'ROCK HUDSON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several advertisers who found "Rock Hudson" to be "problematic" pulled their 
advertisements from Monday night's made-for-TV movie, Allen Sabinson, the head 
of movies for ABC, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Rock Hudson" was a film biography of the movie and television star who died of 
AIDS in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The movie was based on a book by Hudson's former wife, Phyllis Gates, and court 
records from a civil suit against Hudson's estate brought by Marc Christian, 
Hudson's lover during the last years of Hudson's life. 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers buy some blocks of time -- such as the ABC Monday Night Movie time 
period -- before they know what will be shown. When the schedules are set, 
advertisers are then allowed to preview any programming they think might 
concern them. Several asked to see "Rock Hudson" and then withdrew their ads, 
Sabinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Those advertisers found the film "problematic by subject matter," Sabinson 
said. He added that homosexuality is a "greater taboo" among sponsors than 
other controversial topics such as child molestation, which is the subject of 
"Unspeakable Acts," ABC's Monday movie next week. 
</P>
<P>
Sabinson declined to name the advertisers who withdrew their ads. He also 
declined to indicate how many advertisers removed their commercials. He did say 
he believed that fewer advertisers canceled for "Rock Hudson" than had canceled 
their ads last spring for NBC's "Roe Vs. Wade," a film about the landmark 
abortion rights case that met some of the stiffest advertiser resistance in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Sabinson characterized the advertising community as reluctant to become 
involved with controversial movies and miniseries.

30TH 'WORST-DRESSED' LIST INCLUDES JACKSON, BASINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LaToya Jackson, Roseanne Barr, Demi Moore and Kim Basinger led Mr. Blackwell's 
30th annual list of worst-dressed celebrities today, while praise went to Geena 
Davis, Liza Minnelli, Barbara Bush and Princess Diana. 
</P>
<P>
The acid-tongued critic also flung 1989 fashion darts at Princess Anne, Emily 
Lloyd, Cher, Daryl Hannah and Paula Abdul and gave a shared dishonor to Madonna 
and Sandra Bernhard. 
</P>
<P>
Model-actress Grace Jones won "Fashion Fiasco of the Year" for an outfit 
Blackwell described as "Darth Vader's S-and-M fantasy in a bird cage." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, a pop singer and sister of Michael Jackson, will be the "Cher for the 
'90s" who is "more fashion freak than biker chic . . . in leather and chains," 
Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
Television's Barr was zinged as a "bowling alley reject," former brat-packer 
Moore was "a spandexed 'Nightmare on Willis Street' " and Batman's Miss 
Basinger was a "parading peep-show (who) should be banished to the Batcave."

DERSHOWITZ HIRED BY HELMSLEY

Leona Helmsley has hired Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor who helped 
clear Claus von Bulow of attempted murder, to handle the appeal of her tax 
evasion conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The appeal team also will include Susan Estrich, who headed Michael S. Dukakis' 
unsuccessful presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Dershowitz says Helmsley has been "very pleasant" during their Boston meetings 
and he says her image as a tempestuous shrew is undeserved. "She is demanding 
but I like working for demanding people," he said. "She wants to be sure no 
stone is unturned. Were she a man, she'd be regarded as exacting and 
demanding." 
</P>
<P>
Helmsley, 69, was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million for 
cheating on her taxes but Dershowitz says his review of her records probably 
will show that the government owes her. "This is a woman who paid over $300 
million a year in taxes and she has probably overpaid her taxes," he said.

Robin Leach, host of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," was on hand as emcee 
and there was a small crowd of well-known actors, singers and an Olympic 
athlete, so what was the big event? 
</P>
<P>
It was a celebration of Campbell Soup's 20-billionth can of tomato soup. 
</P>
<P>
The company said the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul were perfect for 
Tuesday's observance because the metropolitan area has one of the highest per 
capita rates of tomato soup consumption in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the ceremony were Rita Moreno and Della Reese, both singers and 
actresses and former Campbell spokeswomen; Jack Scalia, star of the "Wolf" TV 
series and a former worker in Campbell's production plant in Sacramento; Marion 
Ross, a former Minnesotan and mom on the old TV series "Happy Days;" and Jill 
Trenary, a Minnesota native and Olympic figure skater. 
</P>
<P>
The lunch of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches was a far cry from 
Leach's trademark line of "champagne wishes and caviar dreams." 
</P>
<P>
But he shared a cooking tip for spiffing up canned tomato soup -- replace half 
a soup can of water with red wine.

Israeli actor Topol is finally acting his age, even if it's in the same part. 
</P>
<P>
Topol was only 30 when he began playing dairyman Teyve in "Fiddler on the 
Roof," which opens Thursday night at the Forrest Theater here. 
</P>
<P>
The part calls for a man between 55 and 65, and Topol is still only 54. 
</P>
<P>
"At 30, I had to put a lot of energy into the part in order to make it 
believable," he told the Philadelphia Daily News in a telephone interview from 
St. Louis, the production's last stop before Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the father of girls almost my age in real life, husband to a wife in 
real life older than I was," he said. "However, I admit that very early in my 
career I loved to play older characters, probably because it was kind of hiding 
behind the character rather than coming on stage and playing yourself."

New University of Pittsburgh football Coach Paul Hackett continued to make

</P>
<P>
Last week, Hackett fired assistant head coach and defensive coordinator Bob 
Valesente, a close friend of former Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried.

<P>
Hackett told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Tuesday night that he is not ruling 
out further changes.

<P>
"I wouldn't discount anything at this point," he said. "When you've had 20 
years to put together (ideas about) a staff, you have to set sail in the 
direction you want. It's really not a reflection on Bud and Frank at all. . . . 
I just want to get my team in place."

SENNA CAN'T RACE UNTIL HE RETRACTS ALLEGATIONS

Ayrton Senna of Brazil, the 1988 Formula One world champion, will not be 
allowed to race on the Grand Prix circuit this year unless he retracts his 
criticism of the International Automobile Federation, the federation's 
president said today. 
</P>
<P>
Senna has charged that he was manipulated out of any shot at the 1989 world 
driving championship so that Frenchman Alain Prost would win it. Senna's hopes 
for the title ended when he was disqualified in the Japanese Grand Prix, the 
next-to-last race of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"The council will not grant a 1990 super license for the season so long as he 
doesn't change his statements or alter the lies and detriment he caused to 
FISA," federation President Jean-Marie Balestre said. FISA is the International 
Federation of Auto Sports, the governing body of Formula One racing. 
</P>
<P>
Balestre cited a code of conduct regulation requiring all drivers to respect 
the decisions of the sport's governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Senna finished first in the Japanese race but was disqualified for taking a 
short cut after a collision. He bitterly disputed the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that political and economic pressure groups manipulated behind the 
scenes to make Prost this year's champion," Senna said at news conference in 
Sao Paolo, Brazil, on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
He charged that the manipulation was orchestrated by "Jean-Marie Balestre, who 
out of patriotism, friendship or for other reasons I prefer not to mention, 
wanted to see Prost as champion." 
</P>
<P>
Balestre said that he met Senna in December in an effort to make peace but that 
his bid for "reconciliation with Mr. Senna was to no avail." 
</P>
<P>
Senna and his lawyer presented their case in a session with the World Motor 
Council the next day "to explain his slander and his statements," Balestre 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he and members of the world council are very upset by Senna's refusal 
to back down from his statements. 
</P>
<P>
"The international federation showed Mr. Senna there was no manipulation in the 
event," Balestre said. He said the race stewards were correct in disqualifying 
Senna from the Japanese race. 
</P>
<P>
Senna's McLaren team appealed the disqualification, but the decision was upheld 
by the international tribunal. FISA presented a report labeling Senna as a 
dangerous driver and listed past incidents in support of its charge.

LEWIS ADDS TO HIS JOHNSON DRUG CHARGE

Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis says he is sure Canadian track star Ben 
Johnson supplemented his steroid use with an unspecified amphetamine before 
competing in the 100-meter race at the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis made the allegation during an interview with Washington Post reporters 
and editors, which was published today. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody talked about it and knew it," Lewis was quoted as saying. "Five 
weeks earlier in Zurich, he had the same lead over me in Seoul and he lost it. 
Five weeks later, he has the same lead and doesn't lose an inch." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson defeated Lewis in their meeting at the 1988 Olympics with an amazing 
time of 9.79 seconds. But he was discovered to have been using anabolic 
steroids in the weeks before the race and was stripped of his gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's attorney, Ed Futerman, denied both charges. 
</P>
<P>
Futerman said the drug tests in Seoul "speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
"Since Seoul, Ben has been tested two times at random, with 48-hour notice, by 
the Canadian government," Futerman said in a telephone interview from Toronto. 
"Both times he tested negative." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who finished second with a time of 9.92 seconds, was declared the winner 
of the race after Johnson's disqualification and was awarded the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
"In the heats, he would run out of gas. He didn't finish well. But in the 
final, I knew he was taking something . . . for his finish. We're not talking 
about someone who was just playing coy. We're talking about somebody who took 
something," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
He declined to identify the substance he believes Johnson took to enhance the 
performance of the steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis refused to confirm reports that he and Johnson would race after Johnson's 
two-year international suspension is lifted on Sept. 25 but said such a venture 
is "a possibility, 50-50 at best."

Mayor Jacques Chirac unveiled a plan today to restore the famed Champs-Elysees 
to its former glory by widening sidewalks, planting more trees, redesigning 
street furniture and preventing the opening of new fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to give back to the Champs-Elysees the prestige and pleasure of a 
superb promenade," the conservative former prime minister told a news 
conference at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly it has been spoiled." 
</P>
<P>
The plan would eliminate parking on the contre-allees, the minor roads on 
either side of the main avenue. This would enable the sidewalks to be widened 
and covered in granite and a second row of trees to be planted, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
A key part of the plan would be to give the avenue a special status as "a zone 
of protected architectural and urban heritage" to prevent the construction of 
"unsuitable buildings or facades," Chirac said.
